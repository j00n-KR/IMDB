0,Leofwine_draca,Romero's multi-layered epic is still the best zombie film ever made,10,4 June 2016,"George A. Romero's follow-up to his cult classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD arrived some ten years later and featured a greatly expanded budget. While DAWN OF THE DEAD is a direct continuation of where the previous one left off (it's a few weeks later, the zombie virus is spreading rapidly, the rescue stations are closing down), the style of the two films couldn't be more different. While NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was a basically a low-budget movie, filmed on just one set, DAWN OF THE DEAD in comparison feels like an epic; a huge setting, tons of zombies and plenty of special effects. We can only be grateful that Romero finally got the budget to do his zombie movies justice.This time around the film doesn't really concentrate on the conflict between the band of survivors (everybody gets along). Romero injects many of his own political views on feminism, society, etc., and also puts the film on multiple levels. In the first instance it's an action/horror movie, in the second it's a scathing satire on consumerism. Thankfully all this subtext don't detract from the main story, and once again the film succeeds in giving us characters to care about. While some might complain that the film might be a little long, cutting would have resulted in us perhaps losing some sympathy with the characters, losing their little ticks and habits, their expressions, their mentalities.To a mainstream viewer, the cast is completely obscure and unknown. However, Romero picks his actors well and everybody fits their role like a glove. Scott H. Reiniger plays probably the most one-dimensional character of the bunch, a SWAT man who gradually loses his grip with reality and suffers the consequences. David Emge is realistic as an atypical action man with a conscience, who starts off as a novice and learns how to fend for himself throughout the course of the film. Gaylen Ross is the realist of the group, always in touch with the situation, excluded because of her gender, seeing that the mall they occupy isn't a play area but a prison. However it's Ken Foree who excels as the action man who's also intelligent, quick thinking and kind. The only other notable cast members are Tom Savini, SFX master, cameoing as a biker, and a small role for Joe Pilato, who went on to play Captain Rhodes in the next dead film, DAY OF THE DEAD.The special effects are emphasised as the real star of this film, and much is made of the high gore content. Not five minutes go by without zombies getting shot in the head and blood splattering, although all the real cannibalistic gore is saved until the finale and immediately follows some light relief, Romero cruelly playing with our feelings. Arms are torn off, sockets spraying gore, flesh is ripped from legs and necks. It's all pretty horrible and gruesome, and in some ways depressing too. So many zombies and people get killed in this film that you'll need a strong stomach to watch the prolonged bloodshed. It's most horrible when characters we care about get bitten, and Romero works up a lot of suspense from putting them in danger; the truck driving scene being a prime example, plus the lift bit at the end.The music is by Goblin, and is excellent; simplistic, yes, but catchy and downbeat. There are many comedic moments in the film to counter the horror (Romero obviously believed that comic relief should be included intentionally, so that rather than having viewers laugh at a film, they laugh with it instead), such as a zombie getting the top of his head sliced off by a helicopter rotor blade, or zombies falling off balconies and stumbling on escalators. However these silly bits never get in the way of the violence or true horror of the situation, and some bits are painful to watch, especially one scene where a sympathetic character is due to come back from the dead. The wait is unbearable. It is in these moments that we see the genius of Romero's film, as he explores all possibilities and facets of life in a world full of monsters. It's a huge film, it requires a concentrated effort to get through, but will reward on many levels depending on how you watch it.",Dawn of the Dead
1,SnoopyStyle,more than a zombie movie,7,22 February 2015,"The dead are rising and panic is spreading. Martial law is declared. SWAT does battle to clear an apartment building. Stephen Andrews and Francine Parker from a Philadelphia TV station take the traffic helicopter with SWAT members Roger DiMarco and Peter Washington. They find sanctuary in a shopping mall. They struggle to clear the mall of zombies. Francine is pregnant. When Roger turns, Peter shoots him. As they clean up and become comfortable, they start indulging in the mall amenities. Then a gang of bikers find the remaining trio.This starts off as a lowly B-movie horror with lots of outrageous action and amateurish acting. Romero never really figured out how to make a big budget movie. Then he does something interesting. He turns this movie into a semi-comedy about the superficial consumerism that the mall represents. As simple B-movie zombie action, this is really only at most a 6 but Romero is doing a little more than that.",Dawn of the Dead
2,claudio_carvalho,An Insuperable Classic,8,17 November 2004,"The helicopter pilot traffic reporter Stephen (David Emge) and his pregnant lover Francine (Gaylen Ross) decide to steal the radio aircraft and fly to Canada, looking for a safer life without the epidemic of zombies. Their friend Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) and Peter (Ken Foree), two Philadelphia SWAT team members, go with them. Due to the short autonomy of the small helicopter for such a long flight, they seek refugee in an abandoned mall. They clean the place, sealing the entrances and killing the zombies in its interior, and live a quite reasonable life for months, when another external menace threatens the group of survivors. The original 'Dawn of the Dead' is an insuperable classic. Yesterday I watched it again, maybe for the fourth or fifth time, to compare with the recently released remake, and although being a 1978 movie, the special effects are spectacular and the story is amazingly original. The second part of George Romero's trilogy is an excellent horror movie, highly recommended to any fan of this genre. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Zombie  Despertar dos Mortos' ('Zombie  Awakening of the Dead')",Dawn of the Dead
3,classicsoncall,"""These creatures cannot be considered human.""",3,15 August 2018,"I'm probably not the best judge of films like this because I just don't care about zombie flicks. There's something iconic about the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" that couldn't be duplicated in this sequel; part of it could be the use of iconic black and white in filming NOTLD, part of it could simply be the attempt at exploiting a formula that worked in the past. There was hardly even a story here, as it was all about four people trapped in a shopping mall knocking off the undead, and doing a poor job of it in many cases. I couldn't count the number of times I would have used a handgun or a rifle to dispatch a zombie only a few feet away that the principal characters allowed to walk on by. And not too quickly either I might add. Gosh but these zombies were slow. In the future, I think I'll take my zombie cinema in the way of pictures like ""Shaun of the Dead"", that is, with a great big heaping of satirical fun. Not to mention deadpan humor, although I just did.",Dawn of the Dead
4,gavin6942,Zombies and Consumerism... a Match Made in Hell,8,29 November 2010,"The zombies from ""Night of the Living Dead"" have continued their rampage... and our heroes are forced to hole up in a shopping mall. Now they have everything they could ever want, except for the continuous onslaught of the undead.The commentary track is with George Romero, wife Christine Forrest Romero, effects maestro Tom Savini and Anchor Bay DVD guy Perry Martin, who knows this film inside and out... recorded in George's living roomDario Argento's role in this film should not be downplayed, as allegedly the sequel was proposed by Dario Argento, not Romero (though Romero discovered the mall and its crawlspaces prior to Argento's suggestion). Argento's cut of the film was for European markets, with the humor removed to make it more Fulci-like. Luckily, we rarely see that one. The film stars Ken Foree, who went on to do more great things, but Romero alumnus John Amplas shows up (as well as his job as casting director and makeup assistant), and the DP is Michael Gornick, who went on to do directing of his own.Tom Savini tells us that a ""drunken zombie stole a golf cart, drove it around the mall and crashed into a pillar"". Savini makes a great biker, except when he goes through the break-away glass -- the stunt crew poured the glass too thick and he injured his knee. Tom says his work on this film got him ""Friday the 13th"", and one can only wonder how horror would have gone different if he had not been on that film.You really should see this one if you have not, and while watching it, drink some Iron City Beer.",Dawn of the Dead
5,lee_eisenberg,George Romero just keeps 'em coming!,10,16 August 2005,"Even if ""Dawn of the Dead"" didn't have any social commentary, it would still be cooler than cool; after all, that battle between the zombies and the redneck bikers is really something else. But the look at the breakdown in society makes the movie all the better. With anarchy reigning supreme, zombies are taking over. Watching the movie, I got the feeling that it would be kinda neat to get trapped in an abandoned mall with some other people, especially with zombies outside. If you ask me, George Romero deserves a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.Boy, those zombies sure were some bad mothers! I particularly liked that scene where the bikers rode into the mall.",Dawn of the Dead
6,jboothmillard,Dawn of the Dead,10,12 July 2005,"""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth"", a great tagline and quote from a great film and sequel. Ten years since the great black and white zombie horror classic, director George A. Romero returns the story with colour more elaborate gore than its predecessor. Basically the TV stations are still broadcasting their emergency programmes to give the latest information about the continuing undead attacks (more people dying, and being killed by them, and changing into them), and all forces still trying to get rid of them. The story sees four survivors: Stephen (David Emge), black character (always one) Peter (Ken Foree), Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) and Francine (Gaylen Ross) getting in a helicopter and trying to find somewhere to refuel, or better hide and survive. They find what seems to be the perfect spot, a large shopping mall and not too many zombies inside it. For a while they just rush through the slow moving creatures to go in the store and get a few essentials, but eventually they decide to make the mall their own by ridding of all the undead and locking the others outside, with the ensemble of weaponry and almost ""offering themselves"" to tempt them. The scenes of them indulging in all the food, clothes, games and many other products and entertainment of the mall are fun to watch. Of course, by ridding all of the creatures, one of them was bound to be bitten, and Roger is the first victim. Soon enough though, they will be tested when a biker gang invades the mall to devour their thuggish delights, little realising that they will be in the middle of a little shooting war. Also starring David Crawford as Dr. Foster and David Early as Mr. Berman. The critics originally gave the film four stars (out of five), but I have to say it does deserve the extra one, just for the shear quality of gory effects and story. I can see what they mean by the film being a possible satirical attack on American consumerism, but I just like it because it is a great zombie film, and is probably more known with help from the remake by 300 director Zack Snyder and homage in horror comedy Shaun of the Dead. It was number 42 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Outstanding!",Dawn of the Dead

8,BA_Harrison,Romero's brilliant sequel to Night of the Living Dead.,10,21 July 2006,"When Pittsburgh-based auteur George Romero teamed up with Italian giallo genius Dario Argento to bring us the sequel to the seminal drive-in favourite 'Night of the Living Dead', a genre-defining classic was created which was to influence horror-movie makers for decades to come. 'Dawn of the Dead' is a deservedly revered masterpiece which intelligently mixes social commentary with nerve-jangling terror, black humour and buckets of gore; not many film-makers manage to do that!Since the first movie, the phenomenon that caused the dead to rise has continued unabated and zombies now threaten to outnumber the living. Panic is starting to set in amongst the survivors and the fabric of society is falling apart.The film opens in a TV station where a crew desperately put together reports on the situation, and interviews with experts are broadcast on emergency channels. The feeling of hopelessness is immediately apparent. We then cut to a tenement building which is under siege. A SWAT team breaks in to discover that the inhabitants haven't been handing their dead over to the authorities for disposal, and the place is swarming with zombies. At this point the blood really hits the fan and we are introduced to Tom Savini's inventive comic-book gore which is very gruesome and brilliantly shocking, with exploding heads, limb chewing and gut-munching aplenty.Two members of the SWAT-team decide that the time has come to head for safer ground, and together with a helicopter pilot and his pregnant girlfriend, they set off to find somewhere free of shuffling reanimated corpses.They eventually land their chopper on the roof of a huge mall to search for supplies, but soon realise that it might make sense to make the shopping centre home for a while, until they have a chance to make better plans. They set about blocking the entrances and clearing the mall of zombies, and for a while they live a carefree life with everything they need at their fingertips. It is in this setting that Romero makes his sly comments on consumerism (comparing shoppers to zombies) and the materialistic mentality of the average person.But all good things come to an end, and disaster eventually arrives in the form of an army of bikers who break down the mall doors, intent on laying their hands on some of the goodies within. The barriers broken, the undead also swarm in and all hell breaks loose.Despite a massive 139 minutes running time, Romero's 'Director's Cut' is pure horror heaven from start to finish. Considering the relatively low budget, the movie delivers on every level. The acting is, for the most part, very good, with only the odd bit-part zombie hamming it up and yet another poor performance from FX man Savini (his gore is great but he can't act to save his life!). The story is well written with great dialogue and the characters behave believably given their extreme circumstances (with the only exception being the ludicrous biker, who insists on checking his blood-pressure before being ripped apart!!). The blood letting is extremely well done with some wonderful gore set pieces that, despite their cartoonish appearance, still manage to disgust. And to cap it all, the soundtrack by Goblin fits perfectly.'Dawn of the Dead' is a landmark in the history of horror film that should be seen by every fan of the genre.",Dawn of the Dead
9,paul_haakonsen,After the night comes dawn...,7,21 January 2016,"There is just something enthralling about the Romero zombie movies, even the ones that were part of the original trilogy: ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Day of the Dead"". And this 1978 release is no different. It is a hard-hitting and deep impacting story that Romero mustered together for ""Dawn of the Dead"", and a very memorable one at that.I assume that you are already familiar with the storyline in ""Dawn of the Dead"", be it from the 1978 version or the 2004 re-make. But a short recap of the story is: A group of survivors in a zombie breakout take shelter in a massive mall. And with the numbers of the living dead growing outside with each day, life inside the mall is not all as comfy and safe as one would imagine.Romero told a good story, and the special effects team really helped bring the movie to life on the screen. And despite it being from 1978, then the effects and gore still do manage to hold their own even today. Outdated by today's standards, yes, but still serving their purpose as intended. And with Tom Savini in charge of the effects, you know that you will get some good stuff.The cast in ""Dawn of the Dead"" was good, and there were some memorable actors that managed to leave some lasting impressions in their performances, and I am of course thinking of Ken Foree here.""Dawn of the Dead"" is also an important milestone in the zombie genre, just as ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Day of the Dead"" are. And George A. Romero really did establish that he is the father of the living dead, so to speak.I have watched ""Dawn of the Dead"" many times, just as I have with ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Day of the Dead"". It just never grows old. And if you are a zombie aficionado then you should already be more than familiar with these movies. If you aren't, shame on you. And even to newcomers to the zombie genre, then ""Dawn of the Dead"" is a movie that should be watched, as it was one of the founding movies that helped define the zombie genre.",Dawn of the Dead
10,Quinoa1984,Still my favorite horror film...,10,10 February 2000,"When you want brutal, look no further, but when you also want to see perhaps the greatest of all comic-book movies not based on a comic-book, it's in George Romero's original take on his continuing mythology. It's not just one of the towering horror films, or horror comedies (what will a poor dead fellow do when the escalator starts?!) but one of the great sequels, more ambitious and ass-kicking than its predecessor, with a filmmaker more confident and technically proficient with his abilities.Romero didn't originally want to do *any* sequel to his original 'Night', but after a visit by some friends to a soon-to-open mall nearby his hometown of Pittsburgh, it struck a chord as to who would be coming here – and what so much consumerism in one place would mean. ""Why do they come here?"" one of the four survivors that happens upon this mall swarming with these flesh-eaters asks another. ""This meant something to them. Instinct, maybe. This was an important part of their lives,"" he responds.I don't think necessarily Romero meant to show the film as any sort of 'This is what will happen!"" type of social horror thing. It's more about, this is where we are at NOW, and in that sense, though broader and a whole LOT bloodier, it holds a place right next to a film like Network as one of the magnificent satires of its time and place, and as much about what the public is like. Romero acts as both pessimist and optimist in this world though; past all the chopped limbs, exploding heads (oh yeah!), Tom Savini stunt and make-up and intestines ripped apart, what holds up the film for me is seeing these four characters come to grip with the horror they've made for themselves, holding up in this ""paradise"" of a mall.Balls-to-the-wall horror, social horror, and some genuine paranoid horror stuff (note to self, never try and fire a gun at a single zombie when in a dark room full of electrical wiring and pipes), and plenty of rock and roll attitude, this is a personal favorite and the most entertaining horror film of its time. And the Goblin music soundtrack yummy.",Dawn of the Dead
11,BandSAboutMovies,I grew up in this mall,9,4 October 2020,"As we entered the dumbest and most boring apocalypse ever this year, I discovered that every plan, every zombie escape strategy I had, none of it mattered. Instead, I would sit in my living room and watch moronic leaders fight over whether or not we would wear a mask, people willing to die to eat at TGI Friday's and actual liberty get booed by people who shouldn't even be allowed to sit in the stands at a football game.If George Romero was around, he wouldn't be surprised, other than the fact that our end is so bloodless, so pointless, so vanilla.I watched Dawn of the Dead so many times that I could recite it at will in high school. Obviously, my goal was not to get laid. It was to study this movie over and over.While the rest of the world had to wait until now for the end times, Pittsburgh knew it was real long before, when our church of commerce was taken over in the middle of the night by a bunch of maniacs and filmed evidence would confirm every one of our greatest fears. Like Pogo told us we met the enemy and it was us. It still is.Where Night of the Living Dead took place inside a cramped farmhouse, Dawn would take place in Monroeville Mall, a place that now has a bust of Romero and a photo of Dario Argento that refers to him as a ""castmember."" The humor of this caption makes me overjoyed.Romero knew one of the mall's developers, who showed him the secret areas behind the mall, and told the director that people could survive a disaster inside the mall. He now had an idea for the movie, but he couldn't find anyone in America to help make it. That's how Dario Argento came in and made his way to Pittsburgh.Shooting from 11 PM to 7 AM, when the holiday music would come on and couldn't be stopped, the filmmakers - joined by a creative cast and crew, including special FX maniac Tom Savini*, made a movie that influenced the whole world and every horror film that would follow in its wake.Where the zombie plague was confined to Evans City before, now the end of the world has expanded and much like how no one can agree on how to fix a simple plague these days, no one can agree on how to properly battle the newly dead getting up and killing those that they once loved.Stephen ""Flyboy"" Andrews (David Emge, Hellmaster) and Francine Parker (Gaylen Ross, Creepshow) are planning on stealing the traffic helicopter from the TV station they work at and escaping Philadelphia. They're joined by SWAT officers Roger DiMarco (Scott Reiniger, Knightriders) and Peter Washington (Ken Foree, who is in so many horror movies, but let's go with Death Spa) and land in Monroeville, hiding inside the mall and clearing it of the undead.All the consumerism is too much. The living dead want to get into the mall, remembering their past lives, which were simply consuming. Now that money doesn't matter, nothing that was worthwhile in the mall does either. The foursome decides to leave, but Roger has grown too reckless and is bitten. And one night, a gang of motorcyclists break in and allow the zombies to crash through the barricades. Stephen, angry at his loss of home, flips out and kills several bikers before he is bit.As he turns and follows his former friends into their hiding place, the urge to give up is too much. Originally, Peter would shoot himself and Francine would walk headfirst into the helicopter blades. But in the small window of happiness here, the pregnant heroine lives as the black cop decides to stay alive and save her. We see them fly away to an uncertain future.While the American version of this film is 127 minutes and features a mix of library music and the Goblin soundtrack, Dario Argento's Italian cut, known as Zombi, features more of Goblin and cuts out any of the film's comic book humor, concentrating on providing more action. It would lead to a revolution in Italian horror, of course.I've debated featuring this movie on our site for some time. It means so much to me, but I didn't know what else I could say about it that hadn't been said. Yet today, as I sit here and wonder just how bad the world is going to get by the end of this year, I see that the zombie apocalypse that I spent my life preparing for - influenced by this movie - is almost preferable to the Fourth Reich or Civil War that we seem to be heading toward. I can only hope that a few years from now, I'll read this and laugh at all the hyperbole. Or maybe I'll be fortifying the Exchange on Miracle Mile, surrounding my wife and myself with guns, DVDs and all the supplies we need to survive. Because after all, when there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the Earth.*Nearly every stunt in this movie was done by Savini and Taso N. Stavrakis, including a dive over a rail that led to the effects master nearly breaking his legs when he missed his mark.",Dawn of the Dead
12,Coventry,Here's ONE zombie movie that buries all the others!,10,27 September 2006,"There's not much use denying it George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" is one of the chosen few, absolute greatest horror films ever made and it's fairly unimaginable that a powerful movie like this will ever come out again. Even more than its 1968 predecessor, the landmark known as ""Night of the Living Dead"", this film contains literally everything to satisfy even the most demanding fan of horror cinema. Some films attempt to reach a maximum level of high tension throughout; some have eminent directors and/or a professional cast; some horrors will distinguish themselves from the rest by providing a lot of gore & gruesome make-up effects and others completely rely on uniquely atmospheric set pieces and filming locations. ""Dawn of the Dead"" consists of ALL these trademarks and yet a whole lot more! This film more or less begins where ""Night"" ended, with an alarming increase of zombies that feast their way through America. The opening sequences masterfully capture the growing sense of mass hysteria and disbelief in a TV-studio, where a 'scientist' warns the population not to regard these walking corpses as former family members or friends, but as mere monsters on the constant lookout for human flesh to feed on. These scenes introduce Peter and Francine, who plan to escape the big city in a helicopter. Cut to another very perplexing series of action sequences in which fellow policemen Stephen & Peter battle their way through a zombie-infested apartment building. Eventually these four characters flee together and entrench themselves in a large shopping mall complex. They can fairly easily handle the menace of the zombies here, but the biggest danger comes from typical human greed and selfishness. It's downright amazing how Romero manages to present such an implausible topic like zombie mayhem in such a realistic and incredibly disturbing way. He already did that in ""Night of the Living Dead"" but ""Dawn"" is entirely different film all together, since it contains a lot more humor and intelligently subtle society-mockery. The gore is sensational and plentiful (thank you, Tom Savini!) but the film never at one point drags in the tension or bad editing department. It's just, in one word, the perfect horror movie. There exist more than a dozen different versions of this film, which are all worth seeing at least once if only to spot the differences. Particularly recommended are Romero's original director's cut (duh!!) and Argento's European cut. This latter cuts a little on the dialogues and humor, but it features another brilliant soundtrack by Goblin! I could easily write another five page-essay about the genius of this movie, but it would just constantly re-confirm that it's absolute must-see! In case you haven't yet, make ""Dawn of the Dead"" a priority and also make sure you've got the horror-munchies!",Dawn of the Dead
13,Theo Robertson,Compelling Despite Its Short Comings,7,8 April 2004,If this review is lacking then apologies but I find it a difficult film to review mainly down to the fact I`ve seen it umpteen times since the early 1980s . Unfortunately I first saw it on video which meant DAWN OF THE DEAD gets lumped into the rest of the video nasties that came out at the same time . In fact all my peers believed it to be a sequel to ZOMBI FLESH EATERS when it`s a sequel to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD . Incidentally most of those same peers liked ZOMBI FLESH EATERS but postively hated NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEADIt`s certainly flawed as is everything Romero has done . The acting is amatuerish and it`s no surprise that the cast didn`t go onto bigger things . The technical aspects suffer badly from the lack of budget like the sound where it`s sometimes difficult to hear the dialogue while the editing is all over the place in some scenes and as for the make up it`s sometimes laughable or sometimes non existant . All this is a great pity since there is a truly great story in here somewhere . If truth be told DAWN suffers from the fact that like 28 DAYS LATER the zombi element overwhelms the main story which is trying to be a gritty and realistic survivalist drama along the same lines as Romero`s earlier bleak and depressing THE CRAZIES . Despite the flaws this an intelligent film which concentrates on human interaction and relationshipsBy the way the BBC showed the director`s cut last night and I can see what the problem was with it . I really enjoyed the exploding head but there`s far too many scenes where the camera lovingly lingers on the gore . The gore isn`t distressing in anyway but as I said it`s unintenionally laughable as zombies tear open stomachs and stuff that looks like cooked macaroni pops out of victims bodies,Dawn of the Dead
14,Hey_Sweden,"Attention, shoppers, we have a special on bloody body parts.",8,28 October 2020,"Writer / editor / director George A. Romero follows up his legendary, groundbreaking ""Night of the Living Dead"" a decade after the fact with this impressive sequel. In depicting a world gone straight to Hell, he completely succeeds. As the zombie population explodes, chaos erupts among the human survivors. Four disparate characters escape together: a helicopter pilot named Stephen (David Emge), his television executive girlfriend Francine (Gaylen Ross), and two Philadelphia SWAT team members, Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger (Scott H. Reiniger). They discover an isolated, abandoned mall, and decide to set up shop there. They manage to create a fairly idyllic existence for themselves, until a band of marauding bikers (led by Tom Savini) turn up to raise some Hell.Romero really outdoes himself with his level of ambition here, as he uses the format of the zombie film to make comment on American life - and mall culture - circa 1978. It's an intelligent, measured script that offers solid roles to an engaging quartet of actors; it also contains a smattering of memorable lines that fans of the film just love to quote. In opening the scope of his action, Romero isn't telling quite as intimate a story as before. And yet, the zombies are not as big a factor, or are quite as menacing, as they were before. In fact, the zombies are treated as pathetic characters capable of earning some sympathy. You can't help but feel bad for them when the bikers are doing things like smashing pies in their faces. Still, they have the ability to do some serious damage should the lead characters let down their guard, or get overconfident, as indeed Roger does.Savini's gore is truly something to see, although the best bits do occur within the first and last half hours. The music by Goblin is a delight and helps to set an atmosphere. Location shooting at the Monroeville Mall is superb, with Romero and company making use out of many spots within the structure. Supporting our four stars are a rich variety of familiar faces from the Romero filmography: John Amplas (also the casting director), Christine Forrest (Romero's wife and assistant director), David Early, Richard France. Character actor James A. Baffico makes the most of his early, brief screen time as a racist, live wire cop named Wooley. Savini is also fun as a swaggering antagonist and does some of the stunts as well.""Dawn of the Dead"" is overall a very interesting and pointed look at this whole idea of consumerism, with the zombies possibly amassing at this shopping centre because their visits to this place remain ingrained in their minds, no matter the circumstances.It's a must-see, not only for zombie film fans, or horror fans in general, but any lover of film.Eight out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead
15,preppy-3,Drags a little but still worth seeing,7,23 July 2006,"Sequel to ""Night of the Living Dead"". In this one it seems the dead are taking over the country. Four people (three men, one woman) escape to a shopping mall and try to fight off the living dead and figure out what to do.It starts off great with a confusing and VERY gory sequence and then sort of slows down when they get to the mall. There are still the occasional bouts of gore but it quickly turns into a satire on consumerism! There's nothing wrong with that but it makes that point...and keeps rubbing it in the audiences face. It slowly starts to get dull...until a gory rampage kicks in to end the movie.In 1978 this was considered a strong movie in terms of gore and satire. The gore still works (there's a lot and it's graphic) but the satire seems very dated now. Still this is a classic--in its way. It was released unrated but no one under 17 was allowed in the theatre. Despite that it was a big hit and a rare horror film that critics actually liked. I remember finding this great back in 1979--but it seems kind of weak and dated over 20 years later. However the gore still holds up and it does have a few moments guaranteed to make you jump. Great music score too. I do agree it's a classic but I can truthfully only give the movie a 7. The satire really weighs this down.",Dawn of the Dead
16,grantss,Entertaining,7,30 May 2020,"The zombie apocalypse has hit Earth. Two personnel from a TV station and two policemen set off in a helicopter to find a safe place to hide out. Their search leads them to a shopping mall where they manage to find a place that, while not zombie-free, is quite secure. So far, so good.I am generally not into zombie movies but Dawn of the Dead worked for me. Written and directed by the master of the zombie genre, George A Romero, the film is entertaining and largely avoids the pitfalls that makes the average zombie movie at best B-grade.For one, it has a decent plot. There's a setup and development plus a great unforeseen twist. The average zombie movie just launches into the humans vs zombies confrontation without much of set up, or a token one at best. After that it's a series of clashes between the two sides until someone discovers the secret to exterminating the zombies, or kills their ringleader.Allied to this, there's few contrivances and the plot mostly makes sense (except for the zombie bit, of course). No deus ex machinas, few discontinuities or inconsistencies. (Though not sure why the biker decided to test his blood pressure while surrounded by zombies...).Not perfect though. Performances are generally so-so. Ken Foree, Gaylen Ross and David Emge are okay (though hardly brilliant) in their roles but Scott H Reiniger, as Roger, hams it up. Some of the supporting actors do their best to make this into a B-grade movie: the psycho cop at the beginning of the film took overacting to a whole new level.In addition, the conclusion is a bit tame and anti-climactic. I was expecting something more powerful.Overall: one of the best zombie dramas. Not that this really says that much, considering the genre, but it is entertaining, not matter what genre it is categorised as.",Dawn of the Dead
17,Boba_Fett1138,Horror fun in a shopping mall.,10,17 July 2004,"This movie was not what I expected it to be like. I expected a tense movie with lot's of scares but instead I got to see a fun horror movie with lots of black-humor, I was pleasantly surprised!Nothing is more fun than watching a couple of zombies falling over each other and over things in a shopping mall with some typical shopping mall music on the background. I already thought this movie was fun, so I wonder how much fun ""Shuan of the Dead"" will be, which will be released in the Netherlands mid August of this year if I'm not mistaken.But luckily the movie doesn't really make fun of itself. It still is somewhat realistic and the characters and the story make it even more believable and makes of this movie a real classic! The gore is brutal and very daring and that alone makes this movie worth watching and unique in its kind and for its time.Not sure if it's the best horror movie of all time but it certainly is an entertaining one!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Dawn of the Dead
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The best,10,10 October 2009,"This is an excellent film, with compelling social commentary and satire, among other things on materialism. Just as ""Night"", this wastes no time getting to the terrifying situation, and this might lack the immediate nature of the threat, but it certainly makes up for it in the massive scope. If this series had not convinced you before of the chaos, it will with this. Tension is built expertly, and this is immensely scary. Not only is this vastly superior to all zombie-flicks(including the excellent original, and the immediate sequel to this), it also surpasses an awful lot of other horror movies. I base this review on the Director's Cut, with a running time of 139 minutes... I have only seen that, and Dario Argento's European/Italian version, which changes the music and tone and comes in at about two hours, and loses some of the magnificent character development and fitting humor(going for a faster pace and more action). He also . It is also worth watching, though I do urge you to find the DC if you can, for the initial viewing. Intensity is often rather high, and you never forget the situation. This is not escapism. As in the first of the franchise, no one here is really stupid just for the sake of it(without them being unrealistically unemotional, either), and we aren't presented with anyone that we are purely meant to hate(if a lot seem to dislike Stephen). Many really smart things are done by them, and you aren't pulled out of this by that irritating realization of ""if I were in this situation, I would certainly not do *that*"". The acting is solid, Foree is great, and Ross does marvelous, portraying a quick-thinking and capable woman. Writing is sharp, and nothing feels unnecessary, or like it doesn't belong. Dialog is well-delivered and doesn't feel forced. The special effects are incredible, and there are some unforgettable sights in this. Editing and cinematography are masterful. The Trilogy of the Dead box-set comes with a trailer, TV spots, a radio ad, a photo gallery with 8 stills and 20 posters and the like. This is quite gory, bloody, violent and disturbing, and there is occasional strong language. Sexuality is limited almost entirely to brief nudity. I recommend this to anyone who believe they have the nerves and the stomach for it. Heck, even if you don't get and/or aren't interested in the deeper meanings, it's impeccably well-done. 10/10",Dawn of the Dead
19,view_and_review,Good Until the End,5,15 June 2019,"I thought the movie was solid up until the end. Besides the zombies I saw a lot of parallels between this and The Walking Dead. It's clear that The Walking Dead borrowed some ideas from this movie: the slow moving undead, the settling in a fortified location, and the dealing with malicious human beings.The movie was moving along a particular arc until the very end when Peter decided to be suicidal. Well, until he wasn't. The whole mall is getting overrun by zombies, they've found their hidden upstairs location so it is clearly time to get in the helicopter and leave. Instead, he tells the woman to go ahead because he's done. Peter has decided he's not going to run anymore he is done with life. She goes up to the chopper, fires it up, and waits. Peter goes into a room, grabs a little gun, points it at his head, and waits. Once zombies breach the little room Peter was in he has second thoughts and decides he wants to live.That was the point I thought the movie just derailed; not completely but somewhat. Either he's going to commit suicide or he's not. Because, by waiting until the horde of zombies was on him his fate should have been sealed. At that point he should have either killed himself or been zombie food. Alas, he narrowly escapes, gets into the chopper, and they go wherever they go. I did not like that ending. They should've either gone earlier or she should have gone and left him to die.",Dawn of the Dead
20,evanston_dad,These Zombies Should Know When to Quit,5,1 March 2006,"A lot of people have tried really hard to read all sorts of subtext into George Romero's big-budget sequel to his unlikely 1968 hit ""Night of the Living Dead,"" but I remain a dissenter. Yes, yes, I do believe that Romero in an off-hand and cheeky way is lampooning American consumerism by setting his zombie-fest in a mall, where the undead begin to take on the glazed, staring look of end-of-day shoppers. And there is some significance in the fact that the humans become their own worst enemies by the time the film is done; the zombies hardly seem to matter anymore when anarchy breaks out among the still living. But Romero's commentary falls way short of profundity, and the movie as a whole is nowhere near as effective or compelling as the original.""Night of the Living Dead"" goes down as one of the top 10 scariest movies I've ever seen, so I was really disappointed that there wasn't a scare to be had in this sequel. Color isn't kind to Romero's vision, and what looked stark and frightening and ghoulish in grainy b&w ten years earlier looks cheesy and stupid ten years later. The zombie makeup effects are horrible. And this movie's just too long. There's simply not enough story to sustain a running time of two hours. ""Night of the Living Dead"" knew its limitations; the scares came quickly, cheaply and shockingly. ""Dawn of the Dead"" is overblown and pushed nearly to pointlessness.A disappointing, lacklustre sequel to an inarguably classic film.Grade: C+",Dawn of the Dead
21,Uriah43,Blood and Guts,8,11 October 2012,"Some people believe that ""Dawn of the Dead"" is the greatest zombie film ever made. I respectfully disagree. While it is certainly ""one of the best"", I am a firm believer that its predecessor, ""Night of the Living Dead"", deserves that honor. Be that as it may, this movie essentially takes up where ""Night of the Living Dead"" left off. The zombies have multiplied to an extent that society has broken down and chaos has emerged. In this environment, four humans (3 men and 1 woman) have escaped by helicopter to an abandoned shopping mall. Realizing that this is a good place to hide out, they decide to make it their temporary home. It has food, liquor, guns and ammunition. It even has an arcade for entertainment. Their main task then, is to secure the mall to keep the zombies out. Once this is accomplished though, the zombies on the outside continue to want to get in. And they never quit trying. Unfortunately, the zombies aren't the only ones who want to get in. At any rate, rather than give away the entire storyline I'll just say that this film has plenty of blood and guts for the hard-core fans of this genre. It also has some humorous scenes interspersed throughout as well. And while some of the humor is a bit over-the-top, it just seems to fit in for some reason. The acting is decent and the director (George A. Romero) is probably the world's greatest expert when it come to this kind of film. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I think that most zombie fans would probably say the same thing.",Dawn of the Dead
22,Aaron1375,"Chaos, anarchy and zombies! Welcome to the Dawn of the Dead!",9,31 October 2016,"This film is the second of Romero's ""Dead"" trilogy; granted, he did make a few other zombie films after this one: ""Land of the Dead"", ""Diary of the Dead"" and ""Survival of the Dead"", but I do not really count those three as part of his first three dead films. They just seem in a separate world as this series shows us the beginning of the zombies, the zombies taking over and gaining more footing and the end of civilization as we know it as by the last film the zombies outnumber the humans. This is the second film and it shows the structure we humans have established beginning to crumble. This one is also the most action oriented of the three ""Dead"" films. I would say the first is the most horror oriented and the third has elements of horror, action and science fiction. Of the original three, this is my favorite one. It has really cool zombie action and I like the main characters especially Peter and Roger...Fran and Stephen got on my nerves from time to time. The third film would have a myriad of annoying and unlikable characters with the most likable by far being Bub. Bub also happens to be a zombie so that should tell you how they are. That one features some really good zombie action and a better climax than this film though. The climax here almost seems like Romero thought he had to have some zombie munching and could not quite figure out a way to do so seeing as how there were only four main characters and so the ending, while featuring some awesome zombie munching, also seems kind of thrown in as an after thought.The story has things beginning to break down rapidly as two people working at television station plan to nab the company chopper to try and escape the horror that the city has now become as marshal law is in effect and things are going badly quickly. Two guys who are in a raid of an apartment complex that goes horribly also join the two reporters and there are some tensions at first as they fly through the countryside and witness the growing number of zombies first hand. They soon find a mall with a helicopter landing pad on top of it and decide to stay and rest a bit at first, but then Roger and Peter decide that perhaps they should stay a little longer as the place has everything one could need to survive out the zombie outbreak. They convince Stephen, though Fran is never too on board with the idea as apparently her and Stephen's original plan was to get to Canada. Soon they all work together to try and blockade the mall, lock down the mall and then rid the mall of the zombie infestation. All looks well until the here some people on the radio who do not have the best of intentions.This one is the most action oriented of the first three films as I have said and I liked the characters in this one more than the other two films as well. The zombie effects are okay and there are some good kills, but both of those two things would be improved upon in the next entry. I am always a bit surprised that the guy playing Roger did not appear in all that many films as he was actually really good. About the only one who would go on to appear in several films is Ken Foree who would appear in a lot of horror films during his career.So this film is rather good, but it is dated a bit. You watch this film and you are looking at a time capsule of the 70's that is for sure. The fact that they reference the indoor mall makes it seem like that was a relatively new and happening thing thing when these days it is the outdoor malls that thrive more often. I would hate to get stuck in a mall these days as you just could not find the supplies that a mall had back in those days. Not even talking about guns, I am talking about food, tools and several other essential items that just are not going to be in a mall nowadays. Most malls only really have clothing shops so you are not going to survive very long unless you are good at crafting hangers into weapons or eating clothing and converting it to energy! Still, it is a fun ride and a very good zombie film.",Dawn of the Dead
23,Wuchakk,Romero's imaginative and thrilling zombie sequel,8,22 August 2018,"A decade after the excellent ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968), writer/director George Romero offers up this exceptional sequel. The plague of reanimated corpses with a hunger for warm flesh is now global and society is increasingly breaking down. A television exec (Gaylen Ross), her helicopter-reporter beau (David Emge) and two SWAT officers (Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger) take refuge in a suburban mall. Unfortunately for them, a veritable army of biker-raiders wants the mall for their own.One of the main reasons this film is so iconic is because Romero seriously considered what it would be like after a 'zombie apocalypse' and came up with an inspired story. While the bleakness of the situation is addressed there's also a sense of adventurous freedom; for instance, the protagonists having an entire mall to themselves.The movie's disturbing, ghastly and gory, but also action-packed and sometimes humorous. The zombies make for good bullet fodder while, at the same time, satirizing consumer society. The creative score is varied and I'm sure it was cutting edge at the time, but it's very dated today, although you'll probably find yourself acclimating to it. The no-name cast is convincing with the towering Foree standing out while Emge comes across as a poor man's Donald Sutherland.The movie runs 2 hours, 7 minutes with the longer version running 2 hours, 19 minutes (the one I watched). It was shot in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, and nearby Pittsburgh.GRADE: A-",Dawn of the Dead
24,The_Void,An undeniable masterpiece of cinema,10,27 December 2004,"Dawn of the Dead is concrete proof that extreme gore and violence doesn't always equal a dumb movie and that the two can make very nice bedfellows indeed. This film is a rare thing in that it will please both gorehounds and fans of art cinema, and there isn't a vast amount of films that do that. Aside from doing what I've just mentioned, this follow up to Night of the Living Dead established George Romero as a household name in many a gore fan's home and his trilogy of zombie films will ensure for ever more that the name 'Romero' and the zombie film will always go hand in hand. The plot of this film follows four survivors of the zombie apocalypse that has ensued after the events of Night of the Living Dead as they hold up in a shopping mall to try and hide from the events going on in the outside world. However, this poses another problem, as once their home has been built up in the midst of the atrocities; will our hero's be able to give up all that they have built?The commentary on society and the trappings of consumerism that Romero appears to be keen to implement in his film come off as being somewhat muddled, due to the fact that it's lost under the reality that what we see our hero's doing makes absolute perfect sense. This, however, is where the genius behind the commentary comes into play; it's a depiction of what people within a consumerist society would do in this situation, which makes the commentary all the more potent. Despite it being a film about zombies, Romero implements a sense of realism into the proceedings, which works due to the fact that he never overindulges in anything. Sure, the gore towards the end is over the top; but even that is realistic as it is what you would expect a zombie massacre to be. Because of his sense of realism, we are able to care for the characters that Romero has presented us with, even though we really know little about them. The audience is able to put themselves into their situation and we are constantly given the feeling that we are actually involved in the events on screen. This makes the ending of the movie more potent by way of the sense of security that Romero has lulled you into throughout the movie, and at the end; we really feel for what is happening to our characters and even though we want to see the massacre happen (as that's why we're watching the film at the end of the day), we sort of don't want to see it at the same time. This kind of mind-game isn't carried off successfully very often, but Romero has it down to an art form here.The movie benefits massively from a great score by Dario Argento's house band, Goblin. In fact, with the obvious exception of Suspiria; I would even go as far as to say that this is their best work ever. The score blends so well with the happenings on screen that it's impossible to have one without the other. Some films have a superfluous score, or one that doesn't add anything to the film; but it's undeniable that the score of Dawn of the Dead not only adds to what we're seeing, but 'makes' it. As many people will be tuning in to see gore, I am pleased to tell you that this film doesn't disappoint in that respect. It's one of the goriest films ever made, with many sequences reaching a level of disgustingness that is rarely seen in cinema (intestine dinner, anyone?). As you are probably aware, Tom Savini did the make-up effects for Dawn of the Dead and it is the film that made his career and established him as the gore guru that he is often seen as today. The film is also notable for a certain line that has been quoted more times than any other line uttered in any other horror movie. I am of course talking about the fabulous; ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the Earth"".Dawn of the Dead is undoubtedly one of the most important films ever made. It inspired a barrage of rip-off's that are still being made today and it stands tall on many a horror fan's list of favourite horror films. Dawn of the Dead is one of the most recent films to inspire a remake and, unfortunately, it turned out to be terrible. Not that it matters, as the original is where it's at; and this film is an undeniable masterpiece.",Dawn of the Dead
25,Mr-Fusion,Classic!,10,30 October 2012,"Zombie saturation point has already been reached, but I will always have a soft spot for ""Dawn of the Dead"". It's one of my all-time favorite horror movies (even if, admittedly, that's not my go-to genre). But it beautifully works on two fronts: One, as a tight, well-assembled apocalypse movie. It yanks your attention from minute one - between that first image of red sound carpeting to the tension in the TV studio, then moves straight into action movie. And seeing as half of our main characters are reckless cowboys, there's fun to be had here. And two, as a commentary on our consumerist society. What better way to tackle that then by setting things in a shopping mall? And Romero doesn't just sermonize; some of the movie's best scenes involve running wild in an abandoned shopper's paradise. And in a zombie apocalypse, who among us could resist? It's satire both biting and funny.For me, ""Dawn of the Dead"" plays like a timewarp to the late '70s. that was a real mall, so the set's authentic, and it textures the movie unbelievably well It doesn't look anything like (the remaining) malls do now and that makes it a great place to visit, if only in the movies.But what a movie!10/10",Dawn of the Dead
26,HumanoidOfFlesh,George A.Romero's classic of zombie mayhem.,9,27 February 2001,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is possibly one of the greatest zombie flicks ever made.With effects by Tom Savini,this gory horror film really shocked the s**t out of people when it was released,but today it seems not really that bloody.It doesn't matter at all,because ""Dawn of the Dead"" features fantastic storyline,violent action sequences,great characters and the ending,which is literally splashed with gore.Plenty of gross-out moments like when a guy has his head blown off with a shotgun,a woman has a big chunk of flesh taken out of her shoulder and her wrist etc.I love especially the ending,which is very brutal with beheadings,stabbings,limbs being ripped off,people ripped apart and eaten and bloody shootings.If you love horror movies,you must see this gem.My other recommendations:""Day of the Dead"",""Zombi 2"",""Burial Ground"" and ""City of the Living Dead"".",Dawn of the Dead
27,christopher-underwood,it was great then and is still great,9,27 December 2020,"This is a very fine film and it looks absolutely wonderful on the new Blu-ray presentation by Second Sight. I saw this upon its original theatrical release and it was great then and is still great. The inspired idea to set the action in a shopping centre, or mall, was a masterstroke both for budgetary reasons, it being a ready made set and for the wondrous irony implicit in the seemingly aimless wanderings of the zombie shoppers. Romero manages to keep up the momentum from those hectic and worryingly puzzling opening scenes right to the bloody end. I just felt watching it once more that it maybe could loose a few moments just before the last half hour sets in, that maybe one or two moments of humour could be trimmed and that a more full throttle Goblin soundtrack might have been more effective. All set for the Argento cut then available in the same set. Brilliant. UPDATE 28.12.20: Perhaps surprisingly all three of us were up for watching this again 24 hours later but this time in the Argento cut. And we were all agreed, this cut is even better. Firstly for some reason the Romero version print was very bright but I didn't really see this as a problem until watching this version with much more defined colours and shadows. Also what strikes immediately is the soundtrack. I always thought it odd and now I consider it madness that Romero did not stick with the Goblins throughout. It makes an enormous difference to have this varied, sensitive and urgent sound helping to drive the picture forwards. The only thing I knew before about this cut was that the comedic elements had been cut and watching it immediately after the Romero version it is easy to appreciate what a difference taking these out has. Also though there is significant tightening throughout. We just don't get those scenes of the heroes sitting around, playing cards or trying to watch TV. Also there seem to be extra bits and bobs that help to clarify what is going on. Some of this may be the benefit of watching a second time anyway but for instance I thought there was something daft about the blocking of the doors only for the bikers to be able to crash through anyway but now it is clear they are using the loading bay. So, to summarise, this Argento cut, looks better, sounds better and skips the silliness whilst adding clarity where needed. Even more brilliant!",Dawn of the Dead
28,ShadeGrenade,The 'Citizen Kane' Of Zombie Movies!,10,12 September 2006,"If proof were ever needed that the 1970's was the golden age of horror movies, 'Dawn Of The Dead' is it. A decade after his groundbreaking 'Night Of The Living Dead', George A.Romero returned to zombies with this, arguably the greatest film of its kind.Low budget horror films were all the rage in those days. Strangely, the lack of money worked in their favour as film makers such as Cronenberg, DePalma, Carpenter, Lieberman and Hooper had to rely on their imaginations. Instead of big-name Hollywood stars, 'Dawn' presents us with four ordinary people - one woman and three men - struggling to survive in a nightmarish world.The documentary look lends weight to the horror, as at times you feel that what you are watching is real! Romero comes up with some stunning set pieces such as S.W.A.T. troopers invading a house full of the living dead, a zombie's head being sliced off by the rotor blades of a helicopter, and Hells Angels storming the shopping mall where our heroes are holed up. Tom Savini provided the gruesome make-up ( even Peckinpah never used so much blood! ) and appears as one of the Hells Angels. Great soundtrack by Dario Argento and The Goblins!One or two critics praised the movie at the time as an 'anti consumer society satire'. To tell the truth, I did not notice this as I was too busy cowering in terror!'Dawn Of The Dead' was a worldwide box-office hit whose success provoked dozens of imitations, mostly from Italy, such as Lucio Fulci's 'Zombi 2' ( 'Zombie Flesh Eaters' ).I liked the remake, but it relied too heavily on C.G.I. for my taste. The original leaves it standing.",Dawn of the Dead
29,Smells_Like_Cheese,I should have stuck to the remake,2,3 May 2004,"I remember seeing parts of ""Dawn of the Dead"" when I was like 4 years old. Even then, it wasn't too scary. Pretty recently, I saw the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"". I thought it was excellent and one of the best horror movies I had seen in a while. So, I thought the original had be great as well. First I checked out IMDB.com to see the rating. 7.7! I'd be stupid not to check it out. So, I made a trip to Hollywood Video.Why?! How in the heck did this get a 7.7 rating? This was a horrible movie. I mean, the make up, let's start with that.MAKE UP: Green paint on the face? Ooh. Scary. They still could blink! Aren't they supposed to be dead? And the blood? OMG, don't get me started on that ""They didn't have enough money"" routine. George could've used corn syrup! Even red dyed water would've looked more real!ACTING: My God! The actors were beyond annoying. The main actress, I can't remember her name, didn't even act scared when the zombies were attacking. She would react like once or stand there. I can name more that 5 zombies that got out of character during the film! They looked like they were drunk!
OVER ALL STORY: Now, I loved ""Night of the Living Dead"", it didn't explain too much about how the zombies rose. But this was stupid! I just didn't get how they rose or the whole beginning. !!!SPOILER!!! I didn't get why if it was the end of the world an army of motorcyle guys would want to kill people?Stick the remake or the original ""Night of the Living Dead"".

30,MovieAddict2016,A fairly good horror film with a few considerable flaws. Not one of my favorites.,5,31 March 2004,"""When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.""Sometimes movies attain cult classic stature for puzzling reasons. I've never understood the success of ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978). At least not as far as to call it one of the best horror films ever made. It's a good movie, with some fine moments, but it's poorly written and poorly directed and poorly acted. It's not masterfully crafted in any way.Sure, it has a high level of sly social commentary, but it's about as subtle as a blow to the head. The end credits, although amusing, are a sign that the director - George A. Romero - is really pushing these ideas onto us way too heavily. We got it the first time. Enough is enough.I've never thought very highly of Romero. ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) is truly one of the best horror films of all time, but it is quite adequately directed - the movie succeeds on its own, not because of its director. And Romero's ""Season of the Witch"" (1973) was proof of this - a film so bad that it defied all words. Anyone who calls him a great director needs to see that atrocious piece of cinema.Still, he has to be somewhat credited for starting the zombie craze. ""Dawn of the Dead"" was the first of these modern-day zombie movies - more brutal and graphic than its predecessor, and arguably a bit smarter. Some people call it a sequel, but essentially the film is an updated remake, filmed ten years after the first movie with a larger budget, colorized prints, Tom Savini's sometimes laughable creature effects, and so on and so forth.It picks up right after the first film, despite an unexplained ten-year gap of technology. The zombies are still attacking Pennsylvania, so a pilot, his girlfriend and two SWAT members take refuge in a local mall that is overrun by the slow-moving creatures. ""Why do they come here?"" Francine (Gaylen Ross) asks. ""Some kind of instinct. Memory, of something they used to do. This was an important place in their lives,"" David Emge tells her.I hate to break the news, but not all Americans revolve around malls - at least not anyone I know (and my relatives all live in Pennsylvania). But it's symbolism for commercialism in America, and it works, even if the theme is strongly overused.The film was criticized upon its release in 1978 for being ultra-violent and too gory. It's not. If anything, it's what Romero himself described as ""comic book violence"" - lots of (obviously) fake and over-the-top blood and gore mixed with quite silly looking zombies. The makeup is often uneven - when one of the main characters reanimates after being killed by a zombie, his face is shriveled and pale and horrifying. All the other zombies can't have such close attention paid towards them by Savini, so they often appear as if they've wandered out of a pool of gray paint.Many people consider ""Dawn of the Dead"" to be one of the finest horror films of all time. As much as I appreciate it as a whole, and as fun as it is, it's also a bit too long for a film of its genre - I gave it a chance but found myself counting many scenes that could have been cut, or at least shortened. I respect the movie, but I have a feeling that the newly-released remake may be more in the vein of my own personal tastes. Plus, the new film has fast zombies. You just can't beat fast zombies.Note: ""Dawn of the Dead"" is now available to purchase on a single disc ""Special Edition"" DVD, with commentary by Romero and special effects artist Tom Savini, radio spots, commercials, theatrical trailers, a Romero biography, a new 2004 state-of-the-art digital transfer, and more. I bought the DVD but am not overwhelmed by its features - if you're a huge fan of the movie, I suggest waiting until later this year, when the 3-disc DVD is released (presumably around the same time as the 2004 remake's DVD release date).4/5 stars.John Ulmer",Dawn of the Dead
31,Red-Barracuda,A template and intelligent horror classic,9,21 January 2015,"Director George A. Romero made his breakthrough with a pretty incredible debut feature, Night of the Living Dead. It came out in 1968 and was a no budget, ground-breaking masterpiece that completely re-imagined how the horror genre could be tackled. It brought a new intensity and realism to the genre, as well as an approach to violence that was unprecedented. Sure, there had been films before it that revelled in blood and guts, such as the output of Herschell Gordon Lewis for instance, but they tended to be almost black comedies, with little attempt at realism. Contrastingly, Romero's film played things very straight while delivering the goods. The film became an instant success, albeit more on the midnight movie run, however, a naive copyright mistake meant that Romero made no money from it. He continued making interesting low budget features throughout the 70's but it was only when internationally successful Italian director Dario Argento stepped in to provide funding that the bigger scale, more ambitious sequel to his original classic became a possibility. Dawn of the Dead was born, went on to become one of the most successful independent movies ever and spawned a cycle of zombie splatter films, while cementing most of the 'rules' of the sub-genre in the process.Despite gap between the movies, the action in Dawn immediately follows the events depicted in Night. The dead are now swarming everywhere and the United States has resorted to martial law. One particular swat team tackle a housing project infested with zombies but things get out of hand and they take off with a helicopter pilot and his TV reporter girlfriend. Before long, they find the ideal place to hide out - a large suburban shopping mall.There's no getting away from it, this is a definite classic of the horror genre. It's relatively unusual in that it has a multi-layered narrative that works on different levels. It's most famous sub-text compares the zombies with us, as they go about their business in the mall. It's this satire on consumerism, along with proper three-dimensional characters with their own realistic mini dramas, that sets Dawn apart from the vast majority of films in the zombie cannon, which generally concentrate on not much more than gory mayhem (not that there's anything wrong with that mind you). Romero is helped considerably here by the fact that his four principal actors are all very good and flesh out their characters to resemble realistic people; this really assists in generating tension, as we feel the fear more when we believe in the characters. Which leads on to the horror credentials of the film, which are covered in some style with several terrifying and suspenseful scenes. Romero takes care in pacing events in such a way to maximise this, while the visceral side of the horror is provided by the gory effects work of Tom Savini – who also appears as a biker who appears to have an endless array of weaponry on his person, like a character from a computer game! Savini's work is impressive with, amongst other things, an exploding head, a screwdriver to the brain, neck chomping and a head sliced in half by helicopter blades. All of this is provided via a narrative that is pretty muscular and action-oriented; while all of this is accentuated by the dynamic score from soundtrack legends Goblin, the bass-heavy main theme, in particular, remains the definitive musical accompaniment to all things zombie-related.I also think one of the reasons this film works so well is that it operates in a further way, in that most of us in the audience are thinking to ourselves how great it would be to actually have a shopping mall all to ourselves as our home during a zombie apocalypse and, therefore, putting ourselves in the protagonist's shoes. The film does play on this, making this place truly seem like an oasis in the midst of the hell the rest of the world has become. It takes a bit of care an attention to detail for a film-maker to make a horror movie that makes these types of aspects so important. Violent, exciting, dramatic, thought-provoking and involving – Dawn of the Dead is all these things and more.",Dawn of the Dead
32,Rainey-Dawn,Good Zombie Film,7,18 April 2015,"As far as ""zombie"" films go, Dawn of the Dead is one of the best films ever made on the creature. This particular film has what appears to be hundreds of them milling about. This film has quite a bit of excitement - plenty of shoot-them-up action.Easy to follow along film: A zombie plague has occurred, survivors are trying to find means of protecting themselves and a safe place to live. This particular group ends up in a shopping mall where there's plenty of goods to maintain them for a long while.A film of this nature is not an award winning film but as far as zombie horror flicks goes this movie is tops in it's own category.7.5/10",Dawn of the Dead
33,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Mall of the dead.,7,9 August 2019,"'Dawn Of The Dead (1978)' is a very different beast to its predecessor, despite being similarly socially-conscious; where 'Night Of The Living Dead (1968)' was about racism, this is about consumerism. It's much larger in scale yet actually quite similar in scope, placing more focus on its few characters than on the innumerable zombies they're consistently having to outmanoeuvre. Of course, plenty of attention is paid to the gruesome ways in which these foes can be dispatched, which gives the entire affair an 'exploitation' vibe. Romero's prior title utilised keen black-and-white cinematography to cleverly hide its monetary restraints, crafting an insular and almost-claustrophobic experience; this, a similarly rag-tag production, decides to splash out in as many ways as possible (mainly in the special effects department), leading to an impressive and colourful feature that is dampened by generally looking quite 'flat'. The camera-work is usually locked-off, played in favour of coverage, and the colour-palette is pretty 'made for TV'. It's a good thing, then, that what's being shown is engaging - and, filmmaking-wise, impressive - enough to make you forget about these issues. The simple story is peppered with several suspenseful set-pieces and charismatic character-moments. It slows down considerably once the now-famous mall is introduced, favouring a more natural pacing that places emphasis on survival technique. Our heroes often try to find the 'fun' in the situation, as well. When a new normalcy is established, things do start to get a little dull. Obviously, this is by design but you still feel it. Thankfully, things soon pick back up with an action-packed, gore-filled finale. It's basically more of what we've seen before but, after the short draught we've been through, it's welcome nevertheless. In general, the movie is an entertaining experience. It has a few flaws, though. The music is sometimes strangely goofy, overplaying the piece's darkly comic undertones, and there are a few scenes that are slightly over-the-top, too. Plus, the camera-work is pretty flat, the acting and dialogue are both about average and the whole thing looks ever-so-slightly 'sub-par' in a 'grind-house' sort of way. However, some of these issues are actually quite charming. Moreover, the enjoyment factor takes the edge off most of them. It helps that the flick clearly has something to say, with a solid subtext that gets more relevant as the run-time ticks on. It's a fun, occasionally tense and somewhat silly ride. There's a reason it's a cult classic. 7/10",Dawn of the Dead
34,bowmanblue,The zombie purist's classic,10,26 December 2014,"Zombies are everywhere these days and, rightly or wrongly, many consider Dawn of the Dead (1978) to be the cause of it all. It's actually a follow-up to the 1960s 'Night of the Living Dead,' but Dawn was the more successful due to its epic scale and added action (that and being in colour).If you've never seen Dawn of the Dead (1978) before, and only watched modern zombie movies, you may not get why it's so popular. The zombies here move slower than your Gran and are simply painted either slightly greener than normal or slightly bluer than normal. Plus they only really eat you if you're completely stupid. Yet, despite those flaws, the film is still a classic.For a start it's the longest of all zombie films (extended edition, anyway) and is set in a world that is slowly falling apart due to the undead outbreak. Our four heroes take refuge in a shopping mall in an attempt to wait out the dead. If you talk to any die-hard fans, they'll delight in telling you that Dawn of the Dead is an attack on a consumer society and that zombies are a metaphor for shoppers with too much cash (or something). That may be true, but, at the end of the day, that sort of talk is all a little pretentious and, ultimately, Dawn of the Dead is about zombies ripping you apart if you get too near them or don't blow their brains out quick enough.Someone once described Dawn of the Dead as 'the Gone With the Wind' of zombie movies. I can see what they mean - it's large, loud, epic and proud of itself. If you haven't already seen it, you may want to put yourself in audiences' shoes when they first saw it in 1978. Back then, an apocalyptic horror movie on this scale was pretty unheard of. Don't expect massive battles, great special effects of particularly realistic zombies (and don't expect them to run, either!). Just enjoy it for what it is - a piece of genuine cinema history.I love it, and yet I can still pick a fair few holes in the plot, characters and theme. The story kind of trundles in no direction and many motivations are left unexplained, but that's a small price to pay for a film that will - whether you like it or not - stand the test of time in the zombie genre.",Dawn of the Dead
35,Cineanalyst,Mall(ed) Zombies,8,12 April 2020,"George A. Romero's second zombie film and one of the most-celebrated entries in the subgenre, ""Dawn of the Dead"" may lose something from its higher production values and more orderly construction compared to its lower-budget predecessor, ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968), but it largely makes up for this with amusing episodes overlaying a satirical subtext on American materialism. Any other social commentary, including the odd heckling of TV guests, as though reflecting post-Vietnam and Watergate-era youth rebellion, doesn't work as well. Ditto the depiction of rural communities, followed by the biker gang, reveling in slaughtering the undead. Yet, the opening sequence in an apartment complex does well to establish the apocalyptic scenario, the picture's exploitation-style gore, and the motivation for flight from urban areas--in this case, for the suburban mall.Here, the actions of the ghouls, besides their hunger for human flesh, and including their limited tool use, is explained as behavior remembered from their past lives. Hence, the congregating of mall zombies--mindlessly shopping at the alter of materialism, continuing consumerism on the graves of the dead. Ironically, our living heroes do the same thing. Moreover, with the infectious spread of the unthinking, flesh-eating disease, the mall serves as a seemingly ideal place to quarantine oneself, which especially resonates during today's pandemic, as well as a being an upgrade from the claustrophobic country house of ""Night of the Living Dead.""The zombies in color here, including some silly makeup, don't have the same classical black-and-white horror look, in the tradition of such films as ""Frankenstein"" (1931), of its predecessor, but this is partly compensated by the added comedy. The blood-pressure scene is especially funny, but there's also amusement to be had merely in viewing the characters going on a shopping spree and making a home among department stores. Although the slow-moving, inarticulate, mindless and not-especially-strong zombies hardly seem much of a threat, either, ""Dawn of the Dead"" does well to demonstrate how the follies of humanity and people's reckless behavior exacerbates the epidemic and puts lives at risk. The allure of shopping and socializing is also true for the infected and otherwise dangerous. Fun itself and to be surrounded by others is a risk. Nowadays, especially, it's a frightening picture of both the destruction and continuation of society.",Dawn of the Dead
36,ericstevenson,My new favorite horror movie!,10,9 August 2016,"I am generally not a fan of horror movies, but I really do make exceptions for zombie films. I absolutely adore them and think they're wonderfully creative. I used to say that ""Night Of The Living Dead"" was my favorite horror movie and it would obviously be a tough act to follow. They did in fact top it with one of the best movies I've seen in my life! The first one was great because of the psychological horrors the characters went through and this manages to make it even better. It's not so much a horror movie as more of an action movie with pretty funny scenes and even great drama with characters I truly care about. It really is the horror movie for everybody.I remember watching the final scene and thinking that it could only get better if the last guy lived and decided not to commit suicide...and he did! It's certainly a much happier ending than the previous movie. It was great to see how ten years of special effects have improved the series. This really doesn't have much connection to ""Night Of The Living Dead"", probably because that movie killed off every main character! Instead, they give us a much nicer ending which really did work out better, if it was bittersweet. What's great about this movie is that there are so many scenes where the characters are just having fun.Seriously, there's a point where this whole zombie thing just becomes casual for them. They even manage to find a nice lifestyle in the mall they hang out in. It's great to change the location because we get a whole lot more room for the characters and us viewers to explore. It still manages to get that feeling of an enclosed space, only bigger. It's great to see the different ways the zombies die. It's hard to tell if we're supposed to feel sympathetic to them. It's like the bikers are the only truly evil people. Then again, they do help get rid of a lot of them, but there's always more. The fact that this movie is so unwilling to take sides is what makes it a classic.This is one of the best depiction of zombies I've ever seen. There's only a few subtle references to the original movie, but that's fine. It's great to see the mythology of something being expanded so much. There were even some interesting thoughts on racism here. It seemed to wander around for the first 15 minutes, but even those parts were great! A lot of us know what it's like to want to be alone in any scenario. Loved the dialogue, loved the music, loved the action, just loved everything! ****",Dawn of the Dead
37,CuriosityKilledShawn,"An Epic, no doubt",10,13 June 2004,"George A. Romero's HUGE-scale sequel to Night of the Living Dead takes his simple, but scary, idea and expands from an isolated farmhouse to the whole planet. The zombies are EVERYWHERE and there is no escape. Resistance is futile. A couple of SWAT team members quickly figure this out and skip on their evacuation duties to just get out of the city in their own quicker way. Hooking up with a couple of traffic reporters in a chopper they take off in search of a safe haven. Along the way they see the world below react to the oncoming Armageddon and end of civilization.After spotting a deserted shopping mall below the quartet land on the roof and barricade themselves inside as the world very quickly crumbles. Hope is rapidly running out and much time passes with no word from what remains of the world.While not as scary as the remake, this film does make up by having a sick sense of humor and a larger story to tell. I won't pass off cheeky subtext as my own discovery (every other review here does) but it is quite intelligent (if a bit dated in the present day). There's a lot of depth to Dawn of the Dead and it's all well thought out and planned rather than being generic and unoriginal like so many other modern horror movies.There characters (especially Ken Foree) are all strong and believable and react with logic and sense rather than annoying panic. It's interesting to see how normal people take on facing the end of civilization (if not the end of the world...just humans) with just simple tools and the bare minimum at their reach.The opinions over the original and remake are pretty much split. I think that both are very strong efforts at true horror and instead of regarding them as original/remake I think it's wiser to consider them as two separate stories both happening at the same time.Each film has their weaknesses and strengths. The zombies in the original are a bit too comical to be truly threatening. While in the remake they'd be on you, ripping your throat out before you can even say 'What the..?' And the actual 'DAWN' of the dead was more emphasized in the remake. Though the original has more of a true epic feel to it.Currently, the 156 minute director's cut of the original is only available in an OOP DVD from Anchor Bay. But if you hold off until September then a massive box set from AB feature 3 different cuts of the film and loads of extras will be released.This is definitely a horror classic, far above Psycho and Silence of the Lambs. True greatness. Keep a lookout for Jason make-up man Tom Savini as Blades and remember Ken Foree's chilling prophecy...'When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth'",Dawn of the Dead
38,ironhorse_iv,"When there's no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the earth and I'll watch it. Movie was fun to watch.",7,6 May 2015,"When there's no room in hell, the dead will walk the malls. This movie gives new meaning to the phrase, 'Shop until you drop'. Directed by George A. Romero, Dawn of the Dead also known as Zombi tells the story of a group of human survivors that barricade themselves inside a suburban shopping mall from a zombie outbreak. It's the second film made in Romero's Living Dead series, but contains no characters or settings from the original 1968's Night of the Living Dead. Instead, it shows new characters in a larger scale, post-apocalyptic society, ten years later the first attack. The movie follows the same tropes of the first movie, but it kinda introduce some new ones. This is probably the first movie to coin, the modern meaning of Zombie. It also, never mention the word, again, like most zombies films. George A. Romero indeed reinvention the myth of zombie, from magically curse-undead beings to flesh-eating living viruses. It's really surprising, how many modern zombies movies and TV-shows still follow the same old format that George A. Romero launch in his first two zombies movies. At the time, the make-up, action and gore effects were pretty alright, but this movie hasn't aged, well. The slow zombie was just downright too sluggish to be taken as a serious threat and the make-up work is questionable, at times. They look more like drunk blue smurfs, due to the lighting turning the grey make up, blue. Throughout the film, the zombies are handled almost effortlessly; the only danger to humans come when the living acts stupid or careless. There is barely any tense moments. The movie doesn't feel like a straight up horror film. It acts more like a silly satire action comedy. It's somewhat, works. The movie become more fun to watch, but it's also draws criticize, for being a bit corny and over the top. The scene where the bikers threw pies in their faces, kinda kill it for me. Being a fan of the first film, I found this movie to be, less of a thrill. I was hoping for more, scarier faster uglier scar, rage zombies. I'm glad, that rage zombies proved so popular that they wound up in sequels of George Romero's later Dead films, because these zombies are a joke. Another issue of the film is how the undead imitated once-human behavior, all of which annoyed most Dead purists. Despite that, the movie does have some memorable zombies. Since the movie has a small amounts of zombie extras, they became very noticeable, such as the Hare Krishna Zombie, the Nun Zombie, and so on. My favorites is the zombie who grabbed an assault rifle, and the Nurse zombie. Still, it's a bit jarring, to find them, both inside and outside the mall, at the same time. One thing, that I love, about this film is the characters. Scott H. Reiniger as Roger, reminds me a young Jack Nicholson with his high energy and charisma. It really sucks, that he wasn't in the film, longer. At first, I didn't like the character of Francine (Gaylen Ross). She was very useless, b*tchy and annoying, but by the end of the film, she kinda grew on me, and became somewhat likable. Much of this female development, could be credited by actress Gaylen Ross, who refused to play a weak character. I just wish, the writers use, the pregnant angle more, than a throw-away mention. Traffic helicopter reporter Stephen a.k.a. Flyboy (David Emge) was alright in his role. I just wish, he stood out, more, than awful shooter and a secondary character. By far, Peter (Ken Foree) is the number 1 badass in this film. I glad to see an African-American actor in a main role. It was very rare in these days. I like, how the movie gives all of them, some character depth. We really see them, grow as realistic survivors. Monroeville Mall was a great location to shot. All filming inside the mall took place at night after the mall had closed, with filming often continuing until dawn. The movie has this somewhat preachy social commentary about mindless consumer culture that speaks truth to me, but also speaks annoying, due to the fact, that it's not well-delivered. The movie is a little too straight forward with its anti-consumerism message. I wish, they smarten hint at it, rather than put it all out there. We get it, materialism offers no raison d'être for human survival. Dawn has this decidedly bleak, almost nihilistic worldview when it comes to capitalism, but I find the film a bit, contradicting, due to the fact, that this movie was made for entertaining value, rather than a realistic-survival manual. Romero did not want to cut the violence and gore from the film, but he was adamant against an X rating, due to its stigma of hard-core pornography. In the end, Romero was able to persuade his distributors to release the film with no rating, but cuts did had to be made. This movie has three different cuts versions: Extended cut, Dario Argento's European cut and the theatrical cut. Extended Cut brings all the delete scenes back into the film, making this version of the film feels a little darker. Argento's version is the shortest, but the movie pacing is a lot better. All of them, have Goblin's awesome score; but some of them, have more than others. Without spoiling it, the movie tragic ending was also change, to be more uplifting. This movie is followed by 1985's Day of the Dead, and loosely remade in 2004 with James Gunn & Zack Snyder with a scarier tone. Overall: Despite its faults, this movie is indeed entertaining.

40,poe426,Ushered in the Age of Splatter...,10,15 January 2002,"It was obvious, from the tense opening scenes, that George Romero had returned to his frightening forte. Like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD before it, DAWN OF THE DEAD delivered. Critics (who are fond of explaining what, exactly, the filmmaker meant when he made the movie) found the ""social subtext"" of the film fascinating. Never mind the gut-wrenching horror, the edge-of-your-seat suspense: the movie, we were told, was functioning on ""many levels."" Had nothing much to do with rousing action or great Goblin music or Tom Savini's in-your-face fx; no, it was the cultural iconography that caused critics to sit bolt upright and start taking notes. It's a bit overlong, but who's going to tell the man who redefined the horror film to excise frames? Not I. I must've gone back to see this one a dozen times at midnight screenings (this was back before the Betamax). I go back and watch it on video tape, from time to time, and it still holds up as an entertaining fright film- but, seeing it up on the big screen, when it first premiered in this country, was an experience the small screen can't convey (not even a ""big screen"" tv). When it comes to some films, size DOES matter...",Dawn of the Dead
41,johnnyboyz,"The sort of well made, grungy horror film which is able to enjoy itself but can also deliver the sort of terrifying experience one rarely sees anymore.",7,23 May 2013,"I suppose it is the absurdity of the situation behind Dawn of the Dead that makes it so infectious; so enjoyable; so endearing. There's something quite amusing behind witnessing a handful of people scoot around an indoor mall in a Volkswagen automobile picking off various incarnations of the un-dead as they strive, absolutely terrified in the meantime, to try and survive beyond the next hour in a world which is already subsiding to the swathes of Hell. The director, George A. Romero, had already produced a low-level, low budgeted horror film in the 60's entitled ""Night of the Living Dead"" - a seminal piece that happened to be able to take its place amongst the greats of the genre. Now, a sequel which comes close to being just as good allows for scenes whereby its characters hang out of the back of the boots of showroom cars as they hare past interior fountains staving off a zombie threat to a chorus of upbeat synthetic music that's entirely self-aware of the ridiculousness of the situation. This certainly never happened in something like Whale's Frankenstein...As before, Romero's film depicts a handful of disparate people with the room to become desperate; a mixture of blacks and whites, women and men. In fact, most of what worked in ""Night"" is present here again: the spending of the immediate opening with a character or characters whom do not come to adopt the role of the leads; the empowered Negro, whose actions come to save everybody lest they be dead long ago, and that of people stuck in a singular location as, around them, the dead rise and the authorities try frantically to both work out just what's going on as well as how to try stop it. Starting in a chaotic television studio, a broadcast is going out featuring two people arguing over the severity of the situation as those backstage seem to vie with one another over their own problems. One man has a plan; he is Stephen (Emge) and his girlfriend co-worker Francine (Ross) are set to fly out of there in a news chopper owned by a station engulfed in confusion as the emergency broadcasting system takes over and the transition of change seems apparent. Not so far away is that of a police commando unit hitting an apartment block run by a Hispanic gang. At the forefront of this is a law enforcing commando Roger (Reiniger), a hard enough guy not to react upon witnessing one of his own having their brains blown out during a firefight but moral enough to hold his fire on an unarmed gang member before grimacing when they meet a torrent of police bullets head on anyway. Sharp in combat with that of whom will eventually become his good friend in Peter (Foree), an African American and fellow special weapons and tactics commando, they uncover things in the block more sordid than first envisaged when cannibalism and such is unfolding. In terms of protagonists synonymous with a genre film, both of these embody each of the traits required for your more standardised lead. As decades have past, and the horror genre has been fused more and more with that of the action genre, particularly when reaching as far as zombie sub-genre films, this sort of incarnation wouldn't be unfamiliar driving a piece akin to Dawn of the Dead. But Romero resists playing it easily; his deconstruction of this archetype, as someone who is hot-headed, a bit brash and ultimately pathetic, is appealing – Dawn of the Dead's influence on films and film-makers since has often been apparent in whatever work they've produced, but so too has their lack of understanding in this regard. Stephen and Francine's news chopper eventually comes to pick up both Roger and Peter, and they fly across dozens of people who would ordinarily act as the required help if it wasn't for the fact they possess a helicopter everybody else might crave. An apparent salvation arrives with the finding of a shopping centre, something they board up as their own and strive to defend. The shopping centre is a place of such apparent normality and everyday-ness that its very presence is a sickening juxtaposition of cheesy music and tacky stores with the apocalypse unfolding outside. Its colour scheme, with its bright and 'invisible' white lighting tone, clashes with the gore-tastic reds and pinks of blood and innards brought about by some of the more violent scenes in the film. What is pleasant about the film is its real lack of aspiration to depict the saving of the world. There are no meek narrative arcs here wherein quests to rid the planet of the un-dead take centre stage; there doesn't appear to be a solution, no conspiracy theory to investigate before delivering a few fatal blows in a meek final act resulting in a new order. Rather, Romero depicts survival; he depicts people who have already been established as being useless in combat (Francine's 'choke' with a hammer and Stephen's poor shooting) thrust into a situation wherein abilities in combat is a necessity. He depicts people with nowhere to go and nothing to do but live long enough to tell people that they strove to survive, a film relying on the simple things to deliver affecting results. At a time when mainstream, English-language American horror films think they're delivering scares; think their telling stories and assume themselves to be quite clever, Dawn of the Dead is a welcome reminder of just how good horror can be with old-fashioned effects and European film making sensibilities.",Dawn of the Dead

45,insomniac_rod,"No exactly a masterpiece, but a very influential, excellent produced Horror movie.",8,5 August 2006,"Believe the hype but with caution. ""Dawn Of The Dead"" is a great Horror movie, possibly the second best from the Zombie sub-genre, and it has influenced many Horror movies (it even got a re-make). Still, the movie has it's cheesy aspects (as many 70's Horror) and at some points you wonder if the pointless scenes fit with the movie. This is an excellent movie in all the sense of the word but it's not a masterpiece, in my opinion. Masterpiece is a movie that changes the vision of the world overall or in this case, to the Horror audience. A masterpiece can turn an underground, lesser known movie to a popular movie. ""Dawn"" is surely popular but many people who claim that this is the 8th wonder of the world have contributed to it's not deserved overrated status.I watched this movie years ago and I truly didn't appreciate it; I watched it just as a ""must see"" as I started my ""carreer"" in the genre. After several viewings I came with the conclusion that this is one of the best Horror movies ever made for many reasons. First, and mainly because of the basics... it's shocking, emotive, gory, tense, and suspenseful. It works as a straight Horror movie. But ""Dawn"" is more than just a Horror movie. It has a great amount of Action and Drama from the point of view of Sociology. Some scenes in the movie are a criticism to modern society (in 1978). The social message is not as strong as in ""Day Of The Dead"" or in ""Land Of The Dead"" because ""Dawn"" focuses more on the Action sequences. Still, this movie has a lot to dig from. The movie starts in an intense manner with the shooting between the commando and the rebels. The sequence has great gore and ends with a truly moving scene where the zombie family members or once habitants of the building are hidden in a dark room and massacred by the commando. Then the movie centers on the four main characters and that's where the real plot starts getting shape. Then the movie becomes slow but with important information. The slowness helps for the character development and makes you care for them. The connection between the main characters is almost magical; it seems as they have been working for years.The movie , by that point, has the audience ""hooked"" and thats' when the REAL action begins. Surely, the whole gang situation was pointless in my opinion because it truly didn't add anything but good gore and violence. Other thing would be if one of the gang members (say, Savini) survived and helped our heroes against the zombies. Still, the scene is one of the most popular moments of the movie. And as I said, it features great gore. The action isn't non stop as many scenes involving some cheesiness (like the characters ""stealing"" articles from different stores) happen in between. When the movie reaches a macabre, violent status, it's where the action is non-stop. We get the famous zombie killing, the gang members getting dismembered, and the tense ending where Peter demonstrates why he's one of the most popular bad asses in zombie cinema history. The acting is truly great. David Emge (Stephen) delivers a chameleonic performance. First, he starts as the good guy with good intentions but with an attitude. By the time he gets killed he is truly a hero. Scott H. Reiniger (Roger) delivers also a solid performance for a weak characters that ends up being a warrior. I liked his acting. Gaylen Ross (Francine) portrays perfectly an unconventional heroine. She never screams or gets scared by the most gruesome situations. She was very attractive by the way. I left Ken Foree (Peter) at the end because he deserves special mention. He's a solid, brave actor who portrays the though guy of the movie who alone, could beat the zombies. His character is a bad ass but also an excellent friend/human overall. The direction couldn't be better. The settings are beautiful but unsettling at the same time. There isn't a single moment where you can say that there's complete peace. This is truly a disturbing movie in all the sense of the word. Thanks to Romero's visually stunning (but dark) direction, this is a movie that won't age. The gore is beautiful but sometimes looks very cartoonish. Romero intended it to be comic book looking. Even that it looks cartoonish, it fits with the movie's comic book plot and sequences (shootings, action, dialogs, etc.). The score is just perfect. The macabre sounds mixed perfectly with ""normal"" music for the settings is truly great. There isn't much to comment about this aspect anyways.",Dawn of the Dead
46,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Somehow it manages to be as iconic as the original,8,1 April 2012,"It's rather striking how much ""Dawn of the Dead"" feels like its own original film. Maybe its the move from black and white to color or the complete change in main characters, but outside of that, it's entirely the same concept.George A. Romero has made ""Dawn of the Dead"" true to its predecessor in its strengths and its flaws. Both, for example, are extremely boring in stretches, yet both make statements about human nature still rare in even today's horror films.Taking place right after ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Dawn"" follows two Philadelphia SWAT team officers, a traffic helicopter pilot and his TV producer girlfriend as they seek refuge in an area shopping mall.I've seen tons of zombie films or survival films made since this one, yet the characters in ""Dawn"" seem less like stereotypes. We're not made to hate any one character or get squarely behind any one character. They all have their faults and you want to scream at all of them at some point not to do something. Stephen (David Emge), for example, can't fire a weapon properly or accurately, yet insists on being a hero. Watching him fire a pistol in a boiler room where the bullet could ricochet and wound or kill him is excruciating, especially because he's trying to kill just one zombie. His girlfriend Franny (Gaylen Ross) simply gets paralyzed with fear on countless occasions. It's not screaming, so maybe that's good, but in horror movies we look for the realization of fear in order to connect to the characters.Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) are at least a fun to watch. Foree is intense, smart and someone you don't want to mess with and Roger is just a plucky goofball. Considering how much time you have to spend with these guys, you do need to like them in some sense for the film to work.""Night of the Living Dead"" was more of an intimate study in human nature, whereas ""Dawn"" widens the scope and looks more at how we might respond in the wake of a cataclysmic event. The debate raging between the folks shown on TV puts the action we see in the mall in context. All the campy, gory mayhem hasn't the slightest twinge of philosophical thinking, but as the film progresses, the TV debates put those ideas in the back of our minds.At the same time, ""Dawn"" is clearly intended to be more of a satire and even a screwball comedy. Romero shows countless shots of contextual footage featuring gray makeup-clad zombies wandering stupidly and aimlessly up the escalator or just walking around period. It's not scary at all; in fact, it comes off as a joke. It makes you really wonder Romero's intent for much of the film—until the biker gang comes in the picture. At that point we're looking at ourselves as human beings with shocking disdain. It becomes no longer a survival film but a tragedy of sorts. After a rather tedious majority of the film, this is when ""Dawn of the Dead"" becomes a classic for more than just turning a shopping mall into an iconic image of horror cinema. Somehow, with the same thunderbolt, Romero makes lightning strike twice.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out more at moviemusereviews.com",Dawn of the Dead

48,Anonymous_Maxine,And color is off to a stumbling start.,3,4 April 2004,"Color had been around for decades when this film was made in the late 1970s, which makes it even more surprising to me to see that the horror effects were so badly done here, and mostly because of the fact that the film was done in color. I shudder to think what the zombies in The Night of the Living Dead would have looked like had the film been done in color, but they were effective largely because of their relentless, monotonous advance and because their make-up was so simple. And, I have a feeling, because you really couldn't see it all that well. As a result, they were recognizable more because of how they moved than because of how dead they looked. In fact, it was only when there were closer shots of their faces that they looked fake.Now, ten years after that movie, George Romero once again takes the helm of this dark story to show some more of the aftermath of some catastrophe the details of which we are never given. Unfortunately, now the film stock is clearer and in color, there are more zombies, and evidently Romero couldn't resist what was maybe the popular demand to get a better look at these creatures. Unfortunately, as it turns out, the make-up was good from far but far from good. Closer inspection reveals the zombies to be nothing but massive amounts of extras in blue-face make-up. Not a single one of them actually looks dead, the make-up is just too cheap and too carelessly applied. In many shots, the cheesy, bright-blue make-up on the faces has not been applied to the actors' ears, so they end up looking like kids who's mothers have hurriedly applied Halloween make-up for a night of trick-or-treating. At this point, it's not hard to see why this was the installment in the trilogy that was remade recently. The original had already been colorized in 1990, but this is the one that clearly has the most room for improvement.The acting, unfortunately, is terrible as well. This is also true of the original, to a lesser extent, but then this movie displays that curious quality of bad horror movies, where the actors display inexplicably bizarre behavior, for any of a number of reasons. Many times, the actors act weird because they have to somehow appear to credibly not realize something completely obvious that would save their life, or because they have to look like they're not thinking clearly enough to run out of the haunted house rather than up the stairs. In other cases, they act weird because the audience is not supposed to know right away if they are temporarily insane because of the stress of their situation or because they really are a bad guy/ghost/demon/vampire/zombie/etc.Here, however, at least one character's behavior makes no sense at all. The skinny white guy, whose name I can't remember and don't care to research, seems to be having a blast despite the vast destruction of the human race and their impending arrival to consume him and the rest of the few remaining survivors. As he and the lead character run out of the mall to get some trucks (the use of which is so vaguely explained that it must have been another reason to remake the movie, so the audience knows what the hell they're doing out there), this guy is hooting and hollering like some drunken frat boy, even while he's laying upside down looking under the dashboard of one of the trucks while he attempts to hotwire it while his legs dangle from the wide-open door of the truck.Why is he so excited? Why would he yell so much like that? Is he trying to make sure that he would not hear any of the hundreds of zombies in the parking lot if they approached the truck and tried to take a few bites out of his dangling legs? Is that supposed to create some sort of dramatic tension? To make the audience squirm because this guy's not paying attention to the zombies? Maybe it was just me, but anyone who acts that stupid in a horror film (not that he knows he's in a horror movie, but he clearly can not be expected to have temporarily forgotten that the human race has been turned into cannibalistic zombies) deserves to be killed. It's not dramatic tension when you WANT to see one of the characters killed off.And then you have the biker gang, another element of the movie in desperate need of revision. It seems that the whole of the human race has been decimated by whatever it is that turns people into zombies, staggering around like viruses latching on to anyone still alive and turning them into one of them, and yet these people see that there are some live ones in this mall fighting for their survival, and can think of nothing better to do than try to rush in and take over the mall, gleefully killing what might be 50% of the remaining human race in the process. This, I have decided, must be a knock against biker gangs, since the people in this group are caricatures of real people and arrive here as antagonists in a movie populated by the walking dead. There's a lot to be said about a group of people that manage to be antagonistic when our protagonists are already fighting walking masses of dead people who are trying to catch and eat them.The movie's dry humor, common and often necessary in horror films, is focused on commenting on society's enslavement by commerciality, specifically by the innate need to shop, which is not distinguished as a male or female weakness, but one of society as a whole. The walking dead are given as the reason for flocking to the mall where the cast is hiding the fact that the mall has become sort of a natural place to seek out, as though it provides some sort of existential nourishment. People are so used to going to the mall that they even flock there after they have been attacked by the walking dead and reduced to nothing more than walking zombies operating only on the primal instincts to feed and, apparently, shop.This movie is more a curiosity piece than anything else by now, since horror films have evolved so much (and, like humans, not necessarily all in good ways) and also because the movie has been remade into such a vastly superior modernization. Unfortunately, it is an example of how a simple but great horror film can be enlarged and upgraded into a spectacular failure, losing sight of all of the things that made its predecessor such a success. Strange how long ago that must have been realized, and how little has been learned by the movie industry even today.",Dawn of the Dead
49,southdavid,Marilyn Monroeville,8,20 April 2021,"When people ask me what my favourite film is, for years my stock answer has been ""the original Dawn of the Dead, I like the remake, but the original is my favourite"". Despite that sentiment, I haven't actually watched the film in a long time, certainly the last decade. So, as part of the preparation for Zack Snyders ""Army of The Dead"" our run through of the other films loosely in that series gave me the rewatching opportunity I was looking for.Two SWAT team members, Stephen (David Emge) and Peter (Ken Foree) along with Stephen's friend Roger (Scott Reiniger) and his girlfriend Francine (Gaylen Ross) escape Philadelphia in a helicopter, as the city falls to an overwhelming Zombie outbreak. They land sporadically, for increasingly dangerous fuel raids, before spotting a shopping mall and landing on the roof. Though initially just another pitstop, the group decide to stay, clear the Mall and shore up the defences, releasing that the shops have everything they need. But their life of abundance, leads to frustration, boredom and a realisation that though they are surviving, much of the rest of the planet has not been as lucky.My feeling now is that, although I still really like the film, I shouldn't perhaps keep it on my mental list of favourites. As with ""Night of the Living Dead"" it again has much to do with watching it though the eyes of another person, and seeing the flaws as someone less invested would. The performances are, again, pretty bad. Ken Foree has his moments, but the rest aren't particularly strong, as resulted in the fact that they didn't go on to work in front of a camera anything like as often as he did. The visual effects are a big step up from ""Night"" but still have a low budget ethos to them, there are some impressive gore moments from Savini though. The stunts and fight scenes are, at times, genuinely pathetic.But. I love the scope of it, the widening of the disaster to give a genuine impression that the world has fallen. I like the critique of capitalism in why the Zombie still come to the mall, and how all the possessions you could ever need don't lead to happiness in a world of isolation. I do like the story, even though I'd bow to criticism that argued that it's too long. My favourite aspect is the score, the incidental music as much as the Dario Argento's music and I often listen to that in isolation.Though it's another one that's not as good as it was in my head, ""Dawn of The Dead"" is still the pinnacle of Zombie movies and a must see for any horror movie fan.",Dawn of the Dead
50,jzappa,The Masterpiece of Zombie Cinema,9,1 October 2006,"Dawn of the Dead is surely the greatest of all zombie films. As a sequel to Night of the Living Dead, it delivers with such a stunningly different approach. Night was a more claustrophobic Halloween-time flick, and Dawn is full-tilt 1970s radiance. It is a true epic where Romero plays with his vastly increased budget, giving the cinematography blown-out, extreme colors, using Dario Argento's Goblin underscoring, and showcasing bigger guns, sets, and make-up effects. Its beginning is one of the best and most arresting beginnings to a movie that I've ever seen. Dawn of the Dead just starts, immediately, and we are promptly given its sense of apocalyptic panic, its large scale of magnitude, and its pulsing rhythm.George Romero, while hardly one for delivering in the scary department, is a true visionary. Night of the Living Dead was very progressive and incredibly imaginative in its own ways. Dawn of the Dead is a grandiose film with brilliant, captivating ideas. The way it constantly develops into more than what's expected is inspired. For instance, in 1978, it was a great, novel idea to have characters seek refuge from zombies in an abandoned shopping mall, but to show the stages in which their life progresses in that situation, from discovering its hideaways and retreats to simulating normal life inside of it by utilizing the items in all of the stores, is just so much fun.Most zombie films are all about the human feast of the zombies, the zombies' demise at the hands of the strongest human will, and it's all a splash of gore. That can be fun, forgettable popcorn entertainment. But this original Dawn of the Dead is a truly brilliant movie from the father of the genre. Its gushing of blood, guts, gore, bodily fluids of all kinds, and human- to-zombie sharpshooting is all gracefully set against the character-driven, cutting-edge, unconventional story.See the original Dawn of the Dead. It is truly several scores of heads above the remake, or most any other zombie films.",Dawn of the Dead
51,Vartiainen,We are the fear,8,7 February 2017,"The zombie apocalypse has started and our story follows a small group of survivors as they flee towards safety, having to fend for themselves in the midst of the walking dead. Their flight leads them to an overrun mall, which they realize would make for a handy fortress if they can empty it from the walkers.This original version is was directed by George A. Romero, who was also behind Night of the Living Dead. Having two of the biggest and most influential zombie movies ever made to your name is nothing to be sneezed at, and Romero certainly has a style of his own and many of the clichés still used to this day have their origins in these movies. Romero's zombies are slow, rotting and only threatening in their sheer numbers and in their relentlessness. They're a force of nature. They can be avoided with human ingenuity, but they're always there, and they will never go away. And even these early movies contain the essential truth of any good zombie movie. That the other survivors are the true threat.Also, comparing this movie to the 2004 remake of the same name, it's interesting to see what was changed. The essential setup is the same, as is the closing climax, to a certain extent. But whereas the remake has heaps and heaps of characters, simply to provide the film with cannon fodder and zombie chow, Romero's cast is only four characters strong. As thus we get to learn a lot more about them throughout the course of the film. They all start with clear, identifiable personalities, but they also grow as the story progresses. We learn more about them and they also change due to the events they have to endure. And between these two films, less is definitely more.This movie is heavily recommended for all fans of the horror. It still holds up as a great story and a true zombie horror masterpiece.",Dawn of the Dead

We meet helicopter pilot, Stephen (Emge) and his pregnant girlfriend, Francine (Ross) who works for a TV station. They unite with 2 Swat team members, Peter (Foree) and Roger (Reiniger) and head to an abandoned shopping mall where they buy their necessities and treats to survive while trying to fight off zombies. This is one of the best zombie films that much like it's predecessor, paved the way for zombie flicks, video games & the TV series, ""The Walking Dead."" It has some goofy moments and I like how the main characters taunt the zombies and run past them. Tom Savini (Friday the 13th & Creepshow) also does great as usual with the make-up which marks his debut and he also appears as motorcycle gang member, Blades. I recommend this for your horror collection.",Dawn of the Dead

It's supposed to be fun, but funny at the same time. It's supposed to have an element of suspense, but only just, often relieved by some out of place comedic element and then BAM! you've been punked by some horror element while you're enjoying your laugh.Dawn is the epitome of what Romero intended all along for his franchise. It is a horror comic on film, and one of the more enjoyable of this line. Also I must herein state that I cannot choose between this original work and the remake.

The local authorities have failed to contain the problem. Many people also still hold on to the belief that there's respect for the dead.

He followed up ten years later with Dawn of the Dead and $500,000, which allowed him better sets; mostly a shopping mall in Pittsburgh, and color film for all the blood and gore. Oh my, what a difference ten years and $400,000 makes. Again, an unknown virus causes the dead to rise seeking the flesh of the living.. SWAT teams and the US military battle the undead, and two of the SWAT guys, Roger and Peter, hijack a traffic helicopter with Stephen and Francine, who work at the local TV station. They land at a large mall to hide out at. Once inside, they argue with others as to staying inside or leaving. A motorcycle gang breaks into the mall to loot it. The zombies follow them inside, and all hell breaks loose. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Francine is four months pregnant, and so, she is taught how to fly the chopper. As the carnage continues, she must try to escape to the roof to escape with her unborn baby. Will she make it? You will have to watch this bloody massacre for over two hours to find out.

56,freemantle_uk,Classic Zombie Movie,10,16 July 2009,"George A. Romero is a master of horror direction and the Living Dead Series is properly the best horror series going, made with love, intelligence and commitment, not cheap cash-ins. The Night of the Living Dead was a horror cult-classic, made for peanuts. With Dawn of the Dead, made 10 years after the original has a bigger budget and a wider scope to the first film.The Zombie apocalypse is in full swing and society is about to break down. TV stations are going off-air and the emergency network is going into play. The American Government has drafted in the army and SWAT teams, as well as local auxiliary forces, but zombies are starting dominate the cities and rural areas. Scientists tell civilians to stop zombies then need to destroy the brain or cut off the head, which is met with shock. The main forces of the film are on four characters, Francine (Gaylen Ross) and her boyfriend Stephen (David Emge), two television station employees and SWAT members Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) and Peter (Ken Foree). Francine is a station manager who tries to report the confusing events and sets out to flee Philadelphia. Roger and Peter are in the more unsavoury areas of the city, trying to enforce martial law and meet violence resistance. After all four see the shocking events the four meet up and flee the city. They hide out in a out-of-town shopping mall to avoid the Zombies.What makes George A. Romero and the Living Dead series a cut above the rest is Romero's social and political messages. In Night of the Living Dead it had a clear message about the Civil Rights Movement and was revolutionary for the time because it had a black man as the hero. Dawn of the Dead's message is about consumerism, a dark joke about people mindlessly going to the shopping malls. They are also themes about the government reaction, the collapse of society, racism in the police and social commentary about people unwilling to kill their relatives. Dawn of the Dead is brutally violence, which is the norm in most horror films and highly intelligence compared to other films in the genre. It may not be as scary as it use to be, but it is still a hell of a watch. Romero has a wonderful use of music and sound to add to the atmosphere of the film.Romero sets out to give you characters you can care about compared to modern horror where you just want everyone to die.An aspect I really liked about the film is the post-apocalyptical world that is set up, the break down of society and the slow decline of the media for information.Some of the acting isn't great, but Dawn of the Dead wasn't aiming to win Oscars and the make-up and special effects and make-up is nothing compared to today, but what do you expect from a low-budget 70s film.Dawn of the Dead is essential watching for horror fans.",Dawn of the Dead

They really are.And, of course, these were exactly the sort of idiotic zombies who were featured here in 1978's Dawn Of The Dead. I mean, let's face it - If you can literally knock a zombie down (who's right in your face) with just a light, limp-wristed tap, then, how the hell could director George Romero ever expect to instill any semblance of genuine terror into the viewer with this total wimp-of-a-movie? And, on top of my above complaint - Not only was Dawn Of The Dead boring, predictable and way too long at 2 hours and 10 minutes - But it also featured some really terrible soundtrack music, and plenty of annoyingly pathetic acting, as well.I personally think that Dawn Of The Dead is the sort of sub-par horror movie that could only be appreciated by the most die-hard fans of the zombie genre, and no one else.",Dawn of the Dead

I mean, Tom Savini shows up in a couple of roles, and he's also a stunt man in addition to his FX work. So yeah, they found ways to save bucks. As for the plot, it's beguilingly simple: four people, trying to escape a zombie apocalypse, hole up at a shopping mall. Great place to hole up - like the mall in The Blues Brothers, this mall's got everything! Even weapons! I appreciated the relatively minimalist dialog and storyline and the heavy-duty action, particularly anything involving those mindless hordes of consumers, er, zombies.

59,dee.reid,"""Dawn of the Dead"" - One of the greatest horror movies ever?",10,18 March 2004,"Well, judging from the mass popularity surrounding George A. Romero's 1978 horror epic, ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and my own personal liking of this masterpiece, I have to honestly say yes. As I sit here writing this review on the eve of the release of the 2004 update of Romero's classic, I can only reflect on the first time I viewed it, which was only a few weeks ago. ""DOTD"" is the second film in Romero's ""Living Dead"" trilogy which started with ""Night of the Living Dead"" in 1968 (I saw a long time ago), and concluded with 1985's ""Day of the Dead"" (I have not seen). ""DOTD"" takes place a few weeks (or months? I forget) after the events of the first film, which features two S.W.A.T. team officers, a reporter and her boyfriend who manage to barricade themselves in a secluded shopping mall from the hordes of hungry zombies that run rampant outside.I am not a huge fan of horror movies (particularly zombie flicks) but a few stand apart from the others and ""DOTD"" is one of the exceptions -- a horror movie with respect for the intelligence of its audience and social subtext that is ever so cleverly planted inside the flesh-eating -- both of which give it a mass appeal. The four survivors live like fat rats inside the massive shopping center, giving into consumerism while keeping the hording masses at bay. ***MINOR SPOILER AHEAD***I was very surprised by ""DOTD,"" especially in the amount of thought that went into its story and characters. I connected with each and every one of them and it saddened me that two members of the party don't make it in the end.***END SPOILER***Another thing would be all of the subtle qualities that give this film more of an action movie feel much rather than an actual horror film. We get guns, chases, and lots of shots of zombies being mercilessly slaughtered by gunfire - all of which make it an excellent action experience. There's even a little bit of comedy thrown into the mix, with a rather manic cameo performance by special effects wizard Tom Savini as a sadistic biker.I'm positive that those are some of the main reasons that this film is so popular.P.S.: No doubt when watching ""DOTD"" that the gorehounds will almost certainly get their fair share of blood and guts (watch out for that helicopter blade, and that exploding head, or did anyone see those huge chunks of flesh being eaten away by the walking dead?) I got more than my share of gore (those headshots, man, and the screwdriver right through the brain).""Dawn of the Dead"" certainly ranks as one of the best horror movies I've ever seen or probably ever will see; I just hope that the update delivers or at least satisfies my expectations.10/10",Dawn of the Dead

Without having to spend the money to demonstrate the rampage of the dead and the fall of law and order, he makes us feel the world coming apart through the struggle of this group of people to simply do their jobs, before everyone flees in the face of impending doom. Francine (Gaylen Ross), a news producer, and her helicopter pilot boyfriend Stephen (David Emge) plan to take a chopper and fly away to find someplace safe. Stephen invites a friend of his, a solider named Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) and he invites another soldier named Peter (Ken Foree) to tag along after Roger and Peter clear the zombies out of a housing project. The group decides to forgo joining any official refugee or safety zone and instead set out in their helicopter to find their own place. They land on top of a shopping mall (something the movie felt it had to identify and explain to the audience of the late 70s) and set about making a home there, locking the doors and clearing out the zombies inside. Not everything goes swimingly, though, and not all of them will survive the zombies and the marauding humans in the wake of social collapse.Dawn of the Dead is a true horror movie. It is not meant to thrill or excite. It's not even really meant to scare. It is meant to horrify. It employs brutal shock, 70s-era gore and a relentless sense of dread to do so. Romero expands on the concept he first broached in Night, that individual zombies are weak and no real threat but there are so many of them and, like mortality itself, you can't get away from them. No matter how hard you fight, sooner or later you get tired or stupid and they eat you. In addition to the violence, the horror of this film comes from watching these four people try to make new lives for themselves but slowly realize they are just fooling themselves. Their lives are over and they just can't admit it.This film is also historic because, along with Night, it essentially crystallized the ""cannibal zombie apocalypse"" genre in movies. Not only did it establish the basic conventions of the genre, but it demonstrated that the zombie film can be used as a metaphor for human and societal problems. There's a very simple but not that subtle critique of American consumerism in this film, for example. Now, some may say it's just zombie movies, but how often are new genres really created in any media? Romero also created a visual lesson plan here for all future low-budget filmmakers. He demonstrates two basic and vital rules.1. Film things in close up or film things far away. That way you don't have to spend money trying to make everything look good, just the small bit that'll show on screen or the stuff that's close enough to see.2. When you've got a great location or set, exploit the hell out of it.Dawn of the Dead isn't without flaws. There's some really bad music on the soundtrack and some laughably bad 70s-era martial arts are occasionally employed to battle zombies. And Romero also delves into the comedic and slapstick aspects of the living dead. When zombies start getting hit in the face with cream pies, it's a little bit much.None of that that changes the fact that Dawn of the Dead is a great little film and joins Night as and all-time classic of low budget horror.",Dawn of the Dead
62,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""They must be destroyed on sight!""",10,31 October 2014,"This is totally cool man, like the best ever, we're talking *major* legendary classic! People are so familiar with it by now that I kind of found the prospect of reviewing it a little intimidating.. Oh but there was a time when zombies were respected, these were the glory days when George Romero didn't suck, and the undead never broke into more than a stumble at best - and then came along ""28 Days Later"" and suddenly they're being replaced by the 'infected'. Well here's one damn stalwart movie that will never shamble quietly into the night, but will stand solid as a rock forevermore!!! This was such an experience of a film to watch the first time I ever saw it, it was like the zombie Woodstock! I'd never seen anything remotely like it, and it was one of the most magical times I ever had watching any picture. The opening scene is still one of the greatest, it still has such a gripping immediacy to it, pulling you right into the scary hectic world of the film, smack in the middle of the pandemonium of the newsroom that gives a good sense of 'society's' collapse, and then it's the first of several flights to freedom to a gargantuan and seemingly impenetrable fortress of fantasy and everything you could ever want or need...only what it really is, is a kind of hollow prison, a pretty tomb. And then ensues a slow spiritual and mental decline as the four lone inhabitants grow bored and miserable as the realisation sinks in that all the possessions and even the security that their 'paradise' provides doesn't really mean anything, as all that truly matters is freedom as their precarious little group is threatened with destruction left and right... To me what this film isn't at all about is how scary or gory it is or how the makeup effects may or may not look, I just love it for how hugely fun and engrossing it is , and I know a massive part of that enjoyability comes from the mall thing, which was and remains such a stroke of genius. I mean who wouldn't want to wait out the fall of civilisation in a cheerfully-lighted artificial world, surrounded by rousing muzak all day long and an endless abundance of good tidings. Just think of the kind of fort that you could set up! It's clearly an immense labour of love and you can really feel that in the material, although it's very much a film of its time, it's the great spirit of fun but never over-grim horror and adventure that it resonates that keeps it strong and why its appeal to this day is still something that people can seriously dig...(up!) I even love the more outlandish moments like during the opening scene when that artistic fellow very curiously phrases his line:""Our work here is...finished!"" Boy did that guy make the most of his ten seconds.. And then when it shows all of the assorted rural folk in the woods, crackin' open their ""Iron City"" beers, having a party, and behaving as if the apocalypse is the greatest thing to ever happen to them! I also love the surreal moment when the fat- sounding lady announces in her hilariously dead robotic tones over the tannoy that if the customers spend five bucks in the next ten minutes or whatever, then they'll get a bag of hard candies free!!! Wow. I find that the sillier aspects of the movie go a way to help give it its own unique personality, and make the more dramatic tense moments stand out better. This is definitely home-base for me when it comes to zombie movies, and although the look of the zombies is kind of plain and weak it matters not, as these truly are the best, most classic undead ever. Every fan of this has a favourite zombie or moment involving one. My favourite zombie scene is when the hysterically spaced-out square-headed helicopter zombie steps up on the crate and gives himself one lethal haircut - ~Shooom!!!~ What an awesome iconic moment, I never forgot it. I like how most of the time they're so slow and dopey that they're almost lovable, but they're also scarier when they need to be, such as during the climax when their cornering people and tearing them apart. Some are more interesting than others, but all the main cast members made a good team and had a great dynamic between them. I love the performances of Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger and all the charm and charisma they brought to their roles and the chemistry they had together. Especially Reiniger who was a tiny guy but really made his character larger than life, and you really dread Roger's death and it's very sad when he has to be shot, because this film actually takes the time to build up its characters. Foree is just epic as Peter, he punches zombies in the face, tosses them over balconies and even karate kicks them a lot at the end! Certainly one of my all-time favourites, it's so packed with great ideas and themes that you always get your money's worth with it. It's one of those pictures that has the rare quality of leaving the viewer with something new no matter how many times they may have watched it. A pure joy - Hail to the Dawn!!!",Dawn of the Dead

Wow this is terrible, the dialogue, acting, plot, just about everything is beyond B-movie bad but it's growing on me. The scenes with our group of survivors making a home in the mall and utilizing or playing in all the stores is unique and fun. Probably my favourite parts in the movie. Some social commentary on consumerism, regarding the shopping mall, ""why do they keep coming here?"" ""Its what they know.""The makeup remans awful throughout. The undead just have grey face paint, some red around the eyes, when the zombies are eating someone (guts) its pretty good but the blood is bright artificial ruby red.In the end, glad I stuck with this, George Romero spawned an entire genre.",Dawn of the Dead
64,lukem-52760,GEORGE ROMERO'S ZOMBIE MASTERPIECE & ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THE HORROR GENRE.,9,25 October 2019,"I grew up obsessed with Romero's ""Dead Trilogy"" just like i did with Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead Trilogy"" as these Horror films were massive still when i was growing up in the 90's!!!
These films had such sn important impact on the whole movie world & not just within the Horror genre & the most talked about was the 1978 MASTERPIECE ""Dawn of the Dead"" it was the ultimate Horror fantasy for everyone & especially being a young teen & wanting to barricade up in that Awesome empty Shopping mall!!!""Dawn of the Dead"" is a fantastic survival story & an exciting & blood splattered Horror film, a bloody zombie epic that has stood the test of time.
I fell in love with this gritty & bloody Zombie movie when i got it on a very old video & loved it so much, i think my copy was cut abit but still the main exciting premise was there & the cool group of survivors searching for a safe place was so exciting to me!!!The zombie are abit silly & look weird & blueish but that doesn't matter as they are there to get shot up & sliced to bits & they do!!! The best zombies fx from a Romero zombie film came much later with 1985's ""Day of the Dead"" another apocalyptic zombie masterpiece.
Dawn of the Dead has a very cold & bleak mood & atmosphere, the chilly dead of winter Pittsburgh look makes everything feel more raw & brutal, the group of survivors are a cool bunch & each actor gives a solid serious performance especially ""Ken Foree"" who steals the show as the intense & resourceful swat officer ""Peter"" this role made him an instant Cult Hero & loved by the Horror genre!!!
Also the equally intense & tough ""Francine"" is a great character especially for a strong female lead in that time & that is a standout performance from Gaylen Ross.
The little cast is all great though with ""Flyboy"" & ""Roger"" a neat little team that take refuge in a huge abandoned Pittsburgh shopping mall.
The gore is outstanding!!! Legendary ""Tom Savini"" (Sex Machine in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"") is the best in the business of bloody realistic horrific fx.
Dawn of the Dead is a stone cold gritty Classic, a flesh ripping zombie epic & the opening scenes are still raw,gritty & gruesome as hell, i love the police raid on the building that's full of infected zombies it's a fantastic & extremely dark beginning to an apocalyptic masterpiece!!!One of the greatest movies ever made",Dawn of the Dead
65,hu675,One of the Best Romero's Films ever made.,9,13 June 2005,"In this Brilliant, Gory, Funny, Action-Adventure, Horror Film is written and directed by George A. Romero (Knightriders, Creepshow). This is the Sequel to ""Night of the Living Dead (1968)"". The film take place a decade after ""Night of the Living Dead"".The story of the film is about the Living Dead is been overran in Major Cities and the Survivors of the Plague can't do nothing about controlling the problem. Four Survivors (Ken Foree, David Emge, Gaylen Ross and Scott H. Reinger) decide, they are better on their own and finding a safe place. While these survivors are riding on their helicopter, they found a shopping mall outside of Pittsburgh. They were supposed to be there to take supplies but the survivors decide to take a risk to take control of the mall. While these undead creators are inside the mall. Once they destroy them, everything they wanted in their wildest dreams will come true but for now long ? This sequel to ""Night of the Living Dead"" is the best of the Series but we have to wait and see, if Land of the Dead will top ""Dawn of the Dead"" but it's doubtful. This is one of George A. Romero's best films. This film is a rich adventure that jerks the viewers emotions with stunning ease.This film was only release in Europe back in 1978 and turned into a Major Hit. Since Romero got his final cut, this film couldn't be released with an X-Rating. So Romero and Producer:Richard P. Rubinstein kept the final cut as Romero intended it. So the film got released by an independent distribution and it become a Box Office Hit. Originally, this film was supposed to cost 1.5 Million Dollars but it only cost a Half Million Dollars! One of the film's highlights is the good gory Make-Up effects work by Tom Savini (Day of the Dead, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2).You can own the Divimax Edition of Romero's Cut on DVD or if you are a big fan of this film, you could own the Ultimate Edition of ""Dawn of the Dead"" in a Four Disc Set. The Four Disc Set is Superb. You got three alternative versions (Romero's Cut, The Cannes Film Festival's Cut and Co-Producer:Dario Argento's Cut), complete with three different commentaries track for each alternative version with the Cast & Filmmakers of this Classic. The Fourth Disc has two different Documentaries and Two Featurettes. This is a Critically successful Film with movie Viewers and film critics.This classic film got remade in 2004, which it turn out to be a different but a successful remake. The remake is almost as good as the original. Even Tom Savini, Scott H. Reinger and Ken Foree appears in Cameos. Producer:Richard P. Rubinstein (Martin, Pet Semetary) even produced the remake. This is one of the most successful independent horror films of all time. Do not miss this Classic Film, See the 2004 Remake also. Followed by ""Day of the Dead"". (**** ½/*****).",Dawn of the Dead

67,JoeKarlosi,Dawn of the Dead (1978) **1/2,6,2 March 2008,"No matter how many times I've watched this acclaimed horror film (at least a half dozen at this point I'd say), I just can't like it as much as I try to, nor how much so many Romero fanboys do. It functions well enough as a ""pretty good"" end-of-the-world film, and it did spread out fresh ground when it came to gore effects (courtesy of makeup master Tom Savini) and by transforming forever the images we conjured up in our minds when we heard the word ""zombie"" ... the reanimated flesh-eating ghouls we have seen in cinema ever since DAWN was a hit are not of your grandpappy's WHITE ZOMBIE or I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE television days!One of the many chuckles I experience any time a discussion erupts with Romero freaks is when they try to claim today, 30 years after the fact, that DAWN OF THE DEAD was never intended to be a sequel to the classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD ('68). They tend to adopt this recent belief in order to defend 2005's stand-alone entry LAND OF THE DEAD, which was made so long after George's first trilogy that all attempts at connecting the saga together had to get thrown out the window, I guess. Well, it's one thing for some of you to accept LAND as its own entity -- but please don't try to change history all together by suggesting that 1978's DAWN (and the next chapter, 1985's DAY OF THE DEAD) were not all initially considered to be part of the same trilogy side by side with NIGHT, with both progressive films occurring directly as a result of the living dead plague that began in the Sixties. Romero waited 10 years for DAWN, but yet despite the passage of a decade and some nitpicks about hairstyles or a few other technical glitches, it works well enough that we can presume the events herein are taking place not very long after NIGHT's 1968 conclusion. I like the beginning very much in that sense -- the picture starts with chaos and pandemonium still ensuing everywhere, as a half-baked TV news station attempts to find answers to why the hell the dead are returning to life and what can possibly be done about it (someone scrambling around amidst all the commotion manages to say something like ""you haven't been listening for THREE WEEKS!!""). The immediate sense of apocalyptic dread and total loss of control is very well realized. As the story (such as it is) progresses, we follow four survivors who decide to hold up in a shopping mall (a simple google search on the internet reveals that malls like this were around as early as the 1950s, so the story still works within the same timetable as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD) where they'll be able to have everything they need at their fingertips. Of course, they still have to watch out for the ever-increasing number of ghouls who manage to get inside the complex, and to keep fending them off. Where to begin with the problems I have with this overrated film? Let's start with the zombies themselves... they're not very terrifying like they were in the original NIGHT. Almost all of them have a very boring grey-blue makeup on their faces which is the main extent of the physical ""decay"" we see. They are very easily outrun, punched at, slapped about, knocked down, and treated like clowns. They are more to be laughed at by their human ""victims"" rather than feared. So the potential for suspense or terror points to low on the scare meter. It doesn't help either that we have to see these clumsy jesters being belittled against the background of some really silly shopping mall muzak! I'm sure the idea here was to show the surreal nature of seeing the ghouls in contrast with such an ordinary human situation, but this backfires big time. As for all of Romero's alleged ""social commentary on consumerism"" that is supposedly strewn throughout the movie, it's not all that deep and its presence is as wildly exaggerated by fans of the movie as much as everything else. Later on we have a nasty motorcycle gang crashing the party and joining in the frolics, and that's when the funnies with the zombies really take off! Ultimately, these living dead stiffs get pies shoved in their faces (nyuk nyuk nyuk!) and get squirted in their kissers with seltzer bottles (wooo wooo wooo!). Scaaarrrryyyy... I never could get into the four main actors or their characters, with the possible exception of Ken Foree who plays the new African-American leading hero. He's almost as good as Duane Jones had been in the original, and his character is sincere. But I could never stomach that obnoxious know-it-all Roger, who is an expert marksman and doesn't mind flaunting it.Oh, and the damn thing runs too long at just over two hours... and keep in mind that this is only the running time for the ""U.S. Theatrical Version""; there is even a longer and more over-padded edition!! What DAWN OF THE DEAD needed was less comedy, better makeups, more suspense, and to shed at least 30 minutes. It's worth watching, but once you strip away its redundant ""shoot 'em in the head"" philosophy and get over the liberal use of blood, underneath it is nowhere near that overpraised ""classic"" so many horror hounds think it is. **1/2 out of ****",Dawn of the Dead
68,alansabljakovic-39044,Groovy,7,8 April 2020,"I have already watched Snyder's remake so I really wanted to check out the original. The practical effects are great, especially when they are eating someone but the face makeup is really bad, they look like Avatars. This one is also a lighthearted version of Night of Living Dead, basically this movie is having fun in the mall killing zombies. So after watching this I can say Zack Snyder's remake was actually really good, one of the better remakes out there.",Dawn of the Dead
69,fertilecelluloid,Some meat in a blood sandwich,8,5 August 2005,"DAWN is a thoroughly natural sequel to NIGHT, and expands on the ideas the original introduced. The zombies are beginning to spread across the nation like a flu. A small band of survivors takes refuge from the menace in an abandoned shopping mall. Problem is, the dead, who remember what the place once meant to them, have returned to shop...mostly for flesh.I read the novel by Romero and Susanna Sparrow before I saw the movie. Although the movie is more leisurely paced, it is still a horror classic. The idea of containing the bulk of the action within the mall's perimeter works from a thematic and budgetary point of view. What initially seems like a haven becomes a trap for the survivors.A mid-section in which the leads take time out for a haircut and a date stops the narrative dead, and could have done with some trims, but this breather does get us ready for the gory mayhem to come when the Monroeville Mall is overrun by both zombies and bikers intent on butchering them.For the late 70's, the special effects are state-of-the-art. The violence level is high and Romero doesn't wallow too heavily in specific gore set pieces the way Fulci used to. Admittedly, for films like ZOMBIE and THE BEYOND, Fulci's love of the gruesome made his films better because they were little but gore and atmosphere.Romero, as is often said, uses his films to comment on issues of race, status and gender. He doesn't overdo the sermonizing, but the characters do sound like they've got their own speechwriter sometimes. Still, the director/writer can hardly be faulted for injecting some meat into his blood sandwich.A remake followed two decades later and had little in common with this.",Dawn of the Dead
70,dworldeater,Total classic and still holds up,10,8 March 2016,"Night Of The Living Dead may have been first, but in my opinion Dawn Of The Dead is by far the most influential of his ""Dead"" films from that point to the present. Of course, all of George's films are important and made their mark on fans and film makers. His ""Dead"" films have the most influence and pretty much everyone has been imitating his work ever since. Dawn Of The Dead is the best loved and most groundbreaking of these films. Dawn Of The Dead is a masterpiece that works on many levels and still holds up after all these years. The film has a lot to offer that one will not find in the average horror flick, but delivers the goods for those most interested in gore. Dawn Of The Dead is simultaneously action packed and thought provoking. The film is abundant with social commentary, but is done in a comic book style so it does not come across as preachy or pretentious. However, the social subtext is there if the viewer chooses to be a participant. The characters are well developed and easy to like. Our ensemble cast had great chemistry and did a very good job in this. I especially love Ken Foree's bad ass performance. If there was justice in the world of film George A Romero would have been the recipient of all kinds of awards and Ken Foree would be a top action star. Tom Savini's gore f/x look great and set standards in the film industry. It also got Tom Savini a lot of work and made him a top name in special make up f/x. The score by band Goblin gave the film some ominous atmosphere and made some very interesting and incredible music. George A Romero blends the genres of science fiction, horror and action well. I have a lot of respect for George A Romero and Dawn Of The Dead is a true classic and absolutely essential.",Dawn of the Dead
71,Witchfinder-General-666,One of the All-time Essentials of Horror and Cinema in General!,10,11 September 2008,"Among true Horror fans, ""Dawn of the Dead"" of 1978 is doubtlessly one of the most celebrated films of all time. And for good reasons. George A. Romero had basically created the modern Zombie film with brilliant 1968 predecessor ""Night Of The Living Dead"", a pioneering movie that had uniquely combined spine-chilling Horror with social commentary about people's behavior in isolated and extreme situations. The second film set in Romero's world of the living dead is THE masterpiece of modern Zombie cinema, and for a Horror fan this is the most brilliant cinematic experience possibly imaginable. Yes, talking in superlatives is indispensable when discussing this film, as it is simply THE GREATEST in so many aspects. This is a milestone in Horror that is simply brilliant in any aspect - be it the incomparably menacing atmosphere, the extreme creepiness, the breathtaking suspense, the genuine scares and shocks, the nauseating gore, the brilliant score and cinematography or the ingenious subplots. As much as it is an incredibly atmospheric and gory Horror film, ""Dawn"" is a brilliantly cynical social commentary about the monstrous in modern human beings in extreme situations. Unlike any other film, ""Dawn of The Dead"" is the ultimate proof that extreme violence and nauseating gore can go in hand with incomparable genius in plotting and clever writing that even comments on capitalist society in an ingeniously sarcastic manner.Once again, the dead walk the earth. Driven by a mysterious plague, they rise from their graves, hungry for the flesh and blood of the living. Fleeing the growing masses of zombies, swat-team members Stephen (David Emge) and Peter (Ken Foree) as well as reporters Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) and Francine (Gayleen Ross) seek shelter in an abandoned shopping mall, which becomes their oasis in an apocalyptic land infested by the living dead - an oasis they are willing to defend...The film is stunningly suspenseful, immensely creepy and simply breathtaking from the first minute. The film begins when the public becomes aware with the wave of living dead that is threatening society, and the wave of hysteria it brings along. What follows are two and a half hours that rank among the most stunning and unforgettable ever in Horror cinema (More precisely, it's between 117 and 156 minutes depending on which cut you see). The film has an incomparable atmosphere that is both incredibly menacing and creepy, and ingeniously absurd. The lonely shelter in-between armies of braindead, flesh-eating zombies becomes some sort of paradise of consumerism. The film's ingenious sense of humor however, never overwhelms. ""Dawn of the Dead"" is among the creepiest, most breathtakingly suspenseful films ever brought to screen, the masses of the undead are the scariest and most menacing fiend imaginable. The gore effects by master Tom Savini are brilliant and ultra-bloody. The film's creepiness and menacing atmosphere is even increased by the ingenious score by Progressive Rockers/Film score composers Goblin (who are responsible for some of the most brilliant scores in Italian Horror cinema, including those to the masterpieces by Dario Argento, who was also involved in this film). There are several different cuts of the film, all of which are essential: The theatrical version (126 minutes), the extended version (139 minutes), Dario Argento's Eurocut (117 minutes), which is a little shorter but has even more gore and is more constantly accompanied by the musical score, and the Ultimate final cut (156 minutes). All are essential viewing for Horror fans! In short: ""Dawn of the Dead"" is not only one of the all-time essentials of Horror, but one of the greatest films ever made and no cinema-lover could possibly afford to miss it! 10/10",Dawn of the Dead
72,TOMNEL,Perphaps the best zombie movie ever made.,10,27 May 2006,"Directed by George A. Romero. Starring: David Emgee, Ken Foree, Gaylen Ross, Scott Reiniger and Tom Savini.This is not only arguably the best zombie movie, but is now a cult classic. It's a pretty simple, plot of hiding out in the mall while the zombies attack, but it's just written so well. It's direction is really good too. Mr. Romero did long scenes of the mall with music, which slowed down the pace of the film, and made it much more enjoyable than it would've been. The song entitled, ""The Gonk"" is used so perfectly in this film when the zombies are in the mall. I can't say enough good things about it. The acting is good, the music is good and the direction/writing is good. Tom Savini also provides good gore effects, and Savini plays a role in the film as the head biker helping kill the zombies. The only problem anybody would have with this is that the blood and guts are pretty much only abundant the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes....but there's plenty of it to go around. So in conclusion I obviously highly recommend the Godfather of zombies flicks.4/4 stars. 128 minutes. rated R for Gory Violence and Some language.",Dawn of the Dead
73,a_chinn,Zombies as mindless consumers in Romero's indictment of consumerism in a capitalist society,10,24 July 2018,"Writer/Director George A. Romero introduced the film world to the modern day version of zombies with his 1968 horror classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" and with this 1978 sequel he takes the living dead horror sub-genre he created to the next level, introducing the living dead to a much wider post-apocalyptic world where civil order has completely broken down. There are a handful of movies like ""A Boy and His Dog"" or ""The Omega Man"" or ""The Ultimate Warrior"" that were made earlier and showed a destroyed world with scavengers living off the remnants of our ruined world, but Romeo's vision of the apocalypse shows the actual breakdown (a pre-apocalypse, if you will) that led to that broken post-apocalyptic world. The only other film I can think of that did something similar to this was Ray Milland's ""Panic in Year Zero,"" although that film was nowhere as harrowing and by the end of the film order was restored. As with all of Romero's Dead films, this second film in the series follows a new set of characters. A TV news station manager is working as things begin to fall apart. That's when she and her ""Flyboy"" helicopter pilot boyfriend take off for somewhere safe, along with a pair of SWAT Team deserters, one of whom is played by genre mainstay Ken Foree, the only real name actor in the film (unless you count Tom Savini in a memorable bit part near the end of the film) in an early acting role. The group flies out into the night when it becomes clear that the police and national guard have lost control and it's everyone for themselves. There's a great moment at one point that subtly underscores frightening nature of the breakdown when Flyboy asks a police officer loading supplied on a boat where he's going and the office replies, ""Down river. We got an idea maybe we can make it to the island!"" When asked what island, he replies ""Any island."" The foursome also fly off without any idea where they are going, but eventually stumble upon a shopping mall and quickly figure out that this place is loaded with everything they need to survive. Before they can move in though, they have to clear the mall of zombies, which is the film's high point and extremely entertaining. This portion of the film is likely why ""Dawn of the Dead"" is the most popular of the Dead films, because of the wish fulfillment aspect of being able to have your run of a mall, taking what you want, eating what you want, and having everything you ever wanted without any consequences. I think this was the first post-apocalyptic film to make the end-of-the-world seem fun. This kind of wish fulfillment was revisited memorably in ""Night of the Comet"" and a few other last-man-on-earth and end-of-the-world stories, but Romero uses this story element to make a political statement about consumerism and capitalism, something he's done with all of his Dead films, using the zombie story as an avenue to make a socio-political statement. It's this subtext that sets Romero's zombie films apart from others. Not only are they entertaining, but they also have something to say. Asked why zombies seem to be covering on the mall, Ken Foree replies, ""They're after the place. They don't know why; they just remember. Remember that they want to be in here."" To which Francine asks ""What the hell are they?"" Flyboy replies ""They're us, that's all."" Mindless consumers drawn to the mall, which is what our foursome also becomes once they clear out the mall and find themselves rich, bored, and left empty once they've accumulated everything they've ever wanted. However, as with all capitalist societies, there's always someone else who's envious of what you have and they don't, so enter Tom Savini and is biker gang who want to break into the mall and loot their peaceful sanctuary. This may make ""Dawn of the Dead"" sound very quite intellectual and thought provoking, which I believe it is, but it's also bloody, cartoony fun on a straight entertainment level, delivering some excellent horror suspenseful movie moments as well. The film contains a number of iconic horror movie moments, including a zombie getting the top of his head sliced off with a helicopter blade, a notorious shotgun head explosion, a blood pressure machine, and really too many classic moments to mention. Tom Savini's cartoony, yet horrifyingly gory special effects are a real treat for fans of old-school practical effects. And in regards to straight up zombie action, there are some unique situations, including one where I was quite taken aback upon rewatching the film where Ken Foree finds himself fighting off two child-zombies and having to shoot them, which was more shocking of a scene than I remember. Another part of the film that has to be given it's due is the terrific score by Gobin (billed as The Goblins) and Dario Argento. The pounding synthesizers over the film's opening help establish the dour and hopelessness of the zombie onslaught, while at the same time the campy mall muzak is a hilarious ear-worm that you cannot get out of your head. One unpleasant surprise rewatching this film was how bad the photography was. There seemed to be many scenes that were out of focus or the lighting was off, that I was did not remember. You could argue that this helps with the film's grunginess and punk rock attitude, but it mainly just looks amateurish. However, that's a minor blemish on what is otherwise a classic horror film that surpasses the original and remains of the best zombie flicks ever committed to film.",Dawn of the Dead
74,vertigo_14,Oh the horror of this horrible horror film!,2,27 February 2004,"I can't understand why people rave about this movie so much? I can't imagine what audiences of the day thought of it, given I wasn't alive then, and since then, horror movies have pulled out all the limits trying to impress and hopefully, shock audiences. But, I'm judging this movie as it I see it now. And I was not impressed. In fact, I was bored as hell, and forced myself to sit through the remainder.We rented the special edition Director's Cut, as it was all the video store had. Now, I like a good zombie movie, even if the story is a little ridiculous, so long as the special effects are commendable. Simply enough, zombies are on the loose, and it has turned the whole town into an anarchic ghost town. Four folks, the focus of the story, hide out in a mall, dodging zombies and taking advantage of the new, free lodging.
The special effects were alright. Probably super duper in their day. And the acting just stunk it up a little bit, not much. I mean, they weren't excessively mellowdramatic or dreamy about everything. But for god sakes, I mostly sat through three hours of random zombie growling scenes and people having a grand ol' time in the abandoned mall. Big whoopdeedoo. They could've said all that in about half an hour and it would've been fantastic with me.",Dawn of the Dead
75,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Much Deeper than just a Zombie Film,10,9 March 2019,"This film is one of my favorite films of all time. I grew up watching this film and liked it for what I saw, but it was going to college and starting to analyze films that really made me realize how much I love it. For those that don't know, this is the second film in writer/director George A. Romero's Dead series. The official synopsis is following an ever-growing epidemic of zombies that have risen from the dead, two Philadelphia S. W. A. T. team members, a traffic reporter and his television executive girlfriend seek refuge in a secluded shopping mall.I have to give Romero credit in how he introduces the characters. Francine (Gaylen Ross) wakes up in the television station that she works at because this epidemic is running so rampant that they have to be there. The station is trying to host a show that will give information to their viewers and one way to getting people to tune in is to run the list of rescue stations. Francine is upset the list is outdated, but her boss wants her to keep running it to get ratings. Her boyfriend, Stephen (David Emge), tells her that they need to flee. He is a helicopter pilot and that is what they are going to use.It shifts to a project building where a group of people are holding up. They don't want to leave their home, but they are being forced to evacuate. Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) tries to comfort a newer officer when the armed men come out of the building, guns blazing. Things go crazy as there are infected residents and an officer goes mad with killing anyone in his way. He is put down by another officer. Roger goes to the basement to get away from it and meets that other officer, Peter (Ken Foree). He invites him to join his crew that is fleeing that night.They end up holding up in a mall where they decide to seal it off and create their own society. There are complications along the way, the worst of which a motorcycle gang that is out to loot without care for anything around them.It is an excellent zombie film and one of the best in this genre. I think a lot of that for me is the social issues that are tackled with it, along with an interesting look at this group as they try to survive. There is the need to recreate society, but then we also see the worst of this people. That isn't to say though there aren't flaws.There are some parts that are unrealistic and things that happen wouldn't probably happen in real life. The blood is a little too orange and some of the ways people are bit couldn't happen, but it doesn't affect the film too much for me. I can forgive this in part to movie magic. Without ramping up the tension with some of this, the movie would be boring. It is actually a sign of the times and it does give the film a bit of a comic book feel.The most important thing to me is the issues that Romero tackles with this film. A big one is that the zombies come to the mall after they turned and it takes a look at us as a nation, in that we are slave to commerce. The film makes it seem that even after we are dead and return as a zombie, we will still go back to what we did without really knowing why. It is also brings up that zombies might have some residual memories that are drawing them there. Another issue I didn't catch on to until more recent viewings was the television show in the beginning. The man running the studio is more worried about ratings as the world is ending than sending people to closed shelters. It really shows where some people's priorities are.There is also an issue of sexism, a little bit of racism and there also is a look at the degeneration of society. I do like that Francine stands up to be respected like one of the men and Stephen resists her in this endeavor. I do like that she doesn't stand idly by though. Peter though would be the best character here is that he listens to her, but also tells her how it will be.Now the acting in this film was done by mostly unknown people and many of them haven't done much after this. The person that I'm impressed by the most is Foree. He did go on to become a famous horror film actor and has done some other things, but he is the glue that keeps everyone together. He is the hero and this is an example against the stereotype of this character dying first. He allows Fracine to talk, listens to her and gives in to her demands, because none of them are unreasonable. Ross as I have slightly touched on is similar to Foree in that she is a minority as a woman. It turns out that she is pregnant as well. She stands up to Stephen at every turn, which I like to see since he does boss her around. It is even better that he proposes in this film to her and she shuts it down immediately. She isn't as vocal as Peter, but she is strong willed. Reiniger is also great to me because mentally he starts to lose it from the opening scenes he is in. We see when it finally snaps, I love it as it complicates things. Peter notices it and tries to keep his head in what they're doing, because it is jeopardizing not only himself, but everyone. He does a great job in this portrayal. I also thought Emge does great. We see that he's not really being able to handle himself. He makes things more difficult and Peter doesn't like him. He does become an asset as the film progresses. The rest of the cast round out the film for what they needed.I also wanted to touch on that the editing of this film was also done by Romero, and I like what he did. The shots and how they are put together are great. Now there are some errors that occur during this, like women zombies changing into men so the stunts could be done, but it doesn't ruin the film. I didn't even notice some of these until viewing the film as many times as I have. For being a 2 hour film, it doesn't feel like it.The bigger thing is the soundtrack. It was done by Dario Argento and the band Goblin, who did a lot of films soundtracks with the Italian director. It has crazy sounds, but also adds creepiness. I think it really enhances the film for me. This is one of my favorite soundtracks and I listen to it regularly. Depending on the version being watched, there is some studio, royalty free music that I have nostalgia for. It fits for what the movie needed.The last thing would be the practical effects that were done by Tom Savini for the film. I personally love them. As stated though, the blood is a little bit too orange, but I personally don't mind it being from the 70's where vivid color was a big thing. I love the gory ending and what happens to those that the zombies actually get their hands on. There are some problematic things the zombies do, but this is something else I'll chalk up to movie magic.I would highly recommend this film. It is a great zombie flick and a really solid film in general. This one does have a longer running time, but I don't think that affects it. I thought the tension builds as the world ends around them. The acting is great, the action is as well and the story itself is amazing. There is a gory finale and there is a good amount of blood in general. The editing was well done and I personally find the soundtrack to be amazing, to the point that I own it. This is a film is a solid view and I recommend it. A rare horror film that is good, but also looks at some issues that are still relevant today.",Dawn of the Dead
76,Samiam3,"Come dawn, you'll have some fun",8,6 September 2009,"A reporter, her boyfriend, and two soldiers, escape death in a helicopter, and take refuge from the nation wide zombie army, in a shopping centre, where they can create their own self- fulfilling materialist world, typical of the baby boomer generation. Sound familiar, if so then it's only because of the numerous rip offs and remakes of this horror masterpiece, which equals (and sometimes surpasses) its predecessor.As far as I can tell, Dawn of the Dead is the first film, which makes gore fun, thanks to horror make-up whiz Tom Savini. It also goes to show that lots of money, and production values are not needed to make a good horror. Unlike Dawn of the Dead, this movie is rather light-spirited. You may even friend your self smiling, more than you do wincing, and screaming. Considering what has come out since, there is never a majorly unpleasant moment in Dawn of the Dead.Maybe some would disagree with me, but no horror fan will turn his/her back on this one. It is good enough to make you hungry while watching it.",Dawn of the Dead
77,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The most popular of Romero's Zombie franchise,9,15 March 2014,"George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968) was as much a critically successful movie as it was a controversial one. With very few films pushing the boundaries of realistic horror and gore, Romero not only created a universal icon but brought upon a wave of new horror films to come. Who knew he would even make a sequel 10 years down the road from his original masterpiece. Nor is any less of greatness expected. Here is another example of a highly defined sequel that matches its parent very closely. Some may even consider it better than the first.This second ""dead"" sequel starts a story about a group of strangers who come together under a common roof and try to survive against the ongoing zombie invasion. Upon their travels, they'll come across many obstacles and end up taking refuge in a shopping mall inhabited by zombies. It may not seem like much of a plot, but in fact it still packs in quite a lot of material into the running time - considering the time is now almost up to two and half hours. Out of the four people, two of them are military buddies and the other two are a couple.Interestingly enough, George A. Romero, who wrote the screenplay did another great job at giving depth to these characters. The more and more these characters spend time with each other, the more of a bond a viewer will begin to see between them. This allows for character development and the ability for the audience to actually feel invested in the story that they are watching. Witnessing how this group of regular people fight to survive the every day occurrence of running into a zombie is a mixed bag of emotions. Why? According to what these characters do, you can still have fun during a zombie apocalypse, you can tease them, you can throw pies in their faces, and you can even run over them with vehicles. The thing is, you'd also learn not to let your guard down. It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt unfortunately. When incidences like these, happen, you (the viewer) will feel the loss of that investment that was put into those believable characters. Helping make these losses feel realistic are the groundbreaking special effects for the gore scenes handled by Tom Savini. It is still not a frequent event but there is plenty of blood and a few disgusting moments. Perhaps the only thing that didn't feel in place was the soundtrack. In various scenes it does work but in others it doesn't at all like the memorable but goofy end credit song to the film. Other than that it's hard to debate about things that could've been improved because there's not much to not enjoy.George A. Romero produced a sequel that not only has better production quality but still maintains the ability to capture its audience with a story that compels with such a small cast.",Dawn of the Dead
78,slayrrr666,Zombie greatness for all,10,28 December 2004,"""Dawn of the Dead"" will always be the ultimate zombie movie.**SPOILERS**A news show in Pittsburgh begins reporting that the zombies are now beginning to win the battles against the living. Reporter Francine (Gaylen Ross) leaves the station with Steven (David Emge) in a station chopper. At the same time, a police squadron is called to an apartment complex in the ghetto for counts of cannibalism. After battling the zombies, two police officers, Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger, (Scott H. Reiniger) find the helicopter with the escaping Francine and Steven and leave with them. Finally making their way to Monroeville Mall, the four find that the complex has everything they need to survive. Barricading themselves inside, they live in peace, occasionally meeting the zombies. They eventually decide to give the mall to the zombies, as they seem to have called the structure home. A gang of bikers arrives, and they simply find the mall open for their taking. Fighting on the side of the zombies, they fight off the advancing hordes. Succeeding, now the zombies find that they are prime targets to attack, and ramble on after them. Finally able to survive, those that do look back on the mall with a wink of nostalgia.The Good News: One of the main reasons why people love this movie is its non-stop gore. This is right up there with ""Dead Alive"" as one of the most violent movies of all time. We have untold decapitations, a screwdriver in the ear, two bodies torn apart in a long matter of time, more than ten different people have at least a piece of skin bitten off or ripped open, one is set on fire, and another one has the top of its head sliced off with a helicopter blade. I am literally talking about the tip of the iceberg here. This is merely some of the violence that happens to regular people from the zombies. That's not even close to the violence that the regular people inflict on the zombies. Most of them are massive gunshot wounds to the head, since it kills them. We see some very nice, gory-looking head kills in the movie. There are so many that the film would simply be R-rated only on head kills. It really is a treat for gore-hounds to see all the violence in the film, both to and from the zombies. I could go on and on about the gore in the film, but the film does contain so many other things. To me, the action in the film is just as good as the gore. The best scene has to be towards the end, when the bikers are in the mall facing the zombies. This includes not only a lot of gore, but a lot of action as well. The giant gunfight is one of the best scenes ever shot. The fact that the cops shoot off against the bikers, who have to worry about the zombies attacking them. To have it last as long as it did and never have it be a boring fight, that's a major accomplishment. That is also a very big deal; the film is over two hours long, and at no point is it a boring movie. To have a horror film do that is such a great feat. What really amazed me about the movie was its character development. It is one of the few films where we really do care about what happens to the people involved. There aren't as many people who we care about in modern horror films. They are supposed to be similar to the people from these kinds of films, but they don't have the same impact as the earlier films. Granted, they don't have as great of acting classes as modern stars, but the important thing is that the heroes come across as likable, which hardly any modern day film does. It is something that I sorely miss in horror films.The Bad News: Everyone always says that this film is a very smart satirical film, and I never knew why. Personally, I don't care if it does or not, because it is such a great film that it carries a subliminal message doesn't concern me. I don't try to analyze the hidden meanings in films. I just watch it to enjoy the movie. If you feel like you want to watch the film a hundred times to see how many different scenes hold another meaning, go right ahead. It doesn't concern me to know, and I respect those that do, but I don't want to know that kind of thing. So what if it has hidden meanings? Doesn't bother me. I watch this film for its entertainment value, not how many different things Romero is poking fun at.The Final Verdict: Even though there are those that say this film is loaded with social satire, I have no interest in finding it and simply watch this movie because it is so entertaining. Watch this film if you seek out gory, violent films of any kind, as it offers everything that they will enjoy. Seek caution if seeing gore disturbs you.Rated NC-17: Extreme Graphic Violence",Dawn of the Dead

80,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,"Stick with this classic, not the remake!",10,26 September 2014,"This 1970's zombie classic, albeit very gory, depicts what happens when society panics and you never know who to trust or how long a good thing will last.In a hypothetical scenario where zombies are destroying much of North America, two news crew traffic control employees (Francine and Stephen), and two S.W.A.T. team members (Peter and Roger), find themselves forming a friendship and trying to survive as they watch society collapse through the screens of their televisions and voices from their radios. When Stephen steals a helicopter the four find themselves able to create a decent enough residence in a large shopping mall, and find that with weapons and security, the zombies won't bother them. They have electricity, a never-ending supply of food, water, books, makeup, clothing, cosmetics, vinyl records, and they watch the outside world through a TV broadcast featuring Dr. Millard R., a cynical but truthful news reporter with an eyepatch who sadly says that the only way the remaining humans will survive is to be logical and unemotional.The problem is, how long will this new way of life work out? Scr*w the 2004 remake, this thrilling, at times comedic, and action-packed zombie film is the better one, hands down! Right away you fall in love with the characters, and you can laugh at the funny situations and watch with suspense as things get bad. The zombies, average joes rounded up to be minor actors, they're a laugh-riot. There are obese zombies falling into the mall fountains from escalators, one-armed zombies, zombie children, believe me it's worth seeing! And come on, who wouldn't want free access to all items and services in their local mall? Free movies, free money from the cash registers, free food, free designer clothing...The music is one of my favorite parts of all. It's nostalgic and retro, yet eerie, melancholy, creepy, and it provides the perfect atmosphere for every scene! The acting was excellent and every character had their own unique personality, from mysterious and skilled shooter but incredibly caring Peter to joker Roger. The plot, well, it was without a doubt one of Romero's best films! So what if it doesn't have the overused and unimprovised CGI of the 21st century, or the loud, annoying, post-apocalyptic death metal soundtrack in zombie movies today? The original Dawn of the Dead, from 1978, is a landmark in the horror genre. Don't pass it up and leave it in the dust for its pathetic remake.",Dawn of the Dead
81,dunmore_ego,Die! And don't come back!,1,1 December 2009,"They call this movie a classic. They also call director George A. Romero a legend. Lots of things become famous for the wrong reasons. Carrie Prejean is famous and she's a bubbled-headed, big-titted bigot; Jon and Kate are famous and they're the world's most despicable parents; Rush Limbaugh is famous and he's a bubble-headed, big-titted bigot.DAWN OF THE DEAD is supposedly a great film. I really tried to see what made it so. I took all the right drugs and bribed all the right congressmen. I psychoanalyzed it until the blood rushed to my little green brain and made jelly beans... but there is no excuse for DAWN OF THE DEAD to exist. Like its subject matter, it is a stinking corpse - yet it still walks.Made as a kind of follow up to his bad zombie movie of a decade earlier, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968), DAWN is actually worse. Ten years, the man learns nothing! Romero: ""I always used to say that I'd rather have 100 bad shots than ten that are beautiful."" Well, you got it.In DAWN, a zombie epidemic causes four people to join forces and hole up in a shopping mall to fight off the zombies and then eke out a secluded existence with the mall's resources; Philadelphia SWAT guys, Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger (Scott H. Reiniger), TV reporter Francine (Gaylen Ross) and her chopper pilot boyfriend Stephen (David Emge).How do we tell the difference between the zombies and the actors? Oh yeah, the zombies are the ones acting.Every scene illustrates the embarrassing failure of this movie's credibility, but I need only describe one: Francine stands five feet away from Stephen, who grapples with a zombie. He shouts at her to run - but there's a zombie fifty feet away, shambling slowly toward her blocking her path. It's fifty feet away. In an open field. Shambling so fast it might reach her by Christmas next year. She ""indicates"" that she's worried. Because Stephen is grappling with that zombie five feet away and she can't help him because she's a woman and stuff. Closeup of Francine worried. Cutaway to zombie fifty feet away, shambling, blocking her path; in a 360-degree open field, the horror is that she only has 359 degrees to thread the needle and escape from that zombie. She tries to help her man by watching him intently, but that doesn't work, so she tries to indicate some more that she's faced with a conundrum of how to dodge the zombie fifty feet away - oh, hang on, it's forty-nine feet away now. The terror is so unbearable, it's bearable.Stephen overcomes his zombie and grabs Francine's arm to drags her to safety. She is, after all, blond, and can't be expected to escape from zombies without tripping, screaming irritatingly or getting killed in her bra and panties.Here's the punchline, folks: as soon as bad actor Stephen gets dork Francine to safety - she starts bitching about equal rights in making decisions! BOING! To prove her equality with the male gender, when zombies break in, Francine stands and screams irritatingly until a man has to come over and kill them for her.Peter, the big black SWAT guy, explains the zombie holocaust: his granddad was a priest in Trinidad who used to say, ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the Earth."" So coming from a priest, it MUST be true. No matter that priests should have the lowest credibility on Earth for subscribing to supernatural idiocy in the first place as if it was truth... So there's no more room in hell, huh? I guess that proves how piggish the human race is - we've filled it up with ourselves. Guess God was too weak for the devil after all, huh?...DAWN OF THE DEAD is an embarrassment to fans of good movie-making and to horror movie fans. The fact that people laud it as some kind of benchmark is more a testament to the sheep mentality of all you humans who are going to fill up hell than the quality of the movie.Again with the excuses: ""It was good for its day."" What's that supposed to mean, when other people in other films were ACTING in 1978? People in GREASE, and TAXI DRIVER, THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL, THE DEER HUNTER... Or what about horror movies of ""its day"": THE OMEN in 1976, THE EXORCIST in 1973.Just when we think the movie can't get any worse, bikers arrive at the mall, led by Tom Savini. And - impossibly - the movie gets stupider! The zombies are not the subject any more, as the bikers fool with them, throw custard pies at them, kick them over, chop off their limbs, etc. So Stephen starts shooting at the bikers for availing themselves of all the mall resources that up till now, only Stephen and his pals were stealing.I read some outlandish commentary on DAWN that proposed Romero was trying to illustrate the difference between stealing for necessity (our heroes) and stealing for fun (the bikers) - but, besides the fact that the bikers are also stealing for necessity (in a society that has alienated them through disparity of wealth), Romero was not making any such commentary. He was merely trying to kick out the jams after planting our heroes in a rut of super delicious ultra boredom.The deaths of some of our heroes are funnier than their misbegotten acting performances could ever be. But that's okay, cos they come back to life anyway, cos hell is full, so even if they are shot and killed again, they still have to come back, see...--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",Dawn of the Dead
82,oneguyrambling,"A classic, but not a GREAT film.",7,27 November 2010,"So the original was made in 1978 and found 4 survivors of an unknown holocaust taking shelter in a shopping mall, where they were beset by bad music and cheap special effects for well over 2 hours of screen time.The zombies shuffle about and are easily evaded unless they have great numbers, and the variations of ""nearly gotcha"" situations quickly became old to me.It was always a question of who would die and who wouldn't, and when they did how gory would it all be? (Some die, some don't and none of the main characters go out in massively gory fashion.) Do I really need spoiler-warnings for a 30 year old film? Apparently the film was seen as a vicious condemnation of the ""zombie-like"" tendency of many Americans to worship a consumer culture. That is such bullshit.It is basically a movie where bad actors in grey and blue makeup shuffle about ""ooooooh""-ing at each other, separated by long quiet bits and some el-cheapo but effective gore effects. If George Romero had intended to make a brilliant satire he sure as hell didn't tell anyone, least of all himself.So let's pretend he did mean it for a moment shall we, how exactly did the bikies showing up so they could get ripped to pieces and give the good guys a reason to defend themselves work? What special underlying meaning did that have? Was it the invention of the internet and how it is inevitable that our shopping culture must change? Or was it just a good excuse to bring in some warm bodies that the audience don't care about so they can get ripped to shreds by the undead? I sure as hell vote for the latter.The problem with the original Dawn of the Dead is that even though it was groundbreaking at the time, there have been hundreds of movies that have taken the reins and run further and further, and done it in a superior and more entertaining manner.Even the most sh*tty zombie movies build tension better and have more action than this film, and wait to see how I go with the remake. Was it Romero's fault that he was first? No. But that is irrelevant.Final Rating – 7 / 10. Dawn of the Dead 1978 is pretty good even now. It is sometimes clever and has some effective scenes, but to call it some work of genius is just stupidity.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",Dawn of the Dead

I love the dialogue about the zombies including ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.""

Not long after the original, the zombies are still coming back to life and feeding on the flesh of the living. A group of friends named Stephen, Peter, Roger, and Francine leave Philadelphia in a helicopter and see that the epidemic is worldwide.

84,mentalcritic,Leagues ahead of the remake....,9,11 February 2005,"In spite of following on from Night Of The Living Dead, Dawn stands well on its own as a commentary about consumerism and herd conformity. I think a lot of modern filmmakers miss the latter detail about zombie pieces these days. When I see a well-made zombie film, I am reminded of a line from a song by The Cure: ""Everybody's happy, they're finally all the same..."" Not only are the zombies an expression of how the most sluggish mediocrity can overwhelm us all if we let our guard down, they show exactly what the human race would be once stripped of individuality or quirk. If there is one thing that Romero's original zombie trilogy showed well, then this is it.Dawn Of The Dead brings the scenario of Night into a wider focus. Set an undetermined time after Night, Dawn picks up with the organised response of wider society breaking down. The shelters that have been set up to provide refuges from the dead are being overrun, and the television stations are beginning to suffer the same fate. One group of staff at such a television station take a helicopter out to a shopping mall. The mall is already slightly populated with zombies. The question of why they came to this place is asked once, and it is supposed that the mall was once an important place in their lives. At this time, shopping malls were becoming more than just a fixture of the deep urban centres, so the relevance of the idea has only grown with time.Dawn's primary weak spot is in the reduced cast, which in turn allows a reduced scope for human interaction. For the most part, we only get to see four human characters, and little effort is made to give them a third dimension. For the most part, all we see are various efforts to board up the mall. Exactly what they hope to achieve this way is never made clear, but we'll let that slide. It certainly doesn't appear as if they will do any better taking their chances outside. Towards the end of the film, a little competition for resources is introduced. The bikers add a little breadth to the cast, but it becomes a case of too little, too late. This would be about the only area where the 2004 remake improves on the 1978 original. The cast of the later production is large enough to allow some human interaction, therefore drama.The advantage that the 1978 film has over its remake is that it does not underestimate the intelligence of the audience. Rather than fall into the same bland submission or herd conformity that it is aiming to critique, Dawn Of The Dead circa 1978 is very much a thinking man's film. Philosophical questions are raised about how we define life, what we do when it's over for others, and a host of ancillary questions. That the principal characters don't give up when they realise just how hopeless their situation is defies belief, too. Such unwillingness to go quietly into the night could tie in quite nicely to the finally-underway Isle Of The Dead (or whatever Romero is calling it now) project. In fact, just watching this episode gave me visions of a city cobbled together from abandoned buildings and other such architectural refuse.When all the pros and cons are added up, I wound up giving Dawn Of The Dead a nine out of ten. It's one less than Night Of The Living Dead, and a few more than Day Of The Dead, so I think it is a pretty fair score, all things considered. The 2004 remake, by comparison, is no better than any of the cheap Return Of The Living Dead type knock-offs or their ilk. Give it a good watch, and it isn't too hard to learn why popular opinion has it that Hollywood just can't do a credible zombie film (Resident Evil: Apocalypse, anyone?).",Dawn of the Dead

Romero's Dawn of the Dead has justifiably earned it's place as a premium horror movie, the best about Zombies (perhaps narrowly matched by the terrific Dellamorte Dellamore). Much, much better than the totally overrated Night of the Living Dead, Dawn is that rare piece of horror film that is socially conscious as well as delivering it's fair share of thrills and gore.Setting the film in a mall and attacking consumerism is a nice touch. The recently dead come to the place they identify themselves with the most, and hordes and hordes of people fill the mall. It's very funny, but also feels right on the mark. I bet I'd even go to the mall, hate to admit it.Romero builds the film well. It's slow moving but never longwinded. He gradually builds tension and actually makes time for the characters to register properly. It's also nice to see them behave in a mostly logical manner, not the stupid way most one-dimensional characters have that viewers have been blessed with in too many horror movies to count.I recently bought the Ultimate Anchor Bay DVD set, which has no less than 3 editions of the film. The original theatrical version is the one I think most people are passing judgement on and my review is based on that edition. I simply like it when characters are given space to grow on viewers and it has the right amount of gore and action, and it's pretty funny as well. That said, the version I probably will watch the most in coming years is the Dario Argento edit. It moves faster, it cuts down the humour and it has a much better music score. Romero's library cues are no match for the bombastic score by Goblin, and had Romero's version used Argento's music score, it would have been even better. Argento's edit is more enjoyable, though basically Romero's edit is the better one.",Dawn of the Dead
86,MrGKB,Unmistakeably the Godfather of the zombie film genre...,10,25 October 2008,"...and one of my all-time favorite movies, George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" reset the standards for cinematic horror as the 70s drew to a close. Its inspired combination of bleak realism, social commentary, gallows humor, and cartoonish-yet-viscerally-effective Grand Guignol special effects paved the way for all that was yet to come. The only horror movies of the period with remotely comparable influence (imnsho) would be John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" both of which already owed immense debts to Romero's seminal lo-fi classic ""Night of the Living Dead"".I feel sorrow for today's young, ADHD-impaired, insufferably jaded audience, many of whom are seemingly unable to invest themselves in a film. I have no doubt that most of the negative comments on this site are from viewers who've never seen ""Dawn of the Dead"" on the big screen and haven't got the ability to imagine the experience. Some blame must be placed on the advent of home video, which has removed the cinematic experience from the theater and placed it in the uncloistered and distraction-laden venue of the home, but mostly I attribute it to unrealistic expectations and a general atrophying of the imagination, attributable somewhat to the tidal wave of in-your-face gore that ""Dawn of the Dead"" helped unleash, but more so to quantum leaps in sfx technology that have seduced filmmakers away from the suggestive to the overt. All I can really tell you is that back in the spring of 1979, after first viewing of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" I had zombie nightmares for weeks. No lie, and I enjoyed every one of them. Quite literally, there had been nothing like it before, not in its disturbing, benighted totality. Herschell Gordon Lewis may have first tapped the vein of overt grue in schlock classics like ""Two Thousand Maniacs!"" and ""Blood Feast"", certainly, while auteurs like Hooper, Carpenter, Wes ""Last House on the Left"" Craven, and Romero himself explored the possibilities of effective indie low-budget frights, but Hollywood had pretty much steered clear of such nasty business, notwithstanding its growing love affair with squibs for bullet wounds (cf. ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""The Wild Bunch,"" and ""Soldier Blue,"" etal.) and its undeniable need to sublimate the rising tide of violence in post-Vietnam, post-civil uprising, post-Watergate America. I'm sorry, but today's spoiled, couch potato audiences have nothing but my sympathies and condolences for their impaired appreciation of cornerstone genre cinema.Any horror fan worthy of the appellation already intimately knows the plot and characters of ""Dawn of the Dead"" inside out, and I won't subject whatever zombie virgins might be reading this to yet another summary of the story. If you're one of them, you can go read someone else's comments. Suffice to say that Romero adapts the only truly effective zombie movie scenario---living survivors attempting to weather out a plague of the implacable, ravenous living dead---to his anti-consumerist theme to once again effectively expound upon human fallibility within when faced with inexorable pressures without.""Dawn of the Dead"" is not without its faults, of course, despite my highly subjective rating of ""10"" here on the IMDb. Only a fool would deny them. The make-up and sfx by Tom ""you have to ask?"" Savini and crew, a benchmark in its day, are certainly dated, though they still play well with Romero's satirical intent, and serve to somewhat soften the sheer repulsiveness of the gruesome violence they depict, a quality that soon disappeared in later Savini projects like ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Maniac,"" and ""The Prowler."" The acting, though nowhere near as bad as some wet-behind-the-ears curmudgeons on this site would have you believe, is occasionally zombie stiff but more than serviceable; Ken ""The Devil's Rejects"" Foree unquestionably has the best acting chops of Romero's quartet of anti-heroes, and has enjoyed a successful B-movie career, but I remain quite fond of the other three as well. Michael ""Day of the Dead"" Gornick's cinematography is unflashy but effective, thanks to Romero's able editing and a screenplay that drops the viewer right smack in the middle of apocalyptic mayhem and confusion.Mostly ignored on this site is the fact that ""Dawn of the Dead"" was one of the first films (if not THE first) to demonstrate that success could be had outside the purview of mainstream distribution channels despite the onus of refusing to submit to the demands of a currently decade-old MPAA. Released unrated (with an advisory that no one under 17 would be admitted due to the violent content), ""Dawn of the Dead"" recouped its production costs on opening weekend and went on to make tens of millions of dollars, for which any horror buff ought to be immensely grateful. In a way, it was the ""Star Wars"" of indie horror movies.I don't expect these comments of mine to change anyone's opinion of the film. Part of the beauty of the filmgoing experience is that it is so highly subjective; one man's meat is another man's poison. So be it. As my judo sensei once told me long ago, some people have eyes but do not see. If just one person who's never seen Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" is motivated to give it a shot because of these comments, I'll count the time and effort composing them well worth the bother. After all, when there's no more room in Hell, the braindead will worship remakes and belittle the originals that made them possible in the first place, and there's just something wrong with that.",Dawn of the Dead
87,fmarkland32,Quite possibly the world's best zombie film.,10,7 November 2006,"Everything starts peacefully until people start craving flesh and so our few survivors take refuge in a nearby mall where they use the commodities of the store to defend themselves, hide and plan a strategy of escape. Never along the way do they(or the audience) figure out how the zombies came to be the way they are. Dawn Of The Dead in many ways can be seen as a political film on how much we depend on commercialism and the like but They Live was far superior in politics, however what Dawn Of The Dead is best at is delivering the visceral carnage as well as creating an atmospheric thriller in which our heroes think and deal with tragic circumstances. Indeed the sequence in which a guy is bitten by a zombie and begs to be shot, is almost heartbreaking. The movie, like The Hitcher, is an exercise in futility and frustration as our heroes can't figure out how to escape or even figure out what the hell is going on. The ending is somewhat upbeat until you figure out that our heroes really have nowhere to run or hide and in doing so the movie earns most of it's mileage from this dilemma.**** out of 4-(Excellent, A Must see!)",Dawn of the Dead

Romero's follow up to the highly successfully masterpiece, ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) (If you haven't read my review of that, click on the link and get yourself across there!). While this film has none of the original characters in it, this sequel ramps up the chaos which was introduced in the first film and shows how the zombie outbreak is affecting the wider world.Brief Plot: A small group of survivors seek refuge in a mall from hordes of the undead.Detailed Plot: A zombie apocalypse has decimated the planet, millions have died and in America the National Guard are on the street working with any enforcement agency available and anybody that can fight against undead flesh-eating zombies. When a clearing out a residential building descends into chaos with a racist officer shooting anybody of a different ethnic origin, Roger and Peter plan an escape with Stephen who works for a TV station. Stephen is Roger's friend and along with his colleague Francine they know the whereabouts of a helicopter that could allow them to leave the madness. Using the helicopter, the four people flee and find a shopping mall that could act as sanctuary for them. While clearing the mall they get reckless and Roger is bitten. Their existence in the consumer heaven will be put to the test when a motorcycle gang also need refuge in the mall. As events unfold the original four do not just have the walking dead to contend with but also angry bikers that want to the treasures that the mall can offer.Wrap Up: If you read my review of ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) you will know that I gave it 10 out of 10. It was a masterpiece of film and it made an impact that changed horror scene and changed me too. In my opinion, the sequel is nothing short of brilliant too. While the horror is still the same and the undead are still the big threat in the film, it was carried off wonderfully and had lots of messages embedded in it, much like the interpretations that could be took from the first film. This film has social commentaries that includes things like consumerism, racism, isolation, the brittleness of society, claustrophobia, mass hysteria, selfishness of man, the collapse of dominant society norms including authority and the family unit, and plenty more that individual audience members can dissect for themselves further. It is hilarious, it is disgusting, it is absurd, it is scary, it is exciting, it is intelligent... it is so much more than just a zombie film.Not the kind of film you should put kids in front of, maybe not the kind of film you watch with your mother either. If you enjoy horror and can put the 70's fashion on the backburner then what you have here is a fantastic film which is owed so much credit and did lots of things to set up modern zombie films - nay, not just zombie films, but horror films that look at desolation and apocalyptic stories, horror that has isolation and confinement, horror that has little to no hope. My friends, I firmly believe in this film and I am more than happy to give this a solid 9 out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead
89,CitizenCaine,Dawn Is Worthy Follow-up To Romero's Night,7,7 June 2004,"George Romero waited ten years to make a follow-up to his highly influential horror debut Night Of The Living Dead. The wait was worth it. Dawn Of The Dead is definitely a worthy follow-up to its predecessor. The film takes a different tact than the first film. It's in color and there's less unrelenting horror than in the first film. There are only four characters this time, making it easy to identify with them. The film follows their plight as they flee to a local shopping mall and barricade themselves in against the mindless intruders, the dead. In turns, the quartet is industrious, full of glee, hope, and despair, as they attempt to decide what to do with themselves in the wake of the dead taking over. The acting is barely any better than the first film, but the focus this time around is on the survivors continuing to problem solve. The film is successful in slowly building tension toward the last half hour. Along the way, there's lots of gore, humor, and sly social commentary. The humor is present throughout the film, while the gore becomes really prevalent when the motorcycle gang arrives. There are lots of good effects and some obviously phony ones too, but few horror films can step as comfortably as this film outside of their genre so easily into the realms of action, humor, social commentary, and suspense. There are several cameos by Romero and company throughout the film. *** of 4 stars.",Dawn of the Dead

Anyway, four people flee a Philadelphia that is rapidly slipping into chaos in a stolen traffic helicopter.  Running low on fuel and food, they land at a large regional mall. It makes such a tempting rest stop they decide to stay for the duration. But first, they must clear the mall of zombies and protect it from renegade biker gangs. This premise, with more that a little tongue in cheek, provides the framework for lots of shooting and other zombie and biker mayhem. All-in-all pretty routine stuff.  Not good, not bad.

91,jluis1984,Romero's Supreme Zombie Monsterpiece!,10,16 January 2006,"Director George Romero took the world by surprise in 1968 with his landmark horror opus, ""Night of the Living Dead"". The eerie atmosphere, the social cometary and the violent gore (for the time) as the images of the dead devouring the living turned it into an instant classic. Ten years later he crafted a far superior film that stands in as a masterpiece of the genre.Continuing the events of ""Night"", in ""Dawn of the Dead"" Romero show us the world after the outburst of the living dead problem. While the authorities are in chaos questioning what to do, Stephen (David Emge), a helicopter pilot and his friend Roger (Scott H. Reininger), a SWAT member, decide to escape and fly towards Canada. Stephen brings his pregnant girlfriend Francine (Gaylen Ross) and Roger brings up another SWAT member, Peter (Ken Foree). The four of them manage to escape but decide to hide in a shopping mall before making the trip to Canada.The movie is simply outstanding, even when it is considerably less scary and less atmospheric than its predecessor; it still delivers good moments of tension and suspense as the group explores the zombie-infested mall, and although it goes on a more action-oriented direction (something the 2004 remake would explore further), the movie flows slowly, setting carefully the mood and more important, making us, the audience, care and feel identify by the characters.The characters, that has always been Romero's trademark with his ""Dead"" films; the characters always are very realistic, and give that realism to the fantastic situation they are. However, this is not a serious character study, Romero has filled the movie with great amounts of gore and violence, but not in a nasty way, as he has stated himself, the gore in ""Dawn of the Dead"" is far from the realistic approach of ""Night"" and it is more akin to comic book violence. That is one of the most remarkable features of the film, it walks the fine line between serious scary realism and a fun cartoon-like violence.The SFX may not be very surprising in this days, but they were outstanding in its time. Make-up master Tom Savini managed to do things that did not exist before and practically invented effects during the making of the movie.The acting is probably the weakest part of the movie, nevertheless, Ken Foree shines in his role and steals every scene he is in. He is truly an underrated actor.The script is awesome, almost flawless. While it has a few noticeable plot holes, it remains consistent and believable in its fantastic universe, including Romero's satire of modern consumerism that never feels forced or overwhelming (like it was in his recent ""Land of the Dead""). It is a dark trip to human nature spiced with a good dose of dark humor.While probably Romero never reached again the perfection of this film, he will be always remembered as a director who always tries to give more than a horror movie. 10/10.

It is been almost 40 years anniversary now since this movie come out. Night of the Living Dead was George A. Romero's first film that really introduced the zombie genre, but this to me really started the zombie praise. This in my opinion is one of the best zombie movies of all time. It is my number 1 favorite zombie movie I love this movie to death and it is one of my personal favorite horror films of all time. This movie is based on a Zombie apocalypse this group find's them self's with this pilot who takes them with the helicopter in the air and they find a shopping mall. There is a perfect place to go in to a ""Zombie Apocalypse."" So they go in to shopping mall and they have every single item in that shopping mall after disposal to use on the zombies. As you can tell it is a very fun movie but more important this movie inspires zombies. Without this movie there wouldn't have been The Walking Dead there wouldn't be 28 Days Later there wouldn't have been any of that. This movie is very important this days it was remade in 2004. It is a fun, fun ride I enjoy this film it is entertaining horror flick. Back in the 1978 that come out it was more scary than it is today. This is where I give this movie the most credit, just like... you have a great time watching people murdering zombies. This movie has a great action, great story, plot, great effects the real zombies. It has gore, blood, you se heads been blowing off. George A. Romero's wrote and direct brilliantly this movie. Tom Savini creates a great special effects for the zombies. Great make up, great blood squibs. The film is fast paced it is excellent brilliant. You see all those SWAT team sieging the building shooting the zombies and gunning the down violent gang. You see whole world comes to an end and people shooting zombies even kids are zombies in this movie. The group in the shopping mall has to deal not only with zombies and the disposing them, they also have to deal with poachers who break in to their home and start stealing items and letting zombies in the mall. Tom Savini was one of the motorcycle poachers who was stealing items in the mall. Gaylen Ross was a fantastic babe as Francine news reporter. David Emge as Stephen the pilot was excellent. Ken Foree as Peter a SWAT team member was the best in this movie. Scott H. Reiniger as Roger another SWAT team member was good in his role. They don't make movies like this today anymore. It's a R-rated movie and it is a perfect 10. Dawn of the Dead is one of the best zombie apocalyptic movies of all time, I highly recommend this film to any horror fan.",Dawn of the Dead
93,aesgaard41,Excellent !,10,31 March 2001,"This is a great movie in more ways than one, after all, who wouldn't want to live in the mall and free unlimited access to the whole thing. I don't know how many people would get bored of it after a while, but it could have been made interesting to set up all the mannequins as customers and employees for some amusement once the zombies were locked outside. Why they didn't think ahead to rip out the starter mechanisms to keep the trucks from being moved is a mystery to me. The theories and reasons as to why the dead are walking is a little too preachy for me, as to why they had to kill off two of the people living in the mall. Dumping the dead zombies in the mall freezer was a little out of left field; why not hurl them off the roof to feed their friends. Some of the actors playing the zombies seem to be hamming up their roles, though, the nurse zombie at one point becoming seen in almost every scene. In fact, this movie starts looking for an end just as it begins to become tedious, so the creators throw in bikers as looters to come in and ruin paradise( should have disabled the trucks when you had the chance!). They trash the place as you know they will and spoilers withheld, the whole thing is over before you know it.

Isn't the price for choosing either path just as high, and is either choice worth it?Leave it to the Master of blending horror with satirical social commentary, George A. Romero, to slip these and other juicy subversive bits underneath the flaky crust of flaky, rotting, shambling undead corpses, so that we could all hungrily gobble down the pleasingly putrid ""magnum opus"" pastry known now and forever as the Granddaddy of Zombie Flicks, DAWN OF THE DEAD.Having tackled (knowingly or not) the horrors of war and the struggle between race and class in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, he picks up almost exactly where he left off. The countryside is becoming virtually overrun with the walking dead, civil unrest is the order of the day and the infrastructure of federal and state governments and the military is rapidly falling apart. Through coincidence and some pretty harrowing circumstances, four people (Ken Foree, David Emge, Scott Reiniger and Gaylen Ross) come together and seek refuge in the last stronghold they can find for protection against the zombie masses...a local shopping mall.If it weren't for the assist by Romero fan and collaborator (and no slouch himself in the genre) Dario Argento, DAWN would still be famous - and infamous - as the film that introduced the world to the amazing work of Tom Savini. Up until now, Dick Smith was hailed as the King of All Makeup Effects, though 'young' upstarts like Rick Baker, Greg Cannom, Kevin Yagher and Steve Johnson were gaining momentum. But Tom, using ingenuity and guts (his and everybody else's) put a WOW factor into the zombie horror genre as never before. And not without help. This movie was also literally the place where KNB Studios was born, as well as the proving ground for many other talented big names in FX, who began their study under Savini.And a lot of fans bitch and complain about the slow pacing of the second act. I STRONGLY disagree. DAWN especially is a movie that should take the time to allow us to get to know the characters better, and I'm glad it did. There are no Oscar-worthy performances here, but everyone does a pretty damn good job, (especially Foree, who draws favorable comparisons to a horror 'homie,' Tony ""Candyman"" Todd, who took the lead role in the remake of NOTLD.)A horror movie without character development is simply a gore-fest with music, nothing more. There are times when those kinds of films can be entertaining, and that's fine. But any horror junkie worth his weight in severed, crawling limbs enjoys a great flick with gore, a wicked sense of humor AND some intelligence. DAWN offers more than enough of all three to satisfy drooling dismemberment devotees, and even fearful fans who feel faint at the sight of a paper cut.",Dawn of the Dead

This is a zombie film after all!The shopping centre provides plenty of amenities and consumables for our consumer filled society and provides a great locale in terms of originality for some great horror action.Action in terms of gore, blood effects and ingenuity as the four blockade themselves in from a horde of zombies and bikers.There are even moments of black comedy as we see zombies been decapitated, hit and try and walk up elevators travelling in the opposite direction.The film does provide a social commentary of modern society and its greedy, consumption and shopping habits in general!I had to compare the zombies in the shopping centre to actual shoppers in comparable malls.Suspenseful, action filled with low budget but good special effects made in an aged error.

Romero, Screenplay George A. Romero.""When there's no more room in Hell, the dead shall walk the earth""....When Director George A. Romero's 1968 ""Night Of The Living Dead"" was released in theaters across America, the horror film genre entered a bold new phase. Not only was this the first horror film to graphically depict zombies eating human flesh, but its powerful cinematography (the whole film was made to look like someone caught the whole massacre on videotape) ushered in mainstream horror films which are still popular today. In 1978, a whole ten years after ""Night of the Living Dead"", Romero released the sequel. ""Dawn"" picks up where ""Night"" ends. The zombies have spread like wildfire and the few remaining living humans must fight them as best they can. The principal characters- Stephen, Roger, Francine and Peter (David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger, Gaylen Ross) spend most of the film battling the zombies while trapped in a shopping mall. It has been said that much of the mall scenes suggest a social comment about society's excessive consumption of material goods. Frankly, this message is too subtle to be understood by most viewers or was simply an interesting perspective which arose when certain critics over analyzed the film. In this vein, Romero seems to be saying that today's society turns people into zombies in a gradual, unconscious manner. TV ads which advertise clothing and gifts, store windows with apparel and bags which entice the passing pedestrians- each contribute to making us zombie-like as we head to the malls. The light, comedic music which fills the mall scenes also suggest this is not merely a horror film, especially when compared to the darker, more intense music at the beginning of the film when the zombies first break out. This music is provided by a now extinct group called ""Goblin"". The degree of violence is tame by today's horror film standards. This film was seen in theaters as late as midnight. In '78, it was enough horror to see zombies chewing on human flesh, even though the zombies look like people in various Halloween costumes, including a nurse zombie, a nun zombie, a Hairy Krishna zombie and middle-class-looking zombies. Either this is pure camp and cheesy, B horror film stuff or yet another social message- the zombies are simply human underneath seeking to be alive and normal again, envying the living for their ability to enjoy life. The mall, for example, is where they assemble because they miss shopping. The film is a treasure of classic horror, a film which was ahead of its time in the late 70's. While not as interesting or as good as ""Night of the Living Dead"" which Romero acknowledges as his masterpiece, ""Dawn of the Dead"" is a strong film in its own right. This film subsequently inspired other zombie films in the 1980's and the more commercial, mainstream horror films which also included their own brand of social commentary/comedy. It is, interestingly enough, a film that is best enjoyed at night. The film feels rather long but the action of the film is non-stop and exciting, so even the youngest viewer will not have trouble following the plot. None of the actors are very famous but look for George Romero in a small role as a film director on television.",Dawn of the Dead

98,virek213,The Ultimate Undead Epic Of The 70s,8,16 October 2010,"In 1968, George Romero for all intents and purposes invented the first modern zombie movie with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, hence creating an entire sub-genre within the horror genre. Ten years later, he took things many steps further with DAWN OF THE DEAD. And whereas with the original he managed to create a landmark horror film on a budget that would barely cover the typical catering costs on most Hollywood films, here he had $2 million at his disposal.In this film, the zombie epidemic has been accelerated to where all the big cities, Philadelphia included, are being overrun by the undead. David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross are the quartet who manage to escape the hellhole of Philly and go on the run in a chopper, refueling along the way and, naturally enough, having to exterminate dozens of zombies. They end up touching down at a huge shopping mall and find what becomes a gold mine for them, but again they're dealing with the basic problem of all the undead. In taking over the mall and keeping the flesh-eating ghouls mostly outside, they seem to have it all. But the reality and the horror come back to literally bite them when a motorcycle gang that has managed to survive through the zombie plague shatters their existence.In contrast to the claustrophobic intensity and paranoia of the original, which was influenced by Richard Matheson's classic novel ""I Am Legend"" and Hitchcock's THE BIRDS, DAWN OF THE DEAD is primarily dominated by high-intensity action sequences, as if Romero was channeling directors like Sam Peckinpah (sans the slow-motion montage editing), Walter Hill, or William Friedkin. There are some documentary-like sequences of Pennsylvania rednecks in the countryside hunting down zombies; a sort of scathing satire on the media's obsession with ratings during a zombie epidemic (the station manager wants a list of rescue stations continuously on the air, even though many of them have long since closed down); and, in the mall, a warped depiction of America's obsession with consumerism. The zombies, of course, are slow-moving, easily making them a target for comic sequences as well. But that hardly means Romero isn't thinking of horror, far from it. Thanks to the genius of make-up maestro Tom Savini (who also plays one of the bikers), there is an extreme amount of blood and guts that gets splattered all over (the film was released without an MPAA rating, which would have been an 'X' had it been submitted for one, but it still made off with a huge monetary haul). Even the ending itself, though more ""optimistic"" than the original, is decidedly ambiguous.There's no way of avoiding the fact that this is an extremely violent, brutal, and gory film. But as both a satire of how thin the line between consumerism and zombieism is, and as a well-choreographed combination of action and horror, DAWN OF THE DEAD remains a knock-out. Just have a strong stomach.",Dawn of the Dead
99,the red duchess,Astonishing and ambitious satire; one of the great films of the 1970s.,9,10 January 2001,"'Dawn of the dead' may lack the pulverising immediacy of 'Night of the Living Dead', but it gains in exhilirating, epic scope.  It is one of the best films of the 1970s, a reckless, hubristic, over-ambitious masterpiece whose excess is reined in by its Langian formal precision.  The claustrophobia of the first film is replaced by a wider frame of reference, including the media, the military and suburbia; although, typically, the move is once again towards the indoors.The film starts explosively, inside a panicking TV station trying to report on the inexplicable emergence from the earth of the undead.  An assorted quartet - two media, two army; three white, one black; three men, one woman - escape in a helicopter used for rush-hour traffic reports.  There is a sense of relief in this, a sense of breaking free from the circle of undead enclosing America's major cities.But not for long - it seems that modern American man, unlike his pioneering ancestors, cannot stand open spaces, and holes up in a building, a shoppingmall, which is crawling with zombies, and recognised by the woman as a prison.  Not content with this level of confinement, our heroes draw plans, erect barriers, shut down grids.  Romero pinpoints this national insularity by framing his modern horror movie as a transposed Western, with the foursome as latterday frontiersmen wiping out the natives, and erecting a new civilisation.Some might say that Romero's irony is a little heavy here - the mock-triumphal Western music on the soundtrack; the composition of the four at the height of the crisis standing in front of a sign with just the letters 'U' and 'S' visible; the glee in the gun culture, including an ersatz Western gun store in the mall the 'Red River' like beseiging  of the mall by the 'Indian' Hells' Angels on their motorbike/horses complete with tomahawks.  But such irony is never stable - Romero keeps pulling the ground from under the viewers' feet, both in terms of character identification, and the shifting meanings embodied by the zombies.Romero's terrifying vision is of an America turned in on itself, eating itself through cannibalistic greed, the very system of capitalism based on a cycle of power and repression in which the repressed will never quite go away.  'Night' pulsated with a late 1960s urgency reflecting contemporary social and political upheaval, white capitalist America beseiged by the peoples it had oppressed for centuries.  By 1978, that political anger is gone, and America has reverted to being a race of consumer zombies, congregating around massive shopping malls like they're the religious temples of the Incas, trapped there not by the freedom of choice of capitalist propaganda, but mindless instinct.the zombies are supposed to be the enemy, the Other in conventional horror terms, but the first thing the so-called heroes do on landing at the mall is substitute urgent survival for gleeful consumerism (compare with the very similar silent fantasy, 'Paris Qui Dort').  There's no way to deal with any outside threat because we are numbed and bloated by products.  Reality ceases to exist; there are some beautifully surreal scenes, as our heroes make homes in showrooms.The mall sequence as a whole has a Bunuellian savagery about it, and the film builds up an aggression like the characters until all is chaos - tones, modes, genres all colliding, the 'reality' or 'integrity' or, even, 'seriousness' of the film as much in question as the modern world the protagonists live in, where even time seems to stand still, the weeks of the action compressed into the framework of a day, with the night of the living dead giving onto the dawn.  It is probably allegorically significant which characters survive, but by the end we're not sure whether we're watching a horror, a comedy, a thriller, a Western, or a very bitter joke.  Certainly scarier than 'The Stepford Wives'",Dawn of the Dead
100,gigan-92,"""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.""",10,4 January 2012,"A+This is a movie I recommend to not just horror fans, but to all fans of cinema. The film, a more or less direct sequel to the original '68 film ""Night of the Living Dead"", is jaw dropping in its epic scale of story-telling. George A. Romero creates a true dystopia, a world that is terrifying not just because of the zombies that inhabit it but the savage people and constant denominator of social isolation as well. The chaos that envelops the world seems all-too convincing, and it is utterly shocking to watch.The media, the organized forces, and of course the rampant shopping/materialism is all subtly critiqued here. One of my favorite sequences in the film is the very similar 'cleansing of the ghettos', where martial law is in effect. The tight-framing and in-your-face gore makes the scene truly bold and attention drawing. The score is dark, energetic and definitely one of my favorites. The make-up and gore are just awesome. It cements the film as a true zombie and horror film landmark, and few films to this day have even come close to its greatness and intricateness. Ken Foree is a film BAD-ASS, and he's a suitable Duane Jones successor in a sense. David Emge, Scott Reiniger and Gaylen Ross are all just fantastic, which in itself to me is a statement about how Hollywood tries to dictate the industry by saying you need Brad Pitt (nothing personal)to have a solid critical and financial success. But here are these 'no name' actor and actresses serving incredible performances. They have comic elements, fear and a true sense of inner doom. Think about the flow of the events of the movie, how these characters find essentially a secure paradise (practically biblical if you compare the two)and yet they feel in-content. Its subtle and masterful film-making. And hell yeah, Tom Savini also orchestrates the awesome effects and is pretty enjoyable on screen, with this odd energy. No wonder he cameos in the ""Dusk Till Dawn"". It stands as a chilling image to what the end of the human race might just look like.",Dawn of the Dead
101,jp_91,Masterpiece!,10,6 April 2020,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is a cult classic, a great zombie frick about human survival and team work, also about humans against humans trying to win everything, the people is a worst thing than a dead one.

102,Bababooe,"Cheap, Amateur Acting, Story and Makeup, Joke Zombies. Night was Great, Day was Good, Dawn is Sad!",1,27 April 2017,"Cheap, Amateur Acting, Story and Makeup, Joke Zombies. Night was Great, Day was Good, Dawn is Sad. I first saw Dawn at a midnight showing at a local theater in the 80s, and was knocked out by the guts and shock.I've seen it a few times after, last viewing in 2016. I've seen the remake a couple of times and it's better. Nothing beats the first, Night of the Living Dead, low budget but tons of atmosphere and fright.The best part of Dawn is the beginning, with the TV station and the SWAT team raid. TV station, confusion, SWAT team best part is when the zombie husband bites the non zombie wife. There was also some guts at the end with the motorcycle gang. There was a few other moments here and there, but that's it.Here's the problem: The acting is garbage, these people cannot act, and had no business in front of the camera. The zombie effects, which were blue/gray paint here and there, full on garbage. The script, started out great with the TV station and the SWAT team raid, then we get a tour of zombie comedy with the rednecks killing zombies in the field, and the mall. The MALL. Pie in the zombie face. This was not good.Is this a comedy or a horror? Make up your mind. Night was a horror, we got it. Day was horror, and some comedy which hurt it immensely. Dawn was a comedy horror, which sucked.Here's the worst part of the movie: When the black guy decides he does not want to escape with the white chick (makes no sense), he proceeds to barricade himself in a room and wait for the zombies to break in so he can commit suicide, then at the last minute he changes his mind (I guess I'll go with the white chick) and escapes from the zombies and makes it to the helicopter to escape with the chick. Now this is full on garbage. I don't care what came before. The intro, Night. I don't care if this guy George Romero solved world peace. Judge this by the movie he's made. If you want atmosphere and gore, here's a hint, Fulci! Messiah of Evil, White Zombie. This is a student production with a budget. My rating is a C, for a B movie, 3 or 4 stars. Given it now has 8 rating, I must compensate with a 1. Better luck next time.",Dawn of the Dead

A group of surviving humans (Ken Foree, Gaylen Ross, Scott H.

This is a brilliant follow-up to George Romero's masterpiece ""Night of the Living Dead"" and almost surpasses it by a mile. The film is chock filled with memorable gore and make-up effects by Tom Savini, action and has a killer soundtrack by producer/composer Dario Argento, sure the acting is kind of low budget style but all the stuff i mentioned makes up for that. The film does offer some nice social satire about consumerism and how it falls due to it, it's truly one of the best horror movies of all time and one of my all time favorites.Often imitated mainly by Europeans but never equaled, this is a movie that belongs in any horror fan's collection of movies.",Dawn of the Dead
104,LoneWolfAndCub,Great Sequel That's Now THE Zombie Movie,10,24 August 2005,"Dawn Of The Dead is a follow up to George A. Romero's Night Of The Living Dead. While Night is ultimately scarier and better Dawn is known as THE zombie movie.This Dead movie is about four people who lock themselves up in a huge mall that is overrun by the living dead. They lock themselves up on the highest level and make a living there. That's all there is to the plot. Dawn is great to watch. The action sequences are great, the acting and dialogue good and the gore very high. Tom Savini did a magnificent job on this, performing stunts and doing all the gory effects.This is definitely not for the squeamish, the gore is real and sick. But the scariest thing in this movie is looking at civilisation deteriorating into nothing. It is a must see for horror fans everywhere.5/5",Dawn of the Dead
105,thejcowboy22,Zombies always do their Christmas shopping early,6,25 January 2019,"After watching a bunch of colorless ""Chick Flicks"" the past few seasons during the ugly decade known as the ""SEVENTIES"", I thought it would be a nice change if I suggested a movie to go see with my Ex- wife. My Ex- wife hates horror movies and I told her I want to see ""Dawn of The Dead"". She predictably said ""No way I'm going to see that trashy horror film featuring cannibalism!"" It was a hot summer evening and I dragged her to the theater. Oh by the way, earlier My Ex and I watched together the original Night Of The Living Dead. She basically was indifferent after viewing. For someone who loathes the (cinema of the macabre) In my opinion she took the film quite well. How bad could the sequel be? The movie begins with two Philadelphia news reporters, Stephen (David Emge) and Francine (Gaylen Ross) plotting to steal their station's traffic copter to escape the growing Zombie Apocalypse. Meanwhile in another part of town a police SWAT team raids a housing project. The defiant occupants are being raided because they violated Marshall law. The tenants fire back at the swat team with weapons of their own. The occupants disobeyed Marshall law due to harboring their dead love one in the basement. The disgusting visual of the caged zombies eating body parts was too much for my Ex as she said, ""Let's go!"" among st the sudden rapid fire of guns by the both sides. I wanted to stay as the action picked up but my Ex and I bickered as an angry audience started to show their opinion by telling us to ""Shut Up!"" My obstinate Spouse stormed out of the theater but I stayed on to watch. Not since the movie Planet of the Apes have I watched a movie alone in a theater. As I settled back in my seat, Two Swat members team together and by fate team up with the two reporters and set out in a helicopter heading west toward Pittsburgh. The foursome land and refuel with some unexpected interference by zombie kids. All I can tell you is that scene earned this film it's ""R"" rating. Subsequently the quartet journey onward and end up at a shopping mall. The mall is infested with the walking dead another words Zombies and consumerism what a novel idea.. Little by little our four characters clean house and take over the mall as their living quarters. In my opinion I truly believe this was the hook that made this movie attractive to most. They have the finest beds to sleep on. Plenty of food courtesy of HIckory Farms ,""MANGA"" and an ice skating rink Francine uses during the movie. The music during the film was surprisingly well suited for our decrepit creatures. George Romero creativity in my opinion rose to another level as Zombies and shopping malls are a perfect marriage in this twisted horror comedy. Hey let's throw in some Hell's Angel's bikers to spice up things. My 7 year daughter was so intrigued by this movie, she watched it numerous times on DVD. What's next?

Romero makes not only a terrific horror picture, but a clever social commentary with this film as he compares the zombies to the every-day shopper! He well-laces this film with action, humor, emotion, and an effective sense of adventure even in the face of such grueling terrors. Makeup artist Tom Savini does some of his most memorable work in this film, creating some unforgettably stomach-churning gore. I swear I couldn't eat my breakfast the morning after I first saw this film!! The band Goblin provides a weird, but very appropriate music score.

109,nickenchuggets,"""Those things out there are everywhere""",8,14 October 2021,"Although George Romero's Night of the Living Dead is often hailed as one of the best horror movies ever, he waited almost a decade before releasing a sequel in 1978. NOTLD is famous today mainly because of the pioneering effects it had on the horror genre in regards to zombies. The film was arguably the first zombie movie to have zombies that actually looked and acted the part, basically a horde of undead, skin-eating monsters who can only be killed by destroying their brains. Romero was the first person to introduce zombies in this manner and launch them into the mainstream. The zombies may not be able to think intelligently, but what they lack in smarts they make up for in numbers, and that's what makes them scary. This is something that was shown to us in the first film. The longer the bloodbath drags on, the more people are infected. Dawn of the Dead takes this to a new level, now telling us that zombies have taken over the whole United States. In fact, this movie takes place only days after the events of the first one. The zombies are out of control, and the settings are huge compared to the measly little house of the first movie. The movie begins with Stephen Andrews, a man from Philadelphia who plans to escape with his pregnant girlfriend Francine in a stolen helicopter. In the same area, a cop named Roger is leading a team of officers on an assault on an apartment complex located in a low-income neighborhood. Many of the tenants are turned into zombies and killed by Roger and his friend, Peter Washington. Eventually, Roger, Peter, Francine and Stephen meet up together and travel in the stolen helicopter to an abandoned shopping mall swarming with zombies. Initially, this place appears to be a safe haven for zombie survivors because it's large and contains all types of food, medicine, and other necessities, but things get difficult quickly. While trying to move semi trucks in front of the entrances to block the zombies, Roger is attacked by one. Peter knows many people bitten by the zombies and none have ever lived longer than 3 days. One day, while the rest of the group is trying to listen to news reports about the apocalypse they're now in, Roger dies and comes back as a zombie. Peter is forced to kill what used to be his friend. Meanwhile, Stephen asks Francine to marry him, but she declines as of right now because she knows surviving is more important. Stephen also shows her how to fly the helicopter, just in case the group manages to escape. Later on, a group of bikers discover the mall is being used by the survivors as a safe house from zombies, so they decide to force their way in with heavy weapons like shotguns and rifles. Stephen eventually gets shot by one of them while trying to hide in an elevator shaft, and zombies flood the elevator he's in, infecting him. The bikers eventually leave, and many are overwhelmed by the sheer number of zombies in the process. The horde makes its way up the stairs to the penultimate floor of the mall, where Peter and Francine are the only survivors left. Peter tells Francine to leave him behind as he tries to fight off the zombies. He considers shooting himself, but then decides to make a run up the roof ladder and into the helicopter. The aircraft flies into the distance, and we'll never know what happened to them afterwards. When compared to its predecessor, I feel that Dawn of the Dead is an inferior but still enjoyable movie. It's extremely gory, and more attention is draw to the violence because it's now in color. The original movie was violent as well, but it looks more vibrant here. The zombies are shot in the head, decapitated, and eviscerated countless times, and it reminds you how the first movie didn't need to show much killing to be creepy. I wouldn't really single out any character as being the main one, as there are 4 survivors (at first), but only 2 are skilled enough to live to the end of the movie. Interestingly, Tom Savini did the gore effects for this movie, and he also worked on Friday the 13th. Unsurprisingly, the MPAA gave this movie an X rating because his work was a little too brutal. Zombie movies don't really scare me, but they make entertaining adversaries because you don't feel guilty for killing them. Dawn of the Dead shows how even big and open areas like malls are full of hazards at a time when the dead walk the earth. As I've said before, without Romero, the zombie genre might not even be around today.",Dawn of the Dead
110,ethanbresnett,Incredible!,8,2 September 2021,"Considering this film is over 40 years old and there have been so many zombie films/shows since then, it's remarkable that very few have come close to replicating this masterpiece.After a bit of a slow start this film really finds its feet with such a great concept. I think we've all probably wondered what it would be like to have the run of a shopping mall and do what we want, and this film plays out that scenario gloriously, only the shopping spree is interspersed with zombie killing.It has a great plot, with its focus on a small group of characters whom we get to know and root for. It perhaps feels a tad long in parts but this is a very minor criticism really.The zombie makeup has definitely aged, but this is what gives the film an extra amount of charm. In terms of action there's so much good stuff, enough to satisfy those who love a bit of gore.One of the main reasons this film is brilliant is that it injects so much fun into it. Surprising really given the scenario, but it makes it such an enjoyable film. Whereas Night of the Living Dead was much darker and despondent, Dawn of the Dead has a much more vibrant and energetic feel which is very refreshing for the genre.This film is an absolute must for any zombie fans. After watching so many different zombie films over the years and finally now watching Romero's work, it's astounding the influence he's had on the genre.In my opinion this might well be the zombie film of all zombie films!",Dawn of the Dead

Once there they must fight their inner demons as well as zombies and other people looking to take what they have claimed.I saw this movie when I was quite young, like early teens, and I remember riding my bike with my best friend and discussing how epicly cool it would be if this happened in real life. We spent many a day scheming as to how exactly we would claim the local mall for ourselves. I still feel the same sense of awe and wonder when I re-watch this movie today. Romero hit the mater stroke with this movie, in tone and in pacing. Even the special effects are not too terrible when compared to those of today.

112,domino1003,The One and Only Dawn of The Dead,10,7 August 2005,"After watching the remake of this film, I had to sit down and watch this film again. I have avoided watching this for a while because it spooks the hell out of me. However, this time I could handle it a little better (Only because I watched it during the day).Anyhow, the 1978 version focuses on 4 characters. In the first moments of the film you meet Francine (Gaylen Ross), who works at a television station that is trying to keep the general public aware of what's going on. Unfortunately, judging from the chaos in front of and behind the camera, things are pretty much going to hell. There is an outbreak in which the dead are coming back to life and eating the living. Her boyfriend Stephen (David Emge)tells her that they have to leave and that he has a helicopter set for takeoff.Meanwhile, their friend Roger (Scott H. Reiniger)is working SWAT duty, trying to take control of an apartment building. Things seem to be going haywire here, too: they are trying to uphold the law when the law clearly doesn't exist in this situation. Some of the cops shoot anything that moves, and the zombies are taking over the building. It's during this mess that Roger meets Peter (Ken Foree)and invites him to come with him.Soon, the four of them are airborne, searching for a place to land. One time during a fuel stop, they almost get killed by either the undead or each other. Tired and frustrated, they spot a place to stay: A shopping mall. Unfortunately, they still have to deal with the zombies that are inside and outside.The film theme is basically society consumerism. Every person (or zombie)is in NEED of something in this film. The living wants shelter, food, comfort. In a way, the zombie wants the same thing: they want to go inside. Even though the main reason for wanting in could be the 4 walking human dinners, the main reason is that this is where they use to go. A place to meet, eat and shop. And even with the doors blocked and locked, they STILL want to get inside. The 4 living inside have the power to have what they want, but it soon becomes too much.It is not until the end, when the motorcycle gang invades the mall when you see how too much consumerism is a bad thing. Stephen is angry not because of the zombies coming back into the mall, but the fact that intruders are trying to take what he considers his. It is greed that will kill most of the people during the final battle.Despite the film's age, the gore still holds up a bit (Courtesy of the legendary Tom Savini, who plays one of the gang members). For those who haven't seen this yet, then this is a must have in your collection, and skip the remake.One more thing of note: this is the film when the zombies start showing signs of intelligence. It is small at first, but very noticeable. This is a theme that carries through ""Day of The Dead,"" and ""Land of The Dead.""",Dawn of the Dead
113,Rautus,A zombie masterpiece,10,29 July 2007,"Dawn of the Dead is one of my favourite Zombie movies, George A. Romero did a outstanding job with this film and it's one of his masterpieces. The film takes place some time after Night of the Living Dead and the zombies are increasing and taking over more places, a Air traffic reporter Stephan and his executive girlfriend Fran decide to escape using the helicopter while at a building the Police have the place surrounded and soon the SWAT team move in. One of the SWAT Wille goes berserk and starts killing civilians so he's gunned down by Peter, another SWAT member. Roger a fellow SWAT member meets with Peter and they decide to leave the city. Stephan and Fran wait for Roger, Stephan goes inside the building and meets some Police officers that are also running, Roger and Peter arrive and they go off into their helicopter while the officers go off in the boat. The next day they land for fuel while the locals are hunting down the zombies with the help of the army, after encountering some of the zombies they go off into the helicopter again, they soon come across a huge Mega mall and decide to land to check it out. Discovering a storage area they stay their, Peter and Roger go into the mall to see what's down there while Fran stays with Stephan who's fast asleep, dodging the zombies while checking through the mall they get trapped inside one part of it. Stephan takes the Rifle and goes to find them, after encountering a zombie he goes into the mall section and hurries to Roger and Peter. Using a diversion they quickly escape past the zombies while one of the zombies walks off where the storage area is and soon Fran is attacked by him but as it's about to get her they come in and get rid of him. While Fran is in the bedroom the others decide to stay here since they have everything they need, Stephan then tells them that Fran is pregnant but they still want to stay. Stephan goes to Fran and she tells them that she doesn't want to stay here but Stephan explains to her that they've got it good here and should stay. The next day they make a plan to block the zombies from getting in and that's by driving the trucks near by and block the entrances, Roger and Peter go to drive the trucks while Stephan observes them from the helicopter and Fran covers them from the roof. Roger starts to fool around by shooting the zombies and running them over, and on their way to get another truck he leaves his bag with the zombies so they must go there again and get it but when trying to get in a zombie bites a chunk out of his leg, after blocking all the entrances they bandage up his wounds and they come up with a plan to cover the stairway with a fake wall so that the zombies and intruders won't know where it is and after doing that they need to eliminate all the zombies so they can move around with ease so going into the gun store they take a handful of weapons and shoot every zombie in the mall and lock all the door from the inside, once that's done the mall is safe but Roger is slowly changing into a zombie because of the bite. They put all the zombies away and the mall is theirs. They take the money from the bank in case they may need it, they get food from the stores, they have fun in the arcades, the ice rink, take clothes from the clothe store and various other things. The storage room is soon made into a huge fancy apartment full of things from the mall, when Peter is Roger he soon becomes a zombie and Peter has no choice but to shoot him. Fran wants Stephan to teach her how to fly the helicopter in case something happens and he gets injured and they need to escape. A while after teaching her how to fly the helicopter a gang of people discover the mall what they've done with it and decide to take it for themselves but they need all of them, so that night they enter the mall and go to take everything while letting the zombies get in. They go around killing the zombies and taking the stuff while Stephan and Peter take the guns and go to stop them. Trying to stop them Stephan gets chased by them and quickly hides in the elevator and climbs onto the top but one of them shoots up at the top and a bullets hit him in the arm, climbing down he gets surrounded by zombies and bitten by them. He gets them out and shuts the elevator door but when after a while he comes out as a zombie while Peter shoots some of them and they retreat leaving the mall but some of them get eaten by the zombies. Peter returns to Fran and tells her to go without him, zombie Stephan shows up and he shoots him in the head. Fran goes to the helicopter and gets ready to leave while Peter sits in the bedroom with the gun to his head ready to pull the trigger but instead he doesn't and shoots a zombie in the head then he runs out the bedroom and climbs out then quickly runs up to the helicopter and gets in then they fly off leaving the mall going to find another place to go.

114,willcundallreview,A zombie flick with fun to be had,7,15 February 2015,"Rating-7/10Dawn of the Dead is a zombie horror movie which although now would be seen as rubbish effects and editing, is still wildly entertaining and very engaging. I felt the movie does start slowly and the plot takes just a little bit of time to get going, the beginning I may add does harm my overall grade of this film. Made in the 1970's you can't expect great things although away from what people say about it's messages on consumerism etc of the day, it is thrilling and oddly funny at certain times.I can't say the movie is directed or written so well by George A. Romero but what I will say is it is a good idea and one that works very well for those who enjoy a good thrill. The script isn't very tight and although as with the rest of the movie it gets gradually better, it starts off horribly and you do start to wonder if this is as good as some say it is. Staying on the technical side of things the editing is rather poor and although not terrible, some moments just seem too funny even in serious moments.I liked the actors involved and those such as Ken Foree and David Emge are good in there roles and never harm the movie in much ways. I liked the characters they portrayed too and the main cast who you will see are likable and a nice team of people to watch doing there thing. The zombies themselves are pretty awful, I mean the make up more than anything because they just look like they have suffocated and got up but still blue in the face, I mean even in this decade it was set in, you'd think good make up wasn't invented yet.I enjoyed mostly through the middle to end part and I liked the way the movie doesn't just hang around one moment, there are many parts which can be enjoyed as well as thrill and possibly(although not likely) scare you. I think the way some of the zombies die is just ridiculous and Tom Savini although probably knew he was going over the top, nevertheless creates death scenes to be laughed at and re winded back again and again to see just how funny a zombie dying is.I have to say the funny side is explored quite a bit throughout and leaving aside the laughter of seeing a zombie die, Romero seems to bring in moments of comedy and quite random bits of that. Without spoiling it, certain things happen at the end of the film and seeing everything that goes on with these moments is pretty hilarious and kind of surreal to see after all that has gone on within the plot previously.I very much also enjoyed the score for the movie, although starting off yet again not well, as it goes along it not only becomes catchy but also fun and again not like what was going on previously in the film. There is a fun factor to this movie and you can really see that no one truly made this with the up most seriousness because a little light hearted fun within it is just good for the story.Overall I felt it to be Just about a good movie and although starting off fairly slow it starts to get going and draws you in. I expected more from this in truth more in the fact people call this a classic of horror but nevertheless it is fun and thrilling and couldn't recommend it more to both seasoned zombie movie fans and those who have completely never see any.",Dawn of the Dead
115,hokeybutt,Quite Simply... The Pinnacle of Zombie Flicks,10,21 November 2004,"DAWN OF THE DEAD (5 outta 5 stars)Quite simply, the best, most original, most inventive, most suspenseful, most philosophical and the bloodiest zombie movie ever.(Really, there is nothing NEW that could be done to a human or zombie body that isn't done in this movie... just variations on what has been done in DOTD.) Much as I liked the recent remake, it doesn't even come close to achieving the sense of astonishment I experienced the first time I saw this movie. I've seen it about 5 or 6 times now over the years and no matter which version I have seen (the original theatrical cut, the extended cut or the shortened European cut) it still fascinates me. The plot is simple... zombies are taking over the world, people need to flee... but there is nowhere to flee to. They suddenly come up with the idea of barricading themselves inside a full-service shopping mall... everything they could possibly want is there inside... so what need is there to go anywhere else. But the zombies loitering outside won't stay outside forever...",Dawn of the Dead
116,emperor_bender,"Hey, 2 Tall 2 Slow 2...",10,15 February 2008,"This movie was amazing, plain and simple. The actors were great in the roles they were given. It's as if they were living the parts they played. Roger and Peter are 2 of my favorite characters in the whole ""Dead"" series. They make an awesome, funny duo. The beginning was great, and I didn't expect the rest of the movie to keep my interest as well but it did! The biker gang was great, especially the knife/machete wielding Blades (Make-up specialist Tom Savini). For a low-budget horror movie, this was truly one of my favorite movies from start to finish, I was never bored or disappointed watching this. PS- Yes its a sequel, but it easily compares with and possibly passes Night of the Living Dead. 10/10",Dawn of the Dead
117,Gafke,The mall ALWAYS looks like this to me...,10,22 March 2004,"Seeming to pick up right where ""Night of the Living Dead"" left off, ""Dawn of the Dead"" opens with widespread panic and chaos.  The zombie contagion is spreading.  There is nowhere to go.  Civilization, as we know it, is over. As reason collapses and order falls into ruin, four people take off in a helicopter - two SWAT team members, a pregnant woman and her boyfriend.  They don't really know where they're going, but they know they can't stay where they are.  The cities have fallen, and the living are now nothing more than food for the dead.  This is how George Romero's classic film begins, and it only gets better...or worse, as the case may be.As our designated heroes fly out of the city and into the lonely stretches of country beyond, we see redneck zombie hunters having tailgate parties, drinking beer and using the walking dead for target practice.  Utter madness reigns.  Running low on provisions, the foursome spot an abandoned mall. Within, the undead masses shuffle up and down the corridors, blank-faced and empty-eyed.  All they need are cell phones pressed to their ears and they would blend right in with todays mall shoppers.  The foursome, who have nowhere to go in a world gone mad, decide to move in and take over, evicting the zombies and soon becoming every bit as bored and listless as the lifeless patrons, who only came to the mall out of instinct and now remain because of the scent of fresh meat inside.  By the time a gang of vicious bikers show up, determined to take the mall for themselves, the real monsters have already been revealed;they are us, fighting for what is already lost and refusing to give up our hold on the meaningless symbols of structured society.This is an absolutely brilliant film, a hard and bitter (and incredibly funny) comment on the zombies we have all already become, desensitized and superficial.  The zombies fight over body parts the way women fight over wedding dresses at a blow-out sale - there's really no difference at all. The foursome spend much of their time on free shopping sprees, collecting material goods that are no longer worth anything and serve no purpose, and defending a territory that was never theirs to begin with, determined to preserve some sense of order and stability but unable to ignore what is happening just beyond the walls of their stolen home, no matter how hard they try to pretend it's not happening.  Surprisingly more upbeat than most zombie films (thanks in part to the wonderful score by Goblin) ""Dawn of the Dead"" is the best installment in the Living Dead trilogy, not to be missed for any reason by film fans in general and horror fans in particular.  This film bears very little resemblance to the recent remake, sharing only a title and a shopping mall.  The remake is great (IMHO) but it's a completely different movie, in no way comparable to this one. If you've seen the remake, don't think you can skip out on this one.  You'd be missing a lot.  I give this film a flawless 10 star rating.",Dawn of the Dead
118,skybrick736,Dawn of the Dead,9,24 January 2015,"Dawn of the Dead may in fact be the greatest horror sequel of all time even though it really doesn't feel like one. It's easy to see though that Dawn's events seem to take place directly after Night of the Living Dead when the helicopter flies over rural Pennsylvania. The writing and storyline is absolutely there and I love reading into what Romero's underlying message was to the film, about consumerism and its connection to political capitalism. The zombies have terrific makeup and lumbering movements, really well done by the choreographers who set all that up. Plus Tom Savini did excellent masterful work on the gore effects, which I miss today in modern films. As a viewer I was really attached to the four main leads and how they managed to face adversity in the mall. Aside from the dead walking the earth, the atmosphere is very believable and has a strong feeling of dread. Dawn of the Dead is a near horror masterpiece and a great film in general.",Dawn of the Dead
119,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,10,3 March 2005,"The best Zombie movie ever made. Whether you feel that some of the early 'voodoo' zombie films are better, or that European copycats have the edge, or that Raimi's trilogy is superior, it must be said that this is the one that truly started it all, bringing flesh eating to a massive audience. As well as the tonnes of gore and brains being thrown about and chewed on screen, the film has guts and brains of its own- it is a very clever film and (as many have said) a satire on commercialism, and is a brave film given the censorship laws. Such films just are not made anymore.Although the time scale between each of Romero's trilogy continues to be debated, let's just say that Dawn takes place as the world is beginning to realise that the Dead are coming back to life to eat the living, and as the film progresses we see the chaos of reaction. Media tries to tell the story but nobody cares and are concentrating on saving themselves. It soon becomes apparent that this is not going to be a 2 week fad, this may well be the Apocalypse. We get glimpses of scientists trying to work out what we should do, how to survive or adapt, the reason for this, but this is background music-what really matters is finding a safe place while you can. Fran works at a local TV Station which is continuing to present the News. Her boyfriend Stephen, a pilot tells her to meet her later to escape, as someone has to survive. We also meet SWAT team members Peter and Roger who decide to leave after witnessing the true hell of the situation. They are introduced in a fight against both zombies and people in a tenement building and realise that the ordinary people are losing it, and even trained soldiers are failing to cope. They join Stephen (who is at first reluctant) and Fran, and escape to the sky. (Before they leave they meet another group escaping, led by Jo Pilato who would appear in the next instalment. Is he playing the same character her remains to be known, probably not, but interesting anyway).As the four fly and try to work out a plan, we see the world from God's view. In the country, hicks are enjoying blowing away the zombies which ramble onto their land, making a sport out of it. Still people are not seeing the gravity of the situation. Peter kills two zombie kids, and we get another glimpse into humanity. Many moments like this run through the film, where we look at ourselves while we watch. Stephe, now nick-named fly boy shows that he may become a liability if he does not learn one or two rules about gun safety and behaviour. They soon come across a shopping Mall, deciding to stay for the night, refuel and consider their options. However, the Mall has guns, food, everything they could ever want, all for themselves, and appears secure. If they could clean out the zombies inside, and seal the doors so no more could get in, they would have a fortress. They proceed with this plan, against the pregnant Fran's wishes, but the fortress soon becomes a prison. The zombies wait outside, growing in number, TV and Radio broadcasts end, and it soon seems like they are closing themselves in and waiting to die.Dawn loses some of the claustrophobia that Night had, but gains depth and shows very accurately the tedium of the situation. For the first time the zombies seem pathetic, cream pies being rubbed into their face by bikers, and we begin to feel sorry for them. It seems that the human race is finished, and that the survivors are almost selfish-letting the zombies go hungry, stopping them from going where they 'want' to go, and delaying the inevitable. We still do not know why they are here, but that has never been very important- they are here, we must deal. What becomes clear is that the spread will not be contained, and that the human race will be outnumbered very soon. The capitalist themes are effective, the Mall at first makes the viewer smile and dream of the treats waiting inside. But what is left once we get bored? The ending, like the first film leaves us with few answers, and although it is bleak, there is a glint of hope. The survivors may not have much fuel, but they will not give in. Peter changes his mind, fighting against the urge to kill himself, to kill all living and dead intruders, and makes the correct, human decision to leave.Each of the leads give good performances, and after a slow start with some dodgy acting in small parts, we get a true sense of the horror and are sucked in. The absurdity of the situation comes through, in true noir and existential style via, in part the score by Argento's Goblins, and through the behaviour of the humans. We can excuse the zombies for what they do, they are acting on instinct, but when we cannot control ourselves we become something other than human. Peter takes control, helped by a memorable performance by Foree, Flyboy constantly ruins things, but he's only human. Fran fades between strong, independent woman, and accepting, inferior female, and we are left feeling that she, of all the characters has kept her sh*t together. Reinger's performance as Roger is noteworthy, conveying madness and 'the change' brilliantly. Savini is also good, but it is his effects which take central stage at times-extremely bloody, inventive, and not for the weak at heart. If Land of the Dead is anywhere near as good as this, we should be very happy.10 out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead
120,xamtaro,"May have shocked and awed back in its heyday, but not today",5,26 December 2009,"A lot has been said about George A Romero's Dawn of the Dead and its underlying social satire. It is refreshing to find a director who is able to weave in thought provoking social commentary about consumerism into an otherwise brainless genre about slow moving corpses with a taste for human flesh and a quartet of survivors on the run. But social commentary aside, this film offers little more else in the horror genre. In fact, it comes across more of a comedy than a horror.Dawn of the Dead 1978 is Romero's 2nd zombie movie and starts off with the setting of a world in chaos as an unknown epidemic is sweeping the country and reanimating corpses into bloodthirsty flesh eating undead. Through a couple of convenient plot twists, a helicopter pilot Stephan and his news reporter girlfriend Francine meet up with two SWAT team members, Roger and Peter who have abandoned their unit after a failed raid on a zombie infested apartment building. Together they make their way to a suburban mall where they hope to barricade themselves in and whether the Zombie apocalypse, all the while trying to keep away from the zombies already wandering the inside of the building. But this are not smooth sailing for the quartet as the world collapses around them. Slowly, civilization is dying and our four protagonists would soon follow as slowly but surely, the dead move in for the kill.Dawn of the Dead gained much notoriety for its gore and gruesome depictions of decapitations. But compared to other recent gory movies, one gets the impression that authorities back in the 70s may have been over-reacting. The so called ""decapitations"" involve rather fake looking prosthetics and make up. Even The ""gory"" and bloody scenes are given a very cartoonish look thanks to some off colored orange blood that looks more like stale citrus puree than vital fluids.Then there are the zombies which are more silly than scary. Every zombie seems to be just a person covered in gray powder make-up and stiffly shambling around like retards. The main characters easily out run them and are even able to knock them down with a single punch. The zombies only ""catch up"" with the characters thanks to some stupid careless blunder like forgetting which key opens the door.Speaking of characters, all four of the main cast are rather likable despite their strong inclination towards silly and illogical courses of action. Each actor plays their role with such earnestness and believability. There is sufficient development time allocated for each one of them and it is easy to get emotionally involved in this film. Dawn of the Dead is no doubt influential, but in all honesty, its time has come and gone. Some erratic pacing issues make the scenes in-between zombie encounters downright boring. At most, Dawn of the Dead 1978 succeeds as a social satire and believable character centered classic. Beyond that, it fails to live up to its hype and comes across no more than a quaint relic of the late 70s.",Dawn of the Dead

124,jayjaycee,Let's go to the mall ... Undead,7,19 October 2019,"""Dawn Of The Dead"" is a 1978 horror film directed by George A. Romero starring David Emge and Ken Foree. The second installment of the ""Living Dead"" trilogy is said to be the most influential and (at times) even best out of the three. As someone who absolutely loved the first movie from 1968 my expectations towards the successor were high. As I watched it yesterday, I had mixed feelings about it, to be honest. The biggest flaw that showed itself throughout the entire run time is the fact that the screenplay did nothing for the sympathy towards the four protagonists. I literally didn't care about any of them and wasn't even afraid about their lives - so much that I even forgot their names at important scenes. Additionally, the way this film captures the situation is simply bland and unrealistic. Every character acted apparently bored by the danger, by the massive threat that might kill them. Although a few of them are trained policemen it's extremely unconvincing that their genuine reaction towards flesh eating zombies (!) shows neither shock or dread. They acted with such apathy that there was no packing atmosphere at all. I deeply regretted what I decided on watching - till the second act. This the part where Romero shows what he's capable of doing. The Zombies are the minor threat and only play a passive role in the whole image. The film doesn't want to scare you by the undead - it's the complete opposite - it wants to scare you by the behaviour of the living. Just as ""TWD"" today, it heavily criticizes the people's consume and the capitalism of the modern society. Behind all the blood and rotten flesh it's social commentary at its best. When the protagonists raid the mall they're happy in the beginning, but deeply saddened in the end. That's the point they realize their beloved society slowly declines. It actually conveys a highly important message, sometimes directly in the face of the viewer. Several (at times even comedic) parts seem so macabre to us that it makes us feel unsettled - because it shows us the way we would behave ourselves. At times though, this brilliance is destroyed by subtle racism and sexism that was not necessary at all. All in all, this horror drama is a both exciting and sometimes extremely boring experience, that despite its many flaws manages to at least entertain a little. It lacks an packing atmosphere and relies more on the decent premise than the execution. I'm slightly disappointed, but it's still no disaster. It's just not as magnificent as it's said to be.",Dawn of the Dead
125,deanofrpps,Shop Until They Drop (or Droop),6,22 June 2007,"On a superficial level Dawn of the Dead may be the goriest horror film ever made. It is chock full of splattered blood and brains--- all in living color.The premise of the story is hardly original or brilliant. The dead have come back to life to eat the living. Four people escape from the collapse of civilization into the security of a bank in a shopping mall as armies of the dead batter the sanctuary in search of blood. Can the brave few hold out, against the growing moans of the massed hungry undead pounding at the gates? The degree of graphic violence, human evisceration, exploding heads, and gruesome flesh eating, as horror for its own sake, would ordinarily leave it beyond consideration of mainstream audiences. However the flight of the few brave survivors, two soldiers, a helicopter pilot, and a reporter into a suburban shopping mall gave the film an unexpected dimension in the closeness of the isolation of four people setting up a quasi home in a shopping mall under zombie siege. Though graphic and gory, perhaps the most blood stained American film of all time, the film rendered a sharp social criticism of consumer culture.Beyond the blood and feast of Splattering violence, dark humor reigns. Ensconced in the mall the heroic survivors have secured the mall against the zombies, the heroes perambulate about through the stores. Although civilization itself has collapsed, Stephen shows disgust at the expense of a new coat as he examines the price tag of a coat. Yet on the whole the acting is wooden and the lines goofy.In the midst of poor delivery of a bad script, Dawn of the Dead renders a socially relevant rebuke to the mindless excesses of our Society gone mad in the banality of blatant materialism and acquisitiveness. In the moral vacuum of a culture of consumerism, Zombies drawn to the mall do not knowing why. Yet the PA system makes pointless announcements to the nearly departed shoppers.The film's satire of consumerism and greed is unparalleled.Outside of the unintended allegory the film is simply awful. Special effects were hardly terrific. Most of the budget must have been spent on renting out the mall, leaving little for makeup. The make-up must have been leftover from a clown's birthday party. The camera focuses on extras fashioned as Blue-faced zombies, with inadequate makeup, claw at the doors of the mall. They don't look nearly as dead as typical shoppers on the day after Thanksgiving.In spite of the Zombie's orgy of ripping female victim's blouses off, unnecessary to the plot of blood and gore, the film creeps at an excruciatingly slow pace at times. The scripting could have crafted more sympathetic characters than the annoying Steven or the irritating Roger or the brooding Peter. One might like to feed the entire cast to the zombies if not for the sensitive and sensible Fran, whose her character is inadequately developed throughout most of the film.Yet it's always the darkest before the Dawn. Will the moral ambiguity of a culture of consumerism survive?.Dawn of the Dead was filmed on location at Monroeville, Pennsylvania mall.",Dawn of the Dead
126,jcbutthead86,One of the Greatest Horror films and Sequels of all time. A Brilliant Classic.,10,8 September 2012,"George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is not only one of the greatest horror films of all time but one of the greatest sequels of all time the brilliantly combines Horror,Action,Gore and Satire. All of these elements combined make Dawn of the Dead one of the all time great Horror classics. It's one of my favorite Horror films and one of my favorite films in general.Set years later after the events in Night of the Living Dead,Dawn of the Dead depicts the city of Pittsburgh and the rest of the United States being overrun with zombies. Trying to escape the madness,two swat team members Peter(Ken Foree)and Roger(Scott H. Reiniger)traffic reporter Stephen(David Emge)and his television staff girlfriend Francine(Gaylen Ross)set down on shopping mall for safety. While at the mall,the four survivors find out that the mall is swarming with zombies and find out that when there's no more room in hell the dead will walk the earth.Dawn Of The Dead is easily one of the greatest Horror film of all time and also one of the greatest sequels ever made that is an amazing follow-up to George A. Romero's landmark Horror classic Night Of The Living Dead. Dawn of the Dead is a brilliant film that works as a horror film and social commentary satire. DOTD is great because of the horror and suspense of the film and the fact that it combines two great genres of Horror and Action. The Horror come greatly in the gore and suspense of the situations and showing human beings and society falling apart whether it is not working together,excepting that the zombies have taken over the world and despite having guns and weapons more people will become zombies. The Action in the film is intense,fast and very violent and gory and you feel that danger and violence can come at anytime because with every Action scene is done with suspense,dread and a harsh brutality that will shock and disturb viewers. The gore in the film is bloody,insane and unexpected and is not for people with weak stomachs or weak hearts. I don't know if George Romero was trying to top each zombie film with the gore but the three dead film. seem to get more bloody and violent with each movie. DOTD was the first film in my mind to combine Horror and Action and both of these great genres which I love work well together and are similar because both Horror and Action are about getting people to react with blood and gore(Horror)or shootouts and explosions(Action). Horror and Action mix well together and I believe without DOTD there wouldn't be James Cameron's Aliens or the Resident Evil films. The four main characters in the film are likable and you identify with them because you can feel what they're whether it is terror,fun or fear and trying to figure out how to survive the zombie apocalypse and trying to figure out why this is happening. I love that Romero uses this film to make fun of mall culture having the zombies roam the mall walking slowly and in a blank face. Maybe Romero was saying(with zombies)that humans had become addicted to the mall and consumer culture that humans had become emotionless and feeling dead. This is a timeless statement about our society about the humans in this film and Romero's other zombie films is that the humans are becoming zombies and the zombies are more human and much more alive than their human counterparts and Romero puts this in our face. The main characters in the film start to become emotionless too proving that while the mall is fun and has clothes,food,water and shelter it can grow dull and won't be around forever and someone else can come and takeover the mall. DOTD is the first film in my opinion to use a mall as a central part of film and Romero does it brilliantly. Dawn maybe the lightest film in Romero's dead trilogy because of the humor and satire and color of the zombies(blue and gray) and because this film is not as bleak or as hopeless as NOTLD was,but the film still has a dark edge and message that the two other dead film had. The ending of the film(the last 20-25 minutes) is great because it mixes zombies, gore,blood,Action and Humor and vicious violence all at the same time. A great ending.The actors do a great job. David Emge is wonderful as Stephen,the helicopter pilot bringing sadness,sympathy and depth. Ken Foree is excellent as Peter and brings intensity and coolness to the performance. Scott H. Reiniger is amazing in the role as Roger bringing most of the films humor. Gaylen Ross fantastic as Francine,Stephen's girlfriend and brings depth and dignity to the role. Tom Savini has a small,but amusing role as a biker with a great use of the machete.The direction by George A. Romero is excellent bringing great camera angles and moving the camera at a fast pace. The Horror and Action scenes are well done by Romero and are brutal and intense from start to finish. Great direction,Romero. The special effects by Tom Savini are excellent,bloody and well done and some of the best special effects in a Horror film. Amazing effects,SaviniThe score by Dario Argento and the goblins the great,intense and iconic and matches the films tone perfectly. One of the best scores in horror film history.In final word,if you love horror films and zombie films Dawn of the Dead is a film that should be in your collection and is a horror classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10",Dawn of the Dead
127,GeorgeRoots,Let Them Eat Flesh.,10,7 December 2013,"The movie with some of the greatest use of fake blood ever, what can be said that hasn't already been said about ""Dawn of the Dead""? Possibly the most blatant satire movie of all time, yet so subtle, ingenious and beloved in its execution. George A. Romero has created the ultimate zombie story for decades to come. Words fail to describe my love of this movie, not for the fact it was possibly the goriest movie of its time, but for the fact I just seem to find a new appreciation for it with every viewing. Its legacy ended up inspiring countless unofficial spin-offs in various countries (Some of which are actually very good), and heavily influenced countless film-makers and musicians to date.With its opening credits you are literally thrown into middle of the chaos, just as confused as our leading actors. After witnessing both the situation in a city block and the rural areas of America, four survivors of an unknown pandemic of zombies take shelter in a mall. Whilst running into and taking care of the various undead that plague the area, they begin to reinforce and set up home within. Unbeknownst to them that without everyday distraction they begin to unwittingly turn their new home into their prison, attracting all kinds of undesirables that could be considerably worse than the undead.Sure the abundance of Zombie related media nowadays are considered vastly superior to some of the stuff of old, but there are things that make a George A. Romero Zombie film like no other experience. The casting is always fantastic, and this group of four have particularly strong mannerisms that you'll just care for them instantly. It has the feelings of an underground movie, costing less than a million dollars, apparently shot during the closing hours of the mall and all cleaned up for the following day. Add a superb soundtrack by famous Italian prog-rock group ""Goblin"", and the aid of another Italian dynasty who have their names etched in Horror history the Argento brothers (How can you go wrong?). Most DVD releases contain alternate endings and deleted scenes, but more importantly an hour long documentary of the stars (Both humans and zombies) and their dedicated fan base revealing tattoos, artwork's, merchandise etc. The list goes on. Final Verdict: It's really hard to compare this to anything prior or present. George is and always has been in a league of his own, and as Zombies to this day become even more relevant and ridiculously overused, we will always have the one and only original ""Dawn of the Dead"". 10/10. There will never be anything like it again.Sadly I yearn for the day where I'll be able to talk to death about it with a friend, as most of mine seem to dismiss it. However one in particular that wasn't a fan, gave me a series of stills from a private movie collection. I kid you not, I have everyone of them framed.",Dawn of the Dead

They manage to arm themselves they lock down the mall, and destroy the zombies inside so they can live for a while. As the months go on, however tension begin to build that they've fallen prey to the zombies. Soon they have even more problems to worry about, as a large group of bikers discover the mall and invade it, which forces them to fight off both the bandits and flesh-eating zombies.

129,loomis78-815-989034,Epic Zombie film is an all time Classic,10,23 February 2014,"It took George A. Romero ten years to make a sequel to his landmark film ""Night Of The Living Dead"", but it was well worth the wait. Continuing the theme established in the original, the dead have come back to life as zombies and are feeding on the living. This time we follow the adventures of four survivors who are thrust together and escape in a helicopter from a suburban area under siege. Eventually they land on the roof of a large shopping mall. They get in through the roof and catch their breath. Romero has some fun showing the zombies walking the mall aimlessly, simulating all of us who have roamed big malls being brain dead consumers. The group decides the mall has everything they could need. They start a plan to kill the remaining zombies in the mall and block the entrances so no more can get in. During this sealing off of the mall Roger (Reiniger) is bitten and hangs on to life for awhile before turning into a zombie himself. Peter (Foree), the unannounced leader of the group, has to kill his good friend in a shocking sequence. The remaining three live out all their consumer fantasies and surviving almost becomes secondary to them. This is threatened by a gang of thieving bikers who break into the mall and let the zombies back in. The survivors must fight for their lives against the zombies and the bikers. Almost completely different in tone and feel from the original, Dawn of the Dead is an equally groundbreaking horror film. This is a zombie film that is grim, brutal, and graphic and still manages to be fun while it is scary. Up to this point, zombies just hadn't been done like this. The brilliant make up and effects by Tom Savini are mind blowing! Zombies take graphic bites of flesh out of the victims and gore flows. The movie has countless classic moments like when a zombie climbs up on a crate and the helicopter blades slice the top of his head off. Virtually everything in this movie works, starting with a great cast of unknowns. Ken Foree as Peter reminds the audience of Ben from the original. Foree turns in an emotional and believable performance along with Gaylen Ross as the only female in the group. She finds out she is pregnant during the ordeal in the mall and the acting is just great. Romero uses the zombies in different ways. One way is for comic relief like when the bikers are slapping pies in their faces. But at other times they are quite harrowing and terrifying like when Fly boy Stephen (Enge) is trapped in an elevator and the doors open and the zombies rush in, one of the films scariest scenes. The audience can't help putting themselves in the place of the survivors, and they have so many close calls the audience becomes drained. This movie paved the way for many zombie rip off films in the 1980's but none of them captured the thrill ride that is Dawn Of The Dead. Romero's movie of the end of the world, told through the walking dead is a unique vision and a one of a kind zombie film. A must see in every way.",Dawn of the Dead

132,geminiredblue,Terror! In Aisle Five!!!,9,8 June 2011,"Last April, I made a pilgrimage. Never was I more ill-prepared! Here I was in a t-shirt and shorts, with a light jacket just in case. But where I was going, there was rain mixed with snow and the temperature never got above 40. However, it was all worth it as I neared my destination. I was struck with awe, almost heard voices in the background. Upon setting foot inside, I felt the rush of a thousand restless souls, as I heard the distance chime of a great clock. All the while, the mindless masses of men, women and children shuffled past. I just couldn't believe it, I was standing in the mecca for die-hard zombie fans. Yes, I was in Monroeville Mall, site of George Romero's classic DAWN OF THE DEAD! Being a Pennsylvania resident, I've always felt a special affinity to the works of Pittsburgh's horror maestro. Romero redefined the modern horror movie with his 1968 groundbreaking debut NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, still my favorite horror movie of all time! Ten years later, thanks in part to fellow great Dario Argento, dear ole George got a chance to revisit. And talk about a wallop of a sequel! Here's the story: As the zombie plague ravages the country and society breaks down, four survivors decide to take refuge at a gigantic mall. After making numerous mistakes and sacrifices, they have the mall to themselves. As months go on, we get a sense of isolation and really get to feel for the characters. However, they find their safety is short-lived as a renegade biker gang places their sights on the mall as well. Where in NOTLD they could only show a minimum of violence, now (with the help of special FX man Tom Savini) they are able to show the zombies and their victims in more graphic detail. Thankfully, the ultra-violence is limited to a few key scenes, but that makes those scenes more effective. The real terror, as in all of Romero's movies, comes from man's inhumanity to man. Plus, it's also eerie to see how quickly everything falls apart in a time of crisis. Once again, Romero struck gold!",Dawn of the Dead
133,youngcollind,Late to the party,8,4 October 2021,"Admittedly, I have a weird bias, watching this film for the first time in 2021, having spent the majority of my life ingesting so much of the zombie media that it undoubtedly inspired in the 43 years since it's release. It's quite difficult to separate it from more recent interpretations and try to imagine how it must have affected audiences at the time. The most startling contrast is the effects, with the blue face-paint looking downright laughable, but the clear use of actual meat for guts is grosser than any CGI effects. The tone ping pongs from the expected violence to some slow sequences and some funny sequences that would feel out of place in a similar movie today. It admirably contains poignant commentary on consumerism as well as critiques on government crisis mismanagement that is all the more chilling in a post pandemic world. The meat and potatoes though, is of course the zombie attacks, which can be a double edged sword. I do have an appreciation for the level of gratuitous violence the film achieves, which seems excessive even today, so must have been groundbreaking at the time. However, without much of a satirical or dramatic angle attached to the relentless deaths, the incessant action can grow a tad tedious, especially when you've seen this kind of thing done some many times before. Definitely a solid ride though, and I fully respect it's influence, even if I'll never know what it was like to watch this for the first time as a teenager in 1978.",Dawn of the Dead
134,meathookcinema,"Clever, Perceptive and Kick-ass",10,1 November 2018,"The sequel to George A Romero's Night of the Living Dead shows that the zombie epidemic has gotten much worse and society is on it's knees. Two television workers plan to escape with two SWAT team members in the TV station traffic helicopter in search of...whatever they can find that's better than their current situation.There is so much to love about this friggin' film. The tenement opening scene (the shoulder bite was cut by the BBFC as was the exploding head), the way the film suddenly changes course completely as the four fly off in the helicopter, the scene where they land to fill up the copter with fuel (theres the taboo of zombie kids being shot here. Theres also the amazing scene of the zombie having his head decapitated by the helicopter's blades) and then we get to THE SHOPPING MALL!!!The mall is one of the greatest locations ever used in a film. Imagine having this shopping centre at your personal disposal with everything inside being free and your property. I love Romero's social commentary regarding this. The dream of consumerism quickly rings hollow as do the images being conveyed within the advertising produced before the zombie epidemic. Within the extended cut of Dawn (which is just as good, if not better than the original theatrical cut of the movie) the female character Francine is the only person who wants to leave the mall when the topic comes up of whether to move on or not. The men state that they have everything they need here and so should stay but Francine says that the mall is 'a rut. A trap'. Ans she's completely right.The zombies continue to come to the mall (Stephen mentions that 'this was a big part of their lives') which is a brilliantly wry observation by Romero. In this film the living dead have a very aesthetically pleasing blue tinge to their skin. Within the film the blood is redder than red making the film fully realise it's comic-book vision. But it's more than this. The film looks like a series of Pop Art paintings come to life. Andy Warhol had plenty to say about consumerism and mass production (his studio was called 'The Factory'). It's almost like he was art director on this opus.But aside from all of the insights and allegories, this film is just great, great fun! The kills are innovative, disgusting and completely brilliant (Tom Savini returns to make-up and special effects duties and this film is probably the best demonstration of his work). Savini also stars as the members of a biker gang who try to take over the mall and seize it from the main four characters.Wanna see a custard pie fight between bikers and zombies? Wanna see a zombie Hare Krishna, nurse and nun? Wanna see John Amplas (the lead from Romero's earlier 'Martin') as a Pop Art Hispanic dude? It's all in this film- and much much more.I also love the character arc for Francine and the bromance between Peter and Roger.This film has it all. Seriously.",Dawn of the Dead
135,Toronto85,Dawn of the Dead,8,30 May 2012,"Dawn of the Dead is my favourite of the ""dead"" series next to the original Night of the Living Dead. It begins pretty much right after ""Night"" ended. A couple named Francine and Stephen along with Peter and Roger take a helicopter and head out to find some sort of help or a safe place to stay for a while. They end up stopping on the roof of a large shopping mall and decide it's the perfect place to stay. It has all of the necessary resources they'd need including food and ammo. The only obstacles in their way are the hungry zombies and a biker gang hellbent on looting the mall.The main filming location of the shopping centre was a brilliant idea. It's a lot of fun watching the characters roam around the mall picking up whatever they want or need all the while battling zombies who are hungry for human flesh. The gore is at an extreme in 'Dawn' thanks to Tom Savini. We get blood and organs and everything imaginable being eaten, really brutal stuff. The zombie makeup wasn't that good, they looked purple and gray and very ordinary but no big deal. I also really liked the character development in this film. You feel for them and want them to survive the attack.I love this original Dawn of the Dead, it is better than the remake which I've seen. The moments in the shopping mall are classic, and with such a low budget you have to commend Romero and the entire crew for putting together such a masterpiece.8/10",Dawn of the Dead
136,Chaves7777,A review: Dawn of the Dead (1978),10,12 July 2008,"Dawn of the Dead (1978) Directed by George RomeroStarring David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger and Gaylen RossThe sequel to ""Night of the Living Dead"" is an apocalyptic poem and the definitive zombie classic. Here, four people get locked in a shopping mall while a bunch of zombies dominate the world. All the stage production, performances, music (Goblin and Dario Argento) and direction is perfect and makes this one of the best horror movies ever (Atleast the best zombie movie ever). Full of satire, clever and gory. There's available various versions of the film including the original theatrical exhibition (126 minutes), the longest (140 minutes) and the Dario Argento's version runs for almost two hours. Remade in 2004. Followed by Day of the Dead. Watch Lucio Fulci's ""Zombi 2"" for an untented sequel.",Dawn of the Dead
137,Sonatine97,"A competent flick but not better than ""Night""",9,21 July 2000,"I first saw this movie back in 1980 at some fleapit of a cinema along with ""Night"" and a couple of other zombie movies from Italy. It was hard going watching these movies over an 8 hour session but it gave me a chance to compare like-for-like Romero's films against each other.On a technical basis Dawn is streets ahead of Night (and most other zombie films too); for once the action takes places on American terra-firma rather than some tropical island; most of the action occurs in broad daylight so that we can see quite clearly what is going on; the camerawork & musical score by Goblin is also top notch.However, as far as stories, drama & tension goes, Night is much much better. There is a real air of panic & hopelessness in the first film, whereas in Dawn it's all very choreographed and almost played tongue-in-cheek.The underlying sub-plot (ie consummerism gone mad) achieves its goal better than the main plot of surviving/escaping zombie attacks. That, in spite of having a whole shopping mall to own, where money, materialism & avarice, is so readily available, it is the normal social interaction (the humdrum life) that is really missing from their lives.That explains why the gang decide to leave  the mall near the end of the movie: being super-rich is superficial compared to living a relatively normal life, and that's one of the great ironies that Romero throws in our faces.The gore is excessive in places rather than relying on suggestion (do we really have to see every bite to prove a point that a zombie is dangerous?); but Savini does a good job with the make-overs & the sfx.The acting is a little wooden but Ken Foree played a good reliable leader; and Gaylen Ross offered a more human dimension than the three gung-ho males.But for all that the original Night is far far better, regardless of its rather amateurish looks. On a personal level I also felt the second sequel, Day of the Dead was more intellectually superior to Dawn as well.***/*****",Dawn of the Dead
138,Ziya90,Humanism is dead,1,9 December 2009,"I am not against violence in cinema, stylish violence like Kill Bill, realistic violence like Martin Scorsese movies, but this is none of them, this is sick or and sadistic violence. Not just Dawn of the Dead, all such kind of movies including other Romero zombie movies or Hostels etc. Some, especially critics say this violence has a purpose, but I think just the opposite. People are eaten, they are torn to pieces and Romero zooms in which makes it more sick. I don't even mention the quotes of Eli Roth. However, an action movie which they say pointless has a purpose, it is action, so means entertainment. For example Schwarzenegger movies. Some have found hundreds of political and social mentions, satirist material, criticism. I see such interpretations as a kind of brainwashing or manipulation and also very ridiculous. The scene which the Afro American zombie kills the man by using gasoline pump recalls petrol wars. Enough? A critic says that Dawn of the Dead criticizes consumer society. The master! points out pathetic situation of consumer society, capitalism and the system. No, the movie does not say this to me, it says nothing, this is a horror movie, a zombie movie, but this consumer society criticism kills me. All living organisms consume in order to survive, not only human being, also animals and plants. Yes, you know these, but it seems that they don't. Then, what is this consumer society? Fight Club is about consumer society, Romero's zombie movies are about consumer society. I think that this is explained only by saying that they see the movies as they want to see, it is in their minds, not in the movie. I am sure that Romero says a couple of things in the interviews, but it does not change anything. I am not interested in such things and also I am not able to do that and I count myself lucky sometimes. Then am I not conscious or sensitive to politics and society? What they call, conformist? Another odd term, because if you are not against many thing, you become a conformist which means pathetic. Well, I prefer being a conformist rather than supporting this kind of movies. I get bored of some reviews like in Diary of the Dead, this time, the master puts his finger on media, as you know in the previous movie, he pours cold water on army, so... I am not cheered up, am I weird? And consumer society comes, consumer society, consumer society, I hate this as I hate the terms pornographic violence. If a group of half naked men appear and then get hurt or killed, the movie becomes pornographic violence. To me cinema means art, entertainment, in fact everything, but not a political and social message maker machine. Cinema is more than entertainment, but this is different. Day of the Dead? It criticizes military forces! because in the movie zombies eat soldiers rather. Hmm. Still, does not it sound ridiculous? Yes, zombies eat soldiers, but non soldiers either, let's be cheered up, let's be happy, die die die you dickheads, enjoy. I am sure some do while watching. Why should I get pleasure from watching something which a zombie eats a soldier? Why should I get pleasure from a picture which a dead munches a man or woman? Land of the Dead. I should talk about it too. According to some critics, it was the criticism of upper class, rich people and religion. Yes, this might be correct, zombies devour rich people in the movie, but who cares? Rich or poor, military officer or not, capitalist or labor, these people are satisfied with watching the brutal killing of people who they hate. As Romero's direction in Dawn of the Dead is ridiculous in some parts, Land of the Dead is the same. It was too shallow, rich people are safe in a place, they laugh, they don't care about the other poor people outside, they make shopping, they eat, they drink, they lead a life of luxury. An extreme Marxism? In Dawn of the Dead, even if the content is not as shallow as Land of the Dead, it is just a bad zombie movie. However, it has some moments, that's all. The new Dawn of the Dead? Very good. No sick violence, plus action and suspense.",Dawn of the Dead
139,kurciasbezdalas,I can't believe that I waited so long before watching it,10,3 February 2009,"I was afraid that this movie is going to be boring, so I waited quite long before watching it. I really liked George A. Romero's Day of the Dead and every time when I watched other zombie movies, I was expecting them to be as good as Day of the Dead and of course I was disappointed. This is the prequel of Day of the Dead, it's kinda different, but still great. There is always something going on in this film. There is lots of blood, action and even humor. Actually I think it would be kinda exiting to be stuck in a shopping mall with lots of guns and zombies. Sounds fun. This is what this movie about. Of course the characters of this film are a little depressed, but still from time to time we see them having fun in a shopping mall who now belongs to them. More zombie movies should be like this.",Dawn of the Dead
140,Atavisten,Brilliant sequel with social commentary aplenty,7,26 April 2005,"This takes up the social commentary from the first installment and expands it to include consumerism as well (zombies in a supermarket, anyone?). In fact the whole movie, as it don't take itself seriously at all, IS social commentary. The horror of the first is very much replaced with comedy in this one though, and successfully so. I feared that with Tom Savini and Dario Argento on board this would turn into a nasty gore-fest, but I am happy to report only one repulsive scene. Maybe it was a cut version? Some of the trigger happy gun-crazy racist bunch of redneck breed made me think of the 'National Rifle Association' bunch, I don't know if this was deliberate or not, but I'd like to think so.There is even good suspense when they run from the zombies, but not as potent as in 'Night of the Living Dead'.

142,kingofdanerds,Too silly for my taste but still entertaining enough,7,5 July 2021,"George A. Romero's 1968 film, Night of the Living Dead, changed the horror genre. So, naturally, there had to be a sort of follow up. In 1978, the world saw Dawn of the Dead. Romero got the idea for the film after visiting a shopping mall and decided to make the film take place in one and to have a whole commentary about it. The film's history cannot fully be summed up in this amateur review, but do seek out some documentaries if you want. The film stars David Emge, Ken Foree, and Scott H. Reiniger. The film was a modest hit financially due to it's low budget but due to it's violence (perhaps the most violent film of it's time), was not as well recieved. But, the film in the later years would be considered one of the best zombie films ever made.Four survivors of the ongoing zombie outbreak get into a helicopter and fly to a shopping mall where they must hole up and wait it all out.Dawn of the Dead, for one, is a very hard film to find a hard copy of due to the film being out of print. Second, the film is not on any major streaming service either. But luckily, as of the time of this review, you can find all three versions of this film posted on Youtube by some rather generous Youtubers. With that out of the way, Dawn of the Dead has been a film I have been wanting to watch for some time and by the time I actually watched it, I was some what let down. Do not get me wrong, I still like the film, but I do prefer Night of the Living Dead more than this film. This film is just as important to horror as Night of the Living Dead. This film is the modern setup of a modern zombie film. Right from the beginning the film shows the chaos and how severe the whole zombie outbreak is and the film depicts it fairly well. We are introduced to our four main characters who, while not really developed, are likeable. Much like in the way that Red Dawn has it's characters. The characters here are in a position that they have to work together and when all their strategizing works out, when they celebrate, we celebrate. The acting is heavily improved here when compared with the previous film. This film does clever commentary on shopping malls and consumerism and how it makes us all zombies. Plus, the shopping mall is a pretty clever location practically and thematically too and the film handles it fairly well. One thing that I cannot praise this film for is it being scary. Dawn of the Dead is nowhere near being scary. Sure, the film has it's tense moments but I find Night of the Living Dead to be far more effective. What Dawn of the Dead does is to be satirical and comedic. I am fine with a zombie film being comedic and even satirical, but add some scares. The European cut (of which I have not seen yet) gets rid of the comedic bits entirely. I suppose the overall looming scare is the growth of the outbreak but, here is what the film does with that. Basically, we have a lot of zombies. So, basically dispatch of them by having prolonged scenes of our characters shooting them in the head. Now, I know this film is a bit unconventional in storytelling. This film does not follow the plot pyramid of having your climax and rising and falling action. This film does that whole ""we are holed up in this mall, here is what needs to be done, so let's get things done"". It should be noted that Tom Savini does the special effects in this film and the gore effects are pretty good. I should note that most of the gore effects are headshots but we do get some variety here and there. The zombies don't look that great as they look blue and grey and even Tom Savini has expressed some regret. I should also mention the film's musical score which I always found rather weird. It just does not fit in a zombie movie. Then again, this is a pretty unconventional zombie film that is just outright comedic.Dawn of the Dead is a good film and at times fun. But really weighs this all down is the comedic nature of this film. I like silly, but this is way too silly. But, this film is worth a watch nonetheless.",Dawn of the Dead
143,jcholguin,A worthy sequel,10,23 July 2001,"When the movie first began in the drive-in I expected more of ""Night of the Living Dead"" but I was wrong.  This film actually does a wonderful job of introducing and developing characters.  The idea of surviving in a mall was just great.  It made me wonder what I could do living in a mall and all the fun that I could have.  The scenes of a dying Roger telling his friend Peter that ""I will do everything I can to make sure that I don't come back but if I fail then end it for me"" was so touching.  You actually were hoping that Roger would not come back but we all knew that he would.  A classic to watch.",Dawn of the Dead

While the zombie makeup is not the best (see Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" for REAL zombie makeup), the film itself is a great treat for horror fans.The acting by the unknown actors is superb (I especially liked Gaylen Ross and Ken Foree), the cinematography is top-notch, the Goblin music is one of their top 5 best scores, the gore effects by Tom Savini are surprising and good, and the setting of a shopping mall is a mix of a paradise and a prison! What more can I say? The other reviews here give a better idea of the meaning of the movie (a social battle between the lower class and the middle class), so I won't try to top them. But I will say that this movie is what made zombie movies what they are, the movie that produced countless imitations. Not ""Night of the Living Dead"", that's the unheralded classic. This is the modern classic that spawned zombie films the way they are seen today! Both versions from Anchor Bay (a Director's Cut or a Theatrical Cut) are worth having, the two are very different.

146,Afracious,A superlative cult horror film with a humorous zest,10,29 September 1999,"The sequel to Night of the Living Dead is not as scary but is a lot of fun to watch. I first watched this film in 1979 on VHS video via a top-loading Ferguson Videostar VCR (what an era that was). The zombies are still everywhere and a group of two TV production workers and two SWAT soldiers escape in a helicopter to a giant shopping mall and reside there for a while blocking themselves in from the hordes of zombies, and indulging themselves with its contents, until they are disturbed by an army of destructive bikers, which includes Tom Savini. The ghouls are diverse and the gore is lucid and garish. The film has a real humorous zest to it. The setting of the shopping mall is appropriate. Walking around a large shopping complex nowadays you will find that the people are not dissimilar to the zombies in this film - they wander around in a trance like them. The music is also good and adds to the film's low budget appeal and feel. A brilliant film, that is deeply entertaining and infinitely watchable.",Dawn of the Dead

I enjoyed that but it was more a relaxing experience than a frightening one.For me there wasn't enough gore. More blood, more flesh eating, and more corpses wouldn't have gone amiss. The film was of too high a quality to have been tainted by more violence.The music is memorable and effective but more action than horror.I would go so far as to say that ""DAWN OF THE DEAD"" is not a horror film. It simply isn't horrific. The zombies are mocked too much throughout the film for them to be scary. ""NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD"" (1968, Romero) is a chilling film. It is supposed to be scary and everything about it works towards being scary as its goal. ""DAWN OF THE DEAD"" is essentially too overproduced, too neat, to be scary.It is engaging and gripping and at times very exciting but ultimately it feels like game of make believe, dreamt up by a little group of children in an adventure park.",Dawn of the Dead

As smart as the humans are they aren't smart enough to get rid of the problem facing them. And they run lower and lower on options while in the shopping mall.

I kept hearing people say that this was a great film but they must be zombies themselves or had been watching another movie and mistook it for DOTD. First off this is a Grade B if not C film, not a Hollywood level movie by any means. It's full of some of the worst acting of all time and a director who I guess liked everything he saw on the first take. Any type of suspense has been thrown out the window and I have never seen people with such slow reaction times who create their own problems by being just plain stupid.

Despite this, he had a number of cult successes in the seventies. None of them performed on the level of ""Night"" though. Despite urgings from backers, George never had much interest in producing a sequel to his zombie trend-setter. However, after a trip to a mall, inspiration hit. Released in 1978, ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a hit too, especially in Europe, and changed the rules of the zombie genre again.Picking up some point after ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Dawn"" shows society on the brink of total collapse. Newscasters argue while bogus emergency listings send people to empty help centers. Police wage war against families holing up in ghetto apartments with their undead relatives. News editor Francine and her pilot boyfriend Stephen flee the chaotic news station. Soon, they pick up SWAT officers Roger and Peter. While flying over a world collapsing into undead disorder, the quartet come upon a shopping, empty save for the zombies inside. They shack up there, thinking their problems are over. They aren't.Many zombie movies came in the wake of ""Dawn."" Many of them were simple splatter flicks. In the modern age, zombie movies have become stupid revenge fantasies for survivalists. Romero's movies were always more than that. Each film comments on something in the culture. ""Dawn of the Dead"" is outright satirical at times. It continues ""Night's"" thesis to a degree. People still can't communicate or cooperate, even with the world falling apart. ""Dawn"" sets its sights on something more specific: 1970s consumer culture. From the moment the four enter the mall, they start to covet the objects around them. Peter shouts ""We're going shopping!"" while clearing the place of zombies. They fill a wheel barrel full of stuff before returning to their hiding place. After making the mall their own, the group collects money, eat at a fancy restaurant, and play dress-up. They continue, aware inside that these possessions are meaningless in this new world. The motorcycle gangs at the end are the ultimate expression of this theme. They attack the mall and steal even if there's no reason too. Humans are obsessed with hoarding stuff. The shambling zombies represent brain-dead shoppers, milling about the mall doing nothing. There are deeper layers to ""Dawn"" too. One fantastic moment has a tennis ball dropping down into a horde of zombies. The unwashed masses trying to enter the ivory tower of privileged society. The movie's deep, is my point.Aware of how downbeat his message is, Romero made the conscious decision to make ""Dawn"" as fun as possible. This is his comic book zombie epic. Humor abounds. Characters slide down an escalator banister. Peter and Roger hoot while driving around the parking lot, flattening zombies in their ways. One fantastic sequence has the gang piling in a car, blasting zombies as they drive. Pies are thrown in the faces of the undead. The climatic entrance of the motorcycle gang is, without doubt, the most comic-book-y element. Zombies descend on a biker as he decides to try out a blood pressure machine. The best joke comes when, after infiltrating the mall, the humans decide to switch on the music. There's something blackly comedic about zombies lurching around while up-beat muzak plays in the background. ""Dawn of the Dead"" never forgets its central message but it's also massively entertaining.As an action film and dark comedy, ""Dawn of the Dead"" is hugely successful. Let's not forget that this is a horror movie too. There are some scares: Zombie arms reaching through a boarded-up wall, a zombie-posing-as-a-mannequin. ""Dawn"" is mostly focused on shocks. The level of gore was unprecedented in 1978. A man's head is blown apart with a shotgun. A zombified guy takes a bite out of his former lover's arm. A ghoul has the top of his head cleaved off by a helicopter. Zombie kids are blasted. A screwdriver is stabbed into an ear. Heads and faces are splattered and swiss-cheesed. Most graphically, in the last act, zombies tear apart the bikers like fried chicken, dismembering and disemboweling them. ""Dawn of the Dead"" preceded multiple zombie gorefests but few reached its level. The make-up, with its blue skin, is simplistic but effective. Romero gifts his undead hordes with a surprisingly amount of personality. There's a nurse, a Hare-Krisna, a fat guy in swim trunks, zombies in plaid and zombies in polyester.A strong central cast that takes the material seriously helps the film a lot. Ken Foree and Scott H. Reiniger have great chemistry together as zombie-killin' BFFs Roger and Peter. Roger's tortured last days alive, and Peter's reaction to it, are genuinely heart-breaking. David Emge and Gaylen Ross give great performances as complex, flawed characters. It's a good thing the cast is so strong especially since we spend most of the movie with them. Romero's direction has improved considerably since ""Night of the Living Dead."" He employs POV shots, upward facing angles, atmospheric shadows, and other inventive styles of shooting. The score contrasts Goblin's unnerving prog-rock and driving disco-synth with sometimes eerie, sometimes corny stock music. For all its strength, the movie's a bit long at over two hours. The film drags slightly at the end of the second act, when the characters are living with their ennui but before the bikers show up.George originally had a much bleaker ending in mind where everyone died, some from zombie bites and some from suicide. Realizing audiences would grow attached to the heroes of ""Dawn,"" he spared two. Peter and Francine head towards an uncertain dawn, their helicopter low and fuel. However, there's a glimmer of hope. As messed up as things are, at least companionship holds out. ""Dawn of the Dead"" is probably the most intimidated zombie movie in existence. None of the pretenders to the throne have topped the master though.",Dawn of the Dead

155,Jakealope,Greatest Movie Ever Made,10,22 November 2001,"Dawn of the Dead is my favorite movie. I'll spare the readers the erudition. It had a good, simple plot, halfway decent characters, and enough action and gore to make it amusing and tense. My chief complaint is the usual horror movie stupidity where the characters wander around aimlessly in hostile territory, risking themselves for no reason at all. One would think that reasonably scared people would stay together, and the savvy cops might help amateurs learn how to handle guns and group together for mutual defense. Even Pete was lame: at the truck yard he should have been covering Roger's back, instead he looked like he wanted to go off and take a nap. Another complaint is the way Romero promoted integration by making all the lead heroes black in his 3 zombie movies, then claimed that was all unintentional and he wasn't trying to make a statement. Aside from these small points, Romero proved that a horror movie can actually have a real, semi-believable plot and characters and have some gore and violence without making it central. Compare this to all the mindless slasher and horror flicks where there is no consistency and things just happen without any explanation in order to inject more gore and special effects. In other words, monsters and assailants have enormous power in one scene and in the next they seem helpless and ineffective when confronting the hero. Or the heroes succeed in stopping the assailant, but never finish him off, and even throw their weapons away so the assailant can recover to yet pursue and attack them again.",Dawn of the Dead
156,jay4stein79-1,The Greatest,10,29 December 2005,"George Romero came to everyone's attention with his first zombie film, the low-fidelity but nevertheless frightening (and intelligent) Night of the Living Dead. This was his first film and it was an important film--one of the first horror films produced that had consumed the terrors of Vietnam and regurgitated them for us on screen. Romero claims there's not social commentary at work in any of his Dead films; I say he's fibbing. Compare this film, or Night or Day of the Dead, to Zombi 2 and tell me there's not something more going on in these films than grotesque quasi-cannibalism. There is something and it's what allows Romero's zombie films to transcend genre. They have something to say. Granted, the ideas are not always original, but they package ideology in a way that will attract people who might never give these concepts much thought (I'd hazard a guess that the people drawn to the gore-fest of Dawn are not the type to sit around and think about how rampant consumerism is destroying America). Moreover, Romero is as much of an auteur as Altman or Ford or Scorsese. He has a distinct visual style that adds a further layer to this film. The framing, the angles, the cinematography, and the colors are all typical of Romero. You would never confuse his zombie movies with those of other horror directors. Can everyone look past the gore and see the intelligent, thoughtful, and idealistic movie beneath? I doubt it. When Goblin's ominous soundtrack announces doom and gloom at the beginning of the film and we see Francine's head against the blood red wall, will everyone see the painterly touch and the beauty or will they be thinking of the disemboweling to come? What about the one-legged priest coming in through the smoky door in the tenement basement--isn't that a sublime image? Don't you find the image of zombies wandering aimlessly in a mall as brilliantly funny as I do? Possibly not--this isn't a movie that will appeal to everyone. But I urge everyone to do one thing: don't write it off as horror spectacle. It's so much more than that.",Dawn of the Dead
157,Torgo_Approves,Absolutely amazing!,2,1 March 2007,"That's how I'd describe this movie's rabid fan-base and the ridiculous, outrageous claims they make to defend this steaming pile of reeking excrement. How in the world can something like this be called great satire? Dr. Strangelove is great satire. American Psycho is great satire. Borat is great satire. Dawn of the Dead is not. Dawn of the Dead is an endless amount of toxic waste washing over your TV screen for two excruciating hours. It's a complete insult to anyone with even the slightest bit of intelligence. Ooooh, the zombies are returning to the mall because that's where they spent most of their life! THAT IS SO DEEP! Someone hand George A. Romero a Most Brilliant Man Ever Honorary Award already! How in the world can this be considered great horror? The Shining is great horror. The Omen is great horror (the original, not that comatose slap in the face of a remake that came out last year). Audition is great horror. Casper the Friendly Ghost is great horror compared to this... this... thing! I'd rate DOTD among such classics as Saw III and Freddy's Dead. Let's look at the facts: The acting is awful. It's not ""realistic"" or ""natural"", it's awful. There's a reason most of the cast members never had much of a career after DOTD - they're completely, indescribably, hopelessly pathetic. But hey, I can't blame them since they don't have much to work with... did this movie even have a script? I could actually *feel* my brain dying as the inept cast read their mind-numbing lines and got into life-threatening situations over and over again for no reason except to kill time and because of their own pitiable stupidity.About the zombies themselves... well, imagine the scariest movie you've ever seen, multiply it by a billion, and you're still not even close to how frightening the zombies would have been if they weren't so laughably shitty. Blue makeup sloppily applied to random patches of drunk extras' faces does not equal horror. Period. When I see a horror movie I don't want to watch retards get chased around a mall by giant Smurfs moving at a snail's pace for two full hours.This is amateur hour with pink gore. It's not scary or atmospheric, not intelligent and most certainly not entertaining. It's a classic - I'll give it that. But it's a classic that I wouldn't recommend to any fan of film, ever, and I'd rather pluck out my fingernails one by one with a wrench than watch this wretched atrocity of cinema again.Oh, I'm just kidding you guys! I actually love this movie and was just pulling your leg! I mean, how could anyone look at the pie-throwing scene or at Peter jumping around screaming ""yeeeee-haaaaw"" repeatedly for half a minute and NOT exclaim: ""this is the epitome of cinematic perfection!"" See what I mean? This is pure genius, I tell you, pure genius!! See the 2004 version instead.

There's a lot more to this film than blood and gore (although the film offers plenty of that). There's Romero's comments on commercialism and consumerism, for one thing. There's also the how the film shows how quickly society can crumble in the face of a crisis and suggests that the real thing causing the chaos and standing in the way of survival is not the zombies, but the humans.

There is even Muzak-music in the background! You see what can happen when all order is aborted, then the real living humans demonstrate that they are more frightening then the living ghosts.

163,shaun98,Best zombie movie known to man!,8,23 April 2002,"[possible spoiler]
George Romero deserves credit for his refusal to pander to the Hollywood machine, although it cost him mainstream success. But thus is the price of being an independent filmmaker. Case in point: ""Dawn of the Dead"" could never have been financed by a major studio; they would all have shied away from the extreme violence and grim situation. I doubt that a global invasion of zombies would have been very appealing to a reactionary studio exec.
That's a shame, because the film proudly displays Romero at the peak of his creative powers. He boldly shuns all mortal standards of good taste, as humans and zombies are shot, disemboweled, and otherwise dealt grievous harm. No restraint is exercised if it can be helped. The film is gloriously, delightfully excessive. Picture Romero as a devious child, enjoying his playchest of cinematic goodies, and you will have some idea of the spirit that drove the production. It's more than ""just a horror movie."" You actually care for the characters. Unlike many generic slashers, all the principals are sympathetic, and we wholeheartedly wish for their safety. This fact dawns on us, in an absolutely gripping scene (which I wouldn't dream of revealing) at the very end of the film. I also appreciate the social satire, which demonstrates that a horror film can possess at least some degree of social relevance. Kudos, also, to Tom Savini's memorably gory makeup effects, and to Ken Foree's solid performance as the SWAT team leader; he reminds me of Laurence Fishburne. The rest of the cast perform adequately.I need not remind you that this is an intense, edgy movie that could never secure financing in today's conservative climate. It was never submitted to the MPAA, which would have been a waste of time and effort, as it would have been slapped with an X rating before the first reel was half over. However, it's a treat for the adventurous filmgoer. Just make sure to treat it as if it was already rated NC-17.

164,Thorsten-Krings,Missed opportunity,4,8 May 2007,Is it just me? I thought this film was awful. I have to say though that I watched the video release which is labelled directors cut but is not the version Argento and Romero released for the cinema but a much longer version. The screenplay lacks focus completely: the timing of the scenes and the film is way off. I found the film plainly boring with the occasional gore fest to wake you up. The idea of zombies in a shopping centre is great and hilarious but Romero doesn't really make anything of it. For me the whole film is a bunch of missed opportunities and more the work of a gifted amateur than of a professional film maker.,Dawn of the Dead

Sure, maybe today you would laugh at the special effects, but still it was scary and eerie as you may think it is. The zombies were slow unlike the 2004 one, but they were still very creepy and scary, that's all that mattered. It also had what everyone has been saying about this, it has a social satire, which is the anti-consumerism one, a group of people, news reporters and SWAT team members plan to escape the undead filled city for a safer place, but end up in a mall where they discover a lot of goods, and they decide to stay because it has become a paradise for them, because they didn't have to pay for them now that it's deserted, but eventually they realize they are trapped. A great movie indeed, and the stars Scott Reigner and Ken Foree would appear once more in cameos in the new one, where Ken repeats the same line he did hear, ""when there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth"". The new was scary because the running zombies, even though people argue about them, made it real dangerous, as in this one, what made it scary was the fear shown by many of the people, and the zombies were still scary even though they are slow, and people are still lulled by the fact that they are their people, and made it difficult to exterminate them, and not to mention, the theme, where fear and suspicion get the best out of people and destroys them, like the scene where one of the SWAT team guys goes crazy and shoots everyone, or how the bikers and the survivors fight for the goods, it's like the greed kills them all. Recommended for those fans of Romero, and those who didn't like the new Dawn of the Dead, though I liked it, even though they, the zombies ran. Soon, we'll get to see another ""Dead"" movie, the forth one made by Romero, hope it will be great like this one.",Dawn of the Dead
168,joshi_3592,From killing spree to shopping spree.,8,15 November 2009,"I must admit, my expectations for this movie wasn't big. And many don't see more than the first 20 minutes, and I understand. The first 10 to 20 minutes gives you the impression this is gonna be just another low budget, non stop running away from zombies movie. All wrong. After the characters have been introduced, and the main story starts, that's when it gets interesting.Basically this movie is a protest against the American consumerism, that started in the 70's. And the movie is about four survivors (two soldiers and a couple working for the TV station) who lock themselves into a mall. they get rid of the zombies in the building and makes a home out of it. Now I won't spoil any details about the movie, but much of the film is the four of them going on what I guess you can call a ""shopping spree"". i must say this movie is both scary, thrilling, funny and even charming at some points.OK, now I must admit, this movie has dated a bit. Normally I don't complain about special effects and Tom Savini is just great as both actor and makeup artist in this film. But the blood almost looks pink at some times and when the zombies take a bite of people it's both gross and kinda funny at the same time, as it seem way to easy. Still some effects are great and you must take the time it was made in and the budget in consideration.Now obvious credits must go to the great director George A. Romero, Tom Savini, and some great acting from David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger & Gaylen Ross. Also the ending is great considering how it was originally intended to be.This movie is a true horror and zombie classic. And I recommend it to all horror and George A. Romero fans. But one warning if the idea if a man being eaten alive by a horde of zombies, and no gory details are left out, don't watch it. you may not have the stomach for this film, but then again it's far less nasty than todays movies, so I advice you to give it a chance.

169,Zombified_660,"Satirical, blackly comical action horror thriller. With zombies...don't get many of them.",9,5 July 2005,"It took me absolutely ages to get a half decent copy of this movie to watch. The story is almost as long as that of the movie as I hopped from one fudged TV taping to another. Eventually I scored a DVD copy in a sale, and two days later I can honestly say well-hell fellas, great movie. Admittedly a movie with its flaws, but still great.Dawn of the Dead is firmly smarter than your average bear. Like all the great horror B-Features, Dawn of the Dead gene splices genres and comes out with a sum much greater than it's parts. In contrast to the earlier Night of the Living Dead, which was a downbeat, nightmarish exercise in hypertension and darkness, Dawn of the Dead is a blackly comic action horror, with a wonderful anti-consumer subtext.Over it's admittedly somewhat indulgent two hours and ten minutes, a greatly ironic tale of four people's attempted escape from the zombie horrors wrought by the events of Night of the Living Dead unfolds. Initially stopping off to supply themselves with food and utilities, the group takes up residence in a zombie infested mall, taking mocking pity on the zombies that have come back to haunt the place they spent most of their lives. However, the attraction of the mall proves too much for them and they too find themselves coming under the spell of the demon shopping.It's effectively a study of both human stupidity and stubbornness, and general human greed, using the zombies as an allegory for the slavishness of consumer culture, and showing the downfall that can occur as a result of too much pride and greed. The human survivors could have done much better for themselves had they not stayed in the mall and chanced their arms for human comfort, and their pride at their appropriation of the mall results in them coming off very badly with reduced numbers after looters break in, unwittingly releasing the zombies back into the mall.All this aside, even if you don't care for anti-consumer politics, Dawn of the Dead is a fantastic horror yarn. The sheer scale of the movie is really impressive, and the ensemble cast is excellent, easy to empathise with throughout. The movie is chock full of quality action set pieces and some of the best zombie action committed to film. All even more jaw-dropping when you consider this movie was made for $500,000, which is less than most actors in Hollywood get paid for a days work on much lesser films.However, despite this, Dawn of the Dead has a few small niggling issues. A few of these are to do with the horror aspect. Dawn is much less impactful and terrifying than Night of the Living Dead, due to it's colour film, which has obviously aged much less gracefully than it's black and white counterpart, and partly due to the increased political element. As a result, Dawn of the Dead feels much more like a thriller that just happens to be about zombies than an out and out horror movie. But the result is still horror enough to make it unpalatable for a wider mainstream audience. The lack of impact in the visual style has been compensated for with hardcore violence, and quite frankly much of this violence is horrific in the extreme. Heads are severed, people are disemboweled, and one poor fellow even gets lobotomised by a helicopter blade. Thanks to one Tom Savini, Dawn of the Dead is home to some of the most shocking images film can muster. However, in it's defence, I must say that the violence is far less shocking in context than it sounds on paper and is handled very sensitively. At no point does Dawn revel in violence, it is there for the same reason everything else is in Dawn, to shock you into thinking about the world we inhabit.I'm fine with that, but it stops me from recommending this to a wider audience, which is what I really want to do, but between the visceral gore, long running time and heavy duty political element, I can't help but feel Dawn of the Dead will never get the recognition it deserves from the film community. So I urge you to watch this, to stomach the violence and to attempt to get on board with the politics, because trust me, you need this movie in your life, regardless of your cinematic leanings.

172,DanLives1980,The daddy of all zombie movies!,9,10 September 2011,"In Pittsburgh, a rising tidal wave of the reanimating dead are sending the people into mass hysteria. Rescue stations are overflowing and the authorities have crumbled under the strain. Barely surviving an onslaught against the warring mobs and the growing undead epidemic, two SWAT team members go AWOL, joining up with a couple from the local television station, to escape Pittsburgh and sit out the nightmare somewhere less populated.The further they get, the further they discover just how out of control the situation has become and that there seems no escape from the hordes.So when this band of refugees happens upon a hyper mall on the outskirts of a nearby town, exhausted and running out of food and water, they question what would be their best option in a world where society is breaking down and where money is of no more importance; to risk their lives locking down the futuristic fortress and keeping all they could possibly want for themselves or to move on deeper into the country where most likely certain death awaits?The inevitable choice, with a pregnant woman in their ranks and a helicopter pilot with poor survival skills, is to stay at the mall with all its hypnotising luxuries and riches. Only the pains they will go through to take it all for themselves may in the end render them no different from the mindless walking dead.From beginning to end 'Dawn...' relentlessly comes across as a classic 70's disaster film. The fact that it is a horror film needs no mention. What is never said though is that as a horror film, it successfully applies itself in epic proportions yet still hits home personally. It's a nightmare tale of slow creeping death and a disaster tale of an unstoppable plague. Two things that are guaranteed to give you nightmares when applied to a stylish and emotional drama, although now visually dated. Of course, it's a hell of a lot of fun too.The human drama here is a delight thanks to the charms of key characters throughout the film, even if only in fleeting moments. Peter, played with sombre cool and passive aggression by Ken Foree starts out as quite mysterious yet dangerous, but throughout the film loses his mystique and settles into the reality of a simple man desiring only safety and being faced with a virtual wealth he might never have known otherwise.His friend Roger is his constant polar opposite; always expressing his concerns when Peter remains stoic, attempting sensibility when Peter becomes clouded by anger and becoming a dangerous risk-taker compared to Peter's sensible soldier when the stakes are raised. They play off each other much the same way as your typical action-duo would in a Hollywood film but when the guns are put away, reality succeeds fantasy and the drama exposes a detached brotherly love.The same kind of polar opposite play applies to the characters Stephen and Francine, who are always at odds in one way or another but clearly love each other regardless. What works so well though is the fact that Romero invites you to become irritated by their social habits throughout the film, reminding us that this is not as fantastical as the likes of Hollywood would allow you to believe. Instead of having a promising romance, theirs is fading out as they succumb to their unique case of isolation and a sort of end of the world shellshock.It is perhaps Francine's annoying motherly bickering that is the saving grace before many an action scene, the frightful uncertainty of Stephen's sometimes cowardly heart that leads him to offer her an abortion or Peter's stubborn silences that lead to him becoming an outsider in the smallest bastion of civilisation left on Earth.Much of the film is a tug of war between the grisly and grotesque and an exercise in different forms of humour that is a Romero trademark (tongue in cheek versus tasteless, gallows humour versus harmless family banter) and it is oddly quite brightly lit for a horror film but between his directing qualities and the cinematography so reminiscent of classic Kubrick, this film has so many different qualities that every time I watch it, I'm still picking out hints and clever coincidences every time I see it.If you want to get a vibe for 'Dawn of the Dead' before you watch it, go see Kubrick's 'The Shining,' Cronenberg's 'Rabid,' Romero's 'The Crazies' and none of the perfectly edited ""action-packed and unrelenting"" remakes. Romero did for the horror exploitation genre what Stephen King did for pulp fiction.He gave it a heart and its audience a brain!",Dawn of the Dead
173,HaddonfieldJason,One of the Best Horror Films Ever Made!,10,13 March 2004,"You got to hand it to Romero,he put's the story,and character development before the guts and gore,something slashers all most never do. Not only does he put the story,before the violence,he has a great political satire,yes one with zombies. The film is very scary too. It does a lot,and makes you think. He creates good,and developed characters,who you feel for,not just dumb teens in Springwood,or Camp Crystal Lake. The f/x's are brilliantly done by Tom Savini who gets a role as a biker in the finale. Romero is at the top of his game here. I wish he would have remembered it when he made his later films,and teamed up with Stephen King. This movie is brilliant,and possibly one of the best of the genre.Better than NOTLD,or Day of the Dead,even though both were great films. A triumphant 4/4!",Dawn of the Dead
174,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Thoroughly Entertaining,8,28 August 2013,"Before writing my mini-review for this film I decided to watch this, the original, followed by the 2004 remake.After watching the remake it's a lot easier to write this review and decide on which film I really prefer: the ORIGINAL.The remake is a 'serious' horror-survival film, whereas this is a rip-roaring tongue-in-cheek comedy and, above all, really entertaining. After the first half-hour or so I thought this was going to be a real let down, but little did I know how much I'd be marvelling to myself and chuckling by the time I went to bed with a content smile on my face as though I'd won a free dinner or something. I gained something in life out of watching this film and now feel freer in my positive criticism.Some less-than-serious social questions were asked. What would you do if you found yourself stuck in a securely blocked-off shopping mall with access to everything for absolutely free? Yeah, live it up like kings until you eventually get rescued, or munched. Brilliant.After the completely outlandish nature of the film, the final escape proved to be pretty plausible and full of possibility and hope. Yep, zombies who can't walk upstairs should never be climbing make-shift rope ladders, but hey... we've got this far, let it roll. Normally I would be bothered by plot holes and silly continuity errors such as getting smattered with blood, cutting to the next scene and being clean from head to toe, but that just didn't bother me here because I was so entertained.If you've seen the 2004 remake, you'll be frustrated by the illogical, practically dishonest moral decisions made by the survivors - a film that takes itself too seriously. Here, they're not too worried what anyone thinks, but more interested in their selfish egos and surviving because they're lucky enough to do so.The invasion by the biker gang near the end was a very nice little touch. Yes, not too realistic, especially the daft karate kicks by the gang leader and some unrealistic angles when sniping from the hole in the roof, for example, but it did add a sense of 'oh no' our cosy shopping mall dream is over and now we've got to do something about it.Simply speaking, I was entertained. Maybe not rip-roaringly entertained, but enough to feel that time had been well spent. Actually, I was surprised that the film was any good at ALL.",Dawn of the Dead

Romero's classic,9,9 April 2006,"The second film in Romero's ,so far, 4 great zombie films may be his finest effort.While not as groundbreaking as ""Night of the Living Dead"" this film achieves the all out gore and blood and black comedy in full living color that the first one hinted at.A group of people hole themselves up in a mall and try to survive the marauding hordes of flesh craving walking dead.This film is known for the blood and gore and the reputation isn't for nothing.I first saw this film in 1981 while in college and soon after the film started and we see a head exploded by a gun blast I began to wonder what I was doing there watching this nasty stuff and what kind of madman could make such a movie.I left shaken and vowing never again to go see such a movie again.This movie awakened me to a whole world of horror films that I didn't know existed.It was the first horror movie I'd seen and soon after the shock wore off I was wanting to see another one.And my lifelong obsession with horror began,all thanks to George A.Romero and this classic movie.Of course this movie also has the coolest tag line in movie history-""When there's no more room in hell,the dead shall walk the Earth"".This movie is one of the top five greatest horror movies of all time and if you've never seen it you're in for a big bloody nasty treat.",Dawn of the Dead
176,glenmatisse,Zombie Classic,9,30 October 2020,A handful of survivors camp out at an abandoned shopping mall during a zombie outbreak and realize it might not be as safe as they initially thought.What can be said about Romero's classic zombie film that hasn't already been said. It's inordinately thoughtful for a film of this sort and doesn't skimp on the action and gore either. Tom Savini's gore effects are terrific!,Dawn of the Dead
177,kclipper,One of the original classic zombie films,9,19 July 2014,"This is George A. Romero's sequel to the original 1968 ""Night of The Living Dead"", a completely original concept about corpses resurrecting from the dead (for reasons unexplained) and consuming the flesh of the living. A very low budget, low expectation series of films that eventually developed into an incredible phenomena known as the ""zombie"" genre. Hundreds of films and TV shows have been concocted as a result of this powerful entity about human nature's inability to survive under the circumstances of a catastrophe, and that is clearly Romero's vision.As a long-time devoted horror fan, I am also a Pittsburgh native, and having grown up literally 4 miles away from the location that ""Dawn Of The Dead"" was filmed, one can only imagine the imprint that this movie has made on my psyche. Having attended numerous zombie conventions, the Monroeville Mall Zombiethons, and meeting various actors in the film, I will try my best to give this an unbiased review. Now, this featured the gory make-up FX of Tom Savini before he was a household name and way before computer graphics, so many viewers have mixed opinions on how ""real"" it looks. If you were wondering, it is true that real animal bowels and intestines were used, and gallons of real blood. (something that is just not done anymore). Savini's FX are extraordinary considering the year this was made, the budget, and the improvisations needed to accomplish these scenes. And for the story, well it's very simple. The zombie population has outnumbered the human population at this point causing a decrease in industry, television media and places of rescue and sanctuary. The military is now involved, and soldiers, Ken Foree and David Emge, along with several civilians barricade themselves into a large shopping mall, where survival resources are abundant, but time is not. The zombies begin finding ways in as well as looters and bikers searching for goods. This movie may seem a tad overlong (clocking in a around 130 minutes), and the dialog is thin, but this is one of the first all-out gorefests to ever grace the screen. Romero combines the human element with comic relief giving it a strangely surreal quality. Italian maestro, Dario Argento collaborated on the production, and his European version features music by progressive rock innovators ""The Goblin"" (which some find annoying). Many may not agree that with so many films in this unrelentingly growing genre that this film stands the test of time, but it's place in film history is undeniable, and audiences that appreciate the roots that extend from the more modern exercises in zombie gore should give it a huge thumbs up!",Dawn of the Dead
178,InaneSwine,A compelling political satire,10,23 February 2007,"A group of four people attempt to take refuge in a shopping mall after a worldwide zombie outbreak. Unfortunately, the mall is already home to a large number of the creatures This picture is less of a horror film, as it is billed, than a political satire, symbolising the world's reaction to such an event. Generally, they go to the mall. Some may actually view the film as a comedy  the zombies are indeed blue  with the creatures being destroyed in a very funny, yet brutal fashion. Whether the gore was intentionally comical is unclear.Zombie enthusiast George A. Romero seems to direct the film from the point of view of a child, as the humans and zombies alike run rampant in the deserted mall. However, amidst the action and the comedy, there are some compelling elements of drama.There is enough gore in the film to keep the horror fanatic happy; but fans of satire can still enjoy the film.There have been four or five different cuts of the film. My recommendation is the 139 minute cut.",Dawn of the Dead
179,mungflesh,Good outweighs the bad,7,27 March 2004,"This movie *has* to be seen in the uncut version because without the gore it is a bit lame.Bad points: the music is crap, the acting is budget, the mood is not always one of horror (eg. zombie pie-fight).Good Points:  the gore is unrelenting, even if not always 100% realistic, the plot is believable which is a very very rare commodity nowadays and it had a decent ending. Arguably, this movie re-defined the zombie genre as we know it.I have yet to see the remake and I get the feeling I will find it thrilling but hollow and most certainly not as gory for the time it is released. The '78 version was released in an era when outrageous gore was very fashionable in the movies and this film was definitely up there with the rest. But what put it ahead was that the guts and blood stayed integral to the story.I prefer Day of the Dead as it loses all the above bad points whilst retaining the good but Dawn was there first and is staple viewing for the horror fan.",Dawn of the Dead
180,KHayes666,the film that made zombies scary again,8,3 May 2005,"I loved this movie from start to finish for 3 reasons. The first was because the story was a classic, the dead walk the earth and the living are forced to kill the...already killed I guess. The second reason is because I could see this happening in reality and could relate to the characters. The third was its part of a confusing bet my friends have, in which case we pick characters from the movie to be and whoever is standing at the end gets a cash prize. I didn't make it, in fact I got it worst than anyone as my character was the white cop who slowly died near the end of the movie.Tom Savini is a brilliant make-up specialist and even though he had a better role as Sex Machine in From Dusk Till Dawn, the evil biker he played still made me laugh.From start to finish this movie was scary and with millions of zombies everywhere...if you were in the movie how would you deal with it? 8 out of 10...great flick",Dawn of the Dead
181,kyle_c,**** out of ****,9,13 November 2002,"One of the best horror films ever made, ""Dawn of the Dead"" relies less on frightening the audience than it does on disturbing them.  The film takes the viewer through a plethora of emotions, from a state of terror to exhilaration to humor.  Very well made, with an outstanding score by Goblin, and some excellent effects.  Good performances by the entire cast.  While it's not as terrifying or groundbreaking as ""Night of the Living Dead"", it is better in its own way, bringing lots of new ideas into the genre.

183,pizowell,An epic zombie classic.,10,24 August 2001,"George Romero's Dawn of the Dead is an epic and apocalyptic horror flick that is loaded with social commentary.  Its the tale of a group of people trying to escape from a zombie infested city.  They hold up in a shopping mall and soon make it their home away from zombie hell on Earth.  Well one day this biker gang shows up and turns the place up side down leading to a zombie invasion that leads to an explosion of blood and guts.  Romero's zombie flicks offer us no hope, no salvation for its characters.  They don't know what tomorrow will hold for them and neither does the audience.  We feel hopeless, but at the same time relieved, relieved that we don't have to go through the same ordeals as the characters.  Or do we?  Are we the living dead?  We're alive, but we know we're going to die.  Pardon the pretentiousness.  Dawn of the Dead is a horror classic that is a must for all genre fans.  Check it out!",Dawn of the Dead
184,Mulliga,This is not a Dario Argento movie...,10,25 January 2002,"It makes me cringe to see this movie billed as a ""collaboration between Dario Argento and George Romero."" Let everyone get one thing straight - this is a George Romero movie; he directed it, he wrote most of it, and he directed ""Night of the Living Dead"" as well. Dario Argento helped with the band Goblin and as an uncredited writer, but it is George Romero's surreal, tension-filled direction that makes this film a classic.Whew. Enough about that, on to the review.""Dawn of the Dead"" is the sequel to the classic black-and-white low-budget horror flick, ""Night of the Living Dead."" The dead walk, and with every day civilization decays. A snapshot of the growing commercialism of the late 1970s (as opposed to the 1960s-era turmoil present in the original ""Night""), ""Dawn"" is part action, part horror, and part drama. It has its share of Tom Savini's gruesome effects (that must have been appalling when it was released in 1978), somewhat stale acting, and sometimes goofy lines. But for every awkward moment, the cast turns in two or three classic ones, and for every dumb effect, another, horrifically real one comes to mind. Basically required viewing for any horror fan, zombie fan, or film buff.********SPOILER!***************DO NOT READ!*****My favorite lines:5.

185,Tin Man-5,Best zombie film ever!,10,16 June 1999,"Dawn of the Dead is the sequel to the 1968 classic Night of the Living Dead, and to say the least, it surpasses it! Combining an awesome, self-parodying storyline with extreme gore and an excellent cast, Dawn is undoubtedly the best in Romero's Dead Trilogy, and probably the best zombie film to date.Here's the premise: the zombies have taken over a great portion of the earth. To get away from all the madness, four people-- two military men, a pilot, and a pregnant  woman-- fly off and land in a shopping mall, where zombies are rampant. They spend most of the film here, trying to get the zombies out so they can board up the mall and live there...four people safe in a mall all to themselves.That's the plot, but the film in itself stands as a social comment and a satire on humanity. It is extremely effective as it rises this question: who is worse? The zombies or the humans? As the first film had seven people trapped together realizing that their worst enemies were each other, this film has the four humans working together to try to survive, and the viewer gets the idea that in this world, you're better off as a zombie.The movie also is absolutely terrifying....High on gore, but, unlike most splatter movies, with a strong storyline to back it up. The characters and cast are good, and the direction is well-executed, showing many perspectives and many ideas about the zombies not yet seen. Though the most effective thing about the film is the odd choice for the location: a shopping mall. It seems like a weird choice for a zombie film, but with such a huge facility filled with zombies and four humans who must battle, it comes across as stunningly realistic. Everyone has been to a shopping mall, and therefore, everyone can relate to this film. It was a very smart move for Romero. Without a doubt, this is zombiedom...and therefore, one of horror's....crowning achievements!",Dawn of the Dead
186,MrVibrating,I'll be eaten by zombies...,1,8 February 2005,"...for saying this, but this movie truly isn't good. Not at all. The zombies are un-frightening(what with them having only white makeup to show that they are undead), the concept is rather silly(world being taken over by slow-moving, killable, stupid zombies) and the soundtrack is not related to the events in the movie in any way. The actors tend to do really strange thing, like staring blankly into space when they know they're in a zombie-infected area or leaving the girl unprotected and un-armed. If you like to be scared, don't expect anything from this movie. It doesn't even try. That said, I've better build a hideout from the angry Romero fans.",Dawn of the Dead
187,scott-sw,Romero's masterpiece.,10,24 December 2007,"Dawn of the Dead is truly the masterpiece of Zombie movies, putting George A. Romero at his pinnacle. It follows the same premise of Romero's original work, Night of the Living Dead. The recently dead are coming back to life and feeding off the flesh of the living, turning our familiar world upside-down. Two t.v. reporters and two S.W.A.T. team members go on the run and hold-up in a huge mall. Ironically, the place of dreams becomes their own cell. Trapped in materialism, their sense of survival dulls. Unlike its predecessor, Dawn of the Dead gives us a little more depth, better acting, and a better script. A little camp must remain, along with more humor, such as special effect guru Tom Savini also doing some acting and a stunt. Ultimately, this gives Dawn of the Dead a less cynical ending than Night of the Living Dead. Dawn of the Dead is simply one of the best horror movies ever. It is one of a very few ""thinking"" man's horror film. The zombies, themselves, are caricatures of modern-day America, trapped in consumerism and desire for food.

191,Phantasm01,Great campy 70's zombie fun!,8,9 May 2006,"1978's DAWN OF THE DEAD is the second entry in George Romero's ""DEAD"" trilogy, though it isn't as scary or as groundbreaking as his first, the classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968). Still, for a low-budget sequel, it is an interesting and entertaining film, an unusual mix of action, drama, comedy, and horror that actually functions on two levels: One, it is a stomach-churning study of the depths to which people will sink in order to ensure their survival; and two, it is a dark satire that takes several pokes at Western consumerism.The plot of DAWN OF THE DEAD builds on the premise of its predecessor. The world is now becoming overrun with the flesh-eating zombies, and in the United States, martial law has been declared and all survivors are required to go to state-run ""rescue stations"" for shelter and protection. The manager of a TV station and her helicopter-pilot boyfriend decide to defy authorities and seek out their own save haven, and two police officers--friends of the helicopter pilot--decide to abandon their duties and go along with the couple. The group eventually arrives at an abandoned shopping mall, and when they realize that the stores within contain all they need to survive--food, clothing, and weapons & ammunition--they seal off the building, dispose of most of the zombies inside, and take up residence. But when their claim on the mall and its goods is challenged by a band of motorcycle-riding marauders, the quartet is soon fighting for survival against not only the zombies, but also against their own kind.Although the audience has been made to sympathize with the film's four protagonists, there is no true heroism in this world of Romero's making. Instead, there are only different levels of self-interest and narcissism. After the four move into their new home and start living off the ""fat of the mall,"" they quickly develop a sort of bourgeois attitude towards the comforts they now enjoy. Of course, that is exactly the Western attitude that Romero is ridiculing--that sense of security and satisfaction one feels after amassing material goods. And when the group's right to possession is violently challenged by outsiders, Romero clearly demonstrates just how tenuous a security based on personal possessions really is.Romero is a master storyteller who knows how to manipulate the emotions of his audience. In this film, he creates a relentless sense of unease by juxtaposing the repulsive and grotesque with the lighthearted and humorous. For example, when the quartet of protagonists first occupies the mall, they turn on the mall-wide Muzak system to mask from the zombies the noises they make while looting the stores. So for several scenes there is this macabre contrast between bloody, pasty-faced zombies and syrupy instrumental music. Uncomfortably comical and humorously disturbing.Creepy, bloody (FX by Tom Savini), boisterous, and constantly full of surprises, DAWN OF THE DEAD is easily one of the most entertaining zombie movies ever made. True, it does have an underlying anti-materialism message that is none too subtle, but that doesn't detract in the least from the enjoyment of being playfully spooked and repulsed by all the zombie grotesquerie. All in all, horror fans will have a good time watching this minor Romero masterpiece.",Dawn of the Dead

I am aware that back then it was groundbreaking and gory for the time thanks to its first entry ""Night of the Living Dead"". But for the love of me, I can't see any other reasons aside from its own legacy to receive such an undying praise.I am aware of its social commentary, particularly in this one with themes of consumerism and abortion. I praise and enjoy very much the make-up (although not as much in this movie with its ""blue zombies"") and practical effects most of the time. But between the odd choices of music, the inconsistent scene cuts that don't match up, the awful acting of both characters and zombies (most of them fall before you can hear the shot) and the lingering over actors reactions; I can't help but feel this movie looks like a low-budget film that should have come out even earlier than when it did.I enjoy and love many early 80s and late 70s horror movies like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers(1978)"", ""The Omen(1976)"", ""Alien(1979)"" and ""The Fog(1980)"" to give some that came out around the same time. While these might not feature zombies particularly, they feature an infestation or horde attack of some supernatural nature where ordinary characters have to survive it.I understand it is an independent film without a big budget for the time, but from there to be considered one of the greatest OF ALL TIME. I feel it is a bit overrated for its own good. Perhaps it was trying to pay homage or recapture the same feel or experience of its groundbreaking predecessor, but in a time where horror movies were peaking and were going to peak even more in the 1980s; it felt like a regression to B-Horror formula that clashes in contrast with the new wave of horror of John Carpenter, Sam Raimi and Wes Craven amongst many others.I honestly believe should this movie be edited out some of its scenes and added a better soundtrack, it could end up being a very entertaining short movie. And this taking into account its relevance to the zombie genre, the overall horror movie genre and the independent films out there.IN CONCLUSION, overall it has a good entertainment value and things to say that back then may have been groundbreaking. There are a lot of great sequences and dialogue but they are needles in a haystack of elongated scenes that if shortened would improve its general pacing. I understand how a movie could have been groundbreaking at the time of release considering others that came before it, but I can't help to feel like with the case of George A. Romero's entries, after NOTLD, they don't bring many new additions to the genre. Perhaps it's because his movies have shaped the genre and served as main inspiration for future zombie movies that came after it, but that doesn't exempts them from not having to try harder in all the aspects of a movie.",Dawn of the Dead

198,byrann_gowan,A cult horror film,9,16 December 2011,"I was a little bored of this film, but as it went on, I grew to like and respect it for what it was and when it was made.So, the plot is set up a few months after ""Night."" A group of survivors of this plague that turns the dead into zombies take shelter in a shopping mall. Put two and two together now.First off, I want to say of how smart it is to camp out at a mall if we ever end up in a plague like this (I don't think we will, but who knows). You've got everything in here; clothes, food, accessories. You could basically live inside of a mall, and I guess that is what this film establishes: how we, as a society, love to go to the mall because that's where they have the stuff. I mean, even the zombies here go to the mall because that's where their instinct tells them to go. It's perfect. Bravo, Mr. Romero.My one complaint is just a minor one: I heard about this scene in which a zombie gets his head chopped off by a helicopter. Well, the version that I saw didn't have that, and I was really looking forward to seeing that. When I didn't see it, I was a little disappointed. Maybe I wasn't looking when it happened, but I don't know.Other than that, this is a really good film that has left its mark on horror genre. I truly recommend it if you are a true horror fan. I know that this got the remake treatment, although this time, I heard that people were pleased with the remake. I have nothing against that, but I still believe that people would rather see this film over the remake. A 9/10 for me.",Dawn of the Dead
199,thescholar22,Dawn of the Dead Review (Original),8,9 June 2015,"I never really saw the original Dawn of the Dead until now. Saw the remake but the original is better than that remake of Dawn of the Dead. It starts off at a TV station showing how the zombies are slowly attacking. Also The Goblins, the band used for the Dawn of the Dead, I first heard they're music from Hell of the Living Dead when the Cinema Snob reviewed it. Dawn of the Dead also looks good in color especially in High Definition. Then at the TV studio a girl and a guy try to leave the studio while some SWAT guys do a raid on some building. When the shootout happens it's kind of terrible seeing the living kill the living in these movies. Zombies are also at the building where the SWAT team is and they try and kill them. The makeup I think is okay for the movie and in color, so was the Walking Dead too. A black guy and a white guy from the SWAT team try to talk, bond, and escape the SWAT team. The guy and girl meet the SWAT guys at a police station where they take a helicopter. When going around in the helicopter they see the activity on the ground of the living trying to kill the zombies. They go to refuel and when the guy gets in trouble the girl doesn't seem to help. There's also a scene where a zombie gets his part of head cut off from one of the helicopter blades too. Also black guy kills some zombie kids as well. They then discover a mall where they decide to live there. Also they lure and contain the dead so the place can be safe inside. There's also some subtext about mall shoppers as well in the movie. Even though mall are kind of dying today with all this online shopping now. They seem to enjoy the place and most of the movie I think is this. They also find out the girl is pregnant even though there's scenes of her smoking and drinking still. Then some bikers come by and try to raid the mall and Tom Savini's one of them too. The gore in this movie isn't too over the top like in Day of the Dead and I'm kind of glad. Then the guy, I think his name is Steve, gets shot, then bitten by the zombies. Black guy and girl then finish him off to save him from a fate worse than death when they get inside. The end I can say is a bit on the lighter note then in Night of the Living Dead I can tell you that. I also heard they did the movie at night when the mall was closed. Which would seem kind of hard if you think about it. Anyway this is a great movie and a classic regardless of the zombie craze. give it a watch if you can or not as scared easily.",Dawn of the Dead
200,neon47,A worthy follow-up,10,5 May 2006,"I can't help but ask myself: what if something like this really happened, what would I do? Sometimes I wish I could experience it, until then all I can do is watch George A. Romero's classic Dawn of the Dead. Picking up where Night of the Living Dead left off we see that the humans are not winning against the zombies. While they look like they're slaying the beasts, the truth is they're not doing it fast enough. People have been ordered to head to safe houses. A group of 4 decide to take a helicopter and try to find safety, but they run into a problem with fuel. Soon they decide to camp out in a mall for awhile after their helicopter almost reaches ""E"" again, and thus their problems only begin to manifest. George Romero's biggest talent is probably character conflict. His movies seem so much more real because not everyone in the movie gets a long. There's constant bickering and disagreements among the group, especially between the couple. The story is also well written, especially with the added character conflicts. The special effects are also very lovely, every kill is a portrait of brutality - lots of blood, just the way it's supposed to be. See this if you haven't. Classic!",Dawn of the Dead
201,veganflimgeek,Zombie masterpiece,9,7 April 2004,"I will never understand why Dawn of the dead was remade. Sure the film is far from perfect but this is the reason for it's charm. DAWN is a true nightmare of a film that is not a BOO invoking horror film but what that invokes a vision of a world gone totally insane. Romero is true independent filmmaker. While some of his films have had a small amounts of Hollywood bucks he has never sold out. He has been content to not make films rather sacrifice his vision. This unheard of but what do you expect from a man who said `I will never get tired of zombiesjust producers' .For arm chair critics who want to slam Romero and his films(OK I hated Knightriders) should consider what he had to work with. Sure it may not have been as pitch perfect as some glossy Hollywood film but the fun and passionate of the filmmakers is all over the screen in this film.Dawn is more than a zombie picture. It is an adventure and cool story about four desperate people who kinda live out a post apocalypse fantasy by seeking refuge in shopping mall. The zombies are not really the villains which is spelled out for those not keen to analogy which the pilot Steven explains that the zombies return to mall because it was a important part of there lives. `they don't even know why they came here'.Romero is cynical and doesn't make his zombies out to be anything but poor souls driven by instinct, The zombies are predictable it is not the zombies we are meant to fear. The negative aspects to the film come mostly from things that are really not that bad. OK the music is bad. I love the Goblins and the cheesy Italian horror movie music has charm at the time it is annoying.***Spoiler**** The music during the escape in the last scene is bad that it cannot be defended. In the DVD commentary track Romero admitted as much. On the new DVD the color and everything looks good but the blood looks pink and the digital re-master did not help the blood factor.",Dawn of the Dead
202,TheMichaelMyersMovieFanatic,Even though I don't think it's amazing it's absolutely worth a watch!,7,30 March 2021,"George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is often considered the best zombie movie of all time, so let's start off with my positives.The characters are all good. I think the movie does a great job of making the Mall feel isolated and claustrophobic and really putting the viewer in this situation. This is also the movie that made Tom Savini famous so you have to talk about the effects. Even though I don't think this is near his best work in terms of make up and special effects (and I'll get into that soon), he managed to create som really memorable scenes and a couple of great looking zombies. The helicopter scene would probably be my favorite effect. But honestly, this is not a prefect movie by any means. Let's get into the negatives.My biggest issue with this movie is by far the zombies. There are maybe 2 or 3 zombies that look good but the rest of them... Ugh. They are not scary at all, and most of that has to do with the green and purple makeup. I wasn't scared one single moment throughout this film and it really made some scenes drag. Except for the Goblin theme I also think the music is really out of place. And because of all these things there were some extreme pacing issues throughout. There were scenes that was supposed to be scary and intense but I didn't feel anything. Now the movie makes up for that with it's characters and drama but it seriously hurts the film for me.So overall I can see why this has become a classic, but it has not aged great. Still, I absolutely recommend it for the characters and the iconic mall setting and all of that, but don't go into it hoping to be terrified.I'm giving George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead a 6.5/10.",Dawn of the Dead
203,nathanjamesemerson,A fantastic sequel,10,24 September 2018,Dawn of the Dead is the sequel to George A Romero's masterpiece Night of the Living Dead.This movie is a masterpiece and is in a class all of its own. Again we have survivors facing a legion of the undead. This time the majority of the film takes places in a shopping mall.All of the characters are likeable. Except 'Flyboy' who I found extremely stupid and annoying. His actions throughout the film makes you scratch your head wondering what the idiot is doing. The legendary Ken Foree is the standout actor of the film as a badass soldier.The movie had lots of great special effects from the brilliant Tom Savini. There is lots of zombie action and several scenes of gore. Especially towards the end. Not only is this a horror film but it is also commentary on consumerism of the time as well. This is a trademark of George by adding some social commentary to his film.This movie may be a tad long but it is worth it. I prefer the extended cut personally which goes a lot longer then the theatrical version.If you are a zombie movie fan then this is a must watch,Dawn of the Dead
204,LagerLagerLagerShouting,The Best Zombie Film Ever.,8,1 May 2008,"A milestone in 1970's horror, Dawn of the Dead combines action, gore and social commentary to startling effect. Relentlessly entertaining from start to finish, the film represents one of the pivotal films of the American Nightmare era; post-Vietnam horrors that captured the fears and paranoia of the time. Here the terror is essentially consumerism in a decaying society. The physical horror stems from body takeover contradicting free-will and the bleakness of survival. Dawn of the Dead is probably George Romero's finest hour, he is yet to top this accomplished feat of film-making and this remains the jewel in the crown of his socially conscious zombie flicks.8/10",Dawn of the Dead
205,Jsimpson5,One of the best and goriest films I have ever seen,8,12 February 2007,"Basically this is a sequel to ""Night Of the Living Dead"", and in my opinion, of the best sequels ever made. Basically the story picks up a few weeks after the end of the first movie. The zombie problem is now world wide, and no one still seems to know what happened to cause it. Four people, a male pilot, a female news anchor woman, and 2 SWAT officers escape Philadelphia in an attempt to find an area that does not have zombies. Their journey takes them to the Monroeville Mall, in Monroeville PA. The mall is over run by zombies but finds items to help them survive.This is a fantastic film, and that is also ultra violent at the same time. The script is well written, and all of the actors have done a fine job in this film. Some of the special effects are corny, and some of the stuff is so fake looking (like the African American man getting his heads blown off, by the bigot SWAT officer). But considering when this film was made, this was pretty much the best that could be done of the budget that they had to use.I will say this thought, this film is NOT for everyone. If you don't like violence in general, do not watch this film. If you dislike guns, do not watch this film. If you do not like gore, or anything related to it, please for all means stay away from this film. I would also advised that if you are young (I would say about 17 or under) for the love of god, do not watch this film. You may get spooked or have night mares. Beyond what I just said in the last paragraph, this is a incredible film to watch if you are in the horror/zombie genre of films. So do your self a favor and buy this film and watch it.",Dawn of the Dead
206,donuthaters12,A Great Zombie Flick Despite A Few Flaws,8,28 October 2013,"George A. Romero is heralded by many as the pioneer of the zombie genre and I for one have not heard of any other filmmaker that has made this much of an impact in the horror genre other than Romero. Dawn of the Dead is the first film I have from his work but I have seen the 2004 remake which I thought was good.The film was written by George A. Romero and my I felt that the writing was the reason that brought this film down. Romero was so focused on writing a great plot that the dialogue was suffered because of this. The dialogue in this film is a hit and miss for me as some of the dialogue felt too straight forward and simple that it doesn't add any personality to the character, in the beginning in particular. I enjoy the fact that Romero starts the film swiftly straight to the point with the problem already progressed significantly that the stakes are immediately high. The banter between the two men about the existence of these beings and how we can diffuse the situation. The first few minutes of the film did feel like a drag in its plot and dialogue, but when they arrived at the shopping mall then the film started to pick up and it starts to become very exciting and entertaining. Romero does try to incorporate the relation of zombies to the current society, implying that we have become victims of consumerism. This concept is very interesting and forward thinking as it still applies to societies today.Romero's direction for this film is very two sided as he wanted to make a horror film and a black comedy. The horror is fueled through slow psychological horror, as we know that the zombies are out there and they do have the potential to get in but even at their slow pace they feel even more frightening. The comedy definitely was great here as it didn't feel awkward or out of place. The funniest of moments are the shots that focuses on their faces as they don't always look that terrifying but rather it feels like an exaggerated emotion. Romero wasn't trying to make something epic but instead the terror comes from the most intimate and claustrophobic scenes. Night of the Living Dead had a much smaller budget so I assume that he was limited by budget and cannot fully express the vision in his mind. Dawn of the Dead had a bigger budget and Romero decided to do all out with the film filled with violent scenes, abundant with special effects; which I thought could be a bit tiring but rather it gave the film this personality that attracts me to revisit it in the future.The film was shot by Michael Gornick who doesn't have a lot films in his catalog. The film's cinematography is not fantastic but it does do it's job well. The image is quite warm and feels quite upbeat, which is very ironic. This kind of film would have been a great opportunity to create something incredibly dark and terrifying but this would conflict with the comedy that Romero was going for. Gornick and Romero have chosen to the camera to have shots to be very set in place or have minimal movements as this adds to the frightening feeling of the zombies coming closer and keeps the audience feeling helpless in looking away from the gore and horror, which is a decision I admire a lot.Dario Argento and The Goblins are credited as the composers for this film and they did a pretty good job here. I enjoyed the use of synthesizer in the score which I thought was pretty unique for the zombie genre. The score may be a bit melodramatic but it does add on to the weight of the plot and supports the tone of terror that Romero wanted to show. In delivering the comedy of the film, half of it comes from the elevator/shopping mall music that plays as the zombies casually walks around the mall. This approach had me laughing until the end of the credits and does leave the film with a lighter tone.There are only really 4 actors that drives the film and for the most part, they are all great in portraying their parts. These roles are not the deepest of written characters but the actors do what they can with what they are given. David Emge was good here especially heading towards the second half of the film. Ken Foree was good playing as the badass protector but at the same time he does show hints of vulnerability that makes the character feel human and not just another killing machine like the zombies. Scott Reiniger and Gaylen Ross were good but I felt they didn't stack as high as the other two actors in their roles. Foree and Emge showed a much better performance in their physical acting making the stressful scenes feel believable.Dawn of the Dead may be heralded as an instant classic for some and it's flaws that I see maybe seen as a great aspect of the film but it just didn't work with me.",Dawn of the Dead
207,canadude,This is the creme de la creme of zombie horror,10,29 March 2004,"I recently decided to watch this movie again (with the remake out there and whatnot) and did so with an unusual skepticism. Or at least initially. My approach had to do with my belief that I had simply enjoyed the movie the first time because I saw it as a little kid and it excited my imagination in the way any dumb horror movie would. I was wrong.Romero's Dawn of the Dead is a great horror movie; in fact one of the best. First off, it serves as a phenomenal following to Night of the Living Dead (now, a masterpiece in minimalist horror), because it is precisely that: a following, not a sequel. While it possesses certain characteristics of a sequel, namely a larger setting, bigger proportions, a bloodier canvas, a heavier budget and (last but not least) color, it doesn't really recycle the original story. It takes the zombies and creates an entirely different approach to them. By ""different"" I mean pretty much similar except for the fact that the little shack in Night becomes a mall in Dawn. And this opens it to such possibilities you cannot even imagine until you see it. Thus, Dawn of the Dead stands easily on its own. In fact, the ideas here are in some way more daring than in the original which was simply a superbly gritty horror. Dawn of the Dead is pure guts and playful social satire. It's got zombies galore and such beautiful death inflicted upon them. It's got hardcore realism in terms of psychology; part of its horror is watching the interactions between its four main characters and their growing loss of hope. The way Romero shoots it reeks of realism, despite the absurdity of the context of the story. What do I mean? I mean that we see real chaos, and we grow to believe it too, despite the fact that it all revolves around a bunch of dead people who purportedly came from hell which reached its population maximum. No vacancy. The battle of evil versus good thus takes place on earth. Only in Romero's film it ain't as simple as good versus evil because it's hard as hell (no pun intended) to figure out who's really good. Morality sort of fades. And the main characters struggle. For normalcy, really and a home. Some basics. Like clothes, food and a TV. Meanwhile, hordes of zombies are eerily drawn to the mall; some pre-death, pre-damnation memory. Consumerism does mean things to you, states Romero. Real mean things - dominates the subconscious part of your mind so bad that even after you die and go to hell (and come back from it to eat human flesh) you still want inside the mall. So the main characters must struggle with that too. And that yields pure adrenaline and terror; orgiastic splashes of violence; black AND morbid humor. In short, a great, fast-paced story laced with zombie death. And an ending that outdoes the literal fatalism of Night and the decadently stupid ""movie runs into credits so the audience sits in the seats"" ending of the remake. Dawn of the Dead ends like grey sunrises: quietly, ambiguously (though leaning towards the ominous) and inevitably.",Dawn of the Dead

209,jerralagbayani,Enough Humor and Zombie Action to Make the World go 'round!,8,6 January 2018,"To be honest I find this movie more entertaining than the first movie(Night of the Living Dead) for a few reasons: Humor, Action, and Plot. 
The humor really filled in the quieter or not so important moments and somewhat showed the main character's traits in a way. The humor honestly made me laugh a little and makes the film a whole lot better.
The action was more entertaining than the first because they had more ground to cover and more threats than the first. This sorta relates to the plot of the story because like the summary says, a group of survivors bunker down in a shopping mall over the onslaught of zombies(or something like that).
A solid 8/10 because it has dawned on me maybe the people from the first movie shouldn't have drawn much attention on themselves when they were boarding up and when night came they should've turned off all the lights and quietly waited it out in the basement with a weapon in hand just in case. The people were smarter in Dawn of the Dead because when they first entered the mall they chose which room would be safer and dealt with hiding it from the zombies by covering the door leading to the room(is that a spoiler?).",Dawn of the Dead

A wonderfully atmospheric setting (always necessary for a good horror), sympathetic characters and the tiny problem of being surrounded by flesh eaters in a mall packed with everything you could ever want. Great tension throughout with the clock always ticking. Romero has a field day with some great scenes making use of the venue. Apart from this the film also has a another layer about consumerism. Are we not all zombies wandering around bland malls buying things we do not really need? A film made by a director who understands a thing or two about storytelling.

The beginning is sweet...it totally starts off subject but it really starts to wind in very well. I thought the beginning was pretty freaky the first time i saw it. For the rest of the movie it is everyones dream(other than the zombies). They take refuge at a place everyone loves to go. I wont say anything because im not one to spoil movies but just because of the place they stay it is very unique. Romero's genious with the violent rages of the zombies are excellent. The effects are really good. Sometimes you forget youre actually watching a zombie flick and think youre watching faces of death.

Well it is close to 20 years later and I now own every version I can find on DVD.Dawn of The dead is one of the few horror films made that can reel you into the story and make you have real feeling about the characters and the trials that they go through. This film has a mix of Humor, Action, Drama, and of course GORE. If I could pick one scene that makes this film stand out, it would be when the four hero's were standing on the upper level and Ken Foree said that magical line that can still send a shiver down your spine. ""When theres no More Room In HELL, the DEAD will walk the EARTH."" That was and still is to me the most memorable line in the film. That scene alone was a very powerful moment in the film.

It's got several good scares, lots of suspense and just the right amount of gore.  Not only is the movie not overly gory but the gore that is in it is very creative and strengthens the movie.MINOR SPOILERS!!!The real reason I like this movie so much is that the characters do exactly what they should do.  They find a place to hide out and rid said place of zombies so they can go back to a ""normal"" way of living.  Of course things don't stay perfect for long.This is a very smart movie and benefits from it's ""long"" running time.  I've heard a lot of detractors of this movie state that it's too long.  Most of these people probably have short attention spans and don't understand the significance of characterization.  Luckily for horror fans George Romero understands not only suspense but characterization as well.Like the Star Wars trilogy, Romero's Dead trilogy reaches it's peak with the middle movie.  Night of... is a nice introduction to the series and Day of... closes out things well, but it's Dawn of the Dead that brings the most to the trilogy.  It's the place where hope for the future and foreboding doom are nicely balanced.Dawn of the Dead is a strong 9 out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead

If it's your favorite movie, then good for you-- your opinion is every bit as valid as mine or anyone else's.  But just to break the monotony of the almost universally positive user comments for this film, I now contribute my opinion.  Dawn of the Dead is one of the most awful movies I have ever seen. It left me stunned and speechless and thoroughly convinced it was the worst film of all time; I've since seen worse movies (like George Romero's Knightriders and the Night of the Living Dead remake), but my distaste for Dawn remains unchanged.  It is pointless, sloppy, unrealistic garbage that drags on and on despite numerous moments when they could easily have ended the film and shown everyone mercy.  But no, they have to tack on more plot developments (like the biker gang that randomly shows up) just so we can suffer for another half hour.  And the main characters are too stupid for us to relate with them-- one of them doesn't even know what a mall is, and then they steal money from the bank even though civilization has fallen apart and they can just take whatever they want from the mall anyway.  The acting is equally awful, particularly the helicopter pilot and the bikers.  Mix in some painfully obvious continuity mistakes (the disappearing zombies next to the exploding car, the scene where Roger gets drenched in zombie blood that vanishes in the next shot) and you've got one of the few genuinely awful movies.  Films like this achieve a kind of dark grandeur-- it's not easy to make movies this bad, but somehow Romero pulls it off again and again (something must have happened to him right after he made the great original Night of the Living Dead).  Odds are you'll probably like this film for whatever reason everybody else has for liking it.  But if you watch it and hate every stupid, repulsive moment, take comfort-- you're not alone.",Dawn of the Dead
217,Speechless,Have you all gone insane?,1,18 January 2001,"Dawn of the Dead is positively one of the worst films ever made.  Yes, it is.  It's worse than Manos the Hands of Fate, worse than Severed Ties, worse than Battlefield Earth, worse than Igor and the Lunatics... worse than just about any movie you could name.  It redefined my conception of how bad a movie could actually be.There's nothing here.  There's no horror, no poignant social satire, no scathing attack on American consumer culture.  How can these characters be making some kind of a statement about American society when they're so stupid they don't even know what a shopping mall is?  Look at them--they're dumb enough to steal money from a bank even though society has completely fallen apart and they can get anything they need from the mall anyway!  And what kind of social commentary can you attach to that awful scene where the biker gang throws pies into the zombies' faces?  Or the utterly useless racketball scene?  Or the completely inappropriate Pac-Man musical score? Dawn of the Dead is NOT a socially relevant film.  It's just two very long hours of garbage--ugly, poorly acted, ludicrous garbage. 
I've tried to like this movie, I really have.  But there's nothing worthwhile in it.  It's not scary, it's not entertaining, and it's not meaningful.  It's just a sad, painfully misguided waste of time.  Heaven save us from George Romero and his alien brainwashing ray.",Dawn of the Dead

How is it that 42 years ago, people couldn't act? The dialog is insanely stupid, the premises are ridiculous. I wonder if Romero watched this and thought to himself, ""This is so stupid, let's try to make it a comedy to cover up for it. Then other morons like me will love it.""",Dawn of the Dead

I must say that I liked the remake version of this movie (with Ving Rhames) a LOT better, but that's probably because of the ""Post-28 Days Later Zombie Syndrome"" where things move much faster and are much scarier for your present-day movie goers who are numbed by scarier and gorier movies every day. (wow that was a long run-on sentence). Anyway, the acting was still a bit hokey, and people still do VERY stupid things that get themselves killed (then again, if they didn't, the slow moving zombies wouldn't be able to kill anyone). I did like the social commentary in this movie a bit better than the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"", but overall as a movie, it was just above average. Some of the scenes do not make sense at all (like the beginning ""raid"" and the strange ending), but it's definitely worth watching if you want to see an old school ""zombie"" movie with a soul.",Dawn of the Dead

How often have you and your friends hypothesised about where you would hole up in the case of invasion ? Zombies or otherwise, the fantasy of being left to run wild in a deserted shopping centre is brought to the fore here.The cultivation of that thought in the audience, really shows us how much we do think about these places and how much they mean to us. Its just another facet of the critique of consumerism that is the films backbone. Horror or sci-fi is always improved when just this kind of allegory is employed , so the film can comment as well as entertain.This is a film which is so eminently watchable, it can be almost compulsive viewing, with every re-watching some new meaning or previously untapped thought comes through.

221,JamesMovieGuy_117,a must see for horror buffs!,8,13 July 2018,"A sequel to Night of the Living Dead, a group of people are held up in a shopping mall but this time they have the advantage. They're armed, have much more knowledge about the living dead and have enough resources to survive. However, they realise this paradise in a post-apocalyptic world has much more of a burden on them than they think.Dawn of the Dead has to be one of the most loved zombie films of all time and for good reason. Coming out in the late 1970's, the profound social statements made in this film extended upon the racial metaphor of the first film. The mindless zombies represented our obedience to consumerist society and the characters temptation to live in this utopia was an obvious social statement on the society of the time.Tom Savini after collaborating with George A. Romero on Martin, did the make-up effects and performed stunts for the film. The zombies have a blue look to them and the blood is bright red like most films from the 70's. However, Savini creates some legitimately gruesome effects which were unprecedented for the time and paved the way for lots of censorship in different parts of the world.George A. Romero ramps up the stakes with the sequel and the shopping mall setting evokes that sense of vulnerability unlike the first film which was very isolated. His direction creates suspense and thrills that will leave you on the edge of your seat!Dawn of the Dead is an excellent horror satire that's a must see for horror buffs!",Dawn of the Dead

Even the soundtrack comes courtesy of Argento's resident electro-goth soundkillers Goblin.And lawd-nose Mr. Argento can safely be said to have the most twisted sense of humor SINCE the director of the freakout flick that Mr. Duncan cites by way of likeminded comparison, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls instigator Russ Meyer (tho it should be noted that film's script by nascent critic Roger Ebert deserves at least half the praise).Romero's sense of humor -- such as it seems -- has never progressed much beyond his jaded 1988 ""Experiment in Horror"" known as Monkey Shines, ie ""When in doubt, hire a monkey,"" a Hollywood mansion-saver that even Clint Eastwood has succumbed to. Notwithstanding Romero's supervisory capacity over occasional chuckles buried within episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Masters of Horror (probably also more due to collaborators than Romero's own soggy so-called wit) --",Dawn of the Dead
225,scarecrowman,A Horror Film with all the ingredients.,10,24 April 2003,"""Dawn"" is by far the best of George Romero's three (so far) Living Dead films.  ""Night"" accomplished more for it's time.  For all out fun, however ""Dawn"" is the ticket.  It may or may not pick up where ""Night"" left off. Most fans argue that point, but it really doesn't matter.  This film was an absolute onslaught on Hollywood.  Tom Savini's zombies are impressive at worst.  The make-up in this film is what separated Savini from the rest of the make-up and creature creators. The strength of this film lies in what I consider the most brilliant living dead atmosphere ""The Mall"".  Who would've thought that.  Romero did. That setting is what makes this film so out right entertaining.  ""Dawn"" is dramatic, at times scary, bloody, and even funny which are the proper ingredients for a Horror film.Dawn of The Dead:  ""10 crows out of 10 mutilated!""",Dawn of the Dead
226,derekauthor,The Original 'Dead',10,26 August 2005,"Almost better than ""Night of the Living Dead,"" George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" is scarier, a lot more action-packed, and even funny.The film focuses on four friends who go to a shopping mall where they barricade themselves, with plenty of flesh-eating zombies outside. The friends are Philadelphia SWAT team members Roger (Scott Reiniger) and Peter (Ken Foree), and traffic reporter Steven (David Emge) and his girlfriend, Francine (Gaylen Ross).The zombies aren't very scary, but it was the way Romero set up the sequences featuring the walking dead that makes them so scary. What also made the film so scary was of the concept that some mysterious worldwide plague has caused the dead to come back to life, therefore beginning to create the end of the world. In other words, the film works very well as an apocalyptic thriller.Another great thing about this film is how Romero was able to use satire with horror, where he commented about consumerism. The zombies represented the people who wanted consumers to ""join them"" in terms of acting like them and eventually becoming one of them, or ""buying into it.""""Dawn of the Dead"" works on a lot of levels. It can be seen as a social satire, horror film, sometimes a comedy, an action/adventure film, and even a drama at times.",Dawn of the Dead

228,Colonel Ted,The gore keeps you watching,6,25 February 2000,"George A. Romero was the Orson Welles of zombie flicks. It also seems rather sad that 10 years after his debut, Night of the Living Dead, he was still making the same schlock. This sequel to his debut doesn't scare in the year 2000, but still possesses some threatening tension and eye-popping gore that keeps you watching as four people occupy a department store to shelter from the zombies that are steadily taking over the world. This in itself has been seen as an attack on American consumerism as the zombies return to a place that was so important to them while they were still `alive', but the main attraction is the bloodletting, limb eating and brain spurting that comes by the truckload. The film is overlong and rather draggy and dull in a few too many places but on the whole it's good gory fun. 6/10",Dawn of the Dead
229,brainofj72,The Greatest Zombie Movie of All-Time,9,1 September 2005,"When George A. Romero first shocked moviegoers back in 1968, it was with ""Night of the Living Dead"", a dark, brutal zombie film saturated with atmospheric black and white cinematography and unflinching gore, which was quite unheard of at the time.So audiences may have been somewhat surprised when they saw Romero's follow-up, ""Dawn of the Dead"" in 1978. The suspense factor has been turned down considerably, the eerie atmosphere (largely due to the gorgeous B&W cinematography) is all but gone, and the cynical commentary on human nature has been replaced with a rather different, though still somewhat cynical explication of mankind, which I'll get to later.First, the story. ""Dawn"" supposedly takes place right after the events of ""Night"", even though Romero has made no effort to hide the progression of fashion from the '60s to the '70s. The film centers around four people: Francine (Ross), a headstrong woman trying to prove her worth; Stephen (Emge), a helicopter pilot and also Francine's boyfriend; Peter (Foree), a laid-back SWAT team member; and Roger (Reiniger), a rowdy and at times juvenile SWAT team member. After Francine and Stephen escape a chaotic TV studio and Peter and Roger survive a brutal raid, the four of them take to the sky in a chopper to find some kind of refuge from the ever-growing zombie epidemic that is engulfing the planet. What they find is a sprawling shopping mall that has been abandoned by everyone except a substantial amount of undead denizens. They land, grab some supplies, and, eventually, make the mall their home.As I said earlier, ""Night"" featured some very cynical social commentary on human nature, but Romero has moved on to what's bugging him now: modern consumerism. The zombies in the mall are meant to represent the raving masses as they flock to shopping centers to buy things they don't need. This is made rather obvious at many points in the film, especially during this exchange: -Francine: ""What are they (the zombies) doing? Why do they come here (the mall)?"" -Stephen: ""Some kind of instinct, memory of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives."" Is there even any doubt as to what Romero was trying to say?But don't worry, horror fans, for while Romero was layering in all his clever little metaphors and commentaries, he didn't forget the one important little element that makes ""Dawn of the Dead"" so infamous: gore. ""Night"" was nothing compared to this. We're talking graphic, unrelenting, envelope-destroying zombie carnage, complete with beheadings, disembowlings, and more than enough head-shots to go around, including one particularly memorable scene where a zombie loses his entire head due to a shotgun blast. While the blood itself looks extremely fake, Tom Savini's groundbreaking make-up effects more than make up for it. In fact, the candy-colored blood actually adds a certain indefinable something to the film, as it tends to focus more on macabre humor than actual horror and suspense.The acting is cheesy and rather poor, but this IS a 1970s zombie film. The dialogue is at times decent and at times laughable (in a good way, sort of). The Goblin's score is, like the acting and dialogue, cheesy, but still manages to create a certain appeal. It grows on you, trust me. The direction is quite good most of the time and maintains a very cohesive visual feel throughout the 127 minute running time (or 139 if you're watching the extended version, or 119 if you're watching Dario Argento's cut). But the flaws I mentioned are minor and can most certainly be overlooked due to the film's good qualities, which are staggeringly high.The recent surge of zombie films has yielded some good (28 Days Later) and some bad (Dawn of the Dead (2004)) results, but no modern film full of sprinting undead will ever surpass ""Dawn of the Dead"", a true classic and the quintessential zombie film that will reign supreme for years upon years to come.9/10",Dawn of the Dead

The film is one of those rare movies that is actually better than its original, which is almost as good.2 SWAT members, and a young couple are seek refuge in a mall during a zombie apocalypse. George Romero made this as a satire of consumer culture, and he did a fine job. The survivors are the rich and the zombies are the poor.The zombies sometimes made me laugh, walking stiff and are painted with white faces. I heard this film was also low budget but Romero, yet again, done a fantastic job without all of the fancy funding.This film was more of an action film than horror.

More than most movies, the violent images stuck with me, and the creepiness of the plot disturbed me. Recently, I saw it again, and realized I had missed out on the real theme of the story. Maybe even the filmmakers themselves didn't realize the deep meaning...until...BLACK Friday!! That's right....Black Friday, that over-hyped, media celebrated circus of mindless American consumerism, wherein hordes of numb materialistic shoppers rush to malls, climbing over each other, even lurking in dark parking lots all night to feast on...whatever.Dawn of the Dead is way too far ahead of its time. The story of four survivors of a mysterious plague who battle zombies for control of a shopping mall might hit a little too close to home. But it never misses. Funny, suspenseful, violent (but really lousy blood spattered effects ) its got everything you need for everyone in the family.

232,Shinwa,Apocalypse in the Food Court,9,31 October 2000,"Thoughtful if unsubtle epic follow-up to Night of the Living Dead was one of THE influential movies of the late 70's; pity, then, that the people it influenced paid more attention to the amped-up gore than to the sense of contained hysteria that makes what should be tough going (there are basically three scenes in this movie: zombies attack people, people attack zombies, people stand around talking) a uniquely involving and provocative self-analysis of the zombie film.The symbolism is, well, not delicate. Just in case we missed it the first time, the trope that the mall attracts the zombies ""because it was an important place to them"" is repeated for our rumination. But the overall sustained atmosphere, inside and outside of the banal environment of the shopping mall, is by far the film's salient contribution; even when there is no obvious action onscreen, there is the threat of an attack to come, and the clock is clearly ticking on the four protagonists during their idyll. Moreover, it takes the conspicuously familiar and catapults it into an apocalyptic situation, creating a powerful sense of displacement.The violence, which is primarily what draws people to or repels them from this movie, comes on strong, but quickly becomes monotonous (as it is, the vast majority of the violence in the movie is inflicted against the zombies rather than by them, though is none the less repulsive for that); the scariest part of the movie is how plausible it makes the concept of total disintegration of what we perceive as civilization. The soundtrack, highlighting pulsing, insistent synthesizer chords, contributes much to the onscreen tension, which the action choreography is exemplary. An unlikely masterpiece.",Dawn of the Dead

Mindless zombies wander aimlessly through a muzak-filled shopping mall with ritual devotion while a group of ""livings"" set up house in the upper levels, still clinging to their materialistic values despite a world run amuck with dead things.  If you see only one zombie film in your lifetime, this would have to be the one, though you could hardly go wrong with the other two installments in Romero's flawless trilogy.  Many lesser talents, most notably Italian schlockmeisters Bruno Mattei and Lucio Fulci, have tried to emulate Romero's genius and failed miserably in the process.

Unfortunately, the enjoyment stopped short after the first installment.DAWN OF THE DEAD did nothing to impress or even entertain me. The story is essentially the same as that of its predecessor, just reworked a bit. This time there are people trapped in a shopping mall instead of a house, and the zombies are still running amok. There is one big difference though... this movie sucks.I'm told the main source of terror in this movie is supposed to be the zombies? What a joke. You can see how easily the zombies can be fought off. They're so weak and slow-moving that you can literally just shove them right off you. Anybody that allows the zombies to catch up to them must be as weak and slow-moving as they are... or just stupid.There is nothing menacing or frightening about these zombies--and that's probably what made DAWN OF THE DEAD so boring and awful for me. If I were locked in that shopping mall, I wouldn't be the least bit afraid. Even though I'm not a very good shot, I could easily kill the zombies way before they reached me. If they reached me before I got a chance to shoot them, I could push them away and then shoot them. Seriously. In the remake, the zombies are at least fast and stronger. That's scarier.DAWN OF THE DEAD would have been good otherwise. The actors aren't terribly impressive, but they pull it off. The script flows pretty well, and the direction and execution is acceptable. It's just those damn zombies that ruin it.This movie isn't the least bit scary, and it's categorized as a ""horror"" movie. A ""horror classic,"" in fact.

240,aakash-karkare,Zombies,9,27 October 2010,"I have developed this sudden fascination with Zombies, the undead or the living dead. And who better to learn about Zombies from then Georger A. Romero.He has made 6 zombie movies. From 1968 to 2010. The godfather of the zombie as he is called has given zombies their trademarks that have been use over and over again in other movies, have been parodied and spoofed, reused and recycled. The slow walking zombies, cutting of their heads will be the only thing that kills them, they are not cannibals but feed only on humans.While Night of the living Dead was a very good movie there was something missing in that movie. The scope of story telling was limited since it was told from the point of view of some people all trapped inside a house. Although it spoke volumes of race relations and rich/poor divide there was still more that could have been done.And that is exactly what happened in Romero's Dawn of the Dead. A brilliant accomplishment in horror films. The basic premise is simple. A group has a helicopter and they decide to fly all the way to Canada with it. They have to keep stopping for gas so finally they get tired and make their house in a mall. From their they slowly build a fortress and begin to settle there.They theorize why the mall is filled with Zombies. One of them says that "" It's in their memory , they came here earlier and now it's just a follow up of that."" Later there is a very good scene when all the zombies break into the interior of the mall are shown walking into the designer wear, the toys and various other merchandise as if they still remember that they are consumers. Their humanity is forgotten but the consumerism lives on.Dawn of the Dead gives credence to the horror genre as a cinematic accomplishment in its own right. Where people would criticize horror as nothing but an exercise in ""gotchya moments"" as Ebert calls them horror movie began to be reviewed with other films. But Dawn of the Dead is not just a horror film. It is much more. It is a film that talks about how much our minds are filled with buying things. How the human beings will not lose hope in times of Apocalypse because the human spirit always will have the power to fight. And above all "" When the dead walk, señores, we must stop the killing... or lose the war. """,Dawn of the Dead
241,m_jordan_jones,One of the best movies I've ever seen. (May contain spoilers),9,16 March 2005,This is a cool movie. Filled with great special effects and good acting. Everything about this film is awesome. Every film that George A. Romero makes is great. Night of the living dead was good. Day of the dead was the best. Dawn of the dead takes a close second though. I can't wait till Romero makes his new movie Land of the dead. That looks awesome. Dawn of the dead is filled with plenty of mindless gore and violence. The coolest scene is where a zombie get's his head chopped in half and you can see his brain leaking out blood. One fault to this film is that it gets kind of boring at times. If you haven't watched Dawn of the dead yet then go buy it right now. I rate this film a 9/10. Those who say that this movie is stupid obviously don't know good horror films.,Dawn of the Dead
242,Chris J.,Much more than a great gore film!,10,12 November 1998,"Romero could have simply done a variation on his Night of the Living Dead, with better effects, a little more budget to work with, and good (for the time) Tom Savini special effects.He did much more than this.  He propels us into a world gone mad.  Where the living dead zombies are real threats to civilizaion as we know it, but also benign creatures that can also be diversions for many citizens who take sport in shooting them in the head.But there is a real crisis.  There's too many zombies and they are winning the war.Besides the horror and the gore which is extreme in the film's first 20 and last 40 minutes and sporadic in between, there are many social comments Romero makes.Sure some of them regarding consumerism and commercialism are quite obvious,but others regarding social structures and human nature aren't.This is after all a gore film, right?

Who else would have thought to use a whole shopping mall for half of a zombie flick?  The originality of it is amazing, and it lends a lot to the movie itself, especially when the biker gang (lead by the S/X genius Tom Savini) starts flying in and gets into a pitched battle with the survivors and zombies all at once.And yes, the plot in this film is actually good too.  By the end you really care if these characters survive, which can be thanked to good character development.  Yet still in the last shot you realize the hopelessness of their situation and the question ""where will they go next"" is begged to be asked.All in all, I highly recommend this film.

244,butterman_1999,Nothing can be said that hasn't already been said...,8,13 August 2019,"As the title of this ""review"" (more of a comment, really) suggests, there isn't much more anyone can say now (in 2019) about this true classic of the horror genre, which hasn't been already more properly discussed.I thing that there are many reasons why this film is reguarded by some as ""the"" quintessential zombie/living dead movie, and why it also seems to be a question of ""hype"" to those who grew up in the post-Y2K age of zombie revival.Granted, the movie has aged, and some of the makeup and effects did not photograph well on film. Yes, in some instances, I can actually understand why younger viewers who grew up with the ""Resident Evil"" video games and the 2004 remake of ""Dawn Of The Dead"" would view this as a low-budget cheap/fake boring action-less ""talkie"", instead of the zombie ""classic"" it has come to be viewed by some. Yes, the zombies can be unconvincing, and yes, the blood may look way too fake, but that's the way the cookie crumbles at times, especially when ressources and budgetary limitation play a large part of how a film's overall ""tonal look"", especially concerning special effects (pre-CGI of course).I am also quite sure that today's younger audience may also view the commentary / satire about consumerism to be either heavy-handed, or just not that much of a big deal. After all, compared to how media and over commercialism was ""present"" in our daily lives versus how it is today, it's no Wonder that the ""satire"" may proove inneficient to some, who have gotten used to being over-exposed by LED-lit animated billboards at every step, ads on every webpage, and algorythm autobots automatically re-sorting their F4cebo0k feeds and custom-selected advertisements. Compared to how we are quite literally drowned in ads in today's world, the late 70s must have seemed like a ""dead zone"", and thus could make it seem as though the social commentary in ""Dawn"" isn't justified.However, much like I read somewhere that ""(Orwell)'s 1984 was a warning, not an instruction manual"", Romero's ""Dawn"" also served not so much as a warning but a ""current"" viewpoint at where our north american society(ies) were heading towards. By the time ""Dawn"" hit the theaters, shopping malls weren't uncommon anymore and therefore the film also served as a sort of real-life/real-time almost mirror image of what the pre-80s consumerism was beginning to be. Interestingly enough, I first saw the poster for ""Dawn"" at a shopping mall's cinema, in the days long before the mega super multiplexes, and having a theater with two screens was quite a feat!Anyway as I said, there really is Nothing new I could add on the subject, save for my own opinion that I may do believe that ""Dawn"" is my favorite of all the ""Living Dead"" films, because of numerous reasons, such as, but not limited to, the very believable acting and dialogue, the humour which breaks the bleak and serious tone of such an apocalypse, the Goblin soundtrack which adds an air of strange, uncomfortable surrealism, and of course the evolution / arcs of the characters, how they deal with these circumstances.I remember seeing a TV advert for the film way back in the late 70s (so I was just Under the age of 8 or 9 or so) which literally traumatized me, but my conscious mind had repressed where these images came from, so it wasn't until I was slightly older and rented a VHS copy of the film for home viewing (back then, a rating of 18+ meant no one under 18 would be admitted reguardless) that I realized these images which had plagued me were from ""Dawn Of The Dead"", and to this day, some of these still haunt me.To trully appreciate this film I would recommend you hunt down the 4-DVD box set which features various cuts of the film as well as a wealth of bonus and behind the scènes features, and then immerse yourself in the world that Romero created, like a snapshot of the late 70s coming to close, envisioning what our future was possibly hinting at, at the time.... Then after that, if you hunger for more, be sure to Watch the 1985 follow-up, ""Day Of The Dead"", a film equally strong although with darker themes and maybe with less ""in your face"" social commentary and humor...",Dawn of the Dead
245,RElKO,A flesh-eating classic.,10,26 July 2000,"This is undoubtably one my top 3 horror movies of all time. Because if you wade through all the blood and guts there's a great movie as well. This is no movie just interested in trying to shock people by grabbing any chance to show exploding heads, flesheating ghouls and dismembering motorcycle gangmembers, it's trying to bring a message across about human nature at it's worst, society, inhumain behavior from large corporations and governments and so on. Four people, three men and one woman, flee to a shopping mall by helicopter when the place they are is gradually overrun by zombies. Although the shopping mall is crawling with the undead as well, they realize this is the best place to manage to survive for a long while. After clearing out the mall of it's zombies, they even manage to fool themselves into thinking they can lead a relatively normal life, until there's the brute invasion of the mall by a gung ho motorcycle gang (lead by Tom Savini himself), who obviously don't worry to much about the nasty flesheaters, casually dismembering and mutilating the zombies along the way as if it were a favorite passtime. Their underestimation of the undead ultimately leads to the demise of the gang, and the ""safe"" hideout of the thinned out group of helicopter passengers.If you can't deal with unmerciless bloodletting and gore, do not see this movie. If you can, this is one of the best movies you're likely to see, even besides the fantastic make up effects. The music score by Goblin, although a bit cheesy, is very effective and even chilling at times. The acting is pretty good, considering these are all unknown actors, although i've seen Ken Foree (the black special forces police officer) from time to time. The settings (the shopping mall) are the best possible setting you could have for a movie like this. Just think about how great an idea it would be to seek refuge there if this was a real-life situation. Especially effective is the scene where the survivors think they can lead normal lives in the shopping mall, only to find out they're fooling themselves, because the zombies won't go away if you just try to forget them.The violence, once again, is gory and gruesome. But the makers of the movie kept the gore reasonable, and weren't just out to make people sick as a lot of Italian movies try to do.A must see for all who love horror.",Dawn of the Dead

Truly a harrowing experience, it is a political statement of the dangers of compacency, a great fable of survival, and a very frightening gore fest. It is one of the very few horror films that can stand up to the great Drama's. It is that good. If you like horror films none will ever match this one. It is a unique film, both sensitive, and vulgar, and still manages to genuinely scare.",Dawn of the Dead

The zombies are so funny when they just walk around aimlessly in the mall. They say the funniest things, and sometimes they're funny when they're trying to be serious!Even though it is funny, it is a total bloodbath. Blood and guts fly almost every scene. The scenes where the zombies eat people's flesh are almost too gross to watch.  The weak of stomach will cringe. Don't eat when you watch DotD!Over-all I give it a 8/10.

Before delving into this film, I have really only watched one zombie film which was 28 Days Later and I once I finally got to watch this film, I was stoked especially after hearing all the praise through the years.And I have to say this movie exceeded my expectations. Despite the low budget, it was not at all a detriment to the movies quality. Although slow in movement, zombies can be quite a problem when their numbers are high. There is a great deal of suspense in this movie bound to entertain even the casual movie fan, but what I really loved about this film is its uniqueness and what I'm specifically talking about is what can add weight to a horror film in my opinion.What I am talking about is its setting. Having the movie take place in a shopping mall is complete utter genius. While it not only adds a fun factor (and a few comedic elements), it also feels very isolated and claustrophobic. The setting also creates unique scenarios that the characters must adapt to by thinking of what to do in order to protect themselves, but what it really accomplishes with having a mall infested with zombies is serving as a perfect backdrop to modern society.The film satirizes bourgeious culture perfectly and having it be a zombie is what, in my humble opinion, makes it awesome. Never have I envisioned a horror film work like this from different angles. This movie will entertain those looking for an enjoyable film to watch casually, but it will also be appreciated by the forward thinkers. A must have for any film fanatic's collection. Classic.",Dawn of the Dead
251,Mileskolehmainen,I am sure this is one of the best zombie movies i will ever see.,10,29 July 2014,"DAWN OF THE DEAD***** 4.7/5.0I think it's pretty amazing that Dawn of the Dead's small crew, with a very low budget and limited resources, could make this film so good. Tom Salvini's effects are disturbing and convincing, The actors (including zombies) are great, The script is pretty much free of cheesy dialog, And the film's atmosphere manages to do something that most films can not: To maintain horror and fun at the same time, this is one of the things that improves it from Night. Another thing that sets apart from other zombie movies is the sly satire. It can be seen many different ways, or just unnoticed, so i think viewers with opposing views will have less of a problem with it than with other satirical films. I haven't seen very many zombie films, (I have been more into other horror sub-genres) But from those few this is the best one. I recommend Dawn of the Dead for any one who can handle lots of gore.P.S. for a good (and long) version of the film (There are many versions of it) Check out this link:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba7is5M0POs",Dawn of the Dead
252,mr composer,Scary? No... Disturbing? Yes!,4,4 October 2001,"I checked out the definition of ""horror"" in the dictionary recently, and I noticed that the American Heritage lists 5 definitions.  In the case of this movie, I don't believe the first definition (""an intense painful feeling of repugnance and fear"") completely applies.  Take out ""and fear"" and that definition applies.  Instead, for this film I prefer definition four: ""Something unpleasant, ugly, or disagreeable.""Before I continue, I thought that ""Night of the Living Dead"" was a good film.  I admit it's not great, but there's something campy and claustrophobic about it.  ""Dawn of the Dead"" has an overall interesting concept, and neat smaller ideas within.  But there are a couple of things that bothered me about this film.1. It is not scary.  The flesh-eating zombies are indeed disgusting, comical, but not scary.  Only two things in a film can cause a scare.  The first is by way of the jolt or shock, where something unexpected just suddenly happens.  The second way is through sustained tension where you absolutely dread what is going to happen as you see it unfold in front of you.  I experienced neither of these things in this film.  There are bluntly no jolts.  The attempted sustained suspense fails because none of the characters are worth sympathizing over.  Good horror has terrible things happening to people whom you don't want to see it happen to.  Whether it be Romero's overly emphasized social message in this film of the inhumanity that comes within tragic times or what.. for some reason, I am never concerned with what happens to these people.2.  The graphic violence of this (and I'm referring to the Director's Cut version)is absurd, extravagant and unnecessary.  It almost seemed like the movie was an experiment for a special-effects artist to try out his latest toys.  A scene here and there showing the flesh-eaters at work in all of their gruesomeness could justify some of the content. By the time the movie ends (which I thought it never would), literally all hell has broken loose, and the gore is just completely uncalled for.  I thought I'd never see a movie that rivals the 80's version of ""The Fly"" as the goriest movie ever made, but this definitely does, and maybe even tops it.The whole movie is not completely atrocious.  The aforementioned social message, and the totalitarian society built by 4 people in a mall work really well in this film.  For that, I gave it a 4, but I couldn't rate it any higher.Final thoughts:  Another reviewer has already noted that this is more of an extremely black comedy than horror.  I would have to agree.  This is probably a movie worth taking a look at once.. if you have the stomach for it.  But unlike most users of this site, I can not rank it anywhere near my Top 50 for best horror films.",Dawn of the Dead
253,KnightLander,When there's no more room in hell ...,8,20 June 2005,"What to say about Dawn of the Dead? This sequel to Night of the Living Dead is probably the most famous horror film ever made. The second in George Romero's zombie trilogy, Dawn of the Dead became an instant cult classic - and it did so for a reason.Set directly after Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead begins with Francine and Stephen taking off in a helicopter to escape the worldwide panic, along with two S.W.A.T. team members. Soon, however, they discover they don't have enough fuel to take them much of anyplace. They land the chopper on the roof of a New England shopping mall. Looking inside, they discover the mall has everything they need to survive. Only one problem: it has everything the zombies need, too.Dawn of the Dead is a horror legend. There is over 250 different versions of the film from every continent. It is also known as ""Dawn of the Living Dead"" and released in many parts of the world as ""Zombi"". But it's really no wonder the film was such a hit: it's one of the only ""smart"" horror films you'll ever watch.George Romero is obviously a horror genius. He has created a trilogy of eerily realistic masterpieces, and Dawn of the Dead is the greatest of those films. It isn't particularly scary; it relies more on suspense for that effect. It is very gory (the zombie gut-eating scene will make even those with a strong stomach cringe). It is also extremely entertaining and completely absorbing.The zombie effects are very good, created by Tom Savini. This and its prequel helped to revolutionize not only the zombie genre but the horror genre itself. The zombies are especially good towards the end.There is also a classic score by Goblin. This helps add to the suspense, but while creating a certain mood for the film. It has a very creepy sound to it.The direction is terrific. I especially love the helicopter sequence in which the top of the zombie's head is slowly sliced to pieces from the helicopter blade! What else to say? If you haven't seen Dawn of the Dead and are a horror fan, you deserve to have those wretches fiends feast upon your intestines! You can not even begin to call yourself a horror watcher until you have seen this masterpiece, an epic of horrific proportions.""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.""",Dawn of the Dead
254,coy_dog0,No redeeming value...,2,25 August 2004,"This film has no redeeming value, other than (maybe) the enjoyment of the cast seeing themselves in a big budget home movie. Besides the cast, I can't understand anyone else forcing themselves to sit through this (I got 1:20 in before I shut it off). The reasons for the cult around this film and its follow-up (Day of...) are one of the great mysteries of film fandom. Please, don't dare tread near this movie. Make your own cheap horror flick in your backyard.  At least the zombies with green make-up and bad acting would be your friends, making it easier for you to laugh at them. 2/10",Dawn of the Dead

That's what this is. One of the best Zombie movies ever, certainly the best in the george romero zombies series.  To call this a horror movie is to barely touch the surface. This is so much more than a horror movie.  Infact, very few of George Romero's films are nothing but pure horror movies.  Though this movie is a bit on the long side you will not loose interest as happens in most long movies.  The acting was done very well by all characters.  When George wanted to do a gun fight sequence, he did an excellent one, when he wanted to do a Zombie butchering scene, he did an excellent one, when he wanted to do a dramatic scene, he did an excellent one.  That is what makes this movie so good, there was nothing mediocre about it.  It was all done very smoothly and the gore effects aren't bad at all even compared to our times.  There is a good amount of humor thrown in which adds to the charisma of this movie. Basically, if you haven't seen this movie, you should see it.

256,Tubular_Bell,One of the greatest comedies I've ever seen.,10,21 February 2007,"And I don't mean this derogatorily, as you can gather from my rating. I mean this as in ""really"". It might be a simple ""generation clash"" with the 70's, considering the levels that the horror genre has achieved with hateful garbage like Saw III hitting our screens. The movie is downright preposterous and hilarious in a number of ways, from the way the hordes of grey zombies wander around the mall to the sound of cheesy muzak, right down to the plot, in which the protagonists settle themselves in a materialistic utopia while - possibly - the entire world is heading straight into complete chaos. The overly graphic scenes (which are NOT stuffed into the entire feature the way stuff like the aforementioned Saw III did) are more repulsive than scary, and the zombies, like was once mentioned in the movie, are us.The word of the day here is absurdity, both in the execution of it with the special effects and bright glowing blood, and in the plot itself, which is pretty much believable. After all, if you're chasing for a depiction of a world catastrophe, you can get yourself ridiculously serious movies like The Day After Tomorrow, or you can get yourself the seriously ridiculous Dawn of the Dead, which is entertaining, funny and intense. If the movie seems obnoxious or dumb to you, well, you're in the right path.Though, of course, you can't just chuckle along with the movie as a campy B (or C?) movie. If this was really as fluffy as it might seem, it wouldn't have become so influential, famous and powerful, having made on a very tight budget. Dawn of the Dead is an artistic masterpiece, simple as that. It's a classic, and a nice cold water bucket for those who wonder what is the real inspiration for the whole Resident Evil thing - Boo! Spooky? Well, this is as spooky as a PlayStation video-game, but much more delightful. Watch it today, don't wait until tomorrow.",Dawn of the Dead
257,MovieManiacX,The Best Horror Movie Ever Made,10,18 January 2005,"What can I say about Dawn of the Dead that hasn't already been said? While watching the abysmal House of the Dead, a character mentions 'The Unholy Trilogy'. Intrigued, I hunted down a copy of Dawn of the Dead at my local video store. What I watched changed me forever...seriously.This movie cleverly balances comedy and horror, while delivering a great satire on consumer America. The characters are wonderful, the special effects are top notch, and the story is over-the-top, but the whole film is and that only adds to this gruesome, fun-filled horror-fest.Right from the beginning, the characters captivated me. They're extremely well-developed and you actually care about them. You feel for them as they try to desperately survive this horrific nightmare. Peter is my favorite. He's strong, sensible, level-headed, smart, and caring. Ken Foree is absolutely spectacular as Peter and I can't think of anyone who could've played him better. Scott Reiniger is good as Roger, but is a tad annoying. David Emge as Stephen tends to always mess things up and can be rather stubborn, but he grows on you as the movie goes on. Gaylen Ross as Fran is good. She goes from scared and frightened to strong-willed and courageous. The zombies themselves you start to like and make the film 10 times more enjoyable. They're responsible for most of the laughs, but are also violently gruesome when they tear you apart and eat your intestines while you're still alive.That brings me to the gore. While not as spectacular as Day of the Dead, it still shocked the heck out of me. Chunky zombie bites, heads blown apart (literally), the top of a head chopped off by spinning helicopter blades (my favorite), messy headshots, a decapitation, and people ripped apart and eaten, this baby is likely to make you sick. But I enjoyed it!!!! I also have to mention the music. This is the cheesiest music you will ever hear, but it works perfectly here. I loved the music as the credits are rolling the most. I whistle it all the time.So how did this movie change me? Well, it introduced me to zombies, which I find particularly fascinating. I absolutely love gore now, and it doesn't sicken me like it used to. Dawn of the Dead shows you how horror movies should be made.The Bottom Line:Whether you're just looking for gore or you want to see one of the best horror movies ever, look no further then Dawn of the Dead.",Dawn of the Dead

Yes, I stand fully behind the idea that, even though there are acres of zombies wandering about, it's more an action film than a horror. There're just too many tussles, shoot outs, gags, and near-misses for it to be anything else.Which is fine: it's certainly a more interesting action film than the entire Indiana Jones series combined. I would have given it a nine except for one thing: the biker gang. Sure, it was nice to see Tom Savini getting a well-deserved appearance, but really, that gang just completely ruins the segment that they are in, but luckily, Romero gets it back together at the last minute, and overcomes his lapse in judgement.You probably know the basic story: four people from varying backgrounds get stranded in a mall, and survive for a while.",Dawn of the Dead

260,Evil_Magus,"Uneven, Dated and Disappointing, but still Classic.",7,30 June 2006,"It must first be said in this review of Dawn of the Dead (1978), that I've been given plenty of time to build it up in my mind. I tried, unsuccessfully, to get a copy after my brother told me that I ""had"" to see it. I found out, though, that the IFC (Independent Film Channel) was having a Pulp Month in June, where they would show classic independent pulp movies. Dawn of the Dead was on their schedule but, wouldn't you know it, was going to be shown only on the 30th. I had the entire month to wait and build it up in my mind. Needless to say, I built it up quite a bit. That being said, it's quite natural that the film disappointed my built-up expectations of it.The film is uneven in several regards. In pace, it goes from moments of heightened action to moments of none joltingly, almost sporadically. When it doesn't change pace, it drags. From the dramatic scenes to the action scenes, this film moves very slowly. It stretches each scene out more than it should, and can become quite repetitive as a result. It could have benefited from condensing most scenes into more manageable ones.The soundtrack is what makes this film especially dated. It's eerie and typically 70's-esque synthesized background music sometimes help to build tension, but are most often entirely inappropriate for the scene. Typically some odd whimsical tune will be playing in moments of terror or action, which detracts from the scene rather than adding to it.The scene where the Raiders attack comes off at times as utterly ridiculous. After being on the road raiding whatever you can in a world where the dead devour the living, why would you bother burdening yourself with money and jewelry? You steal from everybody you come across, so who would you sell them to? The way that they battled the zombies, for the first half of that scene, was utterly laughable, and took away from the seriousness of the threat that they perpetuated for the previous two hours. It demeaned their credibility as antagonists (both the zombies and the raiders). This scene could have made the movie an undisputed classic, equal, even, to Night of the Living Dead. But it's treated so childishly for so long, that even the latter half of it can only subsidize so much.All of that being said, the film was incredible. The characters were extremely well cast, and played their parts perfectly. The script was impeccably written, and cunningly satirical, yet without turning the film into comedic horror. There were several ingenious moments criticizing American consumerism, such that it reminded me of Stephen King's novel Needful Things (pay no attention to the movie of the same name). The small cast worked especially well for the film, making each life mean all the more, and I rather liked the idea of the helicopter. Especially in the beginning, it was an ingenious way to show the carnage of the world below.Overall, this is a great film, and a must see for fans of the horror genre, especially fans of Romero or zombie movies. Even more critical movie-goers can appreciate the wit and intelligence of the script. However, this movie lacks the same pervasive atmosphere of the original Night of the Living Dead. Mostly I would attribute this to that horridly-chosen background music, and part with the more dated make-up choices for the zombies (blue faces). I doubt, however, that a typical mainstream audience of young movie-goers would, on the average, greatly enjoy this movie.",Dawn of the Dead

Its just a great horror!,8,27 October 2010,"A large number of reviews seek to find some deeper meaning and hidden message in this film which is utter nonsense. Take any film, regardless of subject and content and you can conjure up a multitude of meanings and messages. Every single image and line of dialogue in any movie can be made to mean anything the po faced thinky brain wants it to. The choice of mall for the majority of the filming and stoyline was based on financial restraints as the director stated him self. There's no social commentary here about the wests addiction to materialism, racism, abortion, religion and so on. It simply made a perfect location where the filming could be done overnight and there were enough avenues for plot lines to be had in a large mall. IF there is indeed a message its about Americans and Malls. Perhaps at a push I could agree there is a slight message here, but its not overtly political. The rise of the Mall just happened to occur in the 1970's and a little research shows that there were a lot of people up in arms about them so its perhaps just a little bit of social commentary of the time period.This movie is about how a small band of survivors hole up in a mall to survive the walking dead who feast on live human flesh. If one gets you and take a chunk out of you then you to will become a Zonbie. Best to avoid them then.

First he brought us films like ""Night Of The Living Dead"" (1968) ""There's Always Vanilla"" (1972) ""The Crazies"" (1973). Now he brings us Dawn Of The Dead (1978). I saw this film when I was in 10th or 11th Grade I rented the VHS at a local rental store. of course it was in Pan & Scan Full Screen. It scared the hell out of me I was alone when I saw it I was so scared I can't describe it. As u already know how Zombie Films were my main fear when I was young. The gore effects & Zombie Make-Up are top notch for the time Tom Savini is a master & this is one of his best. I think the Zombie Make-Up could of been better most of the zombies just had pale gray faces. Some had rotted parts & scars. There should have been more latex appliances used like in Day Of The Dead (1985). The gore is highly effective & very intense. I look at it today & still wonder how Savini pulled it off. Anyway 4 survivors take refuge in Monroeville Mall. To try to survive their hiding upstairs & hoping the zombies don't catch on. Then the bikers show up & let all of the ones outside in & there is a lot of trouble on everyone's hands. This is when the gore really starts a lot of the bikers getting ripped apart & eaten by the zombies. My favorite parts are when the one guy gets his arm ripped off. Also when the other biker gets his stomach ripped open. Tom Saving also did a lot of the stunts & played the lead Biker in the film. This is the film that made him big a household name. While making this film he was just Tom the Make-Up Man. Now he is the Tom Savini one of the Master Special Make-Up Effects Artists. The movie is awesome. In Oct 2006 I got The Ultimate Edition 4 Disc DVD Set. I watched all the stuff except The Extended Version, which is actually to, fans the Director's Cut. The European Version was good. It doesn't have a lot of that goofy stuff that funny Mall Music & the Escalator scenes. Which make the film sorta Campy & with a sense of humor. I didn't get that when I saw it though on VHS when it scared me. Anyway now I do & I appreciate that version but The European & Director's Cut are much better. I haven't watched the Director's Cut yet in Widescreen I have seen it in Pan & Scan though as I have The Anchor Bay VHS Release of it. Disc 4 is full of cool stuff 2 Documentaries about the making one from the 70's made while filming the movie & the other a recent documentary. Then it has a Tour of Monroeville Mall with Star Ken Foree & Nurse Zombie Sharon Ceccatti also the sweater escalator Zombie played by Clayton Hill. Followed by loads of fans. Also has some old 8mm Home Film Footage made during filming. With Audio Commentary by a fan. Good stuff Each Movie is in the original 1.85:1 Widescreen Aspect Ratio & includes Trailers, T.V. Spots. Radio Spots & Photo Galleries. Except The Extended Version (Director's Cut) dosen't have any Trailers, T.V. Spots or Radio Spots. It Does have a Monroeville Commercial as well as a Photo Gallery also all 3 Films have Audio Commentaries. Which are always good & informing to listen to with the movie. Monsterbash 2007 is coming Tom Savini is gonna be there again I am getting his autograph on my Ultimate Edition. What else can I say awesome film 8 out of 10!",Dawn of the Dead
266,beatnick49,"Fun, strait to the point and better than the remake, Dawn of the Dead 1978 is the original and the best",9,25 September 2006,"This is a good movie that doesn't pull any punches, in terms of it's message and it's visuals. It is also just good fun.The message of this movie is clear. That Western society in the late 1970s has fallen victim to consumerism. We are stuck with it, we don't really like it, but at the same time we want it, we like it, we live in it and we are addicted to it. So much is it apart of us that the we insticively come back to it. It is probably no acciddent that the zombies resemble shopping dummies are repeatedly shown. Like dummies and zombies we are practically lifeless and attracted to and apart of the shopping mall.The movie is also really good fun. I just had to laugh at some the scenes in this; a car driving around a shopping mall looks so comical and the zombie getting it's head sliced off by the rotor was funny as well. There were plenty of other good scenes that had me laughing. As well as the funny scenes there are plenty of scenes of creative violence in which no punches are pulled either; the zombie copping the rotor in the head, a truck sending a zombie flying, a head reduced to pieces of meat, chunks of flesh ripped out by the teeth before our eyes, a machete strait through the face, a fountain becoming a zombie pit. All in you face. Even so there are moments of reprieve and it is not a nasty free for all like the nasty, over the top and over rated garbage heap that is Sin City (Sin S*** House) (the only sin there was the making of the film).The music is also good. Goblin create an attractive, eerie and fitting tune. I wish I could find the soundtrack to the original film.And it is better than the remake. It is just so much fun, you can sympathise with the characters, and it much more entertaining. I remember beleiving I'd had more fun with the original than the remake. With Dawn of the Dead 1978, ""The original and the best"" is a very fitting title.Fun, strait to the point and better than the remake, Dawn of the Dead 1978 is a good entertainment.",Dawn of the Dead
267,simon-81093,Best zombie film ever!,10,9 July 2020,"I saw this in the cinema as a teenager when it was released in the UK during the early 1980's and it blew me away. It had everything horror fan could want - good story, suspense, gore, guns and more guns. I hadn't seen anything like it before and it's made a lasting impression. I always preferred the European release with the soundtrack by Goblin. Yes, inevitably it's somewhat dated but watch the HD restored version and you won't be disappointed. Remember this was long before CGI and Tom Savini did an excellent job. Romero's slow moving zombies make it more menacing and creepy - it also means you have a fighting chance. The modern fast zombies make it too unfair! Thank you George Romero and RIP.",Dawn of the Dead

The effects for 1978 awesome, I love the makeup on the zombies and the way they look.And the death scenes there killer. I just can't decide whats a better zombie movie this or Dead Alive (Or brain dead in some country's) I would have to give it too Dawn of the Dead by a small margin, It has a better plot, and a cooler concept (being stuck in a shopping mall and making it your home is a cool idea. I loved the redneck's shooting zombies and drinking beer, that was great. One of my fav horror's ever A perfect 10/10",Dawn of the Dead
269,awerling,Unpopular opinion: not as good as the first film,6,12 June 2011,"Funny, suspenseful, overlong, self-indulgent, campy, nauseating, dull, insightful, and not as good as Night of the Living Dead. I guess I could get analytical on this and try to explain all these things, but for me they are all true, so it gets a balanced six-star rating. You'll have your own opinion. One thing: yep, malls in real life kinda are like zombie-land. The danger in going much deeper into sociological analysis is that the visual impact, and the almost surreal crazy-making soundtrack do a better job of making the point. It's a nihilistic film in some ways. Unlike in something like Truman Show, wherein there is a way out of zombie-hood, these characters just set up a play-land for themselves (who wouldn't?) and run away with nowhere else to really go. We're left, in the end, knowing that we either need to sell our souls to consumerism, or get slaughtered by it. If that's too depressing, we get some guts and stereotyped biker dudes to distract us. But I'm probably being a bit too hard. It's fun (should be shorter), but in my opinion, much overrated.",Dawn of the Dead
270,Bub_the_zombie,An Icon in horror entertainment,10,21 June 2002,"...when there's no more room in hell...the dead will walk the Earth.Never in horror cinematic history has a tagline made me chill even before watching the film. I can remember at the tender age of five--when vhs was the ""new big thing"" and the complete and utter bliss of consumerism was wild and rampid and everything seemed like a fantasy. I slowly walked into this small independant video store with only one objective--and that was to give my imagination what it wanted--brainfood. Horror has always been a part of my life...even in my early years. I am now a grown man in his early twenties with still have the same affliction for that fantasy world as I had as a kid. George Romero's Dawn of the Dead, in my own humble hearted opinion has literaly shaped my life and my beliefs and my sense of imagination in general, whether it be in writing short stories or creating an idea from a morsel of his masterwork. As a child I didn't (nor would any child) grasp what what Romero was saying right there on the silver screen in technicolor for everyone to see. I didn't realize at the age of five that the film in general was nothing but a mere depiction of us in all our consumer lust with greed in our eyes and with shopping carts in hand ready to capture some new gadget. It is a scenerio of us slowly sliding into that inescapable pit of dept and materialism and everything that accompanies it. I thought it was amazing how when Roger (one of my all time favorite characters) was bitten, Peter pushed him around in a cart, just like he would have pushed his newly boughten goods he paid his hard earned money for.  Roger WAS ""the goods""...used up and forgotten as some toy when it performs less perfectly or not how one would like it to. Hell, go buy another one! Another scene that really hits home is when Roger is in the makeshift hospital drained and stoned on repeated shots of morphine...""We whipped 'em and we got it all!.."" Roger exclaims from his lips in victory, but little did he know that under his drug induced state was the truth...the truth that soon he would no longer live and breath and soon be useles--just like a heroine addict on the street..blinded by the drug and fueled by the money he needed for other things. This film is no average horror film. It goes deeper than that. It is what some people will call ..""a thinking man's horror film.""While Dawn of the Dead is not without its flaws, the shere determination and storyline overcomes the mistakes and makes way for one of the best experiences one could have in front of a television set. For those of you who haven't seen it...please do! And for those who have let's take our hats off to Romero for even casting this marvelous idea into his great mind..Thanx George!",Dawn of the Dead
271,enjoyuk,All time Classic,9,18 October 1999,"I just rediscovered this gem on DVD (UK Directors cut), I thought that Dawn of the Dead would look really dated after all these years, but I was really shocked at how well it has stood the test of time.  I think I enjoyed this more in '99 than I did watching it for the first time in the 80's. George Romero really went all out on this one.  The cast are brilliant, even though there is not one recognisable actor in it.  The humour is great and not piled on too thick, unlike most modern day horror films.  I especially liked the part when the guy at the helicopter pad is asking everyone for a cigarette and nobody claims to have one, and then as soon as the helicopter is in the air everybody inside lights up.  The special effects are really gruesome and Tom Savini really proves he is a master of his profession.  The DVD version I viewed had a audio commentary by Mr. Savini and an uncredited colleague, it was actually quite entertaining as it played out like an episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"".   The only downside to rediscovering this classic was wanting to see more, so I went and rented the dreadful ""Day of the Dead"" straight afterwards.!  Well George, two great zombie flicks out of three isnt too bad.",Dawn of the Dead
272,yogsottoth,Scariest Movie Ever!!,10,10 December 2004,"When I saw this movie I was about 12 and I was scared to death!! I couldn't sleep for days without my dad keeping watch, I couldn't go to the malls for a long time and it took me a month to go back to my normal life and realize there were no zombies in the world :) Now, when I look back I can understand that I was obviously depressed. Depressed at 12! Nobody except Romero can do that! I could watch it again only 1 year ago and it was still scary.It isn't the first zombie movie ever made but it's the first zombie movie that set the rules for the genre, and it was the best so far back then. To create something so scary and cool with such a low budget... Now that's success.An incredible script, lovely cheesy acting (""Perfect baby, perfect.""), the amazing 70's atmosphere, original directing, cleverly placed social message, dark humour, the most thrilling OSD ever made (Goblin), beyond its time make-up effects and of course... the Buddhist Zombie! (God, the guy still gives me the creeps.) These are a couple of the many elements that make this movie a horror masterpiece.Other two members of the Dead trilogy are incredible, very scary and thrilling as well.So, if you want to have a classic horror night, why not go with the trilogy? You won't regret it.",Dawn of the Dead
273,ChoiceCuts,Not what I had expected.,9,31 January 2004,"When I bought this I didn't expect anything else than a funny and gory flick that I could watch anytime I don't have anything better to do.Well I was proven wrong. This movie rocks.I have never considered zombies to be scary. But somehow Romero made it work. He has created some really suspenseful scenes. Also, besides being scary at times Romero has succeeded in making it funny and smart. In many ways this movie works like a satire, and it does it well, it's also filled with black humour wich gives the movie an extra dimension. So I was mighty surprised and impressed.One thing that didn't surprise me one the other was that the movie contained much gore and blood, but hey, that was expected. Pretty odd though that I sometimes thought that the movie felt so good in different departs that the gore even wasn't necessary.This is by far the best Zombie film I've seen. It's way better than Lucio Fulci's lame ""Zombie flesheaters"". It also surpasses the good-but-not-truly-great ""Night of the living dead"" and this trilogy's third part, the too-much-talk-too-little-rock ""Day of the dead"".So go and rent it now. If you're phobic to blood and gut's, watch it anyway. It's worth it.9/10",Dawn of the Dead
274,carry-on-man,The best Zombie movie hands down,10,8 April 2018,"Having been impressed with this movie since first seeing it in the early eighties on video I feel compelled to write a review of the reviews on IMDB, it deservedly gets a high score, with 10 out of 10 user reviews one after the other, until you hit the spate of 1 out of 10 reviews. Who are these people? Surely they're not movie fans, the big problem with the internet is that you see everybody's opinion, including those of blithering idiots. Some people are even complaining about the zombies not running about after people! I blame this modern idea of zombies on the DOTD remake and 28 Days Later etc. They aren't zombie films, dead people running about whilst they slowly decompose is just stupid. The fear is in that even though they only shuffle about they are so vast in number that there is no escape no matter where you run, they only have that burst of speed when they're close to the victim in true zombie films. The idea is that you can escape for a while and try to avoid them, but eventually they close in and get you. The exciting parts of this movie work because they don't move fast, allowing the protagonists to do things that fill the film with interesting possibilities, like what would it be like to live in a shopping mall with no customers and nobody charging you for anything? It's a black comedy about consumerism and it wouldn't work if all those zombies ran around like Olympic athletes, making for quick deaths and desperate hiding as seen in the remake, it took the fun out of it.",Dawn of the Dead
275,ibanez747,A Classic That's Way Too Long,8,17 February 2005,"This movie is a classic. Romero's writing, special effects (Tom Savini), and direction were excellent. The reason why I give it an 8 is because of two things: 1. Movie is too long 2. Zombies are clownish buffoons.I disagree with some reviewers in that nothing could have been cut out of the movie. I think quite a few things could have. How about the 35 minutes playing tennis and having dinner? I understand this compromises a lot of Romero's intended social commentary of the day, but interlacing a whole bunch of ideas into a zombie flick, of all things, was not a good idea. Even for those who emphasize the socio-political aspects of this movie cannot deny its length. Because anyone who has seen it, probably got up a couple times to take a break (food, bathroom, breather).For the most part I enjoyed the movie. It's placement in the history of horror films cannot be denied. It laid down a foundation, along with its predecessor Night of the Living Dead, of a genre of movies. For that I give it an 8.I actually enjoyed the remake better, which condensed and modernized the story. It was actually scary. Zombies acted like ravenous predators and were unrelenting, exactly what they are supposed to be.I would suggest people to see it at least once.",Dawn of the Dead
276,greenflea2,Good,8,14 January 2007,"This is a good zombie movie, of course there is many flaws and its rather outdated as well. I just wonder how the zombies overrun the world, were the military, police and armed civilians seem to be doing a excellent job in blowing zombies away. The movie shows scenes of the army along with armed civilians, none showning any alarm or fear, destroying every zombie at sight. Meaning it be impossible for zombies to take on the world with a response like this. Even in the city, the military and the police are able halt the zombies, like does not seem to be any large packs of zombies roaming loose. Again, the army and the police should be able to clean up against the zombies. It makes me wonder, how these zombies could win the world.There is a scene showing a group of police deserting, one police officer seems such a imbecile, obviously just a low paiding bit acter wearing a police uniform.The story around the shopping mall is excellent, and how the survivors are able to defend themselves and live in such conditions. The idea of the biker gang is great, as there would be such survivors roaming around, picking off shopping centres. Again, the bikers can take on hundreds of zombies with ease, just something like under 20 of them can defeat hundreds of zombies, again makes it any wonder, how the zombies could win the world in the first place. I do feel the ending is far better, than the ending of the 2004 Dawn of the dead.",Dawn of the Dead
277,ZMBKLR,One of the Greatest Modern Horror Films Ever!,9,17 March 2002,"Funny that I refered to this as a Horror film, when I really consider it a Science Fiction, but ce la vie. It's a great film and I can hardly wait for the ultimate DVD to come out so I can have it! Quite simply this film is relentless. The dead cannot be bargained with, cannot be dealt with, they can only be killed or you the living become lunch. Dawn is the epitome of the Zombie film. The only bad thing it did was influence a bunch of lame Italian and other filmmakers to make crummy, worthless zombie films and now this one is being remade. HELLO! Stop while there is still time! There is no NEED to remake this film, it's as perfect as it's ever going to be. Period. An adventure/horror tale about four people trying to survive the collapse of civilization, I don't buy Siskel and Eberts whole Zombies are the ultimate consumers crap.

278,ricardovs27,Zombie Ambition,9,20 January 2008,"No matter what everyone out there says, this flick is ""THE"" zombie movie of all time, period. Pappa Romero is at his peak as a writer/director, delivering engaging character development (withdelighted nods to underrated Ken Foree, simply chewing the scenery as the true hero of the proceedings), gruesome and splattering violence(some shots are really disgusting), hard-hitting criticism at the society (which are unfortunately still valid) and, to end the whole thing, a touching love story!!!! Damn, is this fella good or what? The quite long running time and slow pace can be harmful to most viewers,specially those not accustomed to use their brains while watching a movie. The plot unfolds step by step, with more than occasional scenes of the main characters doing jack-nothing, like gathering food or testing clothes. But it has a purpose, I assure you guys. Because all of it is important to hint what is between the lines. The social commentary beneath the exploding heads and guts pushes the experience to another level. Some shots of the mall are really disturbing in their simplicity, creating an uneasy and insanity-inducing atmosphere throughout the whole thing. The special effects and make-up are creative and effective, aiding the tension and fear into an almost unbearable high. The relentlessness of the monsters (both human and zombies) is bone-wrecking, with many cool and violent action sequences to balance it all. Violent, smart, tense and then some! ""Dawn of the Dead"" is a must-see for all film fans, even those who can't stand the genre; it excels in expert film-making and intelligence.",Dawn of the Dead
279,Ace_of_Sevens,A Worthy Sophomore Effort,8,30 May 2006,"I really loved Night of the Living Dead. It's one of my all-time favorite horror movies. Despite this, I just now got around to watching this sequel, even though it came out a couple years before I was born. I watched the US theatrical version for this review.The movie isn't quite as good as its near-perfect predecessor, despite clearly having some money (though not a bunch) to work with this time. The main problem is that it can be rather heavy-handed. Yes, we get that consumer culture makes us all into zombies. You don't need to spell it out for us every few minutes.Unlike today's dead-teenager flicks (and the remake of Dawn of the Dead) with their plethora of expendables to up the kill-count, this movie gets it right. We have four main characters and we get to know them all, so when someone dies, it matters. It's pretty tight POV, like we're living in the mall with everyone and we get into everyone's life. It's alternately tense and funny.Despite hitting you in the face with its themes half a dozen times, the movie really works, partially because it's still socially relevant (and there are some more subtle parts, too) and partially because of the well-developed characters. I recommend it.",Dawn of the Dead
280,yakikorosu,This is a masterpiece.... why?,2,5 March 2005,"I'd heard a lot about how this movie was a horror classic, so I went ahead and bought it when I saw it on sale cheap. All I can say is ""Huh?"" On the upside, there is indeed some social commentary, broaching topics such as racism, consumerism and the fact that the bikers in the end seem a lot more evil than the zombies. But that's all there is in this movie, and the rest of it, quite frankly, is awful.1) The movie is not at all scary. The zombies look idiotic; I don't mind low budget but smearing grayish paste all over someone's face (they didn't even bother with the rest of their body) is the kind of makeup job I expect in a high school play. The zombies never seem at all threatening, as they move at the speed of a snail and are totally uncoordinated. The only way I can see them killing ANYONE is if you're an idiot who runs into a dead-end room and just stands there waiting for a whole horde to come to you.2) The movie fails to deliver ANY kind of atmosphere. Aside from a few bare bones newscasts on the fate of various parts of the US, most of the movie takes place in a brightly lit mall, where the characters don't feel at all in danger and a 'the world is ending' feel is totally nonexistent. There's no appreciable action element either; I think pro wrestling looks more realistic than this. And why the hell do the characters keep wasting their time shooting zombies in the chest when it's been clearly established that only head shots kill them? 3) The acting is very, very bad. The dialogue is hackneyed and weak, and the character development is forced and mostly just made me roll my eyes a lot, thinking ""They expect me to buy THIS?"" The social commentary in this movie could be made with a half-hour documentary, or better yet, a 6-page paper for a high school sociology class, and I would have been saved $10 and 2 hours of my time. I will not forgive it.",Dawn of the Dead

Don't think of this just as a ""Zombie flick""...it's one of the most entertaining movies ever made in any genre.  Scares, laughs, thrills, action, drama, basically everything you could want in a movie (except romance or sex, I suppose).  The film sucks you in right from the start and never lets up. Some have said it is dated, but I disagree; given the current fear of bio/chem attack and WWIII, this movie -- with the zombies' ability to contaminate others, taking over an everyday location such as a shopping mall, and people barricading themselves inside -- is VERY timely.",Dawn of the Dead
282,Simmonz,A Great Horror Movie for almost Anyone,9,6 July 2006,"I had been waiting to see the original Dawn of the Dead for a long time now, and I finally rented it last night. It was awesome. You'll have to forgive me if I reference the remake of Dawn of the Dead often in this review, I saw it first so I was basing my expectations off of that. The original had more gore (which surprised me), a more developed story and characters, and had a slightly better payoff at the end. This is not to knock the remake, which I still love, but to show you how good the original was. It has everything a horror fan could love, lots of monsters ( in this case zombies), lots of gore, and a little bit of comedy thrown in. What I liked about Dawn of the Dead was it conveyed to me what being trapped in the mall was doing to the characters, it wasn't just an intermission to the next action scene. I liked how it built up how they got to the mall, what they did to the mall, it took time to set things up which is rare for most horror movies. Also, maybe it's because I rented the remastered version, but it didn't look or feel to be 28 years old. So just a quick recap of why I loved Dawn of the Dead, a lot of gore, a wonderfully crafted story, and a good set of actors/actresses. I didn't find it scary or creepy, but still enjoyed it nonetheless. I am not giving it perfect because in that story I was talking about earlier I did find it dragged a bit, I think a few minutes could of been shaved off here and there. I recommend to any horror fan who hasn't seen it, and to anyone who wants to see a good movie, and can stand to see gore. I give it 9/10.",Dawn of the Dead
283,SteveDonnachie20022001,A good movie,8,29 May 2005,Dawn of the dead will go down as one of the best horror movies ever. This movie unlike other horror movies had a feeling of weirdness to it. Thats what made it so good. The effects could have been better but what do you expect from a movie from a different time in which the horror movies didn't have the fancy effects you see today in horror movies. This movie is a bit different then the remake of 2004. This movie was more story and less violence. I kind of thought the main characters were a little corny at times and seemed like they wern't acting the right way during a certain situation.I guess the best scene I liked was the truck scene where Roger and Peter are trying to block of the doors to the mall with trucks. And from there everything went wrong. I won't ruin it by telling ya what happened.But if you get a chance I recommend picking this one up.,Dawn of the Dead

Just the title alone makes me jump up and down like a little kid excited about opening presents.  It's been about 4 years since I first viewed this classic.  And ever since, I've seen it about 30 times.  I'm glad it finally got a chance to play on HBO and Cinemax, due to a ton of fan mail, but they cut out about 15 minutes of footage.  There is not a single bad thing about this.  Every little aspect about it is excellent.  I can recite the dialogue, hum the theme song all the time, and always pretend I'm in a mall battling zombies.  It's inspired several video games, incl. Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Resident Evil 1 & 2, had its own board game, newsletter, and it even broke into the top 15 films of 1978!  Wow!  The 20th anniversary DVD will be out soon, so I'll be viewing that, although I've already seen four different versions of the film.  Oh, and the sequel, Day of the Dead, is almost as good, but not quite.  Dawn of the Dead is also unique for combining so many genres into one = horror-action-comedy -romance-martial-arts.

Thats a classic!  One of the previous commments said, that the effects were so bad, even for its time, well i beg to differ.  The effects were well done, very gory, though it did have its flaws.

Although, Night is a definite classic and stands above this and every other zombie film that has been made and ever will be made. It does so, in a different sense. This sequel is timeless, it will never be considered tame, because Romero spared no expense or mercy on the audience and unlike most directors he did it with class. Yes, no blood was spilt, just to spill more blood. It was always done with class and was never too over the top. I've seen the remake and even though, I enjoyed that too, it's a period film.Set in the present, this isn't. It also doesn't operate as a sequel, no mention of the original characters or references are made and is really a stand alone film. Romero has stated that although in the time line this takes place after Night, he doesn't consider it a real sequel. Romero also manages to mix humor with his horror(although, Dario Argento's European cut eliminates most of the humor)and still delivers a stellar film. So anyone reading who hasn't seen it, get off the computer and buy this film(if you like zombie films, don't rent, pointless). Sit back and enjoy it.

287,pkourakos,One word...Masterpiece,10,15 April 2008,"Before I begin, allow me to say that I love zombies. As far as I'm concerned, George Romero is the Zombie Master. Others have tried to emulate his work, but almost all of them fail miserably.With that said, here's my review. I had heard so much about this movie that it almost became legendary in my eyes. I saw the remake, which I loved even though it's got fast zombies, but I wanted to see the original.I caught the last 40 minutes of this on Encore one day and wondered why it was held in such a high regard. It seemed very dated and way too campy. Seeing this made me want to see it from the beginning even more. A couple of years later I finally bought this. After watching it i was kicking myself for not buying it sooner.There are lots of movies that people call ""Masterpieces."" I've seen some of these yet NOTHING I have ever seen is in the same league as this movie. After watching this I finally understand the true meaning of the word ""Masterpiece."" Because it's Romero, the gore is top notch. You're not gonna get too much better if he's directing a movie. It also helps that Tom Savini did all of the effects. I think the only person who could do a better job than Savini is Rick baker, but that's for another post.The story is incredibly sad and beautifully portrayed. The atmosphere pulls you into a world where the Zombie Apocalypse has come to fruition. Yes, the acting is cheesy at times and there are campy moments. The cheese I'll attribute to the seventies. The camp is there because the survivors are trying to make the best of things in a world where everything will only get worse.I fell in love with this movie after only one viewing. I like to say that NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is my favorite zombie movie, but I'm not so sure that I can say that anymore. I also can't say that I like DAWN better than NIGHT. Let's just say that it's excruciatingly close and I don't want to compare the two.This movie is VERY highly recommended.",Dawn of the Dead
288,duanekimball,I can't think of one thing that was good,2,18 July 2011,"The ""plot"" is so bad that they don't explain how Zombies started or what the government is doing except for arguing...so I guess you on your own.The acting is..BAD. After a short while of their stupidity and bad acting, you want the main characters to die. You are left wondering how they survived this far in the first place.The makeup is pretty bad too. It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't use ""hot pink"" colored blood. This movie was obviously to showcase the makeup department and special effects..that's the only reason I didn't give it a 1.I like Zombie movies and this one was just painful to watch. I have no idea how it has garnered an 8 on IMDb. Just because it's really bad doesn't mean it deserves a high vote. They didn't mean for it to be bad.I think anyone who has seen a few zombie movies would also be annoyed at how bad this was written and why you wouldn't do 99% of the things these characters did to try and save themselves. They had no contingency plan at all.There are four main characters 1) Normal guy who for some reason turns into a lunatic 2) Normal guy who stays normal 3) Idiot guy who stays an idiot 4) Woman who smokes while pregnant...awesomeBesides #2, I was hoping to see the other three off'd within the first 30 minutes. There are scenes with roaming zombies for minutes at a time...ugh.Again, just because it was made by some famous comic-con people...doesn't make it worth watching.",Dawn of the Dead
289,lucky_dice_mgt,One of the most overrated horror films ever...,3,28 July 2008,"IMHO, Dawn of the Dead and Halloween are two of the most overrated horror films ever and ironically they were both 70s films.Dawn of the Dead does not have any "" scary "" moments in it as far as im concerned. The beginning of the film is interesting because it shows the pure chaos of the situation with the government and media in total dis-array . This film trys to blend humour and horror and never succeeds highly in either department { at least not in the way Return of the Living Dead was able to accomplish} . The special effects are far from gruesome { in fact, I think Night of the Living Dead had more impactive effects/ gore scenes} . I also found that the characters were rather bland, to the point that I didn't care what happened to them. I also think that having much of the film take place in a shopping mall, with zombies trying to ride escalators, etc, spoiled many of the possible horror elements.It is totally bizarre to me, that anyone could rate this film as the best zombie film of all time or the best horror film ever made. IMHO, Night of Living Dead is much better....better acting, script, originality, lighting, camera-work, effective gore, soundtrack, dialogue, etc. Ironically, neither Halloween or Dawn of the Dead would make my top 100 horror movie list . I think many people get caught up in rating this film so highly, because of the era it was made and screened and the meomories associated with that time period. Simliar to the nostalgia of liking a specific song from a certain era of music, even though when one gets older and listens to that same song, they can realize it may not have been a great song, but the meomories it evokes are still charming and meomorable.",Dawn of the Dead
290,Blitz-5,The epitome of Zombie flicks!,10,22 January 1999,"This is the first horror movie I ever really fell in love with. From the first frame and note we're brought into Romero's world of terror. A must have movie for any serious horror enthusiast. From 1 to 10, I rate this at 11.

291,jtk57,Zombie Horror at it's Best,10,31 March 2007,"""Dawn Of The Dead"" is an acknowledged high watermark of late 70's horror movies in general and of zombie cinema in particular. All but the most contrarian fan-boys agree that this may very well be George Romero's masterpiece, and I am inclined to agree. The atmosphere of Dread (with a capital ""D"") descends immediately as we are introduced to the main characters in two initial segments. An ultimately over-matched SWAT team invades an inner city building and comes face to face with the living dead, most memorably in the basement, where a veritable pig pen of corpses are coming to life. A TV station struggles to stay on the air as more and more news piles in reporting that the dead are rising up and devouring the living. Without reservation, I can say that the film makes me feel like I am right there, threatened with harm which is right outside the door. When the main characters escape in the helicopter, searching for somewhere to start over again and escape the zombie plague, I feel relief and hope right along with them. The synthesized music also is very atmospheric and lends its own air of menace. Apparently Romero is acknowledged as a top notch editor who was notorious for using his own hands, a knife, and a roll of movie tape to cut his films. Well, it works great because the editing is energetic and the pacing very well suited to each scene. The action and gore scenes are visually ""wonderful"" (read; putrid, gross, perfect) and intermittently humorous, while bearing the unmistakable stamp of the great Tom Savini. I would highly recommend reading about the background of the making of this movie, or watching the well regarded extras documentaries in the expanded DVD editions. The story of the dedicated personalities and circumstances behind the making of this awesome movie makes it all the more enjoyable to experience. This is one horror movie that delivers in every respect, fires on all cylinders, grabs and holds your attention, and is worthy of all the praise that has been heaped on it over the years. Belongs in every horror fan's library without a doubt.",Dawn of the Dead

293,Robin-97,The best sequel ever made!,10,7 September 1999,"Those who suggest that ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Godfather II"" is the greatest sequel of all time just have that opinion shrugged off by me. ""Dawn of the Dead"" is not a title that pops up that often when people bring up the subject of superior sequels (I was disappointed not to hear its name mentioned in the endless sequel discussions during ""Scream 2""), but it gets my vote as the film that best continues the story of and improves upon its predecessor. George Romero has given his ""Night of the Living Dead"" sequel a new backdrop and a whole new set of characters, but has maintained the central theme of his original, and uses his higher budget to further examine it to great effect. And he also creates one hell of a horror film while he's at it.The zombie epidemic has spread mightily since ""NOTLD"", and four characters, traffic reporter Steven (David Emge), his fiancee Fran (Gaylen Ross), and SWAT team members Roger (Scott Reiniger) and Peter (Ken Foree), decide to barricade themselves from the troubles of the outside world in an abandoned but fully functional shopping mall. Many will argue that ""Dawn of the Dead"" isn't as scary or intense as its predecessor, but that would be missing the point. While ""Night"" told a tight, minimalist, claustrophobic story that only took place over the course of one night, ""Dawn"" is practically a horror epic. The full-length director's cut runs 140 minutes, which is almost an unheard-of running time for a horror film. Romero wishes to show us how his characters develop and handle their situation over the course of many months. Two-thirds of the way through, after the characters have worked hard to successfully clear the mall of zombies and build up a perfect utopia for themselves, the living dead are forgotten about for an extended period of time as the film focuses on the intense boredom that develops within these people, who can't come to grips with their new trouble-free existence. It is almost a relief to them when a large biker gang stops by to loot the mall, and the climax is not so much about the threat the zombies provide, but about the threat the humans provide to each other.Using his shopping mall setting to sprinkle his tale with many touches of satire and dark humour (love that Muzak score from The Goblins!), Romero tells this story brilliantly, so that watching these characters develop becomes an unforgettable experience. After letting us care deeply about what happens to these people, Romero's offbeat conclusion to the story comes across wonderfully since it goes completely against what we'd be expecting after ""NOTLD"". The unknown cast inhabit their roles so well that's its a shame that they didn't move on to bigger things. While Foree has found lots of steady work throughout the past twenty years (he even got to do an ""X-Files"" episode!), hardly a peep has been heard from his co-stars ever since. But of course, the real stars of the show are the zombies, vividly brought to life by the make-up maestro, Tom Savini (who also has a memorable role as the leader of the biker gang). His gory make-up effects were very shocking for their time and still pack quite a punch today. Not only is this the best sequel ever made, but I'd rank it among the greatest of ALL films. The film offers so much more to an audience than most non-genre films, but the fact that it just happens to contain a lot of disembowelments and fatal head wounds no doubt blinds many people to its merits. If I ran the ""AFI 100"" list, you can bet that this would be among the top ten. Oh yeah... and it's also one hell of a horror flick.",Dawn of the Dead

This movie is great, it has everything, it is well made, it is nice and gorey, it is realistic (seriously, if zombies actually did reign, this is what would more than likely happen), it is funny and also creepy.

295,robertodandi,scary with message,10,6 June 2002,"Dawn of the Dead is a masterpiece. It is really scary and somehow - as I saw recognized in other comments - it has one or more messages. Why it`s so scary? For me the most scary movies are those in which everybody can become the monster, even your brother, your mother, yourself (as said in this movie). However this movie has something more than most of the other horror movies: the atmosphere, the direction and, as I said the messages. One message I found - maybe I`m wrong - is that the situation of the protagonists in the mall and zombies outthere is a metaphor of our situation, the rich western world members that ignore what`s going on outthere, in the third world. Another interpretation could be less `macro`: simply the middle class that doesn`t care of the working class and thinks only to consume (consumerism). However the dichotomy is clearly between those who are rich, few, strong, armed and those who are poor, many, hungry, angry. The scenes when the zombies out of the mall assault some piece of meat all together remind me some medieval movie in which the people was in the identical conditions. As the film was going I felt some simpathy and mercy for the zombies. In sum their only fault was to resurrect. When they ate some of the bikers I felt somehow happy because they deserved this (even if the bikers are human beings at the very end). Is this a `political movie`? I don`t know either the history behind this movie and the story of the director to say this. I can only say that this is absolutely a must see for those who want to discover or already love the horror genre.",Dawn of the Dead
296,Adam_venedam,Absolutely Awesome! Loved It,9,10 July 2014,"I enjoyed every minute of this film! Good characters, good music, and good story! I was hooked the entire way through, it took a few minutes to start to like all the characters but after about 15 minutes I started to love them, especially the black guy! He was awesome.The music was good too, they had some real nice cheesy atmospheric tracks in there which were great! If you don't like old movies and old music though you probably wont like it.The story was very basic, to be honest there is not a whole lot going on, but! This film did not need a great big story when there was so much going on with the characters, there are many different challenges throughout the film the characters go through and everything they do is fresh and different, I don't want to ruin anything but lets just say a ton of stuff goes on which keeps it very interesting.I checked out some other reviews and I was so surprised that some people didn't like it, there main reasons seem to be that its old and cheesy, thats just silly, don't listen to these people, there too brainwashed by the standards of todays films, there just saying that because there comparing it to newer films which in my opinion isn't fair! While I was watching this film though I was actually amazed at how great it really was, I kept thinking to myself ""Damn, this was made in 1978"" I cant put my finger on it exactly but it just seemed very well edited and shot for its time.The sad thing about this is I know many of the people I know would probably fall asleep during this and its ridiculous considering how great this film actually is, and those people have short attention spans and are to brainwashed and programed to be used to newer ""faster paced"" movies, and they laugh at the cheesiness of it or how something has aged, that I never can understand, how can you laugh at something just because its old? There also not laughing at it in a positive way, they laugh in disgust as in they don't even want to see it, if anything its interesting for me because it lets you go back in time, its almost as if these types of people are so used to seeing NEW NEW NEW NEW all the damn time its like they feel and think that its not cool to watch older stuff or something like there just to good for the old, either way whatever reason something seems immature about it to me... Its real annoying to be honest. I find old films are like your elders, when your young you don't really realize how special they really are, but as you get older, the more you start to understand that they mean more",Dawn of the Dead
297,elijahbutler-40119,Simply one of Horror's greatest films! Up there in the Top 5 best Zombie movies of all time!,10,1 November 2020,"Dawn of The Dead (1978) ReviewDirector - George A. RomeroPlot - Two Philadelphia S.W.A.T. team members, a traffic reporter, along with his girlfriend take coverage in a shopping mall, while zombies haven risen from the dead and are out everywhere during an ever-growing epidemic.My experience - Like I said in my review of ""Night of The Living Dead,"" that was the film that opened the gates for our modern zombie subgenre in Horror, which is why it's basically the grandfather of that subgenre! Dawn of The Dead is easily the grandmother of the zombie subgenre! Night of The Living Dead started the zombie subgenre, and Dawn of The Dead basically boosted it up a lot more! George A. Romero once again is a master Horror Director behind the camera, and while watching Dawn of The Dead, you can definitely see the different tone and atmosphere that Romero went for in both films. Where in Night of The Living Dead, he achieved suspense and tension, in Dawn of The Dead, he achieves suspense and action, and for these reasons, Dawn of The Dead is fucking awesome!!!!Dawn of The Dead throws you into the eye of a thrill ride that constantly moves forward and gets so much better with every viewing! The performances are excellent, the soundtrack is miraculous, the action sequences are enthralling, the practical effects and the make up have improved a ton since Night of The Living Dead, Dawn of The Dead gets everything right as a Horror film and as a film in general, which makes it stand out as one of the greatest zombie flicks of all time!The entire movie takes place in this mall with our main heroes and at first glance, that may sound uninteresting, but the characters, the elements, the action sequences, the soundtrack and the zombie effects as a whole are what keep you pinned to your seat, and the entire movie is an absolute blast for these reasons! Ken Foree is excellent in this film! In my opinion, he's the best part of the entire film and he and Scott H. Reindeer, David Eugene and the other actors really have a lot of work to do in this film, and they all do a phenomenal job!Like I said before, the practical effects look absolutely astounding! You can definitely notice that George A. Romero boosted the graphic content of you look back at Night of The Living Dead in 1968, Dawn of The Dead is even way more gorier and violent, and when you throw the action into it, it's definitely not hard to see why Dawn is way more violent! Dawn of The Dead also contains one of my all time favorite scores/soundtracks in Horror history! The music delivers such a 70s bop and creepy vibe to it, and it really gives you an idea of what type of film you're about to witness!The opening of the film is also very suspenseful and exciting, where you see these news stations out of control and all of this chaos striking while the bodies of the dead are out on the loose, it's very suspenseful! Dawn of The Dead also has some very quotable elements from the film, and that's thanks to George A. Romero and the vibe he delivers to this absolute classic Horror film! I'm just going to start by saying, if you haven't seen Dawn of The Dead by now, what the hell are you doing??? Honestly, let's be real, if Dawn along with Night of The Living Dead never existed, we wouldn't even know what ""The Walking Dead,"" or ""The Evil Dead,"" or ""The Cabin in The Woods,"" or even ""28 Days Later"" was! So, if you've never seen Dawn of The Dead, get on it!Honestly though, what more do I have to say about Dawn of The Dead? It's a masterpiece! It has incredible action sequences, along with make up effects, the music, phenomenal acting and absolutely out of this world elements that have influenced so many Horror fanatics for many decades! Mr. Romero, you are a master and your work will forever live on and stand the test of time in Horror!Grade - 10/10",Dawn of the Dead
298,aaronlbacks,Possibly the Best Sequel of All Time,9,2 January 2018,"This sequel in the Living Dead trio improved upon the original in almost every way. Romero directed this film a full decade after the first and the advancements in technology, technical effects, and a bigger budget take the zombie uprising premise and put a new and fascinating story to it, and explore new territory literally and figuratively. Dawn presents the idea better that this phenomenon was world-wide. While it is still mostly filmed in the shopping mall, similar to how the first's setting was solely filmed in an abandoned house, we get a picture of how serious the massacre is through aerial helicopter shots. We get continued racial undertones taken from Night, but these are extrapolated, and a new consumeristic theme is added into the mix. Romero makes the statement blunt, but he says it well: people buy, buy, buy mindlessly like zombies. He almost mocks the American public with how humorful he has all the zombies walking around and slipping on ice rinks and falling in ponds. This comedy was not present in the original, but it certainly was a welcome touch, and there was not a single time a joke or gag did not flop. This movie had me laughing out loud several times. Another improvement was in the special effects department. There is no shortage of gore and cheesy gross-out scenes (my favorite being a crowd of zombies pulling intestines out of a man). I can tell that they are fake, and perhaps if this movie took itself more seriously it would be a detriment, but I feel the over-the-top fake blood actually adds to the movie. The group of four - Stephen/Fly Boy (David Emge), Peter (Ken Foree), Roger (Scott H. Reiniger), and Francine (Gaylen Ross) - play their well-crafted characters fantastically, especially Ken Foree. There was a strong influence from Duane Jone's performance in the original coming through in his part. I thought the symbolism, which was lacking in the original, was a nice touch. And lastly, the steps the four took were smart and logical and had me guessing what would happen next. I really appreciate how Romero added a sort of meditative part halfway through. The characters have built a room and are experiencing restlessness and ennui as to what they could do next, wondering if they could be doing more to help others. Even though they were thrown into this situation, they are still products of their environment and resort to normal life no matter how drab it is, waiting for the excitement of a new purchase, a new hit. The only part that bugged me a little was that there were a few too many shots of zombies just walking around. They were funny, but they began feeling like a litany. But aside from that, it's a brilliant film, and I can't wait to get my hands on Day of the Dead.",Dawn of the Dead

It lacks the strong horror vibe that Night and Day nailed. The socio-political subtext is also incredibly weak in comparison to the powerful subtexts Night and Day had.On the positive side of things though, it's very entertaining, the characters are likable, and the atmosphere is creepy beyond words.",Dawn of the Dead
300,Ithaqua1987,Dawn of the Dead,8,17 December 2004,"George Romero's cult classic sequel to his original ""Night of the Living Dead"" is in some ways, better than the original. The acting is surprisingly good for a movie of this type. Much like ""Night"" dealt with a social subtext (racism), Dawn features an even more prominent one (mass consumerism). Romero drives this point home throughout most of the movie, and sometimes it turns more into a satirical comedy with mindless zombies (AKA shoppers) falling down escalators or hopelessly clawing at the doors of the mall to get in. One of my only complaints about the movie is that the special effects don't hold up in some scenes, mostly because of the blood color. It is a surprisingly orange color instead of a realistic reddish one. I've heard that the filmmakers did this on purpose to make it more of a ""comic book"" movie, but it just doesn't look that good sometimes. The special effects and zombie make-up would be much improved for Dawn's sequel, Day of the Dead.",Dawn of the Dead

Four survivors decide to hold up in a shopping mall and sit out the catastrophe.Review: Bad acting, very bad editing, bad script. The idea is good, though. Character development was probably intended by the director/writer, but you really can't make it out in the movie. The score is awful, annoying the viewer throughout the whole movie, so do the sound effects. Suspense is none in sight.It might have been a top notch movie in the year it came out, but I strongly doubt that. With decent actors, a good writer and someone who knows the meaning of ""special effects"" it would have been a hit, and would still be.If you started watching Zombie Movies with this flick, you probably disagree, saying, nowadays only special effects make up a movie. Well, if you have the choice between a bad movie (like this one) and a bad movie with good special effects, you'll probably choose the latter.

Eventually I managed to track it down and smile as not only had I found the film, it was and would remain to be my favourite zombie movie of all time! To this day this film doesn't get boring for me and I can happily watch it in all of its 2hour 10minute glory! ...Overall this film for me is the cornerstone of all zombie movies. It has your classic Romero zombies (not any of these new day marathon sprinting zombies that can outrun cars) in a setting that is bang on the money!

They accomplished so much with such a small budget and manage to evoke so many different emotions from viewers throughout you can be nothing short of amazed by the finished product. Legendary filmmaker George A. Romero (""Night of the Living Dead"") has with ""Dawn"" created the most ambitious and most satisfying movie of his entire career. It's apocalyptic horror time as four survivors; policemen Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger (Scott H. Reiniger), female newscaster Francine (Gaylen Ross) and her husband Stephen (David Emge) take off in helicopter looking for a safe haven. The world's being destroyed by a plague of sorts, which takes shape as quickly-multiplying flesh eating living dead. One little bite and you will be joining them as they aimlessly shuffle along looking for their next meal. These zombies have taken over not only rural areas (where they began in ""Night""), but also urban areas, and society as a whole is in the process of completely collapsing. Our four reluctant heroes decide if they're going to survive, they need to get as far away from civilization as possible. On their way to wherever (via helicopter), they end up stopping to refuel at a shopping mall and decide it's the perfect place to hide out for a while; seeing how they have all the resources right in one place. They kill all the zombies inside, clear the place out, barricade the doors and try to live as normal a life as possible until they decide what their next move is going to be. The movie plays out impressively in the brilliant mall setting and emerges as intelligent, horrific, exciting and comedic (from the slyest of satire to the most overt of slapstick). It succeeds on so many different levels that people who really don't even enjoy horror films all that much should like it, and yet there's a wealth of scares, suspenseful scenarios and bloody Tom Savini gore effects to keep the horror fans thoroughly entertained.

And all this without the support of a high budget or a numerous crew.

George Romero's classic masterpiece is the benchmark for all others to aspire to. the story is so compelling that one almost forgets the overtones of warning against crass consumerism. that such a marvellous cinematic treat could be produced on such a tight budget just goes to show that, despite the advances made in GCI and special effects, the oldies are indeed the best. after the novelty of living in a mall wears off, the feelings of dissatisfaction and disenchantment portrayed by the cast are almost palpable. Peter (ken foree) displays these feelings best at the end when, faced with a horde of flesh-hungry interlopers, he almost decides that life is no longer worth living. despite being a horror film, this shows such poignancy and depth of feeling towards the human condition that one would be forgiven for forgetting that there are zombies involved. unless, of course, we count the zombie-like state of our constant shoppers. there was a real danger of this film becoming slightly too preachy, but this was cleverly taken care of with the introduction of a pie-fight between zombies and biker raiders. how many films can say that? whatever you may forget about this film (how dare you!), David emge's king zombie won't be one of them. a true cult classic that continues to stand the test of time.",Dawn of the Dead

Act 3 begins.So, to put it in a finishing way, this movie was above average- one of the best zombie movies i've ever seen, but Night of the Living Dead (1968) was better.

It doesn't take into account today's poor, but let's consider them as being the living dead, condemned to wander aimlessly with no chance for improvement or redemption...Or, one could look at this as a fun movie that has some great gore and funny goofs throughout, but either way, it's a brilliant movie.For me, this is a movie that can be watched no matter what one's mood is, and appreciated for what can be done with a few gallons of fake blood and entrails, and a director who knows what he wants to achieve and does so.10 out of 10, because few have met the expectations I've had for horror movies, and this is one of those few. I don't like to be treated like an idiot, I like a message, and I like this message. Watch it if you haven't already, and if it's been a while, dust it off and watch it again, it'll make you appreciate how good we've got it (sitting on our computers in lives of comparable prosperity).Cheers.",Dawn of the Dead
309,HomieG,Night of the Living Dead...in a mall,10,26 June 2001,"From the director of Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead is a masterful horror film that makes you feel almost every human emotion possible.  In my opinion, this movie is better than Night of the Living Dead because there's more zombies and the firepower is more advanced than in the predecessor.  Tom Savini's spectacular gore effects give the movie a visceral feel and for a zombie film the acting is good enough.  Probably the closest someone has ever come to a genuine horror classic (besides ""Psycho""). Rating: 10 out of 10",Dawn of the Dead
310,kminotaur,"Romero raises the bar, twice!",10,3 October 2020,"Just when you think Romero can revolutionize the horror genre with Night Of The Living Dead, he does it again, and raises the bar higher with Dawn. Hands down, one of the best horror movies of all time.",Dawn of the Dead
311,bdeyes81,One of the Greatest Sequels AND One of the Best Horror Films Ever,10,4 November 2001,"This review refers to the theatrical cut of the film. When George A. Romero's no-budget horror movie Night of the Living Dead hit screens in 1968, the same year that had already given audiences the all time genre classic Rosemary's Baby, no one could have predicted the indelible effect it would have on the history of cinema. The film introduced audiences to a degree of graphic violence never before witnessed on American screens. However, it was the film's intense, omnipotent terror that forever scarred a generation of viewers. Although the film enjoyed unprecedented mainstream success for an independent production, the filmmakers saw little of the movie's earnings. Romero's string of box office disappointments in the years to follow would diminish his clout in Hollywood, and as such he found it was an uphill battle to fund his ambitious sequel to the film. Then along came Italian horror maestro Dario Argento, hot off the heels of such international blockbusters as Deep Red and Suspiria. Argento helped secure funding for the film, in exchange for the rights to personally oversee the international cut of the film. The collaboration would be a match made in horror movie heaven, for the end product would be Dawn of the Dead, one of the most acclaimed and enduringly popular horror movies of all time. Dawn of the Dead's plot is so effectively simple, and now thoroughly familiar, that it almost goes without description. While the world approaches a still unexplained and ever growing zombie apocalypse, four individuals-two millitary men, a helicopter pilot, and his TV reporter girlfriend-barricade themselves in an abandoned suburban shopping mall. The mall provides fodder not only for the film's well known social commentary, but also for some truly thrilling-if not terrifying-setpieces.With its graphic depictions of human evisceration, exploding heads, and gruesome flesh eating, Dawn of the Dead may well be the goriest American film of all time. The film is actually so violent and gruesome that it was released unrated in the United States for fear of being slapped with an X Rating. That didn't stop the film from being a huge hit at home and abroad. The film earned rave reviews from critics (most famously, from Roger Ebert, who called it `one of the best horror movies of all time'). It instantly became recognized not only as a genre classic, but also as one of the sharpest social satires of the decade, with its often hilarious commentary on an ever growing consumer culture embodied by the film's mall location.Internationally, the film was even bigger. The movie was released in a special 117 minute cut overseas (the US theatrical version was 120 minutes) which was edited by Dario Argento and featured a more prominent presentation of the soundtrack by rock band Goblin as well as a much faster overall pace. Released in most countries as `Zombie: Dawn of the Dead' or `Zombies', it was so big in Italy that the following year Lucio Fulci, previously a director of `giallo' thrillers, helmed a gory semi-sequel. His `Zombie 2', released in the US as `Zombie', would become one of the most popular drive in hits of the 1970s, a massive international success that solidified the zombie/cannibal craze of the early 1980s and sparked Lucio Fulci's own reign as a horror movie icon. Dawn of the Dead is a truly stunning example of the horror genre's ability to produce works that are as socially relevant as they are terrifying, films which break free of the constraints of conventional horror movie elements and in doing so establish themselves as being truly timeless. While I would still give Night of the Living Dead the slight edge between the two, Dawn of the Dead is still an extraordinary film in its own right as well as an almost superior sequel to another of the scariest movies ever made.",Dawn of the Dead
312,ZOMBlE,Let's go to the mall!,10,5 March 2006,"Most likely the second best zombie film ever made, and in some ways the very best, George A. Romero's original Dawn of the Dead really stands the test of time. The sequel was good, but there's only one Dawn. Not only are the zombies themselves great characters, but the people they're killing and eating are interesting and sympathetic. Horror movies often present bloodthirsty monsters killing cardboard cut-out victims. Not the case with Dawn of the Dead, where the people are people. We care about them, and we feel sorry when they die, unlike the Friday the 13th movies where we just sit around bored, waiting for the next person to get his throat cut. So if you haven't seen this one, go see it. And if you have, look quick for Joe Polato, who ended up starring in Day of the Dead.",Dawn of the Dead
313,IDs_Ego,Best of the Three,9,28 September 2004,"Haven't even seen the 2004 remake. If you see all 3 of George's, save the best- this one- for last. While clearly low-budget, it deftly gives action, intensity, soul and a graspable sense of realness to the loss of the world as we know it. If you weren't around in 70's America, it also plucks that string with wonderful resonance. It has squib-happy gore, but should be considered the classic it is for every other reason. It it not a tired suspense horror flick, it's an insightful human story, with zombies pounding at the door. More than frightening- much more. This hits the mark, where ""Day of"" misses, as I describe in my review there.If you are ANY kind of film-goer, this is a must-see.",Dawn of the Dead
314,angrymidget19,Wow . . . . .,10,3 August 2005,"This is an excellent movie. It has horrific special effects (especially for a film with as low a budget as this). It has great acting, and realistic characters. After redefining the horror genre with Night of the Living Dead"" George A. Romero released this in 1978, and he shocked audiences around the country with his no-nonsense approach to the cannibalistic monstrosities. As for the 2004 remake of this film, in my opinion, this one is much better. It has more story, more action, and more gore (so much in fact, that the distributors wanted to give it an X rating, but settled with it as ""unrated""). Keep in mind, though, when you see this movie remember that it was filmed on only $500,000, so don't expect it to have as good of special effects as the remake.",Dawn of the Dead
315,elwyn5150,Impressive and influential,9,29 February 2000,"I gave this film 9/10. I'm not a big fan of horror but I found myself greatly impressed with this film.As I watched this film the other night, I saw how it (or the series) has made such a great influence on pop culture whether it is from The Simpson's Halloween episodes to the computer game Doom to the self-service carry-lots of collecting weapons in ""The Matrix"".",Dawn of the Dead
316,thelegendarywd,THE GOLD STANDARD TO JUDGE ALL ZOMBIE FILMS BY!!!,10,23 June 2003,"Yes, the excellent Night of the Living Dead started it all and is one of the greatest horror/zombie/classics of all time. But it's sequel, Dawn of Dead, is the pinnacle of the genre. It is the height other zombie films try to reach and few come close. It is a film that proves that classic originals can have superior sequels (along with Aliens, The Empire Strikes Back, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom... in my opinion, and The Road Warrior). This film has everything a zombie film fan could hope for: flesh chomping, gut ripping, head chopping, brain shooting... in other words, true zombie mayhem.But to only credit this film with the excellent Tom Savini gore effects would overlook the fact that it is an expertly made film. I mean, this is a ZOMBIE film over 2 HOURS LONG!!! If this film were made by someone who didn't know what they were doing it would have gotten old real quick! Romero knows how to frighten us, disgust us, thrill us, disturb us, and even make us laugh occasionally.The film basically shows the world after becoming more and more infested with the zombies that were introduced in the original. It seems as if the world is about half zombies and half human. It follows a mixed bag of humans searching for a safer place to live in a helicopter. They come upon an abandoned shopping mall and land on the roof. The mall proves to have everything they need to be happy so they proceed to exterminate the zombies that inhabit it and clean them out. All goes pretty well for a while until a motorcycle gang wants the kind of goodies the mall can provide.I don't want to give too much away for the people who haven't seen this EXCELLENT classic... but I will hint at some of my favorite scenes:The entire opening SWAT sequence in the housing project building (very suspenseful... very gory). - The zombie children attack. - The zombie vs. helicopter blade scene. - The mall shopping spree & zombie clean up scene. - The semi-truck moving scene. - The motorcycle gang vs. protagonists vs. zombies climax.There are many more reasons to watch this film but the best reason is that it is totally entertaining. Also don't forget to check out part three of the Romero ""Dead"" films, Day of the Dead (another excellent film) and let's all hope that he is able to make the fourth... Twilight of the Dead (a title I think is much better than the updated title Dead Reckoning)! Also, for more excellent Zombie carnage I would recommend Lucio Fulci's Zombie (aka Zombi 2, semi-sequel to Dawn, which was released in Italy as Zombi), Return of the Living Dead, and Peter Jackson's Dead Alive. I've also got my hopes up for 28 Days Later to be the return of the true zombie movie... and let's keep our fingers crossed that the Dawn remake next year is not a piece of garbage.",Dawn of the Dead
317,jackbruns29,The greatest horror movie of all time,9,3 January 2021,"Hands down this is my favorite horror movie ever. I won't get into the details or spoilers of the movie, as I'm sure plenty of other people have commented on. But the setting, the characters, the themes, the atmosphere...everything about this movie is perfect. Just perfection. The believable ways people are cracking under the surreal fact that the dead truly are coming alive and feasting on the living - how seriously this movie takes it. I can see why some younger people might find it slow or boring, but if you're mature enough of mind to let the story play out, I highly recommend it. Forget the exploitive 2004 version. This is the real deal.The only thing keeping it from a pure 10, is that as much as I adore this movie, even I have to admit some of the special effects haven't really held up. The blood looks orange. And the zombies are basically painted blue for the most part.",Dawn of the Dead
318,ww_sketcher,A surprisingly good sequel to the classic Night of the Living Dead,7,9 February 2005,"Being a sequel to a classic horror film that was released 10 years earlier, Dawn of the Dead had a lot to live up to as a sequel. Did it return? Well...somewhat.Dawn of the Dead has it's high points, unlike the ultra low budget outings of Night of the Living Dead, Dawn has extremely nice visuals from gnawed gory zombies, to the zombie who gets into accidents with a screw driver, to helicopter mishaps, it's a visual treat. This would mean nothing if it didn't have a background meaning to back it which it does with it's satire of pop consumerism and racism being drawn in, even if they seem a bit embarrassingly drawn out at times, instead of placed a lot more subtly in Night of the Living Dead.The only items really holding back Dawn are that it's pacing is rather laid back and often story is a little off, as there are times where characters seem a little confusing in their behavior, which was more logical in Night of the Living Dead. Also, even with the film's satirical message, this movie seems more or less a gore-filled action movie underneath it all, with guns shootings, to the gang of bikes taking up more of the film's time then scenes where you feel that truly hopeless emotion that i felt from Night of the Living Dead. Which is a mixed-blessing in the long run, as these scenes can be a nice treat.So is Dawn of the Dead the true Horror Classic? Well, yes and no, it's more memorable and better then your average Horror, and fans of the genre will definitely want too see this, but if you must see only one Zombie film, your bet is to see the original Night of the Living Dead, but this is still a fairly worthy sequel.7/10.",Dawn of the Dead
319,DirectionWritten,"An overly long, and painfully boring film",3,23 June 2016,"Expecting a thrilling ride, I was suckered into renting this based on it's incredible reputation among horror fans, and critics alike. Quotes from notable film critics like Roger Ebert saying things like ""The Best Horror Film Of All Time"" and ""Scariest Film Ever Made"" are what made me have to see for myself. I now wish I hadn't wasted my time on this God-awful movie. How can a film as boring, cheesy, and lame as this one be so highly regarded? It looks as though the actors playing the zombies jumped into a pool of blue paint. They aren't scary or menacing in the slightest, and what probably contributes to that is the fact that they walk after their victims, at about a snail's pace.The film's first twenty minutes did have me briefly interested, but after the band of four survivors get into the mall, it all goes down hill from there and the pace really slows down. If you want to see a movie that's second half consists solely of bad actors crying and whining about stuff (not convincingly), then I suggest that you checkout ""Dawn Of The Dead"". Otherwise, if you don't want to fall asleep during a movie, there are plenty of other zombie films out there miles better than this one.Grade: D",Dawn of the Dead
320,Our_Feature_Presentation,Dawn of the Dead: The Dead will walk the Earth,10,17 January 2014,"1978, a decade ago George Romero shocked the world with Night of the Living Dead, now he does it again with the ultimate zombie movie, Dawn of the Dead. Dawn of the Dead ups the gore and shows it all in full color. The gore effects are done by Tom Savini and boy do they look amazing and well thought out. The movie is full of many things that separates it from all other zombie movies. Mainly good strong characters that you root for. Other things that sets it apart is it's impact, social commentary and a well thought out script. First I'll talk about the script; unlike most horror movies the script is good, as I said it's full of good characters but also it has fun and interesting events happening and great sharp and realistic dialog. Second, this movie wasn't just a regular pure entertainment movie, yes it's entertaining but it takes itself one step further by adding thought provoking commentary, comparing mass consumers to zombies. Third, the movie had an impact, people saw it and remembered it for the rest of their lives, the movie has become a part of pop culture. Now as a horror movie it still has great suspense and such, but for me the scariest thing about this movie is seeing how society has torn itself apart, seeing the way regular people are beaten to mere shells of their former selves; that's what I found scary for the big reason that it would happen in our real world. Also, surprisingly, for a horror movie it has plenty of action, when zombies are being killed, when humans are killing humans all of it is some pretty good action. And finally before I say my thoughts, the movie has one of my favorite movie scores EVER, its a mix of rock and techno that surprisingly works incredibly well. In the end Dawn of the Dead (1978) is a zombie movie that sets itself apart from others with its, gore effects, characters, smart script, social commentary, action, music and all around fun, Dawn of the Dead is in my top 10 movies ever and it gets a 10 out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead

It is just one of those movies you'd like to own for yourself. An absolute must see for everyone - be they zombie movie lovers, or just average people.

322,koomy,Vastly Overrated,5,5 February 2008,"This was only the second time I've seen it but i think its vastly overrated. It starts off well with chaos and panic at a TV station, explaining the situation and then helicopter shots showing the scale of the outbreak. The refuelling stop is the best part of the film; its a shame the rest of the film didn't continue that mood. The setting in the Shopping Mall is a good idea but once they've set up their base its becomes pretty dull - mainly cos the zombies aren't scary or presented as any sort of threat. The make up isn't great - the zombies are a rather fetching pale blue(!) - hardly scary, just a bit lame. The vague comedy elements are poor and the film become dire once the biker gang turns up. And everyone goes on about the social satire - yes its very blatant but having a message of social satire doesn't make it a good film. I think it should be plot first, social commentary second. It seems the director had a good idea of setting it in the mall and then it all falls apart.In three separate places this week I've seen DotD described as the 'best Zombie film'. It clearly isn't - its not even the best zombie film by Romero (that would be 'Night Of The Living Dead'). This is an influential film and one to see if you like this genre but its actually not very good.",Dawn of the Dead

Its probably not gonna terrify anyone anymore but it definitely still packs a punch. This and night of the living dead are the only 2 zombie films that i'd say were ""must see"" films.

It's a combination of post-apocalypse dread thrilling action and smart humor that's hard to pull off.There is no real story arc in this film. It starts in a local news station beginning to fall apart and follows the main characters as they eventually come upon an abandoned shopping mall (abandoned by humans at least). The simplicity of the story makes it easy to get immersed into,. At the crux of it, this is just a story of survival.The violence and gore in this movie can be quite cartoonish and unrealistic. (Unintentionally I think) Most of the zombies end up looking blue and the blood is a bright red, but it ends up working in favor for this film, juxtaposing a grounded story and characters to create a surreal kind of imagery.There are a lot of different cuts of this film, the one I watch (and based this review on) is the 2Hr19min cut.

And only twice in my entire life have i found anyone who has disliked this movie ( one of which being my sister ). The film is one of the most intelligent horror films ever made. It quite cynically shows that we as a society would crumble in a situation such as this for the reason that we would more be fighting each other than the enemy at hand. Also it pretty much documents the rise of consumerism, in two ways:one, the characters feel that they are just fine as long as they have these material things, two, the zombies come back in instinct. This was one of the most important pars of their normal lives, & they try endlessly to get in. The story ( if you don't already know it) concerns a group of survivors, 2 swat team members, 2 television station employees ) steal a traffic helicopter & take to the skies to find a safer place of refuge. After a day of danger & no luck, they stumble upon a shopping mall. They hole up in a sort of emergency shelter in the roof, & slowly begin to make the mall theirs. Once they have cleared all the zombies out of the mall, they live like french kings, living it up while the poor starve outside their ""castle"". But a looting biker gang brakes their way in, & our main protagonists try to fight for what they have successfully stolen. The makeup is top notch, (i like blue-faced zombies), the gore is awesome, the music, catchy is an under statement, every little thing about this film is excellent.

Friday the 13th is a good follow up to the genre with a nice twist at the end. Nightmare on Elm Street has the greatest villain ever created with a completely new notion (you die in your dreams). Hellraiser takes you to an incredible crazy world of gore. The Shinning is touched with the genius of Kubrick. And I could go on and on, quoting classics and discussing the reasons why they became cult movies for hours.But this? What the hell is this? How can this underdog movie become a classic? How can someone like this stuff? Terrible acting, even worse effects (if you don't have the money to do it right, DON'T DO IT!), the story has more holes than swiss cheese and the ending is just ridiculous! The more I think about it the more I hate it. I never understood the ""so bad it's good"" concept. This is so bad it's bad!

I say this not because of its wild special effects, not because of its extremely scary plotline, but for its striking realism.  Lets face it, more or less, if Zombies did rule the earth (work with me here) it would be a lot like this movie.  The main characters of the movie are all likable in and of themselves, the plotline is well thought out, keeping you interested, and the story has definite direction, as opposed to many horror films leading you to a dead end and wondering what just happened when the movie ends.  Instead of just chopping everything in sight like in most horror films, Dawn of the Dead seems to remember that its just not that simple and deals with the moral, ethical and emotional ideas of killing, and in this case why it is neccessary for survival.  Dawn of the Dead is without a doubt the most realistic survival horror film too date, mix this with the strange and humourous original music, and you have one of the best horror films of all time      10 of 10",Dawn of the Dead
330,CULTEGUY,This is one of the greats!,10,19 April 2003,"I've finally decided to write a review of this one. But, first I would like to say, I'd loved to have seen this one in a drive in, with popcorn & beer, next to a honey... Miss those days. This movie should be seen by anyone serious about making films. I'm not a sci-fi fan, an f/x fan, apart of the zombie cult-- juat a film fan.I first saw this in my teens, in a really ragged out beta format. I know some things differed from the version I recently saw (I think there were some zombie hooters in that one.) Here's a quick breakdown:Acting: Alright for the type, actually quite good.Cinematagraphy: Brilliant, more than you'd expect.Gore: It's a damn Zombie movie!Narrative: Trapping some members of a SWAT in a mall with a pregnant woman... Zombie's being there because it's something they remembered. The world gone mad outside the mall... Power shopping. Good stuff.People, I would put this movie out myself-- totally uncut (150+ mins.) and issue it to film schools. Should be in a power pack with ""Document of the Dead."" Should be cheaper and easier to get than Amazon's 30-80 dollar price.
Movie's more likable than most of the genre, and may even be better classified as an action movie. You'd be more disappointed in NOTLD if you're not at all a fan of the sub-culture, so seek it out. Hell, your mom probably even saw it and liked it.",Dawn of the Dead
331,Mr_Blonde3,"""One stop shopping. Everything you need, right at you fingertips.""",10,2 May 2004,"A couple of months ago, I got the opportunity of a lifetime to see ""Reservoir Dogs"", one of my favorite movies, at the theatre. Then, a while ago, the theatre I saw ""RD"" in was showing Romero's version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" as their midnighter. I assume it was in conjunction with the remake, though they showed it after the remake was out of the mainstream theatres. I became a fan of the movie recently, having bought the Divimax edition of the film a few days before I saw the remake. Needless to say, I was first in line for a ticket.I must say that I liked this version better than the remake, but I don't want to spend this review comparing the differences between the two. I will say though, I like the slow zombies in this better than the fast zombies in the remake.Romero has created the diffinative zombie movie here. It's easily the best of the trilogy, and I'm almost positive it will be the best in the quadrilogy, should Mr. Romero get the funding to do a fourth film in the series. His first, ""NOTLD"" was an excellent horror movie, but it was hampered with the annoying character of Cooper, who was obviously going to bite it. Plus, the tone of this film is much more lighthearted, ""NOTLD"" was very grim. Here the audience gets the opportunity to have fun with the characters. ""Day of the Dead"" had some of the lightheartedness of this film, but it was hampered with the annoying characters of Rhodes and Steele, who were also obviously going to bite it. In this film, the four leads are all likeable, though I will admit that it takes us a little while to warm up to one character, but I'll discuss him further along. Don't get me wrong, I love ""NOTLD"", both the original, and the remake, and I love ""Day"" I just think that out of all of the films, ""Dawn"" is Romero at his best.
The plot, in a nutshell, is this: A news station's helicopter pilot/traffic reporter, Stephen,  (David Emge) and his pregnant, on-again, off-again girlfriend Frannie, (Gaylen Ross) who works as one of the station's technicians, decide to steal the network's traffic chopper (It's more his idea than hers) and seek refuge in Canada. Stephen has invited his friend Roger, (Scott H. Reiniger) a Philadelphia SWAT team member. Roger questions whether it's right to run, but a disastrous excursion in a low-rent housing district, which harms more people than it helps, finally convinces him that he needs to get the h*ll out of dodge. While at the building in the low-rent district, he meets and befriends Peter, (Fen Foree) a fellow SWAT member. Roger figures one more won't hurt the group, so he invites Peter along. The group takes to the skies, but a lack of fuel grounds them temporarily at a shopping mall. At first, they just want to rest there for a little while, but eventually they decide that everything they need is at the mall, and they begin making provisions to seal the mall from the undead and become kings of the castle. But it's not going to be easy.Those who only see this film as a horror movie will be dissappointed. While it definitely has it's horrific elements, it's not strictly a horror movie. It's a mix of Horror, Satire, Comedy, Fantasy and Action. Romero summed it up best: It's a big, sprawling, comic book, complete with bright red cartoonish blood. ""Dawn"" is also very much a social satire. When it was made, shopping malls were just starting to spring up, and consumerism was just starting to reach it's peak. The zombies are partially intended to represent mall shoppers on a typical day, wandering aimlessly from store to store as canned music plays hypnotically in the backround. It's a clever stab, and it works very well without upseting the ""comic book horror"" feel of the movie.The characters are probably the best drawn in a horror film, ever. rarely have I watched a horror film and been so attached to the characters as I was in this. You have the natural leader, Peter, who always uses his head to make descisions, At first he's the outsider of the group, And since he's the only one of the group who's black, it ads to the tension. But his natural strengths come through and he becomes the eventual leader of the group. Peter is very much like Ben from ""NOTLD"" but with a little better decision making skills and no one getting in his way. Peter is my second favorite character in the film, topped only by Roger. The character of Roger, who's basically Peter's  second in command, but who is almost as  resourceful as Peter, is my favorite in the film. He's very much the class clown, a needed bit of comic relief in a world going to h*ll. Roger, like Peter, is for the most part cool under pressure, and for a little guy, he's one of the coolest characters ever put to screen, almost rivaling Peter. When you watch the movie, and see some of the things he does, you just can't help but like the guy. Stephen, however, is the most complex of the characters. At first, he seems like a sullen jerk, And he's almost set up to be an embodiment of the Cooper character from ""NOTLD"" but as the film progresses, he opens up, and we discover that not only is he helpful in a pinch, and very resorceful, but we also discover that some of his sulleness comes from the fact that he feels inferior to his male buddies, since he's not as trained in combat as they are, and he can't shoot at all like they can. And finally, there's Frannie, who's viewed as the weak link because she is a woman, and pregnant. But Frannie isn't as weak as they think, and she makes it very clear that she is going to be as much a part of the group as the guys, pregnant or not. She's resourceful as well, coming up with good ideas to help the group finish the tasks they need to. She has a few moments where she acts like Barbara from ""NOTLD"" but not very often, and she thankfully doesn't spend the entire movie alternately screaming and sitting in a catatonic state. They are all great characters, and they do a minimum of stupid things, which is wonderful, as nothing is more annoying than screaming at a movie character NOT to do something, then watching them do it and get killed. They occasionally have errors of judgement, but hey, everyone does at some point or other, and they are not out of context of the characters. It's not done just so something bad will happen to them or so it will undermine what they are doing.What the audience will have the most fun with is the mall itself. It very much becomes a 5th character, and it puts to screen the fantasy of: What would you do if you had a shopping mall all to yourself? Surely everyone has wandered about a shopping mall and thought to themselves, ""I wonder what it would be like if I had all this to myself?"" But it's not all roses, and eventually, it becomes a prison to the characters, very much becoming a ""Guilded Cage"".And I also must give a nod to the music of Goblin. Though only a 1/4th of their music is used in the theatrical release, it's very fun, my favorite song of theirs is when Roger and Peter are moving the first truck.I loved this movie, and I can't wait for the 3 or 4 or 5 disc (No one knows for sure how many) set that it scheduled to come out in the fall from Anchor Bay. The movie has fared well, and it was extremely fun to see it on the big screen, even though the print is starting to wear out, and the sound wasn't always great, but it was good enough.To close, if you are looking for a moderately scary movie with great characters, get this one. It's not extremely dated, the acting is, for the most part great, (You have to cut them some slack, for three of the actors, this was their first movie) and it moves along at a good pace. Again, I can't stress this enough, don't just watch this as a horror movie, watch it on all levels, and I promise you you'll enjoy it. I certainly did.
10/10*****/*****Two thumbs WAY up!",Dawn of the Dead
332,max-swindlehurst,The Greatest Zombie Film of all Time,10,21 July 2012,"Few filmmakers now how to do a zombie movie and get it right; I hate to think what the zombie movie genre would be without George Romero. 1968's Night of the Living Dead is still the archetype of zombie films, in my opinion, featuring a virtually perfect ending. 1979's follow-up, Dawn of the Dead, is another true classic, featuring scenes so shocking that absolutely no one under 17 could be admitted to theaters to see it. By today's standards, the film is hardly shocking at all, but Romero's up close and personal look at a nihilistic world simply crawling with the undead is the kind of movie that makes horror lovers stand up and cheer. The level of violence in this film is delightfully high; sure, it all looks pretty fake now, but in its day Dawn of the Dead helped lay the groundwork for later gorefests full of blood and guts. I don't, as a general rule, care for zombies or zombie movies. Zombies are ugly and stupid - they basically just wander around in a clumsy manner, only reacting to the nearness of human life fresh for the taking (and eating). That's about all they do here, as well, but at least they turn out in huge numbers for this George Romero classic. We don't know what started the trouble; as the movie opens, the world is already in a heap of a mess. There are cops and soldiers killing zombies by the dozens, but it's obviously just a few bloods drops in the proverbial bucket. TV news coverage features experts saying how bad everything is and how we should have taken action sooner, demanding people leave their self-barricaded homes and come together in a dwindling number of central locations. Roger DeMarco (Scott H. Reiniger) flies his girlfriend Francine (Gaylen Ross) and friend Stephen Andrews (David Emge) out of town in a helicopter - Stephen's sharp-shooting buddy Peter Washington (Ken Foree) also comes along for the ride. Low on gas and unsure of what they should do, the gang lands on the roof of a large shopping mall and eventually decides to hole up there for a while. Isolating themselves upstairs, our would-be survivors then begin making forays inside the mall for necessary supplies. The place is crawling with pasty-faced zombies, so they put together a plan that will, or so they hope, keep additional zombies from gaining access to the site; once that is done, it's just a matter of killing all of the zombies already stumbling around inside. Of course, as we all know, people are stupid, so this prolonged stay inside the mall faces its share of challenges and dangers. Along the way, countless numbers of zombies are shot, bludgeoned, and taken out with whatever deadly instruments one happens to find handy. Never fear, there is some zombie feeding as well, although once again I have to express my disappointment that no brains were ever eaten (zombies are supposed to eat brains - that's my personal zombie philosophy). One question hovers near the front of your mind throughout this film: how will it end? The world has basically come to an end, making for some long odds for our heroes' survival. While the ending is not completely satisfying, I do believe it makes for a right and fitting conclusion to this most extraordinary of horror classics.Let me speak to the violence portrayed here. However shocking it was upon the movie's release, it really isn't shocking at all in this day and age; the quantity of violence, though still impresses. Plenty of zombies fall over the course of these two hours plus, but few of the ""deaths"" are what I would call gory. In many cases, a zombie takes a shot between the eyes and falls down; in some cases there is blood, especially when zombies get a chance to do a little feeding, but you certainly won't see anybody lying in a pool of blood. In many cases, a zombie gets taken out with no blood at all - certainly, the amount of gore you would expect from shotgun blasts to the head just doesn't exist here. The blood, I might also mention, doesn't even look like blood - unless red corpuscles changed to orange corpuscles without anyone telling me.In the end, it comes down to this: Dawn of the Dead is one of the best zombie films ever made - more than that, it's one of the best horror films ever made. It cemented George Romero's name in the hallowed shrines of horror; it crossed the Rubicon (or perhaps I should say the river Styx) and dared to give viewers the quantity of senseless violence so many of us crave. There is also a sociological slant to the movie that many feel compelled to comment on (I personally think it's something of a stretch to classify four desperate, would-be survivors as some type of bourgeoisie enjoying the luxury the shopping mall affords them while the nameless hordes of plebeian zombies mill around aimlessly). However you want to interpret it, Dawn of the Dead is horror at its very best, up close and in your face.",Dawn of the Dead
333,m_johnson97,I wanted to like it,2,28 June 2019,"I've seen the remake multiple times, this is my first time watching the original. I wish I'd seen it first. It's so boring.",Dawn of the Dead
334,sullymazda,"A Short Review, But More A statement of Fact",6,7 March 2015,"I saw this film in 1979, when it first premiered, with a bunch of my friends. One of them, about ten minutes into it, said that he failed to understand it, that it didn't make sense, etc. He wasn't 100% wrong. Because it starts off with the chaos at the TV Station, followed by the slaughter by the SWAT Team at the public housing complex.It is unclear as to what the mayhem is all about. We do not see a zombie until approximately fifteen minutes (when the husband takes a chomp out of his wife's shoulder, probably the scene that is most difficult to watch) into the film. It was at THAT point where my buddy nodded his head as if to say ""A-Ha! Now I get it"". It turned out that he had never seen the first film. I think that there were some friends of Romero who communicated the very same perspective to him, because he corrected it in the opening to the third installment, the unfairly maligned ""Day of the Dead"". There, with Sarah's (Lori Cardille) horrific dream of gray hands shooting through the wall--truly a terrifying sequence--, followed by the anxiety of her boyfriend and co-pilot in the whirlybird witnessing the extent of the undead population below, a superior foundation is laid. The point is that even the great Roger Ebert himself has made the error of referring to each film in the series as a ""sequel"" to the one that preceded it. ""Dawn of the Dead"" is not--repeat, NOT--a sequel to ""Night of the Living Dead"". Sure, it is another zombie film from the same director, but doesn't continue the story line from the first film nor does it have any of the same characters or even actors.Parenthetically, ""DAY"" isn't a follow-up to ""Dawn"". Example. Think here. ""The Godfather Part II"" is a sequel to ""The Godfather"" (if I hear one more guy refer to the first film as ""The Godfather, Part 1"", I'm going to go postal). Michael, Fredo, Connie. No Sonny, Tessio, or Carlo--all killed by the conclusion of the first movie-- until the brilliant flashback (to the seventh of December 1941) sequence Michael has at the end of the second. One last thing. I had mentioned earlier that Romero probably responded to criticism of ""Dawn"", and proceeded to rectify it in ""Day"". The proof is in the carnage. The gore at the end of ""Dawn of the Dead"" is Kabuki- style, almost funny (especially when that one biker--possibly the stupidest man ever put on screen--insists on checking his blood pressure.Not a good decision on his part.) The final fifteen minutes of ""Day of the Dead""--not so much.I defy anyone--even with the ammunition of nervous laughter--to chuckle at any point throughout that sequence.I saw the third film in the movies(needless to say, before it was released on video). You know how I felt when I left the theater? Exhausted.",Dawn of the Dead
335,qdude440,Attention Zombie Shoppers,10,23 July 2005,"Dawn of the Dead is George A. Romero's follow up to the 1968 classic Night of the Living Dead. Whereas Night before it and Day and Land of the Dead after it contained more of a realistic sense of dark, apocalyptic mayhem, Dawn of the Dead provides space for that plus a lot of social satire. It contains more 'fun' moments than those three films combined. Not to say its better than them, but it certainly has more of a lighter edge. As has probably been said, its not just one of the greatest sequels of all time, but one of the greatest horror movies as well.The film centers around 4 people, who escape the mayhem of Philadelphia in a helicopter, and with a stroke of luck come across an abandoned mall. The film follows up on Night of the Living Dead's zombie epidemic perfectly. The world has gotten a little more prepared but isn't still yet used to the whole idea of zombies. People, instead of working together, have gone off and formed their little own survival cliques, as evidenced throughout the movie.Peter {Foree}, Steven {Emge}, Fran {Ross], and Roger {Reiniger} eventually take hole in the mall and use it to their advantage. After clearing out the mess of undead, they move in fully and have the mall all to themselves. Its with the mall that the film shows how consumerism can take over the mind, no matter where or when. The film's social commentary is perfect for its time, and Romero uses the mall as a tool for his point.Once again, the zombies aren't the human's biggest enemy in this film. The human survivors fall back, and even with a hoard of flesh eating zombies around, all the survivors can do is fight with each other. Sometimes, we the audience feels propelled to believe that the zombie race may be a bit smarter in ways than the human race.But even with the darker undertones, the film still has a light feel to it. The humans routinely take advantage of the zombies lack of brains. Some scenes are actually downright comedic {And I believe the humor is plenty intentional}. The zombie makeup effects were groundbreaking in their day, and still can pack a punch today if you're not used to graphic gore. Not to mention a classic soundtrack, ranging from catchy library track music to a rock score performed by director Dario Argento's band Goblin. Even though the production values may feel campy, this is not a film to be missed. It is fun to watch, contains great character depth, and unlike the recent Land of the Dead, the social commentary doesn't feel forced at all. Out of all the zombie films, this remains the quintessential epic even nearly 30 years later.",Dawn of the Dead
336,nealoade,A Cut Above,9,29 January 2020,"A couple of years later and this movie would have never been made. Big studios were desperate to capitalise on the raw, independent, freewheeling American film-making of the 1970s. They spent so much of the 80s trying and failing to nail down that formula. In my opinion, for that formula you can look no further than 'Dawn of the Dead', a surprising triumph.If this movie ended after the first act (just over an hour in), it would still be a substantial and meaningful milestone in cinema. The second act is also fantastic.'Dawn' hurtles at breakneck pace from set-piece to set-piece, framed and devised by director George A. Romero specifically to deliver maximum thrills and chills. Master of the B-Movie Dario Argento consults and in scenes such as the breathless cat and mouse chase in a mall basement by an unknown number of assailants and an endless number of shadows, his distinct touch is obvious.Romero, a could be auteur, utilises Argento's flair for dramatic scenarios and framing and compounds it with characters that are far beyond that of his mentor, with a meaning that is very much his own. In every moment, each character is defined and refined, humanised and dehumanised, lost in mayhem and brought back again.But the scariest thing this film does? Pits four very smart, capable characters, with very seperate skillsets, working excellently as a team against hordes of the undead and still makes them lose.In Romero's nightmare, even the strong will not survive. A damn near masterpiece, the best zombie movie ever made to this day, one of the best horror movies of all time, and a highlight of the decade.",Dawn of the Dead

The first time I saw this, I was amazed at the way Roger was killed.  Usually, when a major character is killed it's either in some ""heroic"" sacrafice or trying to look like it's no big deal. Roger's death is the exception.  George Romero is a god.  I remember the first time that I saw this movie, right after the ""head shot"".  I was thinking, you can't show that.  It was one of the first and few movies that really blew me away.",Dawn of the Dead

Upon reading this I was foolishly suckered in and rented it out looking forward to having the living daylights scared out of me! Instead, I had a laughing attack not afforded to me since childhood! It really berates the horror genre when this movie is considered a classic. Its boredom all the way as people that look as though they've been face painted at the local church fete pass themselves off as zombies. A man on crutches heavily sedated could outrun these flesh-eating fiends. So to summarise, the make-up is poor, the script works well as a comedy and the film is as about as scary as a rice pudding without jam!",Dawn of the Dead

Savini's great special effect's (espically for the 70's) make's this film a zombie movie classic. Savini's stunts are excellent. Romero did a perfect job casting and directing this film which is the second in the dead film's. I have so much to say about this excellent film but fear I will give too much away. I have seen this film over 30 times and notice a new zombie every time and never grow tired of this film. If you do not like horror movies this film will convert you.

341,astonmartin7,"Not really a horror film, just a masterwork",10,18 February 2007,"George A. Romero's second Dead film is truly a masterwork. It's a film that gets better and better the more you see it. The extended 139 minute cut is spectacular and is so original in it's intent and presentation that it almost seems like a different film each time it's viewed. It's almost like a symphony, thanks to Romero's direction, the photography and especially the editing. Romero constantly jerks the audience around by shifting tone and focus in his plot and character development.The main action occurs in a Pennsylvania shopping mall that the four protagonists have holed up in. Even though two of the main characters (played by Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger) are SWAT team members, we can empathize with their survivalist plight and the suspense of the film comes from an innate human instinct to survive at all costs.The other protagonists, Steven and Fran (David Emge and Gaylen Ross) make an interesting, modern 1970s couple with the usual relationship problems turned on their head and put on the back burner due to the obvious apocalyptic circumstances to deal with! This film is a staple of cinema and not just horror cinema and is a must see.In closing, David Emge's ""Flyboy"" has the best zombie walk of all time!",Dawn of the Dead

""Dawn of the Dead"" introduced me to horror/zombies and ever since, the Zombie genre of horror has been my favourite.I won't go into the plot in great detail; best to find out for yourself like I did. Sequel to ""Night of the Living Dead"", I have yet to see the original, (I have only seen the remake, after I seen DawnOTDead) It doesn't matter if you haven't seen NightOTLDead as it doesn't tie into DawnOTDead too much. Zombies take over world, survivors hide in mall, epic battles etc.But it isn't the plot which gripped me so much, it was the dark, intense atmosphere that this movie hands out throughout. Sure there are some humorous parts but other than that it was just legendary and introduced Zombie horror and would inspire many others to create their own films in years time.Made in 1978, the gore was still very good and made you churn at some parts (thumbs up). The character development was excellent and eventually you get to know and understand all of the characters.

As a Drama, or an Adventure where our protagonists trying to be Kings of the Mall, perhaps a Horror epic where humans brink of destruction clearly takes away our humanity that lowers us even below the Zombies. The undead are used as a tool to bring up what Romero wants to say. Only that is creative beyond all brilliance. Humans battles and arguments for fighting goes on while these creatures tries to be a part of the rich hierarchy. Sometimes we could bring some of the issues home to our reality and the underlying fears are powerful. The fact that this movie is very easy to ovaranalyze just makes it more interesting. The characters are mostly very memorable and all the wishes for them to survive trough the ordeal are there. The movies tone is also special and sarcastic but dealth with such a masterfully hand that knows what its doing. The line ""When there's no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the Earth"" was that great that it also was used to represent the Movies Tagline. Which is a wonderful touch i never seen before.

The difficult thing about this movie for me is its length. I found it being a very long film to digest. The pacing is slow for the MTV generation. The slow zombie humor was quite enjoyable.The other thing is the social commentary is something i don't think we see in horror movies very often. Watching the film you will get the message easy not something that you have to look hard for.The zombies in George Romero movies are not always my favorite. I found the two kids who were actually fast moving zombies confuse me why not all the the zombies not just run at their victims. I guess zombies just too lazy but maybe their not that hungry just jealous of the living. The makeup on the zombies made them look blue which I found something that made them look lame. You still get great special effects though throughout the film.The character development makes you really care for the characters. Caring for the victims in this movie made it special. I don't see that in horror movies very often. Most horror movies is all about gore, nudity, and jump scares. This one I think was all about the characters.Least favorite parts: slow pacing, blue zombies Favorite parts: The setting, story, everything that makes a good movieI give this film not a high rating because the remake is more enjoyable for me as a viewer.

349,judejensen,Most iconic zombie film of all-time,9,17 January 2019,"Awww, ""Dawn Of The Dead"", what an enjoyable film this is. I first saw this at a very young age, probably 8 or 9, and at that time it was the most violent thing I'd ever seen. I also thought it was long and boring, but now, I think it's one of the greatest horror movies ever made. The film follows radio-station employee Stephen, and his girlfriend, Francine, escape in the station helicopter, accompanied by two SWAT members, Roger and Pete. They fly to a nearby shopping mall, and decide to hold out there. The Shopping Mall setting allows a lot of comedic moments, but it's also social satire, comparing Mall shoppers to Zombies. They have everything they need in the mall and it works out for a while. Until, a gang of bikers, led by Tom Savini,(creator of all the special effects). You may also know Tom Savini as Sex Machine in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". The bikers trash the mall and open the doors for thousands of zombies to get it. The effects by Tom Savini are amazing, though its pretty tame for todays standards, back then...in 1978...you would've crapped your pants. The acting is amazing, and George Romero created the most iconic zombie film of all-time, though he would later top it with its sequel. ""Dawn Of The Dead"" is always exciting and it never gets old, and always remember- ""When There's No More Room In Hell, The Dead Will Walk The Earth.""",Dawn of the Dead
350,thehellhole,Dawn of the dumb,2,11 April 2008,"This is not a review. This is a warning. Before I start to slay, three things I have to say:1) Dawn of the Dead is a B-movie. Weapon grade BALONEY. 2) George A. Romero is a very, VERY BAD director. 3) Tom Savini is a cool dude.Dawn of the Dead (DOTD) is not a horror movie, it's not a comedy, well, in fact it's a big NOTHING! Why? I tell you why!CONCEPT/BASIC IDEA: The basic idea of this trash is quite good. A couple of people hide in a shopping mall to stay away from flesh eating zombies. The set-up is promising but the delivery is ridiculous. A good idea was wasted in the hands of a director who has no clue of what is good and what is bad. SCRIPT: Romeros 5 year old niece, who obviously wrote the script, is not very talented and a bit inexperienced. Romeros contribution made everything even worse. Dario Argento didn't read the script, he just pretended that he did. When it came to the Euro Cut, it was too late to make changes.ACTING: Half way into the movie I thought that I saw a zombie holding cue cards for the ""actors"". Think of Steven Segal or Jean Claude VanDamme trying to deliver a credible performance. It is not possible, because there is no acting talent. My theory is that between two takes the zombies ate certain parts of the actors brains which are needed to give a convincing performance. Romero should have noticed this but maybe he was too busy coloring some sexy blonde zombie boobs with red paint.MAKE UP/EFFECTS: Well made gore, guts and cut off limbs are crucial to a zombie movie. What do you do when you realize that you are short on money and everything looks like garbage? You make a satirical comedy that tries to reflect society with a biting edge! What do you do if you are George A. Romero? You produce an unfunny mush-mash without focus and fail miserably!MUSIC: Scary, suspenseful music is neglect-able, after all it is a comedy! Goblin used all the good ideas for Suspiria. You don't try too hard when you get paid 2 Dollars for a movie score. Romero realized that after he finished coloring the boobs and bought the cheapest synthesizer of 1978 to create some ambiance.THE ENDING (Spoilers): Big black man tells dumb blonde girl that he doesn't want to escape with her. He does not want to live so he prepares to commit suicide with the smallest gun in the entire movie (a model that evil ladies used to hide in their stockings). When the zombies finally arrive and attack him he suddenly changes his mind, climbs onto the roof, combats a couple of zombies like Bruce Lee on a bad day, and gets into the helicopter to fly away. That's it. That's the climatic ending.Seriously, I think that DOTD has become a ""classic"" because a lot of American people are in love with guns and shooting. The body-count is really high so this may satisfy some urges. If you want good horror that leaves you disturbed and speechless, look elsewhere. Luckily a friend of mine borrowed me this movie, so I didn't feel bad when I finished it. I was glad that I haven't bought it.The real brain-dead zombies are the people who give this film a high rating and call it ""one of the best horror movies ever made"".",Dawn of the Dead
351,RaajKhurana,A movie that has influenced and inspired a bunch of zombie films today.,8,1 July 2020,"Very good zombie movie and horror movie in general. Great gore effects and the black humor mixed with apocalyptic dread is great. Actors are also good, but I wish the characters themselves were a little more compelling. I felt like I didn't care about them as much as I did the characters from Night of the Living Dead. There are many, many zombie flicks out there, but, to my mind, this is one of the absolute best.",Dawn of the Dead
352,LtCol_Kilgore,"A brilliant, scary, social commentary ****/****",10,26 September 2001,"Dawn of the Dead- ****/****George A. Romero's masterful classic is least of anything a film about zombies. ""Dawn of the Dead"" is thinly disguised as a zombie gore flick, but it is really three things. 1. A cultural statement portraying racism, angst, counter-culture and degradation. 2. An account of human bonding and human reaction to different environments, harsh and eclectic. 3. Least of this trio, it is a black comedy. Rather, it contains dark comedic elements. Somewhere early along in the film, I looked past the initial plot of four strangers hiding in a mall from hordes of zombies swarming the world, as the government attempts to find a solution to the chaotic massacres. Peter Washington (Ken Foree) is the strong, black, courageous SWAT team member who rises above the other three protagonists to become their leader. Steven Andrews (David Emge) is the  somewhat timid and hesitant traffic reporter, lover of the pregnant Francine (Gaylen Ross). Ostensibly hapless and useless, Francine is actually a valuable aide to the quartet. Last, is the resourceful and daring Roger (Scott H. Reiniger).From where I left off, I overlooked the premise of the quartet defending themselves from hordes of flesh-eating monsters and instead saw thoroughly fleshed out character personalities, bonds, and interactions. Throughout the movie's length, we learn to genuinely love these guys; Roger is so smooth and fun, easily likeable, Peter is quiet, warm-spirited, and reliable, Steven and Francine are charming. We knows them like our friends and heroes, so when they are attacked by the ferocious zombies, the suspense is so nerve-wracking and our hearts beat so rapidly because we really care about the four protagonists and could not bear to watch them die. They started off as strangers and parted as companions. Also, it is very interesting to watch how they monopolized the mall, how, in the beginning, they slept on cold hallway floors, constantly keeping watch. Later, they eliminated the threat, dined in the mall's fancy restaurant, ice skated on the mall's link, visited the gun shop for weapons, slept in rooms with beds, dressers, televisions, and other luxuries. This is an accurate representation of how it is human nature to manipulate and survive through alien atmospheres. I found that vision ingenious. Another brilliant message the film brings attention to regards the 1970-decade. I found that like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Dawn of the Dead"" captures the spirit of its era. The racism, tumult, riots, counter-culture, degradation are all well represented here. The film shows SWAT teams, complete with racist officers, who kill for fun, raiding an unruly group of Hispanics and Blacks, hillbillies heading out in troops to battle zombies for sport, mercenaries and vigilantes running wild, all events indistinguishable from incidents in the 70's. Perhaps the most disturbing and ironic ""70's incident"" in the movie involves raiding gangs of bikers who explode into the mall, mirthfully slaughtering zombies (not that that is an offense) and vandalizing stores, stealing jewelry, guns, clothes, and everything they can find; whereas our heroes took only their necessities. What happens next is very scathingly satirical and ironic. In between the battle for the survival of the human species, the bikers find it necessary to start their own little civil war amongst the not-so-numerous survivors. They hunt down both zombies and our good guys; a perfectly timed paradoxical and cynical scene. Just like the battles between non-conformists and conventionalists during the 1970's and 1960's, when America was on the brink of disaster, this cinematic revolution is hard-hitting, gut wrenching, and very real. One fascinating facet of the movie is how the audience learns to disregard the now ""minor"" threat of the slow-moving zombies (a bullet or incision to the head will do the job). At this point, one would not even notice that this film had the slightest relevance to the horror genre. Instead, we fear the vicious bikers, a bigger threat, villains with swords and guns. This time, the suspense and uneasiness detonates, for there is a much greater chance of death for the heroes. I found the scariest part of the movie was the deterioration of the planet during the zombie apocalypse; how the human species' decline is morbidly presented effectively and expertly by George A. Romano. However, a refreshing sense of black humor is tossed in towards the middle of the film. Zombies attempt to walk up escalators, ice skate, and explore their surroundings, with chuckles as the result of their clumsiness. One biting laugh comes when Steven explains to Francine why all these creatures have returned to the mall.  ""Instinct, memory. This was an important place in their lives,"" he points out. And of course, there are many, many thrills and chills. This film isn't very ""jump-out-from-the dark-with-a-chainsaw"" scary, but more disturbing and extremely tense, because we actually care about our characters and don't want them to die. The movie is unpredictable in this aspect, unlike slashers where you are guessing who the one survivor is and how the others die. As the zombies close in, we plead, ""Don't die, don't die!"" I have two minor complaints with this film. My biggest one is that the movie seems to carry on forever, the way ""Goodfellas"" did. Despite the brilliance I felt enraptured with, I kept asking myself, ""When will this movie end?!?"" However, I realize that Romano could not have trimmed any more scenes  without damaging the potency of his work. Also, the gore was at times just too much. For instance, the exploding head scene was revolting, and most of all, the intestinal feeding scene when a biker is torn apart was repulsive; I couldn't watch as his guts were graphically shown ripping apart.Aside from those two unfortunate aspects, I strongly encourage you, rather you HAVE to, watch ""Dawn of the Dead."" Thrilling and suspenseful thanks to extremely distinct characters, whose fate you hope a happy one, and grippingly socially relevant, this is a unique horror, or really of all genres, treasure.",Dawn of the Dead

So a group decide to lay low in a shopping centre and all hell breaks loose.The gore by Savini is awesome and it has some of the best death scenes ever. Even the legendary director Dario Argento produced it.I have still yet to see a Dario film but if this is anything to go by then I'll be in for a treat. You need to watch this.,Dawn of the Dead

Hmm...I jumped really only once during the movie (understand I didn't see it in the 70's) I'm sure this was very shocking in the 70's as there is A LOT of gore, especially near the end.But to me this isn't really a horror movie as it is a brilliant story. It's harder to get immersed in any ""visual effects"" because now the zombies might look plain cheesy. But as one reviewer pointed out it's George A. Romero's take on Louis XVI, keep the starving masses at bay (looking the doors to the mall, blocking the parking lot with semi-trucks) while indulge in royalties (All the stores to themselves, they can help themselves to anything they want). The story is just brilliant, I wish Ideas like this still came out in hollywood, the fact of four strangers living in a shopping mall while the outside world collapses is very immersing. The characters are well to uneavenly developed (the swat people beng the most developed) but it works. I didn't feel a world of sad when a character would die, but still it works. There are lot of underlying themes here, the most obvious being the zombies walking around the mall. Another one I noticed was mans agressive nature, during the whole attack on the mall scene (the goriest sequence in the film).

I clicked into IMDb.com, and saw that it had a 7.7 rating. But unfortunately it wasn't worthy of its rating. I can not believe that anyone would rank this movie higher than maximum 4. It was supposed to be a horror movie, but where was the horror? I only need three words to describe this piece of crap; silly, predictable and funny. These things should not occur in a horror movie, but here they do, and this ruins the movie. The acting is so bad, that I would gladly watch a Steven Seagal movie after watching this. The zombies were so idiotic, and not scary at all. The dialogue was even worse, though there are a FEW good quotes. The special effects are the only really good thing about this movie, because they are quite good. But sadly this doesn't save the movie.A horror movie without horror has failed, and this sure does. 3/10",Dawn of the Dead
359,rjh2200,Attack of the Blue War-paint Tribe,7,13 July 2005,"Dawn of the Dead is usually hailed as the finest of the Zombie films, and for solid reasons - the acting is decent, the premise is good, and there is a genuine creepy feel that gives you chills. People usually hold it as a classic social commentary on consumer culture, but I don't really buy into this explanation so much as it being just a horror film that happens to take place in a shopping mall.Given when this movie was made and what was likely a relatively modest budget, the film comes off as artistically sound. There are some cheese-fest gore scenes (blood is BRIGHT red) but they still pale in comparison to what you see in a lot of these other types of movies. At first, I hated the music and figured they bought out some local kids' crappy garage band out of cheapness. I realized later that since their sound is like that of muzak, it adds to the ambiance of the movie. The best part is surely the camera work with its scenes of zombies doing mundane things in a shopping mall like walking on an ice rink or riding on an escalator. Rather than reveling in their undead-ness and showing their nasty fangs, this film looks at their humanity more. I like best the few scenes where the living and the undead make extended eye contact because the emotion comes out more when the zombies appear harmless (example: francine staring down a ball player zombie behind a glass door).This film picks up, following Night of the Living Dead, with the collapse of human society and the emergence of small groups of random survivors. One such group is composed of two lovebird news reporters (Stephen and Francine) and two police-types (Peter and Roger). They flee in the weather helicopter and discover an abandoned mall. The remainder of the movie deals with their subjugation of the zombies within the mall and their struggles to survive there as the world around them steadily devolves. On par with most other zombie movies, we learn about the outside world only through discrete blips on the radio or TV screen. Eventually, all media goes blank and the world is evidently run by greasy motorcycle pirates. A group of said pirates attacks the survivors at the mall, thus setting off this long film's climax with Stephen's death (Roger had already got the heave-ho when he was bitten by a zombie and eventually ""turned"").The purported purpose of this movie is nicely expressed in the pirates themselves - the humans are more horrific than the zombies. They embody the worst in human nature. They're stupid - when they storm the mall, they go straight for the bank and collect dollar bills like that currency matters. They're sadistic and greedy. But though we are supposed to draw a contrast between them and the four main characters whose perspective dominates the movie, we see those four enjoying life shut up in the mall with jewelry and fine dinners as though nothing were happening in the outside world, so they become callous in their own right. After all, it was Stephen who shot at them first because, ""it's (the mall) ours."" This may be too much thought, but this really is the brainiest movie in a genre known for its corniness. I've always wondered how they have electricity and running water even after weeks and weeks in the mall when ostensibly nobody's left to manage utilities plants. The zombies themselves are pretty silly-looking - ""let's just slap some blue paint on their face and tell them to slowly stumble around. It'll look pretty good!"" The random assortment of zombies never fails to delight, however (my favorite is the hari krishna zombie).",Dawn of the Dead

My favorite scene is the one where the 3 male characters of the film get into a car meant to be displayed in the mall and race to both ends of the mall in order to close the main doors, therefore, not allowing zombies to enter.

The scenes were really open-minded, no fear to show cutting human (human or zombie, just a matter of make-up there)heads or shooting as far as it reloads. But, please...was it meant to be a comedy? Whoever could think out an idea about living death, but this is supposed to be a movie that ought to attract eager-for-horror audience. Was it successful? Hardly! By the way, where did they take the main protagonists from? Because,for instance, the black one (I already forgot his name)could not convince me at all. And his voice...did you hear it?It was stony! Was he really so much cold-blood or he played main shots as if he revised the screenplay in his dressing room? Well, the blood looked like a cheap water-ketchup punch, it's hard to make convincing scenes setting off such a punch every minute. People in that period of time did not know what's the color of blood? As far as I know, the color of blood doesn't change, which means these people immediately knew they were watching some dinner-breaking disgust which was ridiculous at the same time.

365,zombking,"Not Just a Cult, but a True Classic",10,23 May 2003,"Following up on his low-budget smash hit from 1968, Night of The Living Dead, Romero decided to make Dawn of the Dead.  Little did he know that he would change the course of horror movie history, starting a long string of spinoffs, rip-offs, and semi-sequels.1978, just one of those years where supposedly everyone danced disco and smoked pot (although survivors of the era know otherwise).  George Romero films a medium budget, mainly independant movie that takes the film world by storm.  Dawn of the Dead is the story about four people who, during an era where zombies walk the earth, lock themselves up in an abandoned shopping mall to survive and try to live somewhat normal lives.This is eaiser said than done however, because soon a bunch of outlaws ruins the perfect lives and loots the mall, allowing zombies in.That is the basic story of Dawn of the Dead, so at this point you may be wondering what makes up the rest of the movie. There are two ways to look at this: literally and philisophically.Literally, the movie starts out explaining the charicters backgrounds, strengths, and weaknessess.  Through an exciting scene in an apartment complex, we find out that this is not your parents movie, as in it uses violence to make a definite point.When our charicters are united in the mall, each of them has issues to deal with and work out, but those ideas are pushed out of the way when they have to lock up the exits to the mall, one by one, while avoiding zombie attacks (a constant theme thoughout the film, oddly enough)When all of the zombies around are killed, the group of looters allows in all of the zombies in the mall, and many of the looters are killed slowly, painfully, and very graphically.  The violence throughout the film is remarkably high, and for good reason.  The ending has some of the charicters killed and some escaping from their doom only to see if they would survive another day.Philisophically speaking, though, the movie goes deeper than that.  Not only does the film follow the charicters, but the rest of the United States to well.  It raises a huge ""what if..."" question that could only be answered though Romero.  The charicters represent a viewer from outside, looking in to the world as it destroys itself because it cannot deal with the stress or different ways of life with the zombies.  They watch this all on televeision till it happens to them though the looters.  This would be society finally destroying itself.  Some escape, to find that they may perhaps may have to save the human race.Should this be taken Literally or Philisophically?  Your choice, thats what makes the movie great.  Do you like horror or deep thinking?  Perhaps watch the movie twice or more, from differenct perspectives every time.  The point is that this is one of the greats and a must see for all times.",Dawn of the Dead

On the whole the zombie effects were a little disappointing but you can't really expect all the zombies to look good, there must have been about 200 of them! When the zombie effect was fully applied (like when Stephen becomes zombie-fied) the talents of Tom Savini are obvious.Behind all of the mindless blowing-off-tops-of-heads action there lurk some serious messages about the way people treat each other and how commercial the world is becoming. You really feel that Romero's view of the world is not far from reality.Downsides of the film include the running time, after the first hour and a half I was beginning to tire of all the zombie splattering and the ending was a little odd but who cares when the rest of the film is so good?So, If you get a chance, watch this film (along with Night of the Living Dead and Day of the Dead)",Dawn of the Dead

Coupled with amazing shots, they deliver the weight (or levity) they were supposed to. Plus they have that retro sound, you know from when synthetizers weren't in every household pc.The actors are awesome, if a bit exaggerating at times, but that has a comical or dramatic value. The characters are well formed, and you can build up your sympathy with them over the course of the film.It's full of action, but there are relief-filled moments, where the much sought-after security seems to be achieved. Somehow the mood conveys, that it is not meant to last. Zombies are slow, but that creepiness can be even more frightening than if they were running at you.It's not just the action, but rather the sheer ingenuity and ideas that make this movie great (along the criticism of society).

374,jstreeter3163,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,1,24 May 2020,"When I set out to watch this movie, I had high expectations. I've heard many positive things about this film, and I was told it was a more intelligent, slow-paced, character-driven version of the 2004 remake. I heard the practical effects were great and the movie more disturbing and eerie than many other zombie films.Well, in short, I think everyone is suffering from some sort of mass delusion. I can't wrap my head around it. I have seen a fair share of movies, especially horrors, and it's rare for me to hate a film. But I truly hated this one.Let's start out with the zombies: first, the practical effects were awful. All zombies had a greyish-blue face paint (even if they died 5 seconds ago), and it looked incredibly fake and cheap. The actors who portrayed them were terrible, they had very obvious human expressions on their face and didn't seem remotely undead-esque. Worst of all, the zombies were completely unthreatening. There were multiple scenes where a character was surrounded by them, but all it took to escape was a couple quick pushes or slaps to escape without so much as a scratch. Some zombies would die from getting a mallot to the chest. There was absolutely no sense of dread or threat and as such, the scare factor was literally zero.The acting in general was really, really bad. Ken Foree was the only actor who I enjoyed, but his performance was nowhere near to make up for the rest. The actor who portrayed the other policeman, Roger, was unbearably awful from start to finish, and every on-screen moment with him was cringey and nonsensical.The plot was a convuluted mess. Even though it was a rather simple story, it's executed so poorly that it's hard to know what the hell is going on half the time. There are so many stupid moments in this film it made my head hurt.It's unclear why any of the characters in this film do what they do. For instance, when the bikers come to raid the mall, why do the two main characters sit around with a gun and watch them for 30 minutes, if they never intended to have a shootout in the first place? Why didn't they just leave? And why, just why, did that one biker check his blood pressure while surrounded by zombies? Why did Ken Foree's character randomly decide to kill himself at the end without ever once having given a previous hint or foreshadowing that he was sick of fighting?Too many stupid moments like this, along with the general confusing and inane plot, the terribly unscary and unconvincing zombies, and the bad acting made this film highly unenjoyable. Sincerely it was one of the worst films I've ever seen.While I do think Night of the Living Dead is excellent, in retrospect I've come to realize that Romero is probably a hack, which is evident by his recent string of movies which are pure garbage, as well as Day of the Dead which is similarly awful to this film.",Dawn of the Dead

I was 16 when I saw it in the theater in 1979 and I had to close my eyes at some scenes. I have seen a number of other Zombie movies, including the 2004 version of Dawn of the Dead. Many of them have been scary, but this movie is a lot more than just scary. This is the classic zombie movie that all others since have tried to emulate.The subtle thing that makes this movie so fantastic is the editing.

Romero obviously wanted to send out another message on the ideas of humans and consumerism. However this message would've been strong enough, but romero insisted on the characters saying this several times throughout. The scenes of the characters shopping while the whole world was fighting for survival was another message of the human condition.You always knew who was winning the battle. This was not explicit, but it was shown when the radio and television broadcasts disappeared nearer the end of the film. I was also kept guessing as to the ending of the film. Were there going to be any survivors? The ending again in my mind was very similar to 'invasion of the body snatchers'. An open ending, it gave the feeling that the world truly was overrun, and nowhere else to go.There was some decent gore, a nice scene of a biker getting held down while zombies ripped his stomach open and ate his intestines (real pig's intestines used).

Still watch at least onve or twive a year. All aspects of this film were great. Romero and Savini are the GODZ of undead horror. George, wherever you are... thank you. You also Mr. Savini",Dawn of the Dead
379,Giovanni_Corleone,Simply Amazing,9,15 February 2006,"This movie is simply awesome. Directed by George A. Romero, the zombie apocalypse has continued and society is crumbling. Humans are almost as dangerous as the zombies eating them. In the opening scene, a SWAT team raids an apartment building full of people who won't let their dead be properly destroyed. One member of the team goes on a racist killing spree, and violence ensues. Two members, Stephen and Peter get tired of their job and decide to desert. They meet up with their friend Francine and her wimpy boyfriend Roger, or Flyboy, who flies them in a news helicopter to a nearby mall. And by the way, Peter is by far one of the coolest characters ever. He can do anything from hot-wire a car to performing backstreet abortions. This is easily one of my favourite movies. I have spent hours thinking of what I would do in such a situation, so when the zombie invasion does come I'll be ready. The great thing about Dawn of the Dead is that it's extremely entertaining and also a strong social satire.What kind of a world do we live in where even after we die, we feel compelled to go to the mall? Seeing the zombified corpses wander around the mall would actually look like normal life if it weren't for all the blood all over them. Another point this movie hits upon is materialism. At first the main characters only go to the mall for survival and essentials, but they slowly get sucked into a completely materialistic world to the point where they defend it to the death. Kind of the same message as The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (Movie of the Week 34). Also, in the midst of all this turmoil, politicians still talk and bicker, but do absolutely nothing to actually solve the problem, a point brought up in Life of Brian (Movie of the Week 23). The list goes on and on. As an awesome bonus, Romero finally got to work with make-up and special effects artist Tom Savini. He was supposed to do this with Night of the Living Dead as well, by Savini got called up for Vietnam. See this movie. You will not be disappointed.",Dawn of the Dead

For the world to be taken over by flesh eating zombies, and having to live in a shopping mall where everything literally is at your fingertips. Unfortunately the real gory parts of the film are only on the The Directors Cut which has recently come out in the UK.  Until then the film was pretty mild.  At least the UK's version of it was. My only complaint about the film is the soundtrack.  It's horrible.",Dawn of the Dead
381,semprini-2,The best zombie film ever made,10,30 October 1999,"This is a hugely enjoyable film.  It brilliantly captures the apocalyptic desperation that zombie films strive for by centring on the exploits of four people who seek refuge from the horrors around them in a shopping mall.Most horror films follow a straight line once the horror begins, only stopping when it reaches a climax at the end.  However, this film is intriguing as the survivors struggle, momentarily enjoy success then find that the situation really is beyond their control.Not really scary, this is still a masterpiece.  Not just the best zombie film ever made, but possibly the most enjoyable film I have seen.",Dawn of the Dead
382,keith7198,A huge Disappointment !!!!!!!!!!!,4,19 August 2006,"As a huge 'Night of the Living Dead' fan, you can imagine my elation at seeing 'Dawn of the Dead'. Sadly, my excitement soon turned to absolute frustration. What could have been a great sequel to possibly the best horror movie of all time, turns out to be a mindless, silly, borderline preposterous 2 hours and 15 minutes on film.The movie begins without much of a beginning. You feel as if you are joining a movie about half way into it. You kinda piece together what has happened and even that is terribly vague. Then there are the four main characters, none of which are a bit appealing or even slightly interesting.The acting is plain bad and sometimes you will find yourself shaking your head at the cast's tendencies to over act and completely ruin a scene. The musical score is annoying and sometimes completely out of sync with the scenes being presented. The story is full of holes and drags on to the point of boredom. The silly inclusion of the rogue biker gang and their impact on the story is just terrible.The special effects are pretty good, especially for 1978 except for the fact that once a person is transformed to a ""living dead"", their face suddenly looks as though blue powder has been patted all over it.Like I said, the movie is 2 hours and 15 minutes long...waaaaay to long. With such small amount of character development or opening story setting, this film could have easily be 1 hour and 30 minutes. I found myself checking the clock out on numerous occasions.There are some instances that are entertaining and actually pretty funny. Watching zombies try to adjust to escalators, bubbling fountains, and an ice rink surface is worth a good laugh. Not quite as funny as some of the hideous overacting, but still funny.Again, the potential was here for a great movie and as a ""Night"" fan I had high expectations. But even after watching it again and again, I simply can't see a reason to change my perspective. There are just to many flaws, absurdities, and annoyances to make this movie worth recommending. And I wanted to like it so bad!",Dawn of the Dead
383,janemason100,best Zombie film ever!,10,14 October 2006,"I love this movie!! this is one of the best, if not THE best horror film that ever was made from the day I am writing this to the day I die. Some people may say that I am over reacting but I do not think so. The initial idea of the film is one of the best because even though the film is based in a shopping mall they are still isolated from the outside world because of the fact there may not be any help arriving and there are flesh eating zombies trying to chow down upon them. Aside from this fact I still believe that this film is one of the best horror films ever made much better than the remake(Which was good but cannot compare to this awesome film)I also like the way the four lead characters conduct themselves within the movie. For Example,there are Flesh eating hordes after them and they still remain true to not only surviving but with dignity(They look after each other and do not kill each other only if one of them turns into a zombie)However, I still believe the chemistry between the characters is so believable it seems that they have known each other longer than when all first meet each other. IN the film you can see that the actors are obviously enjoying themselves(I know I would if I had an abandoned shopping mall to myself)Director George.A.Romero really captures the actor's individual personalities within the film because the character's are so believable within the film that I believe if a zombie plague does occur I would want the two POlice officers protecting me from the flesh eating undead. In conclusion I believe that this film is a must for any D.V.D collection it comes highly recommended from me and i believe that millions of people around the world will agree with me.",Dawn of the Dead
384,kavalhh,Grand Story Plot But No Physical Attraction,4,27 August 2001,"The big problem with this film is the insufficient make-up for the zombies & their much too humanlike movements. These two major factors make them look way too fake, too human & not scary in appearance (though one or two of them have adequate latices on their face to make them look quite scary visually). ""Looks"" are important in this kind of film or else it's just simply another low-grade, cheap horror flick. Heheh!Many of my friends watched this movie on DVD & no one of them like it even a bit!

Dawn of the Dead is one of the few horror films that is a semi-sequel and is clearly better than the first outing. Now I am not saying Night is garbage, it is far from it, but Dawn is a masterpiece of horror cinema, and after almost 30 years it still appeals to the mass horror audience, and still manages to hook in new fans at every viewing.The film delivers some of the best character development in horror cinema while making your mind constantly move with questions about a what if scenario.

Four people (Two SWAT team members and a husband & wife) barricade themselves in a Philadelphia shopping mall during a zombie uprising. Horror and suspense ensues.  Tom Savini's makeup effects are used very well here to convey a sense of dread.  True, the gore is plentiful, but it makes a point; that consumers are zombies. This chilling vision is well conceived by horror maestro George A. Romero and provides the viewer an experience he/she will never forget.Rating: 10/10",Dawn of the Dead
390,jonathan_ley,"Perhaps the greatest film ever made, certainly the greatest zombie film ever made!",10,10 May 2005,"Dawn of the Dead is a bona fide, cast iron classic. Forget the remakes and the cash ins (good to see someone has stumped up the cash for Romero to make Land of the Dead rather than pay-rolling every Hollywood hack, McG wannabe to rip off the master) - this is the original and the best. From the beginning, starting off in a TV station in a state of chaos, the film never lets up. It skilfully expands upon the situation that first emerged in Night of the Living Dead, cranking it up to the max. Zombies are running amok, killing and eating the living. The killed stand right back up and become zombies. The odds are already stacked against humanity and the film acknowledges this by taking the brilliant decision to follow a group of survivors trying to flee the situation. This isn't a film about coming up with the big solution to the problem, this is a film about trying to stay alive. A masterful social satire, black comedy and balls out horror film Dawn of the Dead has it all. What's truly great about this film is the way it isn't afraid to suddenly shift gears and change tone. We're fleeing with our heroes in a helicopter. Hey, lets suddenly drop in on a bunch of rednecks having a great old time using the zombies for target practise. That was fun wasn't it. Oh wait, here come some terrifying zombie kids. Scared again? Romero keeps bouncing us around, perfectly in control of his material and yet happy to let it break loose once in a while. Spontanteous custard pie fight in the middle of a pitched battle between zombies and bikers? Yeah, go on then. Dawn of the Dead doesn't skimp on the gore but it's also got the smarts to back it up. Like the other entries in the Dead trilogy (and hopefully in Land too) there is a rich vein of satirical social commentary running through the film. See those zombies wandering aimlessly around the mall? They're us they are. Whilst I love and admire the truly nihilistic ending to Night of the Living Dead (surely the bleakest ending to a film since Clouzot's Wages of Fear) Romero does right by his heroes and gives them an escape, a chance to run and try and stay alive some more. Why do I keep calling them heroes? They're flawed, selfish, stupid, honourable and brave. Guess they're us too. When there's no more room in Hell the dead will walk the Earth (undoubtedly THE greatest tag line in the history of film). It seems now that when there's no more room in development Hell brainless Hollywood execs will remake every film ever made. Give them a miss and check out the original. It will haunt you forever.",Dawn of the Dead
391,Zombeefan,Outstanding 1970's Zombie Horror Film,9,13 May 2010,"RECIPE...Take the man who directed Night of the Living Dead, mix in an Italian splatter producer, throw in a witty and social comment filled screenplay and you get a great zombie horror flick that not only keeps the horror element at the top of the mix, but also entertains the audience through and through.If you're a zombie horror fan, and you don't know who George A. Romero is then you should seriously stop watching horror films, or at least Zombie Horror.Romero has made a career of scaring audiences to death with visceral visuals and gore soaked scenarios for the better part of 40 years but the pinnacle of his career is DAWN of the DEAD, a film celebrated by million of zombie and horror fans around the globe.The sheer amount of scope and depth built into this film is not only engrossing, but superbly executed for its minuscule budget. Romero manages to give us characters we actually care about and drop them into a horrific situation in which they try to make the best of it, then sprinkles a bit of social commentary into the mix to make you think.Holding up inside a mall during a zombie apocalypse seems like a great idea, the flash and pizazz of having everything you can ever imagine is mind blowing, but Romero is sly, he progresses these events by actually telling the audience two things... Consumerism was overtaking society, and Money or Material items can't make you happy. You can have everything, but you really can't because as the story moves along our characters start to feel like they are in a prison, trapped and consumed by their own greed and it is only the events associated with a collapse in society such as looters to shake things up and get them to realize that not every place is safe and you don't need everything under the sun to be happy and content. Some times just surviving is all you really need.In the end you have a classic film which delivers the visceral goods and an engaging story. Kudos to the man who brought us Night of the Living Dead by bringing us a follow every as bit as good as his initial offering to modern zombie cinema.",Dawn of the Dead

393,danesmith-1,The Greatest of All,9,27 June 2005,Dawn of the Dead was the first of the four Romero classics I saw. The only reason I thought of seeing it was because of the remake which I was disappointed in. I'm glad I saw it because it then this Romero series became my favorite. Dawn was as believable as Night of the Living Dead and was as bizarre. Even today the gore beats a lot of the films today. Even the remake. Maybe the comic book like surroundings or the dream people have of living in a mall but it is the best of the first three (Didn't see Land yet) Tom Savini was a genius in the special effects and Romero was the genius writer and director. What made me give it a nine was the ending. It wasn't a sad ending as the original but I think I know why. In Night you related to some of the people but you didn't really like the people that much. In Dawn the people had jobs you might not relate to but these people were good nice people who didn't do anything wrong and these people grew on you and you wanted to see them get out OK instead of suffer the fate of the people from last time.,Dawn of the Dead

403,jenkins-stewart,"Zombie Shakespeare, quite!",10,14 December 2007,"Simply put, the greatest horror film ever made, and one of the greatest films ever made period! A class act all around, even at its goriest. I don't wish to spoil anything for you by dodging around the plot or any of the wonderful things you can get out of this film, and will continue to get from repeated viewings. It is an aesthetic triumph which has no equal: one of the most filmic, and delightful productions ever made. Like all great works of art, it is the apex of its genre as well as transcendent of its genre. Do not read the back-of-the-case blurb, do not read semi-critical reviews you must watch this film and decide for yourself. A short premise is all you need: The dead roam the earth, killing those they find. Those they kill get up and kill. It is the end of the world. We're down to the line. 4 people try to survive by fighting with the ghouls for control of large mall which could perhaps sustain them indefinitely and protect them from the hungry, but mindless hordes of flesh eating zombies shambling in the parking lot if they can contend with those already inside! Will humanity survive though death reigns? Are the greater threats outside, or inside? There are 3 great horror and sci-fi trilogies in film. One is Star-Wars, one is Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, and the greatest is Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead. Dawn of the Dead is the most well rounded and exceptional of the trilogy. Dawn of The Dead is about race. Dawn of The Dead is about class. Dawn of The Dead is about America. Dawn of The Dead is about death. Dawn of The Dead is about life. Dawn of The Dead is about consumerism. Dawn of The Dead is about humanity. Dawn of The Dead is about violence. Dawn of The Dead is about domesticity. Dawn of The Dead is about individuals. Dawn of The Dead is about society. Dawn of The Dead is funny. Dawn of The Dead is brutally serious. Dawn of The Dead is about great film making, made by the combined effort of a dedicated and revolutionary team with the power to take the taboo and make it golden. Even on a purely superficial level, these effects are brilliant, filmic, and artisticmuch more so than anything cgi (though still light years behind the effects used in Day of The Dead.) Like a Shakespearean play, Dawn of the Dead has something for the aristocrats, middle-class, and groundlings, and in that, it proves that we all share a common experience. It is just that magnificent. Some people will call this ""satire,"" and others ""camp,"" but really there's so much more to it! I encourage you to watch this movie repeatedly, because I know you'll get something different from it each time!Warning: Do not watch this film if you 1. have strong predispositions against gore, 2. strongly dislike parables or satires 3. cannot abide movies from the 70's. Warning: If you do not meet any of the qualifications above, then you cannot afford to miss this film! ((A perfect 100%. One of those rare and precious jewels. A unique and fitting work of art, both perfect for its time and timeless. When this film premiered the audience was chanting in the street. If you have even one romantic bone if your body, you will LOVE Dawn of The Dead.))",Dawn of the Dead
404,demolition-him,Way too overrated !!!!,4,12 October 2011,"First off, right of the bat I would like to mention that I am not an American so I didn't follow the ""supposed social commentary"" of this Original Dawn of the Dead. Secondly, I watched this movie along with Dawn of the Dead remake back to back.I am sorry to say that I do not agree with so many voters & lovers of this movie who prefer old one to new one. This old Dawn of the Dead is not even in the same ball-park in terms of acting, story, pacing, cinematography, make-up, gore, suspense, action or chilling horror when compared to the 2004 remake. Slow moving Zombies, stupid characters, bad make up & special effects. It just made me think ""Are Americans so God-damn stupid that they can't even lie low & kill of these slow moving Zombies one by one?"" I don't think so. An average American is much smarter than this, I am sure about it. In fact, it looks implausible that slow moving zombies like that took over & spread everywhere. If the characters are so dumb, they deserve to be devoured. By contrast its predecessor Night of the Living Dead was so much better & realistic. I guess many fans of this movie like it because they saw it first long time ago when they were children & hence a sentimental attachment. Since, I saw both original & remake back to back I had no sentiments attached & made up my mind purely on what scared me more.Although, portrayal that if Dead actually rises they will move stiff & slow is correct (ala Rigor-mortis) but George Romero never actually gave us the reason behind why the dead rose in the first place. Sorry, I don't buy into this BS that when there is no more room in hell the dead will walk the earth. Yes, not giving the reason or explaining everything makes you keep thinking later on but come on this no Ringu. Also, the fact that slow moving mindless zombies were able to take over America just like that where you have so strong military personnel & hell even a common American carries weapon, is way too exaggerated. In contrast, new Dawn of the Dead gives a brief montage in the beginning explaining the reason to be virus plague. Now virus can effect in many ways including morphing living beings into something which resembles undead. In short, I am cool with fast moving zombies & quite honestly they are freaking scary. New one has its own faults but it is vastly superior to this one. Another nagging question to all Romero fans, they keep talking about social commentary. In this case so called consumerism. What consumerism? Is going to mall to shop & buy stuff you need & want is consumerism. What does Romero himself does? Grow his own food, weave his own clothes?? It is not social commentary, it is BS in my opinion. My recommendation do watch it once at least but definitely watch 2004 version. I am giving it a 4 out of 10 merely because, It was made in late 70's & hence a lot of things said above like bad make-up or action sequence is mainly due to budget constraints & available technology at that time. Although in my humble opinion, after seeing so high rating new casual horror movive fans will raise expectations & will be sorely disappointed.",Dawn of the Dead
405,TheGreatAmericanNightmare,So Bad It's Good,7,4 August 2013,"Mild Spoilers I begrudgingly give this a grade of seven just because of what this movie represents to the genre. There are far, far better movies I have rated as sevens but it is what it is.How anybody can call this the greatest horror movie ever is beyond me. Yes, it is at the roots of a genre but it is still a 'B' movie, sometimes with worse dialog than 1968's 'Night of The Living Dead.' Hell, 'Night' was better in several ways, but I'm not going to go deep with this review.The first act is by far the worst, with bad camera work, bad writing and even worse dialog.Once the survivors settle into the shopping mall it becomes a different movie and is actually pretty enjoyable. The dialog is better, their behavior is logical and planned out, and you get to connect with them a little bit.Near the end when the raiders show up it gets stupid again, but by then you know it's over and you don't care. All in all you just have to relax, realize that it is a product of 70's bad movie making and let it take you away. It is cinema history and genre setting, so watch it for what it is and enjoy the ride.",Dawn of the Dead

The acting is good and there are some gruesome parts that are classic, but then there are some events that yet again ruin the message.  The question are these people retarded or something pops up constantly and i cant figure out an answer other than Romero must have gotten drunk so if anybody knows why then tell me.  This may upset a few of u but the new dawn of the dead is the real dawn of the dead, and the first was just a prototype.  My other gripe about this movie is all the unnecessary politics George thought he should add.  OK seriously what is up with just throwing out the political messages and not putting it in a way that makes sense.  I am not saying that the certain subjects in the movie should have been done tactfully, but it was just sorta thrown out there so hard that it seemed pointless.",Dawn of the Dead
408,raiquerlt1,Best horror movie ever,10,29 October 2012,"There's no much to say about this movie that wasn't said before. This is one of the hilarious, horrifying and goriest movies of all time. George A. Romero brought us a masterpiece of black humor and violence, also with a very interesting and relevant critic content. Dawn of the Dead isn't just a horror movie. Dawn... is an acid, pungent and veracious social critic about alienation, consumerism and lacks of communication. OK, there are some continuity errors and also the acting is not so good, but that's doesn't bother so much when you have such a genius screenplay and a brilliant direction like in Dawn of the Dead. A horror movie that have so much to say. Groundbreaking and unique!",Dawn of the Dead
409,dascottishterrier,A True Horror Classic,9,12 March 2005,"Romero's Dawn of the dead is a classic in every sense of the word. It's aged, but so what. When a zombie takes a bit out of someone it looks like they are really having a bite taken out of them, complete with ripping flesh. You can't really ask for more.Writing this in 2005 I feel obliged to compare it to the remake and while I prefer the remake that is because I'm from 2005 and therefore the remake is more likely to appeal to me. That said, I gave both films 9/10.It's truly a compliment to this film that it can still scare after 27 years. While other 'classic' horror films, like The Exorcist, aren't scary in modern times, DOTD still makes you jump. I'm not dissing the Exorcist, I can see how it could be scary, I just didn't find it scary.In conclusion this is a true horror classic and if you like horror films see this. If you've only seen the remake, this ain't better but it certainly ain't worse either. If you already have seen it, see it again. 9/10",Dawn of the Dead

411,Wulfus,"Yes Mister Romero, I see the Message now...",10,23 January 2006,"This is my second favorite movie, my favorite being FIGHT CLUB. This is the greatest horror movie ever made, simply put. It has everything. Violence, Romance, Character and Plot. BUT. If you want to see the real message of Anti-Consumerism, I suggest you watch the Extended Version, if you have the 4-disc set, or if you can find the extended DVD (hard to find). The movie teaches us the lesson that it is not good for our souls to be hypnotized by the pretty colors of the machine's neon lights and buy everything we don't need when we go out to the mall. If we do, we end up destroying it all, ourselves, each other and eventually, civilization. This is what the biker invasion represents, the Lord Giveth and the Lord can Taketh away. Like THAT. But other than the message, the movie is just plain fun. You got zombies dying left and right, you got blood flying out of nowhere and there's guts spilling into next week! So, enjoy the blood and guts, but be sure to understand the message of the movie as well. And if you really want to know it, watch the extended version. That's how I started to began to understand. ~ Wulfus",Dawn of the Dead
412,battlemike68,It dawned on me,10,22 April 2006,"The problem with horror films is that they are all copies of a few good movies that cannot ever be re-made or spawned off from. There is just no way that some one is going to make a great film like the Exorcist, or like Alien, or like The dawn of the Dead. These are milestones of horror and suspense. These film have integrity and everybody who tried to work off of those movies, I mean you tell me, there is not one film that comes close tho these. The problem is that people will go watch ""re-makes"" and rip-offs because they hope that it will come close to what they saw in the original films. So they spend money going to see a piece of crap, they really don't wanna see it but they give it a chance. And that's what the movie studios target! That's just lame and it shows that the film industry is an industry and not an artdustry. very very sad!",Dawn of the Dead
413,MerrittTheFerret,There's no more room in Hell...,10,30 April 2006,"I saw this movie in 2004, before the remake came out.Wow, breathtaking. This film is simply, breathtaking. It's the sequel to 1968's 'Night of the Living Dead,' but it's also something much, much more. It's a message in a bottle.The movie starts off three weeks after the zombie outbreak that was made famous in the little black and white indie film back in the 60s. Some reporters argue about social issues and zombies and other stuff while two people decide they're going to leave. They do, and then there's a gunfight at an old apartment building where people are refusing to kill the zombies. Another pair of people team up and decide to leave. They do. Soon the two pairs meet and get in a helicopter and head for a mall in Pittsburg. Then, the fun begins.The movie's message, is that if we let ourselves succumb to the comforts of the modern assets of everyday living, we will become nothing more than helpless creatures who cannot fight for ourselves. It's about commercialism. How commercializing everything isn't right. How putting a label on Coke and Pepsi and telling people to buy one or the other because the one's better but they're really just the same thing, you know? That's all, I hope you found this review entertaining.~ Alex Paine.",Dawn of the Dead

The acting is great, the directing is great and the movie is overall GREAT!  The part when they are looking over the railing at the dead bodies and Rogers pulls himself up to see always gets me.  Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger do a great job with the drama.  And Tom Savini the King of Splatter really produces lots of gore in this one.  Not as good as Day's gore but good.

I have to say that this film is so over hyped, (By Kim Williams) that I now think this film is complete rubbish. People that I've talked to about it say ""It's a portrayal of life in an unthinkable situation"". I think its very badly done.There's one scene where the audience sees down the aim of a gun and George Romero points to someone of every race. I think by this scene he's trying to show that the disaster would affect everyone. But the characters are so sterotypical it's almost sickening. I hate this film.",Dawn of the Dead
417,RabanRendon,The dead still walk the earth!,9,28 February 2020,"Taking place in the aftermath of Night of the Living Dead, Dawn pits two SWAT team members and a news production couple on the edge of the zombie apocalypse. The unlikely four take course to nowhere in a helicopter and settle on an abandoned shopping mall. Almost immediately the SWAT officers Peter and Roger take to the malls plentiful offerings looting and plundering while fending off zombies. They all unceremoniously decide that the mall is a perfect refuge from the hell outside, temporary or not. They all work together barricading the entries and ridding the mall of the lingering zombies. In due time, Roger gets bit and becomes one of the zombies. The remaining three are left to their own devices or lack of and become increasingly restless and bored with their materialist lives.Just when things were getting too peaceful and quiet, a traveling motorcycle gang heads to the mall demanding to be let in via radio communication. As you can guess, everything goes haywire in a ridiculous uproar of humans and zombies alike invading, killing and pillaging everything in sight.The film serves as a playful yet sardonic satire of consumerism that reverberates to this day! Every Black Friday swarms of consumers flock to retailers and department stores to consume. It's a scary reflection of our own sleepwalking society made horrific and fun.",Dawn of the Dead

419,facebookfredrik,Decent action movie - nothing more,5,22 June 2014,"What I want out of a horror movie is true horror - I want to be scared! Unfortunately, this movie didn't scare me at all. It may be a cult classic, beautifully cut, have great scores or casting, or whatever. I don't care much about that. At the end of a day, the reason I rent a horror movie is for it to scare the creeping heck out of me.The movie has lots of humor. I don't know if the gore is just cheesy or if it was made to be humorous, but that's what it is, and I appreciated that. However - IT DID NOT SCARE ME! Zombie hordes that you can easily plow through with a gun or a baseball bat, and who only hurt you because of your own stupidity aren't scary. They become more like enemy soldiers in, say a James Bond movie. There's no excitement when you know the hero will kill dozens of them without getting a single scratch (apart from, in this case, when the hero does something really stupid, causing the punishment on him/herself).So I give it a 5 star out of ten because of its entertainment value as a decent action movie, but if you're looking to be scared - which as I have pointed out is the reason why I watch horror movies - look for another title.",Dawn of the Dead
420,toddaustin76,What are you People Smoking???,2,30 April 2014,"After waking up this morning and flipping on the tube I caught the last 30 minutes of Day of the Dead, which is the third 'Dead' movie directed by George A. Romero. I had never seen Day of the Dead before and really enjoyed what I saw. It was funny, twisted and above all had good make-up and some really cool death scenes. Since I enjoyed this movie I thought I might check out Dawn of the Dead since it's always been hailed as the best of the 'Dead' movies, apart from the original. I thought I was in for quite a treat with Dawn of the Dead since the movie had acquired an 8.0 rating, which is way above respectable, especially for a horror movie. However, twenty minutes into the movie my expectations were put to death. I don't know how, but I managed to sit through the entirety of this movie and WOW was it disappointing. Even by sleazy, low budget, horror film standards it really sucks bad. There are many problems with the movie but my overall critique is that it's REALLY LONG AND REALLY BORING. The 'human' characters in the movie are bland and generic as hell. The actors performances are as stiff and lifeless as their zombie co-stars. The movie over all, apart from the zombie scenes, feels like an uninspired late 70's soap opera. It's DULL, DULL, DULL stuff. The biggest problem though is how not scary Dawn of the Dead is. One reason for this may be the drawn out pace of the movie or the lack of suspense and surprise. Oh, most importantly the ZOMBIES' MAKE-UP is beyond PATHETIC!!! I guess the budget couldn't find time for the most important aspect of the movie, which is the appearance of the zombies. The zombies are painted grayish-blue...and that's pretty much it. That's where the film really falls flat on it's face. I was really shocked how amateur the whole scope of the movie was. Really poor. Many people rated this movie highly. All I can think is that those people are zombies themselves and will watch anything that's put in front of them. For those of you who have not seen this movie, please don't waste your time. If you're itching for a little zombie fun you're much better off watching Return of the Living Dead (1985). Trust me on this one.",Dawn of the Dead
421,lonevector2000,"""Zombies On Fire!""",10,2 June 2005,"One of the best films in the zombie sub-genre, and indeed a true horror classic. George Romero's Dawn Of The Dead continues to both thrill and sicken fans and unsuspecting newbies, nearly twenty-seven years after it's initial release. With the Ultimate Edition DVD now available containing an exhaustive amount of assorted goodies and added features, the film that made flesh-eating ghouls a staple of grotesque cinema finally has it's day! The cast does an exceptional job with Ken Foree, in particular, delivering a towering, robust performance, and kudos to Gaylen Ross, whose story arc contributes an unexpected, moral dilemma not usually associated with this type of film. In the many years since Romero's masterpiece was released (unrated!!!) in the American and European markets, there has been a distressing amount of crass imitations and messy knock-offs diminishing somewhat the power and impact of this seminal work. If you want to see a landmark film that revels in it's own excess, and leaves that lovely taste of copper in your mouth, then set the alarm for ""Dawn"", and pray you don't oversleep!!!",Dawn of the Dead
422,super-cow,The best horror movie ever made...,9,13 April 2007,"Dawn of the Dead is probably the best horror movie ever made. The sequel to ""Night of the Living Dead"" takes place about 3 months after zombies, or as George A. Romero (writer director)likes to call them ""ghouls"" start attacking the living. If you haven't seen ""NotLD"" go see it before watching this movie its definitely worth a peek.Taking place in a world thats falling apart, four people attempt to just stay alive by escaping to a shopping mall via helicopter. Most of the movie follows them attempting to regain control of the mall which happens to be over run by zombies. DotD is more a movie about the personal feelings of George A. Romero on consumerism and materialism. The whole idea is basically a metaphor for people who just mindlessly pass through life, and often just spend money for no reason at all.The acting is pretty much top notch except for a few moments which are actually laughable. (Watch for Steven running into a zombie at an airport... you'll know what I mean. It's hilarious... also take note how many times Fran says ""OH FOR GODS SAKES!"") Other than what I just mentioned this movie does not suffer from any over the top acting, just typically movie mistakes.DotD is a top notch horror movie that pulls no punches, definitely one of the goriest movies I have ever seen in my life. There is a scene in an apartment complete that should surprise you. There is no lead up to the gore it just happens which definitely makes it hard to get ready for when someone is torn apart by 20 zombies. I haven't really ever been frightened by this movie but I am a huge fan of horror so I think I'm just too used to it. A must see for horror fans, or gore fans in general.All the music in this movie, with the exception of one song was all written by a band ""Goblin"", and from what I can tell was written for this movie. I enjoy the bizarre music in this movie, however, I can see how it would annoy some people to no end.All in all this is my favorite movie which I have watched probably a hundred times! From the first time I saw this movie I was hooked. If you enjoy zombie movies this is THE zombie movie to see. If your a fan of horror this is probably the best horror film ever made period, though not as scary as the first ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" it still surpasses it with the fairly detailed plot and tons of social commentary. If you don't like horror films, or zombie movies, or anything to do with the apocalypse then you probably wont enjoy this piece too much, this ones for fans of the genre.-After watching this one watch ""Day of the Dead"" an amazing sequel (with none of the same characters unfortunately) and the OK final zombie film from Romero in the series so far ""Land of the Dead""9/10 because it seems to be somewhat of a cult film and I think a 10 should appeal to all audiences. This is the flagship zombie film, the best ever made.",Dawn of the Dead
423,zombieX,The best movie ever made,10,15 September 1998,"Dawn of the Dead is a fascinating movie.  On the surface, it's a typical zombie movie, but as usual, George Romero is really saying so much more.  This movie isn't about zombies.  It's about people.  It asks the question of who the real monsters are.  The mall setting in this movie is great.  The zombies are shown as a reflection of American society, the way we are so drowned in consumerism.  At one point in the movie, Fran says, ""You're all hypnotized by this place.  It's so wrapped up in a neat little package you don't realize it's a prison too."" And throughout the movie we see the survivors slowly become what they despise as they become wrapped up in the materialism that the shopping mall offers. This is such a great movie, and it's much better if you watch it not just as a gory horror movie, which some people make the mistake of doing.  It's so much more than that.",Dawn of the Dead

I only happened to tune into it late at night, and managed to get hooked from the opening scenes.Mostly, the alternating humor/suspense and the overall attitude the film carries makes it an enjoyable experience.  At first, I thought I was possibly the only one laughing at some of the scenes until I came to this page and was surprised to see the film had such a history.My only small gripes with the movie were the running time and the ending.  I thought it played a little long, and although I may be missing the point, the focus at the end could have been spread to the big picture, instead of just the main characters.But aside from that, very decent fun.",Dawn of the Dead

The plot involves a mall, a few survivors and more bloodthirsty zombies than you ever saw in a movie.Comparable to a rollercoaster ride, this movie is non-stop action for well over 2 hours. Talk about never a dull moment. After this movie I compared every other horror-movie with Dawn, mind you I saw it at an early age. Unfortunately, it didn't get better than this gorefest. I'm only 24, but...do I dare say it... they don't make 'em like they used to. No CGI can compare to the realness of Tom Savini's make-up efx. There are different versions in circulation, but the European version is my favorite. Due to Goblin's incredible cool soundtrack.

I have a hard time understanding why this movie was banned because it's not that scary although it's true that some of the scenes with the Zombies eating cadavers are quite graphic.I'we seen both Romeros and Argentos version of this movie a couple of weeks apart, but I don't remember any differences in the two of them. I think this is the best movie in Romeros trilogy, although Day of the Dead is also very good as it has a nice eerie feeling thru the entire movie when the main characters are trapped in a building. Night of the Living Dead is ofcourse a true classic, but I don't remember it too well and the version released here in Finland is the 30th aniversary edition which is supposed to be a complete rip-off.I'we heard rumors that Romero is planning a fourth part to the series which would be in a nineties feeling: the people are accepting the Zombies and start living indifferent in fortified cities.

Even if some of the political commentary may go over your head you will still see how Remero showed how man's greatest demise is itself. If you're not into that kinda stuff(you probably do and don't know it) it's an amazing film. Although it's a horror it plays a lot like an adventure film, with every viewing I get visions of Mr. T and Murdock (A-team). It's hard to say if the effects wear good back in the 70's, sadly today they pale in comparison to Super Man Returns and what not. But that doesn't mean you won't get your panse scared off(can't believe I just said that). It's not really a ""boo I scared you"" kind of horror. It's more like ""the TV has gone out, the phone's not working and police are all running away in horror. Dude some serious s**t is about to go down"" followed by ""what now???"". Some one like me who thinks about things (way too much) finds this scary, it's all about ""what would you do?"". The acting is top notch, some may say it's emotionless acting. But if you think about it, the acting is probably close to what you would be doing... thinking. Just doing the ""1,000 yard stare"", thinking. The remake may be a good movie to cheer at with your buddies when a zombie gets light up, but the remake is something completely different.

Upon the first time watching it I was shocked. If there ever was to be a Zombie apocalypse this is what it would look like. The movie begins with a frantic news station that cant hold itself together with the unfold events. Then a SWAT team dukes it out with project patrons and zombies. Then 2 SWAT members and 2 news people high tail it in a stolen traffic copter. Their journey to find safety shows the world crumbling. National guard, rednecks, cops,etc. are shown trying to stop it. Then they land on a mall barricade it and well shop or steal or whatever. All seems fine and dandy until a army of looters on motorcycles show up to get a piece of the conquest which turns the mall into a literal war-zone between the good guys, bad guys and zombies. This movie has buckets of blood to accompany the painful deaths. Romero does an excellent job with the atmosphere. The characters are fine actors as well as the zombies.

In this movie, the main characters get locked in a zombie-infested mall. I was saying to myself ""how are they going to survive?"" But that question was answered by the characters using guns and fists to easily defeat any zombie that got close to them. Horror movies are good when there is lots of suspense, this movie had none! The characters were killing zombies left and right without any fight back! Also, in the middle of the movie, the characters attempt to live normal lives in the mall while the zombies were still in mall as well. Theres even a poorly done love story in this part. Toward the end of the movie, a motorcycle gang comes in and slaughters the zombies. This scene was supposed to represent human cruelty because the motorcyclists were ripping the zombies apart. I have seen this done in many more effective ways.

The end of the world atmosphere, the bizarre and real creepy zombies and the character dept made me loose my breath. I was new to the zombie genre and I really wanted to see the original, which everybody said was a lot better. So I sat down, with really high hopes and... just laughed myself to death. The real lousy make-up job, the more or less strange music, and the apocalyptic biker scene, I was very entertained, but also pretty disappointed. But this movie really creeps up under your skin and the more I thought of it, the more I realized how much the movie had affected me. Because of all the strange and dark scenes, this move has a sickly, claustrophobic atmosphere which occasionally made me have nightmares and lose a lot of sleep, no other movie has made me feel this sort of fear. So I watched it again and this time I really got scared. Every little detail in the movie, the music, the overly violent and gory parts, the great acting, contributes to the films unique mood. I bought the DVD and watched it over and over again, this is a movie that gets better for every time you watch it. You can also feel the panic of the entire human race as hope fades more and more, the whole world is in chaos and the humans are turning at each other everywhere. This movie isn't easy to love at first, but after a while you just totally capitulate. 9/10!",Dawn of the Dead
440,two_green_bottles,The definitive zombie film - !SPOILERS!,10,2 July 2004,"I saw Night of the Living Dead about a week before I watched Dawn, and I found it to be overrated. Maybe its aged and it doesn't seem to stand up next to other films made since, or maybe its just not my kind of film. Either way, Dawn was undoubtedly brilliant. It begins as a SWAT team raid a residential building in a zombie infested city. We see what state civilization is in, and watch as the SWAT team try to fight against renegade citizens, a hyper violent fellow officer and of course, hoards of zombies. Chaos is devouring them, and from this point it is unsettling to watch. Two of the officers then decide to desert their duties, and with the help of a couple of friends, fly away from the city in a helicopter. They stop at a mall for supplies, but before too long decide that it might be better to live there for a while. The only woman in the group is outspoken against, as she wants to move on, but the three men take control and insist on staying. Their greed takes over, and some of them end up paying the ultimate price for their greed. George A. Romero's message is clear, that our greed consumes us, further demonstrated by the biker gang at the film's climax. The main characters are truly likable, and I really worried for them as the film went on. I was attached throughout.",Dawn of the Dead
441,Kaneda_red,Night of The Living Dead Sequel - Hmmmmmmmmm??,6,29 June 2006,"After a horrific apartment evacuation a band of rebels attempt to escape the zombie hordes from eating their livers, in doing so they embark upon a deserted shopping mall. Despite the luxury of the mall, nothing lasts forever and as tensions run high their excessive consumerism is in jeopardy from a group of biker bandits and of course our old friends........the walking dead.Dawn of The Dead is a story about survival and social function. The vicar who feeds the basement zombies highlights this theme. Romero brings out the life of his film in the mall even if it is a long time coming. When it comes its pleasantly enjoyable. But Nothing more. The awe factor comes when teeth sinks into flesh. Its unedited, raw and innovative. Zombies chewing chunks out of their victims torsos will effect even todays desensitised generation.Poor acting causes the film to suffer. In fact crap acting makes the film suffer. Its not even the camp enjoyable B-moviesque acting its just awful acting. It has become very dated in style and substance despite its subject and this is all dragged out by the running time.Those with an interest in Zombie flicks should know this is essential viewing but not a timeless piece of film. I would recommend Night of The Living Dead instead.",Dawn of the Dead
442,criehle,How did this film ever become a classic?,1,13 February 2005,"This has got to be one the most boring, lack luster, truly horrible horror movies I have ever seen. This film did not scare me nor did ever thrill me. Maybe I expectations were too high or maybe simply I read to many fan reviews online and they over-hyped it. Whatever the case was this film is simply terrible. How did this film ever become a classic?The first thing that is wrong with this movie is the slow moving zombies. Zombies that chase after you at .001 miles per hour is hardly scary. It is so easy to escape slow moving zombies that I wonder how on earth you could make 3 movies in a row where the zombies are the antagonist. The zombies are so dull and boring that not even the characters in the film are scared of them.There are so many scenes in this movie where a character would see a zombie coming at him/her and they would show this look of mild concern. Whenever a zombie would charge someone that person would casually and calmly load their gun, take aim, and shoot. This is a lesson all film makers should learn. If the characters in the movie aren't scared of the villains whoever he, she, it may be, then the audience won't be scared. If the characters are going to casually, and easily, dispose of the zombies then I am not as hell sure going to feel scared whenever I see one.The make up & gore effects in this film is quite simply a joke. Maybe at the time they were top of the line & state of the art. But now I look at them and I simply laugh at the cheesiness of it. Tom Savini is a great make up artist. I know because I've seen his work elsewhere like in the Firday the 13th movies. I don't know if the lousy effects were a result of low budget or lack of talent at the time. The blood in the movie is orange for god sake. You think the least they would be able to pull off is real looking blood and not blood that looks like concentrated orange juice.This film is also known for its symbolism & stabs at the American consumer society. How on this earth this film ever got that reputations is beyond me. There is one, count them one, line making a stab at American consumers. It is when the characters first land on the mall roof and they begin to wonder why there are so many zombies there. One character remarks that it is probably because those people spent so much time there that it becomes almost instinct. Thats it. That is where this film get its fame for insulting consumers. Its all because of one quick, non-important, non plot related, line.I will never understand why this film has managed to stand the test of time. I can possibly see why this film might have been scary when it was first released. But looking at it now I am amazed its not under comedy isle in the video stores.",Dawn of the Dead
443,S-block,"The first I Saw, The one that got me hooked",9,12 October 2005,"I first saw this movie when I was about 13 on Sky Movies Gold, I had never heard of Romero at this point and never seen any of the other movies. The first time I saw it I found it almost comic and thought it was a comedy horror throughout with the lumbering zombies and the looting of the mall with unnecessary items in such a world (i.e money). It wasn't till after watching the movie that the true horror set in, I don't know what actually ended up scaring me whether it was the humans, with the worry about material wealth in a world that is based on survival and the havoc they cause or the zombies who seem relatively harmless most of the time. The zombies are mearly opportunistic, in that they cant really get at you unless you give them the opportunity as is shown at the beginning and end of the movie.Romero in this movie also points out rather artfully that no matter what happens in the world no matter what dangers are presented there are some people that will not let go of hatred (shown at the start as the racist SWAT member goes ape) or at the end when Roger cant let the Bikers take the mall without cost. This is not only consumerism gone mad, it also shows how easy it is to lose humanity, and its a bloody good gore fest movie to boot.Its the one that made me a steadfast Romero fan.",Dawn of the Dead
444,thrice_josh,Romero should do stand-up comedy...,8,9 October 2005,"When i watched this movie I laughed till it hurt. I have so much respect for this movie its not even funny. Romero should do stand-up comedy or prop comedy using his fake arms and guts and other sh*t that he probably stole from movie sets,lol. If the day comes and he thinks about it i will be there front row cheering him on no matter how good or crappy he is because he is the zombie master.ahh..the movie of course. I think this movie is the root connecting to all zom/comedy. It is such an original, not even night of the living dead can match up to its reputation. The scene when roger changes into a zom is priceless, he looks bald and wrinkly, which is kind of hard to explain because all of the other zombies have blue faces and some chunks of flesh missing but they basically looked the same except with these new features. In roger's case he changes so much like i explained earlier. It is a scene of hilarity and confusion. Romero influenced me to be a zombie fan after i watched ""night"". When i watched this one i knew i couldn't wait for ""land of the dead"" which is a mighty fine picture to view. Overall i give this movie a 10/10",Dawn of the Dead

Zombies, zombies and more zombies. The setting in a mall (in 1978) gives a nice flashback to a time when you could buy a gun in the mall. What I really liked, seeing it again after all this time, is how you get a feel for the culture of the time it was made. Seeing stores with different logos than what you are used to is a nice pop-culture revelation.The other thing which really blew me away (and I can't validate it) is the guy who plays the traffic reporter. He is listed as David Emgee(?) from Indiana, but he could be a dead ringer for Hugh Laurie (from ""House"" & ""Flight of the Phoenix""). I check IMDb and other sources and it apparently is a different actor and not the pseudonym I was hoping for. - Look the next time you watch.Enjoy...",Dawn of the Dead

448,Karloff,Romero didn't disappoint,10,23 September 1998,"After the cult success enjoyed by Night of the Living Dead, and the box office failures of his next few films, one might think that George Romero would return to the Living Dead for a quick buck. If you thought that, I would encourage you to reconsider. Dawn of the Dead is, in some ways, superior to his 1968 classic. First of all, the production values were much higher, allowing Romero to accomplish more in terms of sets and talent. Tom Savini was back from Vietnam, so he was available to gross out the world with his fabulous effects. But this film goes way beyond gore; there is a strong social commentary that exists throughout this film. Romero's message is that of commercialism, and how much it seems to mean to Americans. It is no mistake that most of the film takes place in a shopping mall. When I walk through my local mall, it always brings me back to visions of this movie, and all the mindless zombies who just can't wait to get inside the stores. Before I ramble too long, I would just like to thank George Romero & Co. for a really great film.",Dawn of the Dead

Making the place into a sort of home where they have everything they will ever need. Until they are found by demented bikers who ruin their plans of living in the mall. The gore at this point is lots of and plenty of. The heads are rolling and the blood is pouring in this horror masterpiece. Starring Ken Foree, Gaylen Ross, David Emge and Scott H.

453,paul-460,Postmodern Postmortem Poe,8,19 June 2003,"Dawn of the Dead is a true horror film. Everyday scenes are transported to the strange but imagineable world of the truly vile and threatening.  Our daily habits (wandering thoughtlessly around supermarkets pushing trolleys) are mocked by the zombies who cannot help but repeat post-mortem their daily routines. They are slow, but they only need to get you once...and they have more than a lifetime to do it!A superb follow-up to ""Night"", and made much later,  but it fits well in the late 70's with it's TV trash commercial pessimism. A postmodern Poe, perhaps?Ultimately everyone gets out of this what they are prepared to invest.  I watched as a fed-up teenager in (at the time) depressed UK with punk invading the music charts. It was part of the era which mocked the day to day dull, repetitive, boring lives of our parents. It warned against complacency (or look what will happen - you will end up a zombie!). It was the film your parents hated - so you went and liked it!!This film will have its place in history. OK, there are plenty of criticisms to be made - the dialogue is sometimes weak, the lighting, camera work etc are all easy targets, but that misses the point. It's like a horror reality TV show that really happens. Who cares about the technicalities or the dialogue when some zombie's dragging his festering dead body at YOU?!",Dawn of the Dead
454,big eric,A horror classic,9,28 November 2000,"While it is certainly not everyone's cup of tea, this film, I believe, should be considered when you want to watch a film which will make you think. While the special effects are dated and the acting is not perhaps the greatest, this film still manages to excite. Its story line is standard horror movie stuff - zombies chase after our heroes - but the way that the film is made and the director's attention to detail is excellent. The eerie shopping complex, where the majority of the film is shot, strikes fear into your heart. The clever use of distant TV transmissions provide a connection with the outside which can seemingly never be reached. The camera work and the music create a tense situation where you are never 100% sure that any of the hero characters are safe. But, the overall picture does present the viewer with a concern - that if something terrible was to happen to the earth, how would mankind cope. I believe you must watch this film and enjoy what is presented visually, but at the same time, you must understand the deeper meaning to it all and appreciate just how good this film really is.",Dawn of the Dead

I won't say whether this is better than Night though, because they are very different films. Both great. This is the one that inspired all those modern zombie movies. It was quite popular in Europe, inspiring many Spanish and especially Italian zombi flicks (Fulci, Lenzi...). Not to mention the Resident Evil video games. What to say, that already hasn't been mentioned. The whole film is quite an experience. From start to finish it has been a great ride. Romero's direction is great. The soundtrack, the acting's fine. Great make-up and special effects. Savini truly did a great job here. This is maybe the best thing about the film. The gore effects are very well done. I would say grab some beers, sit back, relax and watch those mindless zombies getting killed.",Dawn of the Dead

This movie though was one of the goriest. They used real intestines (animal)and for those of you who don't know it, Tom Savini was the special effects guy on this movie and played the part of one of the motorcycle guys. Nobody knows what has caused the zombies to rise from the dead and it's ""shoot them in the head or cut their head off"" as always but it still has a lot of eeriness and fright factor to it.

457,Darkblood1,One of the Greatest Horror Films,10,22 March 2002,"George Romero's Dawn of the Dead is one of the best zombie/horror films of the last 25 years.  In many cases just as classic as the original B&W Night of the Living Dead.  Dawn of the Dead's greatest points that makes it stand out from all the other clones and copies is a ugly picture of society in decline.  Lack of communication and misunderstanding of the enemy is clearly the point of the film.  Sure the FX are a little dated by today's CGI laden epics of recent years, but there is a underlying creepiness and sadness to the film that cannot be caputured yet by a computer.  But overall the story and the atmosphere that Romero has created for the film is the light that most other zombie film strive for.  The film's satire of consumerism and greed are great and setting in a mall of all places is just classic.  So I hope everyone can sit back and enjoy the campy music and afros and bellbottoms of the 70's and enjoy probably one of the most dramatically sound and overall masterpieces of the late 70's before zombie films became comic horror disasters.  One of the best of the 70's.",Dawn of the Dead

Of course I was a child when I saw it back in my classic horror movie days, but I found the music so compelling and serious in the face of a pretty much tongue in cheek film. So I have to give lots of points to Goblin, an Italian group that also did the score for Susperia, another film classic horror. At the time this film was also one of the grossest movies out there. And gushing gore makes this type of film fly. And of course, Romero is a master of the mindless Zombie movie.",Dawn of the Dead

Romero's Dead Saga (the first being the revolutionary Night of the Living Dead), is a highly enjoyable, classic adventure film. I say adventure because if it were anything but zombies, that's what everyone would define this as! The characters are about as smart as you can expect movie characters to be (a welcome change from action/adventure/horror films populated with nimrods), the dialogue is well done, the music lends a playful aire to the situation, the makeup effects are fantastic (though the majority of the Dead are just blue dusted), and the camera work is excellent. The story is classic Romero- lined head to toe with social commentary. This film was once called Louis XIV meets zombies, and that just about fits the bill. The four main characters, two TV station workers, and two SWAT team members, jack the station's traffic chopper, and make a break for safety. They find a shopping mall, and end up locking themselves in, a world of rampant consumerism at their fingertips. The story is really great, and the whole ride is fun, funny, and memorable. You WILL remember this movie, I guarantee. If you get a chance to choose between the three different cuts (Directors, Theatrical, and European) go for the Directors. All cuts are enjoyable, but the Directors is by far the best. DVD buyers- don't spend 90+ bucks at an auction for this baby- this fall, Anchor Bay is releasing a decked out release of this with tons of extras and all three cuts, transfered from a near perfect quality print!",Dawn of the Dead

Gore Meastro Tom Savini is at his best creating fun and intriguing ways of how the Dead can be topped off.Also with a weird and creepy score created by Argento and the Zombies was a perfect way of keeping the film at a Dooms day feel.This Movie is an All time Classic and inspired me to view all horrors with an open mind and not to watch just for the gore, George A Romero is the best in the business when it comes to the Dead films Hitting the nail on each one of them.

Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD is simply the best zombie horror film ever made, and very likely the best one that ever will be made.It is THE GODFATHER, GONE WITH THE WIND, STAR WARS, KING KONG (the list could go on and on) of zombie films. The film starts a couple of weeks after the events of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Whereas in that film things seem to be under control at the end. In the first 10 minutes of DOTD we see that is definitely not the case. The dead are rising and devouring the living at a rate that society can not handle and it is collapsing on top of itself. Four people (two SWAT team members, a news helicopter pilot, and his girlfriend) decide to leave Philadephia and try to head anywhere to escape the coming apocalypse. After almost buying the farm trying to refuel the helicopter they land on the roof of a shopping mall. The rest of the film details their attempts (and failures) to make their own utopia inside the shopping mall.The cast is great, the script excellent, the special effects the stuff of legend (FX master Tom Savini is responsible). Romero never had more complete control of any film he made before or after. And he and Savini are the perfect match. Romero writes and directs and Savini executes (in more ways than one) the special effects. DOTD is simply put George Andrew Romero's MASTERPIECE.

The zombies present an evident threat and fear, but they also have a quantity of great comic relief (well at least it was to me...).  Seeing that this was made in 1978, you have to give it up to G.Romero, for making such a movie with the budget he had.  I advise you to check out all three parts (night, dawn, and day).  If you have yet to enjoy them.  Also go to see the remake, and support the movies.  (but, if you have yet to see the first DAWN OF THE DEAD.

464,kaylakaze,Overrated snoozefest,3,21 December 2008,"I just watched this (I finished it like 5 minutes ago) and I agree. This movie could have been pretty decent (for a 1978 film with bright orange-red tempur paint looking blood) if it were around 90 minutes long. At 140 minutes, there's just way too much boring stuff. The characters are completely unlikable and barely smarter than the zombies. The first 20 minutes was decent enough because there was a lot of action. I'm not entirely sure what the action was about, but there was action, and heads exploding and cops. Then it was boring for a while. Then one of the main characters flails strangely at a zombie that wasn't bothering him. Then it's boring for a very long time and the characters have time to show you how annoying and stupid they are. I'm starting to think at this time that I was supposed to be cheering for the zombies. Then, with about 25 minutes left, something interesting happens and the movie gets watchable. People say the movie is full of social commentary (hopefully they're not referring to the ""der, shoppers are like zombies"" crap), but the only time I saw it was in this end part, and it was far from subtle. And this is the only part of the movie (apart from the couple of minutes in the beginning) where there's any halfway decent gore.Not funny. Not scary. Not creepy. Not very exciting. If there was any useful ""social commentary"" value or interesting dramatic irony in it, as there was in Night of, I sure didn't see it. I'm willing to give it the benefit of a doubt and say maybe back in its day it was good, but it certainly doesn't hold up.

It shows how people of diverse backgrounds can come together and start to rely on each other as if they were family. Folms like this and Halloween prove that you don't need special effects or sex to make a great picture. Sometimes the best movies are character driven ones with simple plots and characters who mind their surroundings and think on their feet. The acting is great and you can really see the character's personalities! In my very humble opinion this is much better than Night of the Living Dead and The Walking dead.

While the movie itself is very bloody, it never takes itself to seriously. That is one of the many reasons why DOTD is so outstanding.The film starts off in a news station that has been reporting on the ""Zombie Apocalypse"" since it began. Fran who works at the news station learns that her boyfriend, Stephen, has a helicopter and plans on getting out of this while he still can.Meanwhile a police officer, Roger, is seen with his squad clearing out an urban building of Zombies. While doing so he meets up with Peter, the calm African-American male police-officer. They smoke and exchange words, we learn that Roger was invited by Stephen to join him on the helicopter. Roger offers Peter a place on the chopper and the movie is pretty much on it's way.Our four hero's meet up at the helicopter and set flight to where they can find safety. This safety comes in the form of a mall in which they set up base.The four of them have plenty of run-ins with zombies and other survivors alike, which fill up this two-hour long movie with plenty of fun and exciting moments.Overall Dawn of the Dead is the greatest zombie, and possibly horror film, of all time.

All they had was spam, so even if she did have a can opener, it would be useless.  those are just a couple things to think about.  But, still I loved this movie, even though the blood was basically bright orange, but it was great.",Dawn of the Dead
472,Mick T,True horror,9,4 June 1999,"I have seen many horror films and I rate this as one of the best. For me it was made with a different viewpoint to other horror movies. The fact that the zombies don't pose that much of a threat, but the problem of surviving in a world torn apart by them does (the true horror!) makes this film unique in its genre.....and rather enjoyable!",Dawn of the Dead
473,Ike-25,Dramatic and Suspenseful,10,6 June 1999,"With this, the second installment of the dead trilogy, George Romero proves his mastery as a director. This movie is by far the best zombie movie of all time. Four individuals flee the city of Philadelphia in the hopes of escaping the horror of the zombie invasion. They are able to create a perfect world in an abandoned shopping mall but unfortunately it won't last. The characters in this film were well developed and easy to identify with. Their attitudes and emotions seemed very realistic. Thus Romero creates tremendous suspense every time they are in danger. On top of well thought out action sequences this movie is full of symbolism and meaning, truly a must see. (10 out of 10)",Dawn of the Dead
474,Ed Wood-3,Satire and horror mixed together,10,23 August 1999,"Hands-down the best (horror) film of all-time, nothing can match the range of DOTD. It masterfully combines humour, gore, suspense, and action into a rollercoaster ride. The zombies go from deadly to idiotic to harmless and the humans start to change as well. The concept of  the shopping mall as a place where the dead would want to return is genius and it plays as a social satire on top of the gore. In short, the best film of all-time!",Dawn of the Dead
475,shemraj,Masterpeice,10,21 June 2000,"There are many spoilers included in my review so if you haven't seen the movie yet don't (and don't want it spoiled) read on.
This I believe to be (arguably) Romero's greatest work (though many may argue I preferred this title to Night). All the shots in this movie are done masterfully and the actor's strengths are well deployed and used. The Context of the Movie being the world gone crazy by the dead returning to life and the chaos that follows this. The most amazing thing about this movie is Romero's view on humans and how self-destruction is built into our nature.Okay so here's the plot The story follows shortly after night and the zombies have started to take over all major cities and towns due to the large populations and the rate at which the disease is able to spread. Three people wishing to survive have arranged a meet up point and a helicopter (hoping to fly over the mess). The three people are a specialist Police officer, a Reporter and a Copter pilot who also dates and works at the same TV studio as the reporter. When they meet up the policeman has brought an extra special ops officer with him and they find the reporter and the pilot in dire straits with an another group of people trying to escape. They soon talk them down and both parties make a run for it. Whilst flying they spot a mall which they land on. This is soon seen as a defensible spot with plenty of food and water to help them survive the following months (maybe even years). So they decide to hold up their clear it of Zombies and barricade themselves in everybody but the reporter sees this as a good thing (the reporter sees this as a prison). To further complicate matters it is now found out the Reporter is pregnant. This is a short description of the first half of the film and I believe it is brilliant as it has a good mix of action and warming up to the main characters making you acutely feel the situation and problems they are facing, this beginning also takes you closer to the maliee at the ending of the film rather then distancing you from it which sadly many other movies do.The movie in my belief follows the concept that if you throw a chaotic factor into the world the world will turn to chaos and that survival according to each individual human being is to look after self and not to help those around you. There are three scenes that I believe this particularly stands out in the first being when the manager of the Broadcasting studio is showing out of date information of rescue centres that have now been over-run this purely being due to the fact that he does not wish to lose any of his viewers considering the maliee in the world outside this shows an abundance of self-interest with no good result. The second being when the old preacher walks out of a basement room saying you can have them now u is stronger then us but soon I think they be stronger then you' (forgive me if this is not an exact quote).  This says to me that not just the people but the government also are responsible for the uprising of the zombies by the general willingness to kill any person that does not conform to their wishes adding to the general population of zombies and decreasing the population of humans. This also shows the blatant disrespect of culture and society as well as the ignorance towards fellow mans pain. The final one that stands out in my mind as memorable is the scene where black special ops man says when there is no more room left in hell the dead will walk the earth'. This sentence I think is so powerful I think in simplistic terms it explains how much evil there is on the earth and how much we hurt each other. This says to me we must live in such a degraded society that we have literally filled hell with our evil souls and have had to occupy new space thus creating our own hell on earth. This furthers my point that this shows abundance of self-interest and pity.
This I believe is a must see movie and what I have written above just talks a little about my feelings on the movie (all which I believe arguable), I could literally fill a book on how much this movie effected me and made me see things in a different way.Final Verdict absolutely brilliant a must see movie (but may not cater to your taste).",Dawn of the Dead
476,The Movie Lover,Zombie Heaven,10,3 February 2000,"This is by far the greatest zombie movie of all time. I have watched it over 20 times, and it gets better every time you see it. Despite what other people have said, i think that the effects are really good. Especially for the 1970's.

477,Man_Whose_Head_Expanded,Good? I nearly bought a hat!,10,14 June 2006,"It isn't hard to see why George Romero has such a cult following, reams of fans go on pilgrimages to the mall that Dawn of the dead was shot in. This film is George's undeniable masterpiece in terms of characters, plot and mass appeal. It has charm, wit and great character development. I am in constant turmoil over whether I prefer this or Day of the dead. I won't bore you with details of Romero's superb social commentary, as its constant mention by other reviewers is quite enough. The greatest question this film seems to ask is whether the film is an action film or a horror film; it could even be viewed as a comedy. The genius of this movie is the mass appeal it offers. It gracefully crosses genres whilst maintaining a strong story and tone. This unlike many other films of the often shat upon genre that is the zombie genre has characters that you like, you don't want them to die and you truly care for their well being. Nearly all of the horror films to come out in the next ten years under the collective title of video nasties don't carry the element of sympathy that I certainly felt for the characters. By the standards of the video nasty period this film could be viewed as tame. The film hasn't let a small budget compromise the story, yes some effects may look dated especially when compared to the technically astounding Day of the dead but this film doesn't need a big budget. This film is the sort of film that must be dug out of a dusty archive at around the age of 15 and then it is a portal in the rest of Romero's work. It is probably his most accessible film that allows people to enter his pessimistic and shockingly accurate portrayal of the world, society and a hesitance towards the military. Many horror films come and go, each trying to up the ante in gore and depravity. Dawn of the dead stands strong and militant, refusing to fade into fan boy obscurity and attracting generation after generation of fans, each falling into its trap. The film draws you into the oh so brilliant world of George Romero. It is fantasy, it is horror, it is satire and yes, it is a masterpiece.",Dawn of the Dead
478,DrNordo,"A brilliant movie, but with some faults that I find hard to ignore",7,27 June 2009,"I am going to start out by saying that I absolutely love this movie. I am a big zombie fan altogether and this is by far my favorite zombie movie and indeed my favorite Romero movie. I will start out with what I like about this film.The atmosphere, action, and the levels of gore used are very good (atmosphere wasn't perfect, I'll get to that later). In today's era of film making, where horror films tend to rely on overly gruesome scenes (not that I don't enjoy that on occasion, mind you), Dawn of the Dead is able to deliver its tension without overdoing it. Is there a lot of gore? Yes there is. It would be hard to make a zombie survival movie without it. But it never feels like the movie is trying to stand on that leg alone, which is something that I really appreciated about it.The characters I thought were also very well delivered. They were somewhat clichéd, especially Francine, the incompetent damsel in distress, but considering this movie was made over 30 years ago these clichés are forgivable. The acting was decent to good and you actually care about these characters. In many other zombie flicks this isn't the case with me and I oftentimes find myself rooting for the zombies and praying that they quickly eat these annoying characters. Not so in this.Perhaps the best aspect of this movie, especially considering its genre, is Romero's biting social commentary. In a world where material goods have become meaningless, these characters still feel the need to stock up on luxuries such as designer clothes, watches and money, despite the very obvious fact that there are more important things to be worrying about. And isn't that just the way it really is? Romero saw this very clearly and it is an aspect of humanity that has become ever more prevalent as time has passed. One can also compare mankind with the meandering and aimless nature of these zombies who go around caring only about where their next meal is coming from. In this regard this movie is remarkably intelligent.As for what I didn't like, I found the musical score to be extremely annoying at times. It sometimes took away from the atmosphere I would have found more appropriate and made the whole thing seem a little silly. And in one major scene where a team of bikers try to lay siege to the mall I found it absolutely ridiculous how they behaved around the zombies by throwing pies in their faces, squirting them with water, teasing and taunting them, and measuring their own blood pressure despite imminent danger. I just found it hard to swallow.All in all I enjoyed the movie very much but think it would have been far superior if Romero had kept more of a Night of the Living Dead atmosphere and mood throughout this movie.Thank you for reading.",Dawn of the Dead
479,simonpark,"OK, but just doesn't cut it with modern cinema",6,28 January 2007,"To be fair i was born 10 years after this movie was made, but that hasn't stopped me enjoying movies of the same decade (taxi driver, apocalypse now, the godfather, the warriors and so on) but where these films have carried themselves well over the years, dawn of the dead has not, i fully understand and appreciate how it managed to bring the genre into the mainstream. However horror should not be associated with this film, being a massive fan of the genre i know there are dozens if not hundreds of techniques involved in scaring the audience, Romero only manages to implement a few, most of which are cancelled out by other factors (for example the fact that the zombies can turn you with a single bite and do not fear death is made irrelevant by the fact that they are so unbelievably slow and mal-co-ordinated that you'd have to be an idiot to get bitten) this said it is manageable to make up for flaws like this with some good old fashioned arse kicking! again, this movie falls short, when i think of zombie action i immediately picture a bad-assed shotgun wielding hero shooting off limbs here and there and generally laying the smack-down but this movie couldn't be further from it. The zombie kills are few and far between and when the occasional zombie does get shot, there is no force behind it, it would just fall to its knees then die, when we really want its head getting blown off with a magnum or torso being torn apart by an automatic, another factor that is a rare treat in the horror scene is comedy, although this film did make me chuckle from time to time it only made it a tad more bearable, so i guess you may be wondering why i gave this a six star and not less, the reason why is because without films like this there would never be 28 days later or other modern classics, this film served well as a wrung (however low) in the ladder and for that i am thankful but it just doesn't cut it in the modern arena, film and culture has changed too much!",Dawn of the Dead
480,hugsbugsbunny,zombie at its best,9,11 May 2008,"i saw this yesterday, and i must saw i am impressed. Romero expertly depicts the social degeneration, and the emotion of the people who still feel an attachment to the undead. Many people have complained about the quality of the acting, but it isn't as bad as many people would have you believe, considering most people will only watch this for the extreme gore, myself included. however, i found that this had heart, as well as brains (haha) and genuinely developed emotion for the characters and didn't find myself bored by the talky bits. of course, there is the violence. it ranges from bloodless to full on sick. one scene featuring entrails was almost too much for me, and i have seen many gory films. there is the iconic exploding head, and whilst it doesn't match scanners, it is still a brilliant effect.The only mild let down are the zombies themselves. Considering this was made on a mildly limited budget, Romero has done an OK job, but considering the money he has spent on fake blood and guts, surely he could have made the zombies look at least a little scary?overall however, this is a brilliant film that should be watched by everyone.other zombie films that you should enjoy: 28 days later: 8/10 28 weeks later: 10/10 night of the living dead: 9/10",Dawn of the Dead

485,Greypaws,Wacky Zombie Hijinks,8,22 February 2003,"[WARNING: Spoilers] This review is of the theatrical release. Night of the Living Dead was scary. It's a bit outdated by today's standards, but it still managed to instill a sense of dread in me, and was effectively frightening. Dawn of the Dead, the sequel, is the complete opposite, but is no less entertaining. This movie is by no means boring, but it's not scary, either. At all. Aside from a disturbing room of feasting ghouls at the beginning and a gruesome disembowelling near the end, the gore effects in this movie are so fake that they only add to the laugh value. The movie seems to have been made just to poke fun at the ghouls. The foursome of humans that inhabit the zombie-infested mall act like complete buffoons. More often than not, they seem to completely forget that there are ghouls everywhere, and let the living dead get within two feet of them before they bother looking up to see if anyone is coming to eat them. They risk their lives to drive trucks up to block the mall doors, even though they leave plenty of room for the ghouls between the trucks and doors (luckily the zombies can't smash through the glass doors anyway). Later, when an insane Mad Max-style biker gang tries to invade the mall, they simply drive the trucks out of the way (guys the good guys left the keys in them). Even with this type of utter idiocy, they still manage to outsmart the ghouls. The only person the poor zombies outsmart, rather than simply outnumber, is the sombrero-wearing biker who decides that the middle of a ghoul-infested mall is the best place to find out his blood pressure. Dawn of the Dead is a downright zany movie with only a bit of true horror or emotion and clumsy, obvious anti-consumer commentary to interrupt the crazy undead antics. The acting is good, though the characters are unrealistic. I give it 8/10 stars, but as a comedy, not a horror movie.",Dawn of the Dead

For those that hate horror, then I suggest you give this film a look, if you can get past the gore, as the story is very interesting indeed.

My thoughts were simply: there is no real shock value, the movie is not scary, the acting is poor, and the plot progresses at an ultimately slow speed. After reading positive upon positive reviews for this film, I began to wonder what exactly it was about Dawn of the Dead that people found appealing, so I gave it another go a couple of years after seeing it for my first time. I was impressed the second time watching it. I kept an opened mind, and I found myself immersed in the movie. GOBLIN's retro-styled and eerie soundtrack sets the mood to feel like an indie sci-fi film, in which it fits perfectly with the setting of the film, forcing me to feel like the four people inside the mall may be the only ones left on earth.It took some time to accept that Romero's zombies weren't relentless, agile, athlete-zombies like they were in the 2004 remake, but slow, staggering, blue faced zombies covered in neon red blood - but it works. The film is somewhat slow paced because the epidemic is slow, and the zombies themselves are slow. The zombies are a threat to the group in large numbers, and it's the overwhelming sense of feeling trapped and alone that really makes this film a successful thriller. If you can keep an opened mind when watching this film, it's likely you will grow to appreciate it for what it is - a thought-provoking, sometimes cheesy, well-humored zombie flick. Very entertaining!",Dawn of the Dead

I do not deny that this film is scripted and directed okay for the time it was made in but by today's standards this just is by no way a film worth watching.Excitement in this film is close to zero, zombies move at a snail like pace which made my angry that the fact the characters in the film (none of which are particularly well developed) are stupid enough to get bitten. If you have seen this film you will know what I am referring too, it would seem at points the characters have no intention of surviving. The apparent lack of interest in survival begins to get very annoying through out this film and scenes where soldiers allow zombies to advance upon and take a chunk of flesh out even though they have a loaded gun definitely leave the watcher with a sense of confusion to why all the Americans in this film seem so incapable of killing these apparently threatening zombies.The blue make up placed on zombies is not effective and looks more comical than scary. Personally I don't know how this film got so high reviews as by today's standards it is a bad film.....",Dawn of the Dead
491,heithemboukari,Very disappointing zombie movie,1,18 September 2013,"I am a big horror movie fan and I was recently checking the top horror movie list on timeout London to find my next thrill! I realized that the ""Dawn of the Dead"" from 2004 is a remake of the 1978 Zombie. Since it was ranked number 10 of all horror movies in this list and had a rating of 8/10 on IMDb I was very excited to watch this film! I am usually unbiased when it comes to ""old"" movies (as I was a big fan of the birds and other pre-80s movies), but I sure had some expectations towards this movie (due to the high rating)! But this one failed to entertain me in any way and I can't understand the high rating. From a horror movie fan's perspective it is lousy cause it doesn't create any suspense and you won't be scared at all. The zombies are so harmless it's hard to imagine that they could release an epidemic spreading across the world! (Spoiler alert) They are so slow every time they approach, you can take your time thinking of a new idea how to kill them, PLUS they don't even look scary! (Spoiler alert) The scene when they landed with the helicopter at a random gas station is picturesque for the movie. While the SWAT agent is refueling the helicopter the others are inspecting the area and eventually encountering some zombies, which are eliminated without breaking a sweat, which does not keeping this one guy from saying ""there is no escape!"" WTF. But even though one zombie is coming closer to the helicopter the SWAT guy is not nervous or scared and just finishes refueling. It's so ridiculous, that you are even cheering for the stupid zombies to finally reach and attack one of the characters. I am not a person who is acting cool and just saying I was not scared, cause just one day before I watched ""The Conjuring"" and it gave me the creeps! On top of that the acting is bad (especially the helicopter pilot sucks!), the make up of the zombies is crappy even for 1978 (""Star Wars"" and ""Jaws"" had been already in the cinemas) the soundtrack is so not fitting (it didn't create a suiting atmosphere) and to be honest I fell asleep shortly after they reached the mall and I guess this also does not support the movie.So, maybe I'll read some more positive reviews to get an idea why this piece of crap is so high rated!",Dawn of the Dead
492,abcdefghmnzx-352-384463,DAWN not YAWN,10,24 April 2012,"George A. Romero, with his debut 1968 ""Night of the Living,"" the genre of quasi-founded and tied by the rules. The undead follow the desire for meat. You need the meat to survive as food around, it is simply the urge to eat the drives them. They have no or very little intelligence, as a reporter in the film says on TV. They move slowly shuffling away. A targeted hit in the head or a separate body from the head of the ""kill"" a zombie. The movie is recommended by experts time and again on TV, clean with large-scale police or military actions, the city, is also spoken by bombs. But it seems like nothing happens, probably the undead seem to take even more land than you can imagine.This is what makes the movie. The undead are an omnipresent threat. Romero, she is not a shocker as in dark corners. The zombies are everywhere. More like a natural disaster, the man forced to flee and leave everything back to him what is of value. In the helicopter to leave the chat Four what they do. Two of them have returned ex-spouse, a two brothers.Romero is therefore based on this framework act more like people react in such a situation would be. In a situation where the country is on the chasm, where even the police and the military can seemingly do anything or want to do anything and there is nothing of value expire and the social values. In one scene, the four observed from the helicopter, how to help the country to a group of civilians in the gulf and hunters with hunting rifles to the army and organize a zombie-shooting. Here you can see exactly how lax even the military deal with this threat. Instead of reacting quickly to make the soldiers take a break and take care of inexperienced beginners can work against the undead.The situation is that Romero created the Mall awesome. Each time the idea was probably to be and do anything to be able to alone in a huge shopping center what you want. It is precisely in this hostile world the chance to do so arises is mistaken. Also, the director also shows again that the undead can not be underestimated. The military continues to do so and will probably soon realize that they have no chance and the cash receipt for their behavior. But our four friends at the mall come in such situations. Several times they narrowly slip past it overrun by zombies or be bitten because they were just too careless. Two of the four underestimate the zombies even to the point that they must bear the consequences and be bitten.The four live so in this mall, knowing that it's not forever, but they would probably stay there for ever likes. You have there for the next time everything in abundance. Even money, if there should be some way out of the zombie plague is in the box office around en masse. But it is also a life into the day. You do not know today what tomorrow is, they can not plan anything, and the idyll of the mall, or even life itself may be over almost every day. By then as the biker gang, about Tom Savini (Special FX technician of the film) rushes to the mall, the viewer knows that the film will be found soon to an abrupt end.Because of the many factors that show the ""Dawn of the Dead"" is everything, but not of violent film, it is incomprehensible to me how this film can still lead to the blacklisting of the seizure. The brutality is still not without but not nearly as sadistic as in today's horror films of the type of hostel. Sure, Romero shows a lot of eating zombies gnaw at the bones and entrails eat what is quite nasty in places, but a 18er since release should be perfectly adequate. But the vexing issue of the German ""Jungendschutzes"" of the adults in front of such films is ""protected"" well known to all.Finally, a few remarks on pure cinematic aspect. There is also the film of a few changes in the international versions. For Europe, the Italian director Dario Argento made a ""Euro-Cut"" to, well based on this review and which is seen by many people as the best version. Romero himself, this version was too action-oriented. Romero has made the United States, two other versions section. U.S. Theatrical Cut as well as his own director's cut. Are the two versions as well as the Argento Cut it to a great U.S. DVD from Anchor Bay. In Germany you get the uncensored film to buy only on film stock. There are usually department stores in the so-called ""revised long version"" that runs longer than the Argento cut and about as long as the director's cut of Romero, but was reduced significantly in all the scenes of violence. Touches on what versions of this cut I do not know.A mention should also mention the soundtrack of the movie, because this is also great. Catchy melodies that underscore the scenes well. This was created by Goblin (an Italian band) and Dario Argento.Who knows the movie is not so far should look at him in any case strongly once. You may need a dose of nostalgia, because the zombies look sometimes quite strongly for actors. I enjoyed this but nothing at all. Who knows just the remake of 2004, will be be surprised at the original and maybe even find it boring.

494,marko_radojevich,One of my favourite films,10,29 July 2004,"I have seen this movie a long time ago, as a kid, and I feel a very strong attachment to it. Therefore, my love of it probably affects my objectivity as a critic of it. That being said - I know that this may not be an entirely perfect film, but I have yet to see one that will invoke in me the feelings of such magnitude. The wonderfully paced story, slowly rising from the heartbeat-tempo of the opening music into the apocalyptic feeding frenzy at the end, the flawless lighting, angles and camera work, all make the atmosphere absolutely involving, almost hypnotizing.When I saw this movie for the first time (and many times subsequently), there came a point when I felt entirely drawn into the story...watching it , fearing for the protagonists, feeling as though I was actually right there with them, completely unaware of my surroundings. Now, a movie that can do that is surely a masterpiece.I still have not found a single movie in any genre that can rival it in the sheer scope of atmosphere it creates.Hollywood can learn a lot from movies like this one. Its strongest point lies in its realism, even I would say - modesty of presentation, deceptive simplicity...there are no overdone special effects or flashy characters...just a presentation of everyday world, ever so subtly kicked askew. And that's wherein its wonder lies. This story is a fantasy. Over-the-top grizzly. Absurd. And you WILL believe it. Watch this movie. You may like it, you may not. But I am sure that it will enrich you in some way. It's just to powerful a vision to experience with indifference. Even so many years after my first viewing, I am still left with the echoes of that world that's gone mellow, slow and lethargic, where our civilization is only a memory and the dead walk the earth as a reminder to the living.",Dawn of the Dead
495,cavknightofJesus,This movie breaks through many walls!!,10,4 September 2004,"Being a ""dead"" fan for some time now, I found that George Romero's Dawn of the Dead was masterfully done. Even though some of the zombies make up jobs weren't as detailed as ""day of the dead"", the story line was outstanding, and I still haven't seen anything as awesome as Tom Savini's ""head shot"" scene...that was excellent! The way that Romero used all virtually ""unknown"" actor/actresses (not superstars anyway, though their acting in the film as very good.) and how the group grew together on screen was impressive. I thought that the SWAT assault on the apartment complex needed some further detail, but in my opinion this was the only thing that I saw that could be improved.",Dawn of the Dead
496,deep_fried_chicken,"Clever, gory, satirical.",10,31 October 2004,"Dawn of the Dead centres around a ragtag group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse who find sanctuary in a shopping mall. Whereas the initial context of the movie is obviously gore mingled with sarcastic humour, the film contains a very subtle subplot: what happens when society is non-existent? when there is no law or justice? You ride around in a big bike gang raiding, looting, stealing, and sometimes getting feasted on by the undead. Ha ha ha. The acting for the most part is quite see through, but I think this adds to the almost B-movie feel of the whole thing. You'll also find that the zombie make-up effects are poor, (faces painted blue, however this is due to a low budget) but the quality of the gore, as proved in the final fifteen or so minutes of the film, will make most squeam. Overall, a brilliant fusion of comedy, gore and satire. Look out for the zombie enjoying the leg!",Dawn of the Dead
497,chris-george-anderson,Still to this day the greatest Zombie movie of all time,10,15 June 2020,Dawn of the Dead is George Romero's sequel to his 1968 cult classic 'Night of the living Dead'. Such a simple story about 4 survivors seeking refuge in a shopping mall during a world wide zombie epidemic. This film to this day is still my favourite zombie movie of all time. This film really has everything.,Dawn of the Dead
498,GuyFromDK,Worst movie I've seen? Yes!,1,6 February 2005,"I don't understand how this movie can be rated to highly. Maybe it has got a large cult following? That must be it! Anyway, don't be fooled by the high ratings, this movie is rubbish from start to end! I starts with an annoying scene set in a TV studio. It's just chaos! It then switches to a scene where a SWAT team storms a building without any explanation. From the start, it's clear that ""acting"" is very bad i this movie! Also, the zombie make-up and blood just looks stupid! There's no horror here. As I watched this movie (I had to turn it off two times because it was so boring), I found myself sitting in disbelief with an open mouth wondering what on earth the director and script writer had been thinking. Everything just seems stupid and without reason. Take the scene where the two SWAT guys race around the parking lot in vans while ""flyboy"" is circling overhead in his helicopter. There's no explanation for this scene whatsoever. What were they doing racing around in the parking lot? Why was the helicopter overhead? Got no clue! At a point during the last 15 minutes, the whole thing becomes so surrealistic and bad that it's almost funny. But make no mistake. This is not fun! This is terrible, and one of the worst movies ever! The only good thing to be said about this movie is, that it spawned a remake in 2004 which is actually pretty good!",Dawn of the Dead
499,Daryl-Dixon,One of the Best,10,22 December 2015,"Dawn of the Dead is without a doubt one of the best movies of the horror genre. Brilliantly directed by George A. Romero, this movie has a lot of atmosphere and social commentary, namely consumerism in the good old US of A.There have been some complaints that I have heard that need to be addressed.First off, some people complain that the walkers ain't scary because of bad make-up effects (blue paint). Well the reason for this is because the gray make-up that Tom Savini used to make them up photographed blue for some reason (cheap cameras?). Same complaint with the orange blood. If this bothers you, I highly suggest watching the Divimax DVD version as it seems they digitally made the walkers and blood look MUCH better and realistic.On to the story. Four survivors hiding from the walking dead in a shopping mall. What's not to love? They eventually clear the shopping center and attempt to live out the remainder of their lives there but, as usual, bad people screw it up. The climax will have you on the edge of your seat.To sum it all up, if you haven't seen this masterpiece, watch it as soon as possible!",Dawn of the Dead
500,choclizard,Analysis of a classic,9,24 May 2008,"WARNING: CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS Some films entertain us, some scare us and some try to tell us something about ourselves. Few achieve all three convincingly, especially in the horror genre. Over the years zombies and the apocalypse have been done to death. So why does this film still feel so fresh and vibrant some 30 years later? Mainly because of the vision of its director, George A Romero. Working with a low budget, he had complete artistic freedom. He explored themes of isolation and greed, and with its fully fleshed out characters and graphic violence was able to show the American dream descending into nightmare. It veered from being comedic to dark and bleak, but there were also unexpected moments of sorrow and poignancy. It was not particularly scary in a conventional sense. There were few jump out of your seat moments. But what it did have, and still does, was an uncanny way of drawing you in, seeping into your consciousness and infecting your dreams, with repeated viewings especially.Firstly, and probably most importantly, Romero wasn't interested in why the dead were rising. There were cursory and conflicting explanations throughout the whole of his dead series. In this film though we were told ""When there's no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the Earth"", and by the time we heard it we could believe it. Some reviewers complained that the slow-moving zombies with their bluish-green makeup and glazed over expressions just weren't scary. That, to me, missed the whole point Romero was trying to make. It was exactly that ordinariness; the recognisability of the people they once were that gave them their power. Most people wouldn't have a problem shooting a snarling monster, but when that monster looks like your friend, neighbour, lover it is a different matter. We are shown throughout the movie, but especially in the early scenes that that was how zombies could overrun us. By the time the characters accepted that, it was too late.Secondly, Romero was able to break taboos and showed us things we hadn't seen in horror films before. Most of the film took place in daylight, a real first at the time. Children became zombies in this film and were gunned down with hardly a second thought. People were literally ripped to pieces. With his almost documentary approach, he used media reports on the television and radio to show that those in charge had no easy solutions. We got a real sense that society was collapsing before our eyes. It was a shock to see how fast anarchy took over.Some people complained about the acting in this film. It was far from faultless, but the performances from the leads, Ken Foree in particular, were convincing. Suspension of disbelief is very important in this type of film, but all the protagonists acted logically given the world they were in. We got to like the characters and, by the end, we were willing those remaining to survive.The musical score too perfectly suited the carnage on screen. Goblin's pounding rock really added to the tension.For me though, there were some small scenes in this movie that really set it apart from others. Real directorial flourishes that kept me immersed in that world and just kept coming back to me. Even now I don't fully understand why.As the helicopter first took off at night, the lights in an office block behind it gradually switched off one by one.Stephen in an office above the mall. As he planned his first journey to join Roger and Peter below he looked almost directly into the camera. There was no musical cue but if you looked closely a solitary zombie could be seen silently crossing the room behind him.The radio narration that explained why zombies weren't cannibals, cut to images of them shuffling aimlessly through the mall.As blood was wiped from the truck windscreen, we witnessed Roger's descent into something approaching madness, which was to cost him dearly.Peter alone at dawn as he played squash on the roof of the mall. He knocked a ball over the edge and the camera followed it down to the car park below where it landed next to a corpse.Fran as she skated alone on the ice rink.Target practice on the ice rink.Fran sat up, smoking a cigarette in bed as the camera slowly panned back from her face.Stephen's first appearance as a zombie.The final shot of the helicopter that carried the survivors to an uncertain future.Romero followed this classic with the much darker and almost criminally under-rated Day of the Dead in 1985. Along with Dawn's predecessor, Night of the Living Dead, that completed his dead trilogy. Until In 2005, after years in the directorial doldrums Romero was able to secure enough funding to give us Land of the Dead. That was backed by a major studio, and whilst mildly entertaining on a superficial level it lacked the wit and artistry of his earlier films. With its evolving zombies, one-dimensional characters and CGI gore it just didn't feel right. It looked like it was filmed on a studio back-lot. The best comparison I can make is that Land is to Dawn or Day what John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars is to his Halloween or The Thing.Even worse was to come with 2007's Diary of the Dead; a film so woeful that, with the exception of the fabulous opening scene, part of me refuses to believe Romero wrote or directed it at all.Rumours abound that yet another dead film may be in the pipeline. I doubt Romero will ever be able to capture the highs of Dawn again, but that doesn't stop me hoping.",Dawn of the Dead
501,andrewmford,More than just a zombie film,10,29 March 2015,"I remember when I first saw this movie. It was towards the end of eight grade, and I found the VHS lying around in my grandpa's basement. I was a big fan of Night of the Living dead, so naturally I wanted to watch it. I had absolutely no idea of what to expect from it, other than it took place in a mall, had zombies, and was full of blood.At this point in my life I had really only seen mainstream Hollywood movies and giant monster movies. The most gruesome films I had seen prior to this was Predator and Night of the Living Dead. Needless to say, even though I watched this on a 13 inch TV on VHS, this film completely blew my mind. The film was a bit too gruesome for me the first time I watched and frequently looked away at the more gruesome bits. However, I loved every minute of it. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I was completely engrossed by the story and was on the edge of my seat during the last act of the movie.I've seen this movie over a dozen times since then, and this has only deepened my appreciation of this movie. Although, one thing have noticed is that some of the gore shots are almost subliminal as some appear on screen for less than a second. It's only gotten funnier with each viewing, and the humor only makes the film more compelling. Also, the performances of the main characters are top notch. I also love the over the top performances of the people being interviews on the news. Romero also gives them great material to work with and never betrays the characters by having them do something stupid just to make the movie progress. The main characters in this movie are smart, but still prone to mistakes. Unlike in most horror movies, which they're just plain dumb.And of course, all of the music in the film is excellent from the ominous Goblin score to the cheese of the stock tracks. They blend together perfectly and perfectly fit the tone of the film. The blood is incredibly fake looking, and the zombies look cheap, but generally the gore effects are great.Perhaps, the best part of this movie is that it completely spits on mall culture on comparing mall shoppers to zombies. Especially, since malls are an intellectual vacuum that only attract the painfully shallow and thinking impaired.Lastly, I personally love the visuals of the film. It looks like a cheap grind house movie from the 70's (which it is), but it's also shot with such style and the editing gives the film such energy. The film runs over two hours, but there's never a dull moment. I, of course urgently recommend that you view this film intermediately. This film is more than just a simple zombie movie, it's a work of art that will stand the test of time. This is the movie that got me into underground movies, and it's the movie that lead me down the path to becoming a filmmaker. I doubt the film will effect you as strongly as it did me, but you definitely watch this classic if only to see how it basically influenced everything zombie related that came out after it.",Dawn of the Dead
502,kirbis007,This reminds me of the time that milk came out of my nose while laughing at how bad this movie was,3,1 July 2005,"Wow, where shall i begin? Firstly I would like to lead this off by saying that I do own this movie. Even though I rate it as a 3/10, I still own this movie. The only reason I did happen to go buy this movie is because it makes me laugh so hard it makes me hurt my spleen. Despite the fact that a lot of people have been saying this movie is a masterpiece because of all the ""social commentaries"" and other artistic things like that, this movie was just plain bad. Just because you make a pale blue shaded Harry Krishnah(or however you spell it) try to eat someone, it doesn't make the movie a masterpiece.I would usually make a checklist for a zombie movie like this.Acting--x---not there in the least. Any sort of remotely good effects--x---the funniest part of the movie. Story Line--x---Zombies invaded...Again!!!! Social Commentaries--(Big Check!!!)---Because these are what everyone goes to the movies for!! Give me a break.I would have voted this movie a 1 but if a movie makes me laugh as hard as this one did I do think it deserves a little tiny shred of credit. So if you're looking for a good laugh then just go look for the 1978 classic(why it's a classic, you'll just have to see for yourself), Dawn of the Dead.3/10",Dawn of the Dead
503,hdagelic,"sadistic, evil and boring",1,17 May 2008,"I don't know what empty head can call this movie good. It's no horror because it isn't scary at all, it's just sadistic and evil. The whole plot is that a couple of ""hunters"" are enjoyng their hunt on people; shooting, blowing their brains off and running them over with trucks. I don't know what stupid and sick mind can film a child murder... I guess that's because he has no imagination and has to make an effect that way. And yes, what idiot can think of saying 'do you want to abort it - i know how' out of the blue when somebody says his wife is pregnant.All of that killing is justified by the fact that they're killing zombies.

504,ezreviews,its not bad!,4,25 May 2019,"Much of this movie has a carefree, whimsical tone uncharacteristic of the zombie genre, and there are a few fun moments which do add a lot of flavor. And of course yes yes the movie makes comments on American culture and consumerism...However, I feel there was much that could have been cut out. (To be fair though I did watch the Extended Mall Hours version.) Most of the dialogue and action in the chaos of the beginning is quite unintelligible and noisy. In fact I'm fairly confident you could actually go without audio for the first 30 minutes and not lose anything. The makeup and special effects, especially when compared with the 2004 remake, really do not hold up and are to say the least extremely unfortunate... The main characters weren't particularly interesting, and I found the rednecks and bikers to be much more memorable.If you are looking for an alternative to sleep medication or hoping to lower your blood pressure in honor of that one biker, I do recommend playing this movie softly in the background, as it put me to sleep during my first attempt watching.",Dawn of the Dead

What's not to like? Plenty of gore, tons of action sequences, tight pacing and characters to care about. Sure, the social commentary is a little ham-fisted, but so what? Most mainstream films are soulless nuggets that are instantly forgettable. Romero has made a film that remains relevant almost 30 years after its release.

Catharsis is usually a weak point of horror film, but Dawn of the Dead not only makes us want to care about the four flawed, sometimes petty central characters, it also encourages us to feel for the enemy -- the zombies who are abused by the bikers and then the bikers, violent stereotypes as they are, who get devoured by the zombies near the end.",Dawn of the Dead

I mean, if someone dies, he becomes a zombie, its fine... But, how come did various people die at the same time (baseball player, a nurse, a priest...) what happened to them, is that some kind of disease, or so popular case of radiation which can explain every single thing in such movies, but still explain nothing, or what? Have they come from the hell through a portal? If so, why there is 90% of young people, and you can hardly notice old fellas...

530,Tomwsmith,One of the best apocalyptic horror films ever made!,10,31 December 2001,"When I first taped this film I was so obsessed with it I watched it 4 times the following day! Right at the start of the film there's apocalypse style panic and chaos because the zombie crisis is way out of control. When the priest says ""You are stronger than us, or so I think, they be stronger than you!"" summarizes the situation well.The film could have begun at the scene where the main characters arrive at the mall, instead George Romero builds up our respect and sympathy for them so you care when they are in a situation of extreme danger and when  a tragedy occurs. In too many horror films there's little or no character building. Its not really terrifying, its more of a thriller than a horror film.  Some parts of the film are very tense but there are plenty of scenes when the clumsy zombies and and a few bits of funny dialogue that make you laugh.It also has social commentary thats not usually  in horror films. The scenario of the zombies desperately wanting to get into the mall represents the out of control, mindless (zombie like) consumerism in the US.  I loved the mall music (although a bit irritating) and the soundtrack by Goblin in the film which is far superior to the diabolical soundtracks to other films.The few aspects that I didn't like were the zombie's movements in the film which were occasionally too humanlike and the scenes with unnecessary graphic violence and gruesome special effects made the film less watchable than it could have been but that aside its a masterpiece. Its well directed and the acting is great with excellent performances form the four main actors.. I Recommend it to any serious film fan, even if they don't like horror! 9.5/10",Dawn of the Dead
531,mstrmurder,Bad but good,7,24 March 2009,"I rented this film out of sheer boredom and i had heard a lot of good stuff about it. Well i watched it and was fairly disappointed, but after a couple of days i tried it again. There is just so much wrong with this film. Countless errors, bad effects (i know it was 1978), bad props, mediocre acting,horrible music, many scenes which were added because they could and contributed nothing to the film. But still, there's something about it i love. The story is great and the way it shows how humanity can spiral out of control from being in isolation is unforgettable. There are some good underlying metaphors and messages in this film if you read deep enough. I think there is room for this film to be very accurately remade just to do it justice with some better effects and a higher budget, not like Zack Snyder's. My advice is watch this film, but be prepared to dislike a lot about it.",Dawn of the Dead
532,jmwallace84,"Zombies eat people, all is good in the world of horror.",8,26 February 2008,"I remember first viewing this zombie classic back around 1998 and I remember that not too many people knew about it then it seemed. Over the years, thanks to word of mouth, much of it over the internet, the movie became pretty popular. Dawn of the Dead has become such a classic that they made a remake of it in 2004, which was superb in and of itself, especially considering that remakes usually blow. This is my favorite horror movie. But is it scary? Not, not really, but it's creepy and has everything that I, personally like in a horror movie: people being killed in gruesome ways, dark humor, interesting characters, and zombies- I love zombies... a lot. I wrote that this movie was creepy and not scary. There aren't any scenes that will make you jump out of your seat or scream, but there are disturbing scenes that make you feel uneasy inside. My favorite creepy feeling is the end of the world thought and that nothing will ever be the same, I like the hopelessness involved with those thoughts. Perhaps one of the reasons I like zombie movies so much, particularly the Romero zombie movies, is that the monsters are people that were once living, but are now trying to eat every person they come in contact with. From the main character's perspective, the zombie could be someone they cared about, but now it's an instinct driven machine ready to devour it's former loved ones. The biggest antagonists in the movie turn out to be humans and not zombies, of course. In the beginning we are introduced to two of the main characters, members of a Philadelphia S.W.A.T. team doing a raid on a housing project where the residents are keeping the dead, because they ""Still believe there is respect in dying."" As a bloodbath ensues, our characters Roger and Peter decide to run with Roger's friend, a traffic reporter with a helicopter and his pregnant girlfriend. Another bloodbath at the end involves a biker gang that raids the mall where the group had been holding up, but I won't discuss that as it would contain spoilers. Perhaps the most famous aspect of this movie is it's social commentary, when the group first arrives at the shopping center, it's infested with mindless zombies endlessly roaming the mall looking for things to consume, just as if the group had came there on a regular shopping day. Also, after the mall has been cleared and secured, the group lives the high life for several months with everything they need in the mall and right at their fingertips, but they break down and become depressed and lonely. A sad, but perhaps very accurate depiction of our consumer culture.",Dawn of the Dead
533,rogerdemarco30,The Best Movie Ever Made!!!,10,21 June 2013,"Anyone that likes zombie movies should be familiar with the follow up to the ground-breaking classic, ""Night of the Living Dead"". I actually consider to be the best movie ever made. For anyone that might ask why, please let me explain. The four main characters (Peter, Fran, Stephen, and Roger) are fully fleshed out and are easy to identify with. Director George Romero helped spear-head realistic performances from each of the actors, which was no easy task considering the movie is essentially a comic book fantasy come to life. The special effects still hold up well, due to the creativeness of Tom Savini, and are way better than the majority of work being done today. Each of the actors portraying the featured and background zombies should be commended, as each one of them is unique in their own way. The story is phenomenal, because it is bolstered by a time-line that not many zombie movies utilize. The movie deals with the fall of civilization, where as most movies either deal with the initial outbreak, or a scenario where mankind has already fallen. Check the movie out and I'm sure that you will agree with most of my points.",Dawn of the Dead
534,lokus-art-652-876955,"Zombies like this movie, that's why it's rated so high",1,5 September 2015,"Dawn of the Dead is considered these days a cult movie, quite difficult to talk about zombie movies without someone mentioning its title and while mentioning it, they also talk some wonderful things about it. Why? That's a mystery I would like to know...From a nonsensical plot, followed by the nonsensical actions of its characters, I would say ""Dawn of the Dead"" is one of those movies which remain on top, only by a blind cult following. I even considered that the ratings were so high because of zombies going to theaters, that's a probability, but going back to the plot.During the movie we can find several example of things that just don't feel right, like scenes of actors playing zombies, smiling at the camera like they were having a great time; the great idea of storing the rotten bodies of zombies in the same fridge room with the food supply (...what a great idea bro!); having an armory store full of weapons and ammunition and still having a hard time fighting zombies that move less than 1 mile/h; the stereotypical remark of the Mexican guy with the mariachi sombrero (what a fail...), and by the way, do they know what locking the doors to remain safe means??? I think a SWAT member would know that, well... at least two would know.Concluding, I recommend you to watch the film, who knows... you probably like it, if you do so, please just check yourself in front of a mirror, if you have so gray-blueish paint splattered on your face, you must be a zombie. Now serious, I recommend you to watch ""The Night of the Living Dead"" instead, ""The Night of the Living Dead"" is truly a master piece on the genre, ""Dawn of the Dead"" just doesn't live to its reputation, in other words... it's just dead.",Dawn of the Dead
535,msegundo1974,The Greatest Zombie Movie of them all,10,27 June 2015,"I absolutely love this movie! My opinion might be a little biased due to the fact that I believe the 70's is the best decade when it comes to horror movies. Back in the day when JC Penney sold candy & Hare Krishnas hung out in airports...George A Romero, Dario Argento & Tom Savini made the greatest zombie movie ever. Blue zombies, pie fights, a shopping spree at the Mall, what more could you want in a movie, plus Savini was truly showcasing his talent in gore. The head being blow off, the helicopter chop top and the machete to the head scenes were awesome and way better than any of today's lame CGI crap. The soundtrack is really good too, Goblin put together some creepy music to go along with the movie. I appreciate this movie so much that I own both the Blu Ray version and the four disc Ultimate Edition.",Dawn of the Dead
536,markc75,The movie that made me a horror snob,10,18 September 2004,"There's not much I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said! I first saw it as a 13 year old in 1988 when I was at a stage where I was addicted to horror movies. What was different about Dawn of the Dead was that I actually cared about the characters and wanted to see them make it. I remember watching it in my living room in broad daylight with my hand in front of my face just in case I felt the need to cover up. Years later George Romero is still my favorite filmmaker, although I do blame him for turning me into a horror snob! After watching this master at work it's hard to watch other horror movies without thinking how weak the plots or lame the characters are. There are definitely exceptions, like Evil Dead, Re-Animator and the first Phantasm, but again, they're the exception, not the rule. If you're just discovering George Romero, maybe as a result of the Dawn remake, you owe it to yourself to check out Martin, Knightriders and Day of the Dead.

539,roi88,The Greatest shopping Experience Ever!!,10,12 August 2012,"When I first saw ""Dawn of the Dead,"" back in 1986, I found it to be a huge disappointment. I loved the original ""Night of the Living Dead,"" and ""Dawn"" was like a gory second cousin in living color. Remember that I was a teenager at the time and was a big fan of Freddy Krueger (still am). But watching ""Dawn of the Dead"" recently for the first time in almost twenty years, I was amazed at how much I missed. ""Dawn of the Dead"" is a comic horror film, full of satirical touches and director George Romero's own fiery theme of man's inhumanity to man and dead men.The film does begin rather unevenly. The setting is a TV station (the only one presumably on the air) where the host is arguing back and forth with his guest over the zombies - they are everywhere and are turning the nation into zombies. How can we stop them? Can we study them, perhaps to find what drives the urge to eat humans? The scene is a study in chaos and paranoia, as we also hear the rumblings from the TV crew watching the host and the guest argue vehemently. To make matters worse, the military is in the building (or so I thought - the editing is haphazard but maybe that is the point), and they are busily wiping out every zombie by shooting them in the head. Eventually, after witnessing ten minutes of quick shootings and the rumblings of a priest with a wooden leg, four survivors take off in a helicopter and land on the roof of a shopping mall. All is fine and dandy until they realize that the entire mall is flooded with zombies! So how do you manage to take whatever you want from a mall while fending off zombies who are fascinated by elevators and do a lot of window shopping? ""Dawn of the Dead"" has several moments of gore delicately crossed with brazen black humor. The film is a satire of consumerism, and what better place to consume and shop than a shopping mall? The zombies are drawn to this place because they feel they have been there before (and they like to consume as well), and I only wish that director George Romero pursued this idea further. If a zombie can recollect a specific memory by being in a familiar setting, can they think? If so, what channels it? And if they can think, can they see that maybe human flesh is not something to consume? Well, I just posed some existential questions here which Romero may not have thought of, but they went through my mind while watching this film. Most fans of the film will say that this a graphic geek show, designed to entertain and scare the bejesus out of you. It is that, and Romero has successfully managed to do so. But the setting of the film brings other questions to mind, considering this is not a nonstop avalanche of gore. The human survivors of the film stay at the mall for a long period of time, enough time to convert the dressing rooms into bedrooms. They even have a living room and a kitchen - it all looks like an advertisement for ""Good Housekeeping."" The dawn of America, Romero seems to say, is that the survivors of the Apocalypse will focus on living the good life of rich foods, TV, clothes, and all in great quantities, of course. Oh, and it helps to be armed and ready. The zombies are merely interested in consuming human flesh. ""Dawn of the Dead"" is often brilliantly unnerving, fitfully gory and offhandedly scary, using a perfectly bland setting where you would never expect zombies to scour the regions of something so sacred to the American consumer. The ending goes on a bit too long (particularly after seeing Tom Savini, the king of gory makeup, as a motorcycle rebel), and the characters never truly come alive beyond being caricatures with glints of humanity. I must add that you still care enough about them to hope they make it out of the mall alive. Still, ""Dawn of the Dead"" has a purpose and it fulfills it to a tee - to scare you and to gross you out. It does those things as well as any director could, but it is clear that George Romero has much more on his",Dawn of the Dead

Also, this is a great commentary on america's obsession of consumerism. The actors are very good, of course they are not name recognized actors but they do their job admirably.  Also, it has the awesome make up effects of tom savini, who also has a small role in the film.  Another thing I like about it is the music, it perfectly sums up the insanity of their situation.

542,Clerk2001,One good zombie movie,9,12 April 2004,"I, until recently, thought all hope was lost in the horror genre. i watched house of 1000 corpses and it lead me to watch many old horror movies. I was lost, until the remake of this fine classic was released. I rushed to the video store to rent the 78' version, but only in failure. That is when i decided i must make a purchase. I wandered around in best buy for an hour trying to decide ""74' TCM or 78' Dawn"" I asked a few of the employees, but they were a bunch of now help morons who only wanted to sell me the new TCM. I then picked up Dawn, rushed to the register, flew home like banshee. and then sat in amazement for the following two hours. When the movie was over i sat in amazemnt, went to bed, went to work, and when i got home i watched it again. the following day the same thing again with the directors commentary on. This is one zombie movie that does the genre some justice. Night was alright, but Dawn is now on my list of favorite horror movies just under House of 1000 corpses, and just above Nightmare on elm street. I know the number two spot does no justice to the movie at all, but it is slowly rising the more and more i watch it. each time i watch it i get so excited, always imaging what i would do if zombies were after me, but anyway that isnt important, what is important is shoot them in the head and find a good hiding spot.",Dawn of the Dead

I didn't know that this movie would get me hooked on the zombie genre forever. The special effects are amazing (for 1978 at least). On that note, this movie is unbelievably gory. Anyone who grows faint at the sight of blood shouldn't go anywhere near this movie without about fifty barf bags. The acting is very good. You really get to know the characters after a while.

I used to think that the pink blood detracted from the film's effect, but now I see it as adding to the whole comic book tone.  Nothing has topped this film, and nothing ever will.  Its a rare type of film :a critically loved, meaningful horror film. The characters are people that you actually care for, and when one of them becomes a victim, you actualy feel sad about it.  And the whole consumerism theme has only grown with age, as we now live in an age where the shopping mall is where people go to shop and to hang out almost every day.

546,gumbroski-1,Possibly the best horror movie of all time,10,5 April 2004,"Before I submit a review let me establish some credentials .. Ive seen 5,000 plus movies, have been a collector for almost 20 years, and ran a collectors store for four - so if my opinion is not shared then at least it should have some frame of reference. Now the movie - first off this movie came along at exactly the right time - slap bang in he middle of an exciting time in movies and certainly at the peak of the horror genre. And it is a lot to do with this that all the elements work ... locations , budget (and budgetary restrictions) - i.e make up effects over CGI and substance and characters over star billing... and the movie just somehow triumphs on all levels. I cannot think of anything more watchable over and over again. We all know the plot - the world population is decimated by a plague virus which turns the recently dead into flesh eating zombies .. yeah not for all tastes but it manages to  turn this wacky plot into something so believable and something so committed that it succeeds on all levels required to transcend the genre and give it accessibilty to a mainstream audience. ALSO , its real important to watch the whole 140 minute plus version which fleshes out the characters and voyeuristic scenes of running around in a world without restrictions of law and order ...and the movie does this in spades. We the audience are taken through a chaotic beginning, a ponderous and fascinatingly liberating middle and a climax with tragic and triumphant elements. From the TV station and apartments blocks in the first 30 and the fuelling station and countryside segments to the glorious monroeville mall ...Romero shows us a bleak view of the pessimistic circumstances that the main characters face and utilises some of the best locations imaginable to create his masterpiece. Add to this a Goblins score which fits like a glove to the mood of the photography and action. Faultless ? .. not quite , the last quarter which sees the fort knox like mall breached by bikers spoils the party for the protagonists and to a small extent the viewer, although its hard to identify what lets this section down .. maybe the lack of comradeship between the survivors ... maybe the lack of character amongst the bikers ... or maybe the viewer just doesnt want to see someone spoiling the party. The finale however satisfies, although brief, it brings everything full circle and manages to balance the pessimism with a final glimmer of hope and leaves us all guessing. Unfortunately due to financial restrictions Day of the Dead could not properly follow things up - it would have been the hardest task in the history of the genre to cap this one.... forget the remake - watch this and see a horror movie which cannot be equalled",Dawn of the Dead

This is my go-to favorite zombie movie, when I'm in the mood for a modern zombie movie that feels like it could happen today. While Night of The Living Dead is awesome in its own right, it's a different, highly atmospheric and psychological thriller that feels more like a nightmare. DOTD, on the other hand, feels like the ultimate role-play in a modern zombie apocalypse scenario. George Romero is the best at this, and this is his best movie, period. And as always in his films, he accomplishes the excellent end result with a cast of unknowns (tell me another Director who does this when they don't have to). George is supported by Tom Savini's outstanding special effects and a cameo to remember.Enjoy this harrowing adventure of a survivalist group that shores up a shopping mall for supplies and a sanctuary from the zombie onslaught outside.

Having been born in 1982 I just found that I had a hard time getting past the tacky mall, the ugly clock tower, and the way things were setup. After knowing what to expect in that regard I just feel in love with this movie. I discovered that the acting wasn't all that bad, the make-up was genius, the filming location is legendary and I seem to be a huge George A. Romero follower now. Good news too, I'm not alone.

554,arcy26,Dawn of the Dead isn't your typical horror film...,10,13 December 2012,"Why am I so fascinated by this movie? Well, lets just say its probably the only movie that scared the living crap out of me. I remember begging my father in the movie theater in the late seventies to take me home because I couldn't bare to watch the gore. I actually used to hate this movie until I viewed it again in the early eighties and was blown away by its cleverness. It's a brilliant comic book. The masterpiece visualizes in garishly bright red blood shadowing the 1950s EC comics. Dawn of the Dead isn't you typical horror film. There's a message in every George A. Romero Dead film that can't be ignored. Everybody leaves their seats on a full stomach... Dawn of the Dead is the second installment of Romero's Legendary DEAD series.. Starting with Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Land of the Dead, a belated reflection post- 911 , Diary of the Dead. A brilliant commentary on the media where everyone is a film producer. Hence: YouTube. And now, Survival of the Dead, a zombie apocalyptic western remake of William Wyler's The Big Country with a little dash of Looney Tunes . Night is pretty much the introduction mirroring the Vietnam war, rioting in the streets and racial differences of the sixties, Dawn, unlike the 2004 inferior remake took the next step forward into an ambiguous desensitizing society, social reverent satire of American Consumerism of the seventies. Day pretty much focused on how ""we"" lack communication and refuse to cooperate with each other. The scientific investigators trying to domesticate the problem. The Military force trying to muscle the problem and civilians trying to avoid it all and enjoy the rest of their natural lives. Land of the Dead focuses on terrorism and ignoring the problem. Dawn is the discotheque of the series but don't let that fool you. Dawn may have some silly moments but the under tones are taken seriously. The symbolism should be taken serious. Dawn focuses on four individuals trapped in a shopping mall where they have everything they can possibly dream of and want including, money, high fashion clothes, the best quality foods, cars, an arcade and a beauty salon and still the four aren't content. They are empty lacking something in their lives to fill-in the empty gaps. What are they looking for? The Human Nature. Now, that's art at its finest. The principal characters eventually take refuge at Monroeville Mall and isolate themselves from society and it's defects. It's ironic the protagonist become the very thing they abhor the most. The world. Eventually the dead will overthrow the living brutally devouring us alive. Lets face it. They don't make them like the used to.ARCY VOZ CAVALIER",Dawn of the Dead

When I first watched this, I was terrified, absolutely terrified, but there was something about the terror that truly intrigued me to watch it again. The second time I watched, I had to sit with every light on in the house, by my 5th time I was almost ready to watch it in its entirety alone in the dark. When I finally built up the courage and watched it through, I had this new found love & obsession with Horror movies. With this movie, my love for zombies was born. This movie had the power to turn a kid with a fear of Horror movies, into a zombie junkie. To me this is one of the perfect Horror movies. With so many versions available, I recommend breaking in with the 129 min. theatrical version then once you see that I am right in that it's one of the greatest Horror movies :), pick up the 'Ultimate Edition' box set.",Dawn of the Dead
557,theturningpoint03,Well Developed Film....,10,30 December 2004,"To Whom it may Concern ^I feel as if you are not exposed to the art of film making and what it takes to make the magic happen. If your such a horror fanatic how could you forget the original slasher of them all Leatherface.As I read your post, you recommend Jeepers Creepers as a good horror film? How lame and predictable was that film. Not even close to being a classic...It is not compared to DOTD. Not only has George A. Romero made a cult classic. The originality is to it's perfection in this one. Only Romero can make a true zombie horror movie work. All these new zombie movies coming out our knockoff Romero flicks. Romero's original script was absolutely incredible and Romero's talent to storyboard everything in his head is amazing. True horror fans our obsessed with the effects work done by Savini. Tom worked his ass off in this one and certainly made a name for himself as a visual effects artist. I think the reality that Tom put in this film is flawless and I feel it made it as real as it gets. For Tom being a Vietnam vet. I feel that he knows that the hell he is doing for what he's been through.Period point blank. This film is amazingly incredible for it's time and will perservere in time as well...",Dawn of the Dead
558,JumiiJima,Fun and disturbing at the same time,7,7 January 2005,"I saw ""Night of the Living Dead"" a few years ago and wasn't very impressed with it so I wasn't too excited to see the sequel ""Dawn of the Dead"" which I suspected to be just more of the same, boy was I wrong!The movie starts off on the wrong foot, the first 20 minutes are allover the place and ridiculously over the top. But once our 4 main characters get on the helicopter and begin their journey the movie really starts to get going. My favorite parts of the movie were surprising not the moments with the zombies but the quite scenes in between of our main characters building a small society for themselves and living life the best way that they can. My favorite scene in the movie is when one of the characters is playing Tennis on the top of the mall and accidentally knocks the ball off of the roof and the ball falls into a huge group of zombies. The ending was absolutely perfect as well.The movie is not without its faults though, the movie is certainly not timeless. There are some scenes that will make you laugh unintentionally, but its all in good fun. The movie has an absolutely HORRID score, I would like to see the movie with a different, more fitting score it would have helped build the atmosphere a lot better. Some the acting is so-so but its fitting, nothing that detracts from the performance.This movie will give you a silly smile on your face and gross you out at the same time, a great achievement by Romero.Rating: 7/10",Dawn of the Dead
559,SupaBladesMan04,This Is THE horror film of all time all in the space of 138 mins (the directors cut!!),10,8 January 2005,"This movie is excellent, i haven't actually seen the original Night Of The Living Dead, just the 1990 remake, but this film kicks ass on all zombie films even the most recent Resident Evil ones and I'm so excited about the release of Land Of The Dead, i think Romero makes this film and am so glad its him directing the next!! I Think Tom Savini did a great job on the special effects to say what equipment he had back them to use, and did a great job on the directing of the remake of Night Of The Living Dead. I have seen the remake to this movie and is nothing compared to this, i don't even see why its called Dawn Of The Dead its that different. But this is really a great film and every horror fan should have this in their DVD/VHS collection!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!",Dawn of the Dead
560,agentorange552,The gore just gets better....,10,19 October 2005,"The excellent follow up to George A. Romero's 1968 black and white classic 'Night of the Living Dead', 'Dawn of the Dead' is a sequel to this successful film. Set a short period of time after the rising of the dead in 'Night', the film focuses on four people fleeing before the zombie onslaught, eventually finding refuge in a giant shopping mall. All seems perfect until one fateful night...George A. Romero's sequel to 'Night', this film offers everything. From fast action, to scares, to, yes you guessed it, gore by the bucket load. Years after the release the film can still have a great impact, while the effects may be outdated they still make a powerful statement.While 'Night'was filmed in black and white, 'Dawn' is in full co lour. The central characters are likable, but like in all horror movies have their faults. The fast paced music, created by Italian horror maestro Dario Argento and Goblin, creates tension in the film in all the right places. The fast paced action is also something to be admired, a definite step up from 'Night'. The visual effects are also spectacular. Some may be put off by the blue faced zombies, but this simply adds to their scariness.'Dawn of the Dead' is definitely a recommended film and it is not necessary to watch the other films in the series (although I do recommend you do) to follow what is going on. Go out and watch it now! 10/10",Dawn of the Dead
561,kurtster98,The Ultimate in Survival Horror.........,10,13 July 2005,"Hey, what more could be said about the ""original"" Dawn??? First of all to this day it still stands out as the more scarier and gory ""original"" horror movies to this day, and that being said even outdoes the new ""Land of the dead"" in terms of just plain concept and reality factors.It doesn't matter which ""cut"" of this film you see it's just one of those movies that in all will just stick in your mind the rest of your life. Unlike 2004's Dawn, this one relies on sticking to the roots of a story by revolving around just 4 people, not 10 or so more so you never really lose any interest of the movie, even after the spectacular opening 22 1/2 minutes or so until the ""dock"" scene. Even the ending just makes you think also, ""what if?.......""",Dawn of the Dead
562,LouisWillDie,best zombie movie ever,10,16 October 2005,"Great movie much better than remake.Remake has nothing to do with Dawn excpt the fact that they take place in a mall.I love this movie because its gore even thoe cheesy at times.Blood in this movie has a sort of comic look.Color of the zombies skin is a blueish green look,unlike most white brown colored zombies.This movie also features a biker character who is repeated in the George A. Romareo's Land of the Dead.This movie created a splash of zombie movies all through the world. Creating the zombi series in Italy.This movie is a great movie a must have for any serious collector. But get the ultimate edition. If not a collector get the divermax version.Great movie would be a crime to skip.",Dawn of the Dead
563,knights3995,the mall,10,20 October 2005,"i think that this is without a doubt 1 of the greatest movies of all time!!....i love that mall!!I have been there for a day n a lot has changed in the interior of the mall but the outside is pretty much the same..JCpennys is the only store still there from the original movie, all of the others have been changed..the ice rink is now a food court n the clock tower isn't there anymore..but everything else is the same..u all should check it out 1 day..its called the Monroeville Mall n its about 5 miles south of Pittsburg, Pa.. if anyone had any information on what the ""BP"" symbol on the trucks that roger n peter used to block up the entrances please tell me",Dawn of the Dead
564,floydskater90,One of the best movies I've ever seen,10,7 January 2006,"George A. Romero nailed this one perfect. The intro was awesome, the mass hysteria and everyone fighting with each other was perfect. The news station was a replica of what it would be like if this really happened. Ken Foree and David Emge did amazing jobs, and for the low-budget and decent size crew, this movie became one of the top horror films of all time. The feeling of adventure when they reached the mall, and slowly taking it over for themselves, was a great plot. The bastard biker gang that invaded the mall after seeing the chopper on the roof got what was coming to them - having their limbs severed, their insides ripped out, and the little war was perfect. Please see this movie if , for some reason you have not. -Bob",Dawn of the Dead
565,Mark-Tee,The definitive zombie movie,9,5 February 2006,"Shopping in a mall is never the same after you've seen this movie! The characters - even the zombies - are well written. The zombies are not just threatening monsters but objects of compassion. It's the greatest Zombie flick of them all, but in my opinion the original theatrical release was superior to the director's cut (I don't think the original version is available on DVD). The restraint of the theatrical version made it much more realistic; the directors cut just added more gore which detracted from the main themes of the film. The 2004 remake was a bit of throwaway fun but awfully shallow in comparison. The only zombie films to come close are the original Night of the Living Dead and (funnily) Shaun of the Dead.",Dawn of the Dead
