0,MartinHafer,Horrible...but probably not deserving to be in the Bottom 100.,2,11 October 2018,"I have not seen any of the previous ""Scary Movie"" films. The reason why I chose to watch this one, the least financially successful and apparently worst one of them is that it has made it to the infamous Bottom 100 on IMDB....the lowest ranked major movies of all time. I have a weird desire to not only see tons of foreign and art films, but occasionally I love a bad film...particularly if they are unintentionally funny. In the case of ""Scary Movie 5"", it's a case of being unintentionally NOT funny!When the movie begins, you know you are in for a horrid film as the opening scene stars Lindsay Lohan and Martin Sheen! What follows is a very episodic film starring many C and D-list actors that parodies (or is supposed to parody) scary teen films and a variety of non-scary movies as well. During the course of the story there are jokes about weiners, drugs, feces, demonic possessions, vomit, farting, toilets and other intellectual subjects. These jokes are presented rapid-fire. Most fall pretty flat or are disgusting...and a few actually are funny...but only a few. Overall, this is a mostly unfunny movie starring many annoying actors....but, it is NOT so horrible that it deserves to be in the Bottom 100. Bottom 250...sure...but I can probably come up with at least 200 films worse than this mess...not that this is any sort of endorsement for you to watch it. If you do...don't say I didn't warn you!!",Scary Movie V
1,TheLittleSongbird,By far and away the worst of the series,1,17 July 2013,"The first Scary Movie was very entertaining if rather mindless, 2 is uneven though much better than what is often said about it, 3 was a mixed bag and 4 was poor and until now was the worst of the four. This fifth entry was just awful with no redeeming values, the only movie of the series to be on the same level as rubbish like Disaster Movie and Epic Movie and actually comes dangerously close to being even worse. Visually it's cheap, with the way it's shot and edited strongly reminiscent of a poorly done direct-to-video movie and that is the same with the sets. The soundtrack is generic and like a noisy music video with a lot thrown in for the sake of it and very little adds anything to what is going on. The dialogue toe-curlingly bad in how inane and excessively vulgar it is. Nothing about it is funny or witty, much of it is immature and insulting, if the writers were clueless as to what was funny that comes through loud and clear. The funniest it gets? ""Help, there's a mad demon in my house"", and if you're thinking that that is also stupid, you're right, it is. There is not much story here to speak of, it was just an excuse seemingly to cobble together genre send-ups and parodies and the sheer idiocy only increases. And none of these are funny, some of the gags are drawn out to an unbearable degree, the ones sending up horrors like Evil Dead have nothing atmospheric, scary or remotely creepy about them and the bulimia and pregnancy gags were tasteless(and not mildly, this is more above-borderline offensive, in quite some while no other movie has evoked a reaction as extreme as this). There's even a surreal spoof on Fifty Shades of Grey, which came across as out of place. The acting is awful, and even that is an insult to the word awful. It wasn't a problem that the original cast weren't there, what was was that none of the actors had any spirit and energy to their performances, the few actors who do have some talent are wasted and some overact, Ashley Tisdale being the worst offender. Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan send themselves and their tabloid reps embarrassingly, the Paranormal Activity spoof wasn't scary or halfway amusing in the slightest. In conclusion, a complete mess and by far the worst of an overall hit-and-miss movie series. 1/10 Bethany Cox",Scary Movie V
2,Leofwine_draca,Poor Zucker,3,9 July 2015,"David Zucker was the man responsible for some of the funniest spoofs of the 1980s - I'm thinking AIRPLANE! and the NAKED GUN trilogy - so it's sad to see how far his gravitas has fallen in working on the fifth instalment of a film series that was rubbish from the outset. The only good thing about SCARY MOVIE 5 is that Anna Faris isn't in it, which has to be a positive. Other than that, it's business as usual, with no story, tons of cameo appearances, and loads of lame, gross-out jokes.This film's opening scene, featuring Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan, is actually the funniest of the entire movie. It's a short spoof of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, and it plays out ridiculously over the top, as you'd expect, but it did make me laugh out loud. Unfortunately the film then shifts to a pair of uninteresting characters and virtually retells the plot of the horror flick MAMA while throwing in lots of other random spoofs along the way.This series has always had a scattershot approach so we get riffs on the likes of DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, EVIL DEAD, and even BLACK SWAN for random measure. The humour is always stupid and only a small handful of the jokes actually work. I guess with Marlon Wayans being out of the franchise the film-makers had to bring in a black 'street' presence, so we get Snoop Dogg in some random, extraneous sub-plot. Terry Crews, Jerry O'Connell, Mike Tyson, and Heather Locklear have cameos. Overall, I'd recommend changing the channel.",Scary Movie V
3,SnoopyStyle,what do you expect,3,13 October 2018,"Punk rocker Jody (Ashley Tisdale) and her ape researcher husband Dan (Simon Rex) are a happily childless couple. Their lives are turned upside down when Dan's lost nieces and baby nephew are found. Despite her objections, he eagerly takes them into their home. The former wild kids claim that they were being looked after by an entity called Mama. Jody has to abandon punk rock and follows her mother's career into ballet.It is exactly as one expects from the fourth sequel in the horror spoof franchise Scary Movie. It is much too scattered. It doesn't have Anna Faris. None of it rises to be funny. It would be more compelling to stay strictly with Mama even thought that movie isn't that popular or good. The Black Swan stuff is a waste. It would be well advised to fast forward sections of this movie.",Scary Movie V
4,nogodnomasters,Is there a cellar?,6,22 December 2017,"One of the nice things about this series is that the current film doesn't build upon previous installments. However, it is a spoof of other films which means you must have either seen those films, or have enough knowledge of them to enjoy this film.Number 5 builds primarily on the film ""Mama"" but also incorporates the Paranormal series, ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Black Swan,"" Madea, ""Evil Dead,"" Inception,"" and ""The Help,"" plus a few I might have missed. The Zucker humor in this film is no different than previous films relying in part on crudeness and slapstick.The best part of this film was the beginning as Charlie Sheen and Lindsey Lohan joke about their real life and have a sex scene out of a Benny Hill episode. Unfortunately they die after opening scene and do not appear again outside of some doctored up photos.This is not a film you must rush out and buy. It can wait for a price drop...like a 5 pack for $5.00.Parental Guide: F-bomb. Silly sex scene. Fake butt nudity. Fat woman in thong.",Scary Movie V
5,kosmasp,Starts off completely wrong aka Paranormal Mama,5,13 October 2013,"But maybe that is why in the end I kind of enjoyed some of it. Not the beginning bit, mind you! Even Charlie Sheen explaining that (which is the only thing worse than his skit/intro with Lohan) does not make it better. We get, the two of them are making fun of themselves. Not something that is particular funny though.The rest of the movie though: There are a few things, that were so silly that I had to laugh. Maybe it only makes sense or is kind of funny, if you have seen the other movies. Like ""Mama"" or ""Paranormal Activity"" which are the biggest influences here. If you have seen Haunted House (which I watched after Scary Movie 5) before you watch this, you might even like it more than I did. Regular Anna Faris is not back this time, but we get another actress who's doing a decent job of replacing. Though I guess if you were a fan of Farris, than you might be mad at her (not her fault though).By far not the best spoof I've seen, but if you let yourself to it (and be silly) this actually has some funny moments (don't let that stupid beginning ruin the whole movie for you).",Scary Movie V
6,Sleepin_Dragon,Don't expect much.,5,22 April 2019,"It's fair to say that it is the worst of the series, it's let down by some really awful scenes, and some dire performances, but, it still has some of the old magic, and a few times I did find myself laughing. The scene between Sheen and Lohan was perhaps the worst thing I have ever seen, it was appalling, almost like an attempt to replicate the Pamela Anderson scene, but it was just terrible. The Black Swan scenes were lots of fun, and nicely produced, they felt at odds with lots of the film.Is it the case that people's humour has changed since the early films, or were the jokes simply not funny? Personally I think it's the latter, in fairness though it isn't as if there were great horror movies to parody.It's poor, but will still give the odd chuckle. 5/10",Scary Movie V
7,jboothmillard,Scary Movie 5,1,27 August 2013,"I did used to like the Scary Movie films in a rather immature way, now only the first film is the one I can say good things about, because as they go on the sequels get worse and worse, and the spin off films from the same makers, e.g. Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie and Vampires Suck are abysmal, this was the fifth film in the now pointless continuing horror films, television and popularised celebrity news spoof series. This film predominantly parodies the ""found footage"", psychological and science-fiction horror and thriller films, specifically the Paranormal Activity series, Black Swan, Mama and Rise of the Planet of the Apes, as well as spoofing or referencing The Cabin in the Woods, Inception, Evil Dead, Fifty Shades of Grey, The Help, Insidious, Sinister, The Day the Earth Stood Still, 127 Hours and The Hunger Games. Basically the film opens with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan surrounded by many cameras in the bedroom to make a sex tape, the footage is sped to show them doing all sorts, and then an invisible force attacks them, and Lindsay becomes possessed and goes mental on camera, they were both killed, Charlie didn't stop partying, and Lindsay was arrested again, and the three kids he had went missing. Many months later Ja'Marcus (Snoop Dogg) and D'Andre (Mac Miller) are walking in the woods looking for cannabis plants, but what they find is a cabin in the woods, and inside they find the three missing children and turn them in for the reward, they are kept in a child development research until they are deemed well enough to leave. They put in the custody of Charlie's brother Dan Sanders (Simon Rex) and his wife Jody (Ashley Tisdale), but they can only keep them if they agree to stay in a house with cameras filming their every movement, Jody is first reluctant to have the children, but tries to bond. While doing this she also auditions and gets into a ballet academy, and she tries to win the leading part in Swan Lake as the Swan Queen, but the family are being threatened by the invisible paranormal activity, and the children reveal that it is the spirit they were growing up with, a mother figure ghost-like creature called Mama. The couple's Hispanic maid Maria (Lidia Porto) is frightened by the paranormal forces attacking and tries various religious rituals to stop it, and meanwhile Dan is trying to make progress in his experiments to make apes more intelligent at his research facility, and him being stupid he doesn't realise chimpanzee Caesar (Chris 'Critter' Antonucci). After attempting to use the help of psychic Blaine Fulda (Katt Williams) who turns out to be a complete fraud, and dream extractor Dom Kolb (Ben Cornish) who tries inception but only ends up creating a Fifty Shades of Grey scenario with Christian Grey (Jerry O'Connell), Dan and Jody decide to return to the cabin in the woods the children were found in for answers. They find the Book of the Dead, which may be the cause of the haunting events, as it possesses anyone nearby when the words ""gort klaatu barada nikto"" are read out, turning them into insane zombie like monsters, and Mama finally shows her face threatening the children near a cliff, but she is defeated being pushed off. Jody realises she loves the children more than anything else, and allows now friend Kendra Brooks (Erica Ash) to have the leading part in Swan Lake, which turns out to be a striptease show, and Caesar in the audience warns us watching to enjoy life while we can before the apes take over, there is a quick post credits bit as well where Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan are alive and that the whole film was a dream. Also starring Katrina Bowden as Natalie, Heather Locklear as Barbara Morgan, J.P. Manoux as Pierre, Molly Shannon as Heather Darcy, Kate Walsh as Mal, Mike Tyson and Josh Robert Thompson (More Than Freeman in the adverts) as the Narrator. I knew this going to be terrible, especially as recurring stars Anna Faris and Regina Hall were not returning as Cindy and Brenda, and the fact that stars who have appeared before are playing either mock versions of themselves or different characters is even more stupid. As with the previous three sequels the spoofs are not funny at all, the gross material and repetitive gags, such as head bangs and slip ups, are awful, silly moments like vacuum cleaners having a party and orgy and children acting like wild animals are ridiculous, and overall it just feels like any scripting, acting and general budget on the film has been blown and turn into an atrocious watch, a crap horror spoof. Poor!",Scary Movie V
8,BA_Harrison,A new low for the Scary Movie series.,1,30 July 2018,"Most spoof movies tend to be a bit hit and miss; Scary Movie V is all miss. Its targets are a selection of recent horror movies - Mama, Paranormal Activity, Insidious and The Evil Dead - and, for no discernible reason at all, non-horror hits Inception, Black Swan, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and 50 Shades of Grey.Having already suffered through part 1-4, I was expecting part 5 to be bad (Anna Farris went so far as to get pregnant to avoid appearing in this one), but I never imagined it could be this awful! It's 88 minutes of utterly puerile, laugh-free nonsense that feels like it was written by a bunch of teenage boys (and not very smart ones at that). A jaw-droppingly terrible sex scene starring Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan, Snoop Dogg raiding a marijuana farm, a crap Leonardo DiCaprio lookalike, monkeys throwing poop, a little girl humping someone's leg, a baby on fire, and a wild pool party held by automated pool cleaning machines (yes, you read that correctly!): just a few of the unbelievably dreadful moments in this total wreck of a movie. Rarely has $20million been so poorly spent.1/10, for the lovely Ashley Tisdale, who I'm guessing didn't watch the previous movies before signing on the dotted line, and because 0/10 is still not an option.",Scary Movie V
9,paul_haakonsen,Another spoof launched...,5,10 June 2013,"I found ""Scary MoVie"" to be a refreshing revisit to the series, especially after parts 3 and 4. However, if you are just the slightest familiar with the ""Scary Movie"" movies, then you know what you are in for here in this fifth installment - more goofs, spoofs and cheap laughs.The storyline is basically the same as the previous movies, a vague red line throughout the course of the movie, on which a series of spoof elements of other movies are built up. Does it work? Sure, as there is coherency in the storyline.""Scary MoVie"" does manage to pull off the spoofs in the great way that the the movie series is known for and doing well, compared to other spoof movies available on the market.However, the movie never really manages to rise itself above mediocrity, rolling on jokes and situations that you see coming a mile away. Is the movie funny? Yeah, to a certain extend. Does it entertain? Yeah, to a certain extend. Is it a movie that is a must to watch? Hardly so.The people cast for the various roles were doing great jobs with their given silly roles, as always and as in the previous movies. So they are keeping the style going from the previous movies. Also the effects in the movie were quite good and did really work out quite well in favor of the movie. And the movies spoofed in ""Scary MoVie"" were nicely made fun in great ways and isn't a good spoof always good for a couple of laughs?",Scary Movie V
10,Coventry,"Stupidity and redundancy, part V",4,11 February 2015,"Either I was still high on the antibiotics I was taking for that viral infection I suffered from or either I've grown entirely numb for awful horror spoofs over the years, but fact remains that I was a lot less irritated by this fifth installment in the ""Scary Movie"" franchise than by any of the previous ones. Could it be that this latest and still equally redundant sequel is slightly better than the previous ones? Don't get me wrong, it's still a very lackluster effort – hence my four out of ten rating – and it's maximally on par with the mediocre original of the series, but at least I chuckled a couple of times and I even caught myself thinking that a handful of the gags and situations were moderately ingenious! Maybe it's because the annoying lead actress Ana Faris got replaced by the less annoying Brittany Murphy lookalike Ashley Tisdale or perhaps the parody veterans David Zucker and Pat Proft (""Airplane"", ""Hot Shots!"") found their occasional old shape back? Who knows, maybe it's even linked to the fact there was a decent period gap of seven years since the last film this time, whereas the previous films followed each other with an interval of one or two years. Part five primarily focuses itself on spoofing the okay but vastly overrated ""Mama"". Next to that, it also makes fun of a series of other recent attempts at horror/thriller, including ""The Evil Dead"" (remake), ""Black Swan"", ""Paranormal Activity"" and the latest sequels to ""Planet of the Apes"". For me personally, it probably helped that I disliked every single one of these flicks. Simon Rex' stupid facial expressions are sometimes fun and particularly the parody of ""The Cabin in the Woods"" and ""The Evil Dead"" made me smile. Still 90% of the script is downright embarrassing and even too retarded for words, most notably all sequences with the Latina housemaid and the intelligent monkey. My advice would be not to spend any money on this, but watch it when it comes on television and don't be afraid to fall asleep, since you won't miss out on anything.",Scary Movie V
11,sunwarrior13,Time To End The Franchise,6,17 April 2013,"Scary Movie 5,also known as styled as Scary MoVie, is a film and the fifth film in the Scary Movie franchise. The film parodies Paranormal Activity, Mama, The Cabin in the Woods, Evil Dead, Inception, Sinister, Black Swan, Rise of the Planet of the Apes', Insidious, Fifty Shades of Grey, and Tyler Perry's character Madea.It has an ensemble cast that includes Ashley Tisdale,Simon Rex,Erica Ash,Molly Shannon,Heather Locklear,J.P. Manoux,Jerry O'Connell,Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan. It is directed by Malcolm D. Lee and written by David Zucker.The movie must be some kind of psychological experiment. Perhaps the filmmakers sat in a lab, rubbing their temples while wondering aloud how awful they could make a movie and still score at the box office.Too bad that this vapid, vulgar insult to the intelligence couldn't possibly have been tested on any focus groups.Obviously,it has reached the cinematic saturation point with the rapidly-expiring franchise.This fifth installment suggests that it is time to end it.",Scary Movie V

13,zardoz-13,Not the Funniest Spoof But Pretty Fun,8,12 April 2013,"Friends and colleagues constantly remind me the pun ranks as the lowest form of humor. Let the word go forth: I love puns! I acquired my taste for puns from repeat viewings of both classic Marx Brothers' comedies as well as the vintage James Bond thrillers. The only thing I treasure more than puns are cinematic parodies. ""Scary Movie 5"" doesn't qualify as the funniest entry in the franchise. Nevertheless, I had a blast watching this shallow scatological spoof and laughing at the way it skewered a number of recently successful films. ""Undercover Brother"" director Malcolm Lee and ""Scary Movie 3"" scenarists David Zucker and Pat Proft furnish audiences with a farcical frenzy of sight gags and slapstick designed to make us cringe with delight. The biggest difference between ""Scary Movie 5"" and the four previous entries is the conspicuous absence of Anna Farris. Ashley Tisdale replaced Farris in this installment because Farris was pregnant when the producers lensed it in September and October of 2012. Although she lacks the deer-caught-in-the-headlights idiocy that Farris brought to each of the previous outings, Tisdale acquits herself adequately enough under the circumstances. Similarly, Regina Hall skipped this one, but she wasn't pregnant like Anna. Meantime, Dimension Films hasn't regaled us with a ""Scary Movie"" since the fourth installment came out back in 2006. Any time a sequel to a sequel doesn't appear a year or two after its predecessor, you have to figure something must have gotten in the way. Hundreds of movies have come and gone in those intervening seven years, and the ""Scary Movie"" people have ignored some that would have been ripe for ridiculing. My chief complaint is that neither Lee nor his scripters have lacerated ""The Hunger Games,"" ""Looper,"" the ""Twilight"" sagas, ""The Expendables,"" ""Pitch Perfect,"" ""The Social Network,"" ""The King's Speech,"" and ""Avatar."" The best scene in ""Scary Movie 5"" is the opening scene with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan in bed together deriding their reputations in a riff on the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies. An earlier ""Scary Movie"" skewered Michael Jackson, but a lookalike stand-in played Jackson. Here the Real McCoys are mocking themselves and it's a hoot to watch them. Afterward, we are treated to a series of titles like those in the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies about the disappearance of the participants. Although Charlie's body was found, we are informed that his corpse continued to party hardy. The scene then shifts to the woods of Humboldt County where Snoop Dog and Mac Miller are searching for weed rather than Charlie's three missing children. They stumble onto a cabin in the woods where they encounter Charlie's kids scuttling around at thrice the speed of normal, ordinary humans. Initially, neither is sure what is haunting the cabin and they deploy an arsenal of firearms with which they riddle the premises. Eventually, they learn they're blasting away at two, filthy, unwashed urchins. They turn the kids over to the authorities and score a handsome reward. Charlie's brother Dan (Simon Rex of ""Superhero Movie"") and Dan's wife Jody (Ashley Tisdale of ""Donnie Darko"") are awarded custody of Charlie's children. The Institute for Case Studies allows them to raise the siblings on the condition that Dan and Jody live in a palatial residence house. As part of the deal, Dan and Jody get a hirsute Hispanic housekeeper, Maria (Lidia Porto of ""Idiocracy""), who bears her Catholicism like a cross. They also get a German shepherd police dog. The superstitious Maria starts blessing the baby the moment after Jody crosses the threshold with him. Throughout these scenes, a grey-skinned hag in black apparel flits around in the background. The responsibility of raising his brother's children prompts Dan to push himself harder at his job so he can impress his bosses. Dan conducts research at a primate laboratory. He has been carrying out an experiment on apes to ascertain their intelligence. Naturally, all the apes turn into anti-social specimens, while one of them, Caesar, exhibits above-average intelligence.Meanwhile, Jody aspires to be a ballerina like her mother who gave birth to her during a performance of Swan Lake. At the same time, Jody's friend Kendra Brooks (Erica Ash of ""MADtv"") is competing for the role, while long time prima ballerina Heather Daltry (Molly Shannon of ""Superstar"") launches a smear campaign against Jody. Poor Dan runs into trouble galore at his laboratory. Jody persuades the children to tell her about their mom who raised them in the wild until demons came along to possess her. She found a mysterious tome that warned her not to recite its evil incantations. At home, the demons possess the swimming pool droids and these nifty mechanical devices treat themselves to a pool party, snorting cleaning powder.This time around ""Scary Movie 5"" roasts not only the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise, but also ""Inception,"" ""Black Swan,"" ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" ""Sinister,"" Mama,"" ""A Cabin in the Woods,"" and ""Evil Dead."" Mind you, I loved the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise, and I laughed at the hilarious send-up that Lee and his scribes gave it, especially with the swimming pool droids. The scenes that mocked ""Evil Dead"" are pretty funny, too. Of course, you'll have to endure the usual lowest common denominator bowel humor as well as assorted penis jokes. The metaphorical montage of pseudo lesbian love scenes resembles the heterosexual hot-dog scenes from ""The Naked Gun"" parodies. Not surprisingly, Zucker and Proft were the geniuses behind that franchise, too. Two last minute surprises will have you rolling. First, you'll realize why Snoop Dog wanted a yacht with a shark in its pool. Second, you'll discover that the narrator is more than just a guy who mimics Morgan Freeman. Clocking in at a trim 85 minutes, ""Scary Movie 5"" doesn't squander a second. You should stick around for the amusing end credits and the outtakes that appear throughout them.",Scary Movie V
14,view_and_review,As Far as Parodies Go This Wasn't That Bad,5,10 June 2015,"I had lost count of the Scary Movies. I actually thought I'd already seen this one. They're all one big blur with the exception of the first Scary Movie; that was undeniably the best and it went downhill after that. I believe there was a sharp drop after Marlon and Shawn Wayans left the franchise.At any rate, it was on Netflix so I figured there was no loss if I watched it to see if in fact it was one I'd seen already. Well, it wasn't and I did enjoy it. The main spoof was the movie Mama which I have seen so I was able to understand many of the references. Parodies are typically bad so this one was probably above average for a parody. It wasn't too vulgar, the slapstick and physical comedy wasn't too over the top, I got to see both Sheen and Lohan ridicule themselves. Not too bad.",Scary Movie V
15,neil-476,So-so spoofery,6,19 April 2013,"The fifth entry in the Scary Movie franchise drops any attempt at continuity, and remains content to simply spoof some of the more recent horror (and other) movies - specifically, Paranormal Activity, the Evil Dead remake, Mama, Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, Inception, Black Swan, the 50 Shades Of Grey books. There is no plot to synopsise - the thing is made up of sequences lifted from each film nailed together with no real regard for making any sense. Just the same as the previous five, in fact.After an opening sequence in which Charlie Sheen and Lindsey Lohan happily lampoon their reputations, Ashley Tisdale takes on the female protagonist role, and is the only recognisable name, as the spoofery unfolds. Miss Tisdale does quite well here (and features in some very entertaining corpsing in end-titles outtakes).Like all these movies, the success of the spoofs depends on whether you have seen the source material, what sort of mood you are in and so on - my feeling is that this particular entry wasn't as good as the early Scary Movies, but was substantially better than the regrettable Date Movie, for instance.",Scary Movie V
16,anaconda-40658,Wish It Was All Sheen and Lohan.,5,3 June 2015,"Scary Movie 5 (2013): Dir: Malcolm D. Lee / Cast: Ashley Tisdale, Simon Rex, Lidia Porto, Erica Ash, Molly Shannon: About on par with the previous two sequels. That is to say that it is nowhere near as good as Scary Movie but certainly better than the relentlessly bad Scary Movie 2. This one stars Ashley Tisdale and Simon Rex as a couple put in charge of three children. These children behave like animals in a reference to Mama. Tisdale desires a return to ballet in a Black Swan reference. Rex works at a lab that examines the intelligence of apes in a reference to Rise of the Planet of the Apes. As with previous sequels there is nice touches to the story including a great opening involving Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan in a jab at Paranormal Activity. Other films referenced here are Insidious, Inception, and the repeatedly verbally referenced Cabin in the Woods. Tisdale and Rex pull through with all sorts of strange night terrors happening. Tisdale even dons the hideous black wig that Jessica Chastain wore in Mama thus indicating how idiotic she appeared. Rex is involved in several home improvement accidents before he enlists the help of one of the apes to watch the children. The stealing performance is Lidia Porto as Maria the nanny with religious rituals that go into overload. Molly Shannon pulls a mean Winona Ryder in her take on Black Swan and being ticked off. Other roles span from amusing to merely reciting better films. Director Malcolm D. Lee presents the visual jokes but a misfire film. At any rate it proves I am right in claiming that Mama is one of the worst films of the year. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Scary Movie V
17,FlashCallahan,An unfunny ordeal.....,2,19 January 2014,"After adopting three children that are found in the woods, Jody, a ballet dancer, and Dan, an ape researcher, begin to experience strange events in their new home. With the help of some bizarre characters, Jody and Dan must find out what is causing these supernatural happenings....The first thing you notice after watching this movie, is how old the script must have been, and how desperate they want to keep the film up to date. It primarily spoofs Black swan, and Rise of the Planet of the apes, but then swaps to Mama, Evil dead, and even the fifty shades books.But all in all, its unfunny stuff, a real ordeal to get through, and little to no redeeming qualities about the whole thing.On the plus side, Tisdale is easy on the eye, and that's the positives out of the way.The editing is bad, the script all over the shop, and the narrative non existent.It's easily one of the worst films of 2013, making an already stale franchise even poorer.Really don't bother.",Scary Movie V
18,trashgang,not good but better then a lot of spoofs made these days,6,8 January 2014,"Having a big laugh with the first Scary Movie (2000) the second entry was already a downfall and it got worse with every release. Enter number 5 into the franchise but this time my twelve year old daughter wanted to see it too because Ashley Tisdale (Jody) was in it who she knew from High School Musical (2006). And I must say that she did have a few scene's laughing out loud, especially with the baby but after 30 minutes she went back to her multimedia. Do I need to say more?I watched it until the end and stated as 85 minutes it stops around 72 minutes, from there on it's the end credits but they warned the viewer, bloopers on the way. So I waited, and watched the bloopers who some looked like they were set in scene. Overall, I did had a smile here and there but still it's a turkey.It's always so weird to see big names from back in the days coming into the franchise. There only for a few minutes in it so don't pick it up for that reason. This time the story is based on the horror Mama (2013) and the Paranormal Activity franchise. It do works here and there but some parts are really childish or on the edge of slapstick. For me the best part was the spoof on Evil Dead (2013),the split tongue and the removal of the arm, it's all there, and the lesbian scene of Black Swan (2010). The producers clearly made it for teens because there's no nudity in it. Two girls do have a shower scene but are dressed in their bikinis. It's not good at all but I have to say better then the Twilight spoofs out there or zombie spoofs. Gore 0,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 1/5",Scary Movie V
19,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Scary MoVie,1,2 May 2013,"I thought after some days of hectic work I'd pick the funniest film on release this week to laugh my rear off, but unfortunately Scary Movie 5 turns in a disappointing form, with the Wayan brothers abandoning their franchise for A Haunted House instead. Despite having David Zucker in a writing capacity, this installment seems finally to have run out of steam in its long-running franchise, one which took the horror films in between them and give them the spoof treatment. And the lack of material shows despite the seven year absence, having to touch non-horror films as well given the wafer thin content upon which to draw inspiration from and to make fun of.And you would think that their crowning glory, having the two Tinseltown folks who can't seem to get out of trouble and the wrong side of the limelight - Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan - would be a tad interesting, but it's not. Both look like they were in it for the paycheck, and couldn't care less to ham it up a little. The jokes they partook in were really bad, with absolutely nothing to laugh at or about, and if they were to think they have a second career as comedians, they just might want to think again, given their lack of comic timing.No spoof of any horror film today would be without the Paranormal Activity style of video cameras being mounted almost everywhere, with the playback naturally being remotely hilarious, especially when people tend to miss the whole point of what they were hoping to see. Forming the basis for whatever semblance of a storyline is that of Mama, which involves Jody (Ashley Tisdale) and Dan (Simon Rex) picking up three spooky kids, thrown into a mix of Paranormal Activity, complete with a haunted house, Mama, and a housekeeper whose antics were probably the best bits in the film.Then came some other story development that linked up Black Swan, RIse of the Planet of the Apes and Evil Dead, for the most parts, and so you have one really amalgamated piece of narrative that had tried its best to blend these diverse stories together, but as it turned out, someone forgot to include genuine comedy in the film, short of tapping into the same old bags of toilet humour just for laughs. Some worked, and most didn't. Perhaps it is time to retire the franchise, for good. Even A Haunted House, was miles better than this, without having its jokes run stale, or feeling forced.The many cameo appearances, do nothing to save the film from its depths of woeful scenes trying their hardest to pass off as comedy. And as if sitting through the film isn't torture enough, you can elect to stay until after the end credits to extend that dreaded feeling for a scene longer.",Scary Movie V
20,StevePulaski,A parody film for the generation who can't sit still,1,8 July 2013,"If there was ever a franchise to run out of steam before it even began and was already too long and overdone simply by having one film in its series, it's a franchise belonging to the modern parody genre. I've mentioned before that this is probably the worst genre in cinematic history, and few other genres have experienced such a rapid decline in quality since their birth. The parody genre is still relatively new in terms of feature-length films, with works such as Airplane! and The Kentucky Fried Movie only dating back to the late seventies.Why did those films work so well and why does Scary Movie V fail so miserably? Because their prime goal wasn't to parody as many films as possible, but rather try and make fun of genre-conventions and certain obligatory things audiences have become accustomed to for so long. When watching a film like Airplane!, it almost makes you a more aware moviegoer because you're seeing how often these clichés are used and how laughable they actually are when put to a sillier context.Scary Movie V has nothing - simply nothing - to work with, and for sixty-eight minutes does it lumber lifelessly to the next ridiculous and boring film parody before abandoning it almost entirely. There's so much going on, while simultaneously so little, that the film gets its story lost. It keeps changing tones, parody elements, themes, characters, and events to the point that this is nothing more than an overlong collage of cheaply redone scenes from other films of recent years.The four main films the picture is predicated off of are Mama, Paranormal Activity, Black Swan, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Right off the bat, boy are we a dated party-guest trying desperately to be in-the-loop. Bloody Disgusting's website tells me Scary Movie V began shooting in September 2012, but the film managed to incorporate parodies of Mama and Evil Dead, which didn't hit theaters until the first and second quarters of 2013. This is obviously a move to try and remain current by the time the film comes out. However, because these movies weren't out at the time, the material used to parody them is thin and taken from the trailers, which isn't very convincing or fun. And even so, in three years, who will laugh at these references? More films along the lines of the aforementioned horror films will inevitably be released. Films like Airplane! never get old because their genre-clichés won't allow to them.For the first time in the franchise's history, Anna Faris and Regina Hall do not appear at all, and the dubious honor of being lead characters in a redundant parody film are handed to Ashley Tisdale and Erica Ash. Other stars such as Lindsay Lohan, Charlie Sheen, Snoop Dogg, Mike Tyson, Jerry O'Connell, and Katt Williams star as predominately cameos in a film where itself is one big cameo in the field of cinema. Nobody looks to be trying here, and frankly, they don't need to. Pat Proft and David Zucker's screenplay leaves almost no imagination and in just over an hour's worth of time manages to make every joke go on for way too long and make one of the tedious comedy ventures so far this year.While I haven't formally reviewed the previous films in the series, I have seen them all in either the theater or on DVD. The first was a nifty little feature, following in the footsteps of Scream to a reasonably charming effect. The second film is one of the few cases where the sequel is actually more impressive and funnier than the original film (the same thing happened with Scream 2, in my opinion). The third and forth were instantly forgettable endeavors capitalizing off of the goal to make these films more of a competition of references than actual films with plot that feature jabs at conventions and modern films. The series fell off when Shawn and Marlon Wayans were booted, resulting in David Zucker taking over from there. This is when the films became safe, woefully unremarkable, stale, and disposable.The word for Scary Movie V is ""lifeless,"" as everything from writing, acting, and even directing by Malcolm D. Lee seems to be nothing more than a pitiful cash-in on material gone dry. When a film dedicated to lampooning other films is trying this hard to make the audiences laugh, it doesn't seem to be any better, more sophisticated, or on any other level than the films being mocked.Starring: Ashley Tisdale, Erica Ash, Simon Rex, Molly Shannon, Heather Locklear, J.P. Manoux, Jerry O'Connell, Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Lohan, Mike Tyson, Snoop Dogg, and Katt Williams. Directed by: Malcolm D. Lee.",Scary Movie V
21,OllieSuave-007,"It's actually the second best, I thought.",7,26 September 2015,"Despite the mostly negative reviews, I think this movie is actually the second best of the Scary Movie films. It's one hilarious scene after the other, from Jody (Ashley Tisdale) and Dan Sanders (Simon Rex) dealing with their weird nieces in their paranormal-activity infested home to Jody's ballet dancing misadventures and Dan's ape experiment chaos. The movies Paranormal Activity and Inception are two of the main spoofs in the film and they are hilariously done, and the prologue with Charlie Sheen and Lindsey Lohan was just good, funny starter to the film, especially when Lohan spoofs her own real-life legal woes.Seeing every actor's facial expressions, especially Simon Rex's when he experiences ghost stuff, are just fun to watch. The acting, I thought, was pretty good and the plot was well-paced. There are plenty of slapstick humor and so-stupid-it's-funny comedy, but I think the sexual innuendos are a little overboard - especially the spoof to The Black Swan. But overall, it's not a bad film - good for some laughs and popcorn time.Grade B-",Scary Movie V
22,Hellmant,Not as bad as the Wayans brothers' two installments.,4,30 October 2013,"'SCARY MOVIE 5': Two Stars (Out of Five)The fifth installment in the never ending 'SCARY MOVIE' franchise, which began in 2000 with the Wayans brothers at the helm (the eldest, Keenen, directed the original film and his brothers Shawn and Marlon co-wrote and co-starred in it). It was a huge financial hit but was also loathed by most critics and movie fans. The second film was helmed by the same trio of Wayans, performing the same duties, but was much less successful at the box office and even more despised by critics and cinephiles. David Zucker (who co-directed and co-wrote such classic spoof comedy films as 'AIRPLANE!', 'THE NAKED GUN: FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD!', 'TOP SECRET!' and 'BASEKETBALL') took over directing duties (from Keenen Ivory Wayans) on the third film and Craig Mazin (who also co-wrote the 'HANGOVER' sequels) and Pat Proft (who co-wrote such classic comedies as 'POLICE ACADEMY', 'HOT SHOTS!', 'BACHELOR PARTY' and 'REAL GENIUS') took over writing duties. It was a huge hit and a noticeable improvement over the previous installments. Jim Abrahams (who also co-wrote 'AIRPLANE!', 'TOP SECRET!' and 'HOT SHOTS', as well as another classic 'THE KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE') also joined the writing team on 'SCARY MOVIE 4'. It wasn't quite as good or successful as '3' but it was still a better film than the first two movies. Now we get 'SCARY MOVIE 5', which was written by Zucker and Proft but directed by Malcolm D. Lee (who's directed such hit comedy films as 'UNDERCOVER BROTHER', 'SOUL MEN' and 'THE BEST MAN'). It's not as bad as the Wayans brothers' two installments but it is a lot worse than the last two movies.Like all the other films in the series it spoofs mostly current hit horror films but it also parodies popular movies in general, as well as pop culture (like the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' novel). This one mainly spoofs the films 'MAMA', 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY', 'BLACK SWAN', 'RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES', 'INCEPTION' and 'EVIL DEAD' (even though the last film was released just a week prior to this movie). The film revolves around Charlie Sheen and his three children going missing. Sheen's kids are then found in the woods, living like wild animals and having been raised by a spirit called 'Mama'. Sheen's brother and brother's girlfriend take the kids in. The movie stars Simon Rex as Sheen's brother (who also appeared in 'SCARY MOVIE 3' and '4', as another character) and Ashley Tisdale as his girlfriend. It features cameos from other stars like Lindsay Lohan, Darrel Hammond, Molly Shannon, Snoop Dog, Heather Locklear and Jerry O'Connell. It's the first film in the series to not feature Anna Faris or Regina Hall. The film is bad, there's hardly a funny joke in the entire movie, but I still found it amusing. Mostly just because I like movies so much (and especially the horror genre) that I just enjoyed all the film references. I agree with all the critics that it's poorly written and just plain stupid but it at least isn't full of over-the-top gross-out humor like the first two movies and it isn't quite as stupid either (in my opinion). The Wayans' films were painfully bad and unfunny (for me). I couldn't stand watching them. This installment was at least amusing (for me) and I liked watching all the stars in it. It's not as good as 'SCARY MOVIE 3' or '4' but some film nuts might get a slight kick out of it (like I did).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDL6l-UAwQ",Scary Movie V
23,cherold,I like all of them,7,2 September 2013,"I like the Scary Movies; all of them. Yes, this one and the preceding it are probably the weakest of the series, but I still laughed a lot. It's just silly, unapologetically stupid comedy.It's also a series I just have to watch regardless of what people say, because for the entire series, people are been declaring it horrible and not worth watching. Even the first one, which is always held up as the best of the series, was viciously slammed when it came out.As with all the movies in the series, it's very hit and miss. Sometimes it's laugh out loud funny, sometimes it's just unpleasant.My biggest objection to this one is some of the racial stereotyping. It's not just that racial stereotyping is not a good thing, but that at this point it's been so played out that it's not remotely funny. Still, overall, I laughed a lot.",Scary Movie V
24,Robert_duder,Mind blowingly awful...which is exactly what I expected,2,2 May 2013,"I suppose I am the wrong person to write this review. I hate spoof movies, I don't even particularly like comedies unless they are very specific ones or classics. I knew I'd hate Scary Movie 5. That being said I didn't hate it as much as some of the previous ones maybe because I went in knowing just how bad it was going to be. It still stuns me that ANY person with even a remote sized brain could actually enjoy crap like this. It doesn't even make sense, its not even a movie, it has no story and just one stupid slapstick moment after another. I think people have forgotten how to actually make people laugh. I mean this might be watchable as a 30 second Youtube video made by 12 year olds but as a feature length movie released to theatres...it literally makes me nauseous. This is crap that goes far beyond a bad movie. It isn't even entertaining. It just goes on and on and completely regurgitates the same tired gags that you see again and again and again in every spoof movie done in the last ten years. My only reason for not putting a fat zero on this is that the cast is decent...none of it is their fault. The movie is awful because of the script and disgusting film making.Ashley Tisdale holds her own and tries her darndest to make sense out of utter crap. Her stupid facial expressions and having to deal with the dumbest situations ruins any chance of being even remotely funny. Simon Rex is synonymous with crappy comedies. That being said his physical comedy (something I respect a great deal) is well done even in the worst of circumstances. Erica Ash should basically be ashamed of her performance in this film. Not only just because she is terrible but because her stereotypical ""black girl"" performance is awful and sickening. The myriad of cameos are fun but nobody really stands out. Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan are marginally entertaining but their jokes are so incredibly stale. Katt Williams, Terry Crews, Lidio Porto, Darrell Hammond and Snoop Dogg are a few of the more main cameos in the film and all are average to terrible.I was actually surprised that director Malcolm D. Lee wasn't a total nobody pulled out of obscurity. He actually has some well known mainstream comedies under his belt and while nothing stands out as sheer brilliance, he has certainly done better than this. But really how much better can you do garbage? The script is awful, there is no story and the spoofs are so blatant and tired that anyone who even remotely finds something amusing about this needs their head examined. This isn't entertainment, this is disgusting, boring crap. I would never sit through it again and only did this time because my wife thought she would enjoy it...she didn't and neither did I. Skip this and find something more entertaining, like watching grass grow. 2/10",Scary Movie V
25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Unbelievably sh!t,1,30 August 2013,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningI'm used to seeing spoofs where I know the films that are being parodied, but the recent crop of franchised, sanitised horror films have failed to catch my attention, so it was no help that I hardly even knew any of the films Scary Movie 5 was sending up. But know them or not, what can't be denied is what started out as an inspired, refreshing, if gross and thoroughly none PC idea got completely carried away with itself and just descended in to painfully unfunny dross. And so this fifth instalment, coming seven years after the last one, has an air of desperation about it, like some lazy studio executives thinking up something cheap and heartless for a quick buck. They've certainly failed to provide something even vaguely resembling a coherent plot, and so Scary Movie 5, lacking the Wayans Brothers touch that got it started, is left to just drag on in to the wilderness.Barely 70 minutes long, it's hard to think how something so short could be so torturous, but as it drags along without the merest hint of a laugh as it does, it becomes even more of a painful slog to the end. I'm just glad I didn't really pay to see it. NO STARS",Scary Movie V
26,bowmanblue,Ask yourself a question...,6,1 December 2014,"...if you saw someone fall over in the street, not really hurting themselves, would you laugh? Probably. However, if you saw someone fall over in the street twenty to thirty times, would you still find it that amusing? Unfortunately, the latest in the Scary Movie franchise does to rely on people simply falling over again and again (and again) to get the majority of its laughs. And this is a shame, because - believe it or not - there are actually some quite amusing moments in the film.The first Scary Movie (if you can remember that far back!) parodied Scream and, as a result, followed the story pretty closely. Therefore, Scary Movie (1) actually HAD a story. By the time we arrive at number five, it's a mish-mash of a dozen different horror films, therefore there's hardly a story to speak of. Yes, most of it tries to copy 'Mama' (and if you haven't seen Mama then most of the remaining gags will probably be lost on you), but expect moments from Evil Dead, Paranormal Activity, Inception, Black Swan and Rise of Planet of the Apes.However, it's not all bad. Ashley Tisdale is surprisingly enjoyable and dippy to watch (a reasonable substitute for the missing Anna Farris) and the opening with Charlie Sheen and Lindsey Lohan mercilessly lampooning themselves is sheer comedy gold (just a pity they're only in the first ten minutes).If you're a fan of the series, you may get some enjoyment out of it. I think it's certainly better than parts 2 and 4 (which I hated). However, you really have to know ALL the horror movies lampooned to get maximum enjoyment out of it (plus be able to overlook the numerous pratfalls which make up too much of the film).",Scary Movie V
27,g-bodyl,I Want Anna Faris Back!,4,1 August 2014,"Scary Movie 5 is a giant letdown which is unfortunate. Of all the spoof movies that came out in the past decade, I only enjoyed the Scary Movie franchise. Scary Movie 3 is by far the greatest, and Scary Movie 4 is not that fare behind. But then there is this....honestly, they should have never made this film. What made the first four film successes are gone. This film has some good moments but on the whole, it's not a good or funny movie.Malcolm D. Lee's film directs this spoof that spoofs films like the Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Black Swan, Mama, and so on. It's basically about this girl who believes her house is haunted by this terrifying poltergeist.Is it even safe to talk about the acting? The acting is pretty lame. Ashley Tisdale has the makings of a good actress, but not here. Simon Rex, what on earth happened from the good ol' days of Scary Movie 3? Everyone here made Lindsay Lohan seem like an Oscar-nominated actress.Overall, Scary Movie 5 is very disappointing because it's just a lame duck. All the Scary Movies are stupid and dumb, but in a fun way. In this film, I did lots of grimacing. There were some good moments here, namely the real-life spoofs of Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen. Here's hoping they make no more of these films. I rate this film 4/10.",Scary Movie V

Even Jack & Jill is better than this movie, and that is saying something. I wouldn't call myself a huge fan of this series. I enjoyed the first movie, found most of the sequels tolerable, but I wasn't exactly clamoring for another sequel. I thought after the fourth one, this series was beginning to run out of steam. This one spoofs Planet of The Apes, Cabin in The Woods, Evil Dead, Mama, Black Swan, Paranormal Activity, Inception, and even Tyler Perry's Madea character (!) After a somewhat amusing opening with Charlie Sheen & Lindsey Lohan bravely poking major fun at themselves, it went completely downhill. I honestly can't recall laughing out loud once during this movie. Even in Scary Movie II, as awful as it was, I laughed a couple of times. Also, it throws in the raunchy humor, such as Penis jokes, sex jokes, lesbianism, and everything you would expect, only nothing is funny about it. It even throws in a Morgan Freeman soundalike to narrate the film. Desperate much? One thing that really made me shake my head was the ""Ipreggers"" joke. The last time this series was remotely relevant, I don't think I phone's or IPad's were as big as they are now. This movie is sorely lacking Anna Farris. She was at least fun. Ashley Tisdale tries really hard, but she doesn't have the charisma to pull it off. It doesn't help that she has nothing to work with. Simon Rex returns. That's all I really have to say about it. Final Thoughts: After a 7 year hiatus from making these films, why make another one? If Farris was unable to return, as well as Kevin Hart, Regina Hall, The Wayan brothers, among others. That should have told them not to go through with this. It is one of the worst comedies I've ever seen in my life.

Since then there have been many mishaps with the franchise, but each film since its original has seem to appear lower than its processor (with some exceptions) due to subjectivity. However Scary Movie 5 appears to be the lowest the film has sunk. We are witnessed to an unfunny and tiresome spoof film where the directors use tiresome and rehashed jokes to fill time. The film does have certain moments but even in those moments the jokes rarely connect. In general the jokes are mainly misses and the film becomes uninteresting towards the final act. Perhaps it is for the best that this was the final nail in the coffin for the Scary Movie franchise.

As a rewatch 01/04/19' Scary Movie 5 remains the worst of the franchise. Having watching the previous films upon the week, and having forgotten much about this film, one remained slightly unaware of how this film was.This film is quite short in runtime, ending at about 73 minutes (excluding end credits) with many more misses in laughs than hits. The main parodies included Paranormal Activity, Black Swan and Planet of the Apes, along with the Cabin in the Woods, Inception and a few other major blockbusters (many non horror films).The Inception scene parody was possibly the highlight, along with some of the Ape scenes. There were several cameo appearances but most of them were quite dull.

But honestly, I didn't think it was as bad as everyone says it is. For me, the worst film in the franchise was the second on the list. Anyway, this film is bad, and that is indisputable. With him, it seemed, definitely in a definitive way, a franchise that had an unusually long life, considering the kind of films presented.The biggest problem with the film is not being funny. The jokes are within the standard of the franchise, but they are lukewarm, they bet a lot on eschatological humor (I don't know what's worse, that or the sexual obsession that abounds in teen comedies) and the fact that we easily predict them takes away from them grace. Some satires (like the one made for the films ""Mama"" and ""Cabin in the Woods"") did not work, although the script also seemed to me within the standard that the franchise has accustomed us to. There was a lack of a more competent and funny cast, in addition to the firm hand of a director capable of demanding more from everyone involved. Zucker, who signs the script, is good at making comedies when he can do anything he wants, and he has already demonstrated it, having been responsible for ""Scary Movie 4"", for me the best film in the franchise. But he is not alone here, neither in the direction nor in the script, and I do not know how well the joint work went.The cast is amateur, to be nice. I don't know where they were recruited, but what gives the film some life is decent acting and Ashley Tisdale and Erica Ash alongside some of the cameos: the opening scene, with Linsay Lohan making humor out of her own personal misfortune, it just doesn't become infamous because she's comfortable with it, and Snoop Dogg doesn't seem to know how it got there.",Scary Movie V
40,leonblackwood,Waste of time! 1/10,1,25 August 2013,"Review: This movie was completely ridiculous. It's totally not funny and the acting is really terrible. They based the movie around Mama with a touch of Evil Dead, Black Swan and the Cabin In The Woods, but they didn't do the movies any justice. The writers really didn't do a good job and most of the actors are either in debt or have suffered a slump in there careers. I'm not a big fan of the Scary Movie franchise, so I got what I expected from this film. Judging by the money that this movie has made, I sure that they will be releasing more movies in this franchise, but I personally think that they should look for some better writers or just leave the series alone. Terrible!Round-Up: The out takes at the end of the movie are much funnier than the actual film itself. There are loads of innuendo's which refer to other movies but they weren't that cleverly done. Tyson had sunk to a all time low by making an idiot of himself in this movie, as well as Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan who have gone through there own personal turmoils of late. If they were using this movie to boost there careers, they have definitely picked the wrong film.Budget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $64millionI recommend this movie to people who are fans of the Scary Movie franchise, but don't expect much. 1/10",Scary Movie V

Holy. Mama. Flipping. Spoof. Balls. What a monstrosity. I can't believe I endured it. I've done it guys! I actually watched the whole thing in one sitting. I've evolved as a film critic, and I didn't press B to cancel. Throw anything at me, I'll watch it. Unstoppable. Uncontrollable. Un-flipping-believable. I am...that guy. A family adopt two feral girls and move into a house that is haunted by a mothering ghost. 'Mama' plus 'Paranormal Activity' divided by 'Cabin in the Woods' multiplied by 'Inception' and halved by 'Fifty Shades of Grey' equals one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's not even bad good...it's just plain bad. It started off well with a self-referential scene including Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan, and then it declined to nothingness. I didn't laugh once, heck I didn't even smile. The jokes were horrendous and seemed like they could only appeal to a three year old. Honestly. There were more jokes orientated towards bums then actually anything witty...in fact, there was no wit. It was aimless. Dumb. When was sticking an object up your ass and smelling it funny? When was spontaneously combusting babies humorous? I just can't even comprehend the thought process of this! The lack Anna Faris and Regina Hall was noticeable and was a huge detriment to this fifth instalment. Ashley Tisdale? Really!? Shouldn't she be singing next to a swimming pool in 'High School Musical 2'? Heck, I don't want her on my screen! Snoop Dogg? Usher!? They really were clutching at straws here, sweet lord! I saw better acting in the porn video I watched this morning, and there was no talking in that! Christ! This genre is done. This film has resulted in the decimation of parodies. It's outdated. It's stupid. It's absurdly unfunny. It's just wrong. Scary Movie V is, without a doubt, atrocious.

They all know that it's a silly movie and they seem to be having a good time. Ashley Tisdale is the biggest surprise for me. Not only is she very dreamy looking but she also gives a fearless and very funny performance. What she does in this movie is no easy task. She does a great job. The rest of the cast is also very good. Once I got into the groove, ""Scary Movie V"" ended up being worth the watch.",Scary Movie V

It seems that the filmmakers are trying to too hard to be funny, and the more they are trying they fail completely failed. But I can see the parts where they where not trying so hard, are probably the parts that i was laughing.Ashley Tisdale who I don't doubt is a very talented actress, but is incredibly bland here, nothing she does just does not jump out at you. Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan are pretty good spoofing themselves, but lets face they are already become parodies of themselves at this point. Simon Rex is alright, but really he is just there also. Not as bad has Movie 43, but still not as funny has it tried to be, but still good for a few chuckles.",Scary Movie V

The main spoof this movie focus on is Mama and Black swan and paranormal activity, planet of the apes and there are other spoof as inception and Evil Dead spoof. i Thought Evil Dead spoof was really funny, I laughed Few times in those scenes as for rest of the movie, I did found some scenes funny and other were Jokes goes a little to long and fall flat a number of times. I didn't really like how the movie ended, I didn't find ending that funny at all, Also those fast forward can bit really annoying at time, I there were not that funny at all. I enjoyed it and I laugh a number of times but I did miss Anna, it dose feel a little strange her not being the movie, They were trying to go for a re-boot of series but kinda shot them self in foot with that.

It's not that they're dumb and gross that makes them bad; it's just the laziness in a lot of them.But here we get another winner. If you enjoyed part 3 and part 4 you're in for another treat. We get a more or less completely new cast of characters but I think it's about time to let Cindy and the gang just chill.It's so cool to see adult Ashley Tisdale as the woman-child suddenly under parental responsibilities. It's actually more engaging that her counterpart in ""Mama"".They pack in a lot of contemporary movie references, fascinatingly woven together, fun gags, some naughty stuff, cute little girls and a few pretty pertinent comments on the aesthetic choices of movies.Why are people tearing into it? It's basically got all the things that made part 3 and 4 brilliant. How is this one different except in the ways it needs to be to be a different good movie? I'm baffled.

49,kluseba,Love or hate this nostalgic junk food cinema,7,14 May 2013,"In case you didn't know, Hollywood is becoming less and less original. The number of sequels or remakes even seems to be at new heights this year: ""Carrie"", ""Die Hard V"", ""Evil Dead"", ""Fast & Furious 6"", ""Iron Man 3"", ""Man Of Steel: Superman 6"", ""Star Trek 12: Into Darkness"", ""Very Bad Trip 3"" and so on. The strange thing is that people seem to want to see the lukewarm old stuff again and again and massively run into the theatres. Guess why I've switched to European and Asian cinema over the years. But from time to time, you go back to the movie theatres on a nostalgic note to watch some of those sequels. I've enjoyed the Scary Movie instalments when I was younger and when a few friends asked me to watch the new output I spontaneously joined them and gave this film a try.I must admit that this fifth part of the series had a couple of good laughs for those who know horror movies quite well. I laughed about the absurd sex scenes in the ""Paranormal Activities"" beginning, the stoned dialogues between Snoop Lion and Mac Miller on their way to ""The Cabin in The Woods"", the strange rituals executed by housemaid ""Madea"" Maria, the appearance of the intelligent ape Caesar as in ""Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes"", the ""Inception"" influenced dream sequence about ""Fifty Shades Of Grey"" or the religious teenagers in the cabin in the woods reminding of ""Evil Dead"" were quite funny. On the other side, other passages were rather dull and had their lengths as the ""Black Swan"" and ""Mama"" scenes.I must admit that I got out of the movie theatres with a big smile on my face and I had really enjoyed this entertaining and short flick while it lasted. It's not the best ""Scary Movie"" but also far from being the worst part of the series. That being said it was better than I had expected it to be. What really struck me though is the fact I have some problems to call back in mind all the details of this movie. This is due to three reasons. The story line of the movie is even more stupid than usual and had an almost total absence of sense. The acting is even less impressive and more stereotypical than before. I'm aware of the fact that this kind of movie won't win any Academy Awards but this time the flick was only centred around quick jokes and a few cameo appearances. This movie is another meal of Hollywood junk flick food. It's entertaining but after all quite predictable and superficial of course. It's easy to digest but it's quickly gone as well.In the end, the film can be resumed like this: it's entertaining and quite funny when you watch it but you will soon forget it as well as there is honestly said nothing memorable or outstanding about it. Fans of the first four instalments should watch this fun ride as well. Those who didn't appreciate the first parts won't like this movie either and probably hate the fact that these instalments have been brought back to life again.",Scary Movie V
50,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Scary Movie 5,4,15 May 2014,"As I entered the theater to view Scary Movie 5, I had a feeling that it would be a lousy movie. I mean, I knew what I was getting into. Truth is, I probably shouldn't have gone. My ten dollars along with the $10 contribution of millions of other moviegoers is the main reason why these films continue to get made. Like I said in my previous review of Scary Movie (2000), these turkeys don't cost a lot to make. This one was probably around $20 million. It ended up making a little more than $60 million worldwide. Which brings me to my next thought, I don't think the people working on them care whether they are bad or not. They know that the misguided audience member will somehow get duped into thinking they're seeing something relevant. But after 80-85 short nutrition free minutes (that's the normal running time), they as an audience, just wasted an amount of life that will never come back. Every second counts you know in the stratosphere that is movie land.Now I liked the first Scary Movie. As I stated in my review of it, I thought it was the first of its kind. Just like Airplane (1980) spoofed airports and flying, this one was an original spoof of horror films. But they really should have stopped after the first one. I remember seeing the last 20 minutes of it and realized that a sequel would not work, should not work, and will not work. Scary Movie 5 makes some big mistakes, humongous I tell you. The first is having it be rated PG-13. That's difficult to pull off because the tone is lazy. Everyone is basically trying to project R rated humor in a PG-13 film. I guess the studios are trying to bring in a younger crowd. This is, in my opinion, is to make money. What a silly way of thinking. The first Scary Movie was a huge box office success. It had the cojones to push the envelope on gross out humor. That's why I recommend it even to this day. Scary Movie 5 is a tired exercise that maybe belts out three and four genuine guffaws, that's it. Then there is the second mistake this film commits which is trying to spoof the Paranormal Activity movies. It would have worked had it been done maybe 4 or 5 years ago when it was a fresh concept in everybody's mind. But just like the Scary Movie franchise, there have been I guess three Paranormal Activity sequels/prequels ever since. And let's face it, those movies have pretty much already spoofed or parodied themselves. Finally, there is the preview of this movie which I saw a couple times before viewing the actual product. Some of the scenes in it were actually kinda funny. Guess what, almost none of them are in the final cut. Are you kidding me, wow what a clever bait and switch.I could go on and on how disposable this film is but I'll refrain. Here's one more tidbit: Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan do a cameo in the first five minutes of Scary Movie 5. It was probably the funniest portion of the movie. I kinda wondered why they weren't the stars and had been asked to carry the weight. But who are we kidding, their movie careers have already been dented enough. I'm starting to wonder if they even wanted to get things back on track. I guess not. Oh a lot of washed up entertainers seem to taint the heck out of this movie. In addition to Sheen and Lohan, we have Snoop Dogg, Heather Locklear, Molly Shannon, Jerry O'Connell, Jasmine Guy (yeah, I couldn't make this up if I tried), and Mike Tyson (he was in the film for 10 seconds, good for him). They must be really desperate to be on screen cause it seems we haven't seen them in a long while.Here's another thing I was wondering though, did the actual Morgan Freeman do the narration for Scary Movie 5 or was someone imitating him. Lord I hope not because if it was actually Freeman, I might have to stop going to movies forever. I might be scarred for life.If you really wanna to check out this abomination, it's your choice. Just stay away from the closing credits. They're outtakes that are much worse than the movie itself. And they feel staged like they were actually scripted. Yeah I payed my ten bucks and sat in the theater. If I had to do it over again, I'd probably just go home and watch dust form. That's quality entertainment compared to this.",Scary Movie V

I usually ADORE this kind of film, specially Scary Movie franchise; all the four installments were GREAT to me. However, ""Scary Movie 5"" is just a BIG deception to me. They had seven years to make a decent film or innovate in the saga, but on the contrary happened; this version doesn't have the hilarious feeling all the others had. It's really such a shame that David Zucker changed so much in his work; ""Scary Movie 5"" has simply NO plot whatsoever. It's just a bunch of random scenes, most full of bad and old jokes we're tired of watching. The only scene I laughed is when the maid did housework while sleeping.

53,bob-rutzel-1,BAD and not in a good way,1,28 August 2013,"Don and Judy Sanders (Simon Rex & Ashley Tisdale) believe their family is being terrorized by a demon and must find a way to have this stop. This the basic plot. The rest are just skits that revolve around humans and demons to basically spoof other scary movies. None are funny or even come close to being funny.Being the brave soul I took out Scary Movie 5 (ah, but you knew it was a comedy and not scary) and found it quite unfunny and mostly annoying. . Some have said that this movie spoofs a lot of other scary movies. I wouldn't know, but if you have seen those movies, it will be up to you to decide what skits herein this movie spoofs. I could care less. But, I did learn that this was not a funny movie. It's true that the promos led me to believe I might enjoy this one. Wrong again. And, I was sure that the Mandatory Hollywood Rule for Silly and Stupid things would play a large part. And, without fail, they did, big time throughout the entire movie. This movie is all raunchy slap-stick and done badly by everyone. There was no one in charge of anything. There are a lot of stars in here for cameo purposes. I found the Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan skit shown in the promo to be good. I laughed when Sheen was pulled out of bed by a demon and his jewels stopped his flight into the door. Ouch, ouch, ouch! Sorry, but that was funny. However, that scene WAS NOT in the movie. Fooled again. They used another unfunny skit to Benny Hill music. Celebs I recognized: Snoop Dog, Heather Locklear, Jerry O'Connell and Mike Tyson and there are others whom I have no knowledge of. Other actors were made up to look like the real stars for example: Leonardo DeCaprio and the movie character: Madea. . What you will see: adults hitting kids, fecal fights, child's hair on fire, things shoved up rectums, a lot of fighting some with fists and pots and pans, pies and fruit made with fecal matter, kids humping legs, a microwave being humped I just cannot go on with this. There are outtakes after the movie and none, again, are remotely funny. You will see some mouthing language that you didn't hear during the actual movie.There is a Narrator throughout and he sounded very much like Morgan Freeman, but it was Josh Robert Thompson instead. To give credit to this movie for spoofing other movies would be wrong because everything was done in ultra raunchy and disgusting ways. Basically, what we have is raunchy slap-stick throughout. (1/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Simulated often. Nudity: No, but they came close. Lesbians: Soaping in the shower and later kissing.

54,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Scary Movie 5""- Unwatchable.",1,13 November 2016,"Look, I'm not going to sit here and try to explain and justify my enjoyment of the first four entries in the long-running ""Scary Movie"" series. It's trash in every capacity, plain and simple. Cynical, trendy trash that only seeks to quickly capitalize on whatever is new or hip with filmgoing crowds through only the most base and lowest-common of denominators. Not a single film in the franchise could be called ""art."" And yet... I get a kick out of them. Particularly the second and third films, which were actually very amusing. They may be trash, but they're fun trash. Enjoyable trash. Entertaining trash. Trash with a charming cast and just enough chuckles to make them worth a go on a slow, rainy day at home. Yeah, you'll feel your IQ dropping during some of the stupider moments of those previous films, but they were never so bad as to be offensive or outright dismissed. Then there's ""Scary Movie 5."" ...whelp, this series was fun while it lasted, I guess.I'll level with you. This is one of those very rare occasions where even trying to force myself to watch a movie in order to be able to write a fair and balanced IMDb review, I just couldn't. I honestly was unable to. I had to start skimming through because the film was making me angry. Furious even. How could a series that was honestly never more than just silly, broad parody fall so hard, so quickly? It's shocking just how aggressively unfunny and tedious a film this is. Even by the midway point of the opening scene- a brutally prolonged ""Paranormal Activity"" parody involving Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan trying to make a sex tape- the humor had been completely sapped and it was running on fumes.And this downward spiral only continued with each passing scene, every awkwardly contrived pop-culture reference and all the nonsensical attempts at lampooning then-recent releases. Essentially a melding of ""Mama"", ""Paranormal Activity"", the rebooted ""Planet of the Apes"" series and ""Black Swan"" with a smattering of plot elements from other major films, the storyline is a fundamental mess, with only the most tenuous of connections to string together the constant barrage of shockingly dead on arrival humor. Yes, you could argue that the fourth film's combination of ""Saw"", ""The Grudge"" and ""War of the Worlds"" was messy and contrived... but at least it tried. This one can't even muster up the energy to do that.Story goes that the production was a bit of a mess, with upwards of half the film being hastily re-written, re-shot and re-edited during last minute pick-ups barely two months before release without the participation of original (and solely credited) director Malcolm D. Lee. And it shows. Badly. Even giving it the biggest cut of slack I can, it feels like a mish-mash of several different visions and just stinks of a perplexing combination of apathy and desperation. I have a feeling you can tell which scenes were re-shot and which were in the original version as the tone and feeling will radically change from scene to scene. Some scenes feel like soulless attempts at patching together jokes whereas others feel like everyone was trying... way too hard. And as a result, it comes off disjointed and honestly just uncomfortable to watch.Even the return of Simon Rex in a starring role after his turn as a supporting character in the previous two films (albeit as a new character here) can't save this trainwreck... and I'm one of the people who actually really enjoyed his work in those films as the lovable goofball. Then again, he's the only returning co-star of any previous films, with series leads Anna Faris and Regina Hall- the two beating hearts of the entire series- having long since jumped ship. So I don't know what I expected. If the franchise film can't even attract the attention of its own lead cast members and instead has to upgrade a smaller supporting cast member to be the new star, it's usually not the best of signs.While it may not be quite as condescending and grating as, say... a ""Seltzerberg""-level parody, there's just no salvaging any laughs here. It's a confused, contrived, unfunny and even uncomfortable experience trying to watch ""Scary Movie 5"", and try as I might... I couldn't do it. It's up there with ""Going Overboard"" and ""Fat Slags: The Movie"" as one of the most inherently unwatchable comedies I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing.I really have no other choice but to give ""Scary Movie 5"" a tragic 1 out of 10. It's a shame.",Scary Movie V

Like the last 3 installments most of the jokes are misses but some of them hit way better than they should. And with that being said I'll say that the latest entry is the best the franchise has been since the second film for better or worse. As the film opens Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen are in a bed ready to get it on as they spoof their various life choices cleverly for the most part. But as they are murdered by a sinister force their three children go missing. Months later they are found in the woods ""Mama"" style by a couple of stoners (Snoop Dogg) and returned to their Uncle (sexy Simon Rex) and his new wife (a perfectly vacuos Ashley Tisdale).

I think I have seen suspense-thrillers with more humor than this. All this does is just spoof scenes from different movies, and I never laughed a single time.This movie was bad on so many levels. Every time a character would crack a joke, I just rolled my eyes. The humor consisted of nothing but fart jokes, poop jokes, toilet jokes, slapstick jokes, and stupid sex jokes that are not even funny on paper. There are sex scenes that are not real sex scenes at all, there are a fight scene that looks like a dumb cardboard cartoon off of Youtube, a man who gets injured like every scene from dumb random activities.

61,jeremycrimsonfox,Saving The Worst For Last,1,26 August 2020,"Scary Movie V (Sometimes called Scary Movie, with the V stylized as the roman numeral for five) is the final installment of the Scary Movie series of horror movie parodies, and was released a good seven years after the fourth film. You'd think with that long a wait, the creators would at least try to improve on the humor so it wouldn't rely too much on gross out toilet and sex humor, but sadly, we are mistaken.Starting with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan trying to do a video (can't say which kind in case IMDb guidelines are against it) in a messed up parody of Paranormal Activity, the story begins with Sheen's children being found by two guys who were fleeing from cannibis growers (played by Snoop Dogg and Mac Miller), they are taken under the care of his brother, Dan Sanders, and his wife, Dina. However, by bringing them to a new home, they also bring home a terrible evil.Basically, the gross humor is back, and it's joined by another kind of humor: child abuse, as some scenes have the children being harmed in what looks like comedic situations (one scene has Aiden, the baby, get his head set on fire, with Dan using a fire extinguisher to put it out, which also launches Kathy, another of the three kids, into something that bumps her head). Also, this film has a lot of disturbing stuff for a film carrying the PG-13 rating, making me wonder how they got away with it. Stay away from this film at all costs.",Scary Movie V

63,fernandoschiavi,"""Scary Movie 5"" is certainly the worst of the series so far and t's time for the franchise to rest, being buried six feet under the ground",3,25 April 2021,"This is the bitter end to a series that brought the parody genre to the fore again in the early 2000s and, unfortunately, what we see is a depressing ending, and that is not a word that should be used to define a proposed film. Making you laugh. Gathering a handful of actors without criteria was definitely a bad idea and a lack of commitment to the loyal audience of the series, who valued the old cast. The embarrassment of seeing jokes being made without any effect, or the rescue of commonplaces already overused in the previous four features, is to discourage anyone who has followed the development of the first films. The frustration, among other reasons, is to see a comedy that once was so authorial become silly, with bad seats, jokes out of timing and an excess of nonsense that often does not fit the scene.After David Zucker passed the baton of direction to Malcolm D. Lee, the Scary Movie franchise reached its fifth volume, rivaling in formula and content with the production of Marlon Wayans, Paranormal Inactivity, even coinciding with the parody objects, using the typical first person footage of Paranormal Activity to start your tape. The first news that shocked fans and made us wrinkle our noses was the news that Cindy (Anna Faris) and Brenda (Regina Hall) would not return. How would they manage to make a film in the series without the two main stars? Perhaps the new part of the franchise could be saved by other characters, such as Mahalik (Anthony Anderson), CJ (Kevin Hart) or the president (Leslie Nielsen), but they also don't appear. In fact, ""Scary Movie5"" does not bring back any character in the franchise, absolutely none. Charlie Sheen and Simon Rex even return, but playing different characters, the first participates in the bad opening scene and the second is one of the protagonists.After a mysterious incident involving a couple, played by Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan, their daughters Kathy (Gracie Whitton) and Lily (Alva Kolker) somehow - equally mysterious, but this time, because of the script - they end up in a cabin in the forest, where they are found by a pair of stereotyped drug addicts experienced by Snoop Dog and Mac Miller. After being rescued, the children are adopted by their father's brother, Dan (Simon Rex), and his wife Jody (Ashley Tisdale). After that, strange things start to happen at the family home.Let's talk more about opening this part. The scene begins with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan as a couple about to have sex and who are haunted by a ghost. The scene is ridiculous and sloppy from start to finish, with poor performances and an even worse script, full of exaggerations and appeals to make the viewer laugh forcibly, which does not work. Soon after, we have another ""opening scene"", in which two friends, played by rappers Snoop Dogg and Mac Miller, come across a hut in the middle of the forest and there are two children. The scene is as ridiculous as the first, with stupid dialogues and even worse performances.This fifth part of the series focuses on the story of ""Mama"", but obviously makes reference to several other films - regardless of the genre - during the narrative, such as ""Paranormal Activity"", ""Evil Dead"", ""The Conjuring"", ""The Last Exorcism"", ""Black Swan"", ""Inception"" and the prelude to ""Planet of the Apes"". Originally, the feature would be a parody of ""Panic 4"", just as Inceptional was a parody of the first feature in the horror franchise. However, Wes Craven's film did not achieve the expected commercial success, forcing the parody producers to change their minds. This highlights the fragility of the proposal, which depends directly on the public's prior knowledge of other works to be minimally understood.References to horror films continue, showing Jody's dramas, with repetitive jokes that compare ballet to pole dance. The freak show involving ghosts and demons continues to haunt the existence of the couple, without any condition to make their viewer laugh, making the level of the first four films worse. The tape tries to mix all the aforementioned films looking for an identity, failing to find a minimally acceptable narrative line, since all the elements that add to Jody's drama are completely dispersed from any cohesion or dramaturgical structure. Few of the moments of humor manage to overcome the simple barrier of comedy, not even amusing the public accustomed to torn humorous.Zucker's departure from directing, for him to only write and produce the film, exhibited a considerable decrease in quality, not even having what worked in the rest of Everyone in Panic. The complete absence of positive predicates makes fans more eager for this cinematographic subgenre to ask themselves if the format has any chance of returning to function as entertainment, because even the undemanding viewer this Scary Movie5 is unable to please.Incidentally, the main gags of the film are totally unnecessary for the story's progress, demonstrating the lack of creativity and resourcefulness of the writers. This incompetence can also be seen in the appealing content of some scenes, where the extreme bad taste gets to be offensive, especially in the scene involving Lily and an ice lollipop. Some moments try to emulate the silly humor style of silent films, even using stop-motion in a desperate attempt to offer something that the public has not yet seen in previous films. This is so out of context that they look like bonus scenes during the film itself. When a parody reaches the point of parodying itself - as in certain scenes that refer to the first feature of the franchise -, it is a sign that it has reached rock bottom.The seven intervening years, which took place between the launch of Scary Movie 4 and the production of Scary Movie 5, served to age the type of humor that had been done so far very badly. The audience is different and has aged together. The poorly thought-out sexual scenes are not so pleasing to an audience that in the early 2000s was excited about the bizarre American Pie, and that Scary Movie explored so well. The jokes with the monkeys, the horrible prologue that makes the parody of Paranormal Activity, the first entire act contained of absurdity etc. Takes this film to the bottom of the well. Places that could be used so well here are thrown in the trash.The prologue's metalanguage, of playing with the figures of Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen, does not bring anything new, in fact, it embarrasses the lack of humor in the initial scene, which does not even try to overcome what had already been done. A big problem in this film is the fact that many jokes need to be explained, reaffirmed, many times, by the character who does it. By the way, if humor needs to be explained it is a sign that there is no genuine connection between what is said and the recipient. Already aware of the lack of creativity in the script, many insights are explained within the narrative itself, as in the scene of the newspaper anchor's wife, who needs to reaffirm that she is betraying him - this after the joke has already been made - so that we realize that the scene has a touch of humor. Kind of like making a joke and explaining right away: ""Hi, I made a joke, you know?"". In fact, narration is used within the film, a resource not previously used, which only highlights the need for this film to seek grace at all costs, even if it explains its own jocularities.With the departure of Anna Faris and Regina Hall, the cast became very weak. Simon Rex has never been one of the strengths of the franchise, but here it is ridiculously bad. The famous non-actors invited to participate, such as Mac Miller, Snoop Dogg and Usher only make things worse and there is more for Ashley Tisdale, the only one with a really good performance in the film. The actress is no Anna Faris, but she manages to perform quite well in the midst of so much mediocrity. Probably ""Scary Movie5"" will not have a continuation, not only because of the bad reception by the public, but also because it got the worst box office. If that happens, we will miss Cindy, Brenda, Mahalik, CJ and the others.As if that were not enough, added to all of this we have a montage out of rhythm and continuity that further impairs the effectiveness of humor, which no longer works by itself. ""Scary Movie5"" is certainly the worst of the series so far and one of the worst films ever made in recent years. The sensation of total loss of time invades the thought of those who watch the tape until the end, making the prospect worse by imagining that there may be other numbers like this. The relief almost comes after 74 minutes when the final credits go up after it wasn't possible to have a laugh. Malcolm D. Lee's film suffers from the worst thing that can happen to a comedy film: lack of comic timing. It's time for the franchise to rest, being buried six feet under the ground.",Scary Movie V
64,aesgaard41,"New Sequel, Same Jokes, Same Mistakes",2,11 September 2013,"I went into this movie locked and loaded. I'm well aware how extremely distasteful these movies tend to be and how much steam and potential is lost within the first five to ten minutes, but I stand by my credo that the last halfway decent movie parody ever seen was ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It."" ""A Haunted House"" came close, but like ""Scary Movie 5,"" what we get isn't a very polished script nor is it anything close to a decent comedy. What it actually is just a string of bad sketches and non-sequential scenes strung together in a lazy haphazard plot. What this movie needs is a decent writer with an understanding of story structure and character development. I'm a writer, and I could have tightened and improved this movie twice over. ""Scary Movie 5"" is basically an imperfect spoof of the movie ""Mama"" with a little ""Paranormal Activity"" added to it and way too much ""Black Swan"" and ""Planet Of The Apes."" The ""Apes"" material should have been exorcised entirely; did we not learn from our mistakes with merging science fiction and horror in ""Scary Movie 3"" and ""Scary Movie 4?"" The ""Black Swan"" material is almost amusing, but it takes up too much time from the main plot with Simon Rex and Ashley Tisdale as a couple trying to raise kids, which by itself has huge potential for slapstick, but is instead dragged down by the weak ghost storyline and further weakened by the incessant references to ""Swan"" and ""Apes."" As usual, Simon is great at the slapstick and physical comedy as he goes through several injuries just short of getting dismembered (which instead happens to other characters in the movie), but Ashley looks uncomfortable with the sophomoric humor and R-rated material; her range in the movie is mostly limited to facial expressions and being gratuitously under-used except where someone needs to be embarrassed. They're joined by a roster of both TV and movie stars, such as Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Lohan, Snoop Dawg, Heather Locklear, Jasmine Guy, James Van Der Beek, JP Manoux, Jerry O'Connell and Morgan Freeman as the narrator. Charlie and Lindsay's opening simulated sex tirade isn't amusing nor is it funny, but it does set the style of humor for the movie. More should have been done with Lindsay's possessed scene, which ends way too fast before breaking into the graphics reminding us this is another sequel to a string of movies that didn't need sequels. Overall, the movie isn't over-stuffed with movie references, like say ""Epic Movie"" or ""Meet The Spartans,"" but it still has too many when it should have confined itself to just being a haunted house comedy. Several so-called jokes are stretched too long (Charlie and Lindsay's fake sex scene to the theme of ""The Benny Hill Show""), are extremely over-used (excessive use of accelerated video), just don't work (Ashley's lesbian encounter) or just go nowhere (the pool cleaners in the neighborhood have a pool party). The best jokes belong to the kids who barely get any screen time. This movie is only going to appeal to bored teenagers with limited intelligence, stoners with too much time on their hands, alcoholics scared of going home and fans of parodies hoping beyond hope that something close to ""Young Frankenstein"" or ""Airplane"" might like lightening hit twice, but at this point, all we're getting is a little shock.",Scary Movie V

66,Christian_Dimartino,The saddest movie since Amour.,3,13 July 2013,"I don't mind a really dumb comedy sometimes. But it actually has to be funny. Airplane, that's a stupidly funny movie, and one of the best of all time. As is The Naked Gun Trilogy and the Hot Shots series. Director David Zucker and his team really know how to do stupid right. But not even he and his co-writer Pat Proft can save Scary Movie V.Scary Movie V is a stupefyingly dumb comedy that parodies actual good movies to boost its self esteem. I'm glad Zucker skipped out on directing this thing, but he still wrote this piece of crap, which makes me sad. In fact, the entire movie makes me sad. It makes me sad because it has all of these talented people who have really hit rock bottom, with nowhere else to go. Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Lohan, Ashley Tisdale, Mac Miller, Snoop Dogg (Oops, Snoop ""Lion""), Simon Rex, possibly Heather Locklear, and Katt Williams show up to this thing, and it's the saddest movie since Amour.What is this about? Good question. I don't really know. The story is so mashed together you feel as if Zucker and Proft were mainly trying to make as many references as humanly possible. They spoof Mama (the main one), Evil Dead, Paranormal Activity, Black Swan, Inception (?), and Rise of the Planet of the Apes (?).That said, I laughed once or twice, mainly at the Black Swan scenes (excluding the one where a ballerina, who I'm pretty sure is Heather Locklear, gives birth right on stage). But what also doesn't help the movie is the timing. Because Paranormal Activity has already been parodied in A Haunted House, and much better might I add.At the end of the day, Scary Movie V is pointless, unfunny, and incredibly stupid. Gee, I wonder why Anna Faris didn't show up? Probably because this movie is even too dumb for her, and she's Anna Faris! Charlie Sheen isn't winning anymore. He's losing, and pretty roughly might I add. The same goes for everyone involved in this movie.D",Scary Movie V
67,Laakbaar,Inane slapstick,4,27 May 2013,"There were a few funny moments in this film. Molly Shannon was great, as always. I also liked the uptight blacks in the opera audience.

Simon Rex's role in this movie was reduced to utter stupidity and inane slapstick. I felt a little sorry for him.It was a very fast-paced, visual movie. Most of the visual gags and jokes fell flat for me, perhaps because I tend to avoid horror movies. (I thought they could have had more fun with ""The Divide"" and ""Cabin in the Woods"".) Am I wrong in thinking that SM1 and SM2 were actually sort of clever and funny? The franchise seems to have devolved into bozo slapstick. I don't blame Lee per se, because Zucker's SM4 was just as bad really.Not recommended, even for die-hard fans. Suitable for 11-year-olds perhaps.

71,richieandsam,Please kill off the Scary Movie franchise now.,5,21 December 2013,"SCARY MOVIE VBlimey again we have a franchise that doesn't know when to end. This movie should have never been made.This movie parodies other horror films that have recently come out. In this film we see spoofs of Evil Dead, Mama, Paranormal Activity, Cabin in the Woods, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Black Swan and Inception.I loved Scary Movie. I thought the original movie was brilliant. But after the second one they all mingle into one big mess for me. There are far too many parodies out there these days that they have stopped being funny. I guess it is one of those 'too much of a good thing' situations. I have always enjoyed stupid humour. It started when I was a kid and watched the Naked Gun. From then on I always looked out for them. But now it seems they are pushing it too far that it has lost its comedy value. I remember going to the cinema to watch Vampires Suck the whole movie sucked!Anyway back to Scary Movie 5.The movie has a lot of famous faces in, but they are mostly just cameos. They even put the cameo stars on the front cover of the DVD it's as if they knew that no-one would watch this unless it has some decent names attached to it. The main character is played by Ashley Tisdale. I was watching this movie looking at her thinking ""I know her from somewhere"" But I could not remember where I had seen her. Then the nightmare came back to me ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"". It is Sharpay from High School Musical. I tried my best to delete that film from my memory. But to be honest, she didn't do a bad job in this. She was funny in places and can imagine she could be a comedy actress if she had a decent film to be in. The cameo stars were Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Lohan, Snoop Dogg, Terry Crews, Bow Wow, Heather Locklear, Jerry O'Connell & Mike Tyson. That is one hell of a cast list but they are not really on screen long enough for you to appreciate them. In some cases if you blink, you will miss them.This film is not all bad. I was laughing out loud to a few scenes. There were some scenes that were very funny. Just not enough of them. I think the main reason I found them funny is because I have seen the movies they were mimicking.I was also very surprised to see the film was only on for 1 hour 8 minutes (not including the credits). That is very short for a movie and even though it was not a great film I still would have wanted it to go on a bit longer. It felt like they had run out of things to parody so they ended the movie.Overall the film was amusing in places, but I did find myself watching it with a straight face through a lot of the gags. Mainly because they have been done a million times over. I really hope they don't make any more now. I believe this was the final nail in the Scary Movie coffin.I will give this film 5 out of 10.""I'll pay you to get me out of this movie""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Scary Movie V
72,PoisonKeyblade,Hysterically Funny Spoof Film,9,12 April 2013,"It's been 7 years since Scary Movie 4 hit theaters to a pretty impressive box office run, and Scary Movie 5 brings the series back in a big fun way. If you loved the other four films (especially part 3) you will definitely get a kick out of Scary Movie 5. This is a spoof done right, written by David Zucker, the master of slapstick humor. Sure, like any spoof movie there are tons and tons of jokes and some miss the mark. However, Scary Movie 5 succeeds by sticking to its roots and rebooting the entire series for new audiences and old fans alike.The first thing you will probably notice is the rather unfortunate and upsetting lack of Anna Farris. Farris rose to stardom almost exclusively through the Scary Movie films at first, building her comedic repertoire along the way. At the time of filming, Farris was pregnant, so Ashley Tisdale fills Anna's shoes in a surprisingly fulfilling turn. Sure, she's no Cindy Campbell, but Jody is a character you can root for and Tisdale really does prove she has good comic timing. Unfortunately, there is also no Brenda (Regina Hall) or any of the other great characters to be found in the other sequels. For this film, it actually works this circumstance to its advantage, bringing back both Charlie Sheen and Simon Rex as relatives (again) but playing completely different character than their counterparts from the third and fourth installments. Some of the side characters bring the most laughs, from Molly Shannon as Heather to Tyler Posey as a hardcore Christian chilling at a cabin in the woods (long story.) The opening scene rivals the best ones in this series, and the scene fully concludes after the credits roll so stick around for a fun moment and obvious ode to the other four movies. Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen were absolutely perfect choices for the opening and I really missed them once they were gone. Also, I could watch Simon Rex do his awkward comedy schtick for hours and never get bored. Rock on, Dirt Nasty!There are some really nitpicky issues to be found within this feature, but when you are watching a spoof film you really need to switch your brain off to have any fun. There are some odd dubbing issues as far as sound goes where it looks like the actor was saying something else, which most likely was a product of the numerous reshoots this movie underwent to remain more relevant. The Inception and 50 Shades of Grey spoofs kind of fall flat on their faces and bring the movie to a bit of a halt, but they are mere bumps in the road compared to the laughs to be found in the rest of the movie. I'm anxious to see an unrated version of this on DVD to see what was cut out or what footage/spoofs were excised completely from the final product.If spoofs are your thing, there is plenty of hysterical moments to be found within Scary Movie 5, which actually takes chances and doesn't rehash the same material over and over again. This isn't your typical throwaway spoof. Though the ending could have used a bit of polishing (come to think of it, I've never been fully satisfied with an ending apart from the first), the final product is very watchable and has some decidedly off-the-wall moments. I can honestly say I loved Scary Movie 5, and if you're a fan of spoofs you will probably love it too.",Scary Movie V

74,kylehaines96,Scary Movie 5(2013) Film Review,6,27 May 2013,"Rating: **1/2 Out Of ****.Rated PG-13 For Crude And Sexual Content Throughout, Language, Some Drug Material, Partial Nudity, Comic Violence And Gore.1hr 26min/86min.1 use of the F-word.Let me give you my quick opinions of the first four Scary Movies. Scary Movie Was a smart and original concept that was extremely funny. It was a huge hit with audiences and critic's so a sequel was made. Scary Movie 2 was a movie that was not as good as the first but still had a lot of fresh ideas. Scary Movie 3 is my personal favorite with Scary Movie 4 trailing on it's heels. So with talks of a Scary Movie 5 has been in the talks for a few years, and now that we have it, was it worth the wait? Well.. Yes and No. Yes meaning that it is nice to see a new installment in the franchise and No meaning that it doesn't feel like the first 4 due to the absence of The original cast members. That being said, this film isn't terrible, just not as good as the others.The film starts with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan in bed together when they are suddenly interrupted by spiritual/ Paranormal activity going on in the house. Charlie and Lindsay are eventually killed. The story then moves to Jodi(Ashley Tisdale) replacing Cindy, who goes looking for Charlie's three missing children. Her and her husband(Simon Rex) Take in the children who claim that they can make contact with the spirit of their dead mother. In order to vanquish the spirit they need to acquire The Book Of The Dead o reverse the curse that brought their mother up from the dead.Scary Movie 5 Has gags that work(Hence, the thumbs up rating) but some gags that fall flat on their face. When a gag doesn't work in this type of movie, it really doesn't work. This movie isn't going to be the next Ben-Hur, It is strictly meant to entertain. Yes it does have childish gags but once you get past that, It's stupid humor that's their to entertain. The only reason why you wouldn't want to see this is because you didn't like the first 4. That said I would Recommend this as a rental but nothing higher.",Scary Movie V

76,Jonathon_Natsis,Terrifying in all the worst ways.,1,17 May 2013,"It is almost inconceivable to imagine how much effort a group of people would have to put into making a film as bad as Scary Movie 5. The latest instalment in the series of lazy spoofs, not including some unforgivable side projects including Date Movie and Epic Movie, this film offers virtually nothing to its audience, insulting their intelligence for an hour-and-a-half with perhaps the worst collection of blatantly uninspired and recycled gags ever put to celluloid.The film's horrendous excuse for a plot centres on a suburban wife (Ashley Tisdale) and her dimwitted husband (Simon Rex) moving into a haunted house with their possessed adopted children. From there, the film brings its staple of parodying the biggest blockbusters of the last few years, but does so without a semblance of relevance, creativity or wit. It says a lot about the film that the only half-laughs to be had come from Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan sharing the opening scene- an incredibly stupid and borderline cringe-worthy, but inexplicably entertaining chuckle at their fall from grace. It's all downhill from there, though, as the rest of the film plays out as a series of unconnected set pieces seen literally hundreds of times before. Often, such an unappealing movie is still able to salvage some hope by suiting itself for a target market, but it is hard to see any audience group, from 15 year-olds to stoners, defending this abomination.One would have to drink Lindsay under the table, smoke copious amounts of bud with Snoop Dogg and/or Lion and snort pure tiger blood with Charlie to even come close to drawing any semblance of enjoyment from this disaster. An imminent sweep of this year's Razzies doesn't seem like ironic punishment enough for one of the worst films ever made.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

77,metalrage666,Unfunny and Unnecessary,1,31 March 2018,"The stupidity of movie goers never ceases to amaze me. The fact that this drivel made almost 4 times it's overall budget of 20 million is testament to just how many people are prepared to sit through garbage that tries in vain to pass itself off as comedy.
I caught this last offering on TV one night, so thank God I've never spent a penny on seeing any of these at a cinema, but after 5 movies & 13 years later, I don't think I've ever cracked a smile at any part of this franchise that I've managed to see. The obvious and often infantile humour just seems to be getting worse with each subsequent travesty and yet as long as nonsense like this still manages to rake in a profit, we can almost guarantee a never ending run of sequels. We know they'll never run out of movies to do parodies of, right?
In this installment, we're can see renderings of recent Planet of the Apes, Paranormal Activity. Mama, Cabin in the Woods, Evil Dead and I think there's also a segment to Fifty Shades of Grey. Why they threw that in there is anyone's guess, but then again, why they felt this needed to be made at all is actually more of a mystery.
If you've seen any part of the previous 4 movies then you'll just get more lame and unfunny sight gags, toilet humour, sexual double entendre and hackneyed slapstick, so you may as well throw any and all expectations of getting a laugh, (even a cheap one), out the window
Personally I've never found parody comedies to be funny as it doesn't require any talent when ALL of your source material is somebody else's work. For me, these movies would have been funnier had they only used elements of pop culture, instead of relying on celebrity cameos or a character constantly being confused and eye-rolling in nearly every scene. 
Hopefully the negative reaction to #5 will mean that there won't be a #6 unless they decide to reboot the series, (rebooting seems to be the rage these days) but knowing the way the movie world tends to work, there's enough idiotic fans of this so-called humour to keep it going, regardless if it makes a profit or not, so there's something we can all look forward to.",Scary Movie V
78,jtungsten16,This movie was not as bad as people are saying!,10,12 October 2014,"i think Scary Movie 5 was good, I would not say it was great, but it had its moments where it made me laugh, I think the funniest and best part of the movie was Lidia Porta (Maria) she was so funny and a great actress. One of my favorite scenes was the pool vacuum party in the back yard! That was hysterical. This movie reminded me a lot of Airplane the same kind of humor. Scary Movie 5 did its job and entertained us and made us laugh, it was not meant to win any Oscars and it did not deserve all the hate that it got. Scary Movie 5 will always be one of my favorite movies and the bluray version of the DVD is better. Please don't listen to all of the hate and give Scary Movie 5 a chance, I don't think you will be disappointed.",Scary Movie V
79,bravesfanc,How did this get made???,2,21 August 2013,"It's movies like these that make me wonder why normal people can't just put together a story and make a movie. Because honestly, this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The ""Scary Movie"" franchise should've stopped after the first one. I didn't mind the second or third films but this one was by far the worst.A lot of big names are in the movie, mainly Ashley Tisdale who is the main character and I can't believe she read this script and thought ""Wow, this is a great idea"" but hey, she probably made good money. This spoof mixes ""Mama"", ""Paranormal Activity"", ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", ""Black Swan"" and every single horror film with a cabin in the woods, which is quite a bit. And there is one scene where it makes fun of that exact thing which was probably the funniest scene in the film. And that scene was in the first 5 minute.The jokes are horrible and way too over the top. I really don't remember much else because I was too bored to care.",Scary Movie V

But actually, I liked Ashley! She put a fresh spin on the genre and is good at playing crazy. Everyone else? direct-to-DVD level acting. The jokes? Immature, gross, mildly amusing. Actually ""Mama"" and ""Black Swan""'s spoofs steal the show.Clocking at an 80 (last time I checked) minutes, this runs pretty short and without its credits, so if you're hurling at the inaneness of it, it'll be over in no time.Maybe I'm being more lenient on films because I feel I've been too picky, or maybe I'm just having a field day, but I truly believe there are far worse films out there. That's not to say these aren't bad, but for what I was expecting, not that bad. And Lindsay Lohan pretty much MAKES the movie, even though she's in it in the blink of an eye. And for what it's worth, it's actually better than the tepid 3 and 4 of the series.",Scary Movie V

82,themissingpatient,An all-new low,1,7 August 2013,"2013 has had a very serious lack of comedy. What we have been sold in the comedy genre has been embarrassingly bad, low-brow humor or indie dramatic comedies where the film's emotional core always over-shadows any potential laughs. They are cute but rarely deliver true laugh-out-loud moments. As we patiently wait in anticipation for the master of comedy, Adam McKay, to have his newest film, Anchorman 2, released in theaters, we find ourselves desperate for a fix of comedy. This is how we end up watching a film like Scary Movie V.The original Scary Movie was a much needed parody of Scream and all the pathetic slasher film rip-offs that followed. While there were some scenes where the film was trying too hard to be funny, the screenplay flawlessly blended together all the slasher flicks that followed Scream and had it's own original twist ending that took bits from all the best films of the 90's. It was the first good parody film since the 80's when Jim Abrahams and Jerry and David Zucker were working together on such classics as The Naked Gun and Airplane! The poster for Scary Movie had the tagline: No mercy. No shame. No sequel. Yet they didn't just make a shameful sequel, they made 3 of them. Even bringing in David Zucker to take over for Keenen Ivory Wayans as director for parts 3 and 4 didn't help. With every entry in the series, the films only got worse. Even as guilty pleasures to watch with friends for mindless entertainment, they stopped working as all the attempts at jokes were only pop-culture references that quickly became out-dated. We didn't think it could get worse than Scary Movie 4 but we were wrong, dead wrong.Scary Movie V or Scary MoVie takes both film parodies and film itself to an unprecedented new low. While it's safe to say this will be the worse movie of 2013, it is an understatement. It is worse than that. It's one of the worse films to have ever been made and makes Grown-Ups 2 seem Oscar-worthy.",Scary Movie V
83,kols,Review the movie on the screen,10,19 July 2014,"Most of the Scary Movie movies are Dumb, Whacky, fast-paced and slightly Lame - good fits to their genre, meeting everybody's expectations.This one's a little different. It's got a brain.The basics are all there with one exception: instead of throwing all the shtick at you in manic fast cuts (what ye laugh at sticks, wa ye nae, nae), Scary Movie V slows everything down. The individual scenes are still short and focused, still basically scatter-shot but very, very slowly paced compared to the genre norm.The opening skit, a Charlie Sheen parody staring Charlie Sheen, epitomizes the pacing and tone, throwing in such staples as outrageous misdirection (the DVDs and cameras), a Benny Hill fast-forward pseudo-sex bit and tons of double entendres. All elements stated in a sedate 2/2 pace steadfast to the end.Another difference - the movie's skits are intelligent. The constant references to other movies are on the mark, like the Snoop Dog bit with Cabin in the Woods being referenced as 'cabin in the woods (generic)' instead of Cabin in the Woods (the movie): Snoop and his buddy driving each other nuts running that loop. Another way of putting it, most of the skits are multi-layered rather than single dimensioned, quick jokes.In short, this not your run-of-the mill Scary Movie. Its humor is dry, its pacing is sedate and the theater isn't going to collapse from all the belly laughs. A good wine to be savored, not endless shots of cheap whiskey for a fast drunk.The only negative: the narration. Script is fine, voice-over is distracting. They should of stuck to UberScript.Giving it a ten because none of the shtick fails (except the narration), violating another genre convention - the point of fast-cut, fast-paced scatter-shot bits: hiding (or over shooting) the shtick that doesn't work.And, as I replay it for this review, stuff like the Vacuum Cleaner Pool Party and the Planet of the Apes bit gets better. Hell, all the shtick gets better second time around. Easy to see how anyone expecting the usual, run-of-the-mill Scary Movie would be disappointed and, perhaps, angry at this radical departure from the norm BUT ReviewTMOTScreen. Or just say, or scream, This Isn't A Scary Movie! and leave it at that instead of trashing the movie you haven't really been watching.P.S I'm not a laugh out loud kind of person - I've never laughed in a theater or at home - and, first time around, while I appreciated the nuanced bits, no belly laughs. Then, as I began finishing the above review (while second-viewing), felt little up-turns at the corners of my lips, followed by actual chuckles as I anticipated each of the 'Shave and a Haircut, Two Bits!' bits I remembered from first-time-around.Shocking! I finished and submitted the review and then had a third go at it. Smile and chuckles returned, triggered by particularly clever twists-on-expectations, played in all-in-innocence deadpan.I may be the only person who feels this way (fine, my prerogative) but SMV is a total gem.",Scary Movie V

85,s_campanale,Mama meets Paranormal Activity 2 meets Rise of Planet of the Apes meets Black Swan meets Inception meets Evil Dead - And has a Hell of a party!,10,1 May 2013,"This is a review from a die-hard ""Scary Movie"" lover (who had to be initially dragged to see part 1 but became suddenly converted) so do not expect it to be neutral!The ""Scary Movie"" series is one of those franchises born at the turn of the century that inexplicably keeps on going and going (""Underworld"" ""Resident Evil"" and ""Fast & Furious"" come to mind, all private family run cash cows for their stars and directors).Unloved from its inception with the original Wayans Brothers ""Scary Movie"" in 2000, these films carry on the glorious tradition of the bawdy sexy parody of popular serious works of the moment, something that has been going on as long as the seven arts themselves, and in cinema since its beginning. Now in its third film under the tutelage of the grand master (if one excludes Mel Brooks) of the genre David ""Airplane"" Zucker, and directed by another parody master Malcolm D. Lee, this fifth instalment as ever cross-sections the plots of various popular horror and Sci-Fi movies of the last few years. The main thread is based on the recent Gulliermo Del Toro produced ""Mama"" (Here all those disgruntled horror fans finally get the purely evil Edith Eames they all wanted along with a conventional corny ""happy ending"" version of the cliff-top finale rather than the tragi-poetic one they all hated) intermixed with the web-cam horror of ""Paranormal Activity"" (part 2 in particular). The couple at the centre of this conjoined domestic paranormal invasion are played by returning SM star Simon Rex, playing the Kostner-Waldau part while the Jessica Chastain role is taken by former child star Ashley Tisdale, who in a magnificently inspired moment is literally ""stripped"" of Chastain's infamous Punky Goth look, while the Elizabeth and Victoria child roles are taken by the very talented youngsters Gracie Witton and Ava Kolker, who match the adult stars gag for gag. They are joined by the very funny Lidia Porto, who is not afraid of making fun of herself as the superstitious Latin Maid from ""PA2"", and steals almost every scene she is in. Both also have sub-plots that bring in 2 other 2011 blockbusters (I suspect this film started life in 2011 and was then resumed with up to the second stuff) with Rex taking James Franco's role in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" creating super intelligent ape Caesar (who also helps out with the ghostly goings on but only suffers repeated violence for his pains) in the lab. Tisdale on the other hand takes Natalie Portman's role in an extended spoof on Aronofksy' risible ""Black Swan"" (a film already so much a burlesque parody that it is an achievement in itself to be able to mock it so well here) that introduces us to Erica Ash as Kendra, - Mila Kunis role in the original – who becomes her sidekick and friend (as well as lover and rival as per BS) as well as J.P Manoux doing a delicious take on Vincent Cassel's director and Molly Shannon capturing only too well Winona Ryder's embittered alcoholic ex- prima ballerina. Also included are skits on ""Inception"" –gamely done considering that ""Inception satirizing"" has become a sort of mini-industry- that go into loving detail for key scenes and feature lookalikes Ben Cornish and Kate Walsh standing in for De Caprio and Cotillard and a side splitting riff on ""The Evil Dead"" (both remake and original) that sees the girls reading of the Necromicon induce horrific acts of self-mutilation amongst a group of Christian students trying to detox their own Mia from Energy Shots, only to be left in pieces when the spell is undone (they don't magically regenerate as in the Alvarez version!)Starting and ending (stay to the end of the credits for a final scene) with actual Scary Movie veteran Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan playing up their recent lifestyle disasters in a ""Paranormal Activity"" skit that turns into a full blown acrobatic routine featuring look-alike performers and even circus clowns!The humour in the film is surprisingly rather old fashioned and ""Vaudevillian"". Gone are most of the gross out and ""ghetto"" gags from the earlier instalments (save a brilliant bit of screwball two-handing from rappers Snoop Dogg and Bow-Wow who play the hunters that find the girls in the cabin) to be replaced by the traditional ""Zucker"" weapons of machine-gun puns,verbal gags and visual/physical humour – people being hit on the head, kicked in the balls, falling off ladders, gags involving beds, stairs, catching fire, falling down, being by spooked by pop up books, etc. It returns to the style of ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"" and despite what critics are saying is actually both the best made Scary Movie (if that's also the funniest I don't know?) and the funniest Zucker parody of recent years. With the departure of original stars Anna Faris and Regina Hall in the 6 year interval since part 4, Tisdale and Ash have stepped into their roles and are clearly being set up as the future itineration of their ""Dumb white chick-Sleazy Ghetto Black Chick"" double act. They are quite different in how they play their roles (more understated, less showy) but both have great talent and if the series continues then hopefully we will be seeing them again soon.The film initially proved a misfire, but take has been steadily increasing, and besides its main life will be on DVD and download, where the money will be made.

87,GTeixeira,"Embarrassingly bad, from the cast to the spoofs; the franchise reaches a new low",1,10 August 2013,"The fifth installment of the popular horror spoof franchise, 'Scary MoVie' is shameful in its badness. With a spoof consisting of mainly 'Mama' and the 'lost footage' horrors, as well as many non-horror films (such as 'Black Swan' or 'Rise of the Planet of Apes'), it is outclassed in every way by 'A Haunted House'.The 'Scary Movie' franchise, while very fun, tends to lose a bit of strength in each next movie. This time around it is the absence of Anna Faris and Regina Hall, the only regulars since the first one, that brings it down a lot. Instead, the new cast is atrocious. Ashley Tisdale, of the 'High School Musical' (in)fame, is completely lacking in both the funny, acting or charisma departments; Erica Ash is even more atrocious, and tries too hard to be a substitute for Regina Hall but falls flat; Simon Rex, a returner from the third and fourth films, is likable but ends up far too silly to work. Lidia Porto is another particularly full of bad moments, while the kids are surprisingly better than the adult cast.And what is there to say about Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan? Their cartoonishly goofy scene at the beginning almost had me giving up on watching.The jokes fall flat most of the times. Some of the ideas had potential, but were too badly handled to work. In particular, the 'Evil Dead' and 'Black Swan' spoofs and the scenes involving Snoop Dog (Lion?) could have been great; but the first two ended up too stupid to work, whereas the last one was just too dry/badly acted.The closest to a saving grace this movie has is the 'Inception' spoof, which might be the only moment I laughed at all, and the fact this is a relatively short film at only 86 minutes long. This was just embarrassingly bad.",Scary Movie V
88,jsucie,Hollywood cash grab,4,8 June 2021,"This movie is the culmination of comedic era headed straight into the dumpster brought on by the Hollywood Cash Grab Machine. This franchise and its subsequent spin offs started strong with the first 2 Scary Movie films, Date Movie, & at the bottom Epic Movie; then everything really went down hill as more and more got pumped out like Meet the Spartans, Vampires Suck, Disaster Movie, Superhero Movie, & the rest to follow in the spoof category. It's a shame really because with proper innovative writing there should have been many better spoof movies to be made with so much content to pull from and make fun of.Now for this movie, it is simply meh. There's a couple of chuckles here and there but mostly you'd have to be 13 and this is the first comedy you've ever seen to enjoy this really. A shame really because it does have quite a few talented comedic actors in it but I think they went to a junior high and asked them to pen the script or the ""adult"" writers were far too baked at work.",Scary Movie V
89,JamesIan2021,A Weak Addition,3,20 May 2015,"Ashley Tisdale does her absolute best but even she can't save this film from mediocrity. In this fifth instalment, slapstick runs rather dry and many, many gags outstay their welcome. Hits like Inception, Black Swan and Mama are spoofed earning some healthy laughs but many dated cultural references and pop culture gags fall flat, this isn't as bad as the first two Scary Movie films but it's certainly one of the weakest, reaching to the bottom of the barrel in desperation. Scary MoVie sees young parents Dan and Jody raise their adopted nieces who have a twisted spirit overlooking them. Jody begins to experience paranormal activity in their new home, and soon realises an evil dead demon is stalking them, Jody must now venture to the cabin in the woods to find the book of the dead and stop the deadly curse, whilst Dan focuses on his job at the Ape research facility. The problem here is too many big films are being spoofed, from Inception, Black Swan, Mama, Evil Dead, Paranormal Activity, Insidious, The Cabin In The Woods, even Tyler Perry's Madea and Fifty Shades Of Grey. Writers David Zucker and Pat Proft cram it all in, the film is bursting at its seams with a lot of bad jokes and a feeling of desperation. The scenes where Simon Rex falls over whilst trying to set up the cameras drove me mental as it wasn't funny, the fight between Dan and Rosa, and the repetition of the Cabin in the woods joke fizzled out quicker than you can say boring. The dancing Mama and the Ape's talking about Matt Damon really killed hope, there's so much that falls flat, the Fifty Shades Of Grey scene was pointless and the Inception scene really felt forced. However, the whole Black Swan sequences work superbly, the Evil Dead book scene was hilarious and the opening with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan ripping their personal lives maybe lousy but it works. Erica Ash is superb as Kendra, J.P. Manoux is very funny as Pierre the ballet teacher, and Molly Shannon reels out some big laughs as a broken, alcoholic smoking professional dancer, there are some great jokes here, Ashley Tisdale is great at slapstick and she echoes an Anna Faris in the making, although Faris cannot be beat when it comes to these films. The found footage aspects are decent, especially when exploring their new home, seeing Jody smack the baby into the door frame, setting its head on fire then blasting fire extinguishers reign madness, it's unapologetically poor humour but I chuckled. Running in at under feature length, Scary Movie 5 feels long and exhausting, it tries to be something big but it really is just a squashed mixed bag labelled as a movie, and Director Malcolm D. Lee does nothing to polish or let alone add craft to this tiresome spoof.",Scary Movie V

We stuck it out only to discover the rest of the film was also flat. The jokes were not clever, and the comedic performances felt amateur(especially Linsey Lohan). I felt that a big missing park of this movie was the soundtrack.

The acting was awful and the effects (audio and visual) were laughable to say the least. I mean, this movie seemed like it was literally pulled from the trash and put in the theaters. The first Scary Movie wasn't half bad, but holy crap this series has gone done quicker than Lindsey Lohan's career. I just really don't know what else to say, the movie had absolutely no entertainment value of any kind, anywhere in the film.While I understand this movie is a parody and is supposed to be a ""so bad it's good"" movie, someone could make a parody of this movie it's so bad.

And second, the film ""Jeepers Creepers"" exists so it will just barely avoid the title of worst movie ever made...at least in this reviewer's humble opinion. The earlier films in this series, while not award winning, could at least generate a few good laughs...but my lord, this is just an awful film no matter how you cut the mustard. Dragged out potty humor jokes that rely on something a first grader MIGHT slightly chuckle at, a parade of has- been B-listers who try to make fun of themselves but clearly appear to the viewer that they are in the movie only to pay off their taxes and lawyer fees, and sight-gags that quite frankly....just fail. A keg party of robot pool cleaners??? A very large woman in a thong bikini??? Food made of human waste?? An ape on the toilet??? These are the ""high point"" funny moments. If this kind of stuff is what you enjoy, fear not, I'm sure you'll find this one in the $5.00 bin at Wal*Mart in the very near future.

And, in this case the book 50 Shades of Grey gets a look in with the unlikely pairing of Jerry O'Connell & Mike Tyson appearing opposite Ashley Tisdale in that sequence. My highlights were the Black Swan & ongoing Paranormal Activity rip offs, especially the pool cleaner party. Look at it this way, it's mindless fun, better with a beer in hand. It has it's moments and for those who care, stay on AFTER THE CREDITS for an extra scene.

All you need is to base the story on few recent and successful high budget movies, make fun of everything and everyone in the most ridiculous ways, have action/horror which mostly leads to comedy which in this case leads to very bad comedy, sexy girls and everything else you would expect from a parody.It took them 7 years to finally release another Scary movie. My expectations were low but I didn't realize it would be this bad. It has maybe a few funny moments but the rest of it for me was just painful to watch. I managed to watch it all despite that. I tried to watch it as open-minded I as I possibly could but overall the movie feels like it trying too hard and usually doesn't achieve the goal it pursues. I liked the original few movies of the franchise. They are not good but not too terrible. They are kinda alright and even watchable after all these years but this wasn't and feels like the Scary movie magic is gone.Overall I think a lot of people will not enjoy it and a small portion will. Personally, after watching the original movie this feels like the worst parody I have ever seen so it's a 2 out of 10 and only because I liked one scene otherwise it would be a 1/10

In this one, most of the cast from the previous movies are absent. That's not a good sign. In this one, we get parodies of more recent movies, like Paranormal Activity, Mama, Rise of the Planet of the Apes and ... The Shawshank Redemption? Oh well, only two of those are horror movies, but oh well...I'm gonna cut right to the chase. This movie is not horrible. If you thought the previous ones were funny, you're gonna think this one is funny. In fact, I find Scary Movie V to be one of the funnier movies in the series. That may be because I've seen most of the movies parodied in this one, as opposed to the other ones where there's only a couple parodies per movie I actually get.Anyways, back to the point: Everyone seems to hate this movie, and I say: What do you except? Do you really want a clever comedy with smart humor and jokes that you are gonna remember your whole life? No. The Scary Movies are stupid. Some of the stupidest movies ever, but that doesn't matter, because they know it. They don't try to make it good, they're just making another Scary Movie.I think a lot of people have forgotten to have mindless fun with comedies. Everyone expects a comedy to be memorable these days. Yes, this movie's not the most fun you'll have in the theater, but it is a fun movie to watch with friends none-the-less.Again, if you like the other Scary Movies, there's no reason not to watch this one: It's pretty much a modern take on the same formula that's been going on for 13 years now.

103,YungRapunxel212,I miss the old ones.,5,15 April 2013,"This is the worst ""Scary Movie"" yet, for many reasons. Reason 1 - Brenda isn't back! Brenda was played by Regina Hall in the first four films, and she wasn't in this one! Yeah, Anna Faris isn't in it either, but Brenda was the best character! She was the funniest one! Reason 2 - Two people who died in ""Scary Movie 4"" were back. They played different people though. They were Charlie Sheen and Simon Rex. It was funny, but it should have been rated R. There is the bottom of a butt, nonstop sexual stuff, and one clear use of the f word, and the n word, used by the physic. If you are a big fan of the franchise, you should go see it, and if you never heard of the series, you can go, because it is not a continuation.Recommended for 15+",Scary Movie V
104,naregian,I almost regret not walking out of the theater.,3,13 April 2013,"The era of spoof and parody is dead.Let me start off by saying that I knew this film was going to be horrible from the start. I had read reviews and knew it was bad, but being so infatuated with film and theater, I actually wanted to see the movie to diagnose exactly what made it so horrible. (Insult me if you must, but I have a lot of free time on my hands and I love all kinds of movies.)I'm not gonna lie, I went into the theater with the hope that on some slight chance, I would enjoy the film. Wrong. The movie was so boring and tasteless that I was actually distracted with my phone for some parts during the film, which is of the utmost rarity for me. The horrible acting and line delivery dried this film out so much that I don't know where to begin. Ashley Tisdale was definitely not as good as Anna Faris was, and obviously, everyone will compare the two. I hate to admit it, but Mac Miller, Snoop Dogg, and Katt Williams all could have made audiences laugh with the material they were given, but were just too dry. Admittedly, there were some very rare parts of the movie that had a somewhat witty humor to it, but it was only once or twice, and weak at that. The rest of the stupid slapstick humor was just so lame and dragging. Slapstick humor should stay within the PG level of humor for the kids. On that note, the movie had overly crude, and just STUPID sexual humor that was just stupid and weak. Even hard R teenage sex comedies are more sophisticated than this. I laughed maybe one time, and it wasn't even a laugh. I kinda exhaled sharply while smiling. Overall, there was almost no sophisticated or witty humor, horrid acting, and it was all just plain bad. So yes, the reviews are correct, it was horrible. The only reason I give it a 3 instead of a 1 was because hundreds and hundreds of people put months and months of work into an 85 minute piece of what they thought was art, and giving a movie a 1 or maybe a 2 is too disrespectful to the art that is film. (But then again, this movie is pretty disrespectful to the art that is film as well.)",Scary Movie V

106,jeffrey-utley,This Movie Wasn't Horrible,1,8 July 2013,"Fans liked 'Scary Movie and 'Scary Movie 2' when they came out in 2000 and 2001. After that the director was changed and in 2003 'Scary Movie 3' came out, which fans didn't like, even though it had a higher budget and bigger cast. The budget was even higher for 'Scary Movie 4', which came out 2006, which fans hated. 'Scary Movie 5' was meant to come out in October or 2008, but that never happened. Now, from the same writers of 'Scary Movie 3' and 'Scary Movie 4', comes 'Scary Movie 5', the real release date. It's not called 'Scary MoVie'. I don't know why it's called that on IMDb. Anyway, since it had a failed release date, didn't have a real one until five years after the failed one, and was from the same writers of two movies that did poorly with fans and critics, the expectations were very low for this movie... But it still had a negative 4% Rotten Tomatoes critic score, and a 57% user score, which was also negative, but almost positive. I really didn't think this movie that horrible.This movie was stupid... It was very very stupid. There were many, many jokes in this movie, which was a bad thing. The jokes were almost all from the same humor. It was very strange humor. The humor was funny, but not hilarious. The humor also got old very quick. Since it went on so long, and didn't really change, it had a clear path to get old quickly, and it did. The jokes were also all over the place, and sometimes they would drag on too long and not be funny anymore. Sometimes there would be many things happen in a row that were too similar to be funny, even the second time. I don't dislike stupid humor, but there's a right way to do stupid humor, and they didn't pull it off very well.Getting past that the humor was stupid and the same and all of the other faults I found in it, 'Scary Movie 5' was a funny movie. At the beginning, when the humor wasn't old yet, and some other parts in the movie, I laughed most of the time. The jokes still lingered for a while in some of the funny parts, but the beginnings of the jokes would be enjoyable. Even though the humor stayed the same in the movie, They changed what they were making fun of several times. Some of the times it matched the movies they made fun of, and sometimes it didn't. When the humor and jokes hit the movie spoofs they matched, 'Scary Movie 5' would be funny and enjoyable then. They could never pull off a very long portion of the enjoyable parts, though. It would only pick up for a few scenes, then go back to the usually unfunny parts. It switched movies several times, though, so it would always come back around. This movie had many funny parts, like in one scene I laughed and laughed and laughed. They had pulled it off right. The writers set up the right things in the movie to poke fun at and make fun of with the right humor, almost perfectly. But the jokes stayed the same, so eventually it died down.The verdict on this movie is that it was alright. I mean that as It was not bad, but I didn't necessarily like it. I was gonna rate this movie as a 5/10, but I walked out thinking positively of it. I understand why someone wouldn't like this movie, though.",Scary Movie V

I actually sometimes enjoy watching the first two Scary Movies, but this one is just so bad. It's not even funny! I thought we already got our horror parody of the year with A Haunted House like yesterday. Scary Movie 5 is even worse than that. It's written terribly, it's acted terribly, it's jokes are terrible. The movie relies on poop and fart jokes; c'mon, that's too stupid. I only laughed for about 2 minutes, during the Inception part of the film. But even that was just a small smirk-type laugh. That's sad for a movie that's supposed to make people laugh out loud. All in all, I really don't want to talk about this movie anymore. It's stupid, unfunny, and unnecessary",Scary Movie V
110,nikozguri,Oh my god!,1,16 May 2013,"So, ""Scary Movie 5"".. it's just ""Scary Movie 5"". Which is funny, cause before it came out, i thought ""Scary Movie 5"" was kinda like ""A Haunted House"", and i thought OK, that's ""Scary Movie 5"". I don't wanna see it, and i don't wanna talk bout it. And sometimes it's fun to talk bout a movie that's terrible. This movie's FREAKING TERRIBLE!!! Alright, so in ""Scary Movie 5"" they spoof Mama, Paranormal Activity 4, but they don't just spoof horror movies. They also spoof Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Inception, ya these kinda movies. At the start of this movie, we see Charlie Sheen banging Ashley Tisdale, and then they get killed in the beginning, then a text comes up and it's like ""Charlie Sheen's body was found in October 27. His body didn't stop partying"" or something. Ya, the only funny part in the movie is in text form! What the hell is that supposed to mean?! Like there's a segment where they spoof ""Mama"": the little kids like ""Don't look in the closet!"" Ashley goes at the closet, opens the door and we see the maid on the toilet. And she farts, flies of the toilet and hits Ashley Tisdale. Right there, i was like ""What was that?"" The thing i don't get is: Why's there a toilet in the closet in the kid's bedroom? They put the toilet there so then they can have that moment, that's not funny at all. And they also spoof the ""Evil Dead"" remake, that came out 1 week before this movie came out. Which is why i believe that the production of ""Scary Movie 5"" a week before it came out. The execution's sloppy, the script's terrible. It's just filled with stupid jokes that u just don't care about. It's not funny at all. You just look at it and go ""Why am i here?""

To discover what is in the minds of the writers who banged their skulls together writing this comedy one can speculate if they are all right. I'd never thought Ashley Tisdale would want to be associated with a movie similar to this one, however, she acted just decent enough for the 'Scary movies' absurd life atmosphere, not to mention Simon Rex, as disoriented as usual but yet so funny having brought this with him in every 'Scary movie' he has appeared in. As of young age i was enjoying these flicks already, so i felt the urge to watch it for old times sake. Needless to say, it's a laughable movie, yet a brainless one.",Scary Movie V

Thats ridiculous and blatant sabotage against the idea of the movie and probably the whole series. If your a horror fan you will get all the jokes which in this one refers to Evil Dead, Paranormal Activity and few more references to other big films like year such as Black Swan, Planet Of The Apes etc.Very funny from start to finish, was surprised to see Mac Miller and Snoop do their part near the beginning and end... was funny. Charlie Sheen is only in this movie at the very start not throughout the rest.

114,lukehere99,Scary MoVie = Scary Movie 5,4,17 September 2013,"The first Scary Movie was decent. It didn't deserve a sequel let alone 4! Scary Movie 3 was alright, mainly because they had replaced the foul juvenile Wayans brothers with the writer of Airplane! and The Naked Gun. Getting rid of the scatological crude humor and bringing in the cleverer intelligent laughs worked. But Scary MoVie is just as bad possibly even worse than the sickening antics of Scary Movie 2.Usually in a review I would do a summary of the plot. But the writers of Scary MoVie haven't got time for plots! Ashley Tisdale and Simon Rex adopt some weird kids, movie into a new house and vulgar toilet jokes ensue. The weird kids are obviously meant to be like the weird kids from Mama. (SPOOF NUMBER ONE). And Simon Rex works at an ape training lab, which is meant to be like Rise of the Planet of the Apes. (SPOOF NUMBER TWO). His girlfriend Ashley Tisdale is a ballet dancer who is trying to keep the lead role of The Dying Swan which is meant to be like Black Swan. (SPOOF NUMBER THREE).When their asleep loads of jump scares and loud noises are happening, all while being filmed with surveillance cameras. That's meant to be like the Paranormal Activity franchise. (SPOOF NUMBER FOUR). At the beginning of the movie Snoop Dog and some other guy (who looks like Macklemore but isn't Macklemore) are going through a forest and find an old cabin in the woods, that's meant to be like you guessed it The Cabin In The Woods. (SPOOF NUMBER FIVE). Later on Ashley Tisdale goes to the cabin in the woods and a bunch of teenagers are there. There all praising religion and singing cheerful songs, which is the exact opposite of what they do in The Evil Dead. (SPOOF NUMBER SIX). A Morgan Freeman soundalike is narrating the movie, which is meant to be like all those movies which Morgan Freeman has narrated. (SPOOF NUMBER SEVEN). When Ashley Tisdale starts having messed up dreams she gets a dream specialist to help her out. The dream specialist looks exactly like Leonardo Di Caprio from Inception, they even have the bit where he's explaining everything at a cafe. (SPOOF NUMBER EIGHT). And finally for one reason or another Ashley Tisdale ends up in a bedroom about to bang with Christian Grey. That's meant to be like the book 50 Shades of Grey. (SPOOF NUMBER NINE).So there are 9 different spoofs in an 86 minute movie. That's something like 1 spoof every 8 minutes. When a movie copies a scene or a concept from another movie but adds in some sh*t jokes, it doesn't make a parody it makes a sh*tty mess!To makes matters worse all of the characters in the movie are annoying and deserve to die. I was trying to think of someone who was likable and appeared in Scary MoVie. But they don't exist! Simon Rex's character wasn't too bad at the start, but he got so stupid it was unbearable. This is just another 21st century spoof movie - not funny at all! There hasn't been an above average spoof movie since 1994 when the third Naked Gun movie came out. It seems to be no longer possible!Overall I give Scary MoVie 4/10 for 7 laughs throughout the whole 86 minute movie, mainly because of the mildly amusing narrator.",Scary Movie V

Then, other reviewers spend better than 2/3rds of its review discussing the plot and why it may be flawed. Then they score it a one.This movie is very funny. This movie is often clever. Tisdale and Rex execute clever stuff beautifully. No doubt in my mind they will live up to good scripts and make bad scripts watchable,,--- No doubt.Do not press the play button with an edgy mood that fosters political correctness and inappropriate expectations, (whatever inappropriate expectations may be) or innovative genius.

If you have not seen the movies it is parodying then you are less likely to find it as funny or really understand the jokes to their full extent.

The choice of actors was completely wrong and the acting itself is completely wrong for the most part. The parodies of the movie itself are completely wrong and so apparent, that it takes the whole joy out of watching this. At least the other Scary Movies had that bit of mystery which sort of left you guessing which movie they were making fun of and sometimes it was downright in your face, but here it is just 100% clear what they are doing and sometime don't even bother changing character names or change some of the events (such as Mama, for example) If Anna Faris or any of the other cast members had been involved in this, the movie could have been a bit enjoyable, as it stands, it may mean the end of the franchise.",Scary Movie V

The first one was great, the second was kind of good, the third was hilarious and the fourth was good.There are so many things that don't make sense in this movie. I didn't crack a smile the WHOLE 86 minutes. I'm being dead serious. It's not even funny because I wasted precious time of my life, but that's what happens when they make very bad movie attempts.I still have a few questions on my thoughts though... What happened to the movie parodies they used to do? Did they run out of ideas? Why is it so unoriginal, boring and stupid? What's with all the celebrities that don't fit in? Is this a celebrity hangout or something? Who would want to watch that? Is it time to end the scary movie saga here?If anybody is kind enough to answer my questions I would really appreciate it..I'm telling you right now I would have more fun watching a rhino taking a dump.

125,Oer-6,The disappointing breaking point,1,8 October 2014,"The poisonous humor of the Scary Movie spin-offs has seeped into the Scary Movie franchise and destroyed it from within. Epic Movie and Disaster Movie are the worst of the spin-offs and this one is pushing the limits of being grouped in the same category. I found Scary Movie 1 and 2 hilarious. Scary Movie 3 and 4 were also funny. When I heard about this I had hopes and doubts. Unfortunately it turned out like the bad spin-offs. Date Movie was OK... This one was not. I prefer A Haunted House over this one.I hoped that the days of the Scary Movies were not over. But after 4 years now it seems more likely that this fifth movie killed the Scary Movie franchise.Still it's not as bad as Epic Movie and Disaster Movie. I think. It's hard to compare bad movies. And I don't really have the need. I did however, have the need to share my distinction between Scary Movie 1-4 and 5. Bottom line is: IT'S NOT THE SAME AS THE OTHERS! And it most likely spelled the end of the franchise. Which is sad and disappointing. Even though we will always have the memorable and hilarious quadrilogy before this one. The other movies had some lame sections which were survivable. But this whole movie is a lame section. I'm putting all my hopes in the new ""A Haunted House"" franchise.

They seemed to have this pressing need to explain, or overly set up every joke, so it's just unfunny by the end..The opening: Having sheets jump up and down in fast forward with Benny Hill music, clowns and animals underneath is just not funny. It's playing on 1970's cliché sexual humor, in a really, really bad ""Missing the point of the original joke"" way. There was absolutely nothing about the opening sequence that was funny in any way shape or form. Especially having Charlie Sheen fly through the air and hitting the camera, it wasn't really done in a comical way.The Middle bit: Complete and utter crap.

128,XanderDevil,Scary Movie 5 follows in the footsteps of its predecessors,7,12 April 2013,"Scary Movie 5 is a parody movie comprised of slapstick humor, whimsical characters, and celebrity satire. The movie is done in the same vain as all the other Scary Movies. I think that Scary Movie 5 is one of the better movies in the series, Scary Movie 3 being my favorite one. The movie is over-the-top and there is hardly anything witty about the humor or writing. Some of the scenes are ridiculous enough to come out of a child's imagination. Or maybe a child's imagination would have resulted in better quality humor than what was presented in this movie. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this movie, even though I know that the jokes are childish, over-the-top, and exaggerated. I have always enjoyed movies within this genre, movies such as the Scary Movies and The Comebacks. Meanwhile, I am not one to enjoy other exaggerated movies, like Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. I am not sure why such movies appeal to me more than others. If I had to come up with a reason why I liked the Scary Movies is parody: I like the satirical and ironic imitations that are intrinsic of parody. The difference between this movie and the others is, for a lack of better word, subtlety. In previous movies, especially the first two movies, there are a lot of jokes related to disgusting events or disfigured and disturbing people. The first movie had an explicit over- the-top sex scene. The fifth installment's sex scene used more figurative imagery to represent what went on. A disfigured man in the second movie was the basis of a lot of jokes. Here, the only thing that comes close to that is a genetically-enhanced ape that is parodying The Rise of the Planet of the Apes.I like Scary Movie 5 because of its parodies of movies, its slapstick humor, its whimsical characters, and celebrity satire. I am overlooking stupidity and the exaggeration because it does not bother me at all: I expect it as part of the movie.",Scary Movie V

Along with The Naked Gun and Airplane, this series tops my list for one of the best...comedy wise. So naturally I came in expecting to laugh from the opening scene to the concluding scene and into the famous Scary Movie credits and bloopers. I was met with a few laughs in the opening to just a few laughs throughout the entire movie. I was more grossed-out by the constant usage of sex in this particular Scary Movie, the others had sex no doubt...but not to this degree.I felt as if the actors weren't pressured enough to be witty and humorous. It could be that they just didn't want to try, but I felt with other movies the actors were really making an effort to be funny and witty. In some instances, the actors in this movie looked to be just reciting the line and not giving it any appreciation whatsoever.Certain parts in the movie like the ""Black Swan"" story had a genuine playful attitude that I could pick up on, and I appreciated that. Only if they rest of the story was like this I wouldn't be writing this review.I feel like people would be a better laugh if we return to the comedy of the classics such as Airplane, The Naked Gun, and even the first 4 movies of this franchise! I found it odd that David Zucker couldn't redo what he had done with the oldies, but I guess he has just lost his touch in the industry.",Scary Movie V

But with this one I just couldn't seem to get into it , my first attempt at watching it I turned it off after 5 minutes because the scene with Lindsey Lohan (Why?!) and Charlie Sheen was not remotely funny. And it kind of put me off , because in all the others the opening scene normally gives you a few cheap giggles.Second attempt turned it off after snoop dog (or should I say snoop lion?) and his friend are talking about a baby shampoo on their genitals. (not very long after the Lohan and Sheen scene)Third attempt (once again not long after the snoop lion scene) when Ashley tilsdale is doing a pregnancy test on her IphoneFourth attempt When they move into the 'test subject house'5th and final attempt Not long into them moving into the test subject house.In the 30 odd minutes I viewed I didn't laugh once , I remember thinking why , why ruin such a good movie franchise whyyyyyy?!The characters had me thinking of a few questions tooCharlie Sheen - Why? Lindsay Lohan - Why? Why? Why? Dear God Why? Snoop Dog/Lion - Random , Why? Ashley Tisdale - Why? She's a Disney actress and a shocking one at that , so why give her lead role in a movie franchise as big as scary movie.Truly appalling , save your money , and your time - you'd honestly have more fun watching paint dry.

The Scary Movie series should have ended either on the second or third movie. I've found this review online which practically sums up my opinion on this movie: ""How bad is it? SCARY MOVIE 5 is so bad that the two best performances in the film come from Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan, and they're both out of the movie within five minutes. I'm not saying they're good in it. They're awful. It just so happens their level of awfulness is slightly above anyone else unfortunate enough to be part of the cast.

However Scary Movie 5 doesn't make sense, doesn't make you laugh and has terrible acting.Like everybody else in the Cinema, i did not laugh once (Apart from laughing at how bad it was) I left the cinema unsatisfied and unwilling to ever watch it again.Scary Movie is one of the worst films I have ever seen and definitely will never be seen by me again.",Scary Movie V

This is pretty much the way all of the 'Scary Movies' have gone. Flashes of brilliance amid a lot of unfunny filler. The highest praise I can offer this one is that since they use none of the original characters (but a few familiar faces in the cast) they could release it without crediting Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer anywhere on it.

David Zucker kinda lost his writing skills after a a gap of 7 years between 4 and 5, or is it the other writer's fault? The Paranormal Activity spoof was nice and it being connected to MAMA was great, but how it delivers its comedy was blech... And WHY THE HEL DID THEY INCLUDE RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES?! I mean, it's a good movie, but it's not good enough to be a SCARY MOVIE. Adding the Evil Dead into the movie was funny but it's too short, while Black Swan was heavily parodied, including the Lesbian Scenes, Uh, we don't need those, okay? And the climax of the movie, BOY IT REALLY SUCKS, they could've done better, but MAMA FALLING INTO A SHARK INFESTED JACUZZI? SUUUUUCKS. Moving on to the Characters, Ashley Tisdale was good at her part but not enough to make it totally funny, and Also Simon Rex. To sum it all up, Scary MoVie is a comedy that'll only make you wanna watch it if you're a fan of the series. Comedy is 3/10 Storyline is 1/10",Scary Movie V

One of the star in my rating was because of the 2 laughs I got and the other one was that it wasn't like the Jason and Aaron movies.The laugh I got was from Snoop Dogg and Mac Miller. I was surprised that Mac Miller would make me laugh because I can't get into his music. The other laugh I got was when the husband and the maid fought on the front yard.Are you seriously going to parody ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" when that is not even a movie yet? This movie was already late to the party when they parody ""Inception"", ""Black Swan"", ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" and ""Madea"" You also put Ted in the poster? He is not even in the movie! If he was, it wouldn't even had been clever. It would have been a cheap CGI version of him or a little guy in a god awful Ted costume. I bet that they filmed the parody of ""Evil Dead"" right before they released it. There was another joke about the pool machine cleaners having a party. That really feel flat.

Its hard to believe how this film was even made and whats more shocking is that the actors actually thought it would be a good idea to be in it.I will point out that i am not a huge fan of horror films so i may not have a great knowledge on some of the movies being parodied. I shouldn't and wouldn't expect a movie like this to be 10/10 as it is just a silly parody movie and i have seen the others in the series. The writing was okay in the previous ones and there were definitely laughs throughout but this one the writing is awful and the movie relies heavily on slapstick humour. I half giggled once i think in the whole movie.I wouldn't bother wasting your time to see this, i even think 'A haunted house' is better than this and that is saying something.

If you like this type of movies - even if not, sometimes -, you can laugh out loud and have a good time either alone either with party. I am not saying that those films are the best way to spend your time with friends, but it could be a good - just good - choice. Definitely better than watching a horror movie like Scream, Paranormal Activity etc, in my opinion.However, in the case of Scary Movie 5, things are, unfortunately, different. What I am trying to say, is that this movie is not even amusing. Scary Movie 5 is really boring. The first time I tried to see the movie, I stopped watching at 30 minutes. The second time I was determined and, honestly, I tried to see the whole movie from the beginning, but it was hard. I asked myself: ""Why are you doing this to yourself? What's the purpose?"", and I stopped watching again.If you are in a good mood, and you want to see something that will help you, prefer Airplane, Naked Gun, Life of Brian or some other parodies.

It was just a spoof of Mama, which I don't even know how they got it made so fast considering Mama just came off the movies. It also spoofed Evil Dead which just started this same weekend. No matter how much you think you might like this movie, or how much you think you would like it anyway, I warn you. You WILL wish you hadn't gone. I guarantee this movie will not be showing in two weeks. It had to be a fairly decent budget because the production values were pretty decent, but I just don't see how this movie ever got approved to be made. The casting was horrible.

This movie is not funny. There you go - it fails as a comedy. In addition to that, it's dumb, mean-spirited, and in poor taste, and I think you're going to agree with me about that even if you like stuff that is in poor taste. I mean, this is basically an exploitation film for weed- and gangsta rap-obsessed 13-year-olds. It covers all the bases: sex scene involving clowns and ponies, sex scene involving pool cleaning machines, dildo collections being found by small children, things getting stuck up dogs' anuses, a scene featuring Snoop Dogg (or Snoop Lion or whatever he insists that people call him now) and a giant blunt, etc. Wow, this is multiplex entertainment in 2013?I saw the first Scary Movie and thought it was pretty amusing in places. I'm also a huge fan of totally absurd slapstick comedies like Airplane and the Naked Gun movies. What is it exactly that makes this film so awful where the others, at least on some level, succeeded? I can't think of any way to explain it except this: watching Scary MoVie is the film equivalent of eating White Castle sliders for an hour and a half, washing them down with a gallon of Mountain Dew, topping it all off with seven pounds of cheesecake and then doing the Mentos and Coke thing (featured in this film, incidentally) so you can projectile-puke the stuff you just ate all over your friends who were expecting it and think it's funny. Truly, honestly, that's the caliber of stuff you're going to subject yourself to for 90 minutes if you insist on watching this.The movie tries to make fun of Inception, Black Sawn, Evil Dead, etc., but it seems to me that you have to actually be smarter than something if you want to effectively make fun of it. Instead, they should make a movie that makes fun of all the Scary Movie movies. Honestly, they should be pretty easy targets. This movie does not have the minimum level of intelligence required to comment about anything at all. The best it can do is make ""peehole"" jokes and try to get the audience to laugh at monkeys flinging poo at the wall. No, it's really not funny.I'm racking my brains trying to recall if there was anything at all good about this film. I do remember laughing at a couple of the gags. That sex scene with clowns and ponies was actually somewhat amusing - there, I said it. I'm afraid this review is going to come off the wrong way because it sounds like I refuse to watch stuff that pushes boundaries of good taste. Hardly, man. I even liked Videodrome, which Roger Ebert called ""nauseating."" The real problem is that this film uses boundary-pushing as an excuse to be stupid. In reality, it's about as intelligent as a stoned middle school dropout, incidentally the only type of person I can imagine enjoying this.I was about to start getting depressed about the state of the world given that this kind of obvious dog dookie is considered entertainment, but it doesn't seem that other people found it all that entertaining either. I watched at least two couples walk out of the theater before the end of the film, so ultimately I'm concluding that there's probably some reason to have hope about the future of this planet. Thanks, Scary MoVie! Not that there's anything to be thankful for except that no one actually came up to me and hit me in the head with a shovel while the film was playing.

Starring Ashley Tisdale and Charlie Sheen (who is only present within the first painful five minutes in a non funny sketch with Lindsay Lohan) the film spoofs big hitters such as Mama, Evil Dead and mostly Paranormal Activity, as well as non horror films Inception and Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which believe you me, comes across as an even more boring watch than the actual horror spoofs. The film drags from one loose plot line to the next, and literally rams down unfunny toilet humor gags down our throats in the hope that we find them the least bit humorous or clever. Scary Movie 5 possess no humor whatsoever, and let's be honest, does it really come as a shock? The not so painful truth is behind this movie is, every gag resolves into a heavy sigh and the rolling of eyes. The thing is with Scary Movie 5 is that it is rated as 15 like its predecessors, but the truth of it all is that the film really is aimed at anyone under the age of 5. The funniest part about Scary Movie 5 is that the target audience is not even old enough to watch it, and by the time they are, the film will be forgotten. I wouldn't even give it that long.

One of the things that really annoyed me was the voice editing as it was easy to see where they changed it. The film had some good ideas, like the ""Black Swan"" and ""Evil Dead"" but were poorly excited. The only character in the film I actually enjoyed seeing was the Spanish Maid. The rest were unmemorable and a poor choice. Simon Rex ruined this movie. I also loved how at the bottom of the screen (only when it is meant to be shot by video camera), they is the REC or the time, even when they are looking at different angles when there should be no camera there. Main example being when Rex is putting up cameras and he keeps harming himself and we see everything from direction but there are no cameras to be seen. Even when he is supposed to be screwing in a camera in his hand to the wall, we see everything for a cameras point of view from where he is going to put it.

It had it's moments, but other than that it was just a ho-hum type movie. Didn't have the engaging action and comedy that you're used to from the previous films, and just didn't really do anything for me. I like Charlie Sheen as an actor, and he's can play some funny parts, and this was no exception, but then it kind of dwindled after that. I think it's because the previous cast were not there.

In all honesty, the CIA should probably adopt this film as a method of torture in Guantanamo. The opening scene was probably the most humorous part of the film, even that was only a mild chuckle. The rest of the film was filled with random rubbish that no one in the cinema found amusing. Through out the whole film I only heard one laugh, and even that was from some women sat in front of me whose husband had just asked her what the hell they were watching. If you're considering watching this film, please don't waste your time. Watching this film will make you realize how precious your time is. You could tell that the rest of the audience was thinking this as well, simply from the way everyone more or less leaped out of their seats as soon as the ending credits appeared on the screen.

You know why I say that, is because she wasn't in Scary Movie 5. She was smart. I'm not sure exactly what went wrong with this one, but I enjoyed the last 4 a lot more. Given that the 4th one was reaching a new level of stupidity, it was still 10x more funnier than the 5th. I regret paying $10 to watch this. This is the 2nd time in two weeks that I have made the mistake to pay money to see a stupid movie that ended up making me completely question why I go to the movies. Hollywood needs to wake up. Just because you can charge people money to see a movie, doesn't mean you should. Certain movies do not belong at the movie theater, and this one should have been on that list. The director should have never let this movie leave their studio, and for the sake of all of the actors, someone there should have stopped this movie from being produced. Again - I enjoyed the first 4, but I am now done with the Scary Movie saga. Enough is enough, this is just insulting. You can easily tell that even the highest paid actors like Charlie Sheen and that chick from Modern Family, put on a massive layer of suck in their roles. Are we all getting that lazy now days that we are going to record ourselves doing a horrible job, posting it to the world, and expecting money to come rolling in? I think the writers of Scary Movie should delete this one, and make a new Scary Movie 5. The next one that comes out will only be watched on DVD.",Scary Movie V

People can steal ideas from the wayans, but no one comes close with the delivery of satire except the greats.

The other successive scenes which over-employed children made the movie even provocatively and non-amusingly shocking. Lots of scenes appeared to have the aim of stereotyping, to give few examples, the Latino housemaid metonymically indicated that Latinos foolishly and frequently appeal to God to rid them of superstitious-based troubles caused by their own clumsy nature. Blacks (Snoopy Dog) a drug addict outlaw, (Tyson) was even more foolish, the psychic was a dodger, thieve, and con, in addition to the black ballet dancer who couldn't even fit into the romantic art; though she was good in lascivious pole dancing.

Whoever doesn't get that should never watch it, but don't trash talk a movie just because it does not appeal to your taste. It does feel choppy, but so did the other 4, which all have random scenes that don't have anything to do with the plot (such as the ""wazzup"" scene in the first or the basketball scene in the second). Overall, most of the spoofs were done well, even though the younger crowd won't get a lot of the ones from more ""grown up"" material such as 50 shades, Inception and Black Swan, which are dated and would have been funnier two years ago when those movies were still fresh. Despite what's wrong, I rated it a 10 because it did exactly what I wanted it to do, make me laugh. It is a great addition to the series, and the new cast does their best, although they are weak in comparison to the original stars of the series. The biggest mistake was having Simon Rex play a different character. He could have definitely been George again, because it's not like we aren't used to characters dying and coming back. The filmmakers probably watched A Haunted House and realized that they had to do re-shoots, which was a great decision. There are similar jokes, but they are definitely different in terms of humor and content. As usual, this film has had quite a large lack of promotion, just like Scream 4 and Spy Kids 4, which i'm sure has led to it's sad box office results. Movies like Date Movie, Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans were all huge hits and proved that the opinions of critics do not matter, and once people actually watch the movie instead of bad mouthing it, they'll realize that it is hilarious for what it is. I hope that there is an alternate cut on DVD. I would love to see how it was before the re-shoots, which were obviously done to make it stand out from a Haunted House, an under-rated spoof which in my eyes is the real Scary Movie 5. the actual SM5 is a good try and I would love to see another, even though this will probably be the last.",Scary Movie V

Scary Movie 5 showed a lack of intelligence, that was seen in the first two, and meant for a great lack of enjoyment for the whole film with unfunny and unoriginal jokes that have been poorly used many times before. At times the movie is actually quite repulsing and disturbing with a humor that only the hardest of snuff fans would understand.The humor in other parts of the film were at times worthy of a chuckle or a smile, but not the whole hearted roaring laughter that the first scary movie scavenged from me. I would not recommend this title to anyone who likes to spend their money on enjoyable movies and popcorn that isn't tossed towards the screen in a violent flurry.However, one aspect worth merit from me was the portrayal of Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen in the opening scenes as they were captured perfectly and did very well playing *themselves.*",Scary Movie V

It will just make you want to ask for your money back and ruin your evening. There were people walking out the whole movie, but I for some unknown reason decided to stay and watch the rest with my girlfriend and her brother....We all walked out angry and wanting the hour and like 10 minutes back from our life. I know I know your thinking oh maybe I'll still go, maybe this guy is wrong, but seriously...if you don't believe me about how bad it is, I'm sure there is a Cam download out by now that you can see what I'm talking about before you waste your time with this movie. Sorry for ranting I'm just extremely mad that it got to theaters the way it is...P.S.-worst sound and dialogue editing ever for those who care...completely out of sync almost the whole movie....seriously...I want to contact the sound department and figure out how they let all the non stop mistakes slip...",Scary Movie V
197,markfran6060,Worst movie ever,1,13 April 2013,"Don't bother going to see this junk. It appears to be very low budget and infantile. I have enjoyed the other Scary movies but this one has no redeeming value. My 15 year old son said it was the worst movie he has ever seen. Disjointed. People were leaving the theater before the halfway point and it is only an hour and a half. There is really not much you can say about it except to wait until it comes out on Netflix and even then it will hard to watch. Honestly I can't believe that after the movie company watched this movie they had the nerve to release it. In my opinion this would hurt your reputation as a Film maker more than helping by a long shot. There is a considerable difference in the quality of this Scary movie and the others, none of the original cast appear in the movie and it seems to be based mostly on paranormal activity, the set becomes very stagnant. My son said that the actual paranormal activity was funnier. My son loves the Scary movie brand, he said this one would give the franchise a bad name and he would give it a -2 if he could.This is a good reason to use Pirate Bay. The public is certainly being ripped off by paying for this kind of crap.Anyone who gives this movie a positive review should be suspect. They are either being paid or benefiting in some way.I like this type of movie - this one is just bad.",Scary Movie V
198,lutherdwl4,OK. It is a PARODY movie. Cut it come slack.,8,14 April 2013,"Now, before you hate me for giving it an 8, remember, its my opinion. This movie is supposed to be bad, like the toy car scene, it was terrible on purpose, and it was kind of funny. I admit, me, my sister, and pretty much every one in the theater was laughing their asses off. Because, if you take it as it is, a Parody movie, it is pretty damn funny. Don't watch this movie if you don't watch horror movies, because you wont know whats going on, and you wont understand the jokes. I am saying the best part of the movie was the parody of Paranormal activity and they made a whole party scene for the pool cleaners. That was hilarious. And when Maria and Dan were fighting in the front yard. I also appreciated the Morgan Freeman sound alike narrating the movie. But don't watch the movie hoping for there to be a plot, because their wont be one. I honestly thought the movie was hilarious. And them having to re-shoot almost the whole movie like a month before release, and it not being completely terrible, that was pretty damn good on their part. Also, these people are making a movie for our entertainment, and they spent tons of time and money on it, the least we can do is appreciate the movie for what it is. A Parody.",Scary Movie V

Don't waste your time and money. I am a large follower of the scary movie series, and Up until scary movie 4 loved every one of them, this one was a complete disaster. (Possible spoiler) Most of the lines said in the trailer (the things that are meant to make you want to watch it ) were never even in the movie. Madea gets all of 2 lines, so if that's what you were expecting to make it better, don't bother. In the trailer it says ""front door open"" about 5 times then says shower door open, then pantie drawer open, none of that was ever Said in the movie.

What makes this worse is the appalling excuse of a story line which is next to non existent. Don't get me wrong there were some amusing moments in the film which were well scripted and thought out but as for the rest of the film it appeared to be built around these moments unfortunately dwarfing them.This film was overly disappointing and unfortunately this film does not fit in with the rest of the scary movie films and is a let down to the franchise and does not do the series justice.",Scary Movie V

I don't think people are being very enthusiastic about number 5 as it lacks our favourite characters Brenda and Cindy although they are gone we can be sure that there is still some hope that we will meet them once more in the final instalment of ""Scary Movie""While on the subject of the final instalment of the franchise ""Scary Movie 6"" is rumored to be the whole revival of our classic movies bringing parodies from: The Devil Inside, Insidious, Childs Play, Dark Skies and its hard to forget The Woman In Black.Well we can only hope to see Brenda and Cindy returning to fight evil once again.",Scary Movie V

It was so kiddy in some stuff and overly done I honestly don't know what they were thinking or even if they were thinking when they did this movie, just awful. I liked more a haunted house and that is a lot to say cause it wasn't that good either but at least it made me laugh a few times, well maybe the only thing i like more than the haunted house is that they didn't go showing butts around or sexual actions every 5 seconds, I am not saying they don't, but is less than the others. I still don't recommend anyone to see it, not even in red box wait it to be on TV :)",Scary Movie V

The script seems rushed and if you have epilepsy please do not go it will cause you a seizure in the club scene (which is completely pointless). The beginning is pretty much filler just to say they have Charlie Sheen and Lyndsey Lohan in the credits (which is the only part they take in the movie (first 10mins). I promise this movie will disappoint unless you're a teen which you may find poop and fart jokes funny. I didn't go to this movie thinking it was going to be good, I actually was looking forward to the parodies which were very weak and since when is planet of the apes a scary movie?",Scary Movie V
205,alexanderbrath,Another hilarious movie from the Scary Movie team.,6,16 June 2013,"Judging from the 3.7 stars grade here on IMDb, people didn't like this movie too much. This surprised me, since my guess would be that most users, especially those that go on the page of this movie, are probably under 30. I guess these people just don't understand or get the humor.3.7 is way too low for this movie.The fifth installment of the Scary Movie series starts of with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan in bed, spoofing Paranormal Activity. After that, Scary MoVie, just like the previous movies, spoofs other movies. Movies that get spoofed are Mama, Paranormal Activity, The Cabin in the Woods, Black Swan and The Rise of the Apes.After the first scene, we get to follow Mac Miller and Snoop Dogg walking through a forest, looking for a place that grows ""the best marijuana"". They are gonna go there, and leave. They are later seen running with a huge joint, that both are carrying. They then find a cabin, and a slightly tiresome dialog breaks out between Mac and Snoop, in which Snoop doesn't know what movie Mac is talking about when they are looking at a ""Cabin in the Woods"". They enter the house, and they find two girls, like in Mama where two little kids are found in a cabin in the woods.Simon Rex and Ashley Tisdale portrays the parent characters of the horror movie Mama in Scary Movie 5. I personally am not a huge fan of Simon Rex's in this movie, as I think his humor and acting is a little bit too immature or whatever.There are also a lot of guest stars in this movie, for example Lindsay Lohan as mentioned before, along with Snoop Dogg, Mac Miller, Usher, Katt Williams, Madea, Lil Duval, Sarah Hyland, Bow Wow and more. They make the movie a lot better, as it gives the movie variation and other positive things.I can't remember the last time I laughed as much as I did during the scene where Sarah Hyland and Bow Wow along with two other actors, gets possessed (or something like that) while they are portraying the characters of the movie ""The Cabin in the Woods"", obviously in a cabin in the woods. When it all comes down, I think Scary MoVie was one of the best ones so far in the series. If you've enjoyed the previous Scary Movie titles, you will most likely love this one. It gets kind of slow at times, and I personally didn't like the gorilla scenes too much. All the funny scenes made up for that though. There is no 6.5 star grade, but that's what I give it.Thank you for reading!",Scary Movie V

I watched the trailer and I thought this was quit bad but I waited so long for new episode, so I just had to see it my own. So when I started watching the movie, my first thought was: why haven't I laughed yet? When I had watched almost entire movie..than there was thoughts like: What happened with this movie? Why the movie doesn't make any sense? I did not understand the script, is there any? This was new level on failure..It seems the actors and writers were like: Hey let's get together and make a some money for just sitting there and talking some pointless things out of our mouth and hope fot the best.

207,SBreezy29,Worst of the Scary Movies,2,27 August 2013,"Watched this past weekend, and fell asleep not even half way through! Ashley Tisdale really isn't a very good actress at all, and should stick to just TV from now on. The beginning with Charlie Sheen and Lindsey Lohan playing themselves was actually funny. They poked fun at themselves in a good way, but other supporting cast wasn't that good at all.I think after the first 2 they kind of lost their luster. Just kept getting more ridiculous. I get the point,but it relied way to much on physical humor. Simon Rex isn't that horrible of an actor, he just needs some better material. Bottom line is don't waste your time on this crap!

I knew not to expect much based on Scary Movie 4 but was hoping with the amount of hype and good trailer I could expect more. However, this feel very far from the mark, it wasn't humorous at all, I understand they go over the top, but this just looked like they were trying way to hard to be funny, with material that has been done a thousand times. I've seen better low budget parody movies in the last 6 months, that probably had about an 8th of the budget as this. The actors used were of very low talent, and you know you've done something wrong when you cannot even get the series lead star to come back for the fifth movie. Giving this an honest 1/10 because it was really that bad, extremely poor writing, extremely bad acting and just no scene where I could laugh and I laugh at everything.",Scary Movie V
209,starfishr-751-546917,A disappointment.,3,30 July 2013,"I am a huge fan of the Scary Movie series. I always liked parts 3 and 4 better than 1 and 2, but that's my opinion. And I've seen all of them at least 5 times each.What part 5 did wrong? There are a couple of things, and all of those weren't nearly as bad in the previous Scary Movies.The plot is basically non-existent. It vaguely describes the things that are happening in Mama and all the other spoofs (like the Black Swan side plot) don't feel like they are embedded into the main storyline at all.Of course the plot lines weren't the main focus of all scary movies, but this one doesn't even try. Suddenly, there's Katt Williams appearing to attempt some sort of exorcism and disappears after 3 awkward minutes, leaving nobody laughing and everyone asking what the hell that was about. At another point, the pool-cleaning robots are having a pool party. Which is a totally unfunny idea in the first place, but they just went along with it and stretch that ""joke"" to over 2 minutes, making you look at your watch or cellphone or anything else, really.The only thing that saves the movie are some really good jokes here and there. But they are very rare and really not worth to sit through this ordeal. The only thing that could have made this worse is a dancing scene (Yes, Disaster Movie and Meet The Spartans, I'm looking at you) or a Michael Jackson joke...and how useless was that 50 Shades Of Grey spoof? At least they cut ca. 80% of it out of the final movie, which becomes obvious when they show so many parts of it during the credits.",Scary Movie V

It was just horrible, I didn't laugh at all. It was worse than those cheap sex and drugs comedy movies that are a dime a dozen. I expected more from it. The mise en scene was completely different than the other Scary Movies. And it lacked the flow typically found in a Scary Movie, the flow was completely off.

Scary movie 1 actually had me rolling at times, but also had great comedic timing. This movie however, lacks EVERYTHING. I didn't laugh once, ONCE. Not ONE thing made me laugh, no nothing. The scenes that were supposed to build some suspense weren't even laughably bad. The ""scary"" scenes weren't even close to scary; sped up and the music was so unfitting.

In the movie, you could see the mask lines, you could see they were cheaply made, the mama costume was just cheap cloth and the make-up was really bad, and to finish it off: just the whole plot and charters were awful This movie cost me 2 things: 15 bucks, and 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Which FAILED in epic proportions, throughout the entire movie, i laughed a grand total of twice... and not the roll around belly ache laugh, just a minor chuckle... twice.
