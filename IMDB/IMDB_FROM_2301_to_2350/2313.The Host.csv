0,Leofwine_draca,A dysfunctional family comedy...with added river monster,9,27 April 2012,"Whilst I really enjoy monster movies – I have done ever since watching the original KING KONG as a kid, and regard the 1950s as the greatest decade for them – I think it's fair to say that they don't make many good ones these days. One of Hollywood's more recent offerings, GODZILLA, was absolutely abysmal, an example of everything that's wrong with clichéd, predictable filmmaking.What a surprise, then, to discover an extremely good monster movie coming out of South Korea, of all places. Why is THE HOST such a great movie? Because it's not a monster movie at all. Instead, it's a kind of quirky comedy/drama about an extremely eccentric and unconventional family and the relationships between the members of said family. Oh, and it just so happens that a massive, squid-like monster features in the film too.The opening of this movie is a fantastic combination of great CGI effects work and stylistic filmmaking. Out of all the monster attacks I've seen put on film, this has to stand as one of the best of all time. The rest of the movie doesn't aim to continue on the same wavelength, and nor should it have, as the viewer would have become quickly desensitised as a result. Instead the monster is rarely seen (until the climax, at least) and we follow the misadventures of various bumbling characters.There's a single, crucial question that comes to my mind when weighing up the success of THE HOST: would it work if you took the monster out? The answer is yes. The family of protagonists who focus the film are engagingly eccentric, and eccentric characters always grab the interest of audiences. There's the acerbic grandfather, the slob of a father, the outspoken daughter, the alcoholic brother and the sports star sister. The scrapes they get into are inventive and funny, and infused with plenty of tension, so that the added monster stuff becomes the icing on the cake rather than the end result. It's getting very hard to make original movies these days, but with its obtuse recipe of differing genre elements and bizarre incidents, THE HOST is exactly that.",The Host
1,SnoopyStyle,good monster movie,7,2 October 2015,"An American military doctor dumps formaldehyde down the drain. Later, a monster emerges from the Han River. Park Gang-Doo is a bumbling idiot who runs a riverside snack shack with his father Hie-Bong. He has daughter Hyun-Seo, his competitive archer sister Nam-Joo and his drunk brother Nam-Il. The monster takes Hyun-Seo back to his sewer lair where she's joined by Se-Joo. All the witnesses are forcibly quarantined by the military. Hyun-Seo manages to phone her father. The Park family escape and go on a rescue mission.I love the monster and this is a good creature feature. Kang-ho Song is a fun actor. It's got some political ax to grind. I really like the tension building up to the grandfather's death. It takes a break there before restarting. It would have been great to keep going instead of getting recaptured by the military. Overall, it's a good monster movie.",The Host
2,Hitchcoc,"Good Monster, Not Much Else",6,20 January 2010,"I was impressed with the way the monster in this film moved. The opening scenes are decent, though I think it's a bit unbelievable at times. Still, it was well set up, even with that idiot guy with the peroxide hair. From then on it reminded me of the three stooges. Does it want to be serious at all, or is it being played for slapstick. After all, there are real victims out there who need help. It's the daughter in the family for heaven's sake. I don't know much about Korean cinema. The Japanese made Godzilla into a buffoon eventually, diminishing any seriousness from the films. Maybe this is just another Asian effort at comedy, cloaked in seriousness. I never took any of those people seriously from beginning to end. When the acts of heroism occur, they can't overcome the idiocy that got them there. The final confrontation with the monster is well done but otherwise I wouldn't bother.",The Host
3,claudio_carvalho,"Good Movie, But Could Be Better",6,15 November 2007,"On 09 February 2000, the American military base of Yongson releases toxic chemicals in the drain to the Han River under the direct order of an arrogant coroner. Six years later, a mutant squid monster leaves the water and attacks people on the side of the river. The teenager Park Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko) is carried by the creature and vanishes in the river. While grieving her loss, her slow father Park Gang-du (Kang-ho Song); her grandfather and owner of a bar-kiosk nearby the river Park Hie-bong (Hie-bong Byeon); her aunt and archery medalist Park Nam-Joo (Du-na Bae); and her graduated unemployed uncle Park Nam-il (Hae-il Park) are sent by the army with all the people that had some sort of contact with the monster to quarantine in a facility. During the night, Gang-du receives a phone call from Hyun-seo telling that she is alive in a big sewage nearby the river. Gang-du tell the militaries but nobody believes on his words, saying that he is delusional due to the shock of his loss. The Park family joins forces trying to find Hyun-seo and rescue her.""Gwoemul"" recalls the movies from the 50's, or even ""National Kid"" series, with panic and screams and good special effects. The plot is actually a dark comedy with many jokes and irony against the external politics and lack of respect for the environment of the American government, blended with sci-fi, horror, drama, thriller, adventure and action. Unfortunately director and writer Joon-ho Bong uses ""heavy hands"" and unnecessarily sacrifices Park Hyun-seo in the end without any reason, considering the confused genre of the film. The film uses many clichés and one last saving the teenager would not spoil the conclusion of the story. In the end, my delight turned into disappointment and I found"" Gwoemul"" too dark, dramatic and tragic for a comedy, sci-fi or adventure, and too silly for a horror or thriller. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Hospedeiro"" (""The Host"")",The Host
4,kosmasp,Bad Host,8,25 April 2020,"Watching this during a pandemic is especially fun. Now that is sarcasm if anyone needs to know - but current politics and bad advice aside, the movie is quite an experience. And it goes after the juggular from almost the start. Yes the US scientist is the bad guy (don't get upset, it's a movie and Americans do it too to other nationalities, so relax) and makes one very bad decision by forcing a Korean scientist to do something very bad.Which is the inciting incident. And 15 minutes into the movie we already get to see the special effects. And while I reckon today you could do some things better - it still looks amazing. Great movie overall and nice structure, even if for some it may feel too convoluted and filled with too many characters. That's a point some may take into account for. But if you don't mind and have found Korean cinema after Parasite or whatever other movie made you look there, this is a very good movie - not the only one as we know, but if you like horror/creature features this is one to watch",The Host
5,gavin6942,"Maybe Koreans Love It, But This American Is Left Wanting",6,9 August 2007,"After an American scientist commands his Korean assistant to dump formaldehyde into the Han River, a creature soon appears that is more than happy to devour screaming people in his path. Some he eats now, some he saves for later. One man decides his daughter is one of those who was not eaten, but the government wants him locked up for being a possible carrier of the new creature's alleged contagion.This film is billed as a horror comedy. The horror aspects are clear -- like Godzilla before, this is a story of a creature from the sea who just goes berserk. The difference here is that people don't love this creature like they love Godzilla, and this one is heavily computer-generated. The comedy parts... I'm not so sure. I understood what was supposed to be funny, but I can't say it really was. The only part I really laughed at was the first five minutes because it was so over-the-top regarding the chemical dump. I think much of the rest of it died in translation.The effects are good. Now, I don't like CG... and this is a very noticeable CG. But I also have to say it's better than I would expect for Korean standards. Of the few Korean films I've seen, they're not working with the best of effects or budgets and I really think they pulled through on this one. So I give them credit for that.Otherwise, this is mostly just a story of a family hiding from the government. Sometimes it's fun to watch, other times I was pretty bored. It seems to just go on at times, and I'm actually upset the daughter wasn't killed my the monster towards the beginning. This leads to some really stupid plot twists later on. The end, which as always I cannot reveal, is about as dumb as you could imagine.The acting was good, although I didn't like the main character. He was a buffoon and just looked a mess. I understand he was supposed to come across in this way, but he was just unlovable. His daughter could die, he could die, anything could happen to him and I wouldn't have cared. His sister, the archery professional, was a much better character and I would have rather followed her. Heck, a movie with an archer versus a sea creature... that has potential.I enjoyed the social commentary. The ""agent yellow"" was nice, the American scientist who pollutes Korean waters... the SARS tie-in (oh no, not a civet cat!). This was pretty much all that kept me going. I even had to take a break in the middle to watch some YouTube comedy skits. I don't have a short attention span, trust me -- I watch a lot worse than this. But it just didn't flow for me.If you're curious to see the film that set Korean box office records, check this out. If you like sea creatures like Godzilla, maybe you'll like this one. Rue Morgue did a cover story on this... as much as I love Rue Morgue, I think they picked the wrong cover. This film should have capsized on the boat ride over.",The Host
6,lee_eisenberg,"in my view, it sort of alludes to Korea's reality",7,22 October 2007,"When Joon-ho Bong's ""Gwoemul"" (called ""The Host"" in English) came out in the United States, the reviews called it terrifying and hilarious at the same time. Now that I've seen it, I'm not sure that I would call it either of those. I find its strength in its possible allusion to the state of affairs in Korea.For starters, there's the American dumping formaldehyde down the drain into the Han river. We should all know that US troops have remained stationed in South Korea ever since the Korean War ended - so to speak - in 1953. I don't know what most people there think of the US presence, although I get the feeling that they somewhat resent the US army maintaining a presence there (and to my knowledge, most South Koreans opposed the US invasion of Iraq). Therefore, I wouldn't be surprised if they portrayed the American causing the problem as an indictment of the US keeping troops in the country, especially since the scene was based on a real incident (see IMDb's trivia for this movie).And then, the monster. Is it a representation of North Korea? Of the United States? Or just a plain old monster? I suspect that in a small nation like South Korea, many people feel like pawns in the massive (monstrous?) world of geopolitics, what with the US and North Korea always on the verge of facing off. If these nuclear-armed countries set about finishing the never-truly-ended Korean War, then South Korea just might bear the brunt of everything.Of course, I might be reading too far into the movie. I gotta applaud the director for creating such an interesting monster movie, especially given how they play with the audience. The actors know just how to get the characters right in the various situations that they experience. A really fine one.",The Host
7,jboothmillard,The Host,7,5 December 2011,"I had heard the title of this South Korean film in a few places, not just in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but that was certainly a big reason I was even keener to see it, and being a fan of horror films. Basically a careless morgue has been emptying formaldehyde into the sewers near Seoul's Han River, and as a result it has created a large mutant monster with a hunger for human victims. The seemingly slow-witted Park Gang-Du (Kang-ho Song) is horrified after seeing the creature take his daughter Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-seong) near Wonhyo Bridge, but he has faith that she is still alive. The government soon get involves and try to defuse the situation, and after some research they conclude that the monster is not only dangerous for killing people, but it is also apparently the host of a deadly virus. This is of course is a big lie to keep people out of the way, Gang-du and his family start searching sewers to find the whereabouts of the missing daughter, who is there with a couple of other people the creature has dropped in to eat later. A phone call from Hyun-seo is what helps them out, they track the location of the call and are able to finally tackle the beast and get back the victims, and the government have created the Agent Yellow toxin to kill it. The toxin only works temporarily, and it brings out Hyun-seo inside its mouth, but Gang-du manages to defeat it with the help of a man's petrol and a flaming arrow fired, she thankfully is alive and the crisis is ended. Also starring Hie-bong Byeon as Park Hie-bong, Hae-il Park as Park Nam-il, Doona Bae as Park Nam-Joo, Ah-sung Ko as Park Hyun-seo, David Joseph Anselmo as Donald and Martin Lord Cayce as U.S. Senator. It is a relatively simple monster versus human story, the special effects to create the creature and the chaos it ensues are certainly inventive, and there are some exciting moments, so overall it is an enjoyable science-fiction comedy horror. Very good!",The Host
8,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of This Korean Monster Movie,3,24 August 2007,"MONSTER - He was great; I loved the special-effects which created this monster which looked like an updated version of ""The Creature From the Black Lagoon."" The scenes with this beast roaming the land and capturing people ranged from good to jaw-dropping.SOCIAL COMMENTARY: Much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as the doctors (under orders from the government) state that SARS-like disease is out there. In a nutshell, we get the familiar government cover-up story. You know, I expect this Liberal paranoid mindset with Hollywood films always painting our government as corrupt, but it looks like the Koreans are copying the format, and it's very tedious. In here, it takes away from the excitement and suspense of this ""monster."" It just drags the film down. The main family featured in the film has to watch from a distance while the young girl in their family, presumed dead, was hauled off by the creature.MORAL: A typical ""don't pollute the water"" message because this is what can happen - a horrible mutated monster. This used to be the anti-nuclear bomb message from the 1950 when radiation caused giants ants, spiders, fish or whatever in those schlocky sci-fi films. Now its ""environmental issues"" that are the focus.THE HUMOR This was mostly stupid. I normally laugh at slapstick but this wasn't funny. I don't know if the Korean sense of humor is that pitiful, or the film was purposely trying to be ultra-corny with a take on the old ""Godzilla"" movies. Let's hope it's the latter.TRANSFER - The video transfer was good. This was a sharp-looking picture and sound was decent with a lot rear-speaker crowd noise. I watched this in Korean with the English subtitles. That might have been a mistake as the Korean guttural voice sounds got annoying after a half hour.OVERALL - This had a promise but turned out to be a big letdown and even boring in too many spots, which is inexcusable for a modern-day monster film. Two hours was WAY too long for this story. How this film drew record crowds in Korea I don't know. They must not have much in the way of films to enjoy and support.",The Host
9,Tweekums,Fun Korean monster flick,8,9 September 2009,"I watched this film for the first time yesterday and really enjoyed it. As one would expect from a monster movie there are are plenty of thrills and scares, there are also quite a few surprisingly funny scenes which I liked.After chemicals are dumped down the sink and flow into Seoul's Han River a strange creature appears and runs amok amongst the crowd on the riverbank. Most of its victims are killed but one, Park Hyun-seo is taken alive to the creatures lair deep in the city's sewers. Her family, along with other survivors, have been quarantined on the grounds that they may have caught a virus after coming into contact with the creature. When they get a phone call from Hyun-seo the authorities don't believe them so they escape and search for her while being pursued by the authorities.The creature special effects were very good, it didn't look at all fake which obviously aided the films believability. We got to see the creature surprisingly early in the film, a refreshing change from the convention of only showing glimpses or parts of the monster till the final confrontation. The acting seemed pretty good although it is hard to judge fairly as I don't understand a word of Korean so had to rely on the subtitles to understand what was being said. The film has obvious political overtones but I didn't feel they were overdone and were used to advance the plot.",The Host
10,BA_Harrison,On a par with Jaws IV: The Revenge,4,10 September 2007,"When I was a teenager, my friend Gaz and I made a dreadful horror short entitled 'Creation', about a monster that is accidentally created when a mixture of chemicals are irresponsibly poured down a sink. With awful execution, lame 'effects' and, above all else, a bloody stupid idea, the result was laughable.It struck me as amusing, then, that The Host, a hugely successful South Korean monster flick, uses a similar premise to my shot-on-video crap-fest (but admittedly features an impressively rendered CGI beast rather than a badly made clay model with marbles for eyes). And it too is pretty lousy!The ridiculous opening to this Asian money-spinner sees a whole shed-load of Formaldehyde being chucked down a plug-hole by a reluctant Korean, after being ordered to do so by his uncaring American boss (subtle political commentary, NOT!). The nasty chemicals flow into Seoul's Han river, and before you can say 'mutant', a massive slimy fish-thing is gobbling up anyone unlucky enough to cross its path.When lazy food-seller Park Gang-Du sees his daughter snatched by the scaly critter, he is inconsolable; that is until he receives a call from his little girl on his cell-phone. The monster has her trapped in a sewer and it is only a matter of time before its appetite will return...What might have been an exciting race against time (to rescue the poor kid in peril) is turned into a yawn-a-minute snooze-athon by the introduction of several more members of the missing girl's family, an unnecessary subplot about a possible virus (which is passed on by the lolloping mutant), and the subsequent planned use of chemicals to deal with the problem.Rather than allowing our heroes to just get on and hunt down the beast, director Joon-ho Bong spends far too long showing us Park Gang-Du suffer at the hands of heartless scientists, his attempts at escape, and the rising tension in the city as the military prepare to use the ominous sounding 'Agent Yellow' to wipe out the supposed disease. All momentum is lost, and the film stalls, never to recover.The special effects are very well executed, but even though the ten-ton tadpole is nicely animated, it does suffer from being a rather poorly designed, and not particularly memorable, movie monster: a tentacle here, a flipper there, and some snappy jaws, but lacking the 'wow factor' necessary for inclusion in the movie monster hall of fame.Don't believe the hype: The Host really doesn't deserve the praise that has been heaped upon it. And if you must see it, be sure to seek out a subtitled version, 'cos the English dubbing on this film sucks!",The Host
11,paul_haakonsen,Incredible,9,26 January 2010,"This movie took me by storm, it is by far one of the more interesting, fast paced, seat-gripping movies to come out of Korea.When I initially picked up this movie, I was sort of sceptical, a monster movie from Korea? Going to be mediocre at best. But this is where I thought wrong...Right from the beginning, this movie was interesting, and it never lets you go once it got you. Fast pace from start till end. And it really helps that the effects are awesome.The movie mixes humour well with the ""horror"" part of it, as it is a monster movie. And it works well. Even if you are not a particular fan of Asian movies, you might want to check this out for the effects alone.I have seen this movie a couple of times already, and it doesn't get boring. It is somewhat of a gem in Asian film history - at least I think so.",The Host
12,Quinoa1984,the kind of movie the 1998 Godzilla should have- or maybe could never have- been,9,9 October 2006,"The Host by filmmaker Bong Joon-Ho is a funny, sharp monster movie the likes of which remind me of what I did NOT see in the remake of Godzilla in 1998. There they had the special effects, the huge lizard, and the all-star cast. But there was a hollowness even in the better or funnier moments. Here the filmmaker is more focused on putting just the right hint of satire and message behind material that actually works with the bigger picture. It's a story with its focus kept small, even amid the virus outbreak scares and protests by the masses (one is reminded of SARS and other disasters in Asia's recent memory, not just Korea or China). It's about a family that becomes torn through this huge fish-monster crawling out of the water and killing/taking people back to his sort of sewer-lair. The amazing thing too is how entertaining it is, and the line between comedy and tragedy, and melodrama and genuine excitement and terror, for better or worse, ends up making The Host something that should keep cult-movie fans captivated.After expository scenes showing how pouring chemicals can lead to a massive mutation mistake, we're introduced to Park Gang-du (the very talented Song Kang-Ho), who is a bit of a lazy guy running his business, not that well, though with a daughter he cares for. This all changes when the monster comes upon the scene (that being one of the very best parts of the film), and the daughter is taken away from him. He thinks he's seen the worst now, and the whole family grieves- this is another of the scenes that successfully skates against a horrible thing like losing a child and delivering it in absurd ways- only to discover, at least to Gang-du, that she lives via a call from a cell phone. The focus is now set for the rest of the film- find the sewer she's at and rescue her. If only people could calm down about this so-called virus outbreak.The scenes with the family, and all of the actors involved, are really the strongest scenes, showcasing each one's talents and strengths (the grandfather character played by Hie-bong Byeon, is one of the best). It all leads up to a powerhouse climax involving noxious chemicals, and facing down the beast for good. The weaker aspects, including an intriguing but underdeveloped bit of political and social satire involving the control and fear and such instilled in the public, are not too deterring as luck would have it. The creature is also a marvel, as something that is, of course, not looking like much of something that's real, but as a visual effect it works much, much better than in the monster movies of recent years. It's believable in the unbelievable sense, and there's even a couple of true shocks that come out from its quasi-indeterminable physical make-up. The Host is, above all else though, a B-movie, and Bong Joon-Ho knows this like it's nobody's business. This is why the film works, even when it doesn't completely, and it's always a fun ride in both the ridiculous and catastrophic, putting a good grin on my face for more than half of the picture.",The Host
13,Coventry,The Host with the MOST!,8,7 April 2007,"""The Host"" is probably the greatest Asian monster film since the original ""Godzilla"", which is over 50 years old already, and yet it doesn't even fully qualify as a monster film! If you'd ask me to compare ""The Host"" with just one film, I'm more tempted to use the recent Oscar-winning comedy/drama ""Little Miss Sunshine"", as both films primarily handle about a dysfunctional family getting closer together through a whole series of highly unlikely events. As weird as it sounds, the impressive computer-generated titular water monster is actually just a necessary supportive character in the family portrait of the Parks, who own a small snack bar at the wharf of the Han River. When a gigantic mutated creature (whose origin briefly got explained during the funny intro sequences) captivates the only daughter of natural born loser Park Gang-Du and keeps her imprisoned in the huge sewer network of Seoul, the family immediately combines forces and sets out to rescue little Hyun-Seo. Gang-Du is accompanied by his whiny old father, his drunkard brother and his sister the archery champion. It won't be an easy rescue mission, since they have absolutely no clue of the whereabouts of the monster's lair and, on top of all this, they're wanted by the South Korean government because they're believed to be infected with the creature's contagious virus. Joon-Hu Bong's ""The Host"" is a nearly brilliant homage to old-school B-movies, combined with the typically nowadays focus on human relations and emotional interactions. And last but not least, it's also an extremely funny movie, as the Parks' clumsy hunting methods and incompetent communication skills often result in sheer laughter and comical situations. The first acquaintance with the unidentifiable monster is undoubtedly the best scene in the entire film. Guileless bystanders notice a huge 'animal' hanging from a bridge by its tail and, before anyone realizes what's going on, the wild creature is on land and chases down anything that moves. The special effects are downright amazing and the Host itself certainly is the most menacing and horrific looking ""thing"" in decades! Particularly stunning is the way how the creature gymnastically loops from one side of a bridge to another, only using its super-flexible tail. Even though the characters' evolution to maturity and the politically satiric undertones are compelling and masterfully handled by director Joon-Hu Bong, the real horror fans among us will definitely enjoy the sequences with the monster in it the most. The film isn't entirely without flaws, though. With a near 120 minutes of playtime, ""The Host"" is slightly overrun and some of the overly talkative sequences could easily have been cut. Still, ""The Host"" is an incredibly smart horror/adventure film, with message and moral. And it's damn entertaining, too.",The Host
14,michaelRokeefe,Absolute terror. One hell of a monster.,8,10 August 2007,"From the Republic of South Korea, a monster movie that delivers the chills and thrills. Industrial waste dumped into the Han River spawns an obscure monster that uncurls from under a bridge for a frenetic feeding. Seoul onlookers lining the shore stand in a stupor then run in fear from the monster that is snatching and swallowing people whole. There is the sense of disaster and lurking doom. For drama, a young girl is grabbed by the monster and her family will risk their very lives to recover her. The city is all but paralyzed when the government claims the monster is the host of a deadly virus. Virus hell, this is a creature that is not particular about the menu. Great CGI monster, one of the best I have seen in a long time. This monster is not out to destroy a city or the world; just to maul, chew and swallow anyone in the way.",The Host
15,Scarecrow-88,The Host,9,30 June 2007,"A member of the US military orders his Korean counterpart to unload lots of formaldehyde(bottles upon bottles)into the Han River of Seoul with a type of enormous mutated marine life form emerging as a result. In the opening of this film, a mass of people at the banks of the Han River are attacked by the monster as it rampages. Hyun-seo(Ah-sung Ko)is abducted by the monster and taken to a pit inside a certain sewer system with her father Gang-Du(Kang-ho Song)""infected"" with the monster's blood supposedly when it is cut during the attack on an American. That American contracted some sort of virus which sends the government into an uproar with Gang-Du and his family quarantined. When Gang-Du receives a cell-phone call from his daughter, he'll try to break free with his family to find her wherever she may possibly be. We watch as poor Hyun-seo struggles to come up with a plan of escape as another little boy is dropped into the pit with her..the monster begins dumping bodies there while also using it as a hideaway and sleeping spot.With the government and medical personnel all over the place(not to mention police looking for them)Gang-Du and his family will search endlessly for their beloved Hyun-seo. When Gang-Du is recaptured after a tragedy towards his father, we also see a very destructive paranoia towards a supposed virus develop. An American doctor orders a Korean medical staff to ""disect out"" the virus from Gang-Du's brain when it seems that they can not find any location of a virus present in anyone near the monster's initial opening attack. If Gang-Du will ever survive, he'll have to flee again..and the idea that his daughter is still out there has not left his thoughts despite being cut into once.Now THIS is a monster movie..a scary creation that director Joon-ho Bong is not afraid to unleash on viewers countlessly. There are some great sequences where it chases various people while the city of Seoul is thrown in a state of turmoil. This flick is very reminiscent of ""Gojira"" and being based on an actual event regarding the dumping of dangerous chemicals into the Han River only heightens the drama. Also, a great film about the power and dynamic of family and what lengths they'll go to rescue one of their own.",The Host
16,CinemaSerf,An intense and thrilling roller-coaster ride...,7,27 February 2020,"Twenty-odd years ago some cavalier American scientist instructs a Korean minion to dump loads of Formaldehyde down the sink (and, thereby, straight into the Han river). A few years later a deadly monster leaves the river causing havoc and ostensibly spreading a lethal virus throughout the city. The Park family, a disparate group who run a riverside snack bar and who barely survive day-to-day life in Seoul are caught up in this as one of them is taken by the beast and the family determine to find her in the labyrinthine sewers. There are loads of twists and turns, some quite funny moments and the movie features some really good performances under Bong Joon Ho's inspired direction. The monster effects are not so rubbery (though not exactly Jurassic Park) and the music helps create and sustain a good degree of tension as the family face disasters and triumphs as they search - trying to avoid the authorities and the fearsome animal in equal measure. Given the subject matter, there is probably no better time to watch this - portentous of the risks of environmental recklessness and of our sophisticated society's inability to deal with mass-scale incidents (real or not!).",The Host
17,poolandrews,Uneven Korean monster flick.,5,26 November 2009,"Gwoemul is set in Seoul in Korea where Park Gang-Du (Kang ho-Song) works in a food stall on the edge of the River Han, one day while taking a ten legged squid to a customer a huge mutant creature emerges from the river & goes on a rampage killing several people & running off with several more amongst them Gang-Du's daughter Park Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko). The Government sends in quarantine teams to hunt & kill the creature while the survivors of the attack are sent to hospital as they may be infected with some sort of virus caught from coming into contact with the creature which is hiding in the sewers & snatching unsuspecting people. Where did the creature come from? Can a cure for the virus be found? Why is the creature taking & storing people? Can Gang-Du find & save his daughter?This South Korean monster film was co-written & directed by Joon-ho Bong & isn't a bad film but I must say I didn't the silly slapstick comedy sat that well with the more serious monster film moments although it's still a lot better than most of the 'Creature Feature' stuff that the Sci-Fi Channel air. The first thirty odd minutes are pretty terrific with the monster rampaging through Seoul, knocking people out of the way, causing all sorts of mayhem & running off with Gang-Du's daughter but then there just isn't anything else in the film that even comes close to approaching that coolness. There's something about a virus that goes nowhere & feels like an afterthought, there's an attempt at showcasing some strong family bonding in adversity & I don't quite understand what the authorities are doing to try & find this creature, I mean it's big enough & if Gang-Du & his idiot family can track it down why can't the Korean authorities? It's never clear why the creature is stockpiling humans & it doesn't seem to have any sort of plan other than snatch people from the street. The slapstick comedy elements with various people falling over & other's making silly gestures & noises seemingly at random just didn't sit that well with me against the more serious monster film moments & what Gwoemul boils down to for me is that I enjoyed it when the monster is on screen but when it's not I didn't. Also at almost two hours long it does outstay it's welcome & I am sure a good ten or fifteen minutes could have been cut & not made a whole load of difference other than speed the pace up a bit which in my opinion would have been a good thing.The actual CGI computer effects on the monster are pretty impressive & it looks great & there are some cool shots of it throughout including it swinging across bridge supports. There's no major gore or violence here. A second hand shop near where I live has had a used copy of Gwoemul on Blu-ray for months & nobody seems to want to buy it despite it being the lowest priced disc in the place & after having seen it for free on telly I can understand why there's no takers. There's not that much horror here & like a lot of monster films you end up feeling sorry for the monster as irritating human beings hunt it down & brutally kill it. There's a strange moment near the beginning where Gang-Du picks up a signpost that has a picture of a trumpet with a red line across it! Are people playing trumpets in public in Seoul so common that they need signs that forbid it?With a supposed budget of about $11,000,000 Gwoemul was (& maybe still is?) the highest grossing film in South Korea with the equivalent of over 20% of the population having seen it at the cinema. Having seen the subtitled version it's hard to call the acting but most of the leads are annoying.Gwoemul is a pretty good monster film with great CGI computer effects when the actual monster is on screen which isn't often enough because when it's not on screen my interest levels dipped dramatically.",The Host
18,dbborroughs,Genuinely scary and funny monster on the loose film has way more on its mind and ends up as one the richest and best films of the year,10,9 October 2006,"Even if I tell you its not what you're expecting its still not going to be what you expect.This is the story of a mutated fish in the Han River. Growing to the size of a locomotive and able to walk on land this is a bad fish. Reeking havoc from its first appearance it causes total chaos for the military and civilian authorities. The focus of the film is the Park family who sell snacks from a shack near the river. When the Monster strikes the youngest member of the family is carried off and believed dead. The rest of the family is thrown into quarantine with everyone else who was in the area. Somehow the young girl survived the attack and manages to call her dad with a cellphone. The authorities don't believe him and he, along with his family is forced to take action to rescue their youngest member.This film is a masterpiece. Its probably on of the best monster movies ever made. Certainly its one of the top three giant monster movies. Its not a straight horror film. Its much more than that, its a family drama, a hysterical comedy, a political thriller and yes a scary scary movie. The tension is incredible at times simply because director Joon-ho Bong, of the excellent Memories of Murder, has crafted a film where anything can happen at any time. You are never safe, with the monster showing up often when you least expect it, often after a belly laugh that catches in your throat. The film also manages to wring laughs out of incredibly tense situations as things go wrong and people make human mistakes and choices. Wow. The audience I saw this with at the New York Film Festival was both doubled up with laughter and screaming in ways that I haven't heard since Silence of the Lambs (just the screaming part for Silence).You've got to see this film, and see it more than once simply because the film defies your expectations at every turn. Its amazing. I'm sure that even if you don't like the first time- a possibility simply because it refuses to be anything other than what it wants to be- your opinion will change for the better on a second viewing as you'll be able to see it for what it is, one of the best films of its type; and one of the best films of the year.",The Host
19,Bunuel1976,"THE HOST (Joon-Ho Bong, 2006) ***",7,4 April 2007,"While the film may be yet another take on the JAWS formula, it has a very strong sense of humor which actually made it closer in effect to the likes of PIRANHA (1978), ALLIGATOR (1980) and LAKE PLACID (1998). Still, the fact that amidst all the action and special-effects stuff there is also a human story about a dysfunctional gung-ho family struck down by the tragedy makes it superior to those films; the ecological message (since the mutation is the direct result of unlawful disposal of toxic waste ordered by none other than Scott Wilson!!) is also effectively anchored among all the expert popcorn fun on display.Anyway, this is arguably the best monster movie of the decade, but I would argue (sic) that the monster is shown way too much here - so that it ceases to be really scary or even repulsive! The best sequence is certainly the very first attack on the beach, which starts out slowly but proceeds into a crescendo of chaos and destruction - though the climax (set at the exact same spot, I might add, but whose tone is entirely different) is worth waiting for. The bittersweet ending is also not what one would expect in a film of its type.The bottom line is that it is refreshing to see a modern Asian horror movie with heart - and not just a concentrated effort to drive the audience out of their wits with relentless manipulative scares...",The Host

21,grantss,Clumsily made and badly acted,5,13 June 2015,"Clumsily made and badly acted.The Host is a horror-drama about a mutant amphibious monster that suddenly emerges on the banks of the Han River in Seoul, South Korea. More particularly, it is about about how a girl is captured by the monster and how her father, with his sister, brother and father, try to find her.The movie had some potential, as its seemed more original and less predictable than your average creature-horror movie. From the beginning, however, the flaws appear. Acting is mostly woeful. The ""hero"" of the story is hardly inspiring and is farcically played. Special effects are pretty bad and look like they come from the 1970s, not 2006. The monster hardly blends seamlessly into scenes...Moreover, the plot is clumsy, as is direction. Things happen that make absolutely no sense and there are dead-end sub-plots. It's not all bad though. The action scenes are pretty good and the plot is pretty intense at times. Last few scenes are quite absorbing. There are a few funny moments, though, unfortunately, much of the attempts at humour end in farce and detract from the intensity of the movie.Ultimately it is better than your average horror movie, but that doesn't say much.",The Host
22,Boba_Fett1138,A good mixture of comedy and monster movie elements.,7,8 September 2012,"The foremost reason why this movie worked out was because it successfully managed to blend comedy with some classic monster movie ingredients. It's unfortunate that the movie is not as great as it potentially could had been but overall it's still being a pretty good watch.Some people just seem to absolutely love South-Korean movies and consider the comedies to be some of the funniest ever. Well, not me. I really do like Korean cinema but its comedy really isn't my thing. The way it comes across to me; it often wants to be witty and seen as clever social satire but they do this by often inserting forced and over-the-top comedy, that also too often comes across as lame to me. I have still yet to see a South-Korean movie that truly makes me laugh out loud.Still the comedy also remains one of the movie its greatest strength, as strange as that may sound. It helps to keep the movie light to watch, which causes you to never look at this movie as a serious monster movie and this also tends to make you more forgiving toward the movie. Since after all, the movie and its story are in essence very formulaic ones, in which only small details and little touches help to make this movie distinct itself from other, similar, genre movies.You could definitely watch this movie as a social satire and I did get all of that but I just don't feel it was a very strong one as such. It's just referencing stuff but it doesn't make a good point about it or tries to make a statement with this movie. It's not really a movie that makes you think- or reconsider things, so to speak.I was also really missing something in this movie, which was hard to put my finger on. I guess that it was action and entertainment. There are large portions in this movie in which its monster never appears. The movie is also lacking some good and spectacular set pieces, in which the monster gets attacked or is attacking itself. Basically there only is a 'big' action scene at the start and at the very end of the movie but I definitely wanted to see some more in the middle of the movie as well.No doubt this had everything to do with budgeting reasons though. Of course this is not the most expensive movie ever made, which unfortunately does show at times. I'm not just talking about the lack of action at times but also about the look of the monster. The CGI is definitely lacking in parts, which really did took me out of the movie at times. It really never looks as if it's a 'real' monster that is attacking here. He does like right and good in the scenes were he appears alone but as soon as he has to 'interact' with human characters it becomes painfully obvious how fake the effects are looking.I also did wish that the movie would had had a more likable and 'normal' main character in it. I don't know what it is with Asian cinema of this sort but they often really seem to like to turn their character into an almost mentally challenged person, who becomes the unlikely hero of the movie, by the end of it. Really, no normally functioning person is as stupid and socially backward as the main character in this movie. Guess that's what Asian people like to see; watch the underdog rise and become the one to save the day. I'm not Asian though and I definitely prefer to see a more 'normal' person as the movie its main character and hero.Sudennly I'm starting to sound all negative about this movie but that's just because I did have some problems with the movie and most definitely was not as in love with it as some people still seem to be. I'm not saying this is a bad movie and I definitely did still liked this movie more than I didn't but I don't think it's one I'm ever likely to watch again. There just isn't enough in this movie for me, though it obviously tries very hard.It's still a nice blend of comedy and monster movie ingredients, which does indeed makes this movie perfectly watchable.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Host

In fact, until I saw ""Parasite"" it was the best Korean movie I'd ever seen and it still is.""The Host"" is about a sea creature that presumably had mutated from chemicals dumped into the Han River. It snatched a little girl named Hyun-Seo (Ko Asung) who had the misfortune of being the daughter of perennial screw up Gang-Doo (Kang-ho Song). Her family assumed she was dead until her dad received a call from her. Her cellular phone had just enough battery and signal strength to call her father from some deep, dank, concrete pit under a bridge. Her voice was faint and the call was short, but at least her family now knew she was alive. With his sister Nam-Joo (Bae Doona), brother Nam-il (Park Hae-il), and father Hie-bong (Byun Hee-Bong), Gang-Doo would then go on a mission to find his daughter.""The Host"" was a spectacular movie. Director Bong Joon Ho was completely in tune with this movie and how best to bring it to life. The visual effects were on par with any big budget film, the overall visual quality was unassailable, and the sound editing was pitch perfect. There was silence when called for, cacophony when needed, and even muted noise when it made the most sense. The characters too were such a joy. The entire Park family were a quirky and humorous bunch making them fun to watch. And the pacing and plot were remarkable. I can't say there was anything I disliked about ""The Host.""",The Host

25,evanston_dad,A Mutant Movie About a Mutant Fish,8,17 January 2008,"The monster movie is reborn in this quick, witty and endlessly creative Korean film. An opening scene showing a worker in some military lab dumping bottle after bottle of old formaldehyde down the sink sets the stage for a mutant to come slithering out of the watery depths of Korea's main river, and it does just that, looking like a big angry fish with legs. In a dazzling action scene, it wreaks havoc on pleasure seekers strolling about the waterside, and takes with it a young girl whose family spends the rest of the film looking for her. The movie is as much about the coming together of this likable clan as it is the monster, and it's peppered with unexpected moments of comedy (some of it downright slapstick), so that the whole thing feels like a hybrid of horror movie, family drama and Keystone Kops. In this way, the movie itself is a bit of a mutant.As any self-respecting monster movie should, this film feeds off of current event hot topics -- like pollution and viral pandemics -- to fuel its atmosphere of paranoia and panic (shots of Korean commuters walking the streets with surgical masks over their faces recall news images of Asia's SARS scare). There's also some quite pointed and very harsh jabs taken at America and its reputation as a country that pushes its way into other countries only to make things worse than they were before. It sickens me that other countries think of us this way, even if I can't blame them.I liked this movie's score too (it sounds like something out of an Italian mafia family movie) which again is completely incongruous with the film's other elements but yet somehow works.Grade: A",The Host
26,ferguson-6,Fish Tails,6,17 March 2007,"Greetings again from the darkness. In a tip of the cap to the old Japanese monster movies (""Godzilla"", etc), famed Korean director Joon-ho Bong delivers a surprisingly high quality film with depth and wonderful photography. Thanks to a very poor decision to dump biohazardous chemicals into the Han River, we are treated to a genetic mutation that is part Loch Ness Monster, part T-Rex and part unknown amphibian ... although not the Amazonian River Dolphin! The freaky fish has Olympic gymnast skills and shows off a killer back flip into the river. Possessing some moves similar to Godzilla, our creature actually swallows people and regurgitates the bodies into a holding area located within the sewer. The depth of the story comes from the very well written interaction within our protagonist family. This family goes through some very unusual challenges in their pursuit of the creature and the captured little girl. Along the way, the government, the military and the medical professions are all targets of the filmmakers disgust. Three downsides to the film are the way the only two western doctors are portrayed ... shame on Scott Wilson for even taking the role. Also, the finale in how the monster is dealt with is very uncreative. Lastly, the sound quality of the film is definitely not up to 21st century levels. Film goers are spoiled and expect the sound to play an important part of the experience. Here the sound is detrimental to the film. Still, definitely worth seeing as a quality monster film with depth and humor. Some of the scenes are remarkably well directed and filmed ...obviously well planned and no short cuts are obvious.",The Host

28,Aaron1375,"Not on par with ""Jaws"", still an okay monster movie.",6,1 August 2007,"I know I will be lambasted by those who love this movie and those who hate it for saying it was just okay to me, but that is how it is at IMDb. The movie sort of worked, but then it didn't. A movie where there is a mysterious creature hanging on a bridge, that promptly turns to chaos as said monster attacks. A little girl is taken by the beastie, people are quarantined, and the family of the little girl convinced she is still alive escape the hospital and try to find her. The first bit of this film was great, and I thought the hype on the film would be justified. However, after awhile the focus of the movie shifts a bit much here and there, and the plot has some problems as well. I did not care much for the ending either, however it was a surprise so in a way it was an effective ending. The monster was rather good looking in some scenes, not all that great in others, always a step ahead of a Sci-Fi channel monster movie. The strange shifts in the tone of the movie kind of had me confused at times because we went from horror to comedy to drama and here and there and back again. This did keep the movie interesting, as did the virus plot, that also detracted from the movie in that it almost was pointless in a way. Like I said this movie probably suffers from going in way to many directions and it never feels like a complete movie, however it still entertained me enough that it was an okay movie and I would recommend it to others as there are many people who really consider it an excellent flick...just a matter of taste.",The Host
29,The_Void,The best monster movie in years!,9,24 January 2008,"I have to admit that I was sceptical of the first reviews I read regarding 'The Host'. I'm not a fan of the majority of the modern day Asian horror output due to dull, yet immensely popular, films such as The Ring, Dark Water and The Grudge. The Host, however, is a film that truly deserves the praise lauded upon it. While the premise is not all that original (mutated monsters from all different countries have been terrorising our screens for decades); the style and execution of it is; and that is what makes the film brilliant. Not only is the direction stunning, the film beautiful and the central monster well designed; the way that Joon-ho Bong goes about telling this story is what really sets the film apart. On the surface, The Host is the story of a mutated squid monster that emerges from the Han River. However, beneath that it's actually the story of the Park family, who find themselves at odds with the Government after the youngest daughter is kidnapped by the monster. They're being held in quarantine, and decide to break out to track down their missing loved one...On the whole, I'm not a big fan of CGI; but I can't complain too much here. The monster is really well designed and doesn't look like any other screen monster that I've seen. The animation of it is excellent too, and the creature does almost feel like it's alive! As mentioned, the main meat of the film comes in the form of the story of the Park family who have lost their loved one. The characters are all well thought out and clearly defined and director Joon-ho Bong does an excellent job of ensuring that we care about them and about the central story. The monster appears several times throughout the film, though it's neither under or over used and the story of the family is at least as interesting as the monster itself. There's also a deeper point on display, although it doesn't have quite as much meat as was maybe intended. The two messages I could pick out were a warning message against pollution (the monster was created by chemicals being dumped in the river) and another about Government control. The central scene is the one that sees the monster first appear from the river and The Host never really tops that sequence; but regardless of that this is the best monster movie I've seen in years and not even the downer ending could wipe a smile off my face when it finished. Don't miss this one!",The Host
30,zetes,"Should have cut back on the non-monster stuff, but otherwise excellent",9,26 March 2007,"It's been a long time since they made a really good monster movie, one that's lean and fun and scary. Maybe it's just because I saw it for the first time in a while last week (and on the big screen no less), but Spielberg's Jaws strikes me as just about the perfect film of that sort. Much of The Host seems like it could come pretty close to Jaws. Unfortunately, while it is fun and scary, it can't in any way be called lean. When The Host is focusing on the monster, or the people hunting the monster, it's just plain awesome. The monster is original, cool-looking, scary, and it acts like an animal. Bong Joon-Ho's direction in these sequences is very close to being as good as Spielberg's. The one big complaint I would have with the monster is that there is little suspense built up to the revelation  there's a backstory (that frankly should have been scrapped, for both time and utter stupidity, not to mention pointless anti-Americanism  even if it is arguably a joke), but only a couple of minutes into the main story it appears and starts wreaking havoc. But, my lord, that scene where the monster is running up and down the park chasing people is one of the all-time great sequences of horror. It made me giddy, while I gritted my teeth at the same time. The big problem with the film is that, whenever it wanders away from the monster, it gets fairly weak. I liked some of the quirky family comedy (the plot is basically as follows: a father is after his daughter, who was eaten by the beast but later regurgitated alive; with him are his own father, his brother and his sister, but they are hunted by the government who thinks they're diseased), but there are too many scenes where the four adult family members are standing around shouting at each other or at the bureaucratic doctors who keep them imprisoned. It gets incredibly obnoxious at times. In short, it's reminiscent of Little Miss Sunshine in its worst moments (they even ride around in a van together). The worst part of the film is the whole satire / criticism of South Korean government, law-enforcement, bureaucracy, and the big-bad Americans, who are of course behind the whole thing. Much like Bong's last film, Memories of a Murder, figures of authority are nothing but idiotic goofballs who want nothing more than to screw the common man over. Where the cops in Memories of a Murder miss out on solving the case, the people whom you'd think would be trying to get the monster don't even seem to be looking for him. After all, it'd be easy to find, as the four heroes of the pic find it numerous times using very simple logic. Instead, they are more worried about quarantining everyone who came in contact with the beast the first time it appeared, without any proof, or even reason to believe they might be infected with anything. After the heroes escape from the quarantine, they have a fight with the monster, which several military guys with machine guns witness. But they only pull out their guns after the monster leaves. Maybe Bong was hinting at some Alien-like plot line, but he never attempts to give us any idea what anybody is thinking about the situation outside the family members. Another sequence has the younger brother escape from about fifty cops after they get locked behind a glass door and some huge glass widows, which any of them could have kicked through. There's also this whole thing with ""Agent Yellow"", a noxious gas that's supposed to kill the virus or something, and people are protesting it, but Bong never lets the audience into what that's all about. I say, if you're going to keep us in the dark, just drop it all together. There's just so much Bong could have cut back on. I realize he wanted to make it more than just a monster movie, but unfortunately he isn't nearly as talented in other departments as he is in that one. Whatever my complaints, though, I did enjoy the film and it's easily the best 2007 release I've seen so far.P.S. I hadn't had a chance to read up on the film before I wrote this review, so I completely missed that the prologue was based on a true story. Read the IMDb trivia section for further details. Of course that means I am wrong in some of my sentiments above, but I'll let my review stand as my initial reaction.",The Host

I really was looking out for it but for me it failed. It failed for me on so many reasons. It never was scary, it was almost bloodless and it's more about the family who are searching their daughter then about the monster.There's a message in it about pollution but there's also a bit of humour in it like for example the fact that they throw a can of beer towards the monster, towards the end he vomits the can. There are other funny moments too but as I said, this just didn't deliver to me what i was expecting from an Asian creature feature.It's more a kidnap story than a monster story. The daughter is being kidnapped by the creature, she's his host which explains the title and her family wants her back. The monster itself is full CGI and sometimes it isn't that good, other times it's excellent. I think I must have missed something due the high praise for The Host.

32,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Host,10,6 September 2006,"This movie has already been much hyped because everyone is wondering what the Koreans saw in it to make it a resounding box office smash. So does it live up to expectations? Yes, in a different way. What I'll include below will be suitable more for a post viewing read, although most will probably have some prior knowledge about the movie from its trailers and poster. If you don't mind mild spoilers, you can proceed, until the part where I'll warn you about something major.Watching this film will make you laugh at its comedic moments, feel a tinge of sadness in others and it might make you cry, or pound your heart with suspense, and will even satisfy the action movie lovers with some sequences. It's like a big pot of rojak - different ingredients mashed together, blended perfectly into a 2 hour long journey of pure entertainment with serious messages.At the heart of it is a tale about family. Here, given its genre, there's no all-empowered super being or man's man who goes on a one man crusade against the beast. It's about what an ordinary family doing the extraordinary by digging deep and finding strength from within. The portrayal by the lead actors are quite believable, as you feel their pain, frustrations and idiosyncrasies as they go about trying to achieve their mission despite the odds. One thing's for sure, family ties run deep, with emphasis on unity, not individuality.There're some key observations made about the human condition, how naturally curious we are when we spot things not normally seen, instinctively whipping out cameras to take pictures, and how we innocently provoke without realizing. Not too subtle jibes are made at how bumbling authorities are, and on the pompousness of the US forces in assuming control over the situation, sidestepping what they probably know as the real cause with a presentation of a smokescreen.**Here's where the major spoilers begin**The monster!! I absolutely have to blabber about it! I was half expecting Godzilla pounding through the streets of Seoul and pulverizing buildings to a pulp. But wait! The Host came up with something pretty refreshing - this monster, is midget! (if compared to conventional notions of what a monster would be). Herein lies one of the breakdowns in genre, but tenacity and nastiness is not measured on size alone - it's menacing and merciless when the time calls for it.The creation of the monster came from a fictionalized imagining of a real life scenario gone wrong, with regards to the lack of respect to the environment, and on toxic pollution. If Godzilla was created in the nuclear age to highlight its dangers, then this being was created because of mankind's preference for the easy way out - through the kitchen sink.The bugger looked beautifully ugly, but thanks to its excellent special effects teams (one of which is WETA, yeah, THAT WETA), it moves with slick grace and agility, I would even say it swaggers stylishly, It is so realistic, that never for a moment you'll think you're watching a cheesy monster flick (even though rubber suits are nostalgic).** Major spoilers end **The music is yet another plus point as it brought out the mood and plays with your emotions as well. The sound department has its work cut out in designing a unique roar, and you'll feel terrorized as if you're there on location as the creature rampages. For good measure, you might want to stay until the end of the credits for a little easter egg, and especially if you're watching it in a hall outfitted with a decent surround sound system.All in all, two words: Highly recommended. Goes into my shortlist of movie of the year too!P.S. I don't know why, but I was swearing at some parts of the movie (eg. ""******** RUN!!"") together with another group of strangers. We were having a hellishly good, fun time during the screening. Awesome!",The Host
33,christopher-underwood,exciting moments,7,22 October 2009,"A really decent monster flick with a really good monster. I loved the way it seemed made up of multiple creatures and flopped about awkwardly at times. Pretty ferocious and direct at others I must say. Very well shot and with most exciting moments as people are scooped up and saved for later. It is, however, just a little too long. It's a fairly simple story and it is, for me, padded out with unwanted family background. I understand family matters are particularly important to the Koreans and obviously they have had a pretty wretched recent history. Nevertheless some of this back and forth and doubts as to maternity slow things down. Full marks for the actress who plays the young girl, in captivity for most of the film. Not a wasted frame there, she looks good and is most expressive. If only the rest of the family had been played more this way we could all have enjoyed this monster movie more.",The Host
34,siderite,Great fun movie,8,2 April 2007,"People used with the American filmography normally see either clichéd movies or films that parody the clichéd movies, thus becoming themselves predictable and uninteresting. Gwoemul rises above this, combining humor and horror and unexpectedness into one of the most relaxing and fun films I've seen in quite a while.There is a political message in this, too. In Gwoemul Korea appears (still) like an American colony. The monster is created accidentally by an American doctor, the whole hysteria is powered by the American announcement that there is deadly virus spread by the monster, while the entire Korean armed and police force looks like little more than obedient slaves. At the end the Americans use Agent Yellow, a useless gas that reminds us of Agent Orange and, perhaps, the 2006 Chinese documentary about the American mis-treatment of American-Chinese scientists.There are countless references to other movies, but in a really subtle way.This is like someone mixed Godzilla with Feast, then introduced subtle (let me emphasize this: SUBTLE) satire. A quick example: something is moving, but they don't quite see where and what. At one moment the girl looks frightened up. A guy fires a gun upwards, like he would have expected the monster to fall from there. But there was nothing there.The characters play very well, the monster is very nicely done (if you like gigantic tadpoles with acrobatic tendencies), and people die and live more according to the laws of chance, not of popular desire.Bottom line: you just have to see this. Even my wife (a traditional hater of all things Korean, Danish, horror and parody) noticed how well the actors played.",The Host
35,Buddy-51,a cult film in the making,7,16 September 2007,"Reportedly the biggest box office hit in South Korean movie history, ""The Host"" is a fun monster-movie parody that is also a touching family drama and an indictment of the evils of modern science at one and the same time.The trouble begins when a U.S. Army mortician orders his reluctant lab assistant to pour mass quantities of spoiled formaldehyde down the drain directly into Seoul's Han River. In no time flat, the toxic waste has mutated into a massive sea creature that can live both on land and in water and which devours any hapless human unfortunate enough to wander onto its path. It also captures certain individuals and drags them to a sewer where he keeps them for later feeding. One such victim is a young girl named Hyun-seo, whose family members - a kindly grandfather, an aunt and an uncle, and her own childlike father - after receiving no assistance from the governmental authorities, are forced to make a desperate attempt on their own to rescue her.Directed by ""Memories of Murder""'s Bong Joon-ho, ""The Host"" is not a laugh-a-minute parody in the scattershot mold of the ""Airplane,"" ""Naked Gun,"" ""Scary Movie"" franchises. Instead, it mocks the conventions of its genre while at the same time treating those conventions with seriousness and respect. The characters may act in ways that are silly and goofy, but the threat posed by the creature is always real, so that we laugh at the same time we are awaiting the next suspense-filled jolt to come our way.The movie, in many ways, is really more about the dynamics of this one family than it is about a city coping with a man-eating monster. Of particular interest is Hyun-seo's father, Gang-du, a kindhearted man who lives with his dad, sleeps most of the day at the store they run, and seems never to have fully grown into adulthood. His idea of good parenting skills is playing video games with his daughter while handing her a freshly opened can of beer. This puts him in direct conflict with his younger brother and sister, who continually berate Gang-du for being an irresponsible parent. It is only in the midst of an intense crisis such as the one the family is facing that Gang-du finds the fortitude, courage and maturity he needs to be a true father to his daughter.As in most films of this nature, the scientists and governmental authorities in ""The Host"" are viewed with suspicion, if not downright hostility. They spend most of their time lying to the general public in an attempt to hide their own inadequacies and incompetence. The Americans come in for a particular black eye in this film, which prompts one to wonder just how favorably the United States government is viewed by the people (or at least the filmmakers) of South Korea.The performances are good, though ""The Host"" might have been a better film with a few minutes shaved off its running time. As it is, it runs a little long for a movie of this nature, with most of the best laughs occurring in the front portion of the film. It also has a tendency to take itself just a bit too seriously in its final half hour, blunting its satiric edge somewhat as a consequence.Still, this is a clever, entertaining film with cool special effects and an appealingly self-mocking tone.",The Host
36,bensonmum2,A rousing success and a ton of fun,8,11 August 2007,"An irresponsible U.S. Army doctor has his Korean aid dump a large quantity of toxic chemicals into the sink. The chemicals drain straight into the Han River with an unexpected and disastrous result. The chemicals are responsible for the creation of a giant mutant monster with a taste for human flesh. The creature goes on a rampage and takes a girl named Hyun-seo into the river. She is presumed dead until her father receives a garbled call from Hyun-seo's cell phone. Is she really alive? Hyun-seo's family takes to the sewers in search of her.I've been a fan of Creature Features for as long as I can remember. I grew up on stuff like Godzilla, Rodan, and the other multitude of giant creatures attacking every major city on the planet. With The Host, we have a new giant creature for a new millennium. And for the most part, it's a rousing success and a ton of fun. The opening scenes are some of the best and most believable (if any of this stuff can really be called believable) giant creature on a rampage that I've ever seen. The creature design is great. It's just what I would picture from a something horribly mutated by toxic chemicals. And I can't think of many movies where CGI was used better or more appropriately. It's really quite phenomenal. Equally amazing is the mix of humor and horror present in The Host. Some scenes are creepy while others had me all but laughing out loud. And then there's the ending. I'm not going to give it away, so I'll just say that it's much more touching than I could have imagined. It all but brought a tear to my eye. Overall, The Host features quite an intelligent, well-written script and is surely one of the better movies of this type I've seen in a long time.As much as I enjoyed The Host, it's far from perfect. To begin with, I tend to agree with some of those who found the second act disappointing. It's not that the middle portion of the movie is bad or anything, it's just not the thrill-a-minute of the opening scenes. My other problem relates to the film's anti-American stance. While I would agree that the filmmakers have every right to express whatever political opinion they may have, it's a bit overdone and too obvious in my opinion.",The Host
37,Robert_duder,Just a tad over rated I think? Sure it's a throwback to classic monster films but were they good then let alone now?,6,7 August 2007,"The Host is pretty much exactly that it claims to be and exactly what you might expect from it and so many people seem to rave about it for those reasons but is any of it a good reason? The Host is not terrible but aiming to be as bad and campy as the original Godzilla films or other monster films of the 50's and 60's seems like a bad idea. I mean someone seems to have forgotten that they didn't set out to make those movies bad and usually when you have to 'try' to purposely make your film campy, corny and just bad then it's going to go in the other direction. I've even read numerous reviews that rave about the special effects of the monster and I suppose it does look impressive being the only thing in the film that isn't gray scale and boring but the monster is really not that impressive although granted it's a million times better than any of those classic monsters ever were. The film has a strong premise and a decent cast but the script is so poorly written and they seem to make a joke of a situation that really isn't ever funny. IThe campy and corny goes way overboard and loses any of the reality and the scary scenes that should be intense from a monster movie. They never once seem to try to make it serious except when you're down in the sewer with the young girl and the monster. The adults on the outside are just chaotic and...well dumb. The entire film is of course dubbed and dubbed badly which again is their attempt at nodding those old films and that's all well and good and it isn't too annoying. In fact you get pretty used to it.Kang-ho Song plays the father of a young girl. He's a bit of a slacker trying to make ends meet and turns into some sort of hero when the monster attacks. Song's performance is good but they made him so stupid that it's almost ridiculous to try and look at him as the hero. He's not a hero but instead he's dim witted and a joke. His so called 'emotion' about his daughter being taken away is inappropriately hilarious?? Only in the last half hour of the film does he become more serious and believable. Hie-bong Byeon is the grandfather who is far more of a serious character and sadly doesn't last long enough to really balance out the silliness of the lead actor. Still Byeon is quite good in his role and is believable as the head of his mis-matched family. Hae-il Park is the other brother of the family who is far more professional and well adjusted and adds that element of sincerity to the cast which is desperately needed. Still his character is over shadowed by that of Song's character. But he does a good job. Du-na Bae is the sister and really the only balance to the almost all male cast. She's very quiet and doesn't get a lot of lines but yet really turns out a strong female performance which is great. The real star and stand out performance is by the 15 year old actor Ah-sung Ko. This is her first big performance and she does an amazing job. She is the only truly serious performance in the film and she plays to no one but herself really as she is trapped alone in the sewer with the monster returning frequently. She is really the one to watch in this film because she does a really great job.I just really don't understand what director Joon-ho Bong is trying to do with this film. He could have made a serious and disturbing horror film but instead made a 'Comedy/Fantasy/Horror/Sci-Fi/Thriller' as IMDb states it is. Should those genres be combined in this fashion? It just doesn't fit together and the ending is just awful. I mean you go through this whole film rooting for the one character that is serious and intense and smart and strong and they end the film by killing them off senselessly and kind of just replacing them in the family. It's bizarre and maybe I'm missing something in Korean culture but it's just silly. The film is quite long...nearly two hours...and it's entertaining enough but it just feels like too much a stinker to ever really consider it to be a 'good' movie. It's not even the campy plot or story or performances because campy is okay but this film should not be campy or funny in any way and it is and that's unfortunate. I appear to be in the minority though thinking this one should have went in a different direction but this is my opinion and I'm sticking to it. 6/10",The Host
38,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Fake news and formaldehyde.,8,5 March 2020,"I suppose 'The Host (2006)' is difficult to describe. It's an amalgamation of a multitude of genres, after all. It's a monster movie, first and foremost, but it's also a satiric comedy, a family drama and an investigative thriller. It constantly bounces between light and dark, serious and silly, sly and straight-forward; the end result is surprisingly cohesive. It feels free of the burden of genre, focused solely on telling its tale as effectively as possible. It's genuinely funny, genuinely scary, genuinely exciting and genuinely moving. It makes a number of bold decisions with its narrative, too. The core characters all have tangible personalities and relationships, each of them 'taking control' of the story when the time is right. It's relatively unpredictable because anything seems possible. It's also expertly crafted. There are a number of sequences and, even, individual shots that are really impressive. Overall, the affair just works. It's unique, engaging and, most importantly, entertaining. Plus, it's even more relevant today than when it was first released. 8/10.",The Host
39,bowmanblue,The running fish,8,17 August 2018,"Monster movies come and go and, these days, they're all pretty much the same. The question is, 'Can a film repackage the same old story enough to make it an enjoyable experience?' I'm glad to say that, with the Korean film, 'The Host,' the answer is a firm YES.The story itself is as old as it comes - big monster/scared humans. However, this film is just too much dumb fun to be forgotten. 99% of it is subtitled (a couple of English speaking actors pop up here and there, so you'll have to be used to reading to enjoy it) and I guess it's hard for me to concentrate on actors' performances, but I think the central family who gets caught up in an attempt at fleeing/hunting one hell of a weird fish-monster-thing are believable as a family unit.For a horror film there's not that much gore (and when I say 'gore' I mean the 'red stuff'), the 'horror' comes from watching some really helpless civilians fall foul to the beastie. The special effects are just about passible. Sometimes you look at the monster and can see that it's not really there, other times it really does interact well with the environment.What really elevates 'The Host' over so many similar films are the little touches. There seem to be plenty of 'random' moments in the story which aren't really connected to the central plot. It maybe a throw-away line from a random extra who only appears in the film to say these few words. Or it may be the added character traits and backstory which have been put in to actually flesh out the characters, rather than just making them pure 'monster-fodder.' It's pretty 'self-knowing' though never really comes across as a comedy/horror, despite the antics making me smile on more than one occasion. The family's interactions which each other are just quite fun to watch as they bicker like the best of us between them.Perhaps the film isn't quite so 'random' as I thought it was. The Korean culture appears to be different enough to our Western ways of doing things to mean that occasionally I wondered whether people would really act the way the characters did, only to conclude that the reason they were behaving that way was because they simply do things differently in certain situations. Either way, the film was enormous fun and, if you're into your monster movies then it's definitely worth adding to your collection (and it is nearly two hours long, so prepare for a monster-marathon watch!).",The Host
40,dromasca,"entertaining mix of monster, horror, family movies",8,11 July 2008,"I find it a little bit difficult to analyze why I enjoyed so much 'Gwoemul'. I am no big fan of monster movies, and while I like horror films I suffered too often watching them recently because of the inflation of films in the genre, so it is very hard to satisfy me here. It is not actually on the horror side where 'Gwoemul' succeeds the best either, its limping monster surging from the water of the river is a mix of what we fear about the Loch Ness monster and a big lizard, but not really that scary. The third component of the mix is a family movie describing a quite dis-functional family at first sight whose life is badly affected by the monster abduction of the youngest girl. Yet, nothing too special here either in the story if we are to except that rules that we know from classical family movies are broken here in an atmosphere that oddly mixes melodrama and comedy, with some of the characters badly suffering and even dying on screen at untypical timing. Here lies maybe the secret of the film - it dares break the conventions, combines horror and family relations, monsters and ecological policies in a mix with no rules set in advance, and all with an apparent nuance of directness and cruel parody. The result is highly entertaining, the good professional skills the director and his team show with camera and sound help without becoming principal actors as in many monster movies. At the end 'Gwoemul' leaves a surprisingly positive impression of freshness, efficiency and good entertainment.",The Host
41,gbill-74877,Lots of dimensions to this monster movie,8,17 June 2020,"This one grabs you right out of the chute; following the dumping of noxious chemicals into the Han River, a mutant creature develops and terrorizes Seoul, snatching a young girl away from a family. From there the film wanders through myriad themes and as we search our mind for familiar reference points, we find that it's hard to put it into a simple bucket (various monster, environmental, comedy, family drama, and conspiracy films come to mind). I see it as a strength, and Bong Joon-ho continues to impress me.Aside from the drama around the monster, the film has moments sharply satirizing America, and references to wealth distribution problems and the tradition of seo-ri, the ""right of the hungry."" We see the depravity of government institutions and callous people insensitive to suffering, from the opening scene dumping toxins in the river (echoing real-life American action in 2000), to that horrifying lobotomy scene, to the indiscriminate dumping of ""agent yellow."" I confess that I didn't care for the ending sequence, which seemed like a typical (and uncreative) Hollywood ending, but overall there is a lot to like here, and I loved all the layers that were added to a monster movie.",The Host
42,Cineanalyst,Viral Kaiju,7,24 June 2020,"I've seen four movies from Korean writer-director Bong Joon-ho now, and ""The Host"" is the closest to his subsequent Best Picture Oscar winner ""Parasite"" (2019). Like that international breakthrough, the main characters here are comprised of a bumbling lower-class family, with the over-achievers able to accomplish no more than be unemployed with a university degree or be so hesitant so as to only win a bronze medal in archery. Likewise, it's all over the place in its genre mixing, with this one jumping from Japanese-influenced kaiju-type giant-monster flick, family drama or sitcom and adventure in search of missing daughter, virus outbreak action, and governmental and geopolitical conspiracy thriller. Unlike some of his other pictures, too, this one isn't as drenched, although some of it's still here, in environmental or socio-economic commentary, which is good given that the comedy is too absurd and the special effects too silly to take much of the movie seriously. Moreover, ""The Host,"" with its virus alternatively attributed to environmental pollution and either government incompetence or foreign attack, which nonetheless leads to widespread mask wearing, disinfection, contact tracing and medical, police and foreign impositions on liberties, has already become an eerie feature to view during the real-world pandemic in 2020. Best it be seen as an amusing diversion than a mirror to the actuality outside the screen.In popular culture, kaiju began with ""Gojira"" (Godzilla) (1954), where the monster was a metaphor for the destruction of life by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Appropriately, then, Bong revives this genre from the dead via a morgue with the toxic ingredient from embalming fluid, formaldehyde, being poured down the drain and into the Han River, with the consequent sea creature becoming a readily visible and immediate realization of the threat to humanity from water pollution. Meanwhile, the Korean police come across an uncaring and healthcare workers as quacks. The United States military industrial complex, too, is treated as malicious and incompetent, and I suspect that the twist on ""agent orange"" here by being renamed for the color ""yellow"" is a slight against Western racism towards East and Southeast Asians. Even protesters, television and mobile-phone use receive their share of mockery here. Ordinarily, as well, I might be critical of how lousy the CGI for the creature is, but even disregarding the restraints of the production's budget compared to Hollywood blockbusters, it seems fitting that the effects not be too good, lest it be accidentally appear to be in earnest. This is a fun movie.",The Host

45,sol-,Monster,6,5 October 2017,"Quarantined after coming in contact with an amphibious sea monster, a slow-witted man flees and searches for his daughter when nobody else believes she has survived the monster attack in this South Korean horror movie. Powered by incredible special effects, 'The Host' has some breathtaking moments as the creature leaps around the infrastructure of Seoul with acrobatic precision; scenes of it plowing mercilessly into crowds have quite an impact too. The bits without the monster are a lot less engaging though. Part of the issue is that the characters are hard to warm to. Kang-ho Song is the most likable with his dedication to his daughter, yet the film uncomfortably plays his social awkwardness and dimwitted nature for laughs. The other issue is that the film packs too much in thematically without exploring every issue. Subplots include thoughtless disposal of dangerous chemicals, government paranoia, a possible virus, and the conviction of government agents that the protagonist is slow-witted due to being infected by the monster. The film has received considerable praise over the years for raising so many ideas, but with none explored in particular depth, this is a film that only really comes alive when the monster is on screen. Fortunately though, it is a great-looking creature, and one that always seems more confused by its human surroundings than genuinely evil.",The Host

The night scenes are very dark and difficult to interpret, but the monster holds up wonderfully in broad daylight. Character development is good, something most monster movies neglect entirely. My main objection would be the film trying to do too much and not quite tying everything together. Make no mistake, this is no man in a suit, plodding monster movie.

48,howard.schumann,Plenty of thrills and scary moments,9,2 October 2006,"Korea's top-grossing film of all time The Host (the original Korean title is ""Creature"") is a monster movie with a difference. Seen by ten million people during the first three weeks of its Korean release, the film directed by Bong Joon-ho (Memories of Murder), combines genre-typical special effects with family drama, comedy, and political satire. Heroism in the film belongs not to a super hero but to a slightly dysfunctional working class family that bands together when it counts to battle a mutant tadpole that has abducted a member of the family. The film has a pricey $10 million US price tag but made record sales at Cannes and has multiple studios bidding for the remake rights.Set in Seoul, the Park family operates a snack food stand near the Han River selling squid, candy and beer to picnickers at the beach. Slow-witted Kang-Du (Kang-ho Song) works the counter when he's not sleeping or irritating his father Hie-bong (Byun Hie-bong). He is devoted to his teenage daughter Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko) and is saving up coins to buy her a new cell phone. The Park family also includes his sister Nam-ju (Bae Doo-na), a world-class archer, and his brother Nam-il (Park Hae-il) who is well educated but hasn't found a job and doesn't seem to be looking very hard.The fun starts when a US Army scientist orders his Korean assistant to pour gallons of deadly formaldehyde down the drain and into the Han River. A few years later, fishermen see an odd-looking tadpole but let it go on its way. Big mistake. Enhanced by special effects developed by a San Francisco outfit, The Orphanage FX house, the cute little tadpole soon becomes a monster fish the size of a truck that threatens the community. Spoiling a perfectly good summer afternoon, it comes out of the river to capture and kill hordes of innocent bystanders. The creature has no designs for world conquest. It is just hungry and eats whatever or whoever is available for lunch. When the monster captures Kang-du's daughter Hyun-seo, the family decides that they alone can save her.Their rescue attempt is complicated, however, by the fact that the government seeks to contain a deadly virus that is supposedly arising from contact with the monster and snatches Kang-du to put him through some gruesome-looking tests. Joon-ho uses this scenario to take some digs at authority: the Korean government's inappropriate response, the servile media, and the country's lack of ability to provide basic needs for its citizens. Not to be spared is the American government which attempts to destroy the monster that they created by their military presence, by drowning the area in a chemical called Agent Yellow (suggesting Agent Orange used in the Vietnam War).There are plenty of thrills and scary moments as the family must extricate itself from the oppressive government agents and zero in on the location where Hyun-seo is being held. Some of the best scenes are depictions of Hyun-seo's escape attempts from a sewer beneath a bridge with a young orphan. One might imagine different subtexts to explain the film: fear of the monster that lies within us, the dangers of pollution, our inherent distrust of government, a Western-type arrogance that would rather create lies about a nonexistent virus than face up to reality. Whatever one you decide on will work. The bottom line, however, is that The Host is a scary monster movie that is well crafted and highly entertaining and has a compelling human factor that is both comic and tragic.",The Host
49,Movie_Muse_Reviews,An old school but bold approach to the monster movie genre,8,27 June 2017,"After ""Jaws,"" monster/large predator movies grew into a cheesy pop culture phenomenon, particularly by the late '90s. ""The Host,"" Korean filmmaker Joon-ho Bong's 2006 riff on the genre that once launched the blockbuster, is a rare return to form for creature features, and maybe the closest any movie has come to evoking Steven Spielberg's style in the 21st century.Most monster movies made in the last 20 years feature a fearsome juggernaut of a beast that carefully picks off each member of the cast one by one throughout the film. ""The Host"" disposes of that formula, opting for family-driven narrative, though many R-rated monster movie hallmarks remain. In response to the B-movie tendencies of most monster flicks, modern filmmakers have gone with a more reserved approach, like in Ridley Scott's ""Alien,"" keeping the creature hidden or obscured for most of the film, usually until the climax. Bong steamrolls us with the mutant fish-lizard-beast the first chance he gets. The high- intensity attack sequence is easily a highlight of the film, juggling fun and entertaining notes with terrifying moments that put us in the shoes of the people running for their lives.In the aftermath of that attack, young Park Hyun-seo (Ah-sung ko) is essentially kidnapped by the monster, though her lazy father, Park Gang-Doo (Kang-ho Song), aunt (Doona Bae), uncle and grandfather all believe her dead. When they find out she's alive, they plan to break free from a government quarantine site (contact with the monster is believed to result in the contraction of a deadly virus) and save her.To do so, Gang-Doo and his family must push back on a clearly misguided emergency responses system that's been put in place. There's a lot of background context to the film's events with the disease element and the world governments' handling of the situation, none of which have a direct bearing on the plot, but do lightly color the way we view and think about the film. The opening prologue also chillingly implies that the monster is a result of irresponsible human attitudes toward the environment. You could argue Bong and co-writers Won-jun Ha and Chul-hyun Baek are suggesting we have only ourselves to blame for the Park family's suffering.In the end, however, it becomes clear that Bong's priority in ""The Host"" is entertainment with a payoff. He wants to deliver the thrills of a monster movie, just in his own way. He has a brilliant way of twisting sequences in ways that defy expectation. You think you know exactly what's coming, and it does indeed come, but not in the way – or at the time – you expect it to. Both Bong's direction and the script do an excellent job of recognizing Hollywood conventions and altering them in such a way that feels novel and exciting, but still ultimately deliver the satisfying payoffs that genre fans prefer. Bong isn't Spielberg, but he's someone who is bringing his own take to a concept born and popularized in the West, that has gone through iterations good and bad. He's sorted through those iterations and pulled out what interests him as an auteur, and he is able to punctuate the film's most memorable moments with his distinctive style and vision. In today's special effects era, ""The Host"" might seem like nothing special on the surface, but the family-centric bones of the narrative make it a compelling watch that both speaks to a very familiar sub-genre and imbues it with unique vision.~Steven CThanks for reading!

50,jzappa,Clever Take on Environmental Consequences of Pollution,9,30 March 2007,"The Host is an enormously entertaining monster film that begins slowly, steadily, rivetingly, and we suddenly are introduced in the most masterfully cinematic way. The creature is not hidden as it first attacks, it doesn't pop out of nowhere, it gains just as much shock from the audience as it would from those two devices by presenting in in an almost nonchalant, docile way as we see it first with the perspective of a group of people who are in complete disbelief of what they're about to experience. However, though the creature attacks and kills, the havoc it directly wreaks is not the focus of the film. The film hones in on a single family's journey to seek out the mutation and rescue the youngest of the family, who is still alive in the creature's makeshift pit of doom, a sewer hole. We come to know this family much better with much more interesting and original backstories than, say, the family in Independence Day or The Day After Tomorrow. There is a lot of odd internal conflict and unraveling that happens, and nothing we expect as an American audience can truly be expected, or unexpected.Something quite interesting about this film that a lot of directors of any nationality would have a hard time doing. This film is a monster film, a disaster film, and yet when a young girl is carried off in the first fifteen minutes by the creature, the next thing we see is the family crying in an overelaborate, blown up, melodramatic way, rolling on the floor, screaming, wiggling, creating an amoeba of bodies squirming and such, in a way that is actually played for laughs. Most films can hardly get a rise out of your average audience by making light of a small child's peril, and this film not only does just that but also completely maintains its tone as a monster thriller.Something I find relieving, as an American in this time of political hell, is this film's seemingly subtle characterization of everything American that is involved in it. The film opens with a condescending, closed-minded American chemist working in South Korea ordering his Korean assistant, with complete ignorance to to the assistant's objections and reasoning, to dump dozens upon dozens of leftover bottles of formaldehyde and other toxic chemicals into the Han River. Hence, the creature. There are several more increasingly barefaced instances throughout the film. The Cincinnati Enquirer made a beef about this, being quite a slanted and Conservative newspaper, and I never thought that its complaint, despite its otherwise positive notice of the film, would be credible. To my surprise, it was, but I find it endearing, especially at the height of the Bush administration's thundering wrath upon the world.However, this is not intended to make heroes out of Koreans. For people who kill and abuse animals indiscriminately, have no laws against authentic animal abuse and deaths in movies and TV, and see animals as nothing more than objects, I don't see how they're justified as the particular country that should be making films antagonizing us for contaminating waters. Having had terrible experiences with animal deaths in Korean films, despite how immensely good they tend to be, I checked thoroughly on www.kids-in-mind.com for the content of this movie to be sure that no animals are harmed in any way, and there are none. However, even still, there is a character who says, ""Old people say that if an animal kills a human, that animal deserves to be torn limb from limb."" The logic behind this is ridiculous, animals killing entirely out of defense or natural predatory tendencies, and human beings killing them for not only those reasons but also profit and lack of consideration or respect. I find myself sympathizing in a way with the creature itself, a fish that has mutated into a giant carnivorous monster. I know that most people that read this review will think of me as a whining bleeding heart, but can you say I'm wrong? Really, think about how I could possibly not have a point to ponder.Like most Korean films, there is fantastic cinematography. The Host is a joy to look at it like all of the other Korean films I've seen, yet the special effects are, despite how entertaining they are, a bit noticeably unreal. Godzilla was released in 1998. Nine years later, with all of the progression we've made, we must have some way that we can make creatures more realistic.Overall, The Host is enormously entertaining. I may have completely changed tones throughout my review, but know that it is only personal peeves of mine that make it only just ever so slightly less than great for me.

An American scientist dumps a toxic chemical down the drain and the liquid flows into a river with very nasty results. At first the public spreads rumors of a strange creature surfacing on the river. The monster reaches landfall and grabs a girl and disappears with her. She is presumed dead but makes a phone call from the sewers very much alive but trapped. The cell phone signal is tracked to a particular place under a bridge and a posse sets out to kill the beast. They use smoke bombs to sedate it and several improvised weapons are used to attempt to finish it off. The host is better than most films of this type as it contains some funny moments and a good portrait of Korean family unity. Give it a shot.,The Host
52,jadavix,"Very good, but with a weak middle act",7,22 November 2018,"""The Host"" reminds me of a more recent Korean flick, ""The Wailing"". Both are undeniably good movies with superior direction, photography, acting, and a seemingly endless supply of wit and intelligence to the screenplay. Both also seriously lost my attention in the middle parts, and both were overlong.You probably already know what the movie's about: a monster in the Han river in South Korea, presumably fostered by the dumping of waste into its waters.In lesser movies, this would be enough. And there are many, many, many more movies that have dealt with this premise, from ""Godzilla"" to ""Them"" to ""C.H.U.D."". However, ""The Host"" also features an amusing dysfunctional family, and the idiotic reaction of the Korean and American governments to the problem, spreading misinformation that only makes the problem worse.The scene where the monster first appears is both frightening and insightful. I liked the way some of the people didn't even notice the monster was there because they were zoned out with their iPods, or passing by in public transport and thus gone blank.It's when the government's response comes into play that the movie wavers, unfortunately, and I think it might do so deliberately. In any other movie, the presence of hazmat-suited officials gathering people for shadowy experiments would be terrifying, but in ""The Host"", they seem just as inept as the protagonist, and their attempts to control the situation are less sinister than idiotic and ineffectual. I believe this part of the movie went on too long to show that the actions of the government were also long-winded and pointless.I just wish the movie didn't feel like it had to become that way itself in order to show this.",The Host
53,Polaris_DiB,Creature feature,7,23 August 2007,"Korean creature feature involving a family trying to save their youngest girl from the grasps of a hideously deformed monster that appeared in a local river. It's a little uneven... some of the movie is pure awesomeness and fun, some of it drags like a snail on wet cement. However, it's neat in that it lets the monster attack in broad daylight and it doesn't mind disposing of key characters for stretches at a time.This movie is at it's best when throwing the monster out into the public and letting it snap at a few heels; it's at it's worst when it actually makes comments on environmentalism, American militancy, and the like. Still, it was neat having that there, considering how much of this movie was tongue-in-cheek... might as well throw some commentary in there for the heck of it, it doesn't ruin the proceeds--just slows it down a bit.It's no Gojira, but pretty much anyone interested in this genre will be rewarded.--PolarisDiB",The Host
54,dfranzen70,It came from beneath the river.,6,20 June 2019,"This Korean horror-thriller is pretty intense and overcomes its questionable CGI with engaging performances and a roller coaster ride of a plot. Some time ago, a South Korean scientist - at the direction of an American military doctor - dumped formaldehyde into a lab sink that eventually feeds into Seoul's Han River. Flash forward to the present, and that little chemical has spawned some kind of creature that looks straight out of H.R. Giger's nightmares. And now that creature is making its presence known, as it leaps from the water onto the river's well-populated banks, sending chillin' citizens scurrying for cover. One of these citizens is a layabout named Gang-doo, a grown man working for his father Hie-bong in a snack trailer parked alongside the river. Gang-doo happens to be outside with his daughter, Hyun-seo, when the creature emerges from the water; in the ensuing chaos, Hyun-seo is captured by the creature and taken into the river. What's more, authorities come to believe that the creature is passing along a horrific virus to all who come in contact with it. Poor Gang-dpp, who got some of the being's blood on his face, is quarantined along with his father, his brother Nam-il, and his medal-winning-archer sister Nam-joo. But is Hyun-seo actually dead? Wouldn't be much of a story if she were, and so the family must escape quarantine and track her down. And thus the plot is set into frantic and frenetic motion. Gang-doo is definitely supposed to be the loser of the bunch, with his brother being a college graduate (unemployed) and his sister excelling at shooting arrows; even young Hyun-seo isn't a big fan of her dad. But where this movie succeeded for me was in how the story was told. This is not an entirely predictable tale about one man flourishing against all odds. It's at least partly a horror movie, so there are deaths and suffering, and not always when expected. The movie kept me on my toes by establishing that good guys or not, there are no boundaries when it comes to the devastation that the creature - also not seen as either wholly terrible or sympathetic - unleashes. Director Joon-ho Bong would later give us the very excellent Snowpiercer in 2013 and Okja in 2017, and the difference in special effects is evident. The Host came out in 2003, and perhaps for that reason its effects seem pedestrian and obvious. When the creature rounds a corner in the sewers in pursuit of food (humans), it often looks like humans running in front of a green screen. But the acting itself is very good, particularly Kang-ho Song (Gang-doo) and Ko Asung (Hyun-seo). They had some fine writing to work with, too, which is more than I can say about siblings Nam-joo and Nam-il, who aren't given much to do. (Doona Bae, who plays Nam-joo, has very few lines in the movie.) And, circling back to the creature itself, I think the makeup/prop departments did a terrific job in bringing this, uh, monster to life. Large, semi-opaque eyes, long tentacles, multiple rigid limbs. The abilities to swim and climb and to propel itself using those grabbers. It's just when the creature moves that the facade is temporarily exposed. But overall, this was a fun movie to watch, with some genuine laughs (usually at the expense of Gang-doo).",The Host
55,dee.reid,"""The Host"" with the most - What most monster movies should be",10,26 July 2007,"If by any chance you go to your local video store this weekend looking for whatever's hot in the new movie releases on DVD, skip the Hollywood stuff and go straight for ""The Host,"" South Korean director Bong Joon-ho's sci-fi monster action epic that received little attention here in the United States, but is one of the highest-grossing movies in South Korea. I remember listening to a radio station on the morning of Tuesday July 24, 2007, and the DJ announced the new releases on DVD; I was startled to learn that ""The Host"" was not on that list.That's America for you.""The Host"" is not like most sci-fi movies produced in Japan or the United States, in that it places an unusual amount of attention on the characters, rather than action and special effects, and with plenty of comedy, family drama and political satire, it's easy to forget that first and foremost, ""The Host"" is a monster movie, and a damn good one too.""The Host"" is a movie I've waited for over a year to see and when I finally saw it, I was not the slightest bit disappointed. The film opens at an American military base in 2000, where an American scientist orders a Korean subordinate to pour a bunch of aging chemicals down the drain. The underling points out that the drain empties straight into Seoul, South Korea's Han River. The American doesn't care, and the underling does as he's ordered.Six years later, the family Park runs a food stand on the shores of the majestic Han, just across the river from the skyscrapers of modern Seoul. The family's head honcho, Park Hie-bong (Hie-bong Byeon), takes pride in this business venture and is holding this family together by the skin of his teeth, but his son Gang-Du (Kang-ho Song) has a habit of sleeping on the job and occasionally eating the merchandise. A daughter named Nam-Joo (Du-na Bae) is an Olympic-level champion archer with a tendency to choke. Another brother, Nam-il (Hae-il Park), is a university graduate embittered by his inability to find work. The brightest of this family is the young and dear Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko, Hollywood better keep their eyes open for this one), Gang-Du's daughter.Before you know it, the peaceful calm is shattered and the monster makes its grand entrance (and, boy, does it know how to make an entrance), rushing headfirst into crowds of terrified people and chomping down on those unfortunate enough to get within its reach. This monster, designed by the American effects studio The Orphanage, is not anything like Godzilla but is something closer to the offspring of ""Alien"" and ""Jaws,"" after swimming in the Toxic Avenger's cesspool.The government soon realizes it has a national crisis on its hands and hurriedly evacuates the area and quarantines those who had come into contact with the creature when it's learned it is the carrier of a lethal virus. But the movie wisely never goes down the path of most sci-fi monster movies with brave military types and thick-rimmed scientists standing around talking. Instead, it simply tells the tale of one dysfunctional family's attempts to pull itself together in the face of a great tragedy: during the initial attack, the creature snatches off poor Hyun-seo and drags her to its lair in Seoul's sewers, and the Park family is forced to break out of quarantine to try and track her down.One thing I like about most monster movies are the effects, and the monsters, which are essentially effects themselves. As a fan of monster movies and Godzilla in particular, ""The Host"" doesn't disappoint in this department, but its charm is the thriving and living cast of Korean actors (many of whom are unknown to American audiences), not the nasty amphibian running amok and eating people. These are people with real problems, crises, and feelings and express those feelings in a believable fashion because that's the one thing this movie doesn't have, and that is Hollywood trickery.Lastly, some may be disturbed by the running undercurrent of anti-Americanism. First of all, as an American movie-goer, I can tell you that America gets the least of the bashing in ""The Host."" Although America gets skewered a bit and rightfully so, most of the film's best political satire is aimed at the South Korean government and its inability to handle a national crisis without resorting to borderline totalitarianism. So I encourage some of my fellow Americans to get a grip.Bong Joon-ho's ""The Host"" is a pleasant surprise from one of the last places to spring up on the international movie market. As a monster movie, it succeeds. As a monster movie with shades of comedy, family drama and political satire, it easily ranks as one of the great monster movies of the new millennium, certainly something for Godzilla fans since Japan's Big Guy seems to be reaching for his AARP card. On a side note, I've always looked forward to traveling to South Korea one day, to see what they are capable of, and if ""The Host"" is any indication of South Korean film-making talent, then consider this American as a newfound fan of South Korean cinema.10/10",The Host

57,Chris_Docker,Toxic tadpoles and organic morons,4,14 August 2006,"A slapstick horror with a monstrous galloping mutant - the result of tipping toxic chemicals from the morgue down the sink and into the river - terrorising inhabitants of Seoul by chomping on them, dumping them in a sewer for later, or infecting them with a supposedly deadly virus. Sound silly? It is. And it doesn't attempt to be much else.Gang-du is the son of a local store owner. Raised on pilfering from organic farms, lack of a certain protein has made him a moron. His daughter is captured by the monster but manages to phone Dad on a mobile phone. The family, armed with a map of the sewers on used photocopier paper, set out to rescue her.The film makes no attempt to be a spoof, nor is the humour enough to provoke belly laughs. Some good editing makes the monster occasionally scary (a cross between a tadpole and Alien), but I found two hours mind-numbingly slow.The Host's strength is its lack of ambition. It never takes itself very seriously, doesn't bother with any rules, but is more lavish than the average low-budget flick. The characters are almost comic-book in their simplicity, and the meandering plot invites us to give up hope of any real resolution and just enjoy it on its own level. At which point you will either give in, or say, as I do, that this sort of thing is done much better by the likes of Troma. I longed for the Toxic Avenger to stand up and vanquish this half-hearted attempt at modern CGIs, or for a film with the wit of Mars Attacks! to show how better to spend the money. The Host is a novelty film from Korean cinema, but will remain an irritating piece of silliness for those not prepared to indulge it.",The Host

Joon-ho's film has moments of horror, comedy, drama and social commentary that is done very well into the premise. The actors, who played the family members are giving good performance and it feels like a real family in the feature. Which i haven't seen it done in this way done before. I liked the idea that the family members have their different flaws and they later might overcome some of their misery. One of the highlights in ""The Most"" is of course, the terrific Monster designs. Which this creature is created superbly by CGI effects. Which the production team done it right for making the monster looks real. This was quite the big hit in Korean and it has find international success by audiences, especially film critics.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has the original Korean version, it also has dubbed English and French Versions on the DVD. But you could view the original Korean language with English Subtitles. DVD has an interesting commentary track by the director and film critic Tony Rayns, Deleted Scenes (Which it is mostly deleted small bits or outtakes from the film) and an rather amusing featurette with the director telling how sorry he treated the cast & crew on the feature. ""The Host"" is simply an very good movie and i think, it gets better after viewing it a couple of times. It is mostly fast-paced movie with interesting character moments but the feature only slows a bit (Especially the lead character truly suffers in one long sequence). If you haven't seen it, this is worth seeing. It was certainly one of the better movies to come out in 2007 in the U.S. Co-written by the filmmaker.

59,rooprect,One crazy horror comedy drama socio-political allegory,7,26 November 2012,"""The Host"" is as deceptive and intriguing as its title (there's currently a 6-page thread in the discussion board and we still haven't figured it out). The movie can be taken as a straightforward monster flick, a dark comedy, a sentimental drama, or a rich socio-political allegory.For the sake of this review, let's approach it as more than an action/comedy/horror flick, and let's assume it's a deeper allegory. There's definitely a lot of symbolism, lots of cultural references and outright satire for you to munch on. I think that's what makes this seemingly-ordinary monster flick into a powerful film.Right in the first scene, the director sets the tone with a caricature of Western (U.S.) muddling. Like the excellent Korean film ""Welcome to Dongmakgol"" released a year earlier, this film is not exactly complimentary toward America, so if that irritates you, you might want to skip this. But when you consider all the 80s Hollywood flicks that painted Russia as a villain, I guess it's fair enough that the USA should take its lumps.(I did want to add that the director takes a diplomatic approach, mocking the American ""establishment"" while indirectly praising the American individual. He does this by including an American tourist who's really cool. So in other words, his criticisms are not one-sided.)The plot is two-dimensional but the symbolic implications are profound. The story is about a monster that terrorizes the banks of the Han River and grabs a young girl, prompting her bumbling family to lead a rescue effort, with no help from the Korean authorities. Some say that the monster represents Western imperialism. It could represent a figurative ""attack"" on Korean culture, autonomy and sovereignty. Or it could even be taken literally to represent environmental terrors caused by American apathy.Don't worry, the USA isn't the only target here. There are some pretty good jabs at the Korean authorities too, insinuating (in a way that's both entertaining and irritating) that the Korean government is apathetic & hopeless. ""So much for Korea's new democracy,"" says one character at one point in the film. Some critics point out interesting parallels & allusions to the 1980 Gwangju Uprising (where the Korean Government botched the whole situation, killing & wounding hundreds at a student protest). Everyone is fair game in a dark satire like this. In that respect it reminded me of the excellent Veerhoven scifi satires ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Robocop"".Like all good satires, there's a nice amount of comedy to remind us not to take everything at face value. The bumbling family provides some great laughs in the first half, and certain scenes in the hospital are reminiscent of the sarcastic masterpiece ""Brazil"" with its merciless mockery of all institutional powers. The scene where they're looking for a virus in a guy's head is both riotously hilarious and profoundly disturbing.I did want to mention one thing in case you're wondering. No, the audience isn't supposed to feel sympathy for the monster, not like in ""King Kong"". I was actually surprised at that (in a good way), because the director didn't stray from his message with any gratuitous sentimentality. Normally I'm not a fan of killer animal flicks (Jaws, etc) because I usually find myself siding with the animals more readily than the humans. But this film managed to avoid all sympathies, since the monster itself is a product of human idiocy (which is explained in the first scene).Well I've just thrown a bunch of ideas at you, and I don't claim any of them to be absolute. But the point is that this seemingly-ordinary horror flick is so much more. It's entirely up to you how you want to see it. Like I said up front, you can just see it as a straightforward monster flick, but I think if you read deeper into the parallels with current Korean society, you'll get a whole lot more out of this.",The Host

After an American scientist instructs a Korean scientist to dump formaldehyde into Seoul's main river, the chemical causes a sea creature to mutate. Years later, the creature, now a giant, attacks the city. The focus of ""The Host"" is a family who the US-led authorities claim are carrying a dangerous, SARS-like virus. This is meant to distract the population from the real reason why Koreans are being dismembered. After the family's youngest member is taken by the monster, the family escapes from custody and spends the rest of the film tracking the creature down. Bloody combat with surprising casualties ensues. A rip-roaring sound mix and mostly fantastic special effects turn ""The Host"" into a very decent creature fest.

With superb New Zealand and Australian special effects completing the completely real visuals, this hungry big slobbering fish with legs and a multi lipped mouth hits the picnic park with slimy glee unmatched in monster movie-from-the-deep annals.

64,I_Ailurophile,"Smart, finely made monster movie",10,1 June 2021,"The basic premise immediately makes one wonder how a creature feature could be stretched out over 2 hours. But make no mistake, director Bong Joon-ho's reputation is well-deserved: 'The host' is a riveting, carefully crafted film that exceeds all suggested simplicity.The monster that defines the movie isn't the only threat at hand. The narrative isn't solely focused on the beast or efforts to combat it. This is much more about the desperate effort by an extended family to rescue the young daughter among them, and the willful ignorance by a bureaucratic military that inhibits them. There's much, much more going on here than just a cavalcade of death and destruction.The monster looks great, as do the effects at play. Rather than a purely mindless beast of mayhem, the entity here demonstrates complex behavior that seems very believably natural. This echoes the narrative thrust, which goes far beyond the silly B-movie romps that creature features tend to be. Careful consideration is given how society at large reacts, and the many moving parts at play. From start to finish, this is terribly engaging, a swell effort to realistically represent how the sudden appearance of a monster might play out in real life.That push in the screenplay for a more life-like course of events extends to the characters, as well. The bumbling father; the put-upon grandfather; the athletic sister; the willful, unemployed college graduate; the precocious daughter. These are individuals that are sympathetic, and relatable; whatever skills or knowledge they may have, their best resource is nothing more than their simple determination to find the abducted daughter.And for all the excitement throughout the rest of the movie, the climax is all the more thrilling as everyone pools their efforts to stop the monster. The ending is perhaps not what I expected, but perfect nonetheless, and very suitably fitting the general tone we've come to expect from Bong in his pictures.While I'd stumbled across 'The host' in the past, I never paid it much mind previously, and it was the fact that the same person behind 'Parasite' directed this creature feature that pushed me to finally watch it. I'm so glad I did, because while there are certainly visceral thrills to be had here, it's much more intelligent, thought-provoking, and deep than the average monster movie. Simply put, 'The host' is well worth watching wherever one may be able.",The Host

For the most part, it follows a lot of the same devices that have made bad American films (Primeval for example) such unwatchable tripe. But at least with this film, it takes on a few different conventions that allow us to enjoy the film.While the back story on the beast is a little ludicrous, we at least get to see what it looks like almost immediately. While an American version would certainly drag this type of imagery out, we get to see what the beast is quite early and quite often. From the first scene to the last, it is a pretty believably scary monster. Throw in the fact that this movie isn't sanitized for stupid teeny- boppers with its R rating, we get to see some true guts and blood. A couple elements in the middle of the movie did drag on for a bit too long, but at least this type of scenes weren't used to build unnecessary build-up in the first half.

The creature design reminded me of the movie ""The Relic"" or like the baddies in ""Hell Boy"". It wasn't really original nor all that well done. CG was OK maybe satisfactory. However, the story jumped off the deep end pretty much after midway with kooky quarantines and wailing protagonists, the director and writers pretty much lose a grip on their focus, and the movie plunges into garbage.

72,lewiskendell,Cloverfield isn't the only good monster movie of the last few years.,7,15 April 2011,"The Host is a pretty cool, if uneven, South Korean monster flick. The premise is simple enough. Dangerous chemicals intentionally leaked into the Han River produce a freakish aquatic mutated animal that goes on a rampage, apparently eating a lot of people. Including the daughter of a seemingly slow-witted man, who later receives a call from the girl and becomes convinced that she is still alive. The man and his two adult siblings and father escape from the military authorities that have taken control of the area, and set out to find the girl. The Host is an action-packed monster feature, but it's also hilarious and tragic. And occasionally dull, if only for brief periods of time. The inconsistent pacing of the movie was really my only big complaint, and did hurt it some in my eyes. The beginning and ending are strong, but the middle lags a bit. The creature itself is incredibly well-designed, which is good because we see a lot of it. It looks more like a living animal than a CGI creation. The actors interact with it nicely in a way that helps immerse it even more into the ""reality"" of the movie.The combination of thrills, humor, and poignancy make The Host something I definitely recommend.

The screenplay is particularly adept at magnifying the trivial issues that peripherally co-exist, while never losing touch with the key elements of the story or narrative. What results is a fascinating, multi-faceted picture that displays all the key elements of dry humour, suspense, adventure and tragedy.Whilst almost all of the cast would be unrecognisable to English-speaking audiences, of particular note is the leading character, a perennial loser who's daughter is ""abducted"" by the beast, during the initial mêlée on the river bank. His impassioned, tireless, yet mostly frivolous attempts to locate her, almost always run afoul another hideous encounter with the mutation, a ghastly toxic evolution resembling a hybrid of squid, catfish and shark. Only American veteran actor Scott Wilson provides familiarity, but his cameo appearance, despite being integral to the story that unfolds, is brief and largely extraneous.Stylishly unique, there are moments of deep symbolism and emotional intensity, boldly contrasted with unsettling displays of graphic horror, and almost slapstick comedy. A real sleeper.",The Host
74,punishmentpark,"""Free Park Gang-Doo!""",9,3 April 2016,"Quentin Tarantino once advised me (not personally, I shall add) to see this, and it blew away the first time. This later time around, I am still very much impressed, but I can't give it 10 out of 10 anymore. Especially the opening sequence is still easily worth a full 10, but other parts just aren't all that perfect, but still good or even very good.The characters (especially big sleepy lug Park Gang-Doo, adorable and smart Park Hyun-seo and the wise grandfather) are all perfectly thought out and wonderfully played, the story has lots of clever, weird or endearing elements and details in it and the monster itself is really a great concoction of weird, agile, filthy and brutal, all rolled into one. The fact that the little girl who is taken, does not survive, makes this one stand out even more within the monster-film standard.Really, a work of monster-film art. A big 9 out of 10.",The Host
75,oneguyrambling,Spreads itself a little too thin - but at the core an effective monster movie.,8,17 December 2010,"This was described by many Western critics as a Monster movie with a twist, but it isn't that much of a monster movie, even though the creature is pretty cool.It actually isn't much of any one thing, the focus of the film switches back and forth along the way from a social commentary, to a family drama, to an indictment on government cover-ups - all with a big axolotl looking thing running around in the background eating people.To start with those damn Americans order the dumping of dangerous chemicals into the main river in Korea. As with Nazis in the 70s and 80s it now seems you can have Americans do anything bad and the audience will simply nod, I don't know if President Bush ever thought that would go on his CV ""turned Americans into a cinematic Nazi equivalent as indefensible bad guys in the span of one decade"".Anyway a few years later a large monster appears and eats some Koreans, but that is beside the point.At this stage the point is that a small family run kiosk happens to be located on the shore of the river. It is manned by the family senior, his loser son Gang-Du and his cute 10 year old daughter Hyun-Seo, who is the pet of the entire family being the only child. Also around but not present are the high achiever daughter Nam-Joo, a world class archer, and also high achieving other son Nam-Il, both of whom resent Gang-Du for his perceived stupidity and laziness.At the initial the never before seen monster is spotted as what appears to be a 9 – 10 foot black slimy thing hanging from under a bridge in full view. A pretty tall story given its size and proximity to a large number of people but there you go, perhaps a younger 8 foot version was better at ""blending in"".Once ashore the 15 foot beast (stay tuned it seems to change size a lot) wreaks havoc, perhaps it is its way of saying ""Don't you look at me"", but basically it kills a bunch of people and takes Hyun-Seo away into the river across to the other bank and swallows her.Case closed right? Monster movie for sure.No, now the movie changes again, we forget the monster and change tack as the army comes in and quarantines the entire area The Crazies and 28 Weeks Later style. Pictures of the deceased are laid out in full view of mourners, including one of Hyun Seo.The family now include all those mentioned above who for some reason blame Gang-Du for allowing a creature of variable size, but definitely too big for a fishbowl, take a small girl away. In any case the family members swear revenge on the beastie.The army questions all witnesses to the event and upon learning that Gang-Du was actually in contact briefly with the creature he and many others are isolated for testing. Reports come out that the creature is the ""Host"" of a virus that is yet to be fully defined aside from the assumption that it could be very nasty and contagious.Moving on, Gang-Du receives a call from Hyun-Seo, she ain't dead after all, and the film becomes a rescue mission, only Gang-Du is literally stuck in a plastic tent at this stage, and no-one will believe his claims in any case.He and his family escape from captivity with disturbing ease (if there really was a highly contagious killer-virus that is), and the rest of the film follows their exploits as they search for Hyun-Seo and the monster.The monster is there but it seemed to be as more of a distraction from the various other messages that the filmmakers were trying to sneak in along the way.Put another way the interactions with the monster were few and far between, and when they did come they were hardly scary or breathtaking.The appearance of the creature was well designed, but as alluded to the size seemed to fluctuate more than Oprah. Sometimes it appeared gargantuan, at other times it seemed half as big.Before the credits roll there is sacrifice, death, betrayal, fatal mistakes are made, separation and my favourite unnecessary surgery, all with the beautiful backdrop of deliberate government misinformation and cover-up.I liked The Host, but at two hours it was just too long. As a ""monster"" movie it was only OK but with all the other elements thrown in it grew a little muddled and became unfocused, leading to me wondering exactly what audience the filmmakers were targeting.Final Rating – 7 / 10. This isn't your typical Hollywood fare to say the least, but that doesn't necessarily say it is a great movie.",The Host
76,Maciste_Brother,Tiny & hysterical monster movie,2,15 January 2008,"I'm a big fan of monster movies. The first film I saw on the big screen was a monster movie (the original GODZILLA at a matinée for kids) and decided to watch THE HOST on cable TV because of my fondness for the genre. Well, I was seriously underwhelmed. There's only one monster and it's as big as an elephant and it looks like the monster in THE RELIC. Not very impressive, if you ask me.The plot didn't make any sense at all and the characters were endlessly hysterical from beginning to end.Honestly, I have to say the film was almost unwatchable. It seems the whole story/film was dreamed up by some 9 year old uber geek. The acting was embarrassing. It's just a goofy monster movie, why does everyone overact uncontrollably, like chickens with their heads cut off? The film had many ponderous slow motion scenes, a la Peter Jackson, which made me giggle. Seriously, skip this flick. You're better off watching GODZILLA VS THE SMOG MONSTER if you're looking for a wacky monster movie.",The Host

At moments the comedy is just superb and has the audience in stitches. All the actors in the film play their roles brilliantly, whether its the courageous Grandfather, the loser Dad, the drunk Uncle or the quiet Aunt.The monster itself is not the scariest, but when it comes at full speed, its quite terrifying. Yes, the special effects are weak, but Korean cinema has only begun to show us the wonders of Korean Cinema, with fantastic drama's such as 'Bittersweet' to comedies such as 'Arahan' to martial art spectacles such as 'City of Violence', Korean Cinema is quickly becoming a top contender against Hong Kong and Japan.Wonderful.",The Host
78,Vomitron_G,"Everything a Monster Movie should be, and so much more!",9,1 April 2007,"Director Joon-ho Bong knows about monster movies and undoubtedly has seen his share of them. You can tell by experiencing GWOEMUL. He knows about the clichés and aspects done-to-death before in this genre. And instead of avoiding them, he deliberately leaves them in the movie, and plays with them in a way that for sure has got to put a grin on every monster-fan's face out there. For one thing, the creature's sole reason of existence (immediatley portrayed in the opening-sequence) is the only right reason for a movie like THE HOST. People unfamiliar with the monster movie genre might roll their eyes and fear for the worst, but when you link that opening-scene with the quirkiness of the following sequence (the introduction of our protagonists), you just know that GWOEMUL will wink at you with a sh!t-eating grin on more than one occasion. Yes indeed, as a viewer, you're in for a ride. Not necessarily a roller-coaster-ride, but you will get more than you bargained for.In more than one way, THE HOST is a witty and painful draw-out to Americans in general. But the always present humorous undertones make it never offensive in any way (though the word 'laughing-stock' did come to mind). Where a movie like, for example, the original Japanese GOJIRA is far more subtle in its indictment against the Americans (It doesn't even dare to mention their involvement in any way, even though history is there to back them up), GWOEMUL is far more explicit in its mockery. A few examples maybe? Let's see... It's an American 'scientist' that causes the giant mutated creature to exist. Every self-respecting monster movie, at some point in its plot, has got to have scenes where the military comes to the rescue and tries to control the situation, right? In THE HOST its the American military that enters the scenery. Only to prove themselves highly incompetent in taking any action whatsoever. At one point, son Park (almost lobotomized by those evil American scientists) escapes a secret lab, holding hostage a nurse while pointing a syringe with (supposedly) infected blood at her. When bursting out of the lab, into daylight, he finds the American soldiers... throwing a barbecue! Of course he escapes. Not much good in trying to stop a drug-crazed lab-rat and a hostage with a bunch of sausages, right? And just wait until you see that malevolent cross-eyed American doctor telling what tremendous lies his government released upon the Korean population. But the Korean medical staff and government also get there fair share of criticism. They are portrayed as spineless puppets, some fearful of the Americans, others corrupt and willing to accept bribes.And what about the fact that it's not the military or some heroic couple, but a severely dysfunctional family setting out to battle the creature in the end? With God-loving families being the cornerstones of a healthy American nation and all, I'm sure that would be completely unthinkable in a Hollywood re-make of GWOEMUL. Now that's what makes this movie different: It has no restrictions and benefits from it as a general movie. It has some of the best edged-out protagonists I've ever seen in a monster movie. We've got a father with three kids and no wife, desperately trying to make ends meet. His son, who's brain-functions seem to work in a rather abnormal manner. The son's daughter, a bright young motherless child (totally worthy of her father's undying love) who'll unfortunately go through the biggest agony of them all. His sister, pursuing a sports-career but seemingly unable to strike gold. And his well-educated brother who just doesn't seem to be able getting off unemployment any time soon. Family-members with severe issues, thinned out in numbers (yes, people do die in this movie), betrayed by a friend and aided by a homeless bum, saving the day. Not even because they love their country or want to save the city's population, but more out of anger, frustration, revenge and love for only those dearest to them, or so it seems. True anti-heroes. It's funny, touching and above all, entertaining to behold.Oh, and I almost forgot about the main attraction of this movie... The creature is a marvelous creation. The special effects team didn't even try to cover up the fact that it's completely made out of CGI (by, for instance, keeping it in the shades most of the time). They didn't have to, 'cause it looks mighty good. It moves in a very believable and original manner. Damn fast too. And the best thing: You get to see it in all its glory after even a merely 15 minutes or so. Kicking people around and munching on them in broad daylight. Simply delightful! See it sweep across the bridge with its tail! See it vomit an engrossing amount of bones! See it provide the most effective jump-scare of the whole movie!Just go and see THE HOST. It's probably the best monster movie you'll see this year, featuring one cool-as-hell giant slimy creature. And it's not even made by some fancy Hollywood studio with a whole lotta money. Eat that, you Americans.Ehrr... I didn't sound too offensive now, did I? I do like Americans, really. Well... some of 'em.",The Host
79,Prashast_Singh,The Host Review: A roller coaster ride all the way!,9,6 October 2017,"Movie: The Host (12)Rating: 4.5/5I was quite curious to see this film for multiple reasons including the presence of Song Kang-ho. But after I watched it, I realized there's a lot more to love, appreciate and remember as well. Bong Joon-ho's efficient direction holds the film, and the visual effects impress, too. The film's worth watching on a Blu-ray for its decent cinematography, visuals and action scenes. THE HOST is decently executed, and its not being excessively gory makes it an interesting watch for kids as well. They are bound to love it. The director's approach towards the film's genre is interesting and he binds action, emotions and thrills very well in the film. The screenplay is excellent, as the film doesn't take too long in setting up the story and characters. The editing too is a major plus.Technically, it's one of the best South Korean films. From visual effects to action scenes: everything is executed and presented very well. As far as the performances are concerned, every actor does a great job, but of course it's Song Kang-ho who takes the lead with his top notch performance. THE HOST is undoubtedly an excellent and memorable action-horror flick which is a must watch for anyone who loves watching films.",The Host
80,areatw,Crappy Korean horror hyped beyond belief,3,15 July 2018,"If you ever need reminding that Korean cinema produces garbage too, then watch 'The Host'. As someone who has seen a lot of Korean films and generally thinks the standard of Korean cinema is high, this one was terrible. It's no better than a low-budget, crappy American horror with awful CGI and special effects, with the only difference being that 'The Host' has subtitles. If this had been an American production I have no doubt that people would be slating it for being cheap and trashy.The fact that many of the users who are raving about this film, awarding it 9 and 10 stars, have only ever written 1 review in their lifetime (which is for this film) tells you all you need to know - fake paid reviews. There is nothing even remotely good about 'The Host' that can justify such rave reviews. The plot is generic, the acting is terrible in parts, and the CGI/special effects are awful, even for 2006.

82,ElijahCSkuggs,Best Creature Film In Years...,9,22 January 2007,"""The Host"" is just another reason why Koreans are quickly emerging as the most creative, personal, and daring filmmakers working today. Circumventing around the illegal dumping of toxic chemicals, a busy Korean river becomes home to a large carnivorous sea-creature. It's bipedal ability gives it access to the bustling river shore where hundreds of citizens flock each day, and where a particular ""down on their luck"" family runs a convenience stand. After a terrific opening action sequence with the said monster attacking, and scores upon scores of people running for their lives, the beast leaps away into the water with a small girl in grasp. The girl, the daughter of one of the aforementioned stand owners is thought dead until certain plot changes arise, and the characters set off for the child. Of course though, there are other plot transitions that add depth to each character, as well blockades to their progress, but this film is really at its best when the creature is on screen and the action is in full throttle. The acting is great with touches of comedy here and there, and the direction, music, and cinematography all add to the experience. There's even room for a few morality lessons if one is privy to listen. Though ""The Host"" isn't exactly a horror film, it does have thrills and adventure similar to ""Jurassic Park,"" and mixes realism with fantasy very convincingly.

The simple story is of an evil doctor pouring dirty formaldehyde down a drain which goes into the Han River, which causes the mutation and fuel for the title character, a specimen that you have to see to believe. The special effects are great, the film is crisply shot and the part about the father trying to find his daughter who was captured by this monster is very good.

84,MrGKB,Late-night creature-feature fare...,6,18 January 2008,"...had me dozing several times throughout its overlong running time, much like a number of its lead characters. I can only guess I'm getting too old for this sort of B-movie silliness. I mean no disrespect for B-movie silliness, loving the Godzilla genre as much as the next geek, but the combination of bad dubbing, haphazard storytelling and often inane dialog, all coupled with mostly inscrutable Korean actors, left me scratching my head wondering what all the fuss was about.On the plus side, the monster looked quite nice thanks to sfx work by The Orphanage and Weta Workshop, among others, and for its paltry $11mil budget, this Korean box office smash had surprisingly high production values. Still, decent cinematography and so on can't compensate for the mostly cardboard characters and slipshod storytelling that flops and lurches almost as much as the titular critter on the rampage. Once the initial attack is over (and that sequence is actually quite exciting), you can safely skip to the last ten minutes or so without missing a thing.Worthy of purchase only by monster-movie nerds, ""The Host"" epitomizes the sort of junk that ends up on very late-night television to aid insomniacs in getting some much needed rest, and will probably remain of interest to movie trivia buffs for the brief appearance of Scott ""C.S.I.""

85,vip_ebriega,"Frightening, funny, exciting, satirical and so much more. I love this!",9,30 May 2007,"My Take: A terrifically scary monster picture... that's more than just another monster picture. I was so prepared to view this kind of movie, maybe even for a very long time already, or was I really? I've been seeing B-monster movies all my life. Sea-monsters are very common already. But was I really prepared? I found out very fast, only a couple of minutes. For in those minutes, there was already something happening, that would soon shape the events in the entire film. But ""The Host"" (or ""Gwoemul"") isn't just a scary movie (as I found out later on in the film), it's also a fine comedy, a political metaphor and a thrilling action film altogether. In any genre, ""The Host"" is superb. It proves to be a thrilling horror film in the heart-pounding first minutes, but it also proves a lot more after wards. The film is also funny, thanks to some fine tongue-in-cheek humor from Korea's finest (I have yet to know their names). The film also, as I've heard from those who watched it with me, is supposed to symbolize a politics in Korea these days. I don't see how, but I suggest you see it again when the DVD comes out, and find out for yourself (As I will to myself).It may be hard for director Joon-ho Bong to fit numerous genres in one film, but it tuns out gloriously. For those who haven't seen this yet, I suggest you go see it now. Their is nothing to regret about it.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",The Host
86,KnightsofNi11,Monster movie madness,8,21 January 2015,"It's been years since the first time I watched this brilliantly badass monster movie, but last night I watched it for a second time and it's just as wickedly fun as I remember. The Host is a film that proves why Korean cinema owns the monster genre. Taking place in Seoul, South Korea, it is a film about a giant man eating fish monster that emerges from the Han River and proceeds to wreak havoc on the inhabitants of Seoul. It follows a family whose daughter is taken by the creature, and their desperate attempts to get her back. Going into The Host, it's not what you would expect. It's a surprisingly fitting blend of creature feature horror, compelling family drama, and quirky comedy satire, three elements that work charmingly well together in some weird way. It's a movie that breaks a lot of horror/monster film conventions which surprisingly does the movie a lot of good. For one, we see our scaly green friend in the full glory of midday sunlight about 20 minutes into the film. Nothing is left to the imagination as The Host gets right to the point. The opening exposition scene of the film shows a scientist being ordered to dump countless bottles of formaldehyde down the drain which runs off into the river, so any mystery element surrounding our creature is removed, which frees up the filmmakers to just go nuts and have fun with the baddie as he viciously terrorizes Koreans in broad daylight. Some people might hate this. I love it. Some of the best movies of this genre often have some sort of undertone, and The Host definitely fulfills this aspect. The eco- friendly message of this flick is comically overt, but the over-the- top nature of the opening scene sets the tone for a heavy handed message brought to you in the most abrasive and bloody way possible. Come for the monster madness, stay for the poignant ecological subtext (subtext being a term used lightly here). There is no hiding the fact that this movie can be silly and extreme, but it doesn't make a point to hide this either. It embraces its wild nature in a perfect way, making it a very easy film to just enjoy the hell out of. And to top it all off it's a beautifully shot film as well! There are some expertly crafted compositions set within the ominous beauty of Seoul's sewers or its immaculate bridges. We've got a great blend of intense close-ups and Kurosawa-esque wides. It handles action scenes incredibly well, while the dialogue heavy scenes carry just as much weight. There is no doubt that these filmmakers knew exactly what they were doing from start to finish, and this is reflected in virtually every aspect of the film. For all of its whack you over the head satire, over-the-top comedy, and multitude of characters that we bounce around from in a slightly disjointed fashion, at the end of the day there's a damn fine monster movie in The Host, and it's just a damn good movie overall.",The Host
87,jluis1984,An excellent movie!,9,4 July 2007,"Since the late 90s, cinema of South Korea has been experiencing an exiting resurgence that seems to point out to a second ""Golden Age"" in the near future, as not only the production of films in the Asian country has increased enormously, it is also reaching worldwide audiences thanks to the high quality of their craftsmanship and the special sensibility of this new Korean style. Of course, the horror genre is not exempt of this resurgence, as modern South Korean horror films have had a notable evolution from having a marked influence of 90s Japanese horror films (""Ringu"" for example) to having a style and personality of their own, as movies like ""Janghwa, Hongryeon"" (""A Tale of Two Sisters"") prove. Director Joon-ho Bong's ""Gwoemul"" is another testament of that growth, as it takes the old sub-genre of ""monster films"" and gives it a very unique and fresh spin.""Gwoemul"" (literally ""Monster""), tells the story of the Parks, a very dysfunctional family of underachievers that is brought together by a strange tragedy that takes place in Han river. Park Gang-Du (Kang-ho Song) and his father Hie-bong (Hie-bong Byeon) are the owners of a little snack near the Han river, which is the source of income for them and Gang-Du's young daughter, Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko). One day, a large aquatic monster emerges from the river and begins to attack and eat the people near the shore. Without knowing this, Hyun-seo gets out of the snack bar, only to be dragged by the monster into the river as her father fails to save her. At the funeral, Gang-Du's siblings Nam-il (Hae-il Park) and Nam-Loo (Du-na Bae) show up to mourn their niece, but later that night, a phone call from Hyun-seo convinces the family that she is still alive. Now they only have to work together to save her.A mixture of horror, black comedy and sci-i, ""Gwoemul"" was written by director Joon-ho Bong with the collaboration of Chul-Hyun Baek and Won-jun Ha, whom imaginatively reinvent the often overlooked sub-genre of giant monster movies with truly remarkable results. Like classics such as ""King Kong"", ""Gojira"" and ""Them!"" did in the past, ""Gwoemul"" uses its monster to explore deeper themes beyond the movie's action scenes. One of these themes is definitely the family, as the story is basically about the attempt of this highly dysfunctional family to stay together, work together, and save one of its members. The development of the character's relationships is remarkable, and the writers succeed in making them realistic and human despite the fantasy of the plot. Toying with black comedy and horror, there's also a not so subtle jab at the inability of governments to solve problems.Director Joon-ho Bong makes everything come together with great skill, carefully toying with the genres without falling in cheap sentimentalism or plain silliness. It's hard to make a comedy about a tragedy (let alone one about a giant monster), but Joon-ho Bong succeeds in moving between genres with enough subtlety to give ""Gwoemul"" a heart that many films these days lack. However, what truly makes ""Gwoemul"" shine is probably the fact that Joon-ho Bong knows that while deep and a tad ambitious, his film is still a big monster movie at heart, and so he never betrays the genre with false pretensions. With Hyung-ku Kim's beautiful cinematography and the excellent visual effects by The Orphanage, Joon-ho Bong makes a series of action and horror scenes with one of the most formidable monsters that have graced the screen in the last years.However, not everything in ""Gwoemul"" is about the monster, as being a study abut family, the cast is about as important as any special effect in the film. As Gang-Du, Kang-ho Song is very effective, portraying with great talent the excessive humanity of this dimwitted but lovable man. The highlight of the film is definitely Hie-bong Byen, who plays the head of the Park family with great talent, adding a sense of dignity to his character and practically stealing every scene he is in. Hae-il Park plays Gang-Du brother Nam-il, and he is very good as the always complaining young man who is unable to find a job. As their sister Nam-Joo, Du-na Bae adds balance to the cast, although certainly her role (like Hae-il Park's) is not really big. Finally, Ah-sung Ko delivers what's probably the film's best performance after Hie-bong Byen's.It's really difficult to mix so many genres and succeed in the attempt, as it's quite easy to lose the focus and ultimately the point the movie is trying to make. Fortunately, Joon-ho Bong manages to come up victorious in this effort, and successfully makes everything work without many sacrifices (although that's doesn't mean the story is free of plot holes). However, it's easy to understand why those expecting a straightforward monster movie may feel a bit disenchanted, as the family drama that makes the heart of the film may feel out of place for those expecting nothing more than multiple scenes of man-eating monsters (although there's plenty of that too); and on the opposite side, those expecting a campy and lighthearted kind of comedy may find themselves confused by the dark nature of the film's humor. Anyways, to those willing to accept that monster movies can have a heart, ""Gwoemul"" will feel like a breath of fresh air for the horror genre. While the mishmash of genres may be confusing at first sight, ""Gwoemul"" is an enjoyable movie that once again proves that the future of horror is no longer in Japan, it's now in South Korea. 9/10",The Host
88,gregsrants,A real good monster film that will reinvigorate those fans of the genre,8,11 February 2007,"There isn't a child out there that hasn't gone through his or her 'monster' stage. It starts very young when stories about boogeymen or the monster under the bed terrifies us from sleeping without the comfort of your parents shared bed. Then, around six we become fascinated by creatures and we think we are old enough to see them in any movie or television program to which they appear. Sure, we still get scared but our insatiable thirst for frightening beasts keep us asking to extend our bedtime curfew and sneaking a peek at those channels we are instructed never to watch.This enthrallment continues with our maturity and by the time we reach our formidable teenage years, we are still attracted to the monster genre but now we are either using the media on dates to get laid or we are trying desperately to find that one film that brings us back to the Alien or the The Thing movies that made our skin crawl in our youth. Good luck ever finding a recurrence of this experience.So when I got my invitation for the Korean creature feature The Host I was excited yet I had my feelings grounded in reality. It had been a long time since I had been impressed from credits to credits with a film that included a human devouring monster. King Kong didn't provide that to me last year although the attempt was valiant. Aliens vs. Predator was a good romp but when compared to the films that originated the characters, well what's the expression  'it couldn't hold a candle in a fart factory'.It actually got depressing when I couldn't think of any way above average creature feature thrill ride in the past fifteen years. Not Godzilla, not The Relic, not Mimic, not Lake Placid. Oh boy.It might surprise you to know that events that occur in the opening scenes of The Host were actually based on truth. In January 2000, in a U.S. Military facility, hundreds of bottles of formaldehyde was disposed of illegally and ended up in the sewer systems in the center of Seoul. This being a monster film, I think you can guess that this is where the inspired by true events stops.The result of the formaldehyde poisoning is of a mutated fish the size of an RV that shows up in Seoul's Han River and beings to feast upon the recreational relaxing crowds gathered along the rivers' banks. Its first viewing (hanging from the Han River Bridge) and its subsequent rampage on the multitude that had amassed in curiosity was pure monster movie magic. Small relief that is to the Park family who has a small food stand on the adjoining park. With grandfather Hie-bong, son Gang-du and his daughter Hyun-seo all in attendance at the wrong place at the wrong time, we watch as the creature stomps, eats, chases and overwhelms its frightful audience eventually leading to the capture of the young Hyun-so.Whether Hyun-seo is dead or alive remains a small mystery that will challenge the Park family and lead to the major storyline that will fuel the film through its 119 minute running time. It's not the only plot line however and this is what separates The Host from most of the American type films of the same genre. Where generally in Westernized films representing creatures, there is just one linear storyline  that being to track and kill the creature while carnage and destruction on behalf of the beast keeps us entertained until the inevitable conclusion.But The Host has two interesting plots which get almost equal play time. There is the obvious track and hunt, but also the fear that the creature has released a virus on the Korean people that requires U.S. involvement in an effort to cure.Both stories directly impact the Park family that also includes Gang-du's brother and sister, Nam-il and Nam-joo. They have been placed under quarantine due to their proximity to the creature at the time of its first feeding, but they also are set on avenging the fate of Hyun-so and they plot to escape their quarantine captors in an attempt to determining the fate of their young family member.The Host then ends up being a thrill ride of adventure filled with a little bit of everything that we come to enjoy in these types of films. There is humor, a good story, some mystery as to the intentions of the beast and special effects that are top rate. In fact, the effects are so good (they were created by a partnership between the WETA Workshop who was responsible for The Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Orphanage which aided in the effects of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) that you find yourself overlooking the fact that the giant catfish looking monster is not as scary as it is fascinating and graceful in its movements. Whether the creature is swinging from the rafters underneath the Han River Bridge or gently laying his victims down in a sewer level that acts like his Tupperware container the effects are as polished as anything you will see in a Spielberg big budget extravaganza.All the above made The Host a fun adventure ride that reinvigorated my interest in the genre. Sure, the eventual fate of the creature is never in doubt (after all, The Host II has yet to be announced), but how we get to the concluding chapter was as entertaining voyage as I had taken in a film for quite some time. So it may not exactly be Gone With the Wind (Thank GOD!) but it should go down as one of the top-10 creature flicks of all time and that says a mouthful.",The Host
89,joebloggscity,A very good fun Monster movie,7,14 February 2007,"""The Host"" is a bit of a new direction for Korean released movies in the West. Following on from the success of the mix of psychological horror and action/revenge movies, this comes as a change. ""The Host"" is the age-old story of a monster gone lose in a suburban city (although more along the river front here), where our heroes have to stop it. In this case, it centres round a dysfunctional family who are chasing the monster to rescue their kidnapped daughter.One thing that is pleasantly surprising about this film is that the acting is top-notch! The different members of the family play off each other well, and gel well as a team (even when they are each other's throats). Another great point is that the story is a bit different to the standard monster movie. They don't try to out-do Godzilla in the size/power of the monster and they focus mostly on the story of the family. If anything, after King Kong and Godzilla, this is a kind of back to basics for a monster movie and all the better for it.This film once again proves that Korea is a power house in film making. Funny and humorous, dark, action packed and interesting, I would very much recommend this to anyone. Might scare children a bit at points, but if they can handle Jurassic Park then they can easily handle this.",The Host

91,oneloveall,Boring scare over-hyped for it's modest special effects,4,21 December 2006,"Overly long, misdirected fright flick pitting a hapless fool and his family against a gigantic underwater mutation still managed to cause a huge sensation in it's native South Korea, breaking records as one of the bigger spectacles produced by the country. I suppose living in South Korea and not being exposed to the spectrum of derivative monster movies would have to make The Host a more palatable experience but for anyone watching over in the states, they may find themselves subject to an underwhelming and tedious pace that drowns out any charm this movie ought to have. It is fairly certain the huge deal made for this generic genetic mutation lies in it's CGI strengths, something apparently outsourced and handled by some California effects company. While made on a laughable budget by our over-bloated standards, Host still benefits greatly from the competent rendering of this shallow creature hybrid that helps infuse the otherwise bland dramatic scenes with a dose of eye candy not seen in that kind of market. What works best are the brief interchanges pairing the ridiculously rendered creature with the scenic Han river where much of the film takes place. The fluidity of these scenes almost make the rest of the movie hard to understand, given the amount of care and precision put into balancing out this absurd looking monster with the naturalistic cinematography- a surprising level of technical superiority for the low funded affair that it was. Unfortunately the movie spends way too much time dragging from one scene to the next, misusing it's comedic appeal, all the while loosely anchored by a boring cast and dull lead, which will make the supposed-to-be-fun affair feel a lot longer then it has any right to.",The Host
92,Movi3DO,Good horror and satire,7,14 May 2021,"Americans love to dump chemicals into the sea.An early work from director Bong Joon-ho. A mutated monster captured a family's kid, and now they had to save her while escaping the government.Similar to Parasite, even though this movie was a horror, its main purpose was a social and political commentary on both the Korean people and American government. The first scene was pretty indicative of this. Also, there were some weird comedy moments that confused and caught me by surprise.The horror was pretty good. The monster, although it could be better, still look real enough to be scary. There were some intense moments where the camera angle enhanced the suspense. The last scene was pretty awesome.Although I didn't feel emotional, the characters were adequately developed, and some had social meanings to the South Korean society back then.Overall, a good horror and action with multiple satires and commentaries. 7.5/10.",The Host
93,DonFishies,"Satirical, dystopic and flawed all in one hell of a take on the monster movie",7,12 October 2007,"I cannot recall how I first heard about it, but I do remember that all I heard was praise for The Host. It sounded like an intriguing idea from what was written about it, but I was a bit sceptical about thinking of it on the same terms as something as masterful as Jaws. But what it lacks in comparison to the excellence of the Spielbergian classic, it makes up for in satire that American horror films seem to have forgotten.Without getting into excessive detail, The Host revolves around a mutated fish-like creature living in the waters in South Korea. After the creature attacks a nearby tourist spot, the government gets involved, quarantining those who came into contact with the creature, and alongside the United States, begin to try and destroy the monster and keep the peoples safe.Of course, this does not even begin to chisel into the subplot heavy storyline of the family the film centres on, but that ruins some of the fun and genuine terror the film builds. Right from the moment the creature first emerges, it is easy to spot that he is not just another man dressed up in mutated lizard suit. Every calculated move he makes, and every moment any frame lingers on him, is clearly where a comparison to Jaws emerged. No, there is none of the terrifically poignant moments of confusion over what the motives of the creature are, or mass evacuations of townspeople running away from an unknowing evil (instead we get people scrambling away from one of the creepiest special effects of recent memory), but the dystopic vision the film creates is more than enough to stay terrified of.The dystopia and the satire is what the film really relies on to give itself a kick. If this film is not speaking out to injustices of the past and of the continued present, then I do not know what is. In a way, it is a turn of the century redo of Godzilla, only a lot more stylish, emotional and suspenseful. It knows that it is making a statement about the current state of politics in Asia and in the Western hemisphere, and it is not afraid to associate itself with images on par with World War I and II, and even 9/11. It is inherently one very political allegory of a film, and it uses its notions of right and wrong to its best advantage from beginning to end. It hits hard, and it leaves a illustrious impact that cannot easily be forgotten. What also helps is how well done the cinematography and editing was. Invoking the same guerrilla style realism of the brilliant filmed Children of Men, The Host uses its visual to give the audience an almost completely ""right there"" style look at dealing with this monster, and trying to survive its attacks. Some of these visuals are simply out of this world.But this is also where it flops around like a fish out of water. Scenes play wonderfully in one instant, and then drag on for hours in the next. Many beg the question of why they are even there in the first place. I understand the pathos of the family being key, but did they really need to pad out this pathos for an extra thirty minutes? Jaws was by no means a shot through the heart of adrenaline at every waking moment, but it did not spend time just waddling along until the next scene. The Host on the other hand, feels like a ninety minute movie stuck in the body of a movie bordering on two hours. It just loses far too much steam in some cases that you wonder why you were so anxiety ridden only mere seconds before. If this movie is weak for any reason, it is because there is so much emphasis being dropped on these scenes filled to the brim with nothingness. I like poignant dialogue and magnificent scenery just as much as the next film aficionado, but the stuff here is almost useless in its careless design.The acting for the most part, is fairly well done. There is a great deal of focus on emotionally wrought and overrun characters, and when the scenes get particularly dramatic, the cast mostly delivers. At times, some do feel rather amateur and baffled, but those who are regular actor seem to have no problem grasping the ideas of the script and going with them.But the real star is the monster, who breathes life into a genre once completely owned by Godzilla. He is a truly terrifying monster, and the wonderful work put into making him actually alive is quite amazing. Even when he is running alongside real people, he looks, breathes and sounds like the real thing (had I ever seen a gigantic mutated fish). The terrific work put into the creation of this monster is blatant right from the start, and I was very glad to see it stay as consistent as it did in an otherwise cheaply made Korean film. The filmmakers know just what to use to make this monster accomplish the impossible, and as a result, have created a creature that will probably stay with many people for years to come.Yes, The Host does share quite a set of problems that should have been weighed out well before its release in North America. But on the same token, I think a lot of people are impressed with the progress that was made in creating this movie, and how brilliant looking the monster actually is. But the satire and dystopic nature the film paints out is more than reason enough to watch the movie.7.5/10.",The Host
94,gigan-92,Best Monster Film In Years,10,30 January 2011,"I just recently saw this film and it is definitely one of the best monster movies in recent years. In light of some of the dismal releases like the infamous American re-make of Godzilla to the intriguing yet lacking ""Cloverfield"", it's hard to find an genuine and generally well done monster film these days. There has been few monster films as excellent as this one, even fewer than blend humor in so well with the other aspects of this genre. In fact, not since the original Japanese cut of ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" has there been a film quite like this one. And coming from director Bong Joon-ho, this was really unexpected. It is great to see a foreign flick really stand out amongst he piles of rubbish, especially American rubbish. And the score by Lee Byung-woo is moving and really awesome. It keeps the mood of the film steady and never goes over board. The moments of silence are almost even better, which is a terrifying concept really.What I really underestimated was the quality of the story by Bong Joon-ho and Baek Chul-hyun, which had some of the most involving characters I'd seen in the monster genre. You will embrace these characters for who they are, and will enjoy every minute of their screen time. The performances were simply put awesome. Some may criticize the comedy, but in reality it adds to the humanity of these characters, so in the end you appreciate them a lot more. The monster itself, which I do not to give too much away about, has a very unique design and the gorgeous cinematography by Kim Hyung-goo really captures the action and story quite well on screen. And I don't think many may have noticed, but there's strong political messages subtly within the story as well, mostly America's military presence in Korea. Much akin to how director Ishiro Honda instilled political and social themes into many of his greatest sci-fi epics, such as the horror of the nuclear arms race in ""Gojira"", or the satire of commercialism and the business industry in ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"", or even the folly of man's greed and also the brutal indifference to the sufferings of one another we all impose in life in ""Mothra vs. Godzilla."" Like those films, ""The Host"" is bound to become a classic among the sci-fi genre if you ask me, and rightfully so.As for the DVD, its great and all, with mediocre dubbing just as you'll find on any Sony-Tristar Godzilla DVD release. Stick to the original Korean track.",The Host

96,raypdaley182,Weird,6,4 April 2007,"It may be weird but it's sure as heck entertaining. From the Korean film industry you have a good idea. What would happen if a monster lived in the Han River ( a bit like The Loch Ness Monster) and thus the idea for this film was born.All the locations are real, even the sewer isn't a set. That's a real sewer! The actors are very good, we're following the fortunes and misfortunes of the Park family. Gramps the alcoholic, Dad who runs a food stand, brother is a failed college graduate, sister is a world class archer and and grand daughter in school.Basically this film is a kidnap film where the grand daughter is taken by the monster and dad and the others have to overcome many trials to save her life.The effects for the creature were all done in the US and it looks pretty darn good.The story holds up well, the plot is fairly decent and all the actors are excellent.Don't worry about it being subtitled, it's still very easy to watch and highly enjoyable.",The Host
97,garethcrook,It starts well...,6,19 May 2020,"We start with pouring gallons of used formaldehyde into the Han River. This isn't going to end well. Yes I'm watching Korean cinema again and this one has a big water inhabiting monster. By now you'll have made the connection, it really doesn't take long. Polluted water = giant mutant creature. It is utterly bonkers, genuinely devastating in places and oddly amusing. Gang-du is not the sharpest tool in the box, eeking out a living with his father selling squid to tourists by the river and he gets a front row seat to the monster's first appearance. No teasing here, a glimpse of a tail, the suggestion of an eye. No, bang! 15 minutes in, MONSTER. Broad daylight, cards firmly on the table. Okay it's slightly hyper real CGI, but it looks good. Moves fast on four legs, big whippy tail, a mouth like predator and it eats people. People including Gand-du's daughter! Being eaten by this thing though doesn't always spell the end, mostly it does, but it does some rather disgusting looking regurgitating and Hyan-seo survives. Considering the genre we're in, there's very little grandstanding and what little there is, is easily diffused by the quirky comedy. It's more farce than anything else. So when Gang-du gets a call from his presumed dead daughter, it's seems perfectly acceptable and off we go on a rescue mission. Once Gang-du, his father, his bronze medal winning sister and unemployed college graduate brother have escaped the authorities in quarantine in slap-stick style, they head for the sewers on the hunt for Hyun-seo. She's captive in the monsters makeshift pantry of bodies, the only one alive until a new recruit drops in. A young boy, younger than her and the two school kids try to find a way out, whilst her family attempt to find her, via getting attacked by the monster, lobotomised and killed! Not all at once. In the midst of all this, the authorities are warning of a virus, one they can't actually find any evidence of, but are planning to eradicate with the release of a biowarfare nerve agent... see, bonkers. To be honest, as fun as it is, it really could've done with being half an hour shorter and just a little bit more focused. The ending is, well it's the stuff of Hollywood blockbusters, but without the budget. All in all it's pretty nonsensical and bloated, definitely a case of the chase being better than the catch. I did expect a little more, namely because it's directed by Bong Joon Ho, of Parasite fame and the lead here, is the same guy who played the father in the Oscar winner too. All I can say is, he's improved a lot in the last 14 years.",The Host
98,HEFILM,dull mid section muddled subplots and characters dull resolution,5,16 January 2007,"Know going in that the best monster scene is right up front in this movie. Like ""The Fugitive"" the idea is, knock them dead right away and let the rest of the movie coast.This one coasts more and more slowly. More and more characters come along and get in the way of, rather than propel, the action. Then the political intrigue sets in and the monster is far far away for too long for the movie to ever recover. The only really poor Digital stuff comes during the not very exciting climax sort of putting the movie's fire out and leaving a bad non fishy taste in the mouth.I guess the political stuff would be of interest in Korea as some of that is based in fact?!? But this is a fish monster movie and the opening American bashing set up is so good you don't need, or expect the whole movie to come crashing down. I didn't come to this movie to get ""The China Syndrome"" and those elements aren't too well done here anyway, aside from them being in the wrong movie. The Title, ""The Host"" is also a poor choice and has little to do with the film really.Okay, yeah we get it giant mutants have been out to get us and it's our fault since the Atomic Bomb monsters in the 1950's. And the best of those were more to the point and on point than this film is.Our sort of main family of losers also take up too much time bumming out in the mid section of the film hashing and rehashing things we got right from the start and where the ""F"" is the ""F-ing"" fish monster during all this time? And the family does some really dumb things that makes their plight worse and loses any sympathy you have for them. It goes beyond wanting them as underdogs to win to wanting to have some more active smarter people trying to save themselves.A monster movie, a great one, spends some time developing the monster and it's abilities this one pretty much sets all that up right away and then....Missed potential. The comedy relief is pretty funny but also pretty cartoonish--which is typical for that region.This seems like an impressive sized film from the way it starts, but the low budget shows again in the slow majority of the rest of the film. After setting up a large army presence the army then vanishes from the rest of the film. A potential riot seems to be of more interest to newscasts than a strange rampaging walking fish monster and these cost saving newscasts start to fill up the missing action elements of the film and the army is conspicuously absent from several scenes where they would naturally appear. An important parallel story line is lost and doesn't develop at all.Really by the end, sad to say, this is more like, than unlike, too many bad CG monster movies that clog up Sci Fi Channel. It does start out better which makes the fall seem all the more of a let down. So best thing is to forget the hype and then enjoy the first 20 minutes or so of this, overlong let down of a movie by the end.Monster looks like a cross between ""Blinky"" the three eyed fish on The Simpsons and ""The Relic."" Though this film is better than The Relic, it's not as good as Blinky.Expect less and you might enjoy this film more. Bear with the dullness that sadly sets in. if you can.",The Host
99,david-meldrum,More Than Your Average Monster Movie,8,3 November 2021,"The set-up for this makes it appear like a reasonably standard monster movie; in reality, it's anything but. There's good humour, genuine emotional weight and technical mastery here - and much for the mind to reflect on. For all its heightened sci-fi/horror and comedic moments, it takes place in a tangibly real world where people fall asleep at inopportune moments, trip over things and get confused in multi-story car parks. This means the emotional weight hits home when it needs to, reducing the distance between viewer and subject-matter. And there are big themes about science, the environment. Western hypocrisy and (in keeping with much of Bong Joon Ho's other work) a deep concern about economic injustice, debt and the chasm between rich and poor. The monster moves with an almost balletic grace at times also; though it's monstrous there's real beauty in it. All in all it makes for a stand-out in the genre, and a prescient sign of the director's later triumphs.",The Host

Now I love a decent two hour plus movie, but it has to have something going on interesting during some of the duller parts of the scripts. I would not have cut not a lot but probably 10-15 minutes worth and it would have been a better flick. Whoever decided to go over to the Best special effects companies (Oscar winning Weta was one) to do their flick and pay a little more to get it done Right, was/is the biggest reason why the film looks so good. Seriously the best script in the world that has a giant creature as the main character, and used special effects that suck (Ahem Sci-Fi channel movie quality I mean) no one would have watched it or enjoyed it as much. Now I liked the film quite a bit, but not nearly as much as so many others. The first hour in particular, (except for a few heart-pounding sequences) was really slow getting going. I also felt that we never really got much of a grasp or a good understanding of all the main characters. While in ""Alien"" we get to know all of the main characters quite well, and care about what happens to them. The one character we did get to know pretty well was the girls father, and it was written well, and he grew the most of the main characters. I liked this and maybe in subsequent viewings I will catch more and enjoy it even more. Overall the acting was top-notch in most parts, but if anyone watches this not in the native language of Korean, you will be sorry. The Dubbing, (at least the English dubbing) is absolutely atrocious, embarrassing, and will ruin the film. I don't know who does the dubbing, but it is just terrible! (Of course just about all of them are) This is a fun monster movie, but the monster unfortunately In my opinion is barely used and seems like a waste to not involve the creature a little more in movie. This is no Alien, but it is a valiant effort and will go down as a pretty solid monster movie.",The Host

Second half is just about repeating the same scenes, and hence drags.Talking of flaws .Everyone has to die unnecessary. The manner in which Hie-bong killed himself was stupid. All the members were running towards the monster in same direction, inviting their death. But somehow, they escaped death, police and everything successfully every time. One expects the father to die in one scene, but the scene ends there and he is shown alive few minutes after that.

105,Cinema_Fan,The alien from the deep: Be Afraid.,8,24 March 2007,"Formaldehyde is an extremely poisonous solution. Which can be found in vehicle exhaust fumes and tobacco smoke amongst others, over exposure to this chemical can trigger asthma and can fatality trigger cancer. It is in this chemical, and in vast quantities, that we see poured into the great Han River of South Korea (an event that actually happened at a US military base in central Seoul in the year 2000, and being an inspiration for Gwoemul) not by accident but with contempt, malice and total disregard for its consequence. So begins the colossal after affects' of the man-made atrocity and the birth of a new and deadly mutant creature that has grown to immense proportions and with its size has an equal if not larger appetite.Thirty-eight year old director Joon-ho Bong is representing the typical modern working class Asian family and its approach in the face of obscurity of combining both the fantasy of this mutant creature and the harsh realities' of their different backgrounds that do well to act as a metaphor for the social disorder that modern society has evolved into. Hence, at the beginning of Gwoemul we also see the suicide of an undistinguished and easily forgettable middle-class Mr. Yoon, possibly another victim of this social indifference, note he leaves his shoes at the rails of the bridge before jumping into the Han River, leaving one world to enter another.Gwoemul is a story of human resources pulling together at the time when all seems possibly lost, this Soul searching, this awakening of the human spirit and the passionate sacrifice that at a time of loss and suffering overcomes its tolerances and excepts the inevitable through the actions of bravery, strength and unity.The amphibious beast's terrifying demeanour is more than adequate to scare and release fear amongst the lowest order of the food chain, and set against the black comedy (similar to the Japanese movie Katakuri-ke no kôfuku concerning family bonds in the face of trouble and strife) that also makes up the Gwoemul DNA. Joon-ho Bong's strength is in his construction of both these assets, and not so much with comic relief but a showing of the flaws in human nature and the one direction that it has to undertake to redeem itself.The virus and its social, political and military reactions seen here in Gwoemul are of the same parallels of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic of 2002 and 2003 that caused more than seven hundred deaths and that originated in Asia, are obvious. As the unwitting, scared and bleating public are feed, via the multimedia and the military's physical presence an elaborate hoax to contain and control them is slowly unfolded and realised. Where as the SARS was real, this fictitious virus that the creature is host to and its dealings is beyond contempt for its handling of the City's own people. It is beyond this narrative that the Will to function on an independent level, against the confining authorities, takes over the story and injects Gwoemul with its heroes that are found in the most unsuspecting of places.This movie of morals, principles and the modern fragmented family is paced with enough action, suspense and monstrous fun and fright to keep the attention of all that view Gwoemul. It is also the work of cinematographer Hyung-Ku Kim that represents the darker side of the city's heart via its labyrinth of sewers and dark tunnels, both an eerie feeling of claustrophobic paranoia, haunting, and hunting, trepidation.Gwoemul fairs up well against movies of this genre, the difference being is that Gwoemul does it just a little bit differently, this movies creation is a one-off, a man-made disaster, and like Gwoemul itself is a pleasant breath of fresh air blown from the mystic East that is worthy of the respect of this genre and its fellow adversaries.",The Host

""The Host"" does a lot of things right and in retrospect, I can't find a single flaw with it. It contains just about everything to make it uniquely its own, as well as contain the fun of actually seeing a monster on screen and an over-emotional family caught in the middle. I also love that the film was in part inspired by an incident in 2000, in which a Korean mortician working for the U.S. military in Seoul dumped a large amount of formaldehyde down the drain. This has added some antagonism against the United States, but also portrayed the South Korean government as bureaucratic, inept and essentially uncaring. Neither of it is overwhelming in the production, and doesn't try to force a message or point a finger. It's a monster movie foremost, and an enjoyable one at that.I didn't see it until 2010, around the same time as viewing Park Chan Wook's ""Oldboy"" (2003). I personally think that ""Oldboy"", Takashi Miike's ""Audition"" (1999), & ""The Host"" were responsible for me gaining an interest in modern foreign films, and finding out that it was just the tip of these directors talents.Final Verdict: The monster is very much made up of CGI, and I can imagine how much a turn off that could be for some people. But they would be missing out on Bong Joon-ho's fantastic camera work and subtle comedy, that make creature features so popular to begin with. 7.5/10.",The Host
109,come2whereimfrom,The Host,6,17 November 2006,"Quite simply a big monster movie from Korea. It has been described by some as jaws meets Jurassic park and that is pretty accurate to be fair. It doesn't take long to set up the premise of the film as an army mortician pours dangerous chemicals down the drain and creates a kind of giant dogfish with an amazing array of teeth. From here on in its action all the way with all the added elements you would expect from any eastern horror film, slapstick, mythology and blood lots of blood. There are a few flourishes from the director using various tricks like slow motion etc but the real star is the beast as it swims, runs, jumps and eats its way around the riverside. I think that underneath the action there is a metaphor relating to the SARS virus but it so vague it's almost too easy to miss and the monster side distracts further. If you like you films a little off kilter with a pinch of fun to balance out the horror then this is the one for you, but if you are looking for the neatness and an ability to make sense of what you seen when you leave the cinema then I would save this one until it comes out on video. So an OK stab at the big monster genre but its not quite there as a whole, sadly",The Host
110,Eternality,"Bong's film is the contemporary answer to Ishiro Honda's Godzilla (1954), and George Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968).",8,11 September 2010,"Only Bong Joon-ho's third feature film after Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000), and Memories of Murder (2003), The Host broke new ground in Korean cinema midway through a phenomenal decade that showed the world that Korean filmmakers not only were the torchbearers of Asian cinema riding into the 21st century, but also had what it took to challenge the very best of films from the West.In the tradition of monster pictures, a sub-genre of horror, The Host oozes familiarity yet feels strange at the same time. Set in our day and age, the film is about a huge creature that surfaces out of Seoul's Han River to attack humans. A prologue sequence indirectly explains the origins of the massive grey blob that looks like a squid monster, which is the result of a mutation of a water organism caused by toxic chemicals released into the river by an American military base.Bong's film is the contemporary answer to Ishiro Honda's Godzilla (1954), and George Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968). A reactionary film to both, but not limited to, political and social issues, The Host makes use of the ""squid monster"" as an allegory of xenophobia, and more uncomfortably, as a symbolic representation of ""the ugly Man"", who is a thoughtless polluter, a greedy consumer, and a selfish individual. In one scene, the monster throws up and out comes the bones of human remains, a powerful image which puts picture to the words ""the ugly Man"".It all starts with the misappropriation of a man's action, which causes a reaction (that of the emergence of the monster), and consequently, leads to a series of actions and reactions, or in some instances, non-actions and non-reactions, that reveal the very nature of Man's behavior at the individual and societal level.For the latter, Bong portrays the Korean authorities as overly paranoid, and to a certain extent, schizophrenic. Worse, they seem to be ignorant of the plight of victims who are captured by the monster; instead they choose to isolate them for fear of contracting a potentially fatal virus (SARS anyone?). In a later scene, the US government intervenes and releases lethal fumes called ""Agent Yellow"" around the Han River to the chagrin of local protesters who stand united in chorus against its careless discharge.One of two victims who are still alive in the monster's lair, a big sewage construct, is the daughter of Gang-du (Song Kang-ho), the film's lead character. Gang-du has to save her daughter after an unexpected phone call by the latter convinces him that she is not dead. Bong paints the individuals in a different light; Gang-du and his remaining family must overcome their personal weaknesses to try to mount a rescue effort even as the authorities (and the monster) ""hunt"" them down.The Host is beautifully shot with a distinctive and composed visual style that Bong could call his own. His excellent sense of mise-en-scene might seem a trifle odd when combined with the somewhat intentional B-gradish monster effects, but the strangeness is more positive than not. The mix of horror and comedy allow the film to be taken less seriously, but at the expense of the viewer's ability to feel very strongly for any tragic development in the film.It may be Bong's most commercially successful film to date, but The Host is not his best work. Generally entertaining with some moments of genuine suspense, this monster flick remains to be one of the best modern examples of its sub-genre.SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",The Host

112,benoit-3,Makes all other creature features look like crap,10,30 October 2010,"There are many reasons for the film's success. It is imaginative and daring in its concept, actually basing its story on a real incident of formaldehyde poisoning caused by American military negligence. This aspect of the film makes it very political: the real villain here is not the monster, it's the American hubris and incompetence that created the monster and invented a virus scare to cover-up its idiocy.The viewer's interest is maintained throughout not only with stunningly integrated special effects but by the great humanity of the characters, even the secondary ones. These are presented to the audience in cursory but satisfying fashion, then elaborated. This is called character development and it is almost totally absent from dumbed-down mainstream American movies these days.The plot is also full of surprising twists which add to the complexity of the characters instead of subtracting from it. The ending is surprising, heroic and disquieting and a long ways away from Hollywood's traditional happy end.The whole thing is held together by technical brilliance in special effects, dialogue writing, photography, art direction, lighting, sets, acting, directing, visual imagination, suspenseful editing and a magnificent score that alternates between a Fellini slice-of-life score by Nino Rota and the romantic effulgence of Michel Legrand.In short, this film is so advanced it can probably never be topped by anything on this side of the Atlantic for a long time.",The Host

115,overseer-3,I Love The Host !!!,10,7 August 2010,"The Host is one of my favorite Korean movies. It has everything: suspense, energy, love, humor, pathos, political intrigue, and lots of unique imagination compared to your typical monster movie.An American scientist in a lab in Korea orders a Korean clerk to dispose of large quantities of formaldehyde in the Han River at Seoul (this at least was based on a true incident). A few weeks later two fishermen spot a strange amphibian creature in the water, pick it up, examine it, then let it go. Months later this creature has grown into an enormous man eating monster who attacks the people living and congregating near the Han River. He kidnaps a little girl and brings her to his lair in the sewers (the sewer scenes were actually filmed in real sewers and the cast all needed tetanus shots before they worked on those scenes). Her family have to fight city hall, the police, the medical profession to get their daughter back on their own.The acting was terrific in this film; it's a perfect cast. The music is fantastic and adds a lot of character to a film already brimming over with it. The film is now out on Blu-ray as well as DVD, with excellent English subtitles. Please do not watch the film with the English dub. Go to the menu set up and choose Korean language with English subs instead. Believe me you will enjoy the picture a whole lot more. I've never seen a film with a good dub yet; the lips are always out of sync with the voices, no matter how hard they try.

For example, low angles are used frequently to show who, or what, has control at any point; It's so incredibly uncomplicated and common yet so incredibly effective.The abundance of low angles also reinforces the idea of classism that Bong Joon Ho somehow hasn't worn out.From sewers head to foot an uncomfortable drone keeps you on your toes until each reveal, all as significant as the next.

The Host pays homage to B-movie plots that you see and gives them a big Hollywood style make over but unlike Hollywood which goes into lengthy topics and tries to give an explanation into things - The Host is such a simple movie to follow that even 5 five year could work it out, and the plot well....its a monster movie does it really matter. The acting was class not mention at times just so dame right funny at times with a few genuine moments that moved you . My only complaint was that I live in London and if something like that appeared in The River Thames the army would seal of everything and make sure that NOBODY manage to get in, how these lot managed to pull it of so easily is beyond me but for the sake of entertainment I was willing to let it go. To conclude The Host is probably the next best monster movie I have seen since the Hollywood version of Godzilla but having said that The Host is not nearly as toned down as Godzilla is...especially when you check out its rather horrid eating habits. Take it for what it is, jut leave your brain at the door and just escape of into it for a while. Nothing gained and nothing lost.

120,FairlyAnonymous,"And this is why people love ""The Host""",8,24 November 2012,"(First off watch the subbed version) The Host is a great movie for many reasons but to put it simply why everyone likes it: It's Unique. There really isn't another movie like The Host which is what makes it so entertaining and different from most monster movies. One of the most interesting things about the movie is that it is able to have comedic moments while still maintaining a sense of seriousness. The movie is genuinely funny (there are many moments where I burst out laughing) which is a rare thing because the movie keeps it all in a realistic sense.Just to clarify, this movie is a monster movie, but the plot is actually less focused on the monster and more on the people. This is odd because most monster movies focus on an original aspect of the monster or the action of the monster fighting people, but in this movie the central focus is on a father and his family trying to find his daughter who was taken by the monster. There is a lot of character development in this movie which is probably one of the reasons why this movie is so respected. Not only does the movie have a bit of character development but it also presses on several political issues involving America's stay in Korea, government cover-ups, pollution, changing generations in Korea, and some other obscure and obtuse ideas.One thing that I can truly respect this film for is that it feels very down to earth and casual. It's not overly dramatic (until the very last scene)and the characters interact realistically to each other. I just love how the monster is used more as a way to develop characters than it is to talk about a monster. But that's not to say that the monster isn't good...The monster in ""The Host"" is probably the main reason why you have heard about the movie. A lot of people have noted that there hasn't been a monster quite like the one in ""The Host"". The monster is on the smaller size (truck sized), it acts like a real animal, is clever, smart, agile, and ISN'T camera shy. The monster acts like a real-life animal that is hunting and when it finds a kill it swims off with it in a realistic manner and then eats a safe distance away. Another cool thing about the monster is that it is incredibly agile (which creates some very cool scenes... you'll have to see it for yourself) and it shows some signs of intelligence.Overall ""The Host"" is a very surprising Korean film. Nobody expected it to be amazing, which also ties in with its success. It has a lot of new ideas and hopefully there will some more Korean movies that appeal to foreign audiences as well as this movie. Definitely worth seeing!",The Host
121,kevinxirau,A boring flick with wasted monster talent.,3,12 May 2012,"To be quite honest, I actually expected more from this Korean monster movie and unfortunately paid the price. I wasted a few hours of my life watching this hoping to get some enjoyment out of it, which I was barely successful. What do I mean by this? Let's take a look.The story has a great deal of potential: a strange tadpole-like creature that's supposedly a host to a deadly virus wrecks havoc and kidnaps a little girl. The girl's loser father and the rest of the family set out to rescue her while avoiding capture by the military. Sounds like a cool and original story, however the execution of it was done poorly.There are just so many quiet scenes that just drag on for eternity and on top of that there are several strange moments. This just drains my overall interest and I almost fell asleep a couple of times because of it. I was just thinking ""WHEN WILL THIS END?"" I keeps me wondering when will the next bit of excitement will occur.The creature is one of the very few things that I like about this movie. It has some unique habits and characteristics that are explored throughout the film, plus it looks pretty cool. It is also fairly scary in terms of how it terrorizes people. Sadly, the scenes with the monster are the only good parts of the movie.With a poorly-executed plot, boring scenes that drag, and a seriously messed up ending, The Host is highly unlikely to entertain die-hard monster movie fans. Don't waste your time on this one unless you just want to see the monster scenes.",The Host
122,brianberta,A massive breath of fresh air,7,2 April 2016,"Many monster movies suffer from being over-the-top, repetitive, and cheesy nowadays. There are many more flaws to that genre, but here are the main ones I have with many of them. It's pretty hard for me to find good modern monster films. It is always refreshing to see a modern monster film which stands out amongst the rest of them as a result of doing a few things differently and better, making a highly effective piece of filmmaking. This is where ""The Host"" comes into place.After a fish gets mutated as a result of formaldehyde getting dumped into the ""Han River"", a slow-witted man named Park Gang-Du who operates a snack bar in a park does what he can to save his daughter, Hyun-seo, from its clutches after she is captured by it.One of the aspects to this film that works really well is the military aspect. This concept is most effective at the scene when Park Gang-du is captured by the military and is being tested on for a virus near the middle. If you look at the military's actions in the film from their side, their actions seem fair and understandable giving the circumstances. However, when you look at the film at the viewpoint of what Park Gang-du and his family have to go through, they look very threatening and evil. This works very good in the film because you can't decide whether to like or hate them. While most sci-fi monster movies view the military as a bunch of people who shoot at the main monster in the film with horrible aiming, this film makes you view them in a different and pretty original way.Another aspect which sets it apart from most other monster movies is that the film is never over-the-top with the scenes featuring the monster. While many monster movies kill off people in over-the-top and overly-exaggerated ways which sound like an immature child would come up with them, the monster in this film behaves how you'd expect a mutated fish to act if this was real life. It only kills for food, the kills never look exaggerated, and the film always keeps it so the monster behaves realistically. Also, this film continues to succeed in this aspect at the ending. One of the biggest clichés of any monster movie is to defeat the monster by blowing it up. I'm not going to spoil how they eventually kill the monster, but it doesn't give me an underwhelmed feeling.Also, some monster films have their monsters sound cheesy. Some of the cheesy monsters from films include ""2-Headed Shark Attack"", ""Sharktopus"", ""Sand Sharks"", and ""Sharknado"". Many monster films try to combine different animals with other animals or they try to give them unrealistic and stupid features. While the fish in this movie is giant and mutated, it never sounds as if a child would come up with it. It's pretty safe to say that this is much better than most other monster films produced in the last few decades.Another great thing about this film is that it has the guts to kill off main characters that you wouldn't expect to die. Although director Bong Joon-ho handles this concept much, much better in ""Snowpiercer"" (2013), this film shows it well too. While Snowpiercer handles this concept perfectly in my opinion, this one introduces it to us before Bong Joon-ho is able to perfect it later. In this film, the deaths are as unexpected as they are brief, and before we are able to fully realize what's about to happen, the characters bite the dust.My only major flaw with this movie lies with its final few minutes. Not the final fight scene before that one as that was greatly done, but the very final scene. Going back to Snowpiercer for a second, both of those films evoke somewhat similar moods with their ending. While Snowpiercer's ending may have worked since it handled ambiguity the right way, I don't think that this one works. My issue with it is that it doesn't show us enough of a conclusion for how all of the surviving characters turned out, what happened to them, and where they are living. It shows us a few minutes with a couple of them, and then it fades to black. I wished that the film was about 5-10 minutes longer. That would've been long enough to fill in the few remaining gaps. Since they were wanted by the military, I didn't know if the other people helping Park Gang-du got captured, if they were able to escape, or if something else happened to them. Also, I didn't know whether the military let them go or if they're still on the run. You could argue with this by saying that it's up to interpretation as to what happened to them, but the film didn't provide anything whatsoever for me to think of a logical explanation. However, this is a minor flaw, and I loved most other parts to this movie.In conclusion, I'm really glad that I checked this one out. I still prefer Snowpiercer greatly over this one, but this film contributes its own originality and shining factors to the table. The military aspect, the removal of the common and annoying over-the-top feeling in many monster films, and how it's fearless in killing off main characters makes it stand out amongst most monster films. Long story short, it is a gigantic breath of fresh air for modern monster films. I was not disappointed at all when I watched it, and it delivered on the praise it has received from critics and the audience. If you're one of the countless number of people who are sick to death with most repetitive and bland monster/horror films which are spit out way too often, try your absolute hardest to go out of your way to check this one out. Whatever you do, please do not dismiss it.",The Host
123,Ziya90,Need to be honest,4,26 January 2010,"I already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a satire, there were numerous political and social messages, the names make refer to some other names etc. It might be. I cannot realize such things (I don't want to do anyway) because I am not interested in, I am interested in 'cinema'. As for the movie itself, again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful. I could not see anything which we don't see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half. Yes, that scene says somethings about humanity, but it does not make the movie brilliant. The movie is entertaining (mildly) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more than that. As for the biggest flaw of the movie, it is visual effects. It was just shocking, I could not pull myself together for a while, because I had expected a realistic monster, because it is not one of the old Gojira movies, it was made in 2006, but it was not. It is like if you don't believe that there is a monster, you cannot care about. If you agree with me about this, I highly recommend you Cloverfield that is extremely realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an effort. Dramatically powerful critique. Some critics talk about it as if it is a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it is rather a drama than a thriller or action, but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. I don't want to compare The Host with other monster movies, but I try to mean that The Host does not do something that other monster movies do not do. By the way, may be some people call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes, I like Asian cinema too, but this is the fact.",The Host

A strange mixture of a monster film and a comedy that at times is so broad it's almost like Three Stooges kind of slapstick. Some of it is humorous, though not a whole lot, and while the monster at first is kind of fascinating, there isn't a moment of fear or suspense in this film primarily due to the constant lightheartedness and/or broadness in performances in nearly every situation presented.

Young couples lay together on blankets, friends toss a Frisbee - it's just about perfect... except for the giant creature hanging from the bridge.Parkgoers quickly gather to gape at the mysterious something. They ooh and aah when the great beast slides into to water and eases its way over to the shallows, idling just beneath the surface. No one senses any cause for alarm. They lean closer and toss snacks into the river, as if it's a cute family of ducks.But ducks don't have teeth like this thing.The crowd erupts into panic as the monster reveals its lethal force and ravenous appetite. Among the crowd scurrying for their lives are an old food shack owner, his young granddaughter, and her dad. The dad displays his bravery by facing the monster, but he also displays also his imperfections by... well, I won't spoil that part.Director and writer Bong Joon Ho cleverly details the family's dysfunction through subtle dialogue before the monster chase and in the aftermath. This family is a ragtag group without much clue about what to do, but they are nevertheless relatable and easy to root for.Though the horror aspect is feature most prominently, the film contains layers beneath the surface for those interested in further examination. Bong Joon Ho manages to weave together elements of a family comedy, social satire, environmental conservation, and of course, a monster horror movie.This is unequivocally Bong's movie. He expertly directs chase scenes with thrilling camera movements and engrossing framing choices that make you lean forward in your seat with excitement while you also partially cover your eyes in fear.

126,Chance2000esl,A Spielberg Styled 'Family' Horror Film!,8,1 June 2008,"This is not a ""Monster on the Rampage"" monster film, but is squarely in the mode of Steven Spielberg's focus on family-in-peril / search for family themes that are found in virtually all of the science-fiction films Spielberg has written or produced, from 'Jaws' (1975) up to his masterpiece 'War of the Worlds' (2005), both of which are highly suggested by this film.It's the story of a three generation Korean family and how they 'grow up' and adapt to a severe crisis. The crisis happens to be a giant fish-frog type monster (a product of river pollution, which lives in the Han River and its sewers) which snatches the family's youngest grandchild.This is not a kiddie film, but one that can appeal to everyone, because the focus is squarely on the individual family members and how they adapt to the crisis. As such, it may seem boring to Monster Fans, but so what. This is a well made film. In the amazing beginning, we are introduced to the hardworking grandfather, his two sons and daughter, and his granddaughter. The father is a lazy dead beat dad, the other brother an alcoholic, and the daughter a bow and arrow Olympian who chokes up and loses the gold. Then, the monster, huge and really a gross out, attacks the river bank and starts eating people and snatching the granddaughter, before leaping, frog like, back into the river. Wow! What a beginning! Others may become disappointed that the movie is not totally played for monster scares, but instead focuses on the family members and their quest to recover the granddaughter. This comprises most of the film, but if you just go with it, you'll enjoy it; especially watching it the second time, knowing how carefully this film has been constructed.I give it an 8.Humorous note: For fun, turn on both the English dubbing and the English subtitles.

128,freaky_dave,The first Asian Giant Monster movie in a long time is a success,7,31 July 2007,"The Host is a good step in the right direction for an Asian film about a giant monster since maybe Godzilla. Sure there are flaws with the film and I will mention them, but overall this was a pretty good film and one I recommend.The movie starts off with an American who orders his Asian counterpart to dump bottles of Formaldahyde down the sink and get rid of the bottles because they are dusty. The drainage of course leads to the Han River, but the American doesn't care. When the Asian guy tries to explain what might happen, the American wants to hear none of it and tells him again to get rid of the toxic chemicals. The Asian man does as he is told, and we get a long scene of every single bottle that has been dumped and realize that this film is much more than just a simple story about a giant monster running amok.Cut to a few years later where we see two guys fishing on the Han River. They discover a tiny mutant fish, capture it in a coffee cup, but it bites one of them who reaches in to touch it and escapes to swim away from them, leaving them to wonder what it could possibly be.Now here we are a few years after that event, and we are finally introduced to our four main stars who operate a small food store which sits on the shores of the Han River. They are a quirky bunch an immediately gain my interest. We have Hie-Bong (Hie-Bong Byeon) who is the widowed father of this dysfunctional family. He takes pride in his work and also in keeping his family together no matter how hard it may sometimes be. It is he who owns the store. His oldest son works with him in keeping the store operational, but has a tendency of falling asleep at the weirdest times. This would be Gang-Du (Kang-ho Song), and he would also be the father of Hyun Seo (Ah-sung Ko) who is still in high school. Kang-Du seems to be a hopeless case and loser. He is despised openly by younger brother Nam-il (Hae-il Park) who is a college graduate but cannot find a job. Nam-il also has a tendency to drink a lot. Finally the fourth member of this misfit family would be Nam-Joo (Du-na Bae), the only daughter of Hie-Bong and sister to both brothers. She is an Olympic medal Archer but has a tendency of choking when it counts most.Not long after this introduction, something is seen hanging from a bridge over the waters of the Han River. People walk towards the shore as the thing suddenly plunges into the water. Not long after in one of the best scenes, but not the only one, the creature emerges from the depths and starts munching down on onlookers who are suddenly running in terror to get away from the hungry beast. In the mêlée, Hyun-seo is snatched up by the monster as it dives back into the water's depths as Gang Du watches helplessly.Hours later, and suddenly the Korean Government, who believes that the creature is the host of some unidentified virus, is on the scene. Believing that everybody on the shore when the monster attacked is infected, they quarantine everybody. This includes our family of lovable misfits who get a call from Hyun-seo days later who tells them she is alive. Soon the family is escaping from quarantine to go recover Hyun-seo from the monster's clutches. That is the plot, and it is a plot that makes a political statement as well as creating a monster in order to build the real story around one family.The special effects were incredible. When you see the monster, you see all of it and in day-light as well as night-light. You also see it swinging from bridges like a gymnast. It is an incredible creation which never looks or feels like CGI even though it is.The performances by the four family members were incredible. You see their pain, anger, and resentment as well as their sadness. Their performances stand out the most, but other performances by minor characters which include two homeless brothers and a homeless man are just as strong. I really loved these characters for some reason and could not get them out of my mind for days.Now for the weaker points of the film and why it did not get a perfect grade or near perfect grade. The dialoque for the first hour was sort of choppy, and the story a little all over the place. There were also some scenes, including a funeral scene where people are grieving over their losses, that went on too long and well over the top. The movie also contained some comedic scenes that didn't work, but their were others that did work.The anti-American propaganda did not bother me, and when I found out that this story was based on a real event involving an American who ordered his Asian counter-part to dump toxic chemicals down the drain, I was not surprised. Of course in real life there was no mutated monster that ate people. Well none that we know of anyway.Overall this movie was very effective and one I bought and watched twice to get a better understanding of the story. The characters were incredibly well cast in their roles, and the special effects were really amazing. The story could've been somewhat better as it tended to flounder somewhat in the middle at times, but it really picked up towards the end, leading to a somewhat haunting ending. Good movie.",The Host
129,ozjeppe,Only partially successful re-hash of old time giant monster flicks.,5,19 February 2009,"Toxic drain dump in Seoul creates huge aquatic river monster that wrecks havoc on the city. A teen girl is snatched away and her family joins forces to track the beast down... and dodge fishy government officials along the way.Bringing its cat (well, monster) out of the bag so early on as here and in full flesh, is always risky and works only intermittently in this modern re-hash of - and homage to - old time giant monster flicks. Fairly well made and colorfully entertaining with quite an impressive monster, but wavers in tone too often in its human dramatic approach to become really successful. And it should have used its dark sewer-possibilities more to be convincingly scary. As often comes with the territory, a bit of environmental/government cover-up criticism is also in place. 5 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",The Host
130,helmutty,I am the host for now.,7,6 February 2007,"Wow! It was great! It is the best monster movie ever. To say the truth, I hate monster movies, they are boring. But for this one, wow, it is simple but I had so much fun. For those who don't know the story, it is about a dumbass father saw the monster and made a dash to safe his daughter and ""oh no!"" the dumbass grabbed the wrong person. Then later in the middle of the night, he received a call from his own daughter telling him that she is alive but is trapped. With determination and with his family, the dumbass father tried all means to save her. Simple but fun. In addition, there are some funny moments but the scenes are not shown clearly, that means the scenes are not making you laugh but smile or make the movie less serious.The monster which I was surprised by its size can devour people up in a minute. With the light music, the story builds the suspense, you can never know whether a family member will die while saving her. It is great. You should see this and compare with the other monster movies. Which is the best?",The Host
131,polsixe,Creature from the Han River,7,26 December 2006,"This is a good twist on the monster movie, not spoiling anything by saying the monster is well done FX/CGI and not your usual TRex-type carnosaur. The central family is a dysfunctional lot, a none too bright adult group on a desperate quest. All seem to represent a particular type of Korean: the bitter disaffected college grad, the not quite perfect archer, a genial patriarch, and the hero, a strong, stubborn brave fool. Oh, and they drink and bicker like Irishmen. The ""virus"" subplot does fit and is a clever method to show how the US and international (WHO here as a analogy for the IMF world bank) readily step in and control Korean affairs. Some laugh out loud humour and a not quite happy ending make for an entertaining thoughtful flick. Unlikely to get much play in the US, maybe some open minded blue-staters?",The Host
132,lagriff05,High-octane Korean thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat,8,19 August 2007,"Ah, monster movies. This is The Host, and it's probably one of the best movies to come out last year. While the story behind it isn't the most innovative, it's still very entertaining, and I dare a fan of high-octane modern horror/thrillers not to sink their teeth into this. It's two hours long, and feels a lot longer actually, but every second is packed to the brim with excellent, chilling visuals, a healthy, deep sense of adventure, and sprinkled lightly with some loopy midway carnival music at some points for extra effect (the soundtrack is brilliant!). The characters are obviously not the most fleshed out, this being a monster movie, but the acting is generally pretty good, and the characters enjoyable to watch, despite a few sticky moments (the crying scene at the very beginning of the movie was extremely overdone). Directing is very well done; crystal clear and polished, showcasing the best Asian horror has to offer.I did find it quite interesting how the monster is revealed in the beginning of the movie in it's entirety, not hidden by shadows or water or anything of the sort. I'm no monster movie connoisseur, but in most of the ones I've seen (Jaws, Creep, etc), the monster is usually kept unseen for a good portion of the movie, to build suspense and terror. Not here. ""The Host"" is openly revealed to the world, without a grand opening of the curtain or a suspenseful unmasking, and while it seems odd at first, the movie is structured to the point where this doesn't matter. It's just an interesting curiosity.While The Host isn't fully realized in every area (the ending is slightly lacking, and a few characters were definitely not given the proper treatment they needed), and while it's definitely not perfect, it's an extremely entertaining, thrilling, monster movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat for a full 2 hours. Highly recommended.",The Host
133,chelano,A...strange creature,6,4 November 2010,"A very interesting film by Jonn-ho Bong. It is basically about a mutated creature that kills people. I am not ruining anything here because within ten minutes the creature it revealed. As for what the creature is, I have no idea. Someones warped mind made up this thing and I enjoyed it. Kang-ho Song is the lead. A bum type lazy father who just helps his father run a small food shop. His father is played by Hie-bong Byeon who did a decent job. Kang-ho Song has a daughter played by Ah-sung Ko who gets captured by this creature and with the help of his brother, sister and father, he finally grows up and tries to get her back. There were parts of the film that were somewhat slow, but other parts did make up for it. The CG was good enough to make you think that the creature was really running around and killing people. The film is called The Host for a reason. The government thinks that a virus made this monster and anyone who came in contact with it, should be dealt with. So you have this creature running around and the government going crazy and the people going crazy thinking they have a virus. This film combines drama with comedy and then adds a dash of the scary. So overall, it was not the best film in the world, but it was fun to watch. I will say there are a couple scenes that stick out that I really enjoyed and hopefully you will too.",The Host
134,skymovies,What would happen if an American Werewolf ate a Clockwork Orange?,6,8 November 2006,"From the depths of Korean cinema comes a freakish hybrid of Godzilla-style mayhem, overwrought drama, conspiracy theory, comedy and sentimentality. Bong Joon-Ho's monster mash is nothing if not original.An ordinary day on the banks of Seoul's Han River livens up considerably when a cross between a giant mudskipper and HR Giger's Alien charges into the gathered crowd. Amidst all the screaming, squishing and chomping, convenience store dullard Gang-du sees the toxic tadpole make off with his daughter Hyun-seo (the talented Ko Ah-sung).The military rounds up everyone in the vicinity, saying that the creature is the host of a deadly virus. Gang-du and his loose-knit family (dad, brother, archery-ace sister) are in the throes of a public display of grief when they receive a faint call from Hyun-seo's phone. She's alive... albeit stuck in the beast's human meat store. They duly give the authorities the slip and race to the girl's rescue.Unconventional is not the word. Bong's movie changes tone between (and sometimes within) every scene. One minute we're deep in splattery slapstick, the next we're having a Kubrickian nightmare. Strangely, the people who wouldn't accept this from a Hollywood production are often first in line to lap up the same nonsense when it's imported from the Far East.Uniqueness is The Host's strong point. Editing isn't. Bong allows too many scenes to stretch beyond their natural end point and has a weakness for slo-mo which slows everything down, especially during the second half.It's mad as a box of frogs but inside this bloated beast is a much leaner, sharper, nastier monster squealing to get out.",The Host
135,tom_koopa,"A very good movie, with a very cool monster",8,22 June 2009,"Gwoemul, also known as 'the Host' is a very good horror movie. One of the better ones I have seen in a long time.Formaldehyde is dumped into the river and mutates the local fish (I think) into a large, carnivorous monster. It's hard to describe exactly what it is. It has some features of a fish, a tadpole and a.. bird.Just watch the movie and you can be the judge...Back to the story: the creature comes to shore and goes on a rampage. It also abducts a small girl and takes her back to his lair. The father of the girl, and three other family members, start looking for her immediately. But the army is closing the area down, so it will not be without difficulty...This movie has a really good, sometimes deep storyline. The characters have a background, and it really adds to the movie. There's good chemistry between them too, so the performances all look really believable.There is some humor in this movie, but not much. This really was intended to be a scary movie, which it is at times.The effects on the creature are really well done. Very creative design too. So two thumbs up for the designers and CGI animators.The music is also very moving. A beautiful score makes this movie even more appealing.I highly recommend Gwoemul (or The Host) to any fan of monster and/or horror movies.8 out of 10 stars.",The Host
136,schroederagustavo,"Nice blend of drama, comedy, horror and SCHLOCK!",8,27 March 2020,"I heard about The Host as soon as I finished watching Parasite, and since I really liked that movie, I was naturally very eager to watch this one. And I literally had no idea what it was about, which I think is the best way to watch this movie, and probably any movie for that matter.The opening of The Host is something that could have very well come out of a cheesy Twilight Zone episode. I loved it. In my opinion, the opening was very good, the film kept me pretty engaged. There's a great shot of the daughter character getting up in slow motion, while the creature creeps up behind her. I loved the creature design as well, which also seems like something out of a 1950's horror movie. The CGI for the creature is not the best in the world, however I think that it actually works in the movie's favour, because it's like it's a 1950's monster movie inside a really good Boon Joon Ho film, it's a really weird, but also pretty cool blend.And I like that the movie isn't 100% a monster horror film. There are so many elements in the film, whether it's family themes, overcoming adversity, becoming an adult (both for the dad and for the daughter character), stepping up to the call to adventure, comedy, etc. It's a lot, and oftentimes a bit too much, to be completely honest. Like I said, the opening is really good, I though the second part of the film was very interesting like the whole film, unlike anything I had ever seen before really in the way it was told. It jumps between stuff with the creature, the daughter, the family and then they get separated and so it's more storylines. This is where I believe the movie is at its weakest. It's a lot of things going on and doesn't feel really focused, in my opinion. However, I will say that I was impressed with the final 30 minutes of the film or so. This is a STRONG ending, and it's because all of the pieces that were together in the opening of the film come together again for an outstanding climax.In the end, I really enjoyed The Host. I don't think it was perfect, but if I had to describe it really quick, I guess it would be something like the title of this review. It's a really good ""director"" film, a really good ""cinematography"" film and also some great performances. But Boon Joon Ho doesn't shy away from some good old schlock, which is really appreciated. And his voice as a director really shines through. Would definitely watch sometime again on Netflix.",The Host
137,timmy_501,Artistically rendered monster movie with a message,8,11 August 2009,"Joon-ho Bong is exactly the kind of director we need more of. Here's a director with a keen, distinctive visual style who cares about plot and characters. Most directors who display a similar mastery of the medium make slow paced, heavy films that are more about how things happen and the attitudes of the people that experience them than what actually happens. While these films often present a welcome alternative to brain dead action films it seems that there are too few films which try to find a middle ground between those two extremes. Bong has found that middle ground and the result represents the best of both worlds. With his 2003 film Memories of Murder Bong reinvigorated the police procedural and breathed new life into one of the most hackneyed of genres. In 2006 he turned his attention to the monster movie and The Host became the biggest box office hit of all time in his native South Korea.Unlike many blockbusters, The Host is a film which deserves its success. Although Bong shows his creature frequently and in detail he always manages to keep the focus on the human characters. The main character of the film is a slacker doofus who is unlucky enough to be in the path of the rampaging creature the first time it emerges from the sea and this event ends up shaping his destiny as he fights back against the creature and gets its viral blood on him and a few minutes later it attacks his daughter. Along with his sister, brother, and father he is then drawn into the government's rather ineffectual efforts to quarantine everyone who has had contact with the creature as they are sure it's the host of some terrible new disease.Like Godzilla before it The Host creature exists at least in part due to mankind's influence on the environment. Just as the former creature was enhanced by nuclear radiation the latter has his origins in river pollution. The Host is more obviously critical of mankind's carelessness, however, as we are shown a gutless Korean scientist agreeing to pour dangerous chemicals into a drain in order to please his American boss. This act of pollution is based on a real life incident which shows that the problems faced by developing countries like South Korea are often caused by both domestic and international elements. The continued meddling of foreign powers and the mindblowing incompetence of South Korean government agencies puts the individuals caught in the middle into an increasingly dire situation.The Host isn't quite as well made as Memories of Murder but like that film it takes an approach that makes it feel fresh even if it is undoubtedly a genre work. It also has a bit more of a ""B Movie"" tone albeit not nearly as much as one might expect based on the trailer and other publicity. If these two films are any indication Bong should be a major talent for many years to come.",The Host
138,McQualude,Justifyably critical of government but not anti-American.,6,10 February 2008,"The Host is your basic monster movie that is not about the monster, as given away somewhat by the title. The beginning of the movie is based on real life events which are explained in the movie's trivia section at IMDb. The movie quickly takes off like a roller coaster, some of the best monster movie action since the Godzilla movies earlier this decade. Eventually things settle into a predictable middle of the movie storyline that is actually very interesting and kept me engaged. Unfortunately, Joon-ho Bong seemed to forget he was making a monster movie or perhaps used up most of his budget in the beginning of the movie and takes too long getting back to sweet crashing action that we really want in our monster films. Bong does make some valid criticisms at both the American and South Korean governments that left some people feeling the film was anti-American but I didn't get that impression. I did, however; come away feeling like I had been beat over the head with idealistic demagoguery. The ending of the movie is quite good, if even a little corny but Gwoemul is worth watching, it just may not be worth watching over and over.",The Host
139,jasminn_tan,Disappointing Ending,6,15 February 2020,"It's a good monster movie because it shows the different strengths and weaknesses of each character and the cinematography is pretty good too, not including the CGI and VFX of the mutated fish monster. However, I'm really disappointed at how the movie ended. After everything they did, his daughter still ended up being dead. Is it a realistic ending? I don't know, because the little boy that she saved ended up surviving. It's just so unfair to me that she didn't get to live too.",The Host

If I were an American I'd be kinda peed-off to find out that The Host was (in part) an angry statement from Koreans about the US Military being in their country.This film's anti-American message was partly inspired by an actual incident from way back in 2000 where a Korean mortician (working for the US Military in Seoul) was instructed to dump a large amount of formaldehyde down the drain.The 5-star rating that I gave The Host rests solely on the strength of the fantastic mutant monster and its ferocious appetite, and for nothing else.

141,imagiking,Gwoemul: A Stunning Piece of Cinema,8,26 February 2010,"I'm a man eager to watch any film I come across that looks interesting, particularly when it's not a mainstream film. You just know your chances are better. Gwoemul is such a film, and one which I managed to get a hold of on DVD. Its premise seemed interesting, and my curiosity was aroused by the description ""dark and offbeat humour synonymous with Korean cinema"".The interesting premise: Gang-Du, a lazy and slovenly fellow, works in his father's snack shop and tends to his daughter, caring for her since her mother ran off. He and his family are forced to track her down when a strange mutant creature from the Han river captures her. Simple, effective, entertaining.The film opens with a short few scenes, immediately identifying our creature's origins and giving us the first of a series of finger- pointings which forms a backbone of political metaphor throughout the plot. Our introduction to the creature's dangers coincides with our introduction to the Park family and the beginning of the quest to rescue the daughter, Hyun-Seo. Indeed the most striking thing we see early on in the film is this famous dark humour which drew me to it. There is a degree of absurdity in the funeral scene which has us laughing whilst simultaneously fully believing in this family's loss. The laughs run through the film, working perfectly at every instance and creating one of the more successful understandings of comic relief seen in quite some time. The dysfunction of the family and each character's oddities come to wonderful fruition, keeping us chuckling appropriately amid the scenes of increasing desperation. At no stage is the atmosphere of danger and drama put aside in favour of the funny factor, indeed the film blends the genres in one of the most effortless and simplistic ways ever seen on screen. By the film's fittingly dark and brilliant climax, every emotion has been experienced and is re-explored in a denouement worthy of unending praise.Deconstructing genres and recombining them in a way which makes it seem easy, Gwoemul is a film which combines an important political comment with a thrilling, hilarious and entertaining movie. The end result is a stunning piece of cinema which I would gladly watch again and again.",The Host

This isn't a normal creature movie, where you have a monster chasing the people and finally ending up dead. The movie explains a tragedy in the family caused by this creature. Kudos to the director for having given a sugar-coated version of this tragedy. There are lot of funny scenes in this movie that rejoice the audience. It is quite normal to expect a high grade movie from Joon Bong as I'd already seen 'Memories of Murder'. As you may see from the movie genre, it is Action- fantasy-Sci fi - comedy etc. I believe that too many genre for this movie has indeed spoiled its true essence.",The Host

Enter the Korean gem ""The Host."" There are problems, sure, but ""The Host"" manages to be scary, funny, sweet, pro-family, anti-US, anti-Korean, pro-environmental, and anti-sea monster (although trying to give them the benefit of the doubt).

144,jamhorner,A Host for all Parties,8,2 February 2008,"I always love Japanese horror movies, the reason being is because they are always one step ahead of us when it comes down to character analysis, real horror, clique situations and moral family values. When it comes to The Host, we see many of this stuff, but we also see that they have added in American influence to the mix. The story follows a family and their emotional struggle to survive when a monster attacks the city, after kidnapping their younger daughter. What makes this movie work so efficiently is the great acting, the family situations that they experience, the subtle comedy and the American influence. The horror itself was limited, though it was nonetheless a very good addition to the Japanese horror lineup. However, this movie came out in 2007 and it is not a rip-off, sequel, prequel or homage to Cloverfield as many of the online fans have thought.First off is the outstanding acting. The notable acting came from the father character, whose performance was very brilliant and emotional, the big brother character, who may seem dumb but his performance was very great and humorous, and lastly the suave brother, who may have been a bit too harsh and uncontrollable, but very good. Other great supporting casts came from the kidnapped daughter and the archer sister. There was also an okay small role for the homeless brothers. The only problem with this great analysis of the characters was that it took up most of the movie; I wanted to see a bit more monster attacks rather than character balance. Though, I enjoyed the acting and it really brought some emotional tension and heartbreaking scenes that this movie couldn't have done without.I enjoyed the fact that they touched based on. There were some great values on issues like ""taking over the family business,"" the responsibility that the big brother has over his younger sister and his ascension into becoming a man of responsibility and trust. I enjoyed the scene in which the grandpa gave his lecture as to why the other brother is ""slow,"" which demonstrates the perfect example of respecting your family. There was that heartbreaking scene, which was oddly funny too, on the morning wall that really gave an impact on me. There are just so many great examples of family and moral values that are demonstrated through this movie.There are also some great comedy scenes that almost felt like they didn't even belong there. Some of them were average day things like slipping or tripping and then making it seem like you did nothing, giving your dad the empty gun to shoot the monster, hysterically crying then falling down and causing a chain reaction, not watching to see if you burnt your food and falling asleep on the job. Just the mundane things that this movie pokes fun at and it's ultimate effect on the horrific outcomes. There were points in this movie where I did laugh, mostly at the big brother and the father characters. The humor seems to be there to lighten up the mood when things turn grim or to give otherwise serious people a funny side to them, rather than keeping them their boring stereotypical monotone personalities. This movie utilizes humor to show how human some of the strictest people are.The scars in this movie were not at its prime, which is why this Japanese horror flick seems odd when comparing it to other notable horror movies from this part of the world. When the monster does come and the girl is in focus and the monster is in the back charging her was scary, but some other things like the overall monster attack wasn't all that scary. Though, the sewer trench that it lives in is pretty creepy, especially when it has dead bodies lying all over and bones. I didn't jump as much as I thought I would, nor did I get the uneasy feeling that something is very disturbing. The scars seemed more Americanized than actual Japanese style of horror, but I'm not complaining, I enjoyed the new outlook on horror that the Asian community is testing.Overall, we can see that through this movie there is a great balance of satirical and tongue-in-cheek humor as well as some really good acting, ultimately giving the impression that this movie was heavily influenced by America's monster movie. I enjoyed this movie a lot and it is one of my favorite Japanese horror/monster movies and one of the best foreign films of the year. I would recommend this movie to those who do enjoy Asian horror, foreign horror flicks as well as those who enjoy a good monster movie. However, to those who do not enjoy comedy-horror or noticeable voice dubbing, then you may want to stay away from this movie. I enjoyed it, and I sincerely hope you will too.",The Host

The monster is great and there are many good moments - but tonally it's all over the place. There was a hint in the fact that iTunes categorises it as a ""comedy"" - which I found to be far from true. There are some scary moments, some attempted and actual poignancy, but the soundtrack in particular doesn't help at all, in my view.

147,vovazhd,Great monster movie plagued by inconsistencies,7,1 November 2007,"The Host is a Korean monster movie about a creature that is spawned from pollution in the Han River. It causes mayhem around the local community and forces the government to quarantine the area. From there the focus is on a small family caught in the middle. The story is typical of those horror B-movies, but ends up packing much more punch. There are elements of comedy (I laughed out loud numerous times) and drama (the conclusion especially). I found the horror aspect to be really weak; the monster's animation is laughable and there aren't any really scary situations.The acting was fine and the dialog produced mixed results (but maybe thats just from translation). Gang-du makes a charismatic main character, while the rest of the family is easy to relate to. One of the high points is that the film creates an absorbing environment. The quarantine zone is a great background for the monster. The special effects weren't too good... the monster looked really fake and acted strangely. Plus, there are so many illogical aspects to the monster and people's reaction. The camera-work and cinematography is generally good, and even excels in a few of the action sequences. The music fits right in.The largest flaw of the film is the broken plot structure. There are numerous inconsistencies and plot holes. While it doesn't wreck the experience, it is distracting. If nothing else, that is why I can't give the movie a higher score. Even so, this is among the better monster movies around. Although it lacks horror, it makes up for it in other categories.",The Host
148,Criticalstaff,Korean Black Mirror: Han River special,5,5 August 2020,"So I am watching the Host only because of Bong Joon-Ho. The movie establishes its central characters and then veers rapidly into monster movie territory. Then, in between the wild tonal shifts from comedy to deep dark horror I start to see a pattern emerge from the movie. The plot does not matter, the characters do not matter, but every once in a while we get an emotional bait-and-switch.At first, you barely notice it because the movie is weird, especially for someone ignorant of Korean culture, such as me. But then, it happens twice, then a third time. Then it grows exponentially. The last sequence is a tsunami of switcharoos, where the movie establishes for a thing to happen only to have something completely else happen. Frankly, at that point I did not care enough for the movie to feel anything. I felt numbed.The movie is weird in a good sense. It is quirky, it is odd, and it is refreshingly fantastical. The best example of it is the design of the creature, which is a mis-match of realism and genuinely terrifying. Also, the horror element is heightened by the environment the movie takes place in: it is all subterranean ducts, sewers and concrete underground structures. It is world of hidden places and desolate traps. It feels artificial and remote. It feels like a labyrinth, and it feels alienating. It feels dehumanising.
Outside of that, there were a few other things that I liked. The American-conspiracy plot had potential and seemed the most interesting element. Unfortunately not only did it not lead anywhere, it also had no impact on the main characters. Another good element is the cinematography. It is rather competent and elevated the horror scenes greatly. I think it is fair to say that the horror scenes were well executed; yet, it is hard to decipher the emotional core they were supposed to have.The crux of the movie is that it relies too much on its satisfaction of misleading the audience versus telling a story. That is when it hit me: The Host is actually Korean Black Mirror.
Black Mirror is a British TV-show that delights itself in emotionally disturbing its audience, under the guise of pondering on the use of new technology. Similarly, this movie is not interested in telling a story, or having some sort of message, or any other thing a film can do. Instead it is interested in playing with our expectations. Instead it is interested in killing-off its main characters only to have them resurface later on, which it does repeatedly. It uses humour only to shock us more when it brings back the disturbing horror.Furthermore, I realised that is actually Bong Joon-Ho's whole career, or at least the few movies that I have seen: use a trope or a genre to emotionally trick the viewer.

149,wynonasbigbrownbeaver,"Good CGI and some adventure, and an interesting story line.",7,25 May 2009,"I almost want to give this a higher score due to the uniqueness of ""The Host"".But what I will say is that the CGI was very convincing and the details on the monster/fish/whatever-it-is. Overall it seemed that the producers were trying to create a PG-13 rating and attempted to make it as bloodless as possible. There was that fine line that it seemed that it was approached with kiddie gloves.The adventure was pretty good as it is split between the ......(possible spoilers below)....siblings in their attempt to rescue their youngest member of the family. Some political scandal undertones nested nicely in this and wasn't at all in my face as I was watching this. The sub-plot twists were decent but almost interfered with the main story such as that whole lobotomy ordeal and the not-so-real biological weapon that the media was publicizing. Sometimes throughout the movie I felt a little bored but when it picked back up to the main plot, I got my stimulation back.Much of the acting is over exaggerated but I think that was more of an English dubbing problem.What seemed a little drawn out was the last scene when the trio that combats the monster along the waterfront. It was a battle that seemed about 10 minutes too long.The ending doesn't get any farther than cliché than it could. It was a different ending that strays from the norm. While it was a sad conclusion it was very acceptable ending in which I didn't feel cheated into watching.Overall, I recommend the Host for its CGI and story. I think I would have given a higher score if was in the 90 something minute range.",The Host
150,Pingo-2,"From Cannes, 2006.",9,1 March 2007,"There it was - just in front of my eyes. This wonderful movie.Last year, a friend of mine went to Cannes Film Festival with a short-film we made, and he called me up - extremely exhausted and wild - and talked about this film. I couldn't believe a Korean monster-movie would be any good. So I just told him to calm down.Yesterday I watched this, and it is not good. It's awesome. It's wonderful. It's terrific! It might be the best monster-movie ever made - and I've seen a lot of them! THE HOST begins with something that is extremely important right now: the environment. It spins on on this theme and pulls the whole terrorist/biology weapons-thing into it, pulls USA into the story and starts to unravel around a family who lost their youngest family member to the Monster.And I say Monster with Large M. Because you will SEE the Monster within 10 minutes and you will KNOW the Monster. It IS the Monster and it will haunt you. It is totally wonderful. No other movie dares to show the Monster, and no other Movie could do it this good. Any other movie showing the Monster would be laughed at. But this film gets away with it. Why? I don't know. It is, probably, a combination of extremely good computer animations and superb script. It could be the wonderful actors, but it could also be that the theme is so tightened and so perfectly directed.THE HOST is a wonderful and very nice film. I loved it. It is a difficult movie to have watched. It is sad and it is a bit ""unfinished"".But it yet one of the best Monster Movies ever made. Maybe THE best.",The Host
151,ChiefGoreMongral,GoreMongral's Review: The Host,8,27 February 2007,"Monster movies are a bit of a dying breed you get a few here and there and most of the time they are of the Sci-Fi Channel variety. However there comes every now and then a monster movie that makes you stand up and pay attention. 2 that really impressed me recently were both directed by the same man Neil Marshall, Dog Soldiers and The Descent. Thinking that I would need another half a decade to get another it was to my surprise that a Korean Movie company was planning a big budget monster film. Not just that but the FX were being handled by ol'Pete Jackson's crew at WETA. Say no more I was there which leads to my review of The Host.The Host starts off with some illegal dumping of some chemicals into the Han River which over time leads to a bit of a mutation problem in the waterway. The first 30 or so minutes of this film are some of the best I've ever seen for a monster movie. Conveying the story as if it could happen to any of us, one minute everything is normal then you see something out of the ordinary and pass it off as an exotic animal only to have it turn back and attack everyone within its grasp. I do not believe I ever seen such a powerful beginning to a monster movie....EVER!!! After that 30 minutes or so we do dip into alittle slow time only to get us acquainted with the family and most of their back story. Most of this was handled very well with humor only being interjected in moments not for long periods of time...you taking notes Hollywood. Just when things begin to slow down luckily director Joon-ho Bong knows when its time to interject the beasty into the film bring it with all its savagery to the screen.I did mention WETA did the effects and all I can say is WOW!!! Guess what Hollywood just got taken to the woodshed as The Host's Monster looks more real than 95% of the CGI crap that we have to put up with today with these so call Multi Million Dollar Productions. Saying this keep in mind Im for the most part Anti-CGI as most FX crews.directors etc do not seem to understand how to handle it. Man in a Suit monsters is my favorite as well as Animatronics but with this film the FX are on par with the best you've ever seen, Jurassic Park, Lord of the Rings you know the suspect list. WETA my hats are off to you for making such a kick @ss monster and making it convincing.The story is a monster movie but the director also throws in some political topics as well. Some will be turned off to it and others will embrace it. I personally did not care as long as it did not detract from the monster movie feel. Though at times it nearly does in the end things even themselves out and the movie is able to succeed as a multi-layered film that in the hands of a bad director would have turned this movie into garbage.In closing I cannot stress enough how good this movie is. Yeah its slow in a few parts here and there but my oh my does it make up for it with an interesting monster and cast. Not designed as a gore film but almost like a monster movie with political overtones this film succeeds in nearly everything it tries to do. Weither you order a foreign DVD of this, get the American release that is coming or go to the theaters this is a very very solid film that will be remembered as such as time goes on.Score: 8/10 Very Good, The Host delivers the goods on nearly every front perfectly. From what may be the greatest start in monster movie history to its climactic closing battle you will more than likely not be disappointed. You can call it the Korean equivalent to Jaws, I call it fun viewing!!!",The Host
152,victor7754,Korean Urban Legend,10,19 August 2007,"The Host is a strange and peculiar film and very refreshing, as it brings the monster parable to a dynamic perspective. The film goes from humor to sadness without giving a warning, going back and forth between the two emotions like night and day. It seems to be asking us to recognize how serious and damaging we can be in our decisions and what we can turn into because of them.It seems America is the monster that infected Koreans waters causing birth defects in the next generation. Families that could have been strong were made victims to this poor decision. A U.S. official orders the dumping of Formaldehyde in the sewer system of a Korean city. This is the action that created the Urban Legend of the sea creature, a slithering, gobbling, ugly, frightening, and most disgusting 30 foot tad pole.The direction is beautiful. The film dwells in the sewer systems as a family searches for their little girl. The scenes with the monster are gripping especially with the little girl hiding in a hole, alone, hungry, but spiritually strong. The film has an unfamiliar tone with it's approach on telling it's tale. It's ability to take the mood from light to dark is affecting. Once the parable comes to life as we witness that we lie in the belly of the beast that is destroying the world, that we created this monster for usury, that is when the film truly becomes effecting. The monster consumes everything without need for it. Consumerism has infected the individual and is destroying everything in it's path for progress in the Age of Invention. The power of a family is destroyed by it.A strange and beautiful film",The Host
153,ianwagnerwatches,My Introduction to a Great Director,8,1 May 2020,"Written and directed by the now world-renowned Bong Joon Ho, the Host is the first film of his that I became acquainted to.

154,BibChr,"For what it's worth, it took two viewings",7,19 October 2016,"The first time I tried to watch this, I was drawn by all the raving reviews and the eye-catching special effect sequences in the trailers.But I just couldn't last the whole movie. The messy, over-the-top, all-over-the-place performances of the lead adult actors combined with the messy, unfocused narrative just turned me off. It was hard to focus on a main character; but each candidate (apart from the little girl) just was the sort of person who, in real life, would make you back away slowly so as not to attract attention, and find something entirely else to do, far away.So years later, again caught by all the praise the movie gets from all quarters, I made myself try again, and sit through it.This time I got it, I caught the sort-of center to the plot, and more or less enjoyed it.

It brings to mind the original King Kong or Godzilla.Acting, well done on all levels, with somewhat 2D characters(Lost a point here). Plot, a bit tired, but still well done. Script decent, but nothing really new. Special effects, not big budget but better than most for what was spent on the film. Scripting was decent. Suspenseful, amusing in spots, serious in spots. Could have had a better soundtrack(-point 2).Overall, a decent way to spend a couple hours.",The Host
157,powerfull_jedi,The best anti-American monster movie ever made(sarcasm),4,11 August 2007,"This movie seems to be getting tons of praise as of late, I went to a screening a while ago and I'm back, the result: not much. The Host is an average monster movie at best, the mere fact that it's being compared(marketing-wise, that is) to Alien and Jaws, especially after seeing it, boggles the mind. Alien and Jaws were scary from start to finish, were somewhat serious and kept you tense, this one, however, is anything but. From the trailers, you'd expect this is a straightforward monster movie and you know the rules: monster shows up unexpectedly, a group of heroes try to take it down and that's it, but this one...uh.. While I was watching the opening credits I noticed this movie was nominated at Cannes, a troubling thought went into my mind for a split second, but I shrugged it off... only to realize it came true, then I spent most of the movie trying to figure it out. Nobody knows the origin of most of the many movie monster, it's kinda part of their charm, the origin of the monster is directly revealed in the movie. The opening of the film, reveals a medical facility somewhere in South Korea, but not just any facility, the US military base where an American doctor and Korean doctor are arguing over what to do with tons of bottles of apparently spoiled formaldehyde, what do they do? Flush it down the drain and even the doctor's line ""Think broadly"" is given with a sinister edge. What's the worse thing that could happen? Well, for some odd reason only a single tadpole was infected by the insane amounts of that liquid and 6 years later we cue to a somewhat happy family comprised by an elderly man with his slacker son(Park Gang-Du) and her grand-daughter(daugther of his slacker, sleep-prone son), the old man also as an unemployed son and a daughter who competes in archery contests, it seems like an OK day, when an odd shape is seeing hanging from a bridge, the locals try to play with it, only to discover that it's a man-eating monster, in the middle of the panic, Park Gang-Du somehow losses her daughter and sees her get abducted by this mutated tadpole(and thanks to the previous scene we know who's fault is this, now don't we?) In the funeral(where all the family members are crying was not funny, by the way), an odd plot point related to a virus(which turns out to be a hoax perpetrated by...can you guess again who?) is introduced and family find out that their little girl is still alive ans they try to track monster down, kill it and save their daughter. That's the synopsis, question is: is it any good? No. The scares are very few and even those aren't very good, the humor in some scenes is either inappropriate or not funny at all. Overall, it's one big snooze fest(the couple next to me actually fell asleep at the start of the second-half of the movie and some even walked out) as it somehow switches to a virus-related movie(that apparently has nothing to do with the actual plot, but somehow placed with a counter chemical used by US troops...hmm...OK...). The CG used in the creature is probably the only positive aspect about this movie. It's just not worth it, I don't think I'd even recommend this as rental, unless it's was a really cheap rental fee.",The Host
158,ronevickers,Tremendous Creature Movie!,9,24 March 2007,"To get right to the point, this film is a terrific addition to the vast range of Creature Flicks....after the opening scene, it kicks off at a great pace and barely lets up throughout the 120 minutes. In many ways it is a number of themes in one, and an underlying sense of fun & slapstick is apparent along the way. The special effects and sound track are excellent, and the leading actors take every credit for their lively playing. The film does sag a bit, half way through, but when the momentum picks up again, the run to the climax is quite relentless. For fans of genuine monster movies, this one is not to be missed - you won't see better!!",The Host
159,cyberknight,Bad Timing,2,14 February 2010,"In short, it's a film about a monster of unknown origin. It comes from nowhere and is eventually killed, without any more explanations.It opens with waste from a morgue going down the drain, maybe somewhat implying that it has something to do with the monster's original, but that's never revisited in the film. Maybe it's an environmentalist manifesto, but that's speculative (like artificial nuclear power being the source of Godzilla in the 1998 film).The beginning was wonderful. I could feel the boredom the characters were living on screen. The details of the scene, the colours, everything was really well placed and filmed. When the monster appeared, it was good enough (looked too nimble for a creature that big, but not as bad as the huge orc from ""TLoTR: The Fellowship of The Ring"", more like the velociraptors from ""Jurassic Park"").After that, though, the film goes down the hill, all the way to the bottom, but not fast. The flm was supposed to be dramatic and/or thrilling, but in the middle of the most tense scenes, a completely unfunny comic line pops from nowhere and destroys the whole mood. The first time it happened, I thought it was just a misunderstanding, but the next times, I realized that they are part of the script, as the music changes every time, as if Road Runner was about to pass by, followed by a breathless Willy Coyote. Those awkward scenes get more seldom toward the end of the film, but that doesn't help saving it, as the general mood is completely wasted by then, to the point I couldn't care if any of the characters would survive.More than good jokes, a successful comedy line requires perfect timing. Unfortunately, the clumsy comic timing and feeling of the director was not just pathetic, it ruined the main dramatic line. I tried to watch this movie a second time, but I simply couldn't stand it, much like its loose remake, ""Cloverfield"", though for different reasons.As for the story, it makes less and less sense as the film develops. In the beginning, the monster eats a lot of people, but saves one for a later snack (a girl, related to the main character, a man with some kind of brain damage).At one moment, a person is scratched/bitten by the monster, and survives, what gives it some kind of infection or powerful adverse reaction, culminating in it exploding! The film doesn't show the person actually exploding, just blood splatting on a curtain, the exactly same scene reproduced in ""Cloverfield"". Although kind of interesting, this plot device is NEVER used again whatsoever (just like in its Hollywoodian clone...)Cutting to the end (because there is not much more worth reporting in the middle, filled with a lot of stupid and irking decisions from the main character), there is the main character, the kiddnapped girl, a sidekick boy and, of course, the monster... Then the military use a toxic gas to kill the monster and most people around it... Although it looks like the final solution in ""Cloverfield"" (which I name ""The Return of The Living Dead Solution"", because of the nuke'em all ending used in that 1985 film), it's not! The main character survives the toxic attack, as does the boy, but the girl dies. The last scene shows the main character dining with the boy, who seems a bit ""slow"" (maybe an effect of the toxin, which didn't affect the main character, as he was mentally impaired from the beginning).I have to say, nuking the zombies/monsters and killing all the characters was lame back in 1985, but acceptable in a ""the military don't care"" manifesto kind of way. In this film, it's just lame, as it is in ""Cloverfield"". That's as bad as the character waking up and discovering the whole story was a dream (luckily, at least THAT didn't happen in this film...)",The Host
160,mcnally,"A Monster Movie, after all...",7,26 December 2006,"I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. A huge box office hit in Korea, The Host is a good old-fashioned monster movie, and a lot more. The director introduced the screening by saying that the film isn't really a monster movie at all, but an emotional Korean family drama, and he's right, mostly.The family in question is a strange one. There are no mothers and no spouses, just a grandfather, his three unmarried children, and the daughter of his eldest son, whose mother abandoned her shortly after she was born. The grandfather and eldest son run a food stand next to the Han River, and one day, a gigantic lizard-like monster emerges from the water and attacks the people picnicking along the riverbanks. In the process, 13-year-old Hyun-seo is carried off before the horrified eyes of her father Kang-du. The family grieves together in the hospital to where they've all been quarantined until Kang-du receives a staticky cellphone call from his daughter, who is alive and begging him to come and rescue her from the monster's lair, somewhere in the sewer system.The reason for the quarantine is that the government believes the monster is carrying some sort of virus and are trying to limit exposure to the rest of the city. The problem is that they've called back all the troops that they'd first sent to capture the monster, and now it falls to this dysfunctional family to find their child. After breaking out of the hospital, the whole group embarks on a search and rescue mission armed only with a couple of rifles and sister Nam-ju's bow (she's a bronze medal-winning archer). They're all ineffectual in unique ways. While Nam-ju (Bae Doo-Na, so great in last year's Linda Linda Linda) is an excellent archer, she's slow to take aim, which cost her the gold medal. Brother Nam-il is a university graduate who can't find work, so he's turned to booze. And Kang-du is just generally lazy and a bit dim-witted.There is quite a bit of humour in the way the family members interact, as well as a fair bit of social and political satire at the expense of both the Korean and U.S. governments (the Americans are blamed for dumping toxic waste that created the monster in the first place). This was amusing, though pretty heavy-handed.The cinematography made use of lots of rain and cloudy skies to convey the claustrophobic feeling of the sewers even when we weren't actually there. In fact, the only sunny skies in the film occur just before the monster's first appearance.While I did find the film enjoyable, I felt it ran a bit long, and stretched credibility a few times too many. It's a monster movie, after all, so maybe I shouldn't have had such high expectations. The effects are well-done and it was certainly fun to watch, but it's not an art film by any stretch of the imagination. The theme seemed to be that even dysfunctional families are still families, and that we need to take care of each other and not expect our governments to protect or rescue us.",The Host
161,johnslegers,The monster movie for those who don't like monster movies,8,22 February 2011,"I watched ""Gwoemul"" aka ""The Host"" expecting a campy monster movie in the style of Godzilla or Cloverfield and while I was watching it I learned it was actually a social critique of post-modern South-Korean society and most particular the destructive nature of American political and cultural influence. This critique was done with a clever mixture of drama and comedy behind the backdrop of a monster story and filled with far more symbolism than I've ever seen in any European or American film. The cinematography and the special effects were also more than decent.Fans of typical monster movies probably won't like this film since it's just not a typical monster movie by any standard. If you are, however, a fan of political satire and you're not afraid of some cultural experimentation you may consider this a masterpiece.",The Host

Interested? Then read on...Can we perceive this monster as the threat from NORTH Korea? It's not such an outrageous idea: it is hinted at the start of the film that the US military is responsible for the creation of the monster - insert the notion of the fallout from the Korean 'police-action' and the creation of the Communist state north of the 38th parallel.The monster crosses the river-as-border (mostly) by bridge: how often have we seen the cold war 'exchanges' beloved of '50s/'60s film makers take place on those very constructions? Even the featured family (supposedly dysfunctional under-achievers) might possibly represent the notion of American 'paternalism' in South Korea: i.e. Koreans cannot be left unsupervised or trusted to make their own way in the world... add to this another US military doctor who looks suspiciously like Elmo Lincoln (the '20s screen's cross-eyed Tarzan) and the plot becomes as murky as the river.Still, I could have imagined the whole scenario.

It said on the cover that the Host turned the park into a bloodbath. It wasn't in the film. There was no bloodbath, in fact there was very little blood. I felt a bit cheated but the film was fairly spooky so i guess that made up for it. but i must say it was very funny and i guess that made up for the lack of gore i thought i would see. Once again the Japanese have made another decent monster movie and the monster looks pretty good too. Mostly believable in most parts. the characters were good to watch especially the bumbling Dad, whose mostly asleep through some of the picture and cracking beer cans. If it had, had the bloodbath i was expecting during the first 10 minutes then, i'd have love this movie but instead i just liked it. maybe if i watch it once again i might like it and it might grow on me. other than that yeah it was fairly good to watch.",The Host
164,zerogirl42,Monster Movie That Can't Make Up Its Mind,7,22 April 2007,"There are some brilliant moments in The Host, but when it all adds up, it isn't a brilliant film. To sum up, a family bonds together to save its youngest member, but encounters ridiculous obstacles on the way.The Host aims to be an action/horror film sprinkled with biting comedy and hits the mark for the most part in the first 30 minutes, but the formula falls apart in the later half. The pacing becomes uneven and very slow and could benefit from tight editing. There's some clever storytelling going on, but it gets bogged down when the film takes a heavy-handed approach to political messages. The messages aren't the problem, but the style chosen for the storytelling later in the film is completely different from the beginning.The tone of the story is completely erratic. I didn't know what I was watching. I don't want to spoil the story, so all I will say is the movie didn't leave me satisfied. I felt like the old bait and switch, very lured in at the start, but ultimately not an enjoyable experience towards the end.The only reason that I'm rating the film as high as a 7 is because of the acting. The quirky characters kept my attention (I wouldn't go so far as to call them dysfunctional like in Little Miss Sunshine but they do have problems).Also, the movement of the monster is quite good. I liked that The Host wasn't a gore fest either. It has disturbing imagery, but it's not as intense as something like Saw or Slither.",The Host

First few minutes of the movie are very engaging with the emergence of the monster which is marvelously created in cg. The situation becomes tense till then. But there is a major change after that. They lost the plot completely engaging comedy worthlessly and endlessly. It becomes boring in middle with stretched out comic scenes in which you won't feel like laughing as its completely foolish. The movie grips again towards the end when we are able to witness the monster again. Overall I felt that it could have been much better if they have edited it short making it more packed. The cg monster takes up the movie on its own. Great effort on that. Moreover its not in English so its up-to you if you wanna watch this one. For me its good not bad.,The Host
168,miloc,"Funny and scary, top-notch monster fare",8,24 February 2008,"Joon-ho Bong, the director and co-writer of this marvelous satirical monster movie, clearly loves the conventions of the sci-fi/horror genre; he also clearly loves smashing them. A family gathers in an evacuation center to mourn a lost child; astonishingly, and discomfitingly, their grief goes over-the-top into parody -- you start to giggle and feel guilty, and then, realizing the humor is intentional, keep on giggling. A moment later, an ominous figure enters wearing a bio-protection suit, and you barely have time to feel nervous before he takes a pratfall. It's the kind of irreverence that may worry the conscientious western audience.But Joon-ho is less worried about taking the genre seriously than he is making a rousingly entertaining movie. After a brisk bit of backstory he brings us to a sunny day on Seoul's Han river, where a dimwitted father (Kang-ho Song) and his sweet, smart daughter (Ah-sung Ko) help to run a food stand. Some onlookers notice a curious, indistinctly seen creature drop from a nearby bridge and swim through the water. Within a few moments that creature will be seen very clearly indeed, in a sequence both startling and exhilarating; there's none of this ""Cloverfield"" coyness about what-does-it-really-look-like. Few directors in this field are so generous with their monster, and the special effects, presented quite matter-of-factly, in broad daylight as it were, do not disappoint.Joon-ho's head-on approach is bracing -- he pushes the gas-pedal so strongly that you almost fail to notice how complex the story is that follows. There are satiric swipes at the U.S., with more than a hint of Iraq in the aftertaste, and also a nice allegorical fable about unity in the face of danger. While the family that the film centers upon bicker and argue, they remain comic and ineffectual. Their eventual cooperation in the face of crisis pulls them through. (The message is reminiscent of Kurosawa, whose sharpest jabs were at selfishness and egocentrism.)The monster is a hoot. (Watch out for that tail!) The performances are smart and often poignant, especially the young actress Ah-sung Ko, as a resourceful child in great peril. And, without giving too much away, the film has at least one magnificently scary moment, when Hyun-Seo (Ko), leaps to catch hold of a rope -- she clutches it, dangling for a moment, then lets go -- and then we, like she, are held breathless, in suspension. Truly first-rate.Highly recommended, especially before the planned American remake comes out. Now that, unfortunately, is something to fear....",The Host
169,yellowtail_tuna,Korean film about a monster and the love of family,9,26 September 2020,"Unlike many monster movies, the monster in ""The Host"" is introduced without being tantalizingly held back beforehand. A peaceful sunny afternoon in the riverside of Han, the monster suddenly appears and starts to attack the people who have been hanging around. The tranquil atmosphere has changed in a matter of seconds. After a girl is taken away by the monster, her family is in grief, but they soon realize she is alive.Although the monster is visually prominent, I am not sure what genre this film belongs to, horror, action, comedy, drama, or satire. Maybe none of them, it is just a Korean film. You will see whatever you can never see in a Hollywood film.The monster itself is not special. The design is unremarkable and the CGI quality is mediocre. What makes this film exciting is not the monster but the people who are reacting to it. They confront it being frantic, desperate, or courageous. I'm surprised at how many ideas there are in the action scenes, such as situations, devices, tools, choreography, and camerawork.The government announces a prevention measure on the virus that the monster has spread. When the family wants to look for the girl, they soon face Kafkaesque bureaucracy. While they ask medical officers and police for help, they can't tell who they can trust. It is a satirical depiction of society.It is a film about the love of family. And being in a unique quality of a Korean film, it is an emotional drama and silly comedy at the same time.

Great cinematography, great score, great acting (you may recognize one of the leads from Joint Security Area and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance), great directing, great story. Frightening, intense, beautiful and subversive with a twisted sense of humor. It's refreshing to see Americans taken down a notch for a change (although not in a mean-spirited way, the Koreans are made fun of as well, really, it's humans that are criticized, as there are good and bad represented on both sides). An interesting aspect is how it predicts how the citizens and government react to this situation of mass hysteria. In desperate events humans are useless and horrible, and heroic and courageous. It's very well thought out (the t-shirts worn by protesters of the captivity of an ""infected"" man is one of the examples). My only complaint is the CGI isn't always top-notch.If you like well-made inspiring survival end-times type action horror science fiction dramas with social and political satire, or if you want to see something different and refreshing, you need to see this.",The Host

173,Solipsisticblog,"A fresh and invigorating take on the ""monster-on-the-loose"" story",10,14 March 2007,"Forget all of your expectations of what a horror should be and prepare to be amazed by the latest high profile Korean import ""The Host"". When viewing an American horror film, whether it be the monster-on-the-loose or slasher variety, you generally know what to expect. Surprises are hard to come by and we are usually treated to tired retreads of the same formula, scenes, and dialogue. By now ""Halloween"" and ""Alien"" feel like the old standards and most new horror entries seem like karaoke night at the Holiday Inn.Director Joon-ho Bong's film is likely to make some viewers uncomfortable because he keeps dashing expectations and taking his story in unexpected directions. The director generates tension by taking the monster movie and throwing the rules out the window. He keeps you on your toes. Telling the story of a gigantic hungry amphibious creature that wreaks havoc along the riverbanks of Seoul's Han River, ""The Host"" is a wonder. It's primarily the story of a father searching for his daughter who may or not have been killed by the monster. His family aids in the search and along the way they laugh, grieve, and deal with old wounds. It's sort of like ""Little Miss Sunshine"" meets ""Alien"".The film is subtitled which is likely to limit its success in American markets, but those willing to do a minimum amount of reading will be rewarded. You will want to see the film for its odd, invigorating moments such as a scene where the family grieves for the little girl they love and assume killed by the monster. Their grieving reaches such a fevered, ridiculous pitch that the scene, which we assumed sad, becomes insanely comic. ""The Host"" is full of these moments that manage to be sad, scary, and comic all at once. That Joon-ho Bong can sustain this wild tone without becoming ludicrous is quite a feat.Like the original ""Godzilla"", ""The Host"" is partially a cautionary tale about the dangers of environmental recklessness. I won't give away the monster's origins, but they are hilarious. In the creation of the monster, the special effects staff makes a pretty good use of a limited budget. By the film's climax, when the monster faces off against the determined, battle-hardened family members, we accept the reality of the creature.Go see this one. It's fun, odd, and invigorating. And it's closing moments, perfect and touching, make the entire journey worth it.",The Host

It does not focus on the monster in question or some renegade soldier/scientist who is trying to stop it. Instead, we follow a family bound together by their love for one another and their desperation to find a young girl imprisoned in the creature's lair.The scene in which the monster first emerges is one of the most impressive sequences I've seen as the audience is thrown in amongst the panicking crowds; the abomination always lurking somewhere in the background and growing ever closer. The special effects are excellent here and manage to create something unique, inhuman and actually quite terrifying.But what matters most about this film is the heart beating at its center. You begin to feel for the family and, as the confrontation with the monster grows nearer, you begin to worry about which - if any - of them will escape with their lives.This film is a triumph.

Obviously the acting isn't going to be good (especially since it was dubbed), but I wasn't looking for good acting in a ""monster movie"". The movie is a little less than two hours, and there is maybe only 20 minutes total that was entertaining. I give the special effects team credit though. They took a monster from a previous movie that had hair, and turned it into a monster with scales instead.

Although flawed, it is an entertaining South Korean film with decent special effects that keep thing lively.Immediately after watching ""The Host"" I was quite disappointed and was going to give this movie a 4 or 5 (out of 10). But after thinking about it and reading some other people's thoughts, I realized a good portion of my disappointment was the TERRIBLE voice-over acting. Do NOT make that mistake, but get the subtitled version with the original actors... it is a much better film that way.Without the distraction from cheesy English dubbing, the movie has more emotion, more weight and more tension. One of the best scenes was the surprise of the monster first running down the shoreline towards the crowd. The shot kept going for awhile and really drew you into the craziness and fear of the crowd.Sure there are logical flaws (uh, WHY pour toxic chemicals down a drain?) and unrealistic action (let's just escape from the military, cool?) but the monster is original and intriguing (ie. does backflips to move from beam to beam). The environmental messages and anti-government sentiments are nicely intertwined allowing for many analogies to be drawn (which may or may not really have been the intention... and that's fun).The story about family coming together to rescue their own is touching and the best part about the movie. I liked that it was not your traditional Hollywood ending and that there was no ""magic bullet"" that once discovered easily destroyed a challenging monster.Very cool, and kudos to this import. Glad it got a wide release and earned itself a dedicated fan base!",The Host
178,paul_tremblay,The National Character in The Host,8,8 July 2008,"The interesting part in The Host is how ""nationals"" and ""non-nationals"" are portrayed. An American doctor orders the dumping of dangerous and toxic material into the river (he's the bad guy, akin to American atomic bombers in Japan giving rise to Godzilla and other monsters). A Korean technician exhibits a national weakness complex by complying to the order. Without any material protection, the country is left at the mercy of a foreign agent. In need of supervision, they rely on US interest to show them the way: it does not work (hence, the dumping).Korean national psyche in the movie is also symbolized by the motherless family, lost and confused. The family's mother left home, but the aunt comes and uses her archery skills to fight the beast; the girl herself gives her life to save the boy... The woman (mother figure) sacrificing everything to save the country.The Korean family relies on themselves AND low tech solution (a bow, an arrow, itself a symbol of Korean history) to defeat the American super high tech toxic invasion.Highly recommended.",The Host

180,running_with_scissors,a Monstrous Disappointment!,2,17 January 2007,"First of all let me say the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks superb and the CGI is reasonably done. It's a shame then that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment, ******** SPOILERS BELOW ******** From the opening scene we can see this movie is anti-American, normally this sort of stereotyping wouldn't bother me (we Brits get enough from Hollywood) but here it's not subtle about making the Americans brain-dead morons. It goes past the point of realism and your left wondering if a Yank has raped the directors mother.The grieving scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts going downhill.Here we are introduced to the Olympic medallist Auntie and drunk Uncle who walk into the memorial and start blaming the father for his daughters death, then hitting him before they all start rolling around on the floor crying. Hardly realistic bonding at a time of crisis!The whole virus sideline is ridiculous. If the Americans know there isn't a virus, why are they wasting time, money and resources investigating? The US government agent orders the brain drilling of an innocent Korean for nothing, making the Americans look evil (or stupid), it wasn't helped by the fact this guy was cross-eyed for comical effect.The movie is about hunting the monster. US and Korean special forces are assigned to finding the creature although through-out the movie they are invisible. The only people hunting the monster, in the whole of Korea, is the main family and some random tramp who appears at the end to save the day! Naturally a few US/Korean agents try to stop them along the way.The sister was only included in the movie so she could make the vital shot at the end. It was clichéd, you knew it was going to happen but to make it worse she does bugger all until that part! and my final annoyance, how the hell did that kid survive at the end? the monster had been swimming with it's head underwater for about 5 minutes! why didn't the monster eat the kids in the first place?",The Host

But there are 2 things to be gotten out of the way for ""international audiences""-- 1) If you have no idea what East Asia went through during the various health scares just after the year 2000, you may fault this movie for being ""over-the-top""-- when in fact, its portrayal of human reaction is quite ""realistic"". 2) If you can't deal with ""laugh-tears"" or the way Korean/ Eastern genre movies ""mix genres"" and disobey the ""catharsis"" principle requiring ""pure"" comedy, OR tragedy, etc.), then you will only be able to appreciate the parts of the movie ""belong"" to genre which you classify it into (""comedy"", OR ""tragedy"", etc.).",The Host

Actually, the interesting part is that the story revolves around analyzing the human nature. Although the mutant creature is the cause of everything, the characters matter the most (""The mist"" comes in mind somehow).
Mixed feelings is the definition of this. Satirical, funny, awkwardly funny, then there's drama and so much drama that it turns out to be funny; also some action scenes, some ridiculously funny scenes and many awkward moments; the black comedy is pretty prominent here actually. I like how it jumps from dramatic scenes to comedy scenes.
There are some symbolic scenes here too. I'm not going to reveal them of course, but I must mention the scene where all 4 main characters are gathered at the table and then something happens. This is not a spoiler because the scene is very obvious. Powerful and emotional moments like this are actually scattered throughout the whole movie.
I don't know why I saw some horror tags. I don't actually see too much horror in this... maybe some shocking moments, but far from horror.
The creature's animation was awesome. I'm not a big fan of CGI (especially movies abusing special effects), but this is CGI done with style. The movements and... acrobatics of the creature look very organic, they're very smooth and delicate. I was trying to understand the concept of the creature, for some reason... it's an ichthyo-amphibian mutant or something, but its behavior is not at all similar to a fish or a salamander or frog. Well, this is not the point; the point is that the governmental corporations are corrupted and USA sucks... look I'm being funny now. No, seriously... great movie!",The Host

Interestingly this might be patient zero of the action-heroine-with-a-bow trope. This film was truly influential in ways no one saw coming, it seems.Also the big, mutated catfish monster looked really stupid especially when it started flipping around like Olga Korbut, more weird than scary.

We get to know and like the characters, feel with them and watch them progress in more than the literal way, meanwhile we still get fed enough screen-time of the monster. The amazing thing is, that our protagonists really have a good reason and motivation to concern themselves with the monster and we don't just get the usual premise, that the military has to remove the threat. It even takes it a step farther and involves the opinion of civilians and the government deceiving them.All in all a satisfying monster movie with several little interesting story lines and side-plots that never leave you bored, sprinkled in between is a bit silly humor, but never too much to ruin the mood.",The Host

His eldest son, Kang-du (Kang-ho Song), is a little slow and spends most of his time sleeping when he's not hanging out with his daughter, Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko), watching his sister blow the national archery championships. Meanwhile, Kang-du's brother is a layabout lout who can't get over his days as a young revolutionary. Things come to a crisis for the Parks when a creature rises from the depths of the Han, causing death, destruction, and dismay as it drags Hyun-seo back into the brine with it.Mudskipper Looking like a giant mudskipper, the creature makes its appearance early and not in any kind of spooky ""hidden in the shadows"" way. When it comes on the scene, everyone knows it. Luckily, the effects (at least on the small screen) are top notch which really adds to the excitement.After the attack, everyone present (and still breathing) is taken to a government-run shelter. An American present at the attack is diagnosed with a virus and the word is spread that the creature is its host (thus the title). The only other person exposed as much to the dreaded fish is Kang-du. Already distraught enough about the loss of his daughter, he's soon taken aside for some surely painful tests. Little does he know that Hyun-seo is still alive; a prisoner of the creature in its sewer lair. When she places a brief call to Kang-du he tries to get his captors to believe him. Alas, no one in authority in THE HOST gives any credence to anyone other than other authority figures. Kang-du and the rest of the Parks easily escape the lame excuse for a quarantine center and begin their futile search for Hyun-seo through the sewers of Seoul.I won't go on any more lest I give something away. Suffice to say that this is another fine play on a genre film by Joon-ho Bong. The last work I saw from him was MEMORIES OF MURDER (see Cashiers du Cinemart #14), a fine play on the serial killer film.

BAE Doo-na is a very beautiful and expressive actressher eyes are almost a special effect in themselves, as startling as the eyes of Emmanuelle Beart or Bette Davisand she is terrific here. She is heartbreakingly good in everything I have seen her in. SONG Kang-ho is a real movie star. This is the fifth film we have seen him inhe simply disappears into his character like very few stars can.Its score may be the best part of ""The Host"" and I hope it is available as a CD. Cinematography, editing and all other tech credits were outstanding. Director BONG Joon-ho said in an interview that he couldn't do as many monster shots as he wanted due to budget restraintseven so the monster was properly scary and repellent.But it isn't really a monster movie as such. The evils are bureaucracy (both Korean and American), petty tyrants (ditto), the horror of being a client state occupied by the armed forces of another country, the frightening combination of military power and stupidity shown by the United States are worse than the monster. It is also about the indelible ties of family and culture, the unbreakable bonds between parents and children, the ability of otherwise undistinguished people to become heroes in the face of evil and the nobility of striving to overcome a crippling affliction.It is worth seeing in a movie theaterthe sound effects and score are what digital sound was made for.A really good movie",The Host

The idea of a modern monster movie with goofy Shaolin Soccer-style writing is intriguing, but the movie sits in the imperfect middle ground where it's neither serious nor fun enough as it's trying to be. The writers create a bit of shallow melodrama, vague settings and unbelievable characters and then suddenly create a mutant monster to attack all the inhabitants of the city. The acting is all over the place - take one instance when the family is mourning over the loss of the little girl (the hinging factor of the movie), and all of the actors transition instantly from mourning to just plain silliness, making the entire sequence ineffective. The monster itself, as awesome as it looks, doesn't even feel like a threat most of the time, which is a result of both bad writing and bad sound editing - bad writing because the entire city doesn't seem to worry about a colossal river creature eating and stealing humans, and bad sound editing because every time an action sequence begins the volume of the soundtrack and effects drop significantly, which really kills the intensity of those moments.

I never go see monster flicks, and went to this one just because it's Korean, as I like Korean movies. Having read all the positive comments, I have to agree with a lot of them, and I learned something about monster movies in the process. However, I could never get into the ""comedy"" elements of the movie. I knew, OK, this is supposed to be funny, but in the context of the movie, I couldn't even break a smile. It's not the kind of movie where fart jokes work. People have commented about the ""ordinary"" family in this movie, but they are not an ordinary one, but an extremely dysfunctional one (at least in society's eyes) -- a la ""Independence Day"" -- which is what makes it interesting. Like most monster movies there are plot holes everywhere, which you're not supposed to think about; and the villain -- the US military and their Korean buddies -- is way too broad and obvious (not to mention that the actors are awful).

201,leeleejensen,Steady Decline,6,25 January 2021,"I have mixed feelings about this film. On one hand the first attack is one of the best creature feature sequences in film history in my opinion. The curiosity of the public to this big octopus looking creature in the water leading into the sheer panic and dread as the camera pans onto it charging towards the group from a distance without changing camera angles is purely brilliant and horrifying, and the ensuing madness (in particular a scene inside a large container) is truly terrifying to witness. However, after this initial attack, the film slowly devolves into a second rate family drama with less intense and spread out attacks from the continually less intimidating beast. The conclusion nearly wraps up the film but the expectations built up by the first 20 minutes lead to an ultimately disappointing viewing experience. That said, the film is far superior to the majority of Hollywood monster movies and is worth watching just for the harrowing opening scenes, so give it a watch if you're looking for an inconsistent but watchable creature feature.",The Host
202,markbeardslee,Host This!,9,13 October 2007,"It is crisp, hip and contemporary.The family owners of a riverside snack shop in Seoul, Korea become terrorized by an unnatural beast which arises from the Han River, courtesy of pollution by the US Army. How can this NOT be a box office smash? South Korea's biggest box office hit ever, ""The Host,"" is truly an unexpected achievement and, in the right hands, a clever, fun, gory and grisly good time. Director Bong Joon Ho pulls off a cinematic coup in this 2006 release. Fans of horror and humor films alike should find this thoroughly post-post-modern take on ""the monster movie"" a surprising delight.Here's the plot, in a nutshell: American military occupiers, portrayed as evil, uncaring madmen and as incoherent idiot simpletons, unleash a horror by ordering tons of toxic chemicals to be dumped into the Han River, South Korea's main inland waterway, which just happens to run through the capital city of Seoul, population 13 million. For this American, it is fun to see fellow Americans stereotyped as such. This film's producer, Choi Yong Bae, does not flinch at turning the tables on a Hollywood that has characterized Asians and other minorities as villains or buffoons since movies began.Further, ""The Host"" offers up a version of a ""good"" American, the alien hero who dies in the initial confrontation with the monster but whose death reveals that the monster itself is the least of problems. The monster is a ""host,"" we learn from America's Centers for Disease Control, because it contains a pernicious virus that will kill anyone with whom its bodily fluids make contact! Thank you, heroic foreigner, and goodbye! Where have we seen that before? That newcomer South Korean filmmaker Bong can deftly offer such a departure from such early Korean monster film tragedies as ""Wangmagwi"" (1967), and suddenly splash this montage onto the silver screen, is a testament to the true sophistication of South Korean film today. It cannot be ignored. ""The Host"" is a sophisticated, scary, fun and gory monster movie which can hold its own among the likes of the ""Men in Black,"" ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Alien"" (to which this monster has an eerie resemblance) film franchises.Of course, the film has its problems. What of the killer virus that the monster unleashes? How does the monster-killing ""Agent Yellow"" spare the film's stars while torturing the beast? Why doesn't the monster simply devour the young victims it abducts even as it searches for food among adult humans? But these are questions that can be asked of almost any ""horror"" film, particularly those involving giant monsters. The Japanese ""Godzilla"" franchise holds its share of nonsensical plot meanderings, but it remains beloved. ""The Host,"" too, deserves to be forgiven such nit-picked non sequiturs.This film boasts no brilliant acting performances, nor does its cinematography leave viewers gasping. What it does offer is impressive special effects, lots of sarcastic, underhanded commentary on the state of political affairs between South Korea and the United States, and plenty of terrifying, suspenseful and astonishingly stomach-churning sequences. The acting team turns in acceptable work for a monster film, with the emergent South Korean star Song Kang Ho (""Swiri"", ""Joint Security Area,"" ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"") standing out in an unorthodox lead performance.In some areas of the United States, Korean films are the rage. I can only suppose it is because of films like this, which transcend genre, offer familiar spectacles in unfamiliar domains and poke harmless fun at ourselves. Hats off to ""The Host.""",The Host
203,captelephant,"Good Characters, Bad Plot, Weird Vibe",6,19 March 2009,"THE GOOD: The Host is a fun monster movie that's elevated slightly above the Hollywood hum-drum because it spends time developing likable characters and clear relationships. Great acting, a fast and entertaining first hour, and an interesting protagonist make it clear why audiences enjoyed this as much as they did.THE WEIRD: The Host is ""campy"" in a way I've never seen before. A weird sort of subtle comedy runs under a majority of the scenes (including some very serious ones) giving the film an oddly persistent feeling of humor. The end result is similar to camp horror in that it's self-aware and doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's all approached so earnestly it almost becomes dark comedy. I found the technique fresh and inspired, if sometimes confusing (ie: slapstick at a little kid's funeral?). Whether or not this oddity was caused by the English translation is irrelevant since the translation is, after all, part of the movie.THE BAD: Nearly thirty minutes of screen time (all in the second half) is wasted by a huge dead-end plot line that hamstrings the initial fast-pace. **SPOILER** The virus, the tests on our poor hero, agent yellow, all of it... just made no sense. They drill a hole in the main character's frontal lobe (after admitting there's no point to doing so) but then he's up running around hours later. Then the WHO (an unusual choice of villain) finally deploys their controversial, American-made biology-killing gas and a bunch people (and kids!) just stand around in the cloud occasionally giving perfunctory coughs. It's just ridiculous, and could have been cut in favor of a proper show-down with the beast in its sewer lair thirty minutes earlier. **END SPOILER**Shortcomings aside, the Host is an enjoyable and considerably better than ""bargain bin"" monster flick. 6/10",The Host
204,iwf120586,Not Bad at All.,7,24 January 2021,"Was recommended this film by a professional friend and I have to say it's a really great film.
Intriguing until the end.",The Host
205,thomasaaa123,"Not bad at all, but not that great either",7,28 July 2007,"It's a decent enough movie. But I got a little disappointed, given that I had a high expectation. After all, it's one of the few Korean movies which got (relatively) wide release in the US, and it is the reigning Korean box office champ. And I totally loved the director's (Bong Joon-ho) another movie -- Memories of Murder (MoM), which is one of my all-time favorites among all (not only Korean) movies.Like MoM, The Host is a tasteful mix of suspense and humor. The dark and tense background is often peppered with (sometimes utterly unanticipated) hilarious moments filled with irrelevance and quirks of the dysfunctional family.Also like MoM, The Host's main focus is not really the title matter. Rather, the monster is meant to provide a background against which a more human story could be told and the characters could be exposed more effectively. But in practice, unfortunately, the story is a little loose and the characters are not well-developed enough. As a social and political satire, the movie is a touch too clichéd, unsubtle and melodramatic. As a story on family relationship, it is a bit under-developed. While the monster is understandably not the main focus, I am surprised at how little interest the filmmakers have in developing it. The lack of mystery surrounding it makes the monster rather uninteresting, whether or not it represents any real-life perceived threat (e.g., North Korea). Having said that, I guess I might be a little unfair in that I was comparing the role of the monster in The Host to that of the murder cases in MoM. The latter immensely enriches MoM by providing a shocking trip deep into human psychology. The monster in The Host might be a reminder of some unpleasant historical legacy; but its appearance in the movie provides no deep insights, and from the storytelling's point of view merely offers an excuse for a national emergency situation.Still, The Host does give plenty of entertainment. The CGI isn't all the great (at least compared to what can be made with hundreds of million of dollars in many Hollywood movies nowadays). But many live sequences are shot and edited with tremendous craftsmanship. Stylish, crisp and full of dynamics, the technical aspects (except the CGI) of the movie remind me of Samsung LCD TVs or cell phones (yes, I meant it to be a great compliment!), though technical excellence is probably what we have now come to expect from a typical Korean movie, having been spoiled by many previous Korean hits. Also, the characters are likable and the acting is generally great.Overall, I would recommend this movie. But I don't think it's as great as many critics have made it out to be. And if you haven't seen MoM yet, pick that one first!!",The Host
206,quietgrave,Unreal,10,23 February 2021,"It's almost insane how well made this movie is, between the attention to detail and how the character of the monster was built out of short, completely visual scenes. The CGI even holds up pretty decently, the texture resolution is super low but the weight of its animations combined with practical effects on the environment as it interacted with it was more than enough to sell its presence in most scenes. Just an amazingly well written and directed movie, I can't think of a single thing to criticize other than the creature effects, which is understandable for a movie made in 2006.",The Host
207,soniaandree,Can't decide if it is a comedy or utterly tragic.,6,27 April 2007,"The first half of the movie is rather slow, even the monster eating humans takes an infinite time doing so. You also get a sense of comedy, in the presentation of the characters and their daily lives, especially with the ""village idiot"". Then images of Godzilla springs to mind, with the monster attacking people. The family therefore goes in search of the missing girl, with a mix of comedy and tragic psychological tension. The lobotomy moment was especially remarkable, as being the one scene which makes you wonder if the operation did end up making the idiot guy smarter. Our reaction as viewers was: ""What the heck is that movie?"" and ended up with ""the ending is actually not bad at all, for such a weird movie"". Yes, the action going towards the second half of the movie is going somewhere, plot-wise, so that the viewer gets more and more hooked. In the end, we were left wondering if most people got killed by the monster or by the government. Better watch the movie and draw your own conclusion. Recommended for a good Friday eve. screening with friends.",The Host
208,nick-1896,Rubbish - absolute rubbish,2,25 July 2007,"I read a few reviews about this film before watching and I'm beginning to wonder if they haven't all been written with the Korean authorities standing behind the reviewers at gun point. The plot line is childish and dated. It's basically Godzilla with a bizarre touch of Outbreak.The acting made me cringe. It oscillates from hokey, comedic and frenetic to overly heavy and portentous. The English dub is done by voice overs who are even worse than the original actors - which believe me, is quite a feat. The editing is bad, certain scenes were protracted to an uncomfortable degree for no apparent reason. Mid chase the family have dinner. I could've gone out and had mine in roughly the same time and caused the same amount of excitement.Special effects, B grade. I wasn't too bothered about them - they certainly don't live up to current Hollywood standards, but for such a rotten movie, they're on par. The actual monster was animated fairly well, but the design was a hotchpotch and not particularly believable. Given the resources that were obviously thrown at this, most Polytech grads could do better. People have waxed lyrical about the scenery - the mighty Han etc. What I saw was a muddy grey river, concrete walled and full of sewerage. The rest of the city was reduced to, at best, the occasional skyline. The director chose to blur the background out most of the time. There was certainly nothing there to encourage a visit, that's for sure. The camera work was pretty good in places, I'll grant them that. But overall, a dreadful Godzilla remake. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. The resources that went into this pile of poo could've been put to much better use. Except the 'actors', who should never appear on a screen again. I'm not Korean, maybe I missed nuances that appeal to an Asian audience, but I doubt it. I just can't understand how anyone bar the cast's mums and dads could say they enjoyed this with a straight face.",The Host

Finally, Netflix added it. I really wanted to like it, but despite the other reviews, I've found the FX bad. The animation was amazing, but there was something odd and the monster seemed out of place, I think it was the texture. Maybe if it had some scales instead of polliwog skin (I guess that is what they wanted to achieve?) it would have looked better.Anyway, that wouldn't have matter if the movie wasn't boring. I just didn't feel anything (except from the scene with the pictures). The tense moments didn't feel tense, or maybe it is just my love for monsters. And some parts were too slow. But I had already watched half of it so I had to finish.However since there are people here that loved it so much, I suggest you to watch it, maybe you are one of them and pass a good time.",The Host

But - honestly - I doubt it, and question why so many people have called this a spectacular creature feature.The design of the creature was nicely done (though not scary, and definitely identifiable at all times as CG.) But the pacing and acting, and tone of the film? Well, let's just say that by the time I reached the halfway point, I found it more interesting to reset my IMDb password and write this review than to pay any attention to the screen. This may sound sarcastic, but right now I find myself remembering Attack of the Alien's Deadly Spawn with misty nostalgia!! :P4/13 Revision. I actually put this back on today, primarily to show my husband how horrible it was. Actually, it does get a better with time. Do I consider it fantastic? No. But it grew on me.

I expected much more action (big scary thing chasing people around, terrorizing the city) but what I got was a few nice big sequences surrounded by a lot of slow scenes and people chasing the monster rather than the other way around. I still liked it, but more for the characters and comic moments than any kind of thrill. The portrayal of Americans is pretty funny, albeit not too positive... but it's all forgivable, especially since it's inspired by an actual US Military employee ordering a bunch of chemicals dumped into the Han River.

212,ApeLieUproar,Infuriatingly bad.,2,25 March 2016,"I think most of the budget must have been used on the monster, with almost nothing left for the script. Because the script is pure nonsense. It's infuriating because there seems a germ of a good idea here that was squandered.Okay, so the deal here is, a giant fish-monster suddenly appears and goes on a rampage, killing a bunch of people and kidnapping a bunch of others. So the first thing the government cares about is a virus that doesn't exist? Meanwhile, the government seemingly has no interest in capturing or killing the monster, despite the fact that the monster is not shy and frequently goes out into the open to catch its prey. No military personnel staking out the monster, no monster hunts (despite a palpable lead), no inquiries or news reports into what the f**k this thing even is or how it came to be. No, all they care about is a fake virus and quarantining people for no discernible reason. Perhaps the point is to try and establish martial law, but this is never explore and nothing comes of it. It's completely bizarre. So it's left to a family of idiots, of whom one's daughter has been captured by the fish- beast. The family does enormously stupid things but they're apparently the only ones who care about the existence of this mutant creature and somehow end up fulfilling, with the help of a hobo, what should have been the government's responsibility of actually killing the thing. The daughter ends up dead, and this is quite sad, but I felt annoyed as much as or more than sad about this, especially since the movie ends with the father and a boy he adopted eating dinner (?!)I realize there is some kind of social commentary going on here. Something about the unfeeling of government officials and such. But why can't a commentary be made in a way that makes actual sense???",The Host

It was the closing film, shown last night (July 30) in the Auckland International Film Festival. There was a packed house of which about 60% were Korean people living in New Zealand. The audience was very attentive and the reception given to the movie was justly big applause. The animatronic effects have been done scrupulously well and viewers can look forward to being enthralled by the skills of those who ""made the monster"". We got the print which had come straight from Cannes and apparently the film opened just two days before we saw it in Auckland. There is no doubt that this movie will go on to do very big business wherever people appreciate great horror films.

220,Gurochan,Pretty Good!,7,8 January 2018,"First off, I have no idea how so many people can say they don't understand the humour in this film - it's simple, slapstick stuff. A lot of it was obviously to hammer home how dysfunctional the Park family are (such as the funeral scene), and it works well. The people who don't understand it seem to be overthinking it.The film has good and bad points, like most. Some of the good points:
The monster looks good, it moves in a really cool way and isn't something that's been done before. It looks like a huge, mutated mudskipper or newt.
The family at the centre of the film are quite likeable even with all their faults. That seems to be a problem with a lot of horror films nowadays, the characters tend to be so shallow and stereotypical that you have a hard time caring about them.
A lot of unexpected things happen in this film. The ending particularly. It was upsetting, but at the same time it was a refreshing change from the usual formula.
CGI, sound, lighting and the camera shots all seemed excellent to me, there was one slightly dodgy moment when the monster falls over at the end but other than that it was great.
The jokes/slapstick moments were funny. There wasn't some huge culture barrier, it probably just wasn't to everyone's taste. It's the sort of film that will have a character do something, and you'll find yourself laughing and facepalming at the same time.
It's pretty accessible for western audiences. I've seen a few Korean films that were sometimes hard to understand, but this one is easy. Everything is understandable to a western audience and the subtitles are very well done.Bad points:
At no point is the film actually scary. It tries to be, but because of the comedy it doesn't quite ever feel frightening. It's more of a drama with a monster in it than a horror movie. It mixes comedy and tragedy, which you don't see often.
There's the odd plot hole or two - what the heck was with the fake virus (why?) and where were all the quarantine/police guys after the first half hour?
They did have a bit of a dig at the Americans. I thought it was pretty funny, not being one, but I imagine some of them would have been upset by it. Shin Godzilla did the same thing, maybe the Americans are replacing us Brits as the 2D movie bad guys now?All in all, it's well worth watching. I've spent most of this week watching monster movies and this was definitely one of the better ones. It's pretty hard to get it right in this genre, but, although it has a few issues, this film is one of the better ones.",The Host

Let me be the first to tell you that the comedy in this movie stinks. I find the scenes played for laughs to be stupid. The actors look stupid to try to make you laugh but only a select few make me laugh and those laughs are just chuckles.

They should had focused on doing just one genre, but they tried too hard on doing like a Hollywood block buster.It amazes me that Kang-ho Song participated on this film, is like when Anthony Hopkins did that role on Transformers. Kang-ho Song had several roles on some of the best South-Korean thrillers. Here is doing a clumsy, goofy, comical relief main protagonist. The monster CGI is really bad.

The movie itself was very visually interesting. It had a great look and feel to it.The movie itself? Not all the great. I understand the high IMDb score as it's one of the biggest Korean movies ever but it doesn't exactly hold up to Hollywood.The strengths? The characters were unique and like able. The family dynamic was interesting, believable, and moving.There were a few very good stand out scenes. The first look at the monster attacking people, the break out from the hospital, and the brother getting away from the cops were all good.The Weaknesses? The premise of the film is a big bad evil white American doctor forces a poor Korean employee to dump hundreds of bottles of chemicals down the drain because there is dust on them...When your entire movie is based of of such a flimsy start it's hard to build from there.The story doesn't get much better. Filled with a bit too much anti-US propaganda as well. It gets in the way of a realistic story imo.The CGI on the monster is OK. It looks a bit dated but isn't all that bad.The story kind of drags on. At times isn't very believable (this monster with huge teeth was able to ""hold"" the girl without harm twice) Like i said it's an OK movie with some great visuals.

227,Cooper75,Superb,10,13 November 2006,"A film that definitely lives up to the hype. If you can make it to one of the few Cinemas that are showing it in the U.K., I urge you to do so.When a worker at a U.S. Army base in Korea disposes of a large amount of Formaldehyde down the drain, it's bad news for the residents of Seoul. Because in true monster movie style, the pollution causes something in the Han river to mutate and grow very large indeed, and of course, it's very hungry.Opening with an absolutely breathtaking sequence in which the creature emerges from the Han river and rampages through a fleeing crowd, 'The Host' sets it's stall out early as a movie that will not play by the rules. Simultaneously a monster movie, comedy, and family drama, it is testament to the director that all these elements are pulled together into a satisfying whole. The central storyline following one man and his family's attempts to rescue his daughter who has been 'abducted' by the titular creature, gives us an unusually human angle the likes of which have never been seen in this type of movie. These people are very ordinary, they are flawed and they are frightened and you can't help but root for them as they mount their rescue attempt in the face of impossible odds. They are also very funny, the bickering between the siblings resulting in some big laughs.As said before, the film does not play by 'the rules'& 'The Host' will surprise even the most jaded movie-goer. Some of the plot developments will definitely catch you off guard, and ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** you may be shocked at which characters do, and do not, make it to the end credits.As for the creature, some have said the effects bringing it to life do not compare to the likes seen in big budget Hollywood fare. This, in my opinion, is simply not true. At no point did I question it's existence, and the interaction between it and the characters / objects around it was for the most part seamless. Also it appears that the creature has been designed to display recognisable aquatic characteristics, and, while on the large side, is not in Godzilla like proportions thus adding to it's believability.Featuring some great performances, effects, several exciting set-pieces & a pounding musical score, teamed with a script that balances humour and horror with great skill, 'The Host' is really something special.

Not quite.,7,29 December 2008,"The Host is without doubt expertly directed and the star of the film is probably the most interesting creature creation since the Kothoga, but it never really impressed as much as the films it's being compared to, such as Jaws and The Thing. Maybe the 'hype' machine had too much influence on me, but I think because it breaks the blueprint slightly and is in essence more a drama than a creature-feature means that it doesn't quite reach such stellar company. Unfortunately it is it's own victim in that sense, because while it is a good film, it holds little to offer on repeat viewings because it won't let you settle into a specific mood. Director Bong Joon-Ho probably summed it up best himself when he said that it is less a monster movie and more a film about a kidnapping, where the kidnapper just happens to be a mutant amphibian.Stripped to it's core, The Host is about the importance of family bond and that that bond can and does shine through during crisis. An already struggling unit, our family - the Parks - must deal with the unthinkable: The youngest and brightest spark in their clan has been taken, presumed dead, not by man, but by something that just shouldn't exist. Joon-Ho sets up this idea nicely by having the creature born from nature - and of human interference no less, as opposed to something supernatural or otherworldly. The grounding of the movie in a recognizable family reality is probably it's greatest strength. Like the Park family, you just accept what happens and deal, and in the end, it's not that much of a stretch.Various arguments surrounding the reveal of the monster I found slightly tenuous because for all it's refreshing glee, the scene in the park - indeed, the monster itself - is merely the catalyst for the main idea and besides, when your creature design is this cool, why not show it off more? I actually praise Joon-Hu for being so subtle and almost blasé in his approach with this jaw dropping moment. It's superbly pleasing that not 20 minutes into The Host, we see a full shot of the creature diving into the river while curious gawkers scratch their heads leading into a fantastic directed sequence where our slippery beastie asserts his need for breakfast. Yes, the best bit with the monster (but certainly not the last) is done less than half an hour into the film, but like I said, this isn't Jaws or The Thing, so being patient is rewarding in different ways here.To it's credit, The Host still belongs in the same category as the above mentioned films because like them, it's strengths lie in it's ability to create a human situation around the monster that's both compelling and interesting. It just doesn't do it as well as Spielberg or Carpenter's respective films and unfortunately suffers slightly from the same old clichés as well as being a tad too long. In the end, it's still a must see for it's striking cinematography, original creature design, interesting performances which include some great borderline slapstick comedy and a not so flattering portrayal of the US government.The slight identity-crisis-suffering screenplay does lead you astray at times, but it's definitely above your average Hollywood blockbuster, and even though being Korean might make it cooler; it doesn't necessarily make it that much different. But then again, Cloverfield proved that being unique in the monster game, doesn't always save you from cliché either.",The Host

I love monster movies, but not this one.Their monster wasn't real enough. That is not a problem in itself, but then you automatically no longer take the film that seriously.

231,dalbrect,Undeserved Hype - a snooze-fest at best,3,2 August 2007,"Don't be deceived as I was by the 'glowing' reviews quoted on the DVD box. ""Wildly entertaining."", ""a seriously scary freakout."", and the worst of all, ""ON PAR WITH JAWS."" This movie is none of the above.Normally I don't bother with writing bad reviews for films but I can't believe this one is resting at a comfortable 7 on IMDb. It doesn't deserve it.After a so-so opening daylight attack by a monster created by, what else, chemicals dumped by lazy scientists, this movie goes absolutely nowhere and it goes there sloooowly. Basically and improbably, a girl is snagged by the monster (I'll give them points for a good creature design but this ain't no WETA creation) and her semi-comical family spend an hour-and-a-half tracking her down...in the sewers surrounding the Han river. Their search lacks any suspense-again, someone called this on par with Jaws?-and by the time they find her you realize it was all pretty much pointless. Other than that, a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in one funny scene involving a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop.Blech. This was bad. I'm not kidding. You want to see a rotten monster movie? Rent Deep Rising. At least you'll save 30 minutes of your life.",The Host
232,voltK,"*PLEASE, Don't waste your money on this overrated Korean krap!!!!",2,10 November 2007,"This movie sucked for several reasons. First of all, the CGI is of the quality of a TV commercial. I'm serious. The people who wrote reviews saying the effects are so cool must be smoking crack. The Geico gecko looks more realistic than this monster. Second, the monster is seen in broad daylight at the beginning of the movie, so there is no build-up of suspense. Then, you don't see the monster for a long time, so it really sags in the middle. The monster is not even scary-looking at all. It looks like a big mutant catfish with hind legs. Also, most of the characters act retarded, doing stupid pointless things for no apparent reason. Some might call this 'quirky', but it's really just lame filler to compensate for the lack of interesting story and decent movie-making skills. There is nothing likable or interesting about any of the lead characters. Third, this movie is sloooooooooowwwwwwwwww. There is a lot of boring, pointless dialog. In addition, during these scenes of dialog, the camera doesn't move or cut at all, so you feel like you're strapped in a chair with your eyes pried open a-la Clockwork Orange. The little girl in this movie is trapped for days in a sewer. Ironically, this movie drags along so slowly that YOU will feel like you're the one trapped in a dank sewer for days.Ignore the hype and the 7-star rating. Hollywood movies may have their flaws, but at least they're entertaining.",The Host
233,primo-st,Feel like a Drama/Comedy/Horror/Adventure/Cult/Apocalyptic/Action Movie? Then this is for you.,8,28 January 2011,"The Koreans have a history of putting a creative twist on your average plot line (My Sassy Girl, Oldboy) so that you are left stunned and smiling. Gwoelmul, or ""The Host"" is no exception. I was literally on the floor laughing for the whole first half, despite the on screen violence. This quality of black humor is unparalleled by most horror/comedies (Its on a Shaun of the Dead sort of level). The humor is clever and creative, nothing you would expect to see in a typical bromance comedy (Eg Pinapple Express, Wedding Crashers) and really will get you giggling. The main character follows the generic good for nothing but loving father persona, and you will love and sympathize with him from almost the very beginning. This movie delivers everything you could possibly expect in any movie, its a real Jack of all trades in that sense, a complete mixture of genres but seems to collapse a little in quality towards the end.If anything its worth watching purely because it offers new ideas to the horror genre (At the expense of scariness however, this is no 28 days later) Bong Joon-Ho's ""The host"" is really a quite good, and for the most profitable film in Korean history, its a worthy watch. Enjoy!",The Host

I gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot. the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot. my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it. borrowing some ideas from movies like Resident Evil and Aliens doesn't result in a movie like them. if this going to be a top Korean movie, I'd rather won't bother to see even a Korean movie trailer...By the way, this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising.

235,AThames,"Political satire, slapstick humor, drama, tragedy, action and more!",9,24 July 2013,"I was a little skeptical going into this movie, and it was actually my friend that ""forced"" me to watch it. I have had it on the shelf for a long time, but I was too afraid that it was going to suck. S. Korea produces awesome movies. But from what I had previously seen, I did not think they could master a monster movie. I knew it had a genius director behind it(Joon-ho Bong - Memories of murder, Mother), but I also knew it was about a (CGI) monster, and I thought to myself that there was no way a production company in S. Korea could raise enough money in order to produce a watchable CGI monster (I still have trauma after watching the first Resident Evil). But I am glad to say that I was wrong. The CGI was not spectacular (ala Life of Pi), but it was good enough to not take anything away from the awesome action scenes. It's a movie that tries to include a lot of genres; comedy, political satire (on the US in particular), horror, tragedy, intensity, thrills and ultimately (it's Korean after all) sadness. But it does so masterfully imo. The action scenes are really intense. Man they were awesome, I would go so far as too say that they were probably the most awesome action scenes I have ever seen in a monster movie. The music and the cinematography really added to that as well. The plot is very engaging, and you can almost feel the desperation the main character has yourself. The comedy is slapstick humor, it is intended, but I could imagine it could turn some people off, I was able to appreciate it though. All in all a highly recommendable movie.",The Host

It seems like if it's foreign or gay content (not that there's anything wrong with that), it's gold. No matter how crappy it is. This movie called The Host for American markets is billed as ""On par with Jaws."" Exsqueeze me? The short bursts of creature visuals are borrowed from early 50's and 60's Sci-fi movies, and are pretty good, but the in-between horrible acting and terrible dialog drag this flick down to the lower depths of the boring B movies.

237,clarki-17-565167,Not the greatest import 3/10,3,24 June 2011,The Host is rated highly by regular viewers and critics? I have to wonder if this is due to some sort of Korean movie industry publicity drive. It can only be by standards somewhat alien to me that The Host is worth anymore than a surprised and slightly amused glance. Virtually every character is a cliché. If the Korean movie industry began in 2006 and this is the first ever movie made I could understand its childlike nature and the fact it appears to imitate a different Hollywood movie with each passing event. I'd certainly hate to be in Korea in the event of a natural disaster; hurricane Katrina was dealt with more adequately. Look at for the 'comedy' government official who appears in the shelter and be sure to grade his slap-stick falling over for artistic and technical merit. Woeful.,The Host

If you were looking for the cheese factor of a Godzilla flick, This movie has extra cheese. If you are looking for some great creature special effects, The Host definitely has it. If you thought this was anything like a kaiju movie from TOHO you will be somewhat disappointed, and horrified beyond belief at the bad acting and dubbing. The movie does have redeeming value such as a very dark tone when it takes itself seriously, and it becomes a very good movie! Then without warning it crawls into some long drawn out scene or painfully hard to watch acting/dubbing that really doesn't belong. This was the top grossing movie in Korea of all time and I can't for the life of me understand why. I'd hate to see the worst.

241,rigolgm,Has everyone gone mad? This is unwatchable.,1,18 November 2006,"Both myself and my friend walked out of watching The Host half way through because it was so awful. So, what I say below is based entirely on the first half of the film! This film is being promoted partly on the basis of its mixing of genres and styles. This it certainly does. Unfortunately the result is the cinematic equivalent of a disgusting smoothee drink made out of giblets, spinach and chilipeppers.This film has a serious identity crisis and does not know in which direction to take the audience. It tediously flounders from one boring little scene to the next. After 45 minutes nothing fun or interesting had happened - just fairly muted mildly silly scenes that don't make much sense and drag horribly.Everything is just plain wrong about this film. It carelessly throws in embarrassing pratfall-style comedy that is humourless and strips the film of drama. Dialogue is bizarrely written and makes many scenes disposable and irritating as the characters jabber relentlessly. The film also makes too much of the grim fate of the 13 year old girl, which is just pure cynical movie-making and jars with the supposedly amusing folly of adjoining scenes.What amazes me so much is that I hate this film despite liking so many different kinds of horror, be it cheesy, serious or satirical, Western or Eastern. I don't even think this film IS horror or satire or drama or comedy. It's just a steaming pile of monster turd.",The Host
242,matthewmacgyver,Family Drama and Monster Action,6,11 March 2007,"The Host is a decent mix of family drama and monster action with a little bit of slapstick comedy thrown in. The comedy comes at times almost entirely from certain characters over-acting. There is one scene in particular, which although I'm sure it was supposed to be a sad scene, I couldn't help but laugh at the exaggerated responses.I liked this movie. That being said it is definitely overly long. It dragged severely in the after the 1st hour. It could have done with about 30 minutes trimmed from the middle. And although I wasn't a fan of the ending, I can't really think of anything that would have made it better. Overall, the movie is good, but not spectacular.On my patented scale of 1 to 10, (which excludes sevens and decimals), I'd say this movie is a 6/10.

A lot of people died in this movie, but it's not as gruesome as it seems.For people who think this is a horror movie: it's not.It's more a drama than a horror movie. There's really nothing scary about the monster other than he eats people and takes the girl....The ending was a real heart breaker.....but i think the director made the right decision.If advertised right ( which they got off on the wrong foot cuz coming in I thought it was a horror film), this film could be the best film of 2006.it already is in my book.9/10",The Host

The plot is complicated, but is well-built. I gotta be honest by saying that some sequences were pretty much useless. I watched this in original language (obviously with subtitles), and some dialogs were just... weird. That surely didn't ruin the movie, and it's also explainable by the fact that translating Korean's figure of speech must be nearly impossible. The characters are kind of weird, especially the blonde one (which can be regarded as the protagonist, maybe) which is clearly a mix of paternal love, bravery and pure retardation. (yes, pure retardation.) I'm sincerely amazed by the special effects (even though i found out they were US-made) since the monster was beautifully done. Some scenes were simply smart, the movie was also hilarious at certain points.Surely worth a watch, in my opinion, also because it's something totally different",The Host

248,The_Double-Thinker,Best monster movie in years!,8,20 April 2007,"I am a huge fan of the seemingly dead monster movie genre. This movie could singlehandedly revive the style. If you have read any reviews of this movie you have undoubtedly heard, ""A Cross between JAWS and LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE with a little GODZILLA thrown in"". I am hear to disprove those statements. This movie is very original but does draw from other sources. If this film is a cross of anything it is SHAUN OF THE DEAD and DR. STRANGELOVE. The plot is very simple. Doctor pours formaldehyde down the drain, drain runs into river, tadpole is mutated, kills, kills, kills, little girl is taken, family wants her back. I say SHAUN OF THE DEAD because it is a genre-busting film that very much stays within the genre. I say DR. STRANGELOVE because it is very much a satire of the world we live in. Director Joon-Ho Bong (Memories of Murder) is fantastic at creating the mood. The laughs come as easily as the jumps. He couples moments of tension with moments of hilarity, and he does it effortlessly. The cast is great and can handle all the emotions and actions they are put through with ease.

The monster was interesting, but not particularly scary. The plot was full of holes and outright contradictions. The dialog was bizarre and slapstick at moments that required suspense and seriousness. There may be a great deal of cultural difference that is lost on an American, but it was simply ridiculous. The movie was never suspenseful and impossible to take seriously. I felt like I had been duped. The director must have been laughing at the people who sat through this garbage. Nothing about it was well put together, and it certainly deserves none of the accolades it has received.I don't know that I have ever claimed a movie as the worst I have ever seen, but this movie may win that spot in my memory. I love the horror genre, both the good and the bad, but this movie was not scary or ironically funny. If you want scary watch the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. If you want funny, watch Dead Alive or Army of Darkness. There are better options out there, and I recommend using those.

I soon realized that the visuals off this movie were very good. the effects were great, but by modern standards, they were just average. It soon occurred to me that Joon-ho bong was willing to sacrifice his horror/action film to bouts of unexpected humor, which never failed to make me laugh.

251,ponchocrazydaze,The Host - (Beware Those Who Present Themselves as Helpful),8,9 September 2013,"I was very reluctant to watch this movie. What could I expect of a horror movie from South Korea about a mutant river monster? When I noticed the movie was 2 hours long I doubted I would make it past the first half hour. I expected the movie to bomb on at least several levels, plot, acting, directing, character development, special effects. After reading a few reviews and being able to watch this film on NetFlix instant view I decided to take a chance and wow, were my preconceptions wrong. I was delightfully surprised on all accounts. What did I know? I had never heard of director Joon-ho Bong. There were some slow moments but I began to realize Bong took such loving care to develop the characters and let the camera, the acting, and the dialog tell the real story. There were also some interesting shots of Korea I had never seen. This movie had drama, action, comedy, tragedy, satire, suspense, a good story line, character development, more than a few scary moments, and a fresh perspective about the potential effects of outside (foreign) involvement in, and disregard for, the affairs of the Korean culture. This was done without preaching, pretense, or dumbing down the story. I found myself really caring about main characters, a rag tag bunch of losers, all members of a dysfunctional family whose only common bond is the young motherless daughter of the eldest and mildly retarded son, (the charismatic and impressive Kang-ho Song). In an early, thrilling, action packed scene, (which remarkably reveals a good, long look at the monster), the child is carried away right before her distraught fathers eyes. The family comes together in grief and then with purpose to find the child, whom only they believe is still alive and in the monsters lair. At times, I even cared about the monster who was almost perfect in both a symbolic and special effect kind of way. As the film progresses, the biggest horror in the film becomes the crooked government administrators, police, military, media and the medical establishment. They take advantage of the crisis situation for their own self important reasons and contribute less to finding and stopping the monster and mayhem and more towards confusing and abusing the population. I found myself delightfully drawn in and interested for the whole movie. I would watch this film again and I recommend it to others. The old man and the little girl are gems (Hie-bong Byeon and Ah-sung Ko), and the entire cast is delightful, even the bit players. I was happy to see, and took this to be a good omen, that Scott Wilson was in the opening scene. (Wilson is an American actor from one of my personal favorite cult movies The Ninth Configuration, and is also impressive in the little known but very good thriller/mockumentary Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon). And for family lovers of horror movies, (if for instance you can watch Jaws or Jurassic Park as a family) this is a PG-13 delight. Watch this film together with the family and enjoy. But be forewarned!!! There are scenes of death, mayhem, gore, and adult situations, (political and emotional not sexual). My rating is 4 out of 5 stars.",The Host

""Gwoemul"" is one of those movies that break barriers. If you look at the plot, you might mistake this as a typical 'monster movie' (Monster appears, people scream, blahblahblah). But let me assure you, ""Gwoemul"" is definitely NOT a typical monster movie. It goes beyond stereotypes and plays out the monster story plot in a totally new and unique way. It manages to be not just a thriller, but also a comedy and a drama all at once- without making the flow of the movie awkward! The actors are all excellent. Kang-Ho Song, already a famous actor in Korea, definitely lives up to his name; veteran actor Hie-bong Byeon surprised me by fluently playing a character that is totally different from his usual roles; Hae-il Park's character was the first time I ever found another man attractive (I'm a guy by the way), and Du-na Bae, with credits like ""Take My Cat"" seemed comfortable in this character too. Even newcomer Ah-sung Ko shined beautifully, giving a performance that is totally superb for her age.The visuals are pretty good for a Korean movie- first time I ever seen that kind of CG in Korean cinema. The only thing I don't like about this movie is the ending, which is pretty typical ""Korean-style"", but I'll keep that a secret (if you've watched many Korean movies, you'll get what I mean). There is also bits of obvious symbolism here and there, but I'll also leave it to you to find.Anyway, a great movie! Groundbreaking monster movie, a makes-you-sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller, a very funny comedy, and nice touching human drama! Originally, I'd give this movie a 9, but I'm giving it a 10 for its uniqueness and novelty! Kudos to the cast and crew!!! ****SLIGHT SPOILERS**** This is just a ps, but one of the translator's lines: I know that some foreign audiences might find it a bit odd and out a place, but it's Korean humor. I figure that some audiences, especially American audiences, might be confused with the choice of words, but really, me and everyone else in the theater was laughing. Just an FYI.",The Host
254,nyshyguy84,Movie best left to Koreans,2,7 April 2007,"Considering all the hype this film has received, i was expecting something more from this flick. I couldn't have been more disappointed. There was nothing and i mean nothing in this movie that hasn't already been done before and done better. The origins of the creature for example reminded me of something a low budget B-grade Hollywood movie producer would think up, in order to get some quick cash. For someone who has seen many Korean films, the political parts in the movie (which i'm sure the nationalists of Korea ate up) are nothing new in Korean cinema. For those of you who watched many Korean films with politics involved, should know what i'm referring too by now. As far as the CGI monster goes, its good to see the creature was not some blatant Hollywood ripoff, but if they were trying to make it scary they failed miserably. The cast was forgettable, had almost laughable acting skills, and the girl being captured by the creature only served as a mediocre plot line at best. Ending having the usual over the top Korean drama that most of their movies seem to have. Recommended for those who want to see the best Korean cinema supposedly has to offer, ""besides romance movies"", though don't be surprised if its not what your looking for.

I think the greatest thing this movie has going for it is not the CGI or the truly scary moments (which it has tons of) but its ability to solicit emotions you wouldn't expect. I think I love this movie alone just for the scene where the family eats together inside the storage shack. Are they all ""seeing"" the little girl as they eat? I don't really care..because this director captures with no dialogue just how much a family loves one another although they may be very dysfunctional. How many horror remakes and girls in white movies can do that? Hear that? thats every producer in Hollywood thinking if Dakota Fanning would like to play the little girl....thats just sad.",The Host
258,Omegamorph,The best Monster Movie of the last decade,10,28 June 2010,"The Host is a 2006 Korean film, directed by Bong Joon-Ho. The film starts out as the classic Monster StoryTelling, alas an error committed by human injures nature, and because of this, a terror under the shape of a murderous creature appears, to seek revenge. The monster is indeed well introduced, with a first mysterious appearance of a young creature, that is never actually shown on screen because of the shots, and then with a man committing suicide because he has seen ""something dark"" in the water. He's probably the same man who assisted the Doctor that ordered to dump Formaldehyde. What does indeed render The Host unique in its genre, is how this concept is later developed. The Monster itself in the end is somewhat a secondary part of the story, because in this film, the storyline is focused mainly on the human protagonists; a family that has just lost one beloved member, young Hyun-Seo (played with great skill by Ko Ah-Seong, who has been complimented even by the director himself), kidnapped and dragged into the Han River by the Monster. She is believed to be dead until a mysterious phone call is received by the half-retarded (not kidding) Protagonist Gang-Du. The family then starts seeking for the young girl, but is blocked because the creature seems to bring a deadly virus (that in reality doesn't exist, and is only a device used by the US Government), and hence they have been in the area devastated by it (Gang-Du has even attacked it resulting in some blood sprayed on his face), they are put under quarantine. They however manage to escape thanks to mercenaries hired by Hee-Bong. At this point their desperate research for Hyun-Seo begins. It turns out she is trapped in the sewers of the city, in a location that could be called the ""storeroom"" of the Monster since it lays here the captured preys only to consume them later. The scenes in which this location is featured are not much gory as one would imagine - but are indeed somewhat disturbing, especially when Gwoemul begins to vomit (literally) the bare bones of its past victims, creating what could be described as a ""Death Fountain"", and is indeed the major disturbing factor of the film. In the end the creature is killed by Gang-Du, but not before he has to acknowledge the death of his daughter, that sacrificed herself to save a kid, Se-Jo. The Monster, called Gwoemul during production (this would later become the original title of the film), is a gigantic mutant catfish, estimated to be the size of a whole truck, that has a complex Mouth Apparate, similar for those who have seen the films, to the Carnivore Plant in Jumanji, or, more strikingly, the Sandworms from Dune or the Graboids from Tremors. It has three-four claws on each toe of its main limbs, which are used for locomotion, and a row of Fins on the back. The most striking detail is the asymmetry given by what seems to be a developed bladder on the monster's left eye. A very good design indeed, that is portrayed on screen almost perfectly through CGI, created by the Orphanage, and Practical Animatronics effects, built by the well-known Weta Workshop, which also worked on the Lord of the Ring Trilogy and King Kong (2005). The Korean Cast does a great dramatic (if sarcastic) performance and definitely triumphs over the lifeless cast of Dragon Wars (another Korean films which doesn't use national actors as the main characters), the Big-Budgeted Korean Monster Film that came just one year later. The Host is one of those rare Monster Films that almost reach perfection, and is definitely suggested for those who search a monster crossed with a good dramatic plot, a rare event nowadays.",The Host

Maybe its because there was nothing else worth watching on TV. By all means, if its free, watch it to kill time. But if you have to pay to watch it, I'd rather you spend that money on charity.For the life of me, I can't understand the hype behind this movie when it first came out. If this was representative of the best of Korean cinema, then given me Hollywood, Bollywood or Hong Kong anytime, anyday. I'm giving it a 3 purely because of the passable special effects.

It tells the story of a Family, Hee Bong (The Grandfather and Father, Owner of a Snack Bar), his Daughter Nam-Joo (A Professional Archer), His two sons Nam-Il (A Former Activist), and Park Gang-Du and his daughter Hyun-Seo. The film mainly focuses on the Family as they attempt to Rescue Park Gang-Du's Daughter Hyun-Seo, As she is taken by a mutated Monster.

The monster was stupid. The dialogue was very much of the Godzilla Japanese shtick. The incredulous factor was off the charts.

As exciting as it is iconic, this urban creature feature became the highest grossing Korean film in the history of the country, it's moody locations and grim tone (how many films dare turn a memorial service into a comedy?) creating an atmosphere around the monster that lasts even after it is revealed in all its slippery glory in a fantastic daylight attack near the start of the film.For a film about a foul-smelling fish monster to feel as fresh as it does, especially after the American Godzilla seemingly destroyed the genre over a decade ago, is quite an achievement.Bring on 'The Host II', and keep those tourists patrolling the Korean waterways for signs of the beast!",The Host

266,akajohncastle,A Film that I enjoyed from start to finish,9,9 March 2007,"Having just bought this film on DVD on a whim, I wasn't sure what to expect from it having never seen a Korean Film before. I don't normally go for subtitles as i am a little dyslexic but I was surprised that this film didn't really distract with the subtitles.I was enthralled by the characters who on the whole were a family of misfits starting with the father of a Sweet girl living with his father in what seemed to be a Kiosk selling practically everything a person would want. The film started off with English talk, which for me was a bonus. Of course the bad guy in all this was the American scientist who forced his assistant to get rid of some rather nasty chemicals down the sink. What was to follow was the mutation and growth of a monster that could give the Japanese a run for the money. A cross between a fish and what could be only described as a carnivorous frog, it brought terror to the Streets of the South Korean Town, taking from the hands of her father the daughter. What was to follow then was a desperate race to find the Monster and the daughter before she became a light snack between meals. Yes at times the Monster was a little silly looking and the dialogue was a little strange in places but that didn't matter as with effects to match some of the best and worst that Hollywood can offer with other films behind the team including Superman and the Harry Potter Goblet of fire film behind them, this was a film well deserving of the success it has had around the world. The Atmosphere was dark and edgy, the plot line was more than just hunt and destroy, and if you like something more than just a monster movie, then this has it all.It is fun, well made, exciting in parts Well written and very well directed by a man who i hope to see a lot more of in the future.Highly recommended by this viewer.Andy Cooper",The Host
267,algemeen321,Secret message from writer/director,6,7 January 2008,"That's why i love internet. Thanks to it i got to know Asian cinema and i'm a BIG fan of it. They can take any standard theme and turn it into something marvelous. Having seen it is about a monster theme i almost ignored it. This is because Hollywood has served so many craps lately that i got fed up. I give the movie 6 stars instead of 7 due to some unrealistic moments. All has been written about the movie already except that the movie had several elements showing aversion for US foreign politics: (To avoid spoiler i write in such a way only someone who has seen it can understand. It's meaningless if you haven't seen it)...The coroner is American and orders the Korean guy to spill it. Again it's an American telling the Korean the virus story was made up. ""Yellow"" was an American initiative after considering Koreans to have failed etc etc The TV images at the end have the same allure as the US admitting not having found anything in Iraq, even using the quote "" regrettable incident due to misinformation"". (remember this on CNN?) I loved the car splashing scene. Very funny but a strong message too about how politics and media inspire great fear upon us! I love this way of inserting critics on world view while behind funny. Not mentioning the university graduated on TV is a mockery to media. Keeping people dumb by giving most attention to the dumb ones or failures of society(Gang-Du / sister). I don't know if this is referring to Korean media but it certainly does remind me of the western media. While in the west we would consider the bronze medal being great i think in her case it was more meant to describe her failure which only a dumb-ass could admire (Gang-Du) They have so many educated guys there that ""educated"" means nothing anymore. It's the best only that counts. Visual and acting are stunning and message from director/writer is very strong. I really like it.",The Host
268,leapyearcin,"Fun ""critter"" movie (so get off your high horse)...",9,19 March 2007,"What a blast from our film club! Some of the blue-haired suburbanites & high-brow-art-snobs may have been aghast at the audacity of a sci-F/""horror"" film being shown. BUT, those with the fortitude to show had their open-mindedness rewarded, by an entertaining, beautifully shot film. There's plenty to ""chew"" on: say it's an indictment against the government (US, North &/or South Korea), hop on your environmental tree-hugging soapbox, if you need to scratch that itch. OR, you can just enjoy a fun, well-crafted, evenly-paced film, just because.Top 10 fun things about The Host: 10. You get to see the monster pretty early into the movie. 9. There are some great scenes just odd enough to make you scratch your head but not take away from the story's progression. 8. If you saw ""Little Miss Sunshine"" one scene in particular will have you in stitches. 7. It's NOT gratuitously gory. Gore seems to have been mistaken for entertainment/art in some films of late. 6. A great sound track & sound effects, sometimes all the better for their subtlety. 5. The monster's cut & dry, so no mixed feelings: his habitus makes him effectively creepy, & his ""personality"" makes him very unsympathetic. You want them to get this sucker! 4. The family is painfully endearing. They'll frustrate the hell out of you, but you'll want to see what they'll do next. 3. A great blend of humor, fear, pathos, dread; you might laugh as much as you scream. 2. It's a refreshing break from the usual cinematic ""dreck""! 1. It's just plain F U N !!!!!",The Host
269,Hoban-W,"Funny, scary, emotional, intense, thrilling, sad. And then funny some more.",10,18 August 2006,"What else is there to say? The Host elicits every feeling, every sense of urgency, dread, sadness and happiness with ease. And somehow it manages to cram all of that into the first fifthteen minutes. After that it speeds along and doesn't let up. I was with it till the end, laughing when I was supposed to, crying, and even cheering. It is one of those rare films that blends all the respective genres into one with an almost scary simplicity. I shouldn't be surprised, it is from writer and director Joon Ho Bong whose last films the equally brilliant Memories of Murder and the excellent black comedy Barking Dogs Never Bite featured a similar feeling. How does the man do it? Like with his other films particularly Memories of Murder he manages to break the conventions of the genre by frequently poking fun at the rather stale ""monster"" genre and by taking a fresh, appealing perspective. It's funny at all the right moments and even in moments when you feel you shouldn't be laughing you cant help but laugh. It's full of vibrantly realized characters, who each have their ""moment"" that make you laugh at the ridiculousness or gasp at the coolness. It is written with care and love, the pace never stagnates and the dialogue is never forced. The CG monster effects are nice and appropriately unrealistic in appearance. Perhaps too unconventional for American audiences but it really works in the context of the films rather serious yet quirky atmosphere. The acting is excellent, Kang Ho-Song continues to impress, star in the making Ah-sung Ko gives a very good first performance, and the rest of the cast give great performances. All managing the frequent dips into serious and comical and even both at the same time.The Host is a brilliant, brilliant film. I'm so pleased I had the pleasure of seeing it at the cinemas, the way it deserves to be seen. Despite fitting into a rather common genre, The Host is an original. It is a unique and refreshing film, full of charming characters, awesome action sequences and even an emotional poignancy that weaves itself into the film at the most appropriate of times.The Host is undoubtedly my favourite film of the year and one of the most entertaining films I have seen in recent years. If you like your films to be highly enjoyable, but also smart and even emotional, you will love what The Host has to offer.",The Host
270,jonathanluke1986,Most original movie in years,10,19 March 2007,"I was blown away by this movie. In terms of its comedy, drama, special effects, and of course, its underlying two-fingers-up to American capitalist imperialism. The most amazing thing is how it has taken loads of elements from other films and made it into an original and entertaining package. There's monster-movie, horror-movie, sci-fi-paranoid-conspiracy movie, action movie, family drama, anti-authoritarian commentary - all rolled into one! And it doesn't turn out like rubbish! This, Park Chan-wook's Vengrance trilogy, and other Korean films in recent years are a sign that Korea is crying out to be noticed - and with good reason. With the two-fingers-up to America undertones in The Host, it looks like it has valid things to say as well. Don't take to this as you may have done with other disappointing monster movies of recent times - Godzilla, War of the Worlds, etc. I watched this while only being aware of a the small hype around it in the UK, and it thoroughly engrossed me. In fact, I would even say this is the film War of the Worlds should have been - in the fact that there is a big monster (though not alien) threat and there is a hopeless father (Kang-ho Song) attempting to save his family throughout. It pulls of that whole concept far better than Spielberg and Cruise did - which is definitely saying something!

And I never like monsters that have that ""tremors"" type, indiscriminate mouth thing going on.I do agree with the other reviews that the characters are very well developed and very likable, real.It really is too bad that the monster was ridiculous.One point though, this movie has a distinct ""America is horrible"" theme. There were four important negative elements in this movie, all created by Americans or America's government. The Koreans were innocent victims of this abuse.That sort of slipshod blatant racism is offensive, and detracts from what is an otherwise decent film.So I like the movie but can only give it a five because of the terrible monster and racial overtones.Unlike the truly pathetic American Godzilla production starring Matthew Broderick (one of the worst movies ever), you can still like this movie, despite the dumb creature and unnecessary racism.",The Host
272,ErnieMuraoka,ho hum host,3,26 July 2007,"First of all, the director Bong-Joon-Ho is great. His guidance and eye for shooting was wasted on this film. Too bad the storyline was weak. What bothered me the most was the cornball lip sync dubbed voices. It was Godzilla all over again. I would have likened to hear Korean and read the subtitles. The dubbed voices are an insult to the Asian/Korean film makers, its laughable and sent the genre back 40 years.There's a review quote on the front cover of the DVD:""on a par with Jaws"" ---Harry Knowles. This guy obviously never saw another horror movie after ""Jaws""I bought the DVD because I saw a preview on TV of this week's DVD releases on some entertainment show. Of course they showed the best scene which got the testosterone going to buy the disk. The soundtrack was corny too, the music sounded like a European love story, which sucked ass for a movie like this.The CG was decent, the ""moster"" looked OK and didn't look like a weatherman in front of a green screen.The story mulled on about a family looking for their grand daughter which was abducted by the monster. In fact the whole movie revolved about retrieving the 7 year-old. It got tired. Too much family plots and interactions with other family members and less monster scare.I recommend you not buying the DVD but renting it, it took me two days to watch it. I had to turn it off when the family interactions got boring. I just turned off the movie, the credits are rolling as I type this review, the sappy music is going on as well.

273,bertom7,Godzilla is back,8,25 March 2011,"Due to pollution with toxic material by an American scientist, a monster emerges from Seoul's Han River and attacks people.It seems that these times of upcoming terrorism and political suspicion have created a new monster: Gwoemul. An American scientist (of course it's an American) orders his employee to throw old toxic material in the sink. This results into this mutated monster that ends up attacking people, and dumping them in a lost sewer under the bridge over the Han river. Because an ex US-marine officer almost gets killed - but saved by Gang-du, one of the main characters - US authorities get involved and soon they determine that this monster is the host of a potentially dangerous virus.Gang-du is put in quarantine, after having seen his daughter being taken away by the monster. Gang-du and the rest of his family escape from the hospital, and there starts the great political metaphor of this movie: The poor family trying to rescue one of themselves from the real danger - the monster - is being chased by the authorities. The authorities completely loose focus, and the family becomes the subversive danger, instead of the monster itself. In the meantime they try to conceal the fact that there is absolutely no virus.Besides the impressive special effects and the camera work totally in the line of the new generation Korean films, this blockbuster has a kind of black sense of humor. I loved the part where the family is hysterically agonizing over the loss of the little girl, an officer comes in reading out someone's license plate and announcing this person has to remove his car quickly, because it might be dangerous",The Host

I'm always excited when I get a chance to see a new movie, especially if I've heard great things about it. But this wasn't just a great new flick, it was also supposed to be the ""best monster movie since Godzilla"". Apparently, the genre is pretty easily satisfied. Now I'm not going to say it was horrible, because it wasn't. There was some comedy I appreciated (mostly because I'm racist and I think that people from Asian countries have an unhealthy obsession with disease) and there were some valid jabs at the shortcomings of bureaucracy. There were some very well developed characters. But it was slow, and quite a few of the scenes were just tedious as hell. And they shouldn't have been. This could have been a great film, and I think everyone involved in production (including the CG artists) just came up short. If it's on late at night and you've got nothing else to watch- sure.

276,keymanh,Formidable Monster and Humanity of Ordinary People,9,3 August 2006,"A movie focused on a monstrous creature is essentially just for fun time. Viewers do not expect much logical or scientific clarification, which CSI viewers seek. They just want to be psychologically exposed to all the horror, consternation, distress, and panic a monster in the film creates. All they need is some kind of catharsis. Viewers of Godzilla do not ask how the atomic explosion could produce such a monster. Nor do the viewers of Tremors press for Q&A on the 'advent' of that giant underground-leech. The same goes with the leviathan being in Aligator. For them, 'somehow' is just about enough for an answer.Gwaemul, literally, 'monster' in Korean, is said to have been born, following the discard of a large amount of liquid formaldehyde(HCHO) into Han River by 'malignantly' negligent manager of a morgue. The Giant Fish with stupendous fins or legs appears on the riverside and hurts, grabs, and kills people.Kangho Song(plays Kangdu), owner of a vending booth at the riverside, is a lazy guy in the low income bracket. Good-natured father of his(Hiebong) usually tends the booth. Many people frequent this side of the river, including bums and hobos. Kangho lost his daughter to the fish-monster. What could or should he and his family do in that desperate situation? Awesome scenes and fear-inducing camera tricks, and sticky family bond before the overwhelming power of this creature....all these were well expressed in the hand of Joonho Bong, director. Hiebong Byeon's play was impressive.It may not be the best monster-movie I've ever seen but is definitely one of the best.",The Host
277,lameplanet,Not sure what all the fuss is about,6,18 February 2008,"I saw this movie having seen all the hype and I'm not sure where it drew all its great reviews from.Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, but it's not terribly great. I had that vague sense of relief at the end you get when a movie has outstayed its welcome.To be fair, I saw a version that was over-dubbed rather than subtitled and I think that affected the mood quite a bit. A number of the overdubbed voices were sort of gross, cartoonish, caricatured voices that really seemed calculated for farce value. Along with some of the more ridiculous comedy scenes, this left it with a strange sense of not really knowing whether I should be laughing or crying when various characters got killed. The dumb father character, for instance, was so stupid as to be unsympathetic - which is tough because it was his daughter who was missing.I think though, the mood is exactly what the makers were aiming for - it felt early Godzilla-esquire in its mix of solid if garish creature-feature fare and slightly off balance humour. I don't think I really *got* it, but I expect I might get more out of it after a few beers.One thing I really did like were the visuals. Although the monster manages most of the time to look like a guy in a rubber suit, even thought its CGI, it works pretty well against the urban landscape, which often looked stunning. The director showed a lot of style and certainly wasn't afraid to try some interesting angles. I bet this would be great on a big screen.Overall, kind of dumb, but certainly worth watching on an off night.",The Host
278,parks5796,Intricate in my point of view,8,7 April 2007,"Through out the plots and subplots of the movie, in between the many clichés and satire, this movie dwelled, like the monster in the Han river, under a sheet of underestimated views. In my point of view, I saw this movie as a complex satire on the 'monster' genre, while holding up symbolic and ironical parts. Since this is my understanding, you may find this movie to be corny as hell, but I viewed it as a masterpiece surpassing horrible movies I saw just because the ratings were high(Children Of Men, The Queen). The scenes I enjoyed the most were the scenes that, at first, looked to play into a dramatic over clichéd part, but suddenly takes a u-turn into its own creativity. For example, when the hobo was pouring the gasoline on the monster and the man with the last molotov cocktail see's this, he rears back with his only shot to kill the beast and, and, and! he drops it. Though you may think that that could play into a cliché as well, I obviously disagree. I especially enjoyed symbolism in this movie. I've read bios and synopsis' of this movie and I have somewhat strong evidence to perceive what I think symbolized the monster in the movie. I think that the monster is portrayed as the consequence of hurting the environment, also it shows that people only care about concerning themselves with the environment when it only effects them; in this case, the family that is portrayed through the movie are prime examples to this. Another part that shined was the view of the U.S., and the conspiracy of the nonexistent virus; which you can see in the movie because it would take too long for me to write about that. Finally, in the end, when they kill the monster and all is back to normal(sort of), no government, no group, no person tries to clean up the river, they just attach themselves to a hapless cause(agent yellow) instead of getting to the source which is the pollution. Instead of solving the problem, they bypass the hard work(cleaning up the river) by protesting against a foreign government's action to a curable problem that could of been solved with a little cleaning. Great directing, great acting, hilarious satirical parts, great story = 9 out of 10 (In my point of view).",The Host

280,Tzctimdb,Clever and enjoyable beastie nonsensical action,7,18 June 2021,"The reputation of the director is now firmly established, so it is interesting to go back to one earlier work and see how things progressed.This film handles a premise not unlike Godzilla's films, from which surely this takes inspiration: we see how the criminal actions of a few endanger the many with deadly consequences, in Godzilla's case it is nuclear waste, in this film it is chemical pollution.Our heroes are a family of normal people with more misfits than accomplished characters with a hapless patriarch trying to mediate between them, prior to.our creature appearing all the 5 members of the family are sufficiently portrayed to hope for a rich set of conflicts but these never fully materialise.The female characters hold the moral compass and sense of purpose, they are the ones brave, clever, calm but like in romantic opera such qualities never augur anything good for heroines upstaging male characters, the blokes are mostly useless but good hearted and brave.Once the context is set then a suitably scary monster, which nature and moves are eerily realistic, is let loose to test the resolve of our heroes to breaking point.Here the film looses its feet a bit, having established the situation pretty well the film doesn't know anymore what it wants to be: family drama, action film, conspiracy Sci-Fi, political intrigue, or perhaps even all of the above?The weak point of the film is that it tries to be all these things but the script is not clever enough to do so in parallel, so when it becomes one or the other one gets a sense of stop and go and this creates uncertainty which seems to reach the director himself that loosed his hand in some inconsequential scenes that could have been better invested in providing a more solid body to one of the strands in the film, for example the conspiracy theory (there is no virus) is not fully explored ands is left hang there as an uneasy possibility, but so are the different family interactions that are not investigated fully, and as a monster action film exclusively eventually the creature is just to small for that.At the end the film is very entertaining because it is done professionally and with great commitment, and certainly the comedic part is its best asset, but this certainly wouldn't predict a director that would conquer the world with a much more solid and accomplished film in which the monsters become the characters themselves, characters that will emerge also out of polluted water,",The Host

282,tjvinod97,Favourite monster movie of all time,10,26 August 2015,"I was interested to watch this after watching a video where director Quientin Tarantino listed this as one of his 20 favorite movies. Joon-Ho Bong is also one of my favorite directors, as his movies are often very gritty and absorbing, such as Memories of murder and Snowpiercer.One of the things I love most about this movie is that it isn't afraid of just being a monster movie. It never attempts to artistically hide the monster or make the viewer wait for half the movie with only glimpses of the central monster (like in Godzilla). Instead, the monster pops up within 10 minutes in what is my favorite monster movie scene ever.The next thing that sets this movie apart from other monster films would be its main characters, who are a family (Grandfather, Father, Uncle and Aunt of a girl who is taken captive by the monster). These characters are so likable and their reactions and decisions regarding the crisis are very believable. The characters also feel very fresh as their personalities and their careers were like nothing that I'd really seen before. They also manage to be humorous despite the tense situation and it does not kill the tone of the movie at all.Speaking about the tension, this movie, like Joon- Ho Bong's other movies, is relentlessly gripping as it sticks to the plot without delving too deep into unnecessary territory like the main character's personal life or a boring clichéd romantic side story. The dialogue scenes are thankfully void of any boring expositional sci-fi mumbo jumbo or long soapy conversations about the past. Whenever character's converse it is usually humorous and quick.The look of the monster is not what you would expect from a major blockbuster monster movie, especially in relevance to its size. It isn't gigantic like Godzilla, and it does not have any powers like fire breathing. This is because they were going for a more realistic and believable monster movie.The monster is basically a big mutated fish, and it looks very grosteque and intimidating.Because of how realistic, entertaining and gripping this movie was from start to finish, it has my highest recommendation, especially for monster movie fans.",The Host
283,hubble_no_1,Good start but fails to deliver,2,6 March 2007,"The movie does really start interesting. Good character development, funny one-liners, good CGI and the chase is on. But then something happens... well, nothing really happens. For about one hour or so people just keeps running around in dark places and talking about nothing that keeps the story moving in the right direction.It was hard to stay awake during the final 15 minutes, which is really bad when you consider that this is an action/horror/comedy flick. Not really worth seeing, not even if you enjoy movies like ""Resident Evil"". This movie is ""Alone in the Dark"" kind of bad, only that people speak Chinese instead.",The Host

So invigorating to see a fantasy type film in a great setting on a big beautiful screen. Full house (aprox 400-500 people)Classic old theatre style of The Regent Theatre in the heart of Melbourne city.What a great surprise to see a quality entertaining monster flick. You might begin to think as I tend to that the rest of your cinema going days will be spent avoiding such appalling Hollywood ""Crap-busters"" such as Godzilla or (enter current relevant movie here ;-) This film proves that adults can still be taken back...taken back to staring at the silver screen in wonder. It further proves, that a fantasy/adventure monster film can be a serious and funny film at the same time. Formula defying, original, intelligent... comical and sad. Comedy with pathos (just like real life refusing to fit neatly into categories)...very clever film making. Even with the alleged fear of subtitles, I would think there was a massive audience for this film amongst English speaking audiences...if only they would be given the chance to see it.

This film was showed as the last film of the film festival 2006 in New Zealand - Dunedin, and there is no doubt this is the worst movie out of all the films I've viewed.I don't recommend anyone to watch this movie and I believe it's really overrated.final conclusion: NOTHING Special",The Host

290,whitecatus88,Great Entertainment With Brilliant Moments from Bong Jun Ho,10,16 August 2006,"The Host is a film that people have been talking about a lot during its production and the teasers and posters I'd seen to date had gotten me pretty interested. So when it was announced for the Edinburgh International Film Festival this year I had to go and see it.I have to say I was more than impressed with what I saw. The Host is a film that provides something of everything from suspense to terror, from drama to a little touch of comedy, this film has it all. What's more surprising is that it delivers all of them very well and provides great entertainment on the way.The opening of the film is perhaps one of the strongest I've seen. Starting with introductions to some of the main characters we instantly get a feel for who they are and what they are about, all the time with a healthy amount of humour. The first appearance of the creature is viewed quite satirically, or rather the peoples attitude and ""car crash"" mentality is.Then when it races through a busy park attacking people, it's probably the best portrayal of group blind panic I've seen, and coupled with some excellent edge of your seat and distressing scenes. The shot of the girl standing in shock is one of the most disturbing scenes you'll witness, it's not something you'd expect to happen in a typical film and it's indicative of scenes to come.Throughout the film you'll be toyed with, there are the usual straightforward scares, and one so effective I leapt out of my seat. There are also moments like the opening one at the park, where the unexpected happens and you really do get a surprise at the direction the story has just taken.There are other similar incredibly strong moments that will hit you with a shock, and they seem out of place and going against what you believe should be happening. I felt myself looking at the screen in surprise thinking ""That's not fair!"", and that's a great response to illicit.The frequent humour is an aspect of the story that is really well handled, it never detracts from other areas of the story, and often helps to relax a tense or distressing moment in order for the filmmakers to return to the situation and build it up again. Sneaky devils.One of the oddest moments is when the family are mourning wildly in the school hall, this begins sadly and slowly, building in your uncomfortableness and sadness. Then something strange happens, they just manage to tip the performance into humour, just enough to lighten the situation and raise a few sniggers. Then photographers and film crews descend and we're presented with an interesting social commentary, yet you're still feeling the humour of the moment and just coming out from the sadness of the family. It's all wonderfully woven together.The leads are good, particularly the young girl, Park Hyun-seo played by Ah-sung Ko, who is very convincing and strong in character. At times the emotions she shows are so natural and believable, you'll find yourself caught up in her scenes.The other characters continually walk that fine line between comedic and serious performances. Each of them have their flaws which are shown throughout the film, but in the end each get their chance to redeem themselves and sometimes they get multiple chances, often they need them too.That raises another interesting aspect, instead of following a standard route with the characters, their development follows the unusual turns of the film itself and we're treated to surprises and failures when we don't really expect them. Indeed you could almost say that these characters are more human than many fully focused dramatic character based films.The creature effects in this film are quite superb. It has weight and a natural, organic movement. So often CGI creatures will appear to run over the ground or not properly interact and collide with real life objects, here though every effort has been made to address this, and it works superbly.I don't believe I'm spoiling anything about the movie when I say that the ending seems slightly flat against the amount of entertainment that the rest of the film has managed to deliver. It wraps everything up incredibly neatly, with each character having had their shot at redemption. Yet it was a little too neatly tied up for me, although it didn't detract from anything else the film gave.I'd recommend this film even for those not interested in Asian Horror, for this can't be classed alongside what you would expect from a typical Asian Horror, indeed there's not even a lot of horror. This is a suspenseful, thriller, drama, comedy, you're getting the idea. It's great entertainment with some brilliant moments of shock and terror. Well worth watching.",The Host
291,Killer_Croc,A disappointment,8,18 April 2007,"Gwoemul (The Host) - Due to pollution in the Han river a mutated beast goes on the rampage. The youngest member of the Park family is snatched by the beast, and it is up to the rest of her family to find her, before she becomes the beast's latest meal.Firstly, I love monster movies: Mutated bears, over-sized alligators, packs of ravening Komodo dragons, the whole lot. Creature features are my favourite kind of Horror film. So, I really wanted to like The Host, but it wasn't to be. There were three major problems with it:The first can be seen with a quick look at it's IMDb pageGenre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / ThrillerToo many damned genres. It took itself too seriously to be a comedy, and yet was too light hearted to have any real message (though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement. Anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government). The drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mish-mash with all the other styles.Secondly, after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film. The central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of Korea and America, apparently, do nothing. And that's it, they just wander about, occasionally hitting one another, presumably for a bit of comedy relief. This lack of action made my attention wander, and apparently it did the same for the director, as whole plot threads go unresolved (a mystery plague invented by the evil Americans is completely forgotten about, and is never resolved).And lastly, the film is clumsily political. It paints the Americans as being stupid and evil, but gives us no American characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain. The opening scene has the most obvious stupid American vs wise Korean moment. With a Korean morgue assistant asking his boss, the coroner, not to pour chemicals into the Han river. The American coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on. As well as being racist, it's lazy film-making and there is no excuse for that.On the plus side, the monster is good, kind of a mix of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the movement effects are quite cool, and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun. There are also some nice shots in the film. Some of which remind me, strangely, of the way Firefly was filmed (shuddering cameras, out of focus shots etc).There is also a nice scene at the end, where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the family's mobile food stall. It's night-time and snow is falling, the street-lamp is giving out a cold light, but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it.Overall, I was really disappointed by this film. I'd been looking forward to a decent creature flick, and instead I get some pseudo-political,horror-comedy lite. Looking at the comments on IMDb I can't help but think that if this had been a US production it would have been slated. Just 'cause it's a foreign flick doesn't mean it's any good. There have been some great movies out of Korea in recent years (The vengeance trilogy and Brotherhood, for example), but this certainly isn't one of them. For once I'm in favour of a remake. Tighten up the directing, improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film. As it is, it's not worth a couple of hours of anyone's time.",The Host
292,rainmirror,unpredictable and actually kind of a downer,7,9 April 2007,"Now, I'd seen the trailer for this in San Francisco a couple months ago, and it appeared to be mostly fun. Showing a plot of basically this: giant monster comes out of the water, kidnaps a little girl after wreaking havoc, the government refuses to help, so the family binds together to save her themselves. It kind of billed itself as a horror-comedy-monster movie that for the most part would just be a lot of fun.Well, that's the first half hour or so, but this movie twists... like a knife, in your stomach. I just want to throw that out there; if you get the impression that this is going to be as silly as it starts off, you're just letting your guard down.So I'm going to try and provide a review without any spoilers, because this is easily one of the most unpredictable movies I've ever seen. First of all, the character development is great. The silly onset of the movie actually helps you grow attached to pretty much all of them. The family that the movie centers on is very close, very likable, and chances are, you'll be hoping they all make it to the end of the movie. When tragedy strikes, the government proves even more threatening than the rampaging monster itself, putting the family into quarantine and stating that their beliefs that their little one is still alive is entirely delusion caused by the virus they're allegedly carrying. So they stick together, daringly escape, and go try to save her themselves.Now, a small fraction of time after this, the lighthearted feel of the movie starts to drain right out. There's still jabs at one another in the dialog that spawned laughs in the theater, but the situation gradually becomes more and more serious.Another interesting thing is what a powerful point this movie makes against American involvement in Korea. The opening scene involves an American military officer ordering one of his Korean subordinates to dump bottles of formaldehyde down the drain when the sewer leads into the Han River, and he does this for no reason other than to be a jerk. As it turns out, this is based on an actual event that occurred in 2000, and well, our great nation somehow protected this guy from prosecution. So this winds up causing the mutation that leads to the giant monster in the film. As well, later on in the film, the Americans come in with a chemical called Agent Yellow to try and wipe out the virus while thousands of protesters are aggressively dealt with. I don't even have to pull out the references for that blatant statement.But outside of all that, between the monster, the American government, the Korean government being under its thumb, and the general stress on all the central characters who are barely getting by with their fatigue and hunger trying to make it through this long ordeal, it winds up being completely draining. And I really hate to say the main thing about the movie that bothered me in fear of spoiling it.I was completely gripped from start to finish. At points, I wasn't sure if I loved or hated this movie with the way it was flip-flopping between serious and comical, but towards the last quarter it occurred to me that my attention hadn't strayed once the entire time. It then dealt me a few blows that were so exhausting and not what I had planned for my casual night at the Tower Theater.This is a well made, intriguing, although very uneven picture. I don't think I want to watch it again, for a reason you'll probably get if you see it yourself, but I was definitely involved with it. If you're into monster movies, I say check it out, but just be warned that its not going to be the fun campfest its marketed as; this movie's dense, political, suspenseful, and pretty emotionally heavy.",The Host
293,ivan-259,Much ado about nothing,6,9 December 2006,"I've seen this movie today cause I stumbled upon a website containing the most grossing movies in Korea this year. This one was number 1 on that list. So I became excited wanting to see a mutant beast causing chaos in a town in Korea. Positive points: 1.The special effects are shown in broad daylight, so nothing is hidden. The victims are not who you expect them to be. Negative points: 1. The special effects are sometimes dodgy/bad. 2. The dramatization is too much for its own good. 3. Sometimes scenes are dragged too long. 4. Dialogue is not very good. 5. Characters are mediocre. Nothing new to see here. I hope Korean cinema doesn't carry on like this following cheap Hollywood mutant movies. Long live Oldboy!",The Host
294,gradjanin7,Far superior to anything of even remotely similar genre,10,10 May 2007,"The story, the acting and especially the scene-work were superb. Excellent. There is no ""11"" score on IMDb so I had to give it a mere ""10"".As for the negative reviews: One said that there were too many slow motion scenes - I don't like slow motion also, but I counted two short slow motion scenes in the whole movie. Another said that all the good reviews must be paid for or made by the filmmakers themselves. LOL. I'm from Croatia and never heard of the filmmakers - I watched the movie in an art cinema as we usually get the American crap in the commercial cinemas here.Speaking of which, when the movie finished I remembered all the American SF/fantasy/horror films I watched... Compared to Gwoemul, they were terrible. Terrible!The amount of detail in the movie is overwhelming. The detail ranges from the plot-unimportant to the character-deepening. It is filled with scenes which were chiseled to pure perfection - like a good haiku. The film is also dramatic, action packed, the plot never sags nor is it unbelievable (once the monster premise is established) and is also richly accompanied by funny stuff - some scenes were hilarious, while others were just funny - but not in the shallow American humor style...The movie definitely lacks Hollywood mechanisms (comic relief characters, shallow humor, U.S. clichés...) and so may be unappealing to people who like Hollywood movies (if such exist).Overall: refreshing, exhilarating... simply high quality film-making!",The Host
295,TargetF209,"One of the best ""multi-layered"" movies ever!",9,16 February 2007,"What do I mean by ""multi-layered""? A film that works on a lot of different levels. I have been reading through the message boards on this page and have found subtle references to Korean culture, and to me this is very interesting. The way that, even in a monster movie, people can be taught about Korean culture is very hard to work in I'm sure, but its done very well and for people going into this film with an open mind, it could teach you an awful lot.The film also works on much simpler levels as well, the straight horror theme is very visible, especially in the scenes with the little girl in the sewers. The comedy, very dark in places, had me chuckling quite a few times. And the way in which it portrays America is very bold. The fact that it is an American who orders a Korean to pour Formaldehyde down the sink in the first place is the most obvious relation. But there is also the interrogator who treats Gang-du as a stupid man, and this could reflect the way in which most foreigners feel they are being treated by the American people in most situations.A very exciting, thought provoking and incredibly well made film, there is no excuse for horror/action/comedy fans not to see this. It comes out in the UK on DVD on the 5th March. Be ready to add it to your collection!",The Host
296,Foulmouf,Epic in every kinda way,10,9 August 2007,"Holy smoke! Easily the best movie I've seen so far this year. The movie is based on real happenings that the US government are responsible for, but it tells the story in a adventurous and brilliant kind of way. Maybe that's why it's so underrated on this site? Y'all just can't stand it when a movie isn't about how the USA saves the day? People are using all kind of excuses trying to convince themselves this wasn't that good, but if Michael Bay made this into one of his pro-American franchises people would already have labeled it a classic. Hah, throw in some new school actors from Hollywood, a couple of washed up ones, some crappy side plots and a bunch of cheesy one-liners that belong on ""That 70's Show"" and you got a blockbuster! But no, the Koreans don't threat the viewer like that. I won't give away spoilers but I can say that this as an awesome movie that will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning till end. It fills you with dread, fair, happiness, humor and sadness. It's what I'd like to call a real epic adventure, but if you prefer love stories with some CGI action such as Pirates of The Caribbean and Spiderman you probably won't like this.Great movie!",The Host

Hey, I heard that this movie, 'The Host' was released as R in America. I don't know the specific reason. In Korea, It was PG-13. And, I'm student. So, I watched this movie with my friends. In Korea, This movie is for 'Family', 'Children's Vacation'. And, Director focus on 'Love of one family', not on 'MONSTER'. I saw 'Transformers', 'Harry Potter', 'Lord of The Ring'... Correctly, 'The Host' isn't worse than them. For example, dialog of 'Transformers', 'Now, You are a soldier.', it sounds really childish. But, when I was coming out the theater. I thought 'Umm, It was Funny!' Because I knew that, to this movie, story or writing isn't important and CG and robots are eye-catching ones.I think you guys misunderstood about this movie. This movie is not a decent movie. Not a HORROR movie. It's Family Movie, Human Movie. And, Plus, It's warning about environment. (If you watched movie, you may know that.)

299,Chevassus,"Entertaining, but you'll be confused if you try to follow the plot.",4,5 November 2007,"Seven Thoughts on The Host:First, I couldn't find anything to do with a ""host."" Maybe, ""The Mutant."" Something was definitely off in the translation. Second, do all Korean movies introduce random, yet very essential characters, at the end of the film? Third, I laughed out loud at the very, VERY dry-humored moments, but they contrast greatly with most of the scenes that follow. None of the quotes on the DVD package even hinted that it would be comedy. But if you don't treat it as one, you'll be very disappointed. Fourth, did the makers develop the plot during the process of the film shoot? Fifth, don't watch it dubbed. Switch it to subtitles and let them speak Korean. The movie improves dramatically. Sixth, I'd rent it once, but there's no way in hell I'd buy this. Seventh, The Host reminded me a lot of V for Vendetta--both have their dark moments that are brightened by extremely dry characters, all with a political undertone. Of course V for Vendetta was supposed to be a comic-book style movie... The Host is supposed to be a Thriller/Horror/Monster Movie/Comedy... I still don't know what category to put it under. And neither will you if you really think about it.",The Host

The plot line was incredibly boring and absurd. The performance's were comical, killing any suspense, and the creature was both not scary or intriguing in any shape or form, unless you think a giant shrimp is something to wet your pants over.In all the movie was boring, a labor to sit through and I personally wouldn't suggest any one dignify 5 minutes let alone a couple of hours wasting their time when there are a ""host"" of other movies that can be entertained.I didn't reveal any plot points, because I'm sure there's plenty of you out there who would rather walk through that door anyhow..",The Host
301,DistortedReviews,An overall solid film,8,5 June 2012,"The Plot The Host, directed by Joon-ho Bong is a Korean horror (Monster) film. There are American subtitles through the entire move. It is about a creature that's mutated due to chemicals running into a public river. Done in the classic sci-fi manner of 'doctor/scientist make stupid goof up, and unleash chaos into the world', the resulting monster focuses on attacking and eating it's captives. Gang Du, played by Kang-Ho, is the titular hero of the movie, providing a very down to earth take on the protagonist role. Gang-du helps run a family owned squid and beer stand beach side with his father and daughter. When the creature makes its appearance, wreaking havoc on the beach, the family tries its best in order to rescue Gang Du's daughter. The film is good at keeping the watcher interested. It has comedic relief and is filled with drama, keeping the watcher at the edge of their seats. The story focuses more so on the relationship among the main characters, and their ambition for rescuing Gang Du's daughter.Cinematography The Cinematography is well done. It is easy to see all of the action and they keep the screen very well lit. The monster doesn't look fake and it put into the movie very well. The actors never seem blurry and show up very well. There is also little camera shaking. Watch the first scene of the movie on mute. The dialogue between the two characters feels unnatural. Rely on the images to get the story, and the images in this low key dark comedy monster flick are AMAZING! Everything in this movie supports the story to a 'T' in the imaging department. You can see the progression of the lighting from the introduction of the main character Gang-Doo, which is low contrast even inside the sack which we see later; he very contrasts even in shadows. The lighting compliments the mood of the scene, what we should feel. At the river, things are very bright and seem safe. You barely realize there is a monster running to terrorize the unsuspecting person until it's there and suddenly stuff gets real. There is a shift in lighting ratio, representing the danger by adding contrast. I always wondered why the first scene we see the monster in seems less threatening and very dangerous at the same time. The answer to this, from what I see is that it's lit for comedy. There are moments where at a very serious moment something funny happens. For example Gang-Doo grabs the wrong girl. Although it's funny, it's played serious. There moments in the movie are what make this a great movie.Acting I always find it difficult to really critic acting when they are speaking another language, Korean. First off when watching the movie you are only given a close translation of what they are saying. You don't get to have the exact wording that the actor is using. Another aspect is you must focus on the words at the bottom of the screen, which can also distract you from watching the actors. However, Kang-ho Song did do a very good job. He expressed a lot of emotion and that is very important when I don't know what he is saying. It really helps the watcher understand what is going on. The actors were also good at working with the fake monster to create the allusion that it was really attacking and eating people. There is also an English dubbed version of the film; still the exact translation is not as accurate. Sound From the beginning to the end the sound editing of the entire film was perfectly balanced and well blended. The music, the sound effects and the vocals are clearly heard. The crescendos and decrescendos really add to the suspense in the movie. At the end of the movie the flow of the music lets you know you are at the end of the movie. It really adds to the movie.

302,sams_world_u_know,Funny and Emotional,8,29 October 2015,"I generally don't enjoy Asian Drama Comedy films. I think this is because they often try to blend the emotion with humour. This never works for me. It just leaves me feeling like the tone of the film is inconsistent. I can get emotionally invested in films from other parts of the world that have funny elements but in Asia the comedy is too broad and slapstick for me to enjoy it when placed around such serious emotion scenes. It just feels silly to me. But for whatever reason the Host didn't have that problem for me. I was able to laugh at the jokes and still remain fairly emotionally attached to the characters. I can't for the life me tell you why, but this is the best comedy drama from Asia I've ever seen.",The Host

I am not too acquainted with Korean culture but I have seen several Korean movies before this one and I've greatly appreciated and enjoyed most of them. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about this one. This movie is, at best, a grottesque comedy with irritatingly dumb characters which inspired no sympathy whatsoever in me while watching the pseudo drama roll on... I was in the mood for a good horror/thriller/monster flick, and this was insanely disappointing on every level and from every angle.",The Host

Examples of these are the ""sars-hysteria"" and American movie clichés. But honestly I don't see why people liked this one so much. For one thing I can agree some parts actually were funny, but not in a sense that it makes this one a true comedy. Well, that only leaves the ""drama"" part of the genre left, and for being a ""drama"" this film leaves you unsatisfied. It's just a mostly clichés and other things you've seen many times before.Not everything about this film is completely bad though. The special effects will probably impress you at first, especially in when the monster is seen running around in the park. The soundtrack is not that bad either.my rating: 3/10Cheers.",The Host
306,kammerlader,"watch ""save the green planet""",7,7 August 2006,"as a korean, korean films have always been an interest (no kidding). and here's the thing: you may not agree with me if you're a fan of ""old boy"", ""Gwoemul"", or ""Dongmakgol"": because i didn't like them much. Okay i thought gwoemul had far better content and execution than the other two. i loved the fact that for ONCE, korean cinema had encountered a monster that actually looked alive. the crazy sense of humor and suspense also caught me completely involved, and after the film ended i found myself wanting to come back to see it once more. definitely, it was better than most of the films in korean cinema, and it probably deserves to be called the best korean film of the year 2006 (atleast to date). but honestly, with that CG generated monster looking real and running amok with that likable cast and acting it could've been much, much better.because of it's message and content, ""gwoemul"" inevitably is comparable with ""Save the green planet"". both movies deal with the conflict between those with power and those without power. both movies share the same sardonic sense of wit (despite coming from two different directors..). ""Save the green planet"", however, had much subtler delivery. i felt satisfied: it didn't try to take on some large-scale dilly dallying and stuck with it's sharp, concise manner from start to end. Gwoemul, on the other hand, felt completely out of place. okay you had a good message. but the delivery was that of an ordinary Hollywood blockbuster. lots of people dying, heroic rescues and battles, miraculous recoveries from various injuries, response-provoking scenes that were completely out of sequence, and so on. come on, bong joon ho. we know you could've done much better than that. but for now, i guess i'll stick with jung joon hwan.",The Host

Somebody please explain to me how this even compares with any other monster movie. The acting alone was hard enough to take. Please don't be misled like I was into purchasing this movie. It actually says on the box ""on par with jaws"". Are you kidding me? Believe me i'm into movies like Slither and other movies that aren't meant to be 100% horror or sci-fi but this movie is too uneven. It tries to be silly but the timing is off and it's bad.

308,JongLim,All time number one block buster in Korea,9,3 September 2006,"In just over a month (38 days), this movie set a new record in Korean box office with viewers over 12.4 millions. Personally, I enjoyed the movie because it was a very different kind of scary movie. It was funny, friendly, realistic, emotional, AND very scary.For international viewers outside of Korea, the movie provides a very vivid scenery of the Han River which runs through the heart of Seoul City. The riverbank, bridges, streets, stores, and people are so real and unedited which provides an added contrast to the appearance of the CG created monster which is so much out of this world.After 38 days, the movie is still being shown in theaters within Korea where more than a quarter of the entire population has seen the movie already. Over 200 screens have opened up in Japan this week and news reports say that some 20 countries including US and UK have decided to raise the curtain soon.",The Host
309,ciotti40,The Host,7,26 November 2007,"The Host is by far one of the best monster movies in years. The movie follows a bumbling young father, Gang-Do Park, and his family. The story starts like every monster movie; everything is calm and uneventful, ""business as usual"" you might say. When a mutated fish creature comes along the river bank and begins killing anyone in its path. Amidst all of the confusion, Gang-Do's daughter, Hyun-seo, is picked up by the monster and dragged back to the sewer. The story then turns into a search for Hyun-seo. Gang-Do and his family evade the authorities and use all the money they have to desperately continue their quest.The reason I picked up this movie in the first place is because the box said that it was ""on par with Jaws."" I found this hard to believe but the monster in The Host is the one of the most cinematically pleasing CG creations in recent years and is probably the most original looking monster since Alien. It was legitimately scary looking and had a very unique style of moving that set it apart from previous monsters. Another strength of this monster is how well the CG is done. It does not just look like some computer generated figure spliced into live action footage. It looks like it belongs in the shot. The monster also has enough on screen time to make the movie suspenseful. The movie keeps the viewer wanting to see more of the monster while, at the same time, keeping them satisfied with the number of appearances.The Park family does a pretty good job of keeping the audience entertained while the monster is off screen. The relationship that Gang-Do shares with his father, ""college man"" brother, and professional archer sister maintains a balance of drama and humor that the audience can appreciate. This dynamic seems strange but the movie makes it work. You start to really feel like these people are family. The best thing about these characters is that you are not disappointed when they are on the screen. Some monster movies seem to get kind of boring when the monster is off screen (Godzilla 1998).The weakest thing about this movie, as it is with most foreign films, is the English translation and dubbing. After a while it becomes bearable but in the beginning it sounds absolutely awful. I don't say this very often because, like many Americans, I hate reading subtitles. But I think this one time I would have made the exception because the voice acting was just terrible. They just didn't seem to fit the characters very well. The dialogue in some scenes is very awkward as well. Some of the English translation just sounds out of place. This happens a lot with language barriers, however, and sometimes it just cannot be helped. If you want to watch something that is not meant to be in your language, you've just got to go with what you get.I started off saying that this is one of the best monster movies in years, and it is. It's not perfect, but what monster movie is? It has some flaws but the originality of the monster and the simplicity of the plot makes this movie very easy to follow and worth watching at the very least. It is pretty good for what it is. The whole ""monster terrorizing an Asian town"" seems like it has been done a million times (because it has), but this movie has some new things to offer. Would I call this movie ""on par with Jaws""? I wouldn't personally, but it is definitely better than some of the cheesy messes that monster movies have made in the past.",The Host
310,myprecious1016,The Best Korean Movie Ever,10,28 July 2006,"I am currently living in South Korea, and, being an avid movie-goer, I was very, very excited for Gwoemul (The Host).Since the expectations were very high among Koreans, I was just a bit worried that people will not get what they want and this movie would come off screen sooner than expected.However, as the movie played in front of me, all my worries were wiped clean.In the former Korean movies, the special effects were nowhere near Hollywood. This movie breaks the trend. The monster that comes out of the Han River is actually there: you hear it breathe, you see in run, and people interact with it.As the story lays itself out, it tells the audience this is not simply a monster movie where heroes kill the monster and save the day. Very emotional and psychotic themes are displayed. This movie even goes on to criticize the current social issues of Korea, the exclusion of people in poverty from society.Gwoemul, meaning ""monster"" in the Korean language, is unlike anything else people have seen. This monster has no name like Godzilla or King Kong. It's just ""monster"". You can really never figure out what this monster is. And it is also a poor sacrifice of modern society.This movie will please you, no matter what. It is for both the brains and the fun. Funny sequences, put in just at the right time, relieve you when there is too much tension that builds up. Emotional scenes are cleverly done and will grasp your feelings for characters. And the monster, the Gwoemul, will shock you. You better hold onto that popcorn tight, and have a box of Kleenex ready...",The Host

There are many hidden agendas like biological warfare, society biasness on gender, imperialism, radicalism and censorship featured in The Host. Although initially it looks like the movie is taken from an Ultraman series, The Host does set viewers' mind racing.

I immediately said, ""PICK A GENRE!"" I mean come on, was it a comedy? A horror flick? A drama? It was stupid. The only reason i gave it a 5 out of 10 was because the CGI of the monster was pretty good. The music was just bad. It didn't match the movie at all. When the credits roll, it sounded like Bar-mitzvah music! It just didn't compliment the film at all. I was severely disappointed by the movie. I have seen a bunch of great Japanese films and this Korean one doesn't compare to them. I looked the ""big executives"" right in the eye and told them, ""This movie will not fly in the United States."" After all the hype of Snakes on a Plane, it bombed in the box-office. The same thing would happen with ""The Host"". I DO NOT recommend you waste ten dollars on this movie. Hopefully this poor excuse for a movie wont ever be released in the US. That would save our brains a load of pain. Don't get me wrong, i am not one of those typical American movie-goers that groan when subtitles come onto the screen.

317,mercercheng,Crapfest,1,25 September 2006,"Awful movie. Shudder worthy, and not in a good scary way. The plot had such huge gaping holes most of the movie didn't make any sense. The symbolic nature of the fishy monster as 'terrorism' or 'war' was a pathetically simple and obvious one, and basically they should never have made a movie on a subject matter they didn't really understand. Where the plot depends on this 'deep and meaningful' idea to be heartfelt, the story did nothing to help it. If there were an actual storyline that made much sense. The whole idea of war/terrorism/misinformation as the fishy monster that is created by the American scientist at the beginning again is way too obvious, and the portrayal of Americans are quite appalling still, although I suppose it's no different than US movies with Chinese/Russian/insert ethnic group 'villains'. The addition of the American army guy as a 'hero' was so stupidly done it was painfully obvious this army guy (who looked NOTHING like an army guy, without the shaved head, the body, and some form of functioning brain - who throws a tiny brick at a 10 ft tall 'monster' and expect that to hurt it?) was included so not to appear Anti-American. But I suppose it was the only thing I chuckled at throughout the movie - the stupid American trying to help and getting swallowed by the fishy. Hee. And ultimately, there was no plot/character development at all! The entire family we're supposed to care about were immensely annoying throughout(and no, stupidity and the whole love your family mentality does not equal heartwarming and comic relief. It's nails on a chalkboard) and you find yourself rooting for the fishy to take over the world if it meant this story without any plot would stop. Oh, and how exactly did that guy and the kid survive at the end? I thought the 'Agent Yellow' kills, and it's weird that they were all still running around while others are dying in the fumes. At around 2 hours, don't you just wish the fishermen at the beginning of the movie had actually killed the fishy(at an infant stage at that time, apparently) then so no one would have to sit through this nasty piece of film?",The Host

The redeeming factor is that the girl doesn't get rescued after all  and now I have spoiled it for you! All in all it is a well-made movie, about 20 minutes too long (it failed the gluteus maximus test) and lacks focus.By the way, a lot of the movie takes place in sewers, and it seems to be absolutely peeing down most of the time, yet those sewers are not running with water  how so Bong?

It came with a simple set of guidelines-1.Dont show your monster fully till the end 2.It doesn't matter if your monster sucks, as long as the movies scary.The Host changes everything. It begins like Jaws, but turns into the greatest Monster movie ever made. It shows its beast fully, and what a beast. The monster is the most spectacular creature ever imagined for cinema. And opposite to JAWS, the special effects are awe-inspiring, let down only by the fiery finale. The Host's Monster is terrifying and almost surreal, but it has its own character as well. Its not just an eating machine, its a clever, evil, killing machine that actually thinks about how and what it will kill.But what truly separates this masterpiece from every other monster movie is its human, emotional storyline. Although there are funny moments, most of the time you'll be ever screaming or crying. Yes, you will cry in this movie. As the plot deepens, we feel attached to the human characters, unlike over Monster flicks in which humans are just there to be eaten. We feel sympathy for the creatures victims. The films deep underlying messages are satirical and sometimes even cause an uneasy laugh.

It's a simple story about the horrors of ecological damage and the havoc it can wreak on mankind and on a more intimate level, your family. Moreover, it's a movie about the struggles of a normal and somewhat dysfunctional family in a time of extreme crisis (flesh-eating gutter beast).It's not a masterpiece but it's fun and the acting is excellent across the board. It's not deep material and any statements it makes about the environment are broad and not meant to be taken seriously; just roll with it and you'll find it highly entertaining.

I am very picky viewer, especially about horror and sci-fi flicks because of the recent awful horror flicks of our time, but this one did not disappoint me.

326,nurserator,Review: Monster,9,1 April 2007,"Synopsis: This movie is about a monster that gets created because some American dude made some other Korean dude dump some sort of toxic chemical into the Han River. After a few years a squid mutates and then goes about terrorizing the people around the Han River. The story follows a dysfunctional family who lives in a concession stand by the Han River. The grandfather, Hyun soo, the grand daughter, along with her father, Gang Doo try their best to get by. The story picks up when the Monster Squid comes out of the water and starts owning. In the end of the sequence the monster kidnaps and seemingly eats Hyun Soo. This begins a series of events that brings together Gang Doo's brother, Nam Il, a unemployed graduate, and his sister, Nam Joo whose an Olympic bronze medalist in archery. The family gets quarantined by the military because they suspect that the monster has some sort of virus.One night Gang Doo receives a call from Hyun Soo somewhere in a sewer. He then goes to tell the authorities who only believe he's insane, a symptom of the virus. As a result the family escapes and takes the matter into their own hands and go on a hunt for the monster and save Hyun Soo.Why You Should See It: Simply put, this movie is the dream and any person who likes movies or the entertainment industry in general should see this movie. It doesn't do anything new but it does everything so well. It ties together multiple layers of questions ranging from simple nuances from the family all the way to government superstructures. In the end the product is one that will make you think and re consider this movie on many different levels making you want to watch it over and over again.Things to Watch Out For: The main idea of the movie isn't really about killing the monster or finding Hyun Soo. It's about questioning society and human nature. Making us think about who the real monsters are. So as you are watching this movie pay close attention and really try to think about what the director/writer is trying to convey. If you pay close enough attention you will slowly begin to see how this movie makes us question all aspects of society and ourselves and seeing that there is a monster in everything. The sub theme of this movie is getting a second chance which is pretty clear and it does give the movie a nice circular feeling as the ending strongly resembles the beginning and does well in tying together the character development as well as the main plot.Things You Don't Expect: This isn't a horror movie as the trailers would have you believe. Hell it's a boarder line thriller. So don't go watch it if you're expecting a scare fest. And it's rated 14A which means there is no gore, no violence and definitely no nudity. It might be a bummer for some, but if you want to watch a movie with all the things this one doesn't' have then just wait until April 6th when you can pay a visit to the Grind House.Final Score 9.0",The Host

The movie had everything going for it, that's how I got suckered in. A cool monster, social commentary, and rave reviews. After seeing this flick, I wondered if the previous reviewers that had praised this one had even seen the same movie as me. The ""monster's terror"" consisted of running around a park and tackling random stuff. The characters hurt my head. Besides all being idiots, what kind of development was there? The drunk brother was kinda cool, but that's not much. And what the hell was up with the father's ""retard-invincibility"" powers. Because he was a trauma victim, apparently deadly nerve gas can't kill him? And how he got whisked away to be tortured in a hospital for the random middle part of the movie? Is there some kind of Korean sense of unstoppable motivation? WTF is going on? And no offense, but let's not forget the stereotypical Asian resolution. The guy, who's inconsolably raging to find his daughter, finally gets her back, she suddenly dies, and he could care less. I guess he was happier to adopt the random homeless boy. And isn't that what's really important? Having a boy instead of a girl in that part of the world? I'm not being racist, that's how they ended the damned thing.This movie was a mess, I kept waiting for redeeming value, and it never came. It's not a comedy, It's not a horror movie.

To call this a horror movie it's a huge stretch. My 5 years old would say that the Ninja Turtles are real monsters by comparing it with this big fish who can run on the streets and has a rat tail.The Host, however, tries without success to offer a little bit of everything a little bit of sci-fi horror, a little bit of drama, a little bit of action, and a little bit of comedy.

I especially enjoyed a lot of the action going on in the day time b/c the creature was visible, active and you could see a lot of the action instead of the action happening at night, in the dark, unseen. My only problem with this movie was that although this creature was reeking havoc the locals did not seem to do much about it. Something of this magnitude, I would have expected more from the people, but all in all the movie is still an excellent watch.",The Host
330,erik-657,Severely disappointing: this movie hardly deserves it's mountain of praise.,2,3 June 2007,"What this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie. Unfortunately with disjointed storytelling, frustrating plot-holes, and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly ""the greatest monster movie ever."" Let's start with the good stuff: comedy, acting and special effects. From the get-go, this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky. The opening scene - the monster's origin - is campy and quick, paying homage the the classic 'environmental' disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters. The pacing is fast, which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action. With in the course of 10 minutes you get the 'why', 'where,' and 'how' of the beast and are ready for action. In this the movie delivers.After another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced: the lazy son and his precocious little girl, kind grandfather, and talented sister (aunt) and, of course, the monster. The characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent, allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work. The monster it's self looks great: alien yet familiar - kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid. The effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you 'see it's strings.' Even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar, like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd, slipping on surfaces, crushing and eating those in it's path. When the monster's path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment, and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie's appeal begins to unravel.Following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity. Plot-lines are introduced, then abandoned, characters change their position for no apparent reason, and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent, while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random. As for the comedy, let me say this: I'm willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural. I am not familiar with Korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation. However, as an Asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in Japan for the last 5 years (still here) I'd like to think I have a better grasp on Asian humor than the average white-guy. That being said there were many parts of the movie that I understood were supposed to be funny, but, to me, weren't. *********** SPOILER************* For example: after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral; everyone is mourning. A new character is introduced - a brother - and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another. They both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder. This competition is, at it's core, funny: two brothers who dislike each-other so much they even compete at a funeral - it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in Asian comedy. This subtle slap-stick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but, seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl. ************** END SPOILER **************Then come the plot holes. there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained, or, worse, are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end. Finding out an obstacle isn't an obstacle can be a good thing for a character, but you'd expect some comment to that nature. Instead the audience is barraged by moments of anti-climax when problems just 'aren't there' anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start. So I ask you: why even bring it up in the first place? This was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems, and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other. Of course introducing new and greater problems is a time-tested story telling tradition, but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead it was as if you get several stories, each only explained 20% of the way and, in the end, the parts never converge to complete the whole.Again, I'm willing to accept that a lot of this might be 'cultural.' Maybe its in Korean story- telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy. Maybe it's normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every-page, but never finishes one. Maybe it's OK to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis. Or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.",The Host

Well, this is one of those movies. From the very opening scene of this very average import the story makes no sense & is not entertaining. The plot is fairly easy to follow, girl gets kidnapped by creature, relatives search, so on & so forth, but the cartoon-like plot twists are not necessary and drag the story down to a being a joke. Very close to ""Ichi the Killer"" theatrics. The creature is never really explained, and the government involvement is more like a moviemaker's statement against real life authorities than a true part of the storyline. It just doesn't make sense. Although this is Korean, it's basically like every Japanese horror you've ever seen. I must comment that the creature FX are great as well as the whole cinematography of the film, but wasted on a lame storyline. A pity!!If you're interested in a far better experience try ""Hiruko the Goblin"" (great spider creature film), or ""Evil Dead Trap"".",The Host

I just wasted 2 hours of my life viewing this crap-fest. the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple times. after about 15 minutes it no longer entertained. the dialogue was terrible, must be a translation thing. another negative that stood out was the idiot Americans. 3 were portrayed and they were all lacking character, intelligence and judgment.

The characters each have distinct issues, and there exists a tension but togetherness in the family that is all too realistic. The plot line is disjoint, but is superbly executed -- the story weaves around character to character and subplot to subplot getting increasingly disjoint until the final scenes.The monster in the movie is excellently portrayed, and at no stage did I empathise, anthropomorphise, or predict the actions or intentions of it.

While there were some scary moments, there were more slapstick moments.The actors playing the grandfather and the little girl were the most believable in their parts. Everyone else was either predictable or a cardboard cutout.The monster has some good special effects and is far above the old rubber monster movies, but the rest of the movie isn't. They did avoid having a completely predictable ending in some ways.There are a few ""agh!"" moments that will make you jump, and some gross-out scenes that in a different movie (say, Alien) would have had power, but in this movie they're a waste.Parents, be aware there's a lot of strong language.

336,chunizzle_foshizzle,Is a Good Movie,8,15 October 2009,"This is a good movie, and it's definitely worth watching. OK, sure, the fact that the monster was born from a mixture of H2CO+river water doesn't really make sense, but you guys are forgetting it's a SCI-FI movie. And in my opinion, I would label this an ""action/thriller,"" and not really a horror movie--but that's only in the American sense. Because to a Korean (yes, I'm Korean) ""horror"" is more like The Grudge (using American movie for reference only). So obviously these movies are completely different. But either way, labels aside, it's a good, entertaining movie. The end was kind of bad (and I think it was only made that way to set it up for the sequel), but still I really enjoyed looking at the fish-monster, and I thought the bow-and-arrow chick was gnarcore!!! It was simply a fun movie to watch.And again, the movie doesn't have to make sense since it's SCI-FI. I mean, it's not like we sit and watch Star Wars and ask where every single alien-thing came from. And it's not like I'm saying that something can just pop-up out of nowhere, since that's not what this movie's about...but still, everything in this movie made perfect sense to me: The monster was created by us humans, and now it came to attack us, and we had to kill it. What's so hard to get???? The acting was NOT bad, and the effects were great.And I think what makes this movie most worth watching is the symbolism. Bong Joon-Ha (the director) is known for his ""in-between the lines"" metaphors, and hidden messages. And to me, personally, movies that have those ""secret,"" hidden, deep messages are the best ones to watch, because they entertain without bombarding you with personal bias. Anyway...it's definitely worth watching. And I would consider it an action movie, which I think helps if you've never seen it, because then you're not expecting to be scared. I'm fully awaiting the sequel, and I hope it's as good as this.",The Host

This is a political movie cast with the appearance of a monster movie. The real question is who is the real monster. Inside of this, is a glimpse into the life of real Koreas as contrasted with the public presentation of the Korean government?

338,hjk327,Comments on New York Times review (Korean Perspective),10,22 December 2010,"In her review of ""The Host,"" Manohla Dargis does not fully explain why it was such a popular movie in Korea. One of the biggest reason is that the setting of this movie is the Han River. The Han river has a long national history. The reason Seoul has been the capital of Korea for hundreds of years is also because of the Han river's significant advantages due to its geological location. Even today, the Korean government is working on the 'Han River Renaissance' project making the area into a place of art representative of all Korea combining Korea's high technological modernism with the natural beauty of the Han river itself. Moreover, half of the whole Korean population resides in or near Seoul and encounters the Han river in their daily life. The Han river provides peaceful and relaxing shelter for busy and tired Korean citizens, so creating this haunting monster in such river patently brings huge interest and anxiety to Koreans. This greatly contributed to the immediate success of the film as it appeared in the theaters of Korea.In addition, there are some perspectives of Koreans toward Americans which is featured in this movie that the author of this review does not go through. This movie is based on the incident in 2000 when workers on an American military base actually dumped formaldehyde down the drain. This implied America's carelessness toward the effects of their activity on the environment of the local area, only caring about their own interests. This increased the anti-American sentiment in Korea. Furthermore, in June of 2002, the military armed vehicle struck and killed two 14 year old girls near the American military base in Korea. The American soldiers tried to evade the responsibilities which made Korean citizens outraged. This led to an enormous strike against the American military base and army in Korea. These factors also apparently influenced the director's will of criticizing the Americans and reminding the Koreans of such unforgettable incident which appeared as one of the major themes in the movie.This movie, however, not only rebukes the practices of American military in Korea, but also behavior of Korean citizens. In the scene where the monster with prehensile tail first appears, Gang-du throws a can of beer in the river and the creature takes the can into the water. Interested by the scene, all the tourists who are around him start throwing all the trash and food they have into the water without any hesitation. This exhibits the reckless behavior of Koreans ignoring the environmental issue due to a tempting interest.Another major theme sticks to the idea of strong family bond in Korea. In Korea, not many Koreans stand completely independently from their parents even after they marry. They have developed an incredibly strong family bond through the country's history. This is also well shown in the movie. When the girl, Hyun-seo, is kidnapped by the creature, the whole family escapes out of the hospital to save the girl not even concerned with the consequences they might face in the end. They even go against the government and sell everything they have only to save the girl. In one scene, the grandfather of the girl sacrifices his life in order to help save the girl. As a result, this movie effectively illustrates the unbreakable family tie in Korean society.Lastly, Dargis points out that if the ending of this movie had been a happy ending, it would have become even more popular. This statement, however, is true only in America. There is a reason why all the popular movies filmed in Korea have distorted endings, never completely happy endings. Koreans tend to be more attracted by the touching and lugubrious endings which live in their heart for a long time even long after they finish the movie. That is one way how a movie becomes popular and well known in Korea; by people's word of mouth as a kind of advertising.",The Host
339,bs-961-219421,They tried too much and gave too little,3,27 January 2011,"Firstly as with most foreign films the Host was a subtitled film which I am sure puts a lot of people off before the film even starts - like it does with me. Never the less I gave it a shot as it had a fairly good mark on IMDb and I'm fairly open-minded with filmsI will always give credit where its due, The Host did start off fairly good and has you gripped right at the start. Unfortunately this wan't the case for the rest of the film, personally I thought it was a shambles! To me when you have a horror film such as The Host where people are getting killed by a huge terrifying monster, comedy as a big NO. Don't get me wrong, comedy is greatly accepted in the right context but if your town is in jeopardy by a huge man eating monster - I for one wouldn't be cracking jokes or acting the goat! They also failed on the acting and special effects, we don't expect Korean films to be the best ground breaking films ever, but for a film to be worthwhile, the acting clearly needs to be fairly high standard and in my view this is not the case in The Host. The special effects also let it down, although not all of the time. The Monster looked fairly good but its other little bits that look too CGI that let the film down.On a plus side the plot of the film wasn't all bad news, they just failed to deliver on everything else that mattered.Overall I gave the film a 3/10. If your not too bothered about subtitles, bad acting & special effects and a lack of gore then its maybe worth the watch, but its not for me.Acting:4/10 Plot:6/10 Special effects:3/10 Gore: 3/10",The Host

The movie requires some knowledge of Korean affairs and recent history. There was an actual case of the US Army dumping chemicals into the Han River. The government has on many occasions involved itself in all sorts of cover ups, often with the US involved such as the two wee long no comment on the two schoolgirls who were killed by a US army armored vehicle in 2002.

Even if you're able to ignore the heavy handed anti-USA political subtext, the rest of the plot is just irritating. The entire family of protagonists started off a bit quirky but funny while together, then deteriorated into a complete mess of individualized and decidedly not funny arcs before the movie hit the halfway point. The writers decided somewhere along the line, it'd be better to introduce two brand new characters and save one of them instead of the kid who was literally the focus of the entire plot.

344,kyungho,Breaths new life in a tired genre.....,8,7 November 2006,"I caught this film at the AFI Fest in West Los Angeles. I've been following it for awhile and needless to say expectations were high. Many of my expectations were met. The computer creature effects were amazing and very good despite the limited budget of this move (small by Hollywood standards at $14M). It was weaker at the end, but given how strong they were throughout the movie, it was more then forgivable. The monster moves (great biomechanics) well, interacts with the environment, wonderfully textured, etc. In my opinion, the monster looks better then the ape in King Kong, a movie with a much bigger budget.This is different then most monster movies in the it makes political and social comments in satirical settings. For the most part, these are done well and are even funny on many occasions. I don't know how well this would translate to a Western audience as monster movie goers generally don't like to learn about politics. However, South Korea's democracy is relatively new and even as early as 12 years ago, movies were strictly censored for political content. Korean directors are exercising a freedom they have only recently been given, so that is understandable.I had a problem with the ending as it appears that the movie was building on something but it didn't 100% deliver. I think the director was trying to avoid the typical Hollywood ending, but I believe this family needed something resembling that climatic, feel good ending. It's not to say that the ending was disappointing. No, not at all. The direct must be applauded for trying something new and different, something that Hollywood has more often then not forgotten.There are things about this movie that translate rather nicely. The South Korean distrust of government is understandable to a post-Watergate, post-Vietnam era America. The overbearing attitude of America shown in this movie can be understood by many who see the post 9/11 Bush administration and the Neocons as such also.The Host has been slated for remake and I believe that if a competent Hollywood director takes it on, it can actually be a better, tighter, movie.

Why is the movie called The Host? The monster is not a host of anything. The main character is a bumbling fool and not even likable. What happened to the American doctor at the beginning of the show?

So i want to talk about it.There's a family that operates a small snack bar on Han river. It looks like ordinary times. KangDu(who is the main character and Hyunseo's father)is sleeping. But suddenly, something appears in the river. It was taking pictures of people. and it was stretching its body. It is a monster which has made toxic chemicals from the U.S. army. It kills people and eats them. Everyone is in a panic. Then, they are running away from the Han river. KangDu is running away with Hyunseo,too. But he missed her hand. She was eaten by the monster. After the monster hid away, there was a joint funeral.Every member of KangDu's family came for HyunSeo. There are HeeBong, who is KangDu's father, NamIl and NamJu who are KangDu's younger broter and sister. They sob in front of Hyunseo's picture. And the journalists keep taking pictures of them for their benefit. The government authorities can't explain this situation. The bereaved family don't know why those who were loved had died, and don't know why they had to die. The government kept them away from the answer. They just told them ""We can't explain. Because we don't have much time. So watch TV."" But there's no TV which report accurate information. So they press the government. Then the government gets into a corner and isolates them. At the same time, the news announces the Virus only and the other nations believe that only. And then, the TV shows a U.S. soldier as a 'Hero' who was ""made"" the monster.KangDu called his daughter. So told the government about this. But they ignored him and they even threatened him. At the pressing situation, we are barbarians to them. The only way of survival is with her family. They take decisive action escape the isolation. A company which help them to escape aimed at the money. They paid everything, and they were broke. At that time, the news announced KangDu's family escaped everywhere. On the TV news, they were treated like dreadful criminals. That means the Assailant becomes the Hero, and the Victims become the Assailants. The government and the press chased the family, not a monster. They went to the Han river to save Hyunseo. In that situation, the private enterprise paid the government workers. The government workers aim at the money, not the rescue. Now, the family is fighting with an invisible enemy. When the government protections crumbled, other victims appeared. The nation let the people alone.When they(the family) have a late dinner, they imagine being with her. They miss the ordinary times. Finally, they meet the monster. They are fighters with guns who were normal people before. The soldiers get near them because of the gun shot. But in the end, Heebong passed away because of the monster. At that moment, they run away from the nation and the world feels pity for the U.S. soldier's death, not their father's. The family members who chased the monster fall down one by one.Actually, there was no virus. The government wasted time, during that period so many people were dying.HyunSeo is tired, so she decides to escape herself. But eventually she was swallowed by the monster. When the family found her, she already died. After all, the monster died. But the last time, only the family fought the monster.The time passes. Now, KangDu can't sleep and he always feels nervous. The TV still shows stupid news, and the news is of no value.P.S.)

There isn't any suspense, since its made quite clear from the get go that an old kiosk owner, his bum of a son, a college kid, or even an experienced archer are cut out for minibus-sized-monster fighting. This is not the kind of movie where the power of love or the indomitable human spirit wins out against a bloody great fish frog rat thing, rendered in CG that I doubt was up to scratch even in 2006.But the crucial thing is that this family is not stupid. They are human. A lesser movie would have played up their failures and made an out and out slapstick comedy, and that lesser movie would have been better for it. As is, while there are some legitimately quite entertaining moments, you can't muster up the snide superiority to laugh at their misfortunes, because it's not like you would have done any better. There is no suspense and there is no comedy, and those are the essential ingredients in any genre movie.There is still a lot to like about ""The Host."" When it's funny, it's funny. Despite looking about as realistic as the aliens from classic Doctor Who, the creature has a really interesting and original design (I read somewhere it was based off Steve Buscemi's character in Fargo, which is a horribly unflattering homage). There are stabs at satire, including an opening where an American scientist orders the disposal of an entire laboratory's worth of toxic chemicals into the Han river with the line, ""the Han river is very broad, let's try to be broad minded about this."" However the satire never becomes the main focus and we the audience are stuck with an un-engaging and un-amusing tale of a family struggling and failing to rescue one of their own.In short, while there is a lot to like, it's just kinda boring, just kinda slow, and just kinda bad.",The Host
354,sniperizbak,Good movie - interesting but lack of focus,7,14 April 2008,"After seeing a few horror movies and the huge success of Cloverfield, I returned to my blockbuster when The Host just grabbed me like a virus. I love foreign horror and action films, such as BR, Ringu, Dark Water, Audition, etc. I thought that this film was Japanese at first but shortly found out later that it was Korean, no big deal on with the film.The movie begins very strangely with an American mortician and Korean mortician conversing about these dirty bottles of formaldehyde. The American mortician orders the Korean to empty these dirty bottles into the sink that leads into the Han river. Two years later a monster is born, and a few years after that it terrorizes the city.The monster was definitely well designed. It did not have the features of a horror monster but more a long the lines of cloverfield monster meets a rodeo. However, the times that the monster attacks the city seem very sub par of a monster flick, in the sense that the monster seems to do absolutely no damage. It's main kill move is pretty much just running and accidentally flailing into people. I would rather have seen more of the monster eating people because that was definitely a feature of the monster that was ridiculously cool. There were no fangs or teeth, just tentacles that seemed to suck people up very slowly.The story itself shows a family of five. The main character, a sleepy dimwit (who lacks protein - I laughed at that part), his daughter who gets kidnapped by the monster, his father (an old geezer who owns a food stand and buys his way out of everything), his brother (a college graduated who cant find a job and becomes an alcoholic), and his sister (a national archery master whose one weakness is her slow reaction time).Interestingly enough, the movie has very deep character development and each character is defeated by their weakness and then overcomes it in order to save the main character's daughter. The main character overcomes his dimwittedness, the brother overcomes the idea that everything should come to him since he is a college graduate, and the sister overcomes her slow reaction time with precision. However, the movie takes a weird tole during the middle in which the family is portrayed as this odd bunch. Don't get me wrong this part was extremely hilarious, but I would rather this film be more focused on its action-drama setting.There is also a major plot point of the government controlling the family and the city with this made-up idea that the monster is delivering a virus. Although we learn that the virus doesn't really exist, it shows that the real monster of the movie (or antagonist) is not the creature, but the government itself. And in the end it is not the government who succeeds in bringing down the creature, its these ""infected"" individuals who overcome their self-inhibitions for a common goal of saving a little girl.The ending is pure dramatic with an anime-magna style finish to the creature similar to Dragonball-Z, Cowboy Bebop, and Trigun. Consider it to be like the ultimate finish in which the surviving characters of the family work together (but individually) to bring the monster down. And they do it without dialogue (such as hey You do this kinda crap), which actually makes it enjoyable. And with the monster defeated - a sharp twist comes at the end but does not leave you with a bad taste. The movie has a happy ending but something different than what we expected which is fresh in the world of movies with twists today.The one thing that will bother you about this movie however, is a sense of time-line. More often than not some parts seem to last days and when we return to another part - it really should have only been a couple of hours to make the movie believable. It's minor and easily just forgotten if you remember that time is not a feasible thing in this movie and just go with whatever flow it throws at you.Overall - its a good movie, the plot is solid and the character development is key. If you don't root for the family in this movie then you really are a morbid person. But this movie has flaws. If the movie was more focused on the drama-action, and kept the comedic parts to the beginning it would have been solid and easy to follow. Also the monsters action scenes (minus the ending) just seem lacking in supreme action entertainment. Good movie, definitely recommend watching.",The Host

356,spencery,Mindblowing giant monster soon-to-be CLASSIC!!!,10,19 October 2006,"I just saw ""The Host"" at the Chicago International Film Festival along with a full house, and was blown away by the best giant monster movie I've ever seen. I was expecting cheap effects a la ""Mothra"", maybe a couple of guys underneath a dirty carpet that has eyeballs taped to it...OH MAN WAS I WRONG!!! The effects in ""The Host"" were the most realistic I've ever seen on the big screen...the creature even exuded a personality beneath it's vicious exterior. This monster is never hidden or ""parted out"" as cheap Hollywood is prone to do, but is allowed to dominate the frame and flawlessly interact (read: eat) with the human actors running for fear of their lives. To my eyes the recent remake of ""King Kong"" employed a title character that looked robotic and ""unreal"" at times along with some flawed CGI effects, but the bus-sized pit-bull meets land-shark mutant of ""The Host"" never once failed to amaze me with it's completely realistic presence. The opening scene of this creature in action on a wild ravenous romp through hundreds of terror-stricken people fleeing for their lives is completely original and eye-popping. This film is shot gorgeously and looked beautiful. Director Bong Joon-ho has an eye for deep rich shots, juxtaposing steel and concrete with foliage and water, and employs some of the same motifs (cascades of raindrops gently floating towards the ground, a life-threatening force lurking within the natural beauty of the surrounding environment, water as an elemental archetype permeating almost every frame) he used in his previous movie ""Memories of Murder"". The main characters of ""The Host""...a dysfunctional family seeking revenge on the beast...are well-written and easy to root for in their battle against forces beyond their control. This movie combines comedy with drama and jaw-dropping action, yet is also a very dark flick without an easy ending. Yet it all comes back to the creature: I cannot get some of the wild scenes of monster mayhem out of my mind after seeing this amazing film. If you are a monster-movie fan, do yourself a favor and check this flick out the first chance you can...I can guarantee you won't be able to wipe the grin off your face. I can't wait to own this one on DVD!!! Pure entertainment.",The Host
