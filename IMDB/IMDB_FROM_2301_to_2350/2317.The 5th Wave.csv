0,TheLittleSongbird,Fighting for humanity,3,28 August 2018,"Saw 'The 5th Wave' because the concept was a good one, there was interest in how survival, alien invasion and teenage romance would work together and because there is talent in the cast. Was determined not to let my apprehension, as to whether 'The 5th Wave' would execute its good concept well (having seen so many potential wastes recently), get the better of me. It is a shame that after genuinely wanting to like it, not with the intention to hate it or want to, that 'The 5th Wave' was yet another potential waste, executing its good idea very ordinarily. Not one of the worst cases but one of the most infuriating ones, not irredeemably awful but the cons outweigh the pros and the cons are hardly big in size. It is not that it didn't try, to me it tried too hard, executing its elements underwhelmingly and they just don't go together.There are a few good things. Chloe Grace Moretz gives it everything, a very committed performance and comes off well compared to everything else. In fact, a good deal of the cast are game.Production design has some atmosphere and while the effects are variable a few are above so-so, credit is due for not overusing and abusing them that it became a CGI-fest. The start does intrigue.Conversely, the camera work and editing were wanting, being far too drab and hasty-looking rather than dynamic. Other effects are artificial-looking. The direction showed someone not at ease with the material and one finding it difficult to control it. While Moretz and the lead cast are game, the children are inept.The dialogue is clunky and excessively cheesy, particularly in the teenage/romantic scenes. It was the story execution that was particularly underwhelming about 'The 5th Wave'. There was not enough at stake for the survival/end-of-the-world element to work, it was too predictable, a lot could be seen from a mile away, and urgency and tension were missing. The alien-invasion parts suffered from a lack of thrills, no suspense and less than menacing villains. The teenage/romantic elements are just awkward and bog the film down, placed inappropriately at times too. On top of neither element being executed well, they don't go well together, coming over as a muddled jumble of tones and cobbled together storytelling, with every recycled, fatigued cliché imaginable with nothing new done with either. The twists were obvious and didn't really feel like twists, the big one not excepted. The characters were generally bland with their development at best sketchy. The ending is sheer nonsense and impossible to take seriously. Also have felt that open-ended ones hinting at a follow-up are rather risky in case that falls through, watching 'The 5th Wave' did nothing to change my mind on this.In conclusion, not awful but there are a lot of issues here. 3/10 Bethany Cox",The 5th Wave
1,Leofwine_draca,Another trite young adult adaptation,4,20 December 2017,"THE 5TH WAVE is another in an endless wave of young adult novel adaptations based on a futuristic sci-fi premise. It's very much in the line of THE HUNGER GAMES, DIVERGENT, and THE MAZE RUNNER in terms of look and feel, mixing teenage anxiety problems and emotions with a wide-ranging plot. This one's about an alien invasion staged in waves to gradually destroy mankind. The continuously irritating Chloe Grace Moretz plays a kid who joins up with some woodland rebels in order to fight back. Along the way you get Hollywood stars picking up their paycheques (hello, Liev Schrieber and Mario Bello), some absolutely soul-destroying teenage crush romance, some CGI effects, and a trite script. Moretz's look of wide-eyed shock becomes tiresome very quickly and the film's big twists are extremely obvious from the outset. It's another bore, in other words.",The 5th Wave
2,SnoopyStyle,good start but flounders,4,4 June 2016,"Cassie Sullivan (Chloë Grace Moretz) is a normal high school girl when aliens arrive on Earth. They are referred to as The Others. They unleash four devastating attacks to destroy humanity. The first is an electromagnetic pulse. The second is a worldwide tsunami. The third is a deadly modified avian flu. Cassie and her family join a group of refugees. They are told to evacuate by the military. Her little brother Sam leaves on the bus. Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber) claims the fourth wave is parasites infesting humans and taking over. The military massacres everybody else but Cassie escapes. She is shot and rescued by Evan Walker. Meanwhile, Sam is indoctrinated into a military squad of young people led by Ben Parish (Nick Robinson).This starts interestingly enough. Once the movie splits in two, it becomes boring and unengaging. Chloë Grace Moretz is the star. The audience automatically follows her. The child soldier side is less convincing and less compelling. I'm glad the kids figure out the obvious lie. The time could be better spent trying to sell the chemistry between Evan and Cassie. The movie and the continuing franchise depend on it. The child soldier idea only works in the abstract. Once it's done in detail, questions start arising. As a young adult movie, they could never get dark enough for it to be convincing. Any sequels are unlikely but they set up the Scooby gang by the end. The apocalyptic YA trend continues.",The 5th Wave
3,claudio_carvalho,Silly Teen Adventure,5,15 November 2016,"When Earth is attacked by aliens, there is a sequence of waves of destruction to annihilate the population. The aliens drain the energy and create diseases and natural disasters. The teenager Cassie Sullivan (Chloë Grace Moretz) moves with her family to the countryside, but when her mother Lisa (Maggie Siff) dies, her father Oliver (Ron Livingston) decides to go to a refugee camp with Cassie and her young brother Sam (Zackary Arthur). Out of the blue, the army comes to the camp to transfer the survivors to a military base. They transfer the children first but Cassie misses the bus where Sam is. She learns that the in the 5th wave, the aliens have assumed the human form and she witnesses the military executing the civilians in the camp including her father. She flees and now she begins her quest to find Sam. Meanwhile the teenagers and children are trained by the military to fight the enemy. But how to know who is human and who is alien?""The 5th Wave"" is a teen adventure with a silly and illogical story and a shallow romance. The plot has an interesting beginning but unfortunately becomes terrible. The idea of using the teens and children to destroy the survivor is totally absurd. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""A 5ª Onda"" (""The 5th Wave"")",The 5th Wave
4,nogodnomasters,HOPE LET'S US SURVIVE,7,13 May 2018,"This is an alien attack film combined with a kids save the world movie. It centers on Cassie and not Katniss (Chloë Grace Moretz) who keeps a journal for first person narration so we can get the heavy meaningful themes, recapped at the end of the feature in case you missed the point. 40 minutes into the film, we cover the first three waves of the attack and Cassie's high school crush. The fourth and fifth wave are a bit ambiguous and seem connected, but ""The 4B Wave"" wouldn't sell.Cassie spends most of the film looking for her brother (Zackary Arthur). If you have seen a film before you quickly realize the twist as we painfully wait an additional 40 minutes for it to manifest itself to the characters. During this time we suffer through long painful dialogue. The ending leads us open for a sequel as this appears to just be a long introduction of characters for a series that could go on ad infinitum. David Vincent knows they're here.The film is designed to appeal to teens and younger. There is no humor in the film as there was in ""Independence Day."" No colorful characters, except for maybe that one girl (Maika Monroe and not a hot Asian chick) and we didn't get enough of her to carry the film. There was nothing wrong with the performance of Chloë Grace Moretz, other than she had dry lines and couldn't do anything with them. They needed to cut 10-20 minutes out of the film.We find out Cassie was poorly named for Cassiopeia the beautiful, vain, and boastful queen. Where is JK Rowling when you need a meaningful name? Ben (Nick Robinson) is another story that would be funny, but they made sure it wasn't.Kids will love this film more than adults. There is minimal swearing, my understanding is they removed a lot from the book in that regard. No sex or nudity. While there is killing, the graphic scenes are more off screen than on. No religious content during the end of the world. More like a PG-11 than 13.",The 5th Wave
5,kosmasp,Young Adult novel,5,29 May 2016,"The Young Adult movie and book craze goes on. And while I haven't read the source material, the intentions and the core group for this are obvious. Mostly girls and in their teenage years. So watching this as a male, I do realize I'm not the one this aims to please. You don't always have to have a broad appeal to a movie. It can be a movie that just wants to please a special group of people and still be good.There is not really much I could spoil about the plot of the movie, because it is very obvious, the way it is played and the way it plays out. Some talk about sexist scenes like the one were Chloes character is watching a boy bathing half naked (or fully naked? We only see his upper body). But that is besides the point and actually a character moment. A moment were the girl realizes she is a woman too. But I guess if you are overly sensitive you'll see it differently.Overall it's decent and should be pleasing for those who care",The 5th Wave
6,jboothmillard,The 5th Wave,3,17 August 2018,"I saw the trailer for this movie in the cinema, I am a fan of the leading young actress, so that a big draw for me, and it looked like something good, I read later the negative reviews it received, but I was still willing to give it a chance, directed by J Blakeson (The Disappearance of Alice Creed). Basically a city-sized alien spaceship suddenly appeared above Earth, the extra-terrestrials are referred to as ""The Others"", and teenager Cassie Sullivan (Chloë Grace Moretz) recounts the events following the invasion. The alien invaders unleashed made four attacks, referred to as Waves of destruction. In the 1st Wave, an electromagnetic pulse permanently destroyed all electrical power, including transportation and water. In the 2nd Wave, the planet's geology and fault lines were manipulated by the Others, causing earthquakes and mega-tsunamis that destroyed coastal cities and islands. In the 3rd Wave, a strain of avian flu virus was spread, with birds carrying the infection across the planet, one of the casualties was Cassie's mother Lisa (Maggie Siff). Cassie, her father Oliver Sullivan (Office Space's Ron Livingston) and brother Sam (Zackary Arthur) find a refugee camp in the woods with roughly 300 survivors. A few days later, an army unit with working vehicles arrive, Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber) claims that the 5th and final Wave is imminent, the Others have begun to use humans as physical hosts, this is the 4th Wave. The children are being taken to safety at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, they say the buses will return to retrieve the adults, Cassie is separated from Sam, and witnesses the army massacring the adults, including her father. Cassie scavenges her way toward the base, but she is shot in the leg by an unseen shooter and passes out. About a week later she wakes up in the farmhouse of Evan Walker (Alex Roe), who saved her, they leave together and head for the base. Cassie is shocked to learn that Evan is an Other, the aliens have invaded Earth years before, he was sent as a sleeper agent and merged his consciousness into a human host. Evan admits his humanity was reactivated when he saw Cassie, he disagrees with the invasion and lets her leave, he warns that Colonel Vosch and the military are possessed by the Others. At the base, the military have used deception and technology to convince the rescued children that humans outside have been possessed, they provide them with military training, forming them into squads to go on kill missions. Sam is in a squad led by Zombie aka Ben Parish (Nick Robinson), Cassie's former high school crush, along with tough teenage girl Ringer (Maika Monroe), Dumbo (Tony Revolori) and Teacup (Talitha Eliana Bateman). While on a kill mission, Ringer removes her military tracking implant, she is registered as an Other-possessed human on the squad's scopes, the squad realise that the plan is to kill real unpossessed humans, making them the 5th Wave. Ben devises a plan, he has one of his squad shoot him and returns to base, claiming the rest of the squad were killed, then he will try and retrieve Sam, who was left behind. Ben confronts Colonel Vosch about child warriors being the 5th Wave and Cassie kills Sergeant Reznik (Coyote Ugly's Maria Bello) during her implant operation. Cassie find each other and leave to find Sam, Evan sets off many bombs and warns them to hurry before the entire facility is destroyed. Colonel Vosch and the surviving military evacuate with the human children by military aircraft, while Ringers helps Cassie, Ben and Sam to escape, just as Evan completes the destruction of the base. Ben's squad is reunited, and Cassie ponders the strength of hope as humanity's driving force for survival. Also starring Gabriela Lopez as Lizbeth, Bailey Anne Borders as Julia, Parker Wierling as Jeremy and Nadji Jeter as Poundcake. Moretz is a good choice as the teenager living in the world facing alien invasion, the four attacks of power outage, earthquakes and floods, a bird-flu pandemic and human body snatching set things up reasonably well, but the imminent fifth attack gets clichéd, I sort of went along with it, but not all of the special effects are great, it is muddled, and the ending (that may lead to an unlikely sequel) is silly, it is not boring or terrible, it is just an overly average science-fiction drama. Adequate!",The 5th Wave
7,paul_haakonsen,Invasion and annihilation. And sullen teenagers!...,5,8 June 2018,"I must admit that I had expected something more from this movie. But it just turned out to be a teenage movie with a layer of action and Sci-Fi elements to spice it up.As for the storyline in ""The 5th Wave"", well it was rather mundane and generic, although the twist as to whom The Others were was a nice one, and I had not really foreseen that one.The acting in the movie was adequate, but Chloe Moetz constantly walks around looking like a sullen and semi-depressed girl, so it was hard to take her serious in this movie.The special effects were quite good, as was the CGI. And let's be honest, this is very much a CGI carried movie, because the storyline, plot, characters and acting could only take the movie so far. So, of course, the CGI effects had to lift up the movie.This was hardly an outstanding or particularly memorable movie. And I doubt that I will return to watch this movie a second time.",The 5th Wave

10,oscaralbert,Opening Japan's monthly Sony Corp. sneak attack upon America . . .,5,25 January 2016,". . . a teenage blonde pawn in Japan's stealthy revenge war takes a page out of the ISIL, ISIS, and Al Qaeda Playbook with her summary execution-by-assault-rifle of an injured Christian simply because he is praying while clutching a Crucifix. You may recall that it was less than a month ago when Sony's CONCUSSION inflicted possibly fatal harm against BOTH our American National Religion (NFL football) AND another 80-plus-year-old American Institution, The Oscar Awards, thanks to the Will Smith Family behaving like traitorous ""sleeper agents"" of the Japanese Government. Today, with THE FIFTH WAVE, Japan is trying to convince kids that maybe they should or will have to grab assault rifles and slaughter any adults they can find, starting with their parents. If any American adults are able to sit through this derivative, predictable, and boring two-hour attack upon American Core Values, Sony argues that the American Public School System is so bad that most any student can be turned into a crazed serial killer with a few days' brainwashing. It seems that Japan's film office has ordered Sony to destroy America from within, with the help of dupes such as the Smith Family and Chloe Grace Moretz. They like to show impressionable U.S. children wanton attacks against Football, Christianity, The Oscars, and all of the rest of our grandparents' hand-me-downs.",The 5th Wave
11,neil-476,Fairly routine stuff,7,29 January 2016,"Cassie enjoys a happy life as a typical high schooler until, wouldn't you just know it, an alien invasion comes along. After a week or two of sitting ominously over the planet scoping stuff out, the aliens (""Others"") start with a 1st wave - an electromagnetic pulse taking out all power, followed by earthquakes which wreck stuff and cause floods (I got the impression that Lake Erie emptied itself across Ohio), then bird super-flu, followed by snipers. The 5th wave is awaited, albeit not especially eagerly.Chloe Moretz plays Cassie, and it's a role she can play with her eyes closed. I won't say that's what she does – that would be unfair: she is called upon to emote, and there are some physical demands – but she has made stronger impressions in the past and she will no doubt make stronger impressions in the future. This is a bit of a weird one. It's a post-apocalypse tale, one of my favourite science fiction sub-genres, and it's quite promising in its early stages, but then the army comes along and it suddenly switches into something rather more gung-ho than was promised at the start. Also, it doesn't seem to know quite what level to pitch itself at: there is a strong feel of Young Adult franchise a la Hunger Games, Maze Runner, Divergent (especially as there is all sorts of unresolved stuff at the end, demanding a follow-up), which means that it doesn't satisfy as an adult take on the material, but it's quite strong in terms of blood, protagonists killing innocents, and language. I'm not sure it succeeds at the level it's pitched at, because I'm not sure that level actually exists.Don't expect questions to be answered, either – vehicles work for some, not for others, for a start off. And I certainly needed rather more convincing about Evan than was provided.I quite enjoyed it, even though it didn't work properly.",The 5th Wave
12,phd_travel,Chloe Grace Moretz is the best again!,9,14 January 2016,"Of all the actresses to do YAF movies, Chloe Grace Moretz is the sweetest and most convincing of the bunch. She has the rare gift of being able to do both action and romance. She makes the character surprisingly affecting quite quickly in the movie. Her grief and anxiety are believable as she searches for her little brother and somehow manages to keep his teddy bear intact throughout. She has chemistry with her co stars Nick Robinson of Jurassic World and Alex Roe. Liev Schreiber actually is well cast for a change - his face suits his role.The story starts off impressively. The disaster scenes and waves of destruction are effective, exciting and grandly done. The middle section is a little slower when the training (a bit like Divergent) starts and the romance blossoms. The fighting and shooting are big budget action movie standard and well done considering it's kids who are doing the fighting.As the plot twists the story makes sense in it's own way and is clear enough to follow. I found it more palatable than the Hunger Games which has a rather sickening premise kids killing each other, and easier to relate to than the Divergent series which is rather monotonously dominated by fighting and training.Go see it - it's entertaining and enjoyable. Hope it does well enough to ensure the sequels are made",The 5th Wave

Most of the time they are not the best movies ever made but I just like the idea of the apocalypse etc. So I am not very critical when it's about reviewing blockbusters like those movies. But with this one I have to because honestly it is really bad. I am so glad I didn't pay to watch this abomination. I was going to but then I changed my mind and now I'm happy for that. The 5th Wave could have been good with better actors, with a better storyline and with lesser cheesy moments. The targeted audience for this movie are tweeners, they probably will like this kind of crap. But as an adult, even with an open mind, you sincerely can not find this a good movie. The story is so weak I couldn't wait it to be over. The world is taken over by aliens and the solution they came up with is that people like Maika Monroe and Chloë Grace Moretz (that are super annoying by the way) are going to save us, plus a bunch of kids. Really? Add on that the stupid love scenes in the middle of the battle for the end of mankind and you know what I'm talking about. The budget was 38 millions of dollars. 38 millions!

We are the 5th wave.At first I thought that with a cast like that, they couldn't get it wrong: Chloë Grace Moretz, Ron Livingston, Liev Schreiber, Maria Bello. I mean they are not the best actors that ever lived, but even if you leave them unattended on a set they would be decent, right? The problem was that they were not left of their own devices, instead having to play-act on a shitty script. The plot was rushed, the characters mere caricatures, the twist obvious from miles away and... that's basically it. The entire film stands on the twist premise. Once you eliminate that, you get a by the numbers young adult piece of crap.I also hoped that it is not part of a bloody trilogy, that it is a stand alone original content. Tough luck: it is part of a trilogy. It's Twilight for aliens (but not The Host).Bottom line: the acting was actually good, making the poor quality of the script hurt even more. When TV series are becoming better written than the books they are based on, cinema seems to go the other way and take the minimum possible from the original material and dumb it down to the lowest common denominator.",The 5th Wave
16,StevePulaski,"""The 5th Wave"" should rise from the ashes of concluded young adult franchises to be the next big contender in a saturated genre",9,22 January 2016,"With ""The Hunger Games"" franchise recently concluding, the ""Harry Potter"" franchise long out of the picture, and the ""Divergent"" series looking to wrap up in a couple months, Hollywood is undoubtedly scrambling to find the next big young adult franchise. Last time this kind of thing happened, we got such forgettable films like ""Vampire Academy"" and ""City of Ember,"" films that basically seemed to think they could scrape by on their name-recognition that they could, in turn, cover-up their own mediocrity. Now, however, the industry finds itself in more dire straights, so it only seemed right that Rick Yancey's novel ""The 5th Wave,"" the first of a trilogy, would find itself blown up on the big screen sooner or later.For the first time in recent memory, after practically sneering at every adaptation of ""The Hunger Games"" in some way and totally dismissing ""Divergent"" all around, I've found a young adult franchise I'm actually really intrigued in seeing adapted to film. ""The 5th Wave"" is a sprawling and immersive action experience, brimful of the kind of emotions that come with apocalyptic destruction that don't feel like it's pandering to mawkish sentiments. It's a wickedly entertaining film, opening with its feet practically sprinting and never letting up, even during its slower, more reserved sequences of buildup and character relations. It's first film of 2016 you really should see.The film revolves around Cassie Sullivan (Chloë Grace Moretz), a high school girl who is caught in the middle of utter chaos when a large, foreign spaceship suddenly appears in the sky and hovers over her community. The ship, housing aliens known as ""the others,"" unleash havoc on Earth in the form of ""waves."" The first wave disables anything that runs on power: cell-phones, cars, computers, telephones, motors, engines, generators, electricity, etc. The second wave completely destroys the levee and faultline system of the world, resulting in massive coastal flooding and the destruction of all islands in the blink of an eye. These two waves are designed to weed out the weak and feeble.The third wave launches a virus that appears like a mixture of Ebola/Swine flu, weakening the immune systems of those who have proved themselves strong enough to survive the first two waves. The more advanced and abstract fourth and fifth waves are what the film focuses on. Upon the first three waves occurring, Cassie, her brother Sammy (Zackary Arthur), and her father Oliver (Ron Livingston) seek refuge at a local internment camp in the woods. During their stay, the U.S. Army arrives, commanded by Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber), stating that all the children must be bussed to safety, while the adults need to be inspected because ""the others"" have found a way to come down to Earth in the form of humans.Cassie winds up getting separated from Sammy, and she must defend herself as she tries to define the fourth and fifth waves and figure out how to combat them. Meanwhile, the children, from toddler-aged kids to high-schoolers, are essentially drafted into the war with the others, under the command of Ben ""Zombie"" Parish (Nick Robinson), who happens to be Cassie's crush. Meanwhile, Cassie seeks comfort under Evan Walker's (Alex Roe) roof, a local boy who protects her after she's nearly assassinated by a sniper.""The 5th Wave"" has one of the most energetic and exciting opening sequences I've seen in quite sometime. The film shows the waves unfold to the narration of Moretz, and the chaos is depicted with incredible special effects and pulsating tension that almost makes the film seem like something out of a graphic novel. Few live-action films could capture the energy and excitement of what can happen on the colorful pages of a graphic novel (""The 5th Wave"" is not a graphic novel, to be clear), but this is a film that has that kind of energy and constant intensity found in one of those many volumes. This is also largely in part to the action being so clear and discernible, rather than muddled and incoherent, thanks to the skilled hands of director J Blakeson and cinematographer Enrique Chediak.Even when ""The 5th Wave"" is focusing on conversation between Cassie and Evan, it never becomes boring or poorly paced. The downtime in the middle of the film only makes the bookended scenes of peril and devastation all that more affecting. This is also one of the first young adult films to really be successful at communicating loss and guilt without going overboard in some aesthetic element to communicate said emotion. We can believe the events and how they affect the characters because, for one, screenwriters Susannah Grant, Akiva Goldsman, and Jeff Pinker don't dwell on ""woe is me"" sequences for our lead character and constantly emphasize her strength by her actions rather than her image, and two, Moretz is a talented enough performer in her young age to handle enough emotional weight quite effectively.I find it intriguing how so much emphasis was placed on ""The Hunger Games""'s Katniss Everdeen character, when she was about as opaque of a character as you can get when it comes to a female hero, and by the end of the second part of ""Mockingjay,"" nobody seemed to care that the entire end sequence was a contradiction of her being. Cassie Sullivan finds herself being much more of a riveting character, and Moretz finds herself in a position to showcase her talent rather than her image of female strength and power. ""The 5th Wave"" is a strong and truly enjoyable action film that could fittingly stand alongside the other big action releases of this year.",The 5th Wave
17,sddavis63,A Ho Hum Alien Invasion Story For Kids,2,10 July 2019,"Chloe Grace Moretz was all right in this. I start by saying that because I desperately want to say something positive. She was all right as Cassie - a high school student who gets caught up in an alien invasion and is separated from her little brother after her parents are killed. If the story had revolved around Cassie and her search for her brother through this threatening environment then the movie might have been passable. Not great, but passable - much like Moretz's performance. Not great, but definitely passable. But, truthfully, the bulk of the movie is just plain silly. It starts by fairly quickly recounting the first three ""waves"" of the alien invasion - aliens knock out all power on earth, then cause natural disasters, then unleash a plague. The fourth wave (to avoid a spoiler I won't describe it) is then unleashed and an army of children gets recruited to defend earth and humanity from the coming fifth wave. That's about it - except for the unnecessary and unconvincing romantic subplot that Cassie gets involved in. That's the story.It's weak in almost every aspect that counts. Let's face it. Alien invasion movies are a dime a dozen. If one is going to go to the effort of making an alien invasion movie then there has to be some hook to catch the viewer with; something to make the movie stand out from the rest of the genre. But Moretz's passable performance aside, nothing and no one else stood out for me. There was precious little action until the last half hour or so and even then the action was unconvincing. Special effects are low quality. There's an attempt at a plot twist but the ""secret"" that gets revealed really didn't cause me any great surprise. Overall I thought the movie had a cartoonish, comic book-type quality to it that made its almost two hour runtime mind-numbing. It seems definitely targetted mostly toward the high school/teenage viewer, and is in fact based on a trilogy of young adult novels - meaning that there actually could be two more movies coming out, although after three years there mercifully doesn't seem to be any move in that direction. My own feeling is that anyone looking for a more sophisticated type of science fiction is likely going to be disappointed in this. (2/10)",The 5th Wave
18,Hellmant,Missed the mark.,5,19 February 2016,"'THE 5TH WAVE': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A teen sci-fi flick; based on the popular 2013 YA novel, of the same name, by Rick Yancey. It stars Chloe Grace Moretz; as the survivor of a lethal alien attack, on Earth (which destroyed most of the population), who's now desperately trying to save her younger brother. The film costars Nick Robinson, Alex Roe, Maika Monroe, Zackary Arthur, Ron Livingston, Liev Schreiber and Maria Bello. It was directed by J. Blakeson; and it was scripted by Susannah Grant, Akiva Goldsman and Jeff Pinkner. I thought it was an OK movie.The film tells the story of a 'not-too-distant future', when alien invaders have wiped out most of humanity; in four deadly attacks. One young woman, Cassie Sullivan (Moretz), has survived the attacks; but most of her family was killed, all except her younger brother Sam (Arthur). They've been separated, by military forces, and Cassie has now made it her obsessive mission to find Sam, and protect him. She must team up with other young survivors, in order to do so.The movie is mildly entertaining; the effects aren't bad, and it's a decent sci-fi premise. Moretz makes a good, strong young heroine; but her role isn't really that interesting. The rest of the cast are all good, in other movies, but they're kind of wasted here. I do like some young adult films (like 'THE HUNGER GAMES' and 'DIVERGENT' series), but this one missed the mark.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/0d1sap746-M",The 5th Wave
19,Buddy-51,Fails to stand out in an already over-crowded field,4,28 November 2016,"""The 5th Wave"" is the umpteenth version of a post-apocalyptic scenario that has all but taken over pop-culture since the turn-of-the-century (or, more specifically, the attacks on 9/11). In this case, it's a race of mysterious aliens who, in an effort to take over the planet, are eliminating humans one ""wave"" at a time (destroying the power grid, creating massive earthquakes and tsunamis, spreading fatal epidemics, etc.). The screenplay focuses primarily on one Ohio family, and, specifically, their teenage daughter, Cassie (Chloe Grace Moretz), who suddenly has to find ways of surviving in this new and dangerous world where everyone is out for him- or herself and, thus, no one can be trusted.As they pass through desolate, auto-strewn landscapes that look like they came straight out of ""The Walking Dead,"" Cassie and a caring (and dreamy) stranger (Alex Roe) - who saves her life at one point and rehabilitates her to full health - go in search of her missing little brother. And, speaking of TWD, since the movie can't fit any ACTUAL zombies into its narrative, it partially compensates by at least having a character NAMED ""Zombie"" (Nick Robinsons).Ah well, after a few moments of fleeting interest in the early stages, the movie quickly settles into a predictable and boring series of teen drama, alien invasion and end-of-the-world tropes.And with its open-ended conclusion, we're left wondering (or is it dreading?) if there will be a 6th wave in our movie-going future.",The 5th Wave
20,FeastMode,my notes,1,26 June 2019,"February and I'm pretty sure it will end up being my worst movie of 2016. absolutely everything in this movie is horrendous. the acting is abysmal. the dialogue is atrocious. the action is useless. the romance is childish and unbearable. the CGI is subpar. this is such a typical high school movie aimed at high school kids. another horrible movie based on a young adult novel. everything is so typical. the love triangle. omg the scene where she sees dude bathing in the lake and they zoom in on his abs. wow. so many cringe-worthy scenes and omg moments. oh and another thing, NOTHING MADE SENSE. I could make fun of this movie for hours. I want to make a Chris Stuckmann-style hilariocity review of this movie (1 viewing)

21,ThomasDrufke,An Atrocity,2,25 January 2016,"January truly is the dumping ground for cinema. I'm not even sure I can consider some of these films cinema, but I digress, The 5th Wave is yet another horrible entry in the long list of January releases to completely go off the rails in terms of quality.The film stars the up and coming actress Chloe Grace Moretz as Cassie Sullivan, a teen who spends the length of the run-time searching for her younger brother in the midst of an apocalyptic world run by ""the others"" who have chosen to kill off the human race in a series of 5 'waves'. To begin with, the trailers looked awful but I thought the film's premise had promise. I had heard that the book was well received as a refreshing young adult book that blurred the lines between adult and young adult fiction. In a saturated era of young adult films, we needed a film with that sort of premise to re-energize the genre.Sadly, The 5th Wave proves to be just another clichéd young adult filled with forced romances (and yes, there's also a love triangle). Romances are fine when they feel natural, but I can assure you, nothing about any of the events or sequences in The 5th Wave feel natural. Every moment feels like something that happened strictly to set up a character to be in a particular situation. It's unfortunate because the opening shots of seeing the first 3 waves take out half the population was interesting and included some half way decent CG, but the rest of the film is incredibly uninteresting. The one redeemable aspect of this film is the score by Henry Jackman. I really loved the music and overall sound design of the film, but besides that, it was complete trash. January please go away. +Great score-Why is there a forced romance-Nothing that happens feels natural-Horrible writing2.8/10",The 5th Wave
22,MLDinTN,terrible cgi and story line,2,26 August 2016,"This movie was not good, a real disappoint since I like Chloë Grace Moretz. First the cgi effects were awful. The giant wave of water, the way kids could tell someone was alien. Just stupid.The central story is about Cassie, trying to find her younger brother whom has been taken away by the army. And we learn there is more to the army than meets the eye. Liev Schreiber plays a laughable head of the army type guy. The lines he was given, just awful.And everyone knows an army of kids is the best change aliens would have, right? And the way a half and half turns on his own kind, because he likes a human, silly.FINAL VERDICT: Don't waste your time.",The 5th Wave
23,Cineanalyst,"Same Rubbish, Different Title",2,28 May 2020,"It finally picks up a bit at the finale, when all of the predictable plot twists have played out (besides the obligatory set-up for a sequel), after we've come to accept the lousy CGI and bad acting, if not the grating score, and when the dialogue is kept to a relative minimum for some race-against-time action. The climax at the military base was about the one time I wasn't either laughing at how bad ""The 5th Wave"" is or fighting the urge to turn away in disgust at its even worse moments. I fail to appreciate how anyone enjoys this young adult fiction tripe. The writing is atrocious. Formulaic and telegraphed plot twists. Part of the narrative always involves children being trained for some sort of militaristic sport. Always a love triangle or two. Usually one of the boys is conflicted about which side to join--but, of course, always picks the one the girl is on. There's no nuance or subtlety to the conflict, or the acting, either. Never is. Here, it's an alien invasion. Indeed, there's no nuance or subtlety to anything in these movies. Teenage characters either wear their emotions on their sleeves or they shout them. Dialogue is obnoxious. ""Love isn't a trick."" Besides the finale, my favorite scene was when they took the kid brother away on a bus. Most of his lines consist of him repeatedly yelling his sister's name. It was pissing me off, and I was glad to be rid of him for a while.Have you seen ""The Hunger Games"" movies, the ""Divergent"" series, ""The Maze Runner"" ones, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" (2019)? Same rubbish. Sure, it's executed worse this time around, but it's always the same. I recommend the 1956 and 1978 ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" if you want to see films where aliens assume human shape, as well as writing that knows how to tease out the promise of such a concept.P.S. I don't know what's up with the poster for ""Big Fish"" (2003) in the movie. I remember nothing about that Tim Burton feature, although I know I saw it, because I wrote a review on it. Perhaps, ""The 5th Wave"" is right--there is hope. Someday, I will forget this travesty, too.",The 5th Wave

Cassie (Moretz) is an ordinary high schooler. Her and her family are living life peacefully until one day, out of nowhere, an alien spacecraft shows up above her house. Little by little they begin to attack the planet systematically destroying what they want. When the unthinkable happens Cassie and her brother are separated. She is now on a mission to get back to him, and when she meets Evan (Roe) he offers help, but she was told not to trust anyone. This is yet another young-adult-teen-save-the-world type movie along the lines of The Hunger Games and Divergent. It may have been the fact that I don't think we need anymore movies like that but I wasn't really looking forward to this. Unlike the other series like this this one grabbed me right away. It did slow down in some parts but really I thought this was exciting and was very much into this. I didn't know much about the book series and actually wasn't even sure if this was a single book or not. That aside I really enjoyed this and for the first time in a series like this I actually am looking forward to seeing the rest of the movies. Overall, exciting and tense.

25,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,8 April 2016,"The 5th WaveThe easiest way for invading aliens to assimilate into our society is by staging a televised singing competition.Unfortunately, the enslaved adolescents in this sci-fi movie have no vocal range.When aggressors from outer space unleash an array of orchestrated attacks on the Earth, including EMPs, earthquakes, plagues and the possession of human hosts, military-trained teenagers (Chloë Grace Moretz, Nick Robinson, Maika Monroe) are tasked by their superiors (Liev Schreiber, Maria Bello) with exterminating the infected adult population, and averting the 5th and final assault.But when members of the junior militia start exhibiting inhuman abilities, the real purpose behind their formation is revealed.With its derivative body-snatching script, pedestrian creature design and obvious twist ending, this monotonous adaptation of the YA novel is a much lower-caliber film than its post- apocalyptic counterparts.

26,westsideschl,The Worst of the Worst,1,11 May 2016,"Bad on every variable/level/potential area for any type of criticism. Acting: Mostly TV series resumé supporting actors who were in the film for cheapness or candy eye appeal and to rip off the under 18 demographic. What's going on with Chloë Grace Moretz? Was ""Kick Ass"" the pinnacle of her career because nothing since is worth remembering? Does she need the money? I'll give her some if she'll put the hard work in and be more discerning. Oh well! Storyline: What part of the miss-mash of this film has not been ripped off from countless other ""apocalyptic"", alien infestation, youth to the rescue past productions? It's the current, cheap, faddish TV vibe. Then there's the ""let's-sit-around-the-campfire"" ending left stupidly vague enough to suggest a sequel. Creative? The buildup to Chloë to save love interest subplot was more laughable than believable. Dialogue: Apart from the robotic recitation it was below sophomoric level intelligence - definitely middle school level standard. ""Others"", that's what we now call aliens. Haha. That must have really challenged the writer's extensive lexicon.Graphics can always save a sci-fi flick: Not this time. The worst floating (How? Who knows and cares.) alien craft yet seen. Looked like made by a grade schooler with Lego's when left unattended. The physics of the thing would not get past a middle schooler without them laughing. The stolen idea of an alien clinging thingy was bad, but the graphics were '70s level cheap. Again more laughable than scary. Props: I get into hysterics every time I see an apocalyptic film with cars on a roadway strewn in a variety of directions, usually with a few bodies or burning tires placed appropriately. If a viewer takes the time and looks at the pattern/spacing/directions and other attributes it doesn't make any sense. Even the panic evacuation of Fort McMurray recently, the cars were still orderly. Directing & Editing: There must not have been a director on this film since it was totally (seriously) directionless. In consort was the editor who spliced & diced like a sushi chef who has never handled a knife before.",The 5th Wave

28,The-Sarkologist,It's the End of the World - Again,3,23 January 2016,"If you are looking for an alien invasion movie that is like, well, a cross with Twilight then this is going to be a movie for you. Okay, that may sound a little odd but seriously, halfway through the movie when our heroine (Cassie Sullivan) meets up with Evan Walker (and sorry about the spoiler but I have to mention it), whom we discover is one of the others (gee, really intelligent name for a race of aliens – obviously they were trying to create some mystery around them), he initially wants to kill her, that is until he fell in love with her. Seriously, that was so Twilight, well, not really because Twilight is mostly the vampire telling his beloved how it won't work out, while in this film his entire view of life was completely changed simply because he looked at her through the scope of a rifle. Seriously, that isn't how love works, at least in the real world, especially when we are talking about two races coming into contact with each other.I guess this film (and the book it is based upon) is trying to help us see what it was like from the viewpoint of the conquered as opposed to the conquerors. Mind you it isn't that subtle, especially when one of the characters attempts to undermine the alien's argument about invading a planet and killing off the inhabitants because, well, they need it, by claiming that humans have never done such a thing. Fortunately the alien points out that humans have been doing that for centuries, and as it turns out the shoe is now truly on the other foot. Mind you, if we are going to mimic reality in this scenario then the humans can't win because, well, the inhabitants of the continents that we colonised didn't win (well the Indians, and the Chinese did, but then again they had a superior technology to that of the Native Americans and Australian Aboriginies – and weren't wiped out by disease).So, where does it leave this film? Well I can't say that it was really all that entertaining. Sure we have a huge alien craft flying over the world which looked suspiciously like the craft out of District 9. We have cities being obliterated by tidal waves, but then it basically degenerates into a film where a bunch of kids have been recruited into the army so that they can fight back against the aliens, and Cassie wandering around the woods trying to rescue her brother. Sure, there was a twist, but I pretty much worked it out right from the beginning, especially since a random character says something that pretty much blows everything out of the water.It sort of ends pretty abruptly as well, but I have since discovered that it is based on another one of those young adult sci-fi books, though considering where Divergent and Maze Runner is heading I don't see any potential whatsoever in the continuation of this film beyond what I have seen so far.

29,Reno-Rangan,"Another teen film trilogy, alien invasion theme on a roll.",5,24 April 2016,"The 80s teen films were different, (like the recent one 'Turbo Kid') especially those I watched when I was growing up in the late 90s and early 2000s. But now most of them are dystopian action-adventure-fantasy/sci-fi themes, and obviously trilogies with high end graphics. I won't blame for that, the time has come for a change, the movies have technical qualities and they know how to render them, but the stories are terrible.To me this was just an okay film. Felt like the action-adventure versions of 'The Host', but I loved that one, not this. I know it's a trilogy, so, more stories to come with more explanations, but the first film in a series is always important and it failed to impress me. This installment is all about a teen girl and her younger brother. After getting separated during the chaos of alien invasion, she goes to look for him and that's the film.This might be the finer contents for a book, but for a movie, it is not that any special. I did not like the ending as well, felt like it was so stupid. Even some B films got better conclusion and stunt sequences. I feel bad for Chloe Moretz for taking up this project. She should do more action films like 'Kick-Ass'. I thought she would be the one who's going to replace Angelina Jolie. I can only hope for this series to get better in the follow up and end as a decent trilogy.5/10",The 5th Wave
30,leonblackwood,"Decent concept, bad execution! 3/10",3,28 May 2016,"Review: I actually found the concept of this movie half decent, and the director covered a lot questionable aspects of the plot but boy, was it boring. Now that they have put the Hunger Games to bed, they kick off another franchise about a girl being a ""one woman army"" fighting for the nation, trying to save mankind but Chloe Grace Moretz, who plays the leading role as Cassie, was definitely not a convincing warrior. The movie kicks off, showing Chloe living a normal life with her loving parents and her little brother but when a strange looking spaceship turns up, out of nowhere and takes out there electricity and starts to attack the humans, everyone starts to question who to trust. As the Aliens can take human form, everybody doesn't know who is human or not, so the army come up with a special helmet which can tear them apart. The only problem is that the helmet doesn't work on adults, so the army split the adults from the kids, and run there tests and prepare them to take out the Aliens. Whilst getting on the bus, with her younger brother to the armies colony, Cassie has to turn back to get her brothers teddy bear, which makes her late for the bus and leaves her stranded in the woods. She then witnesses life changing events which change her life, and her home town for ever, so she has to quickly learn how survive by herself. After a while she teams up with another teenager who is also stranded, and they battle to get to the colony were Cassie's little brother is. They soon work out who they can trust and they fight against the human formed Aliens to save mankind. For a 2 hour movie about Aliens destroying humans, the action was pretty poor and Cassie started to get on my nerves. A lot of the action is filmed in the dark, so you can't really see what is going on or who is who. On top of that, the script was poor and there is way too much footage of them running around in the woods. They obviously left the ending open for a sequel because there was no conclusion to the whole Aliens vs. Humans fiasco but it's not a movie that I will be rushing to see when it's released. Disappointing!Round-Up: A few of Chloe Grace Moretz, 19, movies have been disappointing because she has been the wrong actress for the role, like the awful Carrie remake, Dark Shadows, Hick and Hugo but she was absolutely brilliant in the first Kick Ass movie, which pushed her to stardom. The second Kick Ass was disappointing but loads of new projects started to come her way after her performance in the first movie. Personally, I don't think she was the right choice for this movie, because of the drastic change from a family girl to a Warrior on the run, just didn't suit her. After listening to all of the hype surrounding this movie, I must admit, I am really disappointed with the outcome and it seemed like a lot of fuss about nothing. The movie was directed by J Blakeson who also brought you The Disappearance of Alice Creed, starring Gemma Arterton. His lack of experience behind the camera is noticed in this film and some of the disastrous moments looked like he was using toys. I just hope he does better with the sequel, if he wants to kick off a successful franchise. Budget: $38million Worldwide Gross: $110millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies starring Chloe Grace Moretz, Matthew Zuk, Gabriela Lopez, Liev Schreiber, Nick Robinson, Maggie Siff, Maria Bello and Ron Livingston. 3/10",The 5th Wave

Along the way Moretz's character gets into a little love triangle with two hot guys.Sounds familiar? Well, I was kinda hoping with Hit Girl heading up the cast I would get some...""Kick Ass"" action in this film, but man was this the weakest action adventure Young Adult movie I've seen. The level of action is no where near the level of Maze Runner or Divergent. It needed that boost too. Someone put this movie together so sloppy that it stops making since far too early. You don't even have to be paying attention to notice the plot is going down some pretty big holes. So disappointing.

32,Stevieboy666,Pretty silly plot but reasonably enjoyable,6,19 June 2018,"Gigantic alien crafts appear in Earth's skies, a bit like in Independence Day and the planet and human race becomes subjected to ever increasing waves of destruction until it is time for the 5th...
This film starts off with the heroine, a teenage girl called Cassie, narrating the story, so it's clearly one of those movies aimed at a younger audience. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact there is a fair amount of horror and violence to be found. The issue of loss and separation of loved ones is dealt with when first Cassie's mother dies from the infection wave. Then her Dad is killed in cold blood, and at the same time she and her younger brother get separated. All quite sad. The military, the ""saviours,"" turn out to be, predictably, ""others"", the name given to the alien invaders, who can adopt human guise. When they massacre all of the adults at a refuge camp that was chillingly real in as far as genocide is sadly one of humanities greatest crimes.
However where it gets silly is having the army (actually ""others"") train kids and turn them into military units in order to be tricked into killing off human survivors! Can't the aliens just do that themselves?
There's a love interest, teen girl meets buff boy, etc, as to be expected.. Acting and effects are all reasonably good. While this film is certainly no SF classic I found it to be reasonably enjoyable hour and a half.",The 5th Wave

This movie is based on a series of teen books that are written by Rick Yancey-Yes, it's a trilogy, so if it is successful, look for at least 2 more movies. Chloe is the teen heroine of the movie. An alien invasion strikes the planet, and her parents die in the ensuing chaos. Chloe then gets separated from her little brother. The aliens strike in multiple waves of attack. The first is an EMP-electromagnetic pulse-that wipes out all electronics, including cars, planes and cell phone service. The second is unnatural disasters, including earthquakes and tsunamis that flood all the major cities. The third is in the form of disease, mostly by bird flu, that dwindles down the population even more. The fourth is actual alien boots on the ground invasion, coming to finish us off. The fifth is....well, I better not give everything away. Nick is a fellow high school student/alien fighter that Chloe has a crush on, Alex is a stranger Chloe meets when she is on the run from the aliens and looking for her brother and Liev is a soldier that leads his troops in to help any remaining survivors. Liev then begins the training of the surviving children into becoming soldiers to fight the aliens. The aliens inhabit human bodies, so it is hard to tell them apart from normal humans until the military comes up with a gimmick that lets them be seen. I have not read the books but I guess you can distill the essence down into, 'It's teens versus aliens!' There are a couple of cameos by Maria Bello and Ron Livingston. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language and some teen partying-before the invasion-and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",The 5th Wave

36,kirbylee70-599-526179,Teen Saviors...Again!,7,9 May 2016,"One thing can be said about Hollywood. When they discover a money making concept they'll milk it as dry as a bone. This doesn't mean those movies made about a topic are bad but after a while they all sort of get mixed in together and it becomes hard to differentiate one from another, especially when they're being released fast and furious (no, not that franchise here). Lately it seems that the only reason for adults in films is to give birth and then stand back and idly watch while teens do things like save the world. That premise is a big part of THE 5TH WAVE.Cassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz) is your typical teen girl (as far as movie makers are concerned). She goes to school, pines over the good looking boy Ben (Nick Robinson) and loves her parents. Her life gets turned upside down within short order here as the Earth is invaded by aliens in attacks termed waves. The first wave is an EMP that knocks out all electrical systems, the second a combination of earthquake/tsunami that wipes out the coasts, the third is a form of disease spread by birds and the fourth are termed ""silencers"", invaders who look human.As Cassie and her family deal with each successive wave until most of the world is ended, they make a last ditch effort with others to band together in a camp. When the army shows up commanded by Col. Vosch (Liev Schreiber) everyone is overjoyed. With buses only big enough to handle so many at a time they're filled with the youngest members of the camp first to take them to Wright Patterson Air Force Base. Cassie is on board with her brother Sam who forgets his teddy bear. As she runs to get it, the buses leave her behind.The joy is short lived as the adults in the group argue about letting their children go unaccompanied, a fight breaks out and in an attempt to regain order the troops open up on the parents. Cassie hides during this but returns to find her father now dead joining her mother who died in the disease wave. Determined to find her brother, she packs up the essentials and heads out on foot to be rejoined with him. Along the way she'll face the dangers of alien drones that watch from the sky as well as ""silencers"" all around.As all of this goes on the Army takes the young people left on the world and begins training them to be the next armed forces to protect the planet. Visors are developed to allow the wearer to see the aliens beneath the surface of the humans infested by them. Ben has made it to the base as well and Sam is a part of his group. While Cassie tries to find her way to them the youth groups train, preparing for a special mission. In the end a few twists and turns (that some will see early on) occur and people the characters may have trusted once are not what they seem. In the end will the Earth by saved or not? The movie offers a decent science fiction tale here, another in a long line of alien invasion films that dates back to 1953's ""WAR OF THE WORLDS"". This time around the concept of teen heroes has been added, a genre that has been around but seems to have found more traction lately as well as become a huge franchise generating machine for Hollywood with the success of both ""THE HUNGER GAMES"" and ""DIVERGENT"". The odds are that the same was intended for this movie but the box office figures haven't done as well as expected so odds are this one ends here. I won't say that's a good or bad thing when it comes to the actual movies themselves but the non-stop offerings of teen's saving everything, being smarter than adults or taking over every screen on multiplexes across the country has made for some truly lackluster movies.Box office sales are up but only because the price of the tickets has risen as well. As corporations control the movies we see the more pre-packaged product and less real movies we get at the theater. Certainly there is a way to balance that but as long as the number crunchers are in control the odds aren't favorable in that happening. Once those numbers begin to drop perhaps but that may take a while.So for the time being let's enjoy movies like this even if they have become predictable. The acting in this one is better than most and the production values are quite well done. While there are no standout performances and every teen looks fresh from the pages of a fashion magazine, all in all each does a solid job here. The effects are well done, a definite requirement for a movie like this, but at the same time don't offer a lot that's new.While typing this I realized my final view on this film. It's not bad for a night's entertainment but it won't be one that you remember a year from now, a movie that will be talked about in 30 years or that will increase the star power of anyone involved. It's a vanilla movie, one that taste good but offers no substantial flavor. You can do worse with a movie to watch at home than this, but don't expect it to change the world either.",The 5th Wave
37,kluseba,The worst of its kind,4,29 March 2016,"''The 5th Wave'' is one of the worst in a series of dystopian coming-of-age dramas with female lead actresses where quantity beats quality. This movie stands out negatively because of a plot that lacks depth and explanations. There is an increasing number of scenes towards the end of the film that are so unrealistic that they feel like a misguided genre parody. An overall extremely exchangeable acting performance makes things even worse. The movie lacks tension and has noticeable lengths. It tries to be atmospheric at times but overall lacks consistent intensity as some parts of the film are dominated by vapid side plots focusing on generic dialogues. The visual special effects are also surprisingly unspectacular for such an ambitious production. Since this movie has another ridiculous open ending, I would urge you not to watch this film because you might feel obliged to watch future sequels that might be even worse.Despite all its flaws, this movie has a few positive elements to be fair. First of all, Chloë Grace Moretz is one of the more talented teenage actresses of this generation and she is the only reason why one should even consider watching this film. Her acting performance finds the right mixture between emotionality and maturity to convince related to the story and her age. Even the usual predictable love story between the two lead characters was more credible than I had expected. Another positive element are two twists in the last third of the story which were rather predictable for me but which might take younger audiences by surprise. The few atmospheric scenes that take place in the camp and in the forest were shot efficiently. The middle part of the movie was overall stronger than the lacklustre and overlong introduction and the laughable coda with its disappointing open ending. The middle section is also where the best fighting scenes and special effects take place that accelerate this surprisingly slow-paced movie a little bit.Still, this movie has more negative than positive elements and is obviously weaker than he comparable ''The Hunger Games'', the ''Divergent'' and ''The Maze Runner'' series. Only faithful fans of Chloë Grace Moretz should give this a try. This movie might be of a good average quality for teenagers who like the genre but is unappropriated for younger audiences and simply boring for older audiences.",The 5th Wave
38,TdSmth5,Decent teen flick,7,26 June 2016,"So here we have yet another film based on a series of teen survival books led by a girl. Just how many of these things are there? The 5th wave begins with some girl in a desolate and destroyed town who ends up killing a guy for no reason.Back in the past, the girl, Cassie, was a normal teen high schooler. Until the aliens spaceship from District 9 arrives and just hovers in the sky. One day they destroy all electricity with an EMP device. That's the first ""wave."" Then they cause massive tsunamis that has water flooding inland cities. The third wave is disease which ends up killing Cassie's mom.Cassie, her dad, and little brother leave town and find a refugee camp. Suddenly the army arrives, separates adult from children, buses the children first to a military base because they don't have enough buses for everyone. They gather all the adults in a room, who aren't particularly happy to be separated from their kids. A shootout ensues that ends up killing all the adult civilians and some army guys.The army guy in charge is Vosch who intends to create military units made up these kids to eliminate the aliens who by now have invaded earth--the 4th wave. As a military doctor explains, the aliens have taken on human form, but with special glasses shows the kids the aliens true from--some large bug attached to the base of the brain. She also implants all the kids with a tracking device.Cassie, now by herself, aims to reach the military base to ""rescue"" her brother. Now we are back to the first scene where she kills some guy. Back out on the street she's shot in the leg. Later she wakes up at some guy's house. He takes care of her but she wants to leave but he offers to follow her at a distance--and saves her life again when these human-looking aliens are patrolling the woods looking for the last humans.We focus on one kid military unit. They are outfitted with a helmet with a HUD that tags the aliens in green, and sent out to kill aliens. But the aliens are well-prepared. But now the kids make a startling discovery, which I won't reveal here. But we learn what the 5th wave is about and it changes everything.Cassie in the meantime also faces a revelation with the guy who rescued her. They eventually make it to the military base, reunite with the brother but still have to battle the aliens.The 5th Wave is an enjoyable movie even for adults. I really liked the plot twist. The movie is about 20 minutes too long and doesn't quite focus enough on the aliens, perhaps for obvious reasons. But the whole 'invasion because they need the planet' is almost becoming a lazy reason. Love is also a topic and it's well-handled. The image of children in uniform carrying guns and shooting around is striking. I wasn't crazy about the obligatory, offensive, pathetic, and condescending grrl power nonsense occasionally in the form of Cassie but even more so in the laughable character of Ringer, a tiny and skinny alpha hyper macho girl who of course treats males like crap. The ending of the movie isn't much of an end, even for a part of a series it should feel like something was accomplished, but it doesn't.",The 5th Wave
39,peterp-450-298716,Just another blablabla slobbery teen-girls movie ... Aaaaarrrgggg not again !,2,3 April 2016,"""There were no messages from our galactic party crashers during the first 10 days. But pretty soon, they had a name. We called them The Others.""I'm not a believer of those New Year's resolutions which are traditionally made during a drunk moment. Usually they are long forgotten after a few months. However, I have a new resolution after watching ""The 5th Wave"". I'm never ever going to watch another post-apocalyptic, teen film based on a youth book, where there's also the intention to use it in several, successive films. Content wise it's obvious this movie is intended for teenage girls. The initial genres linked to this movies are completely useless. It all started great and it seemed to me it was going into an interesting direction. But the moment the romantic, pubertal storyline started in the middle of the film, the labels of action-packed, adventurous SF for this twaddle, claptrap movie were replaced by lame and romance. Probably it'll grow a fan-base among pubescent teenage girls. Clearly there was a lot of borrowing from other films. The minute Cassie (Chloe Grace ""The Equalizer"" Moretz), Miss Popularity at school and in love with hunk number one of that school, saw the alien spaceship dangling above the earth (enjoy it because this is the only brief moment those aliens are shown), it was as if this scene came out of ""Independence day"". Quickly it becomes clear that these intergalactic visitors aren't as friendly as E.T. Through several attack, which are called ""waves"", these villains try to decimate the world population systematically. You don't need to be an intellectual to guess how many waves there will be, after looking at the film title. Lets find some more parallels with other films. The first wave reminded me of ""Dragon Day"". The second wave caused a tsunami that was filmed in a similar manner as in ""The Day after Tomorrow"". There just wasn't an oil tanker in it. And the training camp where teenagers learn how to fight against ""the others"", can safely be compared with ""Ender's Game"". The similarities with other dystopian teen films, with an innocent person emerging as the savior of mankind like ""The Hunger Games"", ""Divergent"" and ""The Giver"", are so obvious that it's unnecessary to rekindle them.As said earlier, it started quite reasonable and extremely shocking at the same time. The way Cassie's loved ones died, was even for me a lot to swallow. I'm sure Cassie's father Oliver (Ron ""The Conjuring"" Livingstone) imagined his fate less violent. And the third wave was fatal to Cassie's mother Lisa (Maggie Siff). It seemed as if the plagues that struck Egypt, were given a second life. Except that the fourth wave felt so infantile. A sort of laziness of the writer to make the twist used at the end of the movie a bit easier. It was so obvious to foresee what was going to happen when Cassie met the sturdy, wood chopping Evan Walker (Alex Roe). And from that moment on the film changed from a nail-biting, promising SF into an irritating, goody-goody teen movie that gave me cold shivers. Liev Schreiber still tried his best, but his role stands in sharp contrast to that in ""Spotlight"".All my respect for Moretz who tried to play a proper role but probably was inhibited by the ridiculous story. What particularly surprised me was that her cosmetic case, full of make-up and hair products, was nowhere to be seen throughout the film. I have to give the filmmakers credit for that. They had to pay attention to that meticulously, because I'm almost sure she carried that case all the time with her, judging by her appearance. I've encountered a review title somewhere, that sums it up perfectly: ""This SF-thriller doesn't want to tell a solid story to young adults – it just wants their money"". I hope there won't be any sequels, so youngsters can spend their money on more meaningful things.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",The 5th Wave
40,Seraphion,It's weird that this movie has so many good reviews,4,22 February 2016,"Pretty much everything is messed up in this movie. I can say I cast a neutral movie-only vote on this one since I haven't read the book. In fact, I didn't even know that this was abased on a book before I read the other reviews here. The way I see the reviews is that many, if not most, of the reviews here are already tainted with the experience from the book, something that made those reviews biased.As a movie, the story is really unbalanced. I really feel that the trailer cheated on those who watch this purely as a movie, not as a best-selling novel's adaptation. The drama is quick at pace but so much predictable all the way. All those grandiose momentum buildup with those fancy CGI heavy scenes only amounted to a predictable drama, that for me is not a good reason for a movie. Chloe Grace Moretz and Liev Schreiber's talents are relatively under utilized here as they don't really have any significant moment in the movie.",The 5th Wave
41,invisibleunicornninja,Pretty sure the budget listed on IMDb is fake.,2,12 March 2018,"The book may have been stupid - but at least it was well written. The reason why this story is unique is because it is so mindbogglingly stupid that no one would actually put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard to share it with other people. This movie could've been fun if it was self-aware. The problem is that it takes itself way too seriously. It takes a dumb idea and tried prestent it as genius. The Plot - I don't want to put in any spoilers, but this plot is stupid and convoluted. Its kinda fun in the book because its presented well, but in the movie, its even dumber. All I would have to do to get you saying ""wtf"" is describe the plot. Its really dumb. The Acting - All of the acting is terrible. While watching this, I both laughed and I cringed. The child actors have terrible direction and no talent. If I was a child in this movie, and looked back at my performance in this nonsense, I'd try to avoid every being recognized in it. Its so bad. I feel bad for a lot of the people who were involved in this money grab.Effects - The cinematography and the special effects are all terrible. This movie looks really cheap. The whole look of it is very bad. Action - The action is really bad. I could go on, but really it would be more of the same. Everything about this movie is really cheap and bad. Its not worth watching. I wish this movie was more self-aware about how dumb it is. Then we could've had a fun dumb action movie. Instead we got 2 hours of pretentious nonsense.",The 5th Wave
42,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The 5th Wave,7,5 February 2016,"Chloe Grace Moretz is all over the place these days. In fact, she's about to show up in four movies via the year 2016. Her latest release is The 5th Wave and it regretfully got shuffled into the month of January (never a good sign). Critics everywhere have been comparing it to Twilight and/or The Hunger Games flicks. Having never seen anything from those sets of franchises, I couldn't make a supposed juxtaposition. I as a critic, got a Maze Runner/Day After Tomorrow vibe more than anything else. And here I was expecting to have something to tide me over until Independence Day: Resurgence came out. Eh, no biggie.Anyway, with its themes of quarantined isolation and genocidal deception, The 5th Wave has a rather small budget even for a sci-fi, action thriller (a poultry $38 million). It shows. ""Wave"" is about countless alien invasions but doesn't give you enough visually, to think that any alien species really exist. I mean yeah they're disguised as humans but you can hardly tell. And despite a few spaceships roaming the sky and one giant mothership coming out of some cumulus clouds, this is more a military affair than an extraterrestrial glop fest. What can I tell ya, I dug it anyway. The storytelling is taut, the troupers are ones you generally care about, the action sequences are quite nifty, and the 80's-style soundtrack is seemingly legit. January ""junk?"" Thankfully no.Containing an intense, dystopian flavor (even for something rated PG- 13), featuring a romantic interest in the form of a half-human, taking place in Ohio, filmed entirely in Atlanta, GA, and based on a novel of the same name (written by Rick Yancey), The Fifth Wave throws buildup out the window as it contains two important flashbacks (one of them having varying camera angles) plus the adage of top billed actress Chloe Grace Moretz narrating Earth's cordial demise. The Moretz character is named Cassie Sullivan. She's your typical high school kid. She goes to parties, she meets boys, she has close friends, and she studies hard. This is all status quo until a plethora of alien attacks off her parents, separate her from her brother (Sam Sullivan played by Zackary Arthur), and force her to become a gun-wielding badass. You see these aliens are in the form of an army called the Others. And they are headed by a threatening colonel named Vosch (played by Liev Schreiber). From what I've gathered, Vosch's chief motivation is to eliminate all human adults and then have their children go through military training so that they get into gunfights while deceptively killing off each other. This plot point was one of many startling revelations in ""Wave"" that I didn't pick up initially.Being the best film of the year so far, the only thing that bugged me about The Fifth Wave though was its need to cut corners in terms of special effects shots. In my mind I kept saying, ""this isn't an art film, it's suppose to be a popcorn-munching blockbuster."" Oh well. What are ya gonna do.All in all, The 5th Wave ends with the disappearance of one of its supporting actors. And there are also a couple of final moments involving the protagonists hanging out at a campfire. These pointers are there to indicate that a sequel might be in the works. Based on ""Wave's"" lukewarm box office take and critical ribbing, I don't know if that will happen. If it does, I'll happily buy a ticket. What the heck. My rating: 3 stars.Of note: In The 5th Wave, director J Blakeson implores some cool, gun disarming scenes, he shoots a tidal wave sequence in which the cities of New York and London turn to rubble, and he casts an unrecognizable Mario Bello to play a Nazi-like sergeant (of the Others) named Reznik. Talk about a woman having a bad hair and makeup day. Yeesh!",The 5th Wave
43,rannynm,Realistic Crazy Effects,7,26 January 2016,"This live action feature film directed by J Blakeson is a truly epic movie with crazy special effects. I love this movie because it is a dystopian science fiction film with a twist of romance. Cassie Sullivan (Chloë Grace Moretz) is a typical 16-year-old girl who has life pretty easy. She loves her little brother Sammy (Zackary Arthur) more than anything in the world. One day she wakes up and her whole world has turned upside down. A series of aliens known as ""the Others"" has attacked planet earth and are trying to get rid of all of humanity in order to take the earth for themselves.The Others want to get rid of the human race with five waves. The first wave is a forever lasting power outage. The second wave is an enormous earthquake with a gigantic tsunami which wipes out many people. The third wave is a disease that spreads everywhere and very few people survive it and not many are immune. There are very few survivors. The fourth wave is when the Others disguise themselves to look just like humans and move among the humans. The people can trust no one because they have no idea who is human and their very existence is threatened. Cassie forms an alliance with a young man named Evan Walker (Alex Roe) who is determined to help her find her brother. Fighting for their lives, the fifth wave comes which is a fight between the survivors and the Others. The future of humanity is dependent on the humans outliving the Others. This movie has such cool special effects that look so realistic. My favorite scene is when the second wave comes with its massive earthquake and wave because it made me feel like I was there experiencing this, which would be absolutely terrifying! My favorite character is definitely Evan Walker! He is a very determined, hardworking, independent, brave and strong person. I love the way he plays this role because he is super believable and you can really tell that he cares about Cassie. The message of this film is to never give up hope. As Cassie says, ""It's our hope that makes us human.""I give The 5th Wave 4 out of 5 stars because it is pretty predictable, but overall this move is entertaining and enjoyable. I recommend this movie for ages 12-18 because it definitely has its scary moments. Reviewed by Lainey A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more youth reviews, go to kidsfirst dot org.",The 5th Wave
44,Rob_Taylor,Formula YA Post-Apoc movie with all that entails...,6,6 April 2016,"By the tag line I mean you get all the staples of this genre, warts and all.There is the usual post-apocalyptic world setting, this time courtesy of alien invaders. There is the usual ""Teens are the only ones that can make a difference!"" blather. Adults are either evil, or ineffectual.Additionally, and since this is aimed primarily at teen girls, there are the usual things from the Twilight plots. Namely, a girl that has a choice of two guys and so on.I'll be honest, this is kind of a Shyamalan movie. You know all the twists and plot developments long before the characters on screen. There is nothing - and I mean that - to surprise you or make you even raise an eyebrow. It's as by-the-numbers as it can get.Acting is passable, but I think they demanded a little too much emotion in some scenes than Chloe Grace Moretz was capable of giving. She did try, bless her, but she's not quite there yet.Also not there are the special effects. And in some cases, I'm sorry, but they really ought to be called Special Ed-fects. Clearly the budget wasn't there for blockbuster CGI. Instead, you get some truly amusing effects. Water, especially, was an eyesore in the effects department here. It was almost like the dawn of CGI all over again, when nobody could do water effects right.Then there was the ""Mars Attack"" effects. Basically, a set of goggles that allow the user to see the aliens for what they are. Except, the aliens heads glowed green and were surrounded by a big circle. In essence, every time they used the effect the result was something that looked a little like the aliens in bubble helmets from Mars Attacks. And, in a movie you are supposed to take seriously, that isn't a good thing.So, apart from the formula plot, atrocious CGI and Mars Attacks goggles, was it any good? Well, it was... harmless. I can't say I was bored but I'd be lying if I said it was edge of the seat stuff. With such a predictable plot that even Nostradamus could have got this one right, it was never going to be exciting or tense. Bearable is the word that springs to mind.Of course, the end is left open for possible sequels but if one were to appear then trust me, it would be the only surprise to come out of this movie.Overall, not really worth going out of your way for. Teen girls will like it, or course, and that is who it is aimed at. For the rest of us, this isn't very fulfilling.SUMMARY: Harmless but utterly predictable. Marries Twilight and every dystopian future YA story you've seen into one quivering mass of jelluloid. Best avoided unless you are a teenage girl.",The 5th Wave
45,bkrauser-81-311064,They Should Have Stopped at the 4th Wave,3,29 January 2016,"5th Wave represents the absolute nadir of Hunger Games-clone science fiction. This tonally schizophrenic, tedious exercise in survivalist disaster porn has the strong, pungent smell of weepy romanticism that threatens to overwhelm every interesting idea that captures the audiences' imagination. I cannot attest to the quality of the book series written by Rick Yancey but if the quality is anywhere near the level of this messy, disjointed, ambling film then I'm starting to question young peoples' choices in reading material.Cassie (Moretz) is just an ordinary middle-class high school girl living in a quiet suburb in Ohio. She has a loving family and a strong connection to her little brother Sam (Arthur) whom she sings to sleep when he's feeling anxious. Then (ominous music) the ""Others"" come. The Others, an alien race looking to invade, attack humanity with wave after wave of synchronized attacks. They keep their own causalities low by; first cutting the power to the entire globe, destroying coastal cities with tsunamis and earthquakes, modifying the avian flu to cause a massive plague and deploying drones and snipers to pick off survivors one by one. Finally there is talk of a 5th wave that could mark the end of humanity, that is unless Cassie, her brother and a pod of diverse and supposedly original characters can do something about it. Oh and yes, by the end of the movie the pieces are set for the same normal-girl- chooses-between-two-hot-dudes scenario we've seen in everything from The Hunger Games series (2012-2015) to The Twilight Series (2008- 2012)The tone of this film is so incredibly humdrum that it's hard to really care about the fate of any of our protagonists. Family goodbyes and reunions are treated with the same visual bluntness as a tsunami hitting New York City and Cassie herself is so poorly written, that it's hard not to cheer for the Others which prove clever, interesting and emotionally complex by comparison. It's a shame too because under all the unspoken absurdities, tone-deaf directorial choices, and overcooked melodrama, there is a decent story underneath the rubble. There are interesting parallels between The 5th Wave, the Colombian Exchange and the concept of ""going native"" none of which get's explored. Instead of tapping into anything remotely resembling complexity i.e. anything that makes apocalyptic fiction so darn addicting, we get Chloe Grace Mortez gazing starry-eyed at the muscular Alex Roe chopping wood in the backyard.Speaking of our two would-be suitors; Roe plays the earnest and resourceful Evan who has a few secrets up his sleeve. Evan and Cassie share a passionate kiss on the back of a an abandoned station wagon after moments of flirting that involves Cassie being shot in the leg and practicing the art of disarming someone; sexy. Meanwhile, Nick Robinson plays Ben, the high school sweetheart turned military's last hope. When Cassie and her little brother get separated, Ben takes the mantle of little kid protector and is rewarded by Cassie coincidentally appearing at the same place at the same time to do the exact same thing. Both of our supposed Romeos are willing to do anything to protect Cassie who has done nothing to deserve their attention other than wash her hair and exfoliate despite traipsing though the woods for weeks.Stories like ""The Road"" and ""The Last Man"" deal with a total collapse of human systems that we largely take for granted. After the Atomic Age, post-apocalyptic fiction became more popular than ever, seeping into film with such masterworks as Night of the Living Dead (1968), Panic in Year Zero! (1962) and The Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956). We eat it up partly because it's a dark form of wish fulfillment and partly as a challenging ""what if"". The psychology of individuals who deal with the end of the world as we know it intrigues us because we constantly question what we ourselves would do in a similar situation. 5th Wave answers that question in the most asinine way possible...get the hots for like, two different guys of course #winkyface.",The 5th Wave
46,moviexclusive,Familiar yet adequate for casual viewing,6,14 January 2016,"With the conclusion of lucrative franchises such as Twilight, The Hunger Games and the impending end to Divergent, Sony has finally jumped onto the YA adaptations bandwagon by releasing The 5th Wave into theaters this week without an advance critics screening. You might think this is a bad omen. After all, bad or good marketing vibes are still considered as marketing. Surprise.. Surprise.. even though The 5th Wave is not at the same level of the much-acclaimed Hunger Games, it remains for much of the running time a captivating and thrilling watch.Based on a trilogy of books by American author Rick Yancey, the protagonist of the movie is Cassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz), a teenager living in Ohio whose ordinary life is altered after a mysterious alien invasion starts killing every humans on earth. The first wave involved a deadly EMP wave, the second involved massive tsunamis and the third, a deadly plague. Those that survived await the fourth and fifth wave. Aliens dubbed 'the others' took on human forms and start massacring every living human except children. When the army takes Cassie's younger brother Sam away to a refugee camp, Cassie must try all means to get back to Sam even if it means risking being shot by 'the others' and flying drones. Let's face it whether it's on the small screen or the silver screen; it is always aliens or zombies roaming around in a deserted post- apocalypse world. The 5th Wave very much toys and revolves with the same idea and element. In short, mankind is basically doomed. Fortunately, director J. Blakeson knows how to package and tell a familiar story in an entertaining way and as an added bonus, he has a competent actress in the form of Chloe ""Hit Girl"" Grace Moretz onboard.With the tragic loss of her parents, Chloe Grace Moretz is equally vulnerable and tough as Cassie. The opening sequence is so intense that it effortlessly sets the tone of the movie. No doubt, Chloe is such a consummate performer, her acting so flawless that you will almost forgive her stint in the crappy romantic weepie If I Stay. Just like Katniss can't do without Peeta and Gale, Cassie has the help of Evan Walker (Alex Roe), a boy who lived on a farm and her high school crush, Ben Parish (Nick Robinson from Jurassic World) to assist her in fighting her way to Sam. The 5th Wave has a lot in common with The Hunger Games. The main hero is female, caught between two guys and is always ready to step up to protect her younger sibling. Different universe, same character.Of course, The 5th Wave won't win any awards for originality and I'm definitely not saying Yancey is plagiarizing somebody else's work. It is simply a tough act to balance formula and creativity nowadays. In between all the survivalism and action, there are some contrived romantic scenes between Cassie and Evan; but you have to bear in mind this is ultimately based on a teen-centric material. Veterans Liev Schreiber (X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and Maria Bello (A History of Violence) appear as shady military personnel. As to what these two are up to, the less you know, the better.Despite familiar characterizations, The 5th Wave is a glossy, polished product that won't actually stand out in the overcrowded dystopian fantasy genre but warrant for a satisfying weekday viewing. Satisfying meaning the performance and pacing is great with one obvious gripe, you have to pray for two more sequels to know the outcome of Cassie's fate (and who she chooses in the end if you are the nosy sort).",The 5th Wave
47,Screen_Blitz,"Young adult novel adaption shows potential, but wastes it",5,8 May 2016,"January to March are rarely good months for movies that show good cinematic effort, and even more rare that these movies score diamonds at the box office. When it comes to adaptations to best selling YA novels however, there is often hope for fun teen-oriented entertainment that show potential in performing decent, if not strong at the box office. Franchises like 'Divergent' and the first Hunger Games have proved success in the past even reaching more beyond the adolescent target audience. Others on the other hand, have been duds. This film based in the novel series by Nancy Yancey shows to have palpable potential in starting a strong and wildly hyped franchise, but wastes it on a sluggish script and pacing, leaving only impression. Directed by J. Blakeson, the film follows high school teen extrovert Cassie Sullivan (played by Chloe Grace Moretz) who witnesses four deadly waves of alien attacks that leave her town devastated. The first wave begins with an electromagnetic pulse that shuts off all electricity and natural resources, the second wave involves a violent earthquake followed by a massive tsunami that cleans many of the coastal cities, the third wave involves dropping infected survivors in the zones of clean survivors, and the fourth includes alien snipers disguised as humans dropping in. When her younger brother Sam (played by Zachary Arthur) taken away by the U.S military lead by Colonol Vosch (played by Liev Scheiber) who train children as young soldiers, Cassie joins up local stranger Evan Walker (played by Alex Roe) to make her way to the military base where Sam and her friend Ben Parish (played by Nick Robinson) are located while preparing for the lethal fifth wave attack. This post-apocalyptic science-fiction adventure begins with a promise of a powerful, fun- filled journey that could potentially bring on the fun to not only targeted teens but adults as well. Unfortunately, the film wastes an unnecessary amount of time on overcooked exposition and amounts to a story that drags on slowly and offers little action during the first half. The opening minutes of introducing the waves of attacks are interesting though the special effects aren't anything impressive. For the following half-hour or so, the plot involving the main character trying to infiltrate the military base moves at a rather awkward pacing and grows tedious until its the film reaches the second half, while the scenes involving the characters in military training offer some substance, despite borrowing elements from other YA adaptations. If these scenes maybe took the time to develop the characters (especially Liev Schieber's character), viewers would be in for a more engaging narrative heft. Throughout the film, the characters engage in conversations complete with dialogue that borders on the line of laughable, and not in a good way. And the acting doesn't quite shine in some parts. The film does succeed on visual grounds though, such as its realistic representation of a post-apocalyptic setting following the wave attacks. The last forty minutes I believe is when the story begins hitting the right notes, and presents a climax that is both fun and thrilling to watch. The 5th Wave had great potential of kickstarting what could have been the highly popular YA franchise, even if it doesn't level up with maybe The Hunger Games saga. Sadly, it wastes it on its awkward pacing and writing that doesn't level beyond mediocre. This is not to say the film has zeroed its chances of launching a sequel but it definitely needs to make considerable improvements upon writing if it happens to do so.",The 5th Wave

A young woman is separated from her father and young brother and goes on a journey to find them. But now the aliens have taken human form and patrol the forests.The story of the invasion is told very well through the eyes of our main character. The action is fairly light but tense and I was absorbed for the first hour.There is a central theme of subversion and manipulation - I imagine the title is even a nod to the 5th column in the Spanish Civil war. I was having a good time, all set to write a shining review - then the film took a steep dive down the toilet.A romance story -so cloying it would make Snow white throw up down her gown - is injected into the story. Then a bizarre number of coincidences all happen at once to allow the characters to finally catch up with the plot. Then the all conquering aliens suddenly become totally hapless. They are not helped by the fact that one of the characters suddenly becomes a near indestructible super hero. Then the film finishes with no ending, it finally dawned on me.

51,juliankennedy23,Wave this trend goodbye,4,10 January 2017,"The first half hour is decent enough. Heck. The first scene is the best thing in the movie. It's like something out of a Fallout or State of Decay film adaptation. If the movie itself was anything like that first scene it would be fantastic. It isn't.First the positive. Outside of Maria Bello hamming it up, the acting isn't that bad. And that is about it for the positives. The special effects and setting make this seem more like a made for TV or perhaps a headlining Syfy movie rather than a Triple-A theater release. The story telegraphs twists that Ray Charles would find hard to miss. The turncoat good guys practically twist their invisible mustaches. The good guy child soldiers are dressed in black ninja cameo and yet all wear giant led flashlights on their head. I am no military expert but that seems like a no-no. The invading Aliens plan makes zero sense, and each twist brings the film closer into The Happening territory.As someone who can watch the similar themed Red Dawn and leave logic comfortably outside the room, all this doesn't kill it for me. Then the movie goes full Twilight. You never go full Twilight. They were going for Buffy and Angel and ended up with Xander and a Praying Mantis. The romance seems like that between an injured kidnap victim and the creepy guy at the gas station who still goes to high school parties.Poor Chloë Grace Moretz just wants her own YA series to complement her own serious films like Jennifer Lawrence got with The Hunger Games. Instead, she got a ripoff like Shailene Woodley got with Divergent. To make matters worse unlike Divergent, this turkey is unlikely to get the two sequels no one is asking for.",The 5th Wave
52,dave-mcclain,"""The 5th Wave"" is the 21st century's 5th major YA film franchise and brings together the best of the previous four.",7,24 January 2016,"""Nature abhors a vacuum."" As it is with science, so it is with movie studios. Where there is a gap, it will be filled. Four years after the last ""Twilight"" film, the year after the ""Hunger Games"" series ended and the year before the ""Divergent"" and ""Maze Runner"" franchises finish showing teens how to survive the end of the world, 2016 gives us ""The 5th Wave"" (PG-13, 1:52). Based on Rick Yancey's 2013 novel of the same name, ""The 5th Wave"" has taken its place as the 5th major YA movie series of the new millennium, and utilizes elements of the previous four. This film has the love triangle of ""Twilight"" and ""The Hunger Games"", the ""I gotta be me"" sensibility of ""Twilight"" and ""The Divergent Series"", the ""don't look behind the curtain"" plot line of the last three of those film series and the ""girl power"" element of the first three. Lastly, as USA Today's review of the book states, ""The 5th Wave"" does ""for aliens what 'Twilight' did for vampires."" Of course, borrowing from previous stories doesn't mean that this one isn't original, or good.Meet Cassiopeia Marie Sullivan, our newest cinematic YA heroine. As played by Chloë Grace Moretz, Cassie, like other recent strong YA female characters isn't out to save the world. She just wants to save her family from an existential threat, but seemingly has to take on the world to do it. Or maybe I should say take on the other worldly. Cassie lived a normal life in Ohio with her sweet kid brother, Sam (Zackery Arthur) and loving parents, Oliver and Lisa (Ron Livingston and Maggie Siff). She had a bestie named Lizbeth (Gabriela Lopez) and a crush named Ben (Nick Robinson). Cassie was your average high school girl until she reached what her narration tells us turned out to be ""the last normal day of (her) life."" Much like in 1996's ""Independence Day"", a giant spaceship comes out of nowhere, hovers overhead and wreaks havoc on the earth. In ""The 5th Wave"", there's only one ship, but it looks like something co-designed by Guillermo del Toro and Tim Burton – and it's powerful enough to unleash waves of destruction upon earth's inhabitants without any of ""The Others"" even having to show their faces. The 1st Wave is a mammoth electromagnetic pulse which sends the entire planet back to the Stone Age by simultaneously rendering anything with electronics or an engine useless, killing untold numbers of people unfortunate enough to be riding in a car or on a plane at the time. The 2nd Wave is a series of earthquakes which cause tsunamis that swallow up populated coastal cities around the world. The 3rd Wave is a mutated bird flu which quickly wipes out most of the people who survived the first two waves. Cassie's family isn't waiting around to see what the 4th Wave is going to be. They head for the hills.Cassie's family finds a group of survivors living at an old summer camp and doing fairly well for themselves, but the feeling of relative safety is short-lived. The 4th Wave turns out to be The Others inhabiting human hosts in a way that is virtually unrecognizable to other humans. This new threat sets off a chain of events which separates Cassie from the rest of her family. She's on her own as she tries to travel the hundreds of miles to Wright Patterson Air Force Base, where many of the surviving family members have been taken. Along the way she meets Evan Walker (Alex Roe), a handsome young man who has somehow also survived on his own and offers to help Cassie get to Wright Patterson. Meanwhile, Cassie's little brother, Sam is at the base being trained, along with other kids, to be prepared for the 5th Wave and to fight back against The Others. Army Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber) is leading this effort, helped by the tough Sergeant Reznik (Maria Bello). Sam is understandably frightened, but he's among other kids of various ages, with names like Ringer, Dumbo, Teacup and someone from Cassie's past, who is known as Zombie.Most of ""The 5th Wave"" will seem very familiar to many Movie Fans and TV junkies alike. The 1st Wave will remind some of the 2012-2014 TV series ""Revolution"". The visuals of destruction during the 2nd Wave are excellent, calling to mind disaster movies like ""Deep Impact"", ""2012"" and ""San Andreas"". The 3rd Wave is heartbreaking to watch, playing out like 1995's ""Outbreak"" and 2012's ""Contagion"". Cassie's journey looks and feels like a combination of the 2007 Will Smith starrer ""I Am Legend"" and TV's ""The Walking Dead"". The 4th Wave is basically a re-telling of ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956, 1978, 1993 or 2007), while the 5th Wave (and the film itself) is a combination of the four YA movie franchises that I mentioned at the beginning of this review. The blending of so many different influences in this film works well, but more originality would've been nice.I consider that last criticism significant, but not devastating. There is a lot to enjoy about ""The 5th Wave"". Moretz, the J-Law for the second half of this decade, has turned in some great performances over the past few years and does the same this time, making this film and any that follow very watchable. There's ample tension as this film tells its very personal story. Making kids the heroes could have been cheesy well, cheesier than it was. That conceit is clearly YA territory, but director J. Blakeson treats the situation realistically enough that this film may appeal to adults too. As derivative as the film is, it's well-assembled and entertaining enough to ride this wave as far as it goes. ""B+""",The 5th Wave
53,MihaiSorinToma,A good Sci-Fi Adventure,7,27 August 2017,"After Earth is being repeatedly attacked by an alien ship, Cassie, an ordinary girl, must travel through hostile lands in order to recover her lost little brother. She'll have to overcome many perils along the way, but a promise is a promise and it must be kept against all odds.It's a movie which bases its story on a devastated Earth after four waves of alien attacks and presents the adventures of a teenage girl who must venture into the unknown in order to be reunited with her brother. While this doesn't sound like much and it actually isn't as imposing as other premises of movies with similar themes, it manages to create a bleak and desolate atmosphere in which the main character can make her desperate attempt. The special effects are seldom and not very well made if you ask me, but they mostly do their job as far as the story is concerned. Nothing groundbreaking in terms of CGI, that's for sure, which is quite a pity. While the characters are decent in complexity, they don't quite manage to be as sympathetic as I hoped, in order to make the viewer feel sorry for their situation, thus creating a dramatic atmosphere. While the plot seems quite generic and linear, it does bring a couple of twists and turns, more or less expected, which actually do a surprisingly good job in lifting up the standard of the movie and thus leaving a good impression in terms of story. Again, nothing wow but good. The finale on the other hand isn't as well made as I hoped, leaving much to be desired, considering the fact that it is very abrupt and leaves much room for a continuation. It's not a bad thing but it seems like they wanted so much to tell the viewer that there will be a next installment that they forgot that they still have to end this one well though, not leaving it sort of hanging. Overall, I found this movie to be between average and good in every aspect. It's a good watch for somebody who enjoys Sci-Fi and a good adventure with a couple of twists, but nothing spectacular as it could have been. I am unable to point out the exact culprit. It's that kind of movie where good enough was used in every corner, thus ending up with a good enough movie which doesn't manage to stand out from a crowd full of similar movies.",The 5th Wave
54,swilliky,The 5th Wave is silly YA with some interesting alien action,4,28 January 2016,"The 5th Wave is a decent sci-fi thriller with Chloe Grace Moretz leading the way in the fight against the alien invasion. There were some good parts but also some over the top awfulness that gained a few eye rolls and sighs. There isn't much to the plot. Moretz's character Cassie Sullivan survives the first few waves of the invasion pretty easily and the filmmakers wasted the talents of Maggie Siff and Ron Livingston as Cassie's parents. The special effects were good enough. We are spoiled in 2016 when even the throwaway YA ripoff that is scrounging for money can throw some decent explosion and destruction our way.The story takes an odd twist splitting up between Cassie and her younger brother Sam played by Zackary Arthur. He is drafted in the military under the harsh command of adult characters played by Maria Bello and Liev Schrieber. In a strange force of the plot, they push young kids into squads and Sam's squad is led by Zombie played by Nick Robinson of Jurassic World fame. This is the first of Cassie's romantic interests.See more of this review and others at swiliky.com",The 5th Wave
55,jrarichards,"Flawed - but not entirely hopeless - alien invasion story for ""young adults""",6,24 August 2017,"(Non-young) adults like myself happening to catch British Director J. Blakeson's ""The Fifth Wave"" (as based on the successful book of the same name by American author Rick Yancey) are definitely going to feel like spectres at the feast, as at moments this looks quite like kiddie-fare, even though ""adult"" language is occasionally resorted to, and intimate relations at least hinted at. In particular, the makers have to jump through hoops to try to persuade their audience how it can be that alien invaders need to establish an army of Terran kids to do their dirty work for them.Suspension of disbelief is pushed to its limits in this respect.However, at the level of the execution there is surprisingly little wrong here. Like many ""young adult"" offerings, this one largely ditches sentimentality, has a quite high body-count, and looks realistically tough and uncompromising in most places. The acting from star Chloë Moretz is entirely up to the job, Liev Schreiber does his usual pretty good work, and there is quite a bit of fun (seemingly for both actress and audience) out of Maika Monroe as the very sassy ""Ringer"".Other young people appearing in the film (e.g. top-billed Alex Roe and Nick Robinson) seem a little bit to be going through the motions, though - ironically - several non-key members of the youthful Army squad looked potentially interesting as characters, had they been given a little more to do and say.Although effects are really reduced to a bare minimum here, I differ from many reviewers in finding them adequate, and indeed looked upon the unfolding alien-invasion story as reasonably persuasive and quite well-told. Later on, things got relatively predictable (indeed even the plot twists seemed so), but all in all, this is NOT a disaster, and does have at least a few interesting ideas.Needless to say, the piece ends with the ""promise"" of a sequel, given that rather little has been resolved. And, as ever, that kind of thing will prove an annoyance to some.Above all, it remains a little hard to see which target audience will really get most out of this film. How old or young exactly do you have to be? For me the jury is out on that one.",The 5th Wave
56,brookenichole-98054,Wow!,10,4 March 2020,"I really love this movie! The story is so intriguing and devastating. The actors/actresses Chloe, Alex, Nick, Maika, Ron, and Zackary are the best parts of this movie! Their acting is spot on, fantastic, and really shines! The twist at the end is so shocking you never see it coming until it happens! I have never seen Maika or Alex ever in movies or tv shows but they were both equally talented. Alex Roe as Evan Walker was surprisingly great at being the love interest and the fight scenes. His twist is also so shocking that it leaves you so stunned. Maika is strong as Ringer and makes a good character. But, that's not the only thing that was great, the music is so haunting yet beautiful. You can feel the emotions of what the characters are feeling when the music is on. I did read the book and have to say that they are both very similar. Almost spot on. Watch this movie! It is so enjoyable!",The 5th Wave
57,bob-the-movie-man,"Oh Lord, save us from stupid aliens",5,7 May 2016,"As a low-budget sci-fi flick, The Fifth Wave starts quite promisingly with a more logical continuation from the opening scenes of ""Independence Day"". The end of the world is nigh. An alien spacecraft has put itself into a threatening earth orbit (note: actually 'orbiting' - as a nod to science guys like me - rather than just inexplicably hanging there in the sky, as Douglas Adams once put it, ""in much the same way that bricks don't"").The aliens are throwing calamity after calamity down at small-town America in 'waves': earthquakes; tidal surges; modified bird flu; and bombings.Against this stressful backdrop, the ever-reliable Chloe Grace-Moretz (""Kick Ass""; ""Let the Right One In"") plays Cassie who after getting separated from her younger brother Sam (Zackery Arthur) faces the dangers of a cross-country Alabama trek to rescue him.Like I said, quite a promising premise, and it flows quite nicely until the family get to a Fort Wilderness style sanctuary in the forest. There however the plot goes awry, with the aliens making a seemingly ridiculous strategic move.Jaw-dropping dumbness now follows with a 'see-it-coming-from-a-mile-away' plot-twist casting Cassie onto her solo-mission, and the film declines into a rather poor 'Hunger-maze-giance' wannabe with Cassie torn between the affections of old crush Ben (Nick ""Jurassic World"" Robinson) and mysterious saviour Evan (Alex Roe). Much muscle-rippling and skinny-dipping ensues as Cassie oohs and aahs in a girlie fashion that erodes her kick-ass (no pun intended) characterization to date.The director is J Blakeson.... no, me neither. This is only his second feature, and is a big ask.The film rather obviously cues up a sequel: this is the first of a series of – apparently quite good – books by Rick Yancey, with the next in the series being called ""The Infinite Sea"". I don't think I will be rushing to the cinema to see the sequel, if it does happen. A disappointing film that starts with real promise but then loses its way. Grace-Moretz really does deserve better. Nice animated Gif poster though!.(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review, and to comment with your thoughts. Thanks).",The 5th Wave
58,SquigglyCrunch,"Pretty Much Everything is Terrible, But at Least it's Not Boring",3,5 April 2016,"The 5th Wave is based off the novel of the same name. It follows a girl who, after being separated from her family thanks to various waves of alien attacks, sets out to find her little brother. I was personally interested in this movie, mostly to see what the 5th wave itself would be. As far as the quality goes, it's definitely lacking. I liked the plot of this movie. I thought that it was interesting, or at least the idea was. The whole waves thing is a little goofy maybe, and most of the waves weren't particularly original. In fact, most of this movie isn't. Despite this, I liked the ideas for the most part, but they weren't presented well enough. So much of this movie could have been at least pretty good, but it fell short just on how incredibly stupid it could be. There was also one pretty big plot hole right off the bat, and it made the rest of the movie kind of difficult to enjoy. I won't spoil it entirely, but I'll just say that one character knew something that she had no way of knowing. The characters weren't anything special. If anything, the main character was a complete idiot. She makes lots of really stupid choices, but it all works out anyways. It's not that her stupidity is realistic or anything either, she is making legitimately stupid decisions that I can't see any regular human being ever making. She mentions that she's a hardened killer at one point thanks to the apocalypse, but at that point in the story the apocalypse itself only started about a week ago, and it's just stupid. Really? You kill one person in self defense and call yourself a murderer? No, you're stupid, I'm sorry. I don't think anyone would actually think that way either. Everyone else is just fine, but a lot of them are blatantly built around clichés, and the rest of them are poorly developed faces that you don't even care about. The movie keeps switching between two different character's perspectives, which is an interesting idea, but there's so little focus on either character that it makes it difficult to care about either of them. The actors are pretty incompetent too. Don't get me wrong, I like a couple of the actors in this movie, but they just didn't do that great of a job, which made it even more difficult to relate to or care about the characters in any way. The costume choices were pretty bad too. Especially with the characters who were traveling around and surviving and stuff. They were dressed in fashionable, clean, brightly colored clothing. The most clear case of this was with the main character, sporting a nice new brightly colored red hoodie, a couple of ineffective, but fashionable, scarves, and so on. The special effects were pretty bad. Not only did they look bad, but the designs were stupid. Some of the design choices were pretty unlikely and a little dumb looking. Overall The 5th Wave is a pretty poorly made movie, with little to like about it. It's pretty formulaic and predictable, with some stupid ideas added to the mix of good ones. Despite this, it wasn't an unpleasant experience. I didn't not enjoy the movie. It was never boring or anything, so that prevents me from giving it the incredibly negative rating that it deserves. In the end I would never recommend this movie. I did enjoy it, but it's lacking in almost every way.",The 5th Wave

This was on Netflix and in my language too so lets go.And well i liked it !! Yes the movie was slow paced at times, yes there is teenage romance cathering more to young girls, but whatever, i could live with it and even get into it (the relationships).My only issue with the movie is that i feel it would had worked way better as a series. Its already been 4 years now and there was no sequels so i doubt one will ever be made, especially considering Chloe probably changed/grown a lot since then, so i kinda feel a bit ""cheated"" by the movie because i really got into it and feel i was left with an unfinish story, without spoilering anything.Yet for a Netflix time killer and especially into our current situation (April 2020, you know...) , this was fun to watch and i don't regret it at all.",The 5th Wave

The first 30 minutes or so, were kind of fun. A bit too compressed, but fairly entertaining. After that, this film really went off the rails. It felt like the director had no idea what to do with it, and the level of pain I felt, having to endure this, became more and more extreme. I usually walk out of movies, when they are this bad. But, I live far from a cinema, and decided I will endure it, and see if it got any better. It did not. I think if you are a young kid, 12 and under, you might be able to stomach this sort of inane drivel. But, it is hard for me to consider the possibility that adults would enjoy the whole kid soldier routine, and the implausibility of the whole last half was extreme. I cannot more heartily encourage you to avoid this film. If you value your time, there are so many other better things you can do with the time it would take you to watch this absolute garbage. The writing is so bad, that it is impossible for me to imagine how the script got past the executives at the studio. The only thing I can think is that they said, ""well the audience will be mostly dumb kids, so it does not matter"".",The 5th Wave

The global earthquakes and tsunami waves (both literal and figurative) would have knocked out the power. So the first wave just seems to have been unnecessary unless the five waves were not part of an overall plan and the aliens fielded one wave, reviewed the results and then improvised the next wave. If that's true, however, how did they advance their technology to a state where they could travel to earth and affect its global weather when they apparently aren't good at thinking things all the way through? Further, if they can mimic humans why have the waves at all? Why not use what must be superior intellect given all the stuff they know how to do which we don't to become earth's secret leaders and take over that way? The benefit is you get to keep all our cool electronic stuff (Samsung Galaxy Note 7's, self-checkout grocery store machines, etc.)? Basically, for an advanced race, they really needed to spend some more time in the alien conference room whiteboarding out the attack before implementing. I imagine some alien's year-end performance appraisal form took a ding over this dumpster fire. As far as the movie goes, it is just snippets of better movies (""Them!"", every Roland Emmerich movie, ""Divergent"", etc.) woven together into a mildly entertaining melange.",The 5th Wave
63,LloydBayer,"Dull, incoherent and predictable, The 5th Wave is a futile undertaking in an already crowded genre.",3,14 January 2016,"Survival besieged by sentimentality in an end-of-world scenario seems to be the driving theme in an ever increasing list of young adult films. Joining that list, rather late in the race, is The 5th Wave – a pointless save the world mishmash that feels like the retarded offspring between Independence Day and Red Dawn, but without any redeeming qualities from the parents.Going from normal high schooler to gun-toting survivalist, Chloe Grace Moretz's Cassie Sullivan is both the heroine and narrator of this alien invasion for the new generation. The onslaught of the invasion, as explained by Cassie, is unleashed in a series of attacks beginning with power outage (Wave 1), natural disasters (Wave 2), fatal epidemics (Wave 3), followed by parasitic possession of humans as hosts (Wave 4). The first three waves are narrated in short flashbacks, thankfully, as the special effects employed are modest, and that's putting it politely. This leaves us, and Cassie, trying to figure out who's really who, before we arrive at the film's haphazardly written twist reserved as the titular Wave 5.Part of that twist involves a group of child soldiers led by the capable Maika Monroe from last year's sleeper hit It Follows. Monroe's role is an interesting inclusion considering her forthcoming appearance in this year's tent pole offering of the Independence Day sequel. Written as polar opposites, Monroe and Moretz are tasked with shouldering the story from different perspectives. While both deliver, it is the latter's character who reminds us that this is nothing more than a YA film. Cassie's involvement with Evan, an Edward Cullen like mystery figure, not only adds to the overall corniness, their romantic interlude weighs down the story when it is already trying to stay afloat. But even this, although expected in a YA film, is put to use in the most cringe-worthy way possible. You'll know it when you see it.With The Hunger Games laid to rest, and both Maze Runner and Divergent series following suit, all The 5th Wave manages to do is bring left overs to the table in an already crowed pound party. Low key and already lacking in originality, shoddy writing further adds to incoherence and chaos. If that's not bad enough, spoon feeding the narrative dissolves what little mystery there is, resulting in a telegraphed ending. This becomes even more disappointing with the inclusion of seasoned actors like Liev Schreiber and Maria Bello whose only role is authoritative figures. But even they can't save a film as absurd as the idea that only kids can save humanity from total annihilation. By the numbers? It sure is, and as thrilling as hearing someone count from one to five.",The 5th Wave

""The Fifth Wave"" (based on the novel--which I have not read) is one of the worst science fiction movies I have ever seen. It ranks right up (down?) there with John Travolta's humongous mess ""Battlefield Earth."" Cassie and her family live a typical suburban life, which is pretty boring. One day a ginormous spaceship shows up, and aside from dumb looks and blank stares, not much is thought about it. Later, while attending her high school, all power is knocked out: no phones, no cars, no motorbikes--not a single luxury, but I digress. That is the first wave. The second wave is a lot of water. By the third wave, I was about asleep.This gargantuan mess is worse than you can imagine. The Earth is about to be taken over by extraterrestrials (who as most know are all-powerful), but I guess these were on some monthly budget plan because they had to attack in waves. And once the kiddies are separated from their parents by Army goons, the movie becomes absolutely ridiculous. The writers of this turd want you to believe that although these aliens could stop ALL communications throughout the world, create a tidal wave so large that its waters came all the way in from Lake Erie (and surrounding areas), and create a virus that just about decimates the entire population, they would have to use OUR CHILDREN in order to finally take over the planet and be their soldiers?

There's some misdirection in this movie, which keeps the plot exciting, and kept my attention the whole film. Sadly, I don't think this film will do well enough to get a sequel, but even if it doesn't you can still watch it on its own and be satisfied. Some people will not give this film a chance because they think its too much like ""The Hunger Games."" It's completely different. ""Hunger Games"" was not about aliens. Ok, well ""Ender's Game"" was about teenagers fighting aliens. It's nothing like ""Ender's Game"", either. It's completely original. Most of the film did feel kind of ""meh,"" but when the twist came, I forgave that, and was interested to know what would happen next. Considering this movie opened in January which is usually death month for movies that studios think are bad, I really enjoyed it. I thought it would be ""meh"" at best but it was a lot better than I expected. If there's no sequel, I won't care, but if there is, I'll definitely see it.

68,Thrashman88,Surprisingly Good!,8,3 July 2016,"It's a shame ""The 5th Wave"" wasn't a box office hit like ""The Hunger Games"" series because it bears so many similarities without being so pretentious. ""The 5th Wave"" is a mixture of other great Sci-Fi and horror classics. In this day and age in Hollywood, it seems that writing an original and innovative screenplay and movie is almost an impossible task. May I remind those IMDb users who trashed this movie and yet praise ""Hunger Games"", that film is basically an ""americanized"" and ""light hearted"" version of the extremely intense Japanese masterpiece, ""Battle Royale"", so please, if you want ""masterpiece theater"", go and watch some Lars Von Trier or Kubrik stuff. ""The 5th Wave"" is a commercial movie, like so many of its kind, but commercial doesn't always translate into cheap or unimportant. I've read that it is based on a book. I can't say if it's a faithful adaptation, but the movie is well paced, has enough action sequences and a twist here and there that I certainly didn't expect. Shades of ""Independence Day"" and John Carpenter's ""They Live"" are evident throughout the film. ""The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"" and the previously mentioned ""Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" series seemed to have had a big influence in the making of this movie. Chlöe Grace Moretz put on a fine performance and Liev Schreiber has an intense screen presence as usual. I liked the fact that we were watching an alien race taking over the world through the eyes of a teenage girl, without the pre emminent pyro show of an ""Independence Day"" or ""War Of The Worlds"", which I think kept the movie grounded in terms of reality. As with other ""Aliens taking over the earth"" movies, the motivation behind the aliens attack is never fully explained and I would assume they've come for Earth's vast resources in water, minerals, air, trees. There's even a small environmentalist message thrown in for good measure.""The 5th Wave"" is good entertainment if perhaps a bit too derivative of other far more successful movies (and by the same token, successful movies do not always translate into GOOD movies). I do hope the producers get to do a sequel. While not ending in a cliffhanger, the movie's ending lends itself to develop another franchise a la ""Hunger Games"", ""Divergent"" or ""Maze Runner"".

It was sloppy, not so good dialogues and mediocre acting, The 5th Wave is one of the YA movies which shows a lot of promise in its trailer, however nothing good in the movie. With its lacking script and obvious twist ending, this YA movie does nothing much but disappoints. Except the visual effects, There is nothing to watch this movie for.

70,FallenEye,A Breaking Wave,4,18 June 2016,"This movie, is lazy. It doesn't quite come together. The greatest reason as to why it's not completely boring, is that, you spend a large part of the movie just tittering at it's unnecessary flaws. Some critic gave it 9/10 and called it ""a thrilling story of survival"". He's right... I can't believe I survived it. And as for that 9/10... Sony, pay me what you paid them, and I'll happily oblige. 1st Wave: So there's a spaceship hovering inexplicably above, USA, and all that's done, with all the resources, weapons and ""we will not be bullied"" attitude America has, is treat that UFO, like a Cumulus cloud.And the 2nd Wave... Well, that was, uuhhhmm... An actual wave... Of ocean water.The 3rd Wave: A disease is manipulated to kill humans. That's a pretty smart move from ""The Others"". But why stop at just 1 disease. You'd think they'd have an inside man(s), like I don't know, maybe Evan... In the CDC or W.H.O, or something, to unleash all kinds of hell upon our weak mortal form??! I'm just saying...4th Wave: Which one was that again?5th Wave: Absolutely useless. Why? Because the 3rd Wave, could've been an Episodic Wave, however, it was just a drop in the ocean. And the twists... Come on guys... come on... I mean, really... Come on. We all saw it coming... I mean... Come on. Really, the biggest twist to this movie... Is that the 2nd wave, is an actual wave... I mean, that's, just so awesome, right?!Then, these ""Others""??? Who/What are they? Where do they come from? What do they want?

71,FelipeCarrillo,"""The 5th Wave"" or The Divergent Games?",5,19 February 2016,"An almost exact mix of ""The Hunger Games"" and ""The Divergent Series"" One year more, and more best sellers have come. A teenage girl abandoned by her parents, five threatening waves, one brother to the rescue, and a couple of guys to fall in love. ""The 5th Wave"" is an adaption of the book of the 2013 written by Rick Yancey. Its main protagonist is the talented and beautiful Chloe Moretz as Cassie Sullivan, a high school student who is threatened by one group called ""The Others "", she will need to survive in a dystopian world full of dangerous and enemies for one reason his younger brother. Director J Blakeson returns to be in the director's Chair and possibly create a successful and profitable franchise, emphasizing the script created by Jeff Pinkner, Susannah Grant and Akiva Goldsman that gives light to the atmosphere so off. In the beginning, the character played by Chloe (Cassie) is the kind of good American girl cliché of some films. She attends a party up to certain time because her parents are home, loves his brother and sing you a song of good night, it's the same again. This middle class girl suffers a rapid transformation process, it all begins with the arrival of the aliens. Appears momentarily the first wave, a pulse electromagnetic which leaves the town in shock. With a surprising and boring short duration each wave dismantling quickly, each with a duration of about 3 minutes, missed the potential that It had the introduction of the phases. Floods, tsunamis and tidal waves attack the world, establishing a short but sexy scene of Cassie escape and her brother. The third phase is the flu, and shows us the introduction of characters with short duration and unnecessary (Cassie best friend) used only to create a dramatic scene, the same thing again. As it was logical her family seek refuge after harrowing moments. The girl has to deal with horrible things (deaths, falls, lost, pains and all that stuff) but the worst is what gives way to the plot of the film, the abduction of her brother. The training of the young soldiers is very similar to the tone in ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"", taking refuge in a room for everyone and subjecting them to harsh tests. The performance of Maika Monroe (Ringer) was quite successful and arguably is one of the young promises next to Chloe Moretz who truly have the honor to be called ""actresses"". They have arrived and the plot twist of a discovery is maintained in a stable limit, being predictable for some but unimaginable to others. So finally the 5th wave happens, and the argument starts during this. Walk through the dangerous forest with a gun makes see a totally powerful Lady and is on the road where it meets the twin ""Four"" ( The Divergent Series) Evan Walker (Alex Roe) a survivor with secrets who is madly in love with Cassie. The work of Sam Sullivan (Zackary Arthur) is as to the height of the roles of older people, can tell no difference with his companions, this boy have future. ""The 5th wave"" might be more successful if its producer Sony would have expected a little more of time, when the really interesting sagas like ""Divergent"" or ""Maze Runner"" had finished and the hungry young people will ask for new franchises. But they didn't , and now it seems to be an almost exact copy of its competitors. This film was not disappointing, but this was not the best time for Cassie.",The 5th Wave

Yet for some reason, even with all the devastation, Moretz's home seems untouched...equally curious is why her father in the film evacuates the family to a refugee camp...bad move.There must have been a decent pay check on offer for Moretz and veteran Liev Schreiber to work on this turkey.",The 5th Wave

I understand that this is an adaptation to Rick Yancey's books and that in his series the sequel to 5th Wave is Infinite Sea which continues the story of Chloë Grace Moretz' character, ""Cassie Sullivan"" but with the way this film has been panned by critics, the likelihood of a sequel is next to none, leaving this as an unfinished story to stand on it own.",The 5th Wave

Avoid at all costs.,3,21 March 2016,"The 5th Wave is a yet another YA novel adaptation and is about a girl trying to survive with her family when human race is devastated by an alien force, attacking in waves of different types of eradication measures. Now, when it comes to movies based on YA novels, I tend to be a lot more lenient than others from what I've seen. And just like that, I watched this movie with an open mind, despite knowing about the horrible critical reception it got. And well, it really is S**T!! The movie starts off pretty OK, and the whole different waves stuff was kinda cool to see but it lasts for like 10-15 mins, after which the movie nosedives to an ever increasing oblivion of mediocrity. The acting was bad, Chloe Grace Moretz starring in this movie gave me some hope cause I like her but even she was bad. The action sucked, there was no tension whatsoever and it was bland. The pacing was painfully slow, I was bored AF at times. The story was really predictable as well. The big twist was so apparent that I saw it coming a mile away. I kept hoping that maybe the movie will pick up the pace or get better a bit, but nope. One of the main characters got an army code-name of Zombie, which was funny cause the dude looked and acted like a zombie through most of the movie. :pSince it is a YA adaptation, there has to be some sort of romance and boy was it lame and rushed. One moment they just begin getting acquainted and the next they're kissing, like WTH!! Plus, a love triangle is sorta there, and is obviously gonna be a big thing in the sequel, if they make it. Anyway, I hoped that it will have some good things in it but the movie made it really difficult for me to find any. The okay-ish opening is the only somewhat decent thing in the movie.

I'm no writer but I was thinking hey, if they had just said this instead of that it would have been far more plausible. But it wasn't me making it, so the plausible scenarios are instead played out with silly ideas.Still, if you can shrug off the badly done moments, and don't mind seeing the twist come way before I would imagine they hoped you would....

80,metalrage666,5 times the boredom.,2,21 January 2016,"5th wave is not entirely awful but not by much. In a nutshell a large spaceship circles the Earth before settling over the U.S. Over Ohio no less. After some time of no communication an EMP cuts all power over the planet so planes fall from the sky, cars etc are out of control and the planet generally falls into chaos. After that the world's oceans and other bodies of water are displaced and begin to flood all coastal cities killing millions or billions and after that, an altered avian flu kills millions more. These are the 1st, 2nd & 3rd waves. All this happens in fairly quick succession and is told via flashbacks, from there this movie slows down, plods along and never really gets going again. Humans, namely anyone in the military are taken over, the 4th wave, and all the kids and teenagers are inducted into the military to ""help save the planet"", the 5th wave. What started as something promising and action packed, despite not being anything new, very quickly turned into a boring mess of plot twists and what we have is a movie that badly fell off the rails and you knew from only half-way in that it was never going to get back on again. It's getting tiresome to learn that the U.S being yet again the country where all the aliens choose to drop in, where all the answers are discovered and where the world's saviours are. Despite ridding Earth of its technology, resources and vast numbers of the population with no effort, it's good to know that there's a bunch of kids in America that have all the answers and will save us all.

81,lois-lane33,Predictable.,6,1 February 2016,"I think SF films like this are popular because they have the effect of making the audience feel that 'life is normal and the world is fine' when the film is over. The only problem with that subtext is that in reality life is getting downright screwed up for plenty of people these days even if there is no alien invasion coming at any time soon. The premise for making movies like this is that this type of SF is ""good honest escapism"" but I think that disastrous scenarios for Earth are not just the stuff of SF. There is no significant number of electric cars on the road today (even after the idea that relying on oil for energy is bad for Earth's atmosphere has long been established) and we-as a society-are still virtually completely dependent on big oil as our main source of fuel for our vehicles and the thing that balances our economy also. And woe betide anyone who says using so much oil is dumb especially since we can use electricity to power vehicles cleaner & cheaper. Films like this are ""reassuring"" to people because it's all 'just a story.' Maybe big oil is run by aliens. The acting in the film was predictably fair to good and the special effects were predictably minimal. There were exactly three other people in a cinema that could easily accommodate about 300 people when I saw this film on a weekend matinée showing in the early afternoon. Apparently people also don't go to the movies on the weekend anymore either.",The 5th Wave
82,paul_3-960-896774,The fifth misopportunity,6,26 January 2016,"The 5th Wave book was a pleasant surprise when I read so I was looking forward to the movie. Chloe Grace Moretz as Cassie made sense to me, alleviating any worries I might have had about a silver screen adaptation.Beat by beat the movie reflected the book. It was nice, at first, to see it take form but that feeling kind of died down. The movie wasn't hitting all the marks. The comedic was off, the the acting wasn't always amazing, but overall the biggest problem was the pacing. They tried to cram a lot in a limited amount of time and failed to time it out perfectly. It's not clear how much time goes by, which makes bonds between the characters look too weak for them to care that much about one another, or the skills these kid soldier have really easy to acquire.The few changes they made to the story was smart, and some of the action scenes were well done, but these efforts became obsolete with the way the movie was directed and edited. And for some obscure reason I feel like the budget was spent poorly. I don't know why, I guess it looks that way.The 5th Wave remains an entertaining movie but it feels more like a teen flick for prepubescent tweets than a Young Adult movie.By @garcwrites",The 5th Wave

84,barbagvido,"The book itself was a wasted potential, but this is really bad",3,26 March 2016,"I read the book because I heard the movie is coming out and I also heard the book is very good. And also, YA sci-fi and fantasy franchises are my biggest guilty pleasure. The book had an incredible start, but the middle was basically Twilight with aliens and bringing romance in the book almost completely destroyed it. Then the end of the second and the whole third act were great, but then it ended totally out of nowhere. I think have never read a book with such an abrupt ending.But enough about the book, let's talk about the movie. The movie as an adaptation kinda reminded me of Eragon. In a bad way because how the hell could anything remind me of that movie in a good way? It has the most important parts of the plot, but only THE most important. And it all feels so rushed and so cheap even tho the movie itself isn't. The beginning of this movie was very good, just like the beginning from the book and it followed the first act decently. Then it rushed to the third act and almost completely skipped over the second act. The second act was kinda boring, but to include some parts of it in the movie wouldn't hurt because it would develop the characters more. Instead, this feels like one of the most rushed movies of all time. Too bad because they had some really talented actors and they could also fix the book's mistakes. And they tried, but they didn't do it right and they completely messed it up. CGI is also pretty lame and at some parts you're feeling like you're watching a B movie from early 2000s. Acting is pretty good, but it feels so wasted. Chloë Moretz is as great as always and Maika Monroe and Nick Robinson were also decent. I didn't even notice the others. Except maybe that terrible child actor that plays the brother of the main character Cassie. I barely noticed Liev Schreiber and I love Liev Schreiber. He is the main villain of this movie and he only appears in few scenes. Too bad, because he's the best actor in this movie and in my opinion one of the most underrated actors ever.So, this is another wasted potential. They tried to fix the source material, but they ruined it even more.

85,djangozelf-12351,As a movie the 5th wave does not make sense.,1,20 March 2016,"I started out still wanted to like this movie but it does not take long and it all starts to feel way familiar.It has all the PG-13 clichés and it borrows heavy from a bunch of other movies. One of my first thoughts was a mix of ""red dawn"" and ""puppet masters"". Certainly reminded me also of all the latest ""teen dystopian"" movies like ""hunger games"" or ""divergence"".All of that but than without even an attempt to write a story were this alien invasion actually makes sense. There technology seems inferior to ours and the 5 waves sound like game logic instead of something that can exist as a strategy in reality.I like Chloe Moretz Grace but I think she phoned it in with this one but I also felt there wasn't much chemistry between any of the actors. It all felt very bland and the Grey buildings most of this takes place in even amplifies that.Most action scenes take place in the dark and the romance was forced and I hate the way Chloe reacts when she sees this guy shirtless like some gooey eyed princess from Disney.And than...the big open ending,the fight continues I guess? The 5th wave part 2?! or did they figure out later on they got the title all wrong?This feels like it was written in the nineties because it has an outdated story but it could also be a poor adaptation from the book(I mostly watch movies).It looks rushed and feels like a last cash grab before the hype dies down.Mediocre with a capital M.Up next for Chloe Copy is...the little mermaid(mmm?, Meh!)

The future is a scary thing and we know sooner or later some truly bad stuff is gonna start happening around us. This flick gives us some idea of the possibilities. The sequence where the army shows up to ""help"" was especially well done and creepy. Stuff just like that has happened all over the world many times in the past and even today. The chaotic results of a world turned upside down are pretty well realized and the acting was fine although not a lot was asked of the cast. I think most people will like this, its action with sci fi and a bit of 1984 thrown in to make you shiver a bit. A good one.

It's after 5, and so far it hasn't snowed where I am but it will be snowing all day tomorrow in this historic snowstorm. The movies will probably lose business this weekend because of this snowstorm affecting lots of people. However, I was able to go to a matinée with a couple of friends before the snowstorm hits this afternoon.Let me tell you, this movie was a good movie. Not like my favorite movie, and not a movie I'd probably own a copy of. But, an enjoyable action movie to see with a popular actress who is no longer a child, Chloe Grace Moretz, who plays a high school student. We also recognize another actor in this movie from Jurassic World, one of the highest grossing movies of last year, Nick Robinson.Alien invasions have long since been a plot of movies. Occasionally, aliens come in peace like they do in movies like E.T., Race To Witch Mountain, Earth To Echo etc. Sometimes aliens come for war, where there are numerous movies with that plot. Even a radio broadcast in the '30s causing people to actually think aliens were attacking, ""War Of The Worlds.""This movie resembled some other movies we probably have seen. The action seems like action we've seen in other movies. I thought the beginning of the movie resembled alien movies we're familiar with, like Independence Day and War Of The Worlds. It resembled both movies when characters were looking at the ship, but I thought it resembled War Of The Worlds with Tom Cruise a little more than Independence Day, especially with the tactics the aliens were using to wipe out the human race. I felt like a couple of their waves resembled other films like The Day After Tomorrow, and Deep Impact, as the tsunami scene reminded me of the one in The Day After Tomorrow.But, I felt like this movie more so resembled recent movies and stories we are more familiar with like The Hunger Games and Divergent. The girl in this movie Cassie, kind of resembles Katniss Everdeen. I felt more so that her guy interests in this movie resembled the guys in Hunger Games. Like, Ben resembled Peeta and Evan resembled Gale. The training in this movie also seems somewhat similar to the training in Hunger Games and Divergent.What we see is one of the main themes of this movie, is an older sister Cassie wanting to protect and be with her brother Sam. It was nice to see Cassie's close relationship with her younger brother. I'll tell you seeing their relationship reminded me of another film we're less familiar with, R.L. Stine Haunting Hour Don't Think About It. The girl in that movie played by Emily Osment played a character with the same name as the character in this movie, Cassie. So, when we hear Sam call out Cassie, that reminded me of The Haunting Hour. Though, Sam was a braver character than the kid in Haunting Hour, and those two were closer as brother in sister in this movie than the two in Haunting Hour.This movie was entertaining, but leaves out a couple of things. One thing, is we wonder how many people are supposed to die in this movie? We see brief scenes where the waves take place, but the movie mostly seems to focus on the war, strategy of survival, and Cassie looking for her younger brother. It's also interesting that with all the destruction in this movie, a lot of the movie takes place in a peaceful forest where nothing seemed to happen. Cheap scenes they could easily shoot with no special effects for those scenes. Now, going along with my title, Calm Before The Storm, the action seems to start at once when the waves and then it calms down somewhat till the next wave.I felt like this movie could have also had more character development and allow us to get to know the characters better, because the movie starts with the action pretty soon after it starts. I feel like we have to know the characters a little better to get to like them and care for them more, to make a really good movie, before we go to the action. Though, the characters in this movie are likable.Sorry if this mostly has been comparing this movie to other movies and talking about what went wrong. But, I feel like we could see similarities to other movies in almost every movie we watch. This movie will leave us wondering if there's going to be a sequel, and it's something we will want after watching this movie. I hope there is, and since I haven't read the books I'm really curious to find out what happens next?So, while I've compared this movie to Hunger Games and Divergent, action movies where the main characters are females like this one. This movie seemed to have more action than those movies, except the last Hunger Games movie. I thought we saw Chloe Grace Moretz in action that we normally do not see female characters in. Especially, high school aged in that kind of action. If you like action movies, and like Chloe Grace Moretz, then this movie is definitely for you. I give it an 8/10. There should have been more character development, and we should have gotten to know the characters better. But, it was still pretty good!!",The 5th Wave

The budget is blown by the 4th wave which happens to pretty much be done 10 mins into the movie. Other than that it is love triangles, awkward conversations between teen boys and and girls and young , independent girls saving the day - girl power.

The acting was very convincing. The storyline kept me involved throughout. Although aimed at a teenage audience our adult daughter informed us she had already seen it as well as reading the book.
There is enough variety to appeal to older audiences and I'd you like kids then you will enjoy the youth.
There is a twist or two along the way and the movie ends on a reasonable note without closing off the story or leaving you up in the air. It makes you think as well. It is not mindless alien rubbish.

99,brutzel,Quite Good,7,7 June 2016,"Okay, I did think this was a surfing movie. No, it's a movie about an alien (from outer space) invasion that comes upon the Earth in waves and much of the Earth is destroyed. The aliens are called ""The Other"" and can inhabit a human host so no one knows who can be trusted. The reason the aliens come is because they need the Earth and the humans are in their way. Oh, oh. Cassie (Chloe Grace Moretz) is on a mission to retrieve her brother Sam (Zachary Arthur) who was taken by the military to be trained to be a soldier to fight The Other. The movie goes along at a good pace and we never know what will happen next. We see Cassie team up with Evan Walker (Alex Roe) to help get her brother from the military base. Can she trust him?There is a major twist later on and because of this we know there will be sequels, maybe numerous ones. There is nothing uncomfortable or scary in here and it's a lot better than I thought at first as we follow Cassie and hope for the best. I was kind of amazed that Cassie could look really young at times and later on look more adult-like. (movie magic). Later on we will see Maika Monroe as Ringer who helps train the children at the military base and she becomes a breath of fresh air and we wished she had more screen time. Notables: Liev Schreiber as Col Vosch the Commander of the military base; Maria Bello as Sgt Reznik, the Head Nurse who screens children for military service; and Ron Livingston as Oliver, Cassie's father.All in all this is quite good and we will see sequels.

105,michael-3204,Wake me for the 17th wave,3,27 April 2016,"There is an intriguing idea buried in ""The 5th Wave""'s muck -- exploring the relative ease with which alien invaders could conquer humanity by co-opting gullible youth and using them against us. It's a clever twist on the classic ""Twilight Zone"" episode ""The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street"", in which aliens turned human neighbors against each other by sowing suspicion and mistrust in their ranks. But ""The 5th Wave"" does all it can to extinguish anything remotely interesting in favor of trite teen romance, inept dialogue and astonishingly poor performances even from actors who are usually reliable. I didn't think it was possible for Maria Bello to overact as much as she does here, or for Liev Schreiber to be so dull. I wonder how this happens -- is it incredibly poor direction, or does the cast realize that the material they have to work with is so sub- standard that it doesn't make any sense to try to do good work?The cynical thing about this film is that most of humanity is dispensed with in what amounts to an extended prologue, in what the story contends are the first four waves. This is mostly depicted through uninspired CGI. Once all those pesky people are out of the way, the remarkably unaffected survivors can focus on making one stupid move after another, led by a bunch of privileged and under- educated high school students who should have paid more attention in biology class instead of texting each other about cute boys. There are no actual characters here who behave in ways that are recognizably human, so in this film's universe it is perfectly plausible that Chloë Grace Moretz's Cassie would fall for a hunky stranger when she happens to spy him bathing, or that Maika Monroe's goth-chick bad girl turns up as a fully formed stereotype and is immediately embraced by her colleagues. Those aren't even the most implausible elements of the story, but the rest involve spoilers. ""The 5th Wave,"" unfortunately, does a great job of spoiling itself.",The 5th Wave
106,fluturoj,Engaging,7,16 August 2016,"The real-life link: I think the main idea behind this movie (or the book based on) is to show what makes us human, to emphasis hope and other things that make us human. Well, the movie talks about it but does not show it, it does not give examples of that. The kids did not survive because they had hope but because they were lucky (yes lucky, lucky that the alien somehow fell in love and won Cassie fights). So no, there is not much real life reflection or thinking that this movie stimulates. But, considering that it is supposed to be more action and entertaining and targets a young audience, the lack of serious topics should be expected and accepted. Plausibility: far, far from plausible. OK, the super airlines get defeated by a single James Bond alien. Well, I don't buy that. If the others are so smart, why is it so difficult for them to kill the remaining ones. Why would they need kids for that (are they just cruel?) why are they wasting time? Why do they need kids for? If they need earth only, why are they not killing the kids and everyone else and get it over with? So yeah, their actions are not plausible. Character analysis: none of the characters is deep enough to be analyse. So a poor job in terms of the depth of characters. Casting: I liked Chloë Grace Moretz. Alex Roe not so much. I would the performance and acting to be a bit amateur.Storytelling: One could tell from the very start that the army was the others. So their big great surprise was not a surprise to the audience. What I liked however was that whenever you thought that this is not plausible (as she is walking alone in the woods full of other and is not getting killed?) was explained in the end (Walker was looking out for her); or their cars are working and they are not being attacked (they were the others) so this sort of implausibilities were explained in the end.Overall, it is an interesting movie, it keeps you engaged.

Do we really need another one of these films with an overly used and tired plot? I suppose so--or at least that is what Sony Pictures is hoping for. Once again, the world is at the brink of destruction by an alien race that has taken over most adults. It is up to a small band of rebel young people to save the world by overcoming the impossible. Only this time, the dialog and plot are so incredibly blasé that you may likely find yourself often glancing at your watch to see when this painful movie will be over. Can we survive the fifth wave??? That question is all too apropos. From the unimpressive digital effects to the crazy quilt consisting of pieces and patches from every other YA fantasy action thriller, hopefully this movie signifies the last wave of boring and predictable franchises that try to compete with The Hunger Games but fail miserably.I normally summarize the plot here, but I am pretty well sure that you already know all that you need to know, given the repetition of such films in this sub-genre of young adult movies.If you simply enjoy mild, mindless, cliché young adult (trying so hard to appeal to teens and adults) entertainment, then this film is for you.

114,keyope,A mixed bag,7,22 March 2016,"The 5th Wave has received very mixed reviews so I went into it prepared for it to be terrible. In places it is pretty bad but there is also a lot to like about it. Chloe Grace-Moretz and Nick Robinson are very good and their characters (although not particularly deep) are very likable, probably thanks to the actors. The first 30 minutes was very entertaining although at times it felt a little rushed. Maybe this would have worked well as a TV series. Anyway after a particularly interesting plot twist at the half hour mark the film's pace completely grinds to a halt and becomes a soppy teen romance like Twilight for the middle portion of the film. And suddenly Grace-Moretz's character becomes the least interesting thing in the film for a while. Nick Robinson then has to carry the film for half an hour which he just about manages in spite of an endless 'wave' of movie clichés (think Twilight, Hunger Games, Divergent etc) that come thick and fast. There are also a number of long scenes filmed in the dark where it's really difficult to see anything. At times it's like listening to a radio play because you can't see much at all. Towards the end the tension ramps up nicely in a few places, so even though it looks like there wasn't much of a budget (some scenes look horribly cheap) the director did get me on the edge of my seat. I haven't read the novel that this is based on but you can tell that the source material is good because there are some decent surprises here. Liev Shrieber adds weight to every scene he is in even though he doesn't have lots to do. Overall I think this could have been better received if 20 minutes in the middle had been chopped out along with some of the tiresome clichés that blight these types of movies. But those twenty minutes or so (and the clichés) that I disliked were clearly aimed at the teenage girl demographic rather than sci-fi and action fans. If a sequel does get commissioned I would probably watch it because I did enjoy this more than any of the Hunger Games movies (I'm probably in a minority there though) and it was better than all bar the first Twilight movie. This film is worth your time unless you really can't stand the teen romance parts.",The 5th Wave

116,ryanmark-57919,Easily a Contender for Worst Movie of the Year,3,29 January 2016,"Wow, I didn't know what to expect from this movie but I know I didn't expect anything this wretched. I'm not usually this negative about films like this but this just turned out way worse than I thought it would. What makes it more sad is that it looks like there was some potential here. Some of the cast is actually pretty good and the story sounded interesting enough on paper. The film just never seems to do anything really great. The good parts of the movie are just okay while the bad parts are straight up horrendous. The film was directed by a guy named J Blakeson, and to be honest with you I have no idea who this is so I can't really comment on his past work. Let's get to the story.The plot is about a young woman named Cassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz) and basically the end of the world from alien invasion. In order to weaken humanity, the aliens, or the ""Others"", used natural disasters, super diseases, and more in what was referred to by the humans as waves. Now, a 5th wave is about to start and everyone is freaking out about it. Meanwhile, Cassie has become separated from her younger brother Sam (Zackary Arthur) and goes on a journey to a military base to find him. What she finds will change the course of humanity forever.There's actually a few people on this cast that I usually enjoy but even they couldn't save this film. I was especially surprised to see Liev Schreiber but I wasn't surprised that he was the best thing about the movie. I was disappointed in Moretz but I don't think it was completely her fault. She brought as much emotion to her character as she could but the dialogue was so awkward that I don't think anyone could really do a whole lot with it. Honestly, no one else really stood out to me for any excellent performances. It's nice that they got a little bit of talent for this movie but it didn't really seem to help them out much.The world appears to be in decent shape despite the advent of the Others. The vehicles don't work anymore but everything is surprisingly clean and sterile looking. To be fair, we don't actually see much of anything except a quaint country house and a military base but it's nice to see that our alien overlords will leave all of our stuff alone.The main thing that takes this movie from just mediocre to straight up bad is the second act of the film. There's a good deal of time spent in the middle of the story where we either see Cassie wandering around the forest flirting with her new boyfriend or we get to hear some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard from some emo girl and a guy that everyone has decided to call Zombie (ooh, edgy). The movie's not very long but this whole part drags so much that it just becomes grating after a while. I honestly feel like the beginning and end of the film were at least slightly entertaining but the middle is so awkward and just straight up bad that it becomes hard to stomach after a while.There's not really a whole lot more for me to say about this one. The dialogue is what really brings this whole thing tumbling down. The young adult tropes also don't do anything to make this movie any easier to take. I haven't read the book so I can't really comment on the quality of the writing there but this movie has some of the worst I've ever heard. I hate to come off as negative since I actually enjoy some of these young adult adaptations but this one just didn't do anything for me. I honestly can't give this one any kind of recommendation at all.",The 5th Wave
117,leosmith-11166,A Shamefully Unoriginal Film,3,13 January 2016,"What a pile of stinking crap this film is. The fifth wave has gone down the path of many other teen movies. It takes a genre and teenizes it, not unlike how twilight did with horror, or how The Hunger Games and Maze runner did to the action genre. Corny Jokes that are aimed at teenagers and and unnecessary ""plot twists"" and ""romance"" add up to a painful viewing experience. If there is one thing to say about this film(which i have endless things to say), it is that this film should of never been made. The only reason I can see as why these so called filmmakers made this film was to make some petty cash and keep teenagers out of trouble for 2 hours. I couldn't write this review with aknowledging the unoriginalness of this film. It steals from many a greater film, like Independence Day and War of the Worlds. When the spacecraft is seen for the first time by the public, you can't help but think it is made shot by shot like the scene in Independence Day. A kid goes outside, looks up, his parents come out and look up to see a UFO. They then see their neighbors packing up and leaving. A much worse crime of unorigininality is what the ""Others"" look like. The "" Others""( which is the name the humans give the aliens, original, I know) grow on the human brain and they look extremely similar to the Alien that grows on Kane's face and then burst through his stomach in Alien. And when I say extremely similar, I mean this thing is almost exactly the same. I don't care if the filmmakers are going to make a crappy film, but don't steal ideas from on of the greatest Sci-fi/horror films of all time. Design your own stupid creature for God Sake.Another important thing to say about this merciless film is the plot twist, humour and romance. I won't say anything about this plot twist (just in case any of you are into wasting your time and money on pieces of crap), and to be honest I don't want to talk about idiotic humour and sappy romance, but I will say this. The relationship between a few of the characters is a bit of a Katniss/Gale/Peeta situation. You know, like there's two friends who like each other, but then comes another guy and it makes things awkward. These filmmakers must be pretty low to still ideas from the Hunger Games...To wrap this review up, I would just like to warn anyone who is thinking of seeing this to not.

Well luckily for you you don't have to choose one in this film because you get all 4 elements in one film. The screen writing was done in a way that makes you believe that ""1000 monkeys typewriter"" thing is true. I can't explain why but it's terrible. If you see it you'll understand. I've liked Chloe grace moretz since 500 days of summer came out and watched her films ever since and I can honestly say this is by far the film where she was forced to give her worst performance to date. The cast for this film look quite promising but it seems that even Liev Schreiber is just taking on roles to get his IMDb list longer or his pockets fuller or perhaps he got fooled into this one by not being given a script beforehand to see what a horrible role he would receive. I don't know how these people got convinced, maybe they were brainwashed (pun intended) but if you want to remain fans, stick to their better films and avoid this one. The CGI is almost on par with the PS2 games' graphics I used to play as a kid. The water (which I know takes a lot of rendering when made with CGI) looked like some sort of blue or grey gooey stuff rushing in at almost 37 frames per second while Chloe runs away at 24 frames per second. Now call me a purist if you want, but these things matter when trying to create a realistic looking flood. And believe it or not but things actually get worse as the ""bad guys"" are distinct from humans when you put glasses on that make them look like a 1980's arcade game version of the mask by Jim Carrey. This was perhaps the worst feature of the film, that they used arcader graphics for a futuristic tech device. Then finally we reach the camera work... Besides the only scene with action in the entire film being to dark to see anything and forcing you to rely on your own imagination formed by the sounds they play you, the camera-work was probably done by some kids who constantly tried to blow into the camera lens-arm to get the sound out of whatever trumpet thing they thought it was.. This would explain the inconsistent head shots, unnatural movements and bad angles being used. To be fair to all the departments I've just criticized in this review, they did the best they could with one of the worst written scripts from the 21st century.

After vampires and zombies young kids now have to run around in camos and swing assault rifled to make a story. If this is a depicture of what our culture is becoming, we don't need any aliens to attack us. Are there no more good stories to tell, no imagination left? There is so much wrong with this movie, I couldn't list it all up in a review. Alien invasion to occupy Earth is ... just a lame arse story. Biological beings would not travel the vast distances of space to find another planet because of - distance. And radiation. They can take over human hosts - well, here we are in fantasy land again. If they could take over humans there would be NO REASON FOR VIOLENCE EVER. Showing their ship in the sky is just plain stupid, just stay hidden and take over politics -in the end you get what you want. Using birds flew or whatever doesn't do the trick, why not use something that really kills people in masses? You don't need birds to spread the disease - humans are very good at that on their own. All the ideas in the movie will only convince nine years olds.Please, produce fantasy movies, even ones that lack any sense of reason and are about cheesy kids' romance dreams, but stop making army recruitment movies for teenagers. This is just sick. They still try to shove sci-fi ideas from the 40s and 50s down our throats, just as if nothing had been discovered since then. Evil tentacle parasite aliens that take over our minds - gosh, when did I hear about that the last time? Actually the only reason to write the books was easy money (hey YA is a cash cow), and the only idea the film producers had was - take that girl from Kick Ass and put an assault rifle in her hand. But make her look weak, you know - like girls should be - the mascara wearing bitch part is already taken by another actress - and bring in some guys she can fall for... good looking killer with a sweet heart - like that wolf guy from that vampire movie. Show soldiers and army stuff, that's cheap, no fancy CGI with tactical weapons and crazy stuff - that's not heroic. Some disaster effects would be nice...you know Emerich style... tsunami and earth quakes, I mean those little squish-heads in their spiky supership can make the Earth shake like crazy with the flick of a switch, can't they? And they will come up with a fail safe plan, pitching the youth of the planet against eatch other in deadly gun fights simply by telling them a hokuspokus story. retch",The 5th Wave
124,draciron,Worth watching but twists are predictable.,6,23 May 2016,"This is obviously the first installment of a series. The acting and special effects are very good. The plot is interesting but loses a lot of momentum trying to build plot twists that are far too predictable. In many ways this is a clone of the Insurgent/Mockingbird movies. There are also many subtle political statements, statement being a bit too strong a word. Mild suggestions would be a better term. I gave this a 6. Worth watching, enjoyable but nothing to write home about either.If you liked the Mockingjay and Insurgent series this series will be right down your ally. There is enough Heinlinisque kinds of story to be of interest to Sci-Fi fans, though the themes are almost diametrically opposite Heinlin. The science is loose but not really a distraction.

125,Erlik_Han,If you can suspend your disbelieve it's pretty decent,7,12 February 2021,"Quite honestly it's far superior to most YA book movies. It's far superior to divergent etc for example.The problem is that the plot is full of holes and makes little sense. But the acting is surprisingly good. Again far superior to the average YA movie. The obligatory romance was done pretty well. Although the age difference is a bit creepy. This is something a lot of YA books / movies do. Take a 16yo girl protagonist and have some 25yo dude be one of the love interests. They hinted at a love triangle for the next movie (which obviously isn't happening) which is dumb. Why does every movie targeting YA and middle aged women need a love triangle. It's a giant pet peeve of mine. The romance was actually pretty well done and developed, eventhough the guy was much older and had a ""love on first sight"" then stalker type real going on.The action and characters were ok. The story was ok if you don't mind how nonsensical the aliens are, and how they can wipe out humanity in a million different and much easier ways. How their technology is centuries if not millennia more advanced then ours and still their methods are antiquated etc. If you can look past that it's actually pretty entertaining. The twists can be seen from a mile away.Chloe was great. Although she looks so young that the romance part felt creepier.
Kinda wish they made a second movie to continue the story. I guess this one didn't sell. I mean I had never heard of it before and I love sci fi, dystopias and post apocalyptic stuff (reason why I watched it despite my aversion to YA stuff). I saw it on Netflix and out it on thinking even if it wasn't good it might be so bad it's funny or good. It was decent overall..maybe it's the alcohol making it better, idk",The 5th Wave

I gave it a 3 solely on the performance of CGM who did a masterful job despite pedestrian script and some awful acting by her peers.If this was the very first movie a person watched in their lifetime the plot could not have fooled an utter idiot. From his first appearance on screen the ""Army"" colonel was uncovered as one of the ""others"". And Ben was easily discovered as one of the ""others"" - after all, how could he remain undetected in the house with ""others"" walking all around him? And the squad commander who inserted the trackers in the captured humans - her leering smile gave her away as one of the bad guys immediately (not to mention it would not have been so easy to remove the trackers since they were like those used to identify lost animals and are not removable without surgery).And why would the ""Army"" use school buses to transport the adult humans to an Air Force base? When Cassie and Ben are running through the woods they are overflown by several ""others"" in some sort of aircraft yet remain undiscovered. They could have easily been detected by infra-red cameras and certainly an advanced culture such as the ""others"" would at least have that.The character of Ben makes no sense at all. He is an ""other"" but then he is not. Other than spending the night in the Jeep with Cassie there is no indication that he has been changed by falling in love with her.It is a damn shame that Rod Serling couldn't live forever and instead left drivel like this for us to watch.

128,thecrafts-66710,Another teen apocalyptic movie,5,12 May 2016,"If I were 16 years old, I'd probably rate this movie higher; no offense intended for teenagers. As an older adult who loves sci-if, this was an average and predictable movie along the lines of Hunger Games, Maze Runner, Divergent, The 100, etc. As you find out in the first few minutes, aliens have invaded earth and they are NOT benevolent (would somebody please make a new movie about KIND aliens?). The title comes from the fact that the aliens hit the earth with various waves of attack - think Moses and the plagues. The 5th wave is soon to arrive and most of the movie revolves around this pending event. This is all stated in the movie description above so I don't consider this information as a spoiler. The star of this movie is a high-school cheerleader named Cassie who tries to keep her family intact and whose main responsibility is looking out for her younger brother Sam. I can't say much more without giving away some of the movie and throwing in spoilers. But, again, if you are a teenager (or very young at heart) and like apocalypse movies, then you might enjoy this one. Overall, good entertainment.

130,info-12388,Two stars only for the lake scene,2,30 May 2019,"It's difficult to imagine what was through the minds of the cast and directing crew when they were making this sad little bombette. The big ""twist"" of the actual fifth wave was pretty well telegraphed twenty minutes before we saw it and just left me wondering why aliens would go to so much trouble to eradicate a species so stupid as to make this movie in the first place. Kudos to the lead: she apparently did all her own stunts and carried them off nicely, even as she demonstrated an acting range that ran the gamut from A to E, perhaps F. But what was the point of giving the hero this apparently stunning fight sequence if it's shot in almost complete darkness?But so much of the film is WTH? The invaders recruit kids to shoot each other after their parents have been gunned down? They spend weeks turning them into little mini-Rambos for this? Cool uniforms? Special helmets? Was any of that supposed to make sense when all they really needed to do was park the school buses in an aircraft hanger and then blast it to bits? None of it made sense, and I cant believe they actually thought they'd get a marketable franchise out of it.Its sole redeeming feature? The brief scene where the hero is taking a bath in a lake. That was some stunning footage. Pity his acting chops didnt also rise to the occasion.",The 5th Wave
131,the_bluesman,Chloë fans won't be disappointed!,4,14 January 2016,"The movie's strong point is hands down Chloë Grace Moretz's top- notch acting performance. She always delivers and that's the main reason to see this movie.I have to say beforehand that I have not read the novel by Rick Yancey. I hear that this film adaption follows the novel pretty closely. It seems that Yancey himself was somewhat involved in the making of the movie as he visited the set and such, and pretty much gave his approval. The movie opens with a very powerful scene in which we follow main character Cassie Sullivan (Moretz) into a remote gas station to find food. She's been on her own in the wilderness for some time now and always carries a rifle or a gun to protect herself. Inside the gas station she encounters a strange man sitting on the ground saying he needs help. It is a very threatening situation for Cassie as she cannot be sure that the man is actually a human being or one of 'the others', aliens from outer space who want to wipe out humanity. When she sees something metallic flashing from beneath his jacket, she panics and shoots the stranger dead thinking that he is armed and dangerous. As it turns out he was just holding a small cross in his hand. Cassie is devastated and shocked beyond belief...A very effective way to begin a movie. What makes this opening scene so powerful for me is that Chloë Moretz really conveys those emotions of sheer fear and utter disbelief perfectly with her very precise facial expressions. She is excellent. Even after years of following her stunning career, it still baffles me how capable an actress Chloë actually is, especially considering her still young age. Her acting is very natural and convincing. She should definitely be recognized as one of the great actresses of her generation in the near future if you ask me. She is immensely talented.Now, did I like the movie? I'd say yes for the most part but there are certain elements that I didn't find that convincing. Overall it is a pretty decent adaption of a young adult novel. It has some good action and surprisingly much violence for a PG-13 rated movie. The cinematography is decent and even great at times and Henry Jackman's score is good. The story is pretty formulaic and does not offer any real surprises except for maybe one or two twists that you can see coming, though. What I found really problematic is that the movie starts with a number of very strong scenes but gets duller slowly but surely after that. Most of the scenes that made it into the trailer are actually from early in the movie. Go figure! I found that the first half of the movie—in which you see Cassie briefly in her normal teenage life, then the quite impressive but all too short catastrophe sequences, and then Cassie surviving alone on the road—is much more captivating and engaging and overall much stronger than the second half, which follows a typical sci-fi war movie formula lacking real creativity.The movie begins in a post-apocalyptic world very reminiscent of ""The Walking Dead"". There are actually a number of scenes later on—like the one on the deserted highway with the abandoned cars—that could be straight out of a ""Walking Dead"" episode and I found myself a few times suspecting to see a walker jump on Cassie any minute. Then there are scenes reminiscent of movies like ""Red Dawn"", ""District 9"", ""Independence Day"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatcher"". Good fun.The second half isn't on par with the first one. Somehow the story falls apart midway through the movie. Many events feel too rushed and uncreative once Cassie and Evan are heading for the military base. The movie then becomes a weird mixture of elements and ideas from ""Divergent"", ""Starship Troopers"" and even ""Full Metal Jacket"" and the finale and final scenes are very similar to ""Tomorrow When the War Began"". I don't know if the filmmakers realized all that but it just seems like they got too much inspiration from too many sources, and in the end it doesn't work very well. A big problem for me is also that the movie does not have a proper ending. Pretty much all is left open and we have to wait for a sequel (if one ever materializes) to know how the story continues.What surprised me is that I didn't find Maika Monroe very convincing in her role as Ringer. I appreciated her recent performances in ""The Guest"" and ""It Follows"" but didn't fully buy her tough act here. It seemed too forced.All that aside, the strongest argument in favor of the movie is obviously its lead actress. Chloë just nails her role. She really does. She plays Cassie perfectly as this normal teenager who simply has to survive and learn how to handle guns and defend herself. Chloë is definitely no Hit-Girl here. It is kind of refreshing to see a young adult dystopian movie that features a heroine who has no special powers, is not a chosen one or such but just a normal girl trying to survive.One of the most memorable scenes apart from the opening is the one in which Cassie gets shot in the leg on a deserted highway and then hides from the shooter under a car. You can see a close-up of her pain-contorted face and you really feel for her. Chloë makes it seem so real. You actually believe that she is in pain. That is simply excellent acting. There are also some really stunning scenes in Evan's house when the wounded Cassie tries to get out of bed and falls to the floor, re-opening her leg wound in the process. It all seems very realistic and I cannot stress enough how good Chloë's acting is here.",The 5th Wave

While watching this film, I began to notice obvious similarities to other movies. While the film progressed, I realized that the film was just shamelessly ripping off other films in the 'YA' genre. Not to mention that this over-dramatic film is filled with exhausted stereotypes, idiotic plot lines, and foolish characters. The special effects were decent and the acting was sub-par, but the plot was unbearable for me. The script seemed like it was written by a group of 50-year-olds trying to connect with today's youth (which is actually true, all of the writers of this screenplay are over 50). Of course, the ending of this movie leans towards the possibility of a sequel. The novel has 2 sequels, and I honestly hope those won't be adapted.

They just had a narrator (which is the main character) tell us some events.On the good side, the first half part of the movie isn't slow. In fact it tells the first half of the book pretty quickly.It is bad that you may think of it is just a story about a girl meeting two hot guys while surviving the Others. (Not the Nicole Kidman movie.)It has every single movie cliche possible. People escaping in just the right time, infinite bullets and of course, not one but two hot guys for the girl.It would have a higher score for the ending scenes if it's an original story but no, it's not.

I don't even want to touch on the romance. Its just plain cheesy for kids. So when we see the alien spacecraft hovering i can't believe the US government got their power back and did not try fire missiles at it or try to shoot it down? They just leave that alien spacecraft hovering till the end, i did not even see anyone try to shoot at it.

First is to create a post-apocalyptic vision of future, be it the rise of science and technology or the collapse of human civilization, just as long as it is grounded on an issue that we are experiencing today: pollution, politics, poverty, privacy, etc. Second, set a new and questionable set of standards that taints our old values. Third, have the youth as protagonists that will fight to bring back these values, and fourth, build a romance subplot so it will appeal to a younger, target audience. These are the set of rules The 5th Wave faithfully abided to all through-out the movie.The protagonist of the film, Cassie Sullivan (played by Chloë Grace Moretz), is your typical high school girl—she studies hard, parties occasionally, has a best friend and a crush, etc. Until ""the last normal day of her life"" comes with a giant spaceship or more accurate prop leftover from Independence Day suddenly materializes in the sky, unleashing havoc on earth and decimating its population in waves (yes, this is where the movie borrows its title).The first three waves are narrated to us in a flashback. ""The 1st Wave"" is an electromagnetic pulse that knocks out all power sources and sends the entire planet back to the Stone Age. ""The 2nd Wave"" comes in the form of geological disturbances, including skyscraper- high tsunamis. With ""The 3rd Wave"", a mutated avian flu wipes out those who survived the first two waves. This brings us to the present, with ""The 4th Wave"" believed to be an alien invasion in the form of inhabited human hosts called ""The Others"".

And a month after watching it, i can say, in my opinion this isn't a good movie, but far away from being a bad one. The first 3 minutes are super intense and incredible well made. In 3 minutes you got an idea of the atmosphere, the situation the main character is in and what's going on on earth, without a word of exposition, awesome. The following 50 minutes are not as great as the opening, but still well made. Not great, but good actors, good introduction (even if it is not that spectacular), and a nice idea in general. The last 40 minutes or so, are what makes the movie a 3/5. It felt fast, unexpected (in a negative way, like Evan shows up at the military base like: ""Here I am just to make the Plot working!"") but also expected (in negative way as well, like you still kind of know that Evan is going to show up at the military base). And the camera work sometimes felt random (weird slow motion). And the ending was weird, but I think it was cool. The message is that you should always keep hoping, and with the open end, they challenge you to hope. In conclusion, I just want to share my opinion. I think it was better than everyone is saying. Great first 3 minutes, great message, great ending, good following 50 minutes, good acting, good atmosphere. OK in the middle.

145,trepessa,"Science fiction, aliens, invasion",8,14 May 2016,I have never read the book this movie is adapted from or even heard of it but movies will never be exactly like the books. It is an entirely different medium and things are changed for expediency and sometimes flow of the story.I have seen more than a hundred science fiction movies and my favorites deal with alien invasions or outer space. Independence Day isn't the first movie to have alien ships come to Earth and hover and won't be the last. It's not relevant. This is also not a Dystopian movie. Dystopian is what is left after a culture is totally ravaged but in this movie they are fighting. This movie is highly under rated and I guess it is because people are so jaded about science fiction movies and many are too young to have seen many other than in the last decade or so. I pay little heed to the critics. They are always hard to a fault on science fiction movies.This is a very good movie. It makes sense and it isn't a copy of any other movie I have ever seen other than there are aliens and they have invaded the Earth. How many ways can that be shown? It actually is very clever in a number of ways. Just because some of the actors are young doesn't make the movie necessarily young adult. I'm a senior and really liked it. There were many adults in the movie too. All the actors did a fine job and I thought it was excellent. I am not going to rehash the movie because that has already been done. I hope they do indeed make another film. This movie had a relatively low budget but it made three times as much as they spent. People need to quit being negative because it was better than the last Star Wars movie which was all right but no better than this movie.

It's impossible to go through most scenes without face-palming or starting to laugh at how ridiculous everything is, from the over the top military figure to the army of the children, going through the must have formulaic high school romance and the adorable plot ""twist"", which is much better suited for an elementary school play.

The whole idea behind it is totally unoriginal and boring to say the least. I was bored after first 5 minutes of the movie. The teenage drama cow dung. The brat of a brother with his teddy bear for example was one of the more irritating scenes. The forecast for a developing teen love triangle, which is just WTF in such movies and situations. Complete down right mentally challenged ways of people handling this invasion. The huge second or first wave, where natural disaster are destroying coastal cities and all we see are few tiny scenes of it. Huge missed opportunity to show the devastation. The script is boring, it can put you to sleep. - The characters are boring, you want them to die - The story premise is another alien invasion recycled drivel. - The pace of the movie is boring - The flashbacks and plot holes are annoyingAvoid at any cost if you value good Sci Fi movies, because this is not one of them. It falls under the category as ""War of The Worlds"", which was another movie with amazing main characters actions stupidity, boring script and a whole annoying storyline.",The 5th Wave
148,klheintz,Just another post apocalyptic teen flick,3,7 November 2016,"The 5th Wave is based on the book of the same name and it's main focus is on a girl reconnecting with her brother. It's a tried and true story for the post-apocalyptic genre and doesn't do anything really cool with it except for the title. The title of the film plays into the ""twist"" in the film, if you can even call it that and it's about the only thing that it does a little differently.Nothing too bad on the acting side. There's no Oscar winning performances but everybody does a decent job with the crap dialogue they are given. Except the kid... He just stares all the time, looking dumbfounded. Must have been a way to keep people from calling him ""The annoying kid."" The film looks good in it's presentation. The choreography in the fight scenes is a bit exaggerated but I enjoyed that. What is does so wrong is the absolute straight 'teen angst novel' scenes and relationships. The books suffered from this too and I feel it could have been made to be a bit more serious to kind of adult up the series and make it fit with a wider audience.Overall it is a bad adaption of an average book. It alienates everyone over the age of 12 by making it way too much like the novel and not trying to change up some of the things it needed to.",The 5th Wave

Definitely different than I'm used to with the Sci-Fi theme, it was still very thrilling to watch. Chloe Grace Moretz did a wonderful job as the lead character, Cassie Sullivan. For such a young actress and character, she was able to accomplish such mature emotions and struggles. The special effects were also fantastic! It's really so impressive the things the special and visual effects departments are able to accomplish. The director, J Blakeson, did a great job turning the book into a big screen hit. He was able to capture so many different aspects of a huge production and convey it very well for the audience. The story was well told with characters you could really connect with despite their extraterrestrial situation.

152,vvp_14,"Confusing, boring and without any sense",2,17 February 2017,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie after watching trailers. It turned out to be cheap-looking, confusing and boring with teenage cast and a couple of well-known good actors (Ron Livingston and Liev Schreiber) that didn't save it from the bad story and script. The dialogues sound terrible and most are completely not believable. It's a good example of a bad film that is bad starting with the story.The main idea of a school girl saving the world from aliens, after she grabs a rifle and all of a sudden becomes a worrier without anything given how she becomes one, is beyond anything sensible. There are lots of confusing and illogical goings-on in the story. When the fifth wave comes (the alien takeover), they take full control of the territory and are now hunting the last remaining humans one by one with alien craft hovering in the air. And yet, the aliens occupy a huge military base full of helicopters and land vehicles they use disguising themselves as human soldiers. Whatever for?! People that are hiding in the woods believe these aliens are human soldiers when they come, and that's in a situation when every single human being out in the open is in danger. How can a whole military base full of human soldiers exist and these poor people not even suspecting anything? What's more is these aliens-disguised-as-soldiers take little kids to the base and train them to become soldiers to kill humans, making the kids think humans are aliens. Kids?! They must be kidding. There is also a dull love story they threw in of this hero girl and some guy living in the woods who saves her from the aliens and then turns out to be an alien himself, but so sympathetic to humans that he decides to help her in her fight against the aliens. These things are just illogical and confusing.Don't expect to see anything that looks like an alien or great special effects or anything spectacular - the only CGI you will see in this movie is of an alien ship hanging in the air. All in all, it's probably the worst alien invasion movie I've seen since some cheap and silly 50s and 60s stuff. I could hardly wait for it to end. Not recommended.",The 5th Wave

It features a lot of children -> fair enough.But almost all action being completely predictable, the most important and featured moments is a Twilight-style teen love story, terrible inconsistencies every single minute, child soldiers in post-apocalyptic US, full make up when there is no electricity or running water - and similar things spoiling one's experience movie most of the time makes this one a below-average experience even on Netflix.And yes, from the 5 waves the 3rd doesn't exist.

156,zadok-332-444684,Mildly entertaining run off the mill Alien Invasion,5,23 March 2016,"First off I didn't regret watching it. I'd say a six is a pretty decent film and might even be recommendable if you are just looking for yet another film of that genre. This one is almost like that but has too many minor flaws to have that six. E.g. Cassie suddenly knows things we didn't see her finding out. Many supposedly dramatic events are predictable to the point of losing all impact. It is overall way too bland and cheesy. The effects are perfectly fine but not a major plus either. The background story is actually pretty good, although not that innovative and basically the umpteenth uptake on Wells' War of the Worlds. Mind about every Alien Invasion film is an uptake on War of the Worlds for good reason and this one did well in that regard. Better than Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" background story wise but that admittedly doesn't mean too much. Wells' 1938 radio transmission supposedly fooled over a million people into believing in an ongoing alien invasion, reported live. While no film could possibly achieve that nowadays a mild shudder may have been possible and refreshing.Supposedly The 5th Wave is a rather faithful adaptation of the book. Once we read a book we bring our own well developed imaginations and fill out blanks by drawing on the book. The events may no longer need to be explained as much. We forgive almost any small flaw as long as the images do not contradict our own. This film is probably good at that. It may also be its greatest flaw. Books take their time. Films do not. The choice to keep almost everything in the film leaves little room to develop and prepare the many events. It may be the very reason why it appears as bland and cheesy to a non-reader, who does not bring a more complete background. Consequently a reader may appreciate the film much more than I do.All in all probably not the worst choice if you are decided on watching TV tonight yet not really worth looking after.",The 5th Wave

This (at first) was a new take on alien invasion movies, and I have to admit I got fooled. Nothing was fresh. Everything re-hashed, and patched together like a bad last minute Thanksgiving dinner. So bad it wasn't worth staying for. Even worse... this film is predictable. Like a bowl of cold lumpy oatmeal. It's going to be unpleasant, and you already know how it's going to end up. Not sure why, but I have serious reservations about the Earth being saved by anyone in High School. The effects in this film are tired, as was the acting. The situations were even more ridiculous.

160,SaritaLW,Familiar Tune,6,21 January 2016,"Like any other novel based movie involving the avid use of young adult violence and triumph, The 5th Wave has a very familiar setting. Nowadays I guess screenwriters are having a hard time coming up with original stuff to continue to turn novels into feature films. But I will give it to Sony for finally joining Lions Gate Films (Hunger Games) and Paramount (Twilight) for deciding to take this journey of sequels. I was pleasantly surprised how simple and cliché this movie was made. The whole time I was watching, the audience and I pretty much knew what was going to happen the whole time and yet still, I could not stop watching it or awing and gawking at the two hunks (Evan and Ben) who reminded me very much of Jacob and Edward from The Twilight Saga Film series.The lack of action in this movie is what made me rate the way that I did. Going into this movie you expect to see the 5 waves in full action, but instead they limit what they want you to see making it almost a downer. Instead this movie focuses mostly on Cassie and her long mile hike to this army base to rescue her brother from aliens, all the while running into different obstacles which eventually shape her into this strong, surviving, attractive young girl.Will I continue to watch this trilogy? Of course, in hopes of a little more action. But even with Hunger Games there was minimal action up until the end.

The funniest part of it is that they were expecting to achieve a trilogy from it, although not putting the slightest effort in the initial movie. If you want to waste your time and money, maybe you should give it a try, but better don't. I was not pleasantly surprised to see an actor as Liev Schreiber to participate in such a bad movie. Of course he is acting up to his level, but with bad lines and a script he could only do as much. The only reason I am rating this movie with 1, is because I cannot give it a 0.",The 5th Wave

I am surprised by some of the other reviewers who apparently went with the expectation of not liking it. If you saw the trailer and it looked good you should go see it. In this case the aliens show up and destroy the earth's civilization without much effort. Some alien invasion movie have them show up just a generation or two ahead and the humans are able to make a fight of it. In this case there is no fight. It winds up with a few human survivors scattered around and since the aliens can appear like humans it has a Walking-Dead type feel where you can't trust anyone.Chloe Moretz was great in the main role. The only problem with that was that she pretty well out-shown the two leading men. In their defense one of them was so devastated by the deaths he went by the name ""zombie"".Aside from that the whole apocalypse scenario was well done and there were a couple of twists and you could pretty much see coming but they were still well done.

Mazerunner (the first) managed to have teenagers and make a good movie out of it, even with its flaws, the 5th waves did it the other way around, they had a good movie's ideas, and turned it into a 18- movie.and for the love of god for the second movie stop it with the cliché, the inconsistencies like that girl pretending to be a bad ass and yet always wearing that black make up and tidy hairdo etc, it reminds me more of a Japanese anime than a real movie...anyway I don't need to say anymore, if you liked the mentioned titles you'll probably enjoy this movie, but if you like movies such as district 9, the happening, 28 days later, the road and so on.. well go watch those again you won't be disappointed at least",The 5th Wave

And I have to say that overall I quite enjoyed watching this.I wouldn't call it a great movie, but it's far from being unwatchable too. Like what the title suggests, it is a rather lighthearted apocalyptic film, which is rare because such films are usually rather dark and violent. This, I guess, is the reason why it has received so many 1 star. It's not the usual end of the world kind of movies apocalyptic fans are used to. It's too youngish and lighthearted.***SPOILER ALERT***The good thing about this movie? It tied up all the loose ends and gave me the answers I needed. Throughout the movie I had been hoping that they would explain why they killed off all the adults and recruited child soldiers to fight the aliens instead. It was just plain silly. But praise the lord, the answer was given when they realized that they were in fact the 5th wave themselves and that they were manipulated by the aliens. If they didn't I would have rated this movie 3 or 4 stars. The ending seemed a bit rushed. So... Mr Walker just decided that he's now a human and started planting bombs, which god knows where he got from, around the whole facility? And where the hell did Ben's friends come from? How did they know where to pick him up if they haven't been in contact? And the part where Ben and Cassie casually removed Sam from right in front of everyone. BUT, these minor faults are within what I could stomach so they don't bother me as much they do for some people. I'm happy as long as they get the main plot right.The plot and acting were very average. All the youngsters in the movie seemed far too casual and relaxed, but for god sake cut them some slack there, some of them are like what, 10 years old?

So, first they shut down all power by sending EMP disabling ""power"" on the Earth (that would damage all turned on devices, but all turned off devices would be just fine, wouldn't they?). Then they arrange huge floods around the world, set up birds against us with avian flu, and do some earthquaky things.If they are capable of doing that kind of stuff remotely, wouldn't it be much easier to deploy some poisonous chemical into our atmosphere that would kill all humans (and animals if they don't need them) and then if necessary, deploy another chemical that would neutralise the poisonous one?But wait! There is more, to get rid of the rest of the humans, the aliens brain-wash human children and trick them to think that they are hunting and killing aliens when they are killing humans =palm-face=. Moreover, besides of occasional space-patrol ships, there is no alien technology whatsoever... They use human weapons, human military vehicles, human communication devices, which makes absolutely no sense.I'm not going to go into a teen-romance-drama things, if the main plot was good, I wouldn't mind it too much, but it is there as well, teenage boys washing in the lake, teenage accidently peeping on them, old to-boy-friend, new want-to-be-boy-friend, all this kind of nonsense.Verdict: Not Recommended.",The 5th Wave
169,bgajunkie,Chloe Grace Moretz does a spirited portrayal in a YA sci-fi dystopian drama flick,6,11 May 2020,"Chloe Grace Moretz does a spirited portrayal of a teenage girl forced to fend for herself and fight for her life in a post-apocalyptic world decimated by succeeding worldwide catastrophes and destruction. Defending herself from alien brutality and human betrayal. Romance develops in the midst of tragedy, all the while trying to find her missing brother. As a YA sci-fi drama flick, it is decent enough. As a full scale sci-fi dystopian drama acted by a young cast, it doesn't really stand up to scrutiny or depth of analysis. The film story doesn't faithfully follow that of the original book, but that is probably a good thing as the book wouldn't transfer to the screen visually due to internal character dialogue. If you lower your expectations based on past teen sci-fi dramas, then you can watch this with a measure of suspension of belief.
I originally rated this film a good 8/10, based on Chloe Grace Moretz carrying the film, as I like her spiky teenage kiss-ass (pun intended) girl characters. Looking back now I have revised my rating after taking a more critical and analytical view of it. In part, due to the overwhelmingly low, negative ratings and reviews for this movie.

The rest of the movie was collectively my least favourite bit.A giant prop leftover from Independence Day circles the earth or at least the Ohio bit of it and after a little while visits all manner of miseries on the hapless Ohians and maybe on other folk as well in what, really, is a pretty poorly planned and executed invasion.

176,joe6629,For the Twilight crowd - not for Sci-Fi fans,1,21 March 2016,"The ""Twilight"" crowd will love it. Awash in pretty boys, long soulful stares, teen-sexual tension, and a girl who manages to have pretty amazing hair, makeup, and stylish costuming even though there's been no running water or power for months, and she's been sleeping in the woods for ... days? weeks? equipped with only a teddy bear and a bottle of water (not that this is different from any Hollywood movie out there about the ""end of the world"") ""The 5th Wave"" can pretty much be watched with the Fast-Forward button pushed for well over half of the movie - especially if you're looking for any action and want to avoid the sappy ""romantic"" scenes. If you are looking for gritty, somewhat realistic, fast-paced, compelling science fiction ... this is NOT the movie for you.The acting across the board is flat - but it's not the actors' fault, really - they didn't have much of a script to work with. The writer failed to build any tension *anywhere* in the story. I spent most of the movie waiting for the pacing to pick up - but it never did. Overall, the movie is slow, non-sensical, and frankly, boring.There was a lot of potential here, but the makers failed to take advantage of any of that potential - which is too bad - and the way the movie ends makes it abundantly clear that they plan to do a sequel as you feel like you've just watched an episode of a TV-series - the ending just leaves you hanging - no resolution at all. If you want a more enjoyable ""alien invasion"" viewing experience, you might want to watch a few episodes of ""Falling Skies"" and save yourself a few bucks.",The 5th Wave

I respect the big screen and my hat is off to those who are perfecting their craft as artists on the silver screen. Having said that, I have watch a host of various genre films, and the ones that I truly love and deem classic, are downloaded and kept in my movie library for entertainment purposes when needed.

I mean seriously enough is enough already. Covergence, Divergent, the Host, Hunger Games, these end of day movies with surviving at all cost, embracing humanity is just over done and I'm done with them. This was just another teen survival flick with no purpose other than to give Chloe Moretz (whom I love) a lead role. She was great and did a good job in this told for the hundredth time story role. Honestly, this could've been a good sci-fi channel movie, without the cost of a movie ticket. I didn't enjoy it at all.

178,JabbaTheHans,Enjoyable action movie for teens,8,27 August 2018,"Just disregard the brutally low reviews of wannabe, frustrated film critics.Overall: I rate this 4 of 5. This film is a post-apocalyptic action movie meant for teens so put yourself in that mindset (a teen) to enjoy this. This film offers decent elements which I have broken down below. If you enjoy watching teens falling in love despite a really big world-altering event is happening in the background (e.g. Hunger Games, Maze Runner, Divergent), then you're going to probably enjoy this film.I have categorized significant noteworthy elements of the film below:Thrill: The protagonist will be running from and fighting off antagonists. The main protagonist (Chloë) is vulnerable and does not magically gain super powers to defeat enemies.Intrigue (plot twist): The major plot twist is nicely done and will makes the movie more interesting.Romance: Decent teen love story will be going on, with a set-up of a love triangle for a possible sequel.Acting: Chloë nails her acting in most scenes. Supporting cast also do good acting, except for the younger kids. Younger kids were seemingly chosen more because they were cute, rather than merit.Plot holes and unrealistic scenes: There are some unrealistic parts (yeah, even if it's sci-fi, it still has to be faithful to reality) like lighting camp fire in a forest filled with antagonists, making love while with an unhealed bullet wound in the inner thigh near genitals (that won't happen IRL), incompetent guards, passionate kissing when everyone should be running, teaching the wrong way of disarming an armed person... stuff like that.

It is filled with illogical decisions and the alien race, who is intelligent enough to come here and rule on landing, has no clue what to do and how to do anything efficiently.The so called waves are a fun given fact but make little sense. If if an alien race would go with that, I am sure they could come up with a more efficient 'wave' than to just infiltrate the human race. Their drones seem to be having no use at all, other than flying from point A to B. If an alien race has such technology and are in such dire need for living space, I don't think they will go with such a slow and pretty stupid method. They were already observing the earth for decades (if not longer) so I am sure wave 3 could have been a lot more efficient.Even setting all that aside, the movie is just one cliché event after another. It's one of those movies you go watch if you have really, really nothing else to do.",The 5th Wave
180,cesar_augusto,A shooting gallery of hit and miss,5,24 January 2016,"OK, first of all, the movie is very enjoyable, but one thing here and there can be a little distracting, but lets first talk about the pros: The pacing was great. Right in the beginning I could tell it was adapted from a novel, with a very carefully planned narration, pacing, Establishment and character development. Pretty much all characters were likable, the antagonists were very well shadowed and slowly exposed, and the movie did end with that taste of wanting more (specialy since it axed out a character I was glad to see by the back, but we will get to that now) The cons of the movie was actually just one: Evan Walker. Yup, you read it right, that ""half other"" schmuck is all I have in dislike of this movie. Not the actor, he did great (although he has the same tick of keeping his lips parted like Kristen Stewart, better work that out)but I felt his character was COMPLETELY unnecessary. Not only he turned Cassie from the though, solo protagonist weaving her path through apocalypse to save her only brother to a pathetic damsel in distress, but them both produced some out-of-place, ""finger in the throat"" googly-eyes love scenes. Complete with a half-naked shot of him to make teenagers swoon. From the moment he came up, the movie went downhill from Corny Av. and passing by Sappy Alley. I think the story would come up much better if it was just Cassie and Ben, venturing on opposite ends of the road to meet in the middle, I have to say it's my favorite cliché in stories like that, makes a great delivery when they meet, and this movie did manage it...and kinda ruined it with another sappy lovey-dovey moment of Cassie and Evan, thankfully, the last.And lets not mention the whole ""I was one of them, but my love at first sight for you (from a sniper's spyglass, how anti-climatic) made me decide to join your team"" I really couldn't hold myself from saying out loud ""really?"".If you want to make a though female protagonist go through a journey, don't decide to make her a damsel in distress in the middle of the story.

Almost everything in the 5th Wave is expandable and thus a sequel is definitely wanted and possible, as long as it doesn't drift too far from the books - like Allegiant - it'll definitely be big-screen-worthy.
Although I have to admit, the main characters aren't very skilled at acting. Cassie was fine, but Sam - given his age- was terrible at acting, which made the scenes with him rather cringey.
The ending was pretty anti-climatic, but the story itself was so thrilling that if something wrong happens in the end, I would really have a heart attack.",The 5th Wave
182,mlaimlai2,Another wave of YA fiction!,6,15 January 2016,"How many of these young adult fiction books are there? Over the past few years we've had a plethora of books made into movies like The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, Divergent and Twilight along with their sequels. As long as they make money at the box office, Hollywood shall continue to make them. Another adaptation in the long line of young adult fiction is The 5th Wave which starts off promisingly but then becomes another generic teenage film with a romance subplot and unconvincing action scenes.Cassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz) is just a normal teenage girl living happily in Ohio with her father (Ron Livingston), mother (Maggie Siff) and brother, Sam (Zackary Arthur). Their lives change when aliens invade Earth. The aliens inflict wave after wave of attack: the 1st wave refers to electromagnetic pulses being disabled resulting in a loss of communication and transportation; the 2nd wave is a flurry of natural disasters; the 3rd wave is an airborne deadly virus transmitted by birds; the 4th wave is the alien species inhabiting humans like parasites; the 5th wave is alien domination. The adults are separated from the children and the US army led by Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber) is taking control of the situation, placing children in quarantine so they can assist in fighting the alien species. Cassie finds herself isolated from her peers and must fight her own battles.The plot is tense and exciting but that's just for the first half an hour. Once the children have been separated from the adults, things become a bit stale. It doesn't help when there's sizable plot holes throughout the movie. The story then drifts off into a romantic subplot which was just as boring as the Twilight series. When the children are trained to fight the aliens, there's a sense that all excitement has dissipated. If the focus was on Cassie fighting her own battles and trying to find her brother then it would have made for a more exciting movie.The director is J Blakeson and this is his second directorial effort after The Disappearance of Alice Creed in 2009. It might be another seven years until he is employed again for he has some learning to do. Some of those close-up shots of the actors with their foreheads not in the frame were annoying and several of the fight scenes were difficult to see as they were filmed in natural lighting at night!Chloe Grace Moretz is developing into a terrific actress if she hasn't reached that level already. She is convincing as the teenager who must make her own decisions when her family is no longer around to support her. The two actors who play her love interests, Nick Robinson and Alex Roe, are both devilishly handsome but their roles could be played by any young, unknown Hollywood heartthrob. Liev Schreiber adds integrity to the production and can always be relied upon to hold the fort in the acting stakes.There are quite a few clever ideas in this film but the execution could have been much better. If you're a fan of young adult fiction, you won't be too disappointed but for people who have seen many movies, there's nothing new which will cause you to leap for joy. The story sticks pretty much to the generic formula and doesn't reach any great heights. http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review",The 5th Wave

I was pretty much engrossed and enjoying it. As the film went on it became a bit weaker with less interesting scenes apart from one or two. At the end I would say it was quite poor. I'm a fan of this type of film so admit I can be quite forgiving of this genre and I rate it a 7/10. It could have been 8 or 9 out of 10 if the story was better in the last third but sadly the end was poorly conceived. I enjoyed it but doubt I'll watch it again.

After reading the book the movie makes a lot more sense and I can appreciate it a little more, even after all the deviations and heavy filters. That said I don't think it's fair for directors/ producers/screenwriters to expect the masses to essentially ""do their homework"" before they can properly understand and enjoy a movie, that's just bad story telling.

Don't they have their own army?why do they use human facilities like planes when they have better things? where are authorities? where are other countries they considered America the only place on the planet? Even having 3 writers didn't help to make a good ending the end is open and unfinished? What happened to that alien commander? He just left earth peacefully? What happened to those children they took? The screenplay was so unprofessional. I couldn't see any sorrow or pain in peoples eyes. Come on they have lost their beloved ones why do they act relax? And about that Evan he just appeared from nowhere and fell in love with just a glance? It's not a romance or love story.How did Evan actually become a half-breed?

And i was right. I actually really enjoyed the first half of the film and although it had flaws, it wasn't sighing or rolling my eyes. It felt average but it went down hill at about the half way part.The first half was mostly introductory, we get to see two sides to the story, following the main girl and then her brother. It was somewhat predictable for me, but they did a good job trying to hide stuff.Pros: I enjoyed MOST of the acting, there were a few meh characters, but the main bad guy, played by Liev Schreiber, and the main protagonist, played by Chloe Moretz, were both outstanding in my opinion. Some side characters were good-average, while there were a couple that were just plain awful.Sure the story line was pretty basic and actually not that complicated, but i found it interesting that there isn't a more effective way of killing humans, but hey, what do i know.Despite some bad acting, the side characters were pretty interesting and i quite honestly would have rather seen a movie about the army squad of kids than the love drama play out with Chloe.Graphics were OK, they weren't bad, and there were some pretty cool shot, some bad ones too like the ending or the flood.Cons: There was a lack of action, some parts dragged on, with wwaaayyy too much drama or narration. And the actions scenes that did happen were way too short The forced love drama was just the worse. I understand this movie is directed to teenage girls, but it was painful to watch her relationship with the guy. The movie turned into having a strong female lead into another stupid divergent with a un needed love story that makes the female lead less strong and needing of saving more often from the hunk with abs (only real thing she knows about him, only thing that matters to her too *cough shallow cough* In the end...although i thought the movie started with promise, the movie falls flat with forced love drama that takes away from the film and is completely unneeded and takes about from the point of the movie, turning it into a fight for humanity for a fight for love.

By the way, the use of young soldiers is a good concept, because we are using this technique in all the world (I have no complaint about the plot in general, but about how was developed).I really want to give a better qualification, and that is because my reviews are more oriented about how enjoyable a movie is to watch, or to have a good time (if it makes you thinking, or leaves a good feeling), but sorry, this time I cant do that.",The 5th Wave

I have seen a few clips from this film on Youtube and thought it might be interesting, so, when I found it in a bargain bin yesterday, going for next to nothing, I paid the paltry few dollars and brought it home.I played it last night and reached the end of the miserable thing wishing that I had left it in the bin and used the paltry few dollars to buy something useful, like liquorice allsorts.

In light of later revelations, the apparently callous abandonment of their own casualties could be explained, but no military walks off leaving behind weapons than could later be used against them.Expecting a viewer to accept that small children could, in only a few weeks, be turned into combat soldiers, was pushing things a bit far, but it has apparently worked in parts of Africa, so why not the USA too? But then those same children were sent into battle at night, wearing lights on their helmets! Why not just give each a bullhorn so that she/he could stand out in the open and shout at the enemy, ""Here I am!

Powerful acting by cast but sadly there are a few lows within this film if they had made the story a bit more faster going and not waited until halfway in would have gotten an 8 maybe even a 9. Nothing much on the emotional side to get me highly into this film. Would I watch this again only if would friends and would I see sequel yes I would. If you are into anything like Diversion series then this is the perfect film for you and would highly recommend it. Not into those sort of films then maybe not.,The 5th Wave
205,mc_croucher,Doesn't Follow the Book,6,27 January 2016,"When I was reading the book, I was excited to watch the movie. (I literally finished the book in the theater while watching the previews.) I spent a lot of the time irritated with how much of the book got changed. However, if you haven't read the book and have come to just see the movie then I'd wait for it to come to Redbox. The movie, aside from not staying with the actual story, was quite predictable. Even though the characters were well developed, they lack a certain intrigue that makes you feel for the characters. While I pictured Ben Parish, Evan Walker, Sam, Teacup, and Ringer quite different from the actors who played them I did enjoy the characters themselves, if I separate what I know from the book at least. If you are looking for a movie without sexual content, this one is good. Aside from sexual comments and a kissing scene there isn't anything to worry about if you plan to watch with children. The violence isn't to much as well even though it is an action film with a sci-fi twist. The movie was quite similar to the movie The Host though. The alien twist and how the children are part of the fifth wave was my favorite part of the entire movie and the book.",The 5th Wave

The premise of the movie in itself wasn't bad, and the story as if unfolded wasn't that bad either, it was just that the execution of it that was terrible. I also didn't like the end, what happens next? how could they possibly go from where they are? Also what happened with her friend?

Unfortunately, it's all been done much better in other movies before.

210,Zeta-One,"Satisfying, but lacks creativity--",7,23 January 2016,"The apocalypse leading to the extinction of humanity is almost imminent as the invasive species known as ""The Others"" release five deadly waves onto the surviving humans of Earth. The 5th Wave is yet another young-adult film featuring a teenage survivalist as the protagonist and a world where manipulation and trust are issues set by the main antagonist.Joining a group of many beloved heroines, similar to the likes of Divergent Series and the Hunger Games, the 5th Wave features female protagonist, Cassie Sullivan (Chloë Grace Moretz), as a high-schooler who rapidly changes into a skilled combatant who struggles to stay alive and is lost between the sentiment within her and the events that unfold after the conclusion of the fourth wave.The film is much like countless of other young-adult films, clichéd and cringe-worthy, but has certain redeeming qualities that manage to make it at the very least enjoyable for entertainment purposes. The 5th Wave attempts to show the audience an alternative present-day reality, in a mediocre technique that renders the film slightly slow-paced and predictably dull. An addition made to the film was a pointless romance between Cassie and Evan Walker (Alex Roe), a man Cassie creates a brief alliance with so that her bullet wound could be cured. This devotion Evan develops towards Cassie is much too sudden, and leaves the audience in confusion as a result of its meaningless effect to the story as a whole.As the fifth wave begins and the US army begins to gets ready to ""take back the advantage"", Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber), an Other in the guise of the US army's leader of an attempt to get rid of the latter, manipulates the kids who have survived the as aforementioned waves to attack and kill off the rest of the human race. Amongst these kids include Cassie's brother, Sammy Sullivan (Zackary Arthur), who she is desperately trying to save from the clutches of the Others. During this attempt, Cassie leaves Evan and runs into her old crush, Ben Parish (Nick Robinson), and works together with him to retrieve her brother and evacuate the base before Evan detonates it and destroys it completely. After a thrilling, yet clichéd mission that involves the main protagonists, Vosch, and Sammy, Cassie eventually manages to escape the army base with Ben, and goes AWOL with the entirety of Squad 53.Despite being captivating in its own way, the 5th Wave fails to maintain originality and delivers many scenes that are very similar to those in the young-adult genre in general. Creating a reality where the audience eventually rules out that the protagonists would survive the chase anyway, the 5th Wave fails to make us sympathize with some of the characters and lacks creativity that could have made the film stand out more in the line of many countless others of the same plot and ideas as this one.The film does have its own merits that manages to help it redeem itself from disaster. One of these includes the enthralling acting by the actresses and the actors. Both Chloë Grace Moretz and Maika Monroe delivered an amazing performance and played their respective characters brilliantly, allowing the scenes to seem more believable and realistic. The male leads, Alex Roe and Nick Robinson also played their characters with such perfection that allowed the film to maintain a certain spell over the audience.Throughout the film, the pace was rather slow. However, it had a variety of scenes that managed to pick up the pace, creating tension and adding thrill to your viewing experience. To ease the tension, the film includes both humor and exhilaration and applies them to the right times and places in the scenes.All in all? The film is ultimately satisfying for the casual movie watcher and might spark interest into some of its viewers. The film is thrilling and manages to hold a certain charm from within- never losing the audience's attention from the beginning to the end. While it does has its own flaws and deficiencies, the film does redeems itself with remarkable acting and captivating scenes. The 5th Wave stands strong in its own way and is yet another sophisticated film on its way to join many in the YA film genre.",The 5th Wave

212,bigdmia,I didn't understand this film,1,18 May 2016,"It's supposed to be a teenage survival/fantasy/post-apocalyptic film, I get it. I never read the book versions of this film. I have not read other book versions of Twilight, Hunger Games, etc., either, but I understood those films.The difference with other films in it's genre is for instance; in The Hunger Games we can see the oppressed living in the Districts, and the Elite/Ruling Class living in the Capital - a clear distinction between the two. In Twilight we are able to see who the Vampires, Werewolves and the Humans are - a distinctive difference. In The Maze Runner we get to see the survivors, the maze, the creatures, the scorched environment and those in control... you get my point. The 5th Wave can be compared to M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"", a film where nothing actually happens. In the 5th Wave, you won't get to see the Aliens true form, no close up shot of the Alien Drones, which despite their technological advances - can not detect humans in the woods right under their flight path. Here is the huge plot-hole in this film. Why did the Aliens put the young survivors through all the rigorous training to militarise them, and implanting a rigged anti-cloaking chip to disguise fellow humans as aliens, a deception to trick the young soldiers to kill their fellow humans? The Aliens who were already and perfectly disguised as humans could simply assimilate within the rebellious human communities (as the earlier sleeper-Aliens did in other families and communities) and destroy them.",The 5th Wave
213,ruprupruphihihi,May aliens abduct this movie forever,2,27 March 2016,"5th Wave is a movie that is less cheerful than a funeral. If aliens watch this movie they would laugh to death. In the name of something new the story writers and the directors gather a story that has no solid base and is absolutely filled with loopholes. Aliens invade earth to kill all humans and occupy the earth. HOWEVER THEY DECIDE TO DO IT IN INSTALLMENTS FOR NO REASON. Their ultimate objective is to kill all humans but they kill them part by part with Tsunamis, disease etc. This really makes no sense at all. No background is shown about the resistant fighters whom aliens wants to kill with the child soldiers.. and the invading army of aliens who are so superior with technology like spaceship and creation of Tsunami and disease don,t even a have surveillance camera up on their base station. A clueless kid just walks into a military base, gets a boy, and gets out. The directors tried to create another teen fighting in strange world series like Divergence,Maze Runner and Mocking Jay. But instead they created a total waste of time with the worse Aliens in human movie history. Chloe ruined her career by choosing this movie and the director really needs a book called fundamentals of common sense.

215,PassengerB,On the verge of being good,5,22 April 2020,"I love Young Adult Dystopian movies and novels, and I love Chloe Moretz. So what's not to enjoy about this movie, I thought?The premise of aliens wiping out mankind in waves, decimating it one by one and using humans against each other was interesting enough. I can even get on board with the idea that since minors are more easily manipulated, the aliens targeted them to turn on each other without their knowledge. But the execution was really flawed in my view, as I'll explain below.First of all, this entire film moved ahead at such a brisk pace that it was difficult to follow what was what at times, and how quickly characters developed into full-fledged kill machines without much reservation. (It would take more than to dangle a necklace in front of my face to convince me to kill anyone at least.)
Also: Why did they have to give up their human names if it didn't matter that they were going to be used as cannon fodder, i.e. to help finish each other off? ""Zombie?"" ""Nugget?"" Really?!
Why would an advanced alien race train children and teenagers into being super soldiers, arm them, teach them how to survive, if it could be so easily discovered the kids were being duped?
Do the aliens like the idea of a challenge if they have to fight the army of minors they created? Come on.
I think this would have worked better as a mini series in which all the different threads and subplots could have been properly introduced, explained over time, and perhaps the romance bit slowly developed. This tidbit in particular felt extremely forced and rushed for the convenience of the target audience, teenage girls.The acting was mixed. Stellar performances by Liev Schreiber, Maria Bello and Chloe Grace Moretz. I had problems with the rest to be honest because I was under the impression that both adult as well as teen/kid actors regretted having to be part of this movie. At least their acting came across so uninspired and bored that this was the first thing to come to mind.So all in all it was enjoyable enough for the action parts, some of the more unique and never before heard ideas, but that wasn't enough to heave this movie over the edge of being considered ""good"" or even good enough for a rewatch unfortunately.
I hope this one might be remade in a few years' time, it certainly did ""Locke & Key"" no harm as Netflix taught us this year.",The 5th Wave
216,imabean,If Twilight were an end of the world alien invasion apocalypse flick...,3,1 May 2016,"The premise is devious and chilling. First, overtly attack from on high by taking out infrastructure with electromagnetic pulse and tectonic activity to induce widespread flooding, and then from within, insidiously subverting the innocence of the enemy's children and convincing them that the ""others"" must die.Too bad the execution is so terrible.High school and teen angst with undercurrents of young love and intimacy hobble the plot of what might otherwise be at least a B-movie style action film. I think this is the first daytime soap opera I've ever seen in movie form.Add to that the hopelessly boring aliens bent on conquering Earth. They're mimics, impersonating humans. They don't have much technology to speak of; they seem to use scanning equipment to make survivors of the invasion stand out as supposed enemies to the child army being risen to help the aliens vanquish all remaining resistance, but other than that they seem pretty ordinary. No tentacles, superhuman strength, exotic weaponry, even language is ordinary English so far as anyone reveals.Perhaps the only indication of the aliens' superiority to human beings is when Evan, revealed to be one of the alien ""sleeper"" agents (who mentions how ""different"" from the other kids he felt growing up... le sigh), manages a snap shot into the middle of a fellow alien's forehead with a sniper rifle from a good distance off while saving the female protagonist, Cassie, from certain death. Otherwise there's nothing to indicate that the aliens are anything remarkably inhuman.I'm reminded of the classic ""Red Dawn"" in this respect, where the enemy insinuates itself into humanity's neighorhoods but are quite human themselves.""It's our hope that makes us human,"" says Cassie, in closing, as we fade to black. I find myself so very glad this movie is over, and hope dearly that what bits I've read about this evolving into a TV series are as remote as the enjoyment of this drivel.",The 5th Wave

Not a single organic natural conversation. It felt like the wet dream of a preteen who didn't know what sex was yet.Truly alarmed at what studios have the audacity to put in theaters and demand money for. There was seriously nothing enjoyable about this movie. They didn't show any aliens or even really explore their motivations. Not even much CGI disaster scenes. Just a lot of bad young adult acting and running all over the place and bad editing.

Other than the way they presented it, the concept seems cool and varies slightly from other YA novels to movies that came out before. But then she loses her brother, ventures off into the woods and meets a guy. From that point on her storyline becomes a drawn-out typical teen dystopian romance and it's boring.Let's also talk about the main plot of the movie: that being the military training young people to take out the aliens (or as the movie calls them, the Others *groan*). The movie also uses the military leader as an exposition character, where basically his only role in the movie is to tell us what's going on and the progression of the aliens. Whatever, I didn't really have a problem with that storyline with the kids in the military, but the twist ending is honestly the dumbest thing ever. If everyone in the military has been taken over by the aliens, why would they be the ones to tell humans that they had the power to do so in the first place? The aliens could have secretly been killing off humans while no one knew that they where in fact aliens. But now that the humans are all aware that the aliens can take over their minds, they are now in the lookout for that. Also, since they are the military, why create an army of kids to kill off other humans (that the kids are led to believe are aliens, even though they're not) instead of kill humans themselves? In the scene where we are introduced to the army, they were successful in gathering everyone in one enclosed environment and surrounding them, so why didn't they keep using that tactic? Why only keep the kids, too? I guess they're easier to manipulate, but it's easier to physically train adults and kill them off once they've fulfilled their purpose.*sigh*I get that they were trying to have a cool twist, but if it ends up demolishing the rest of the movie that came before it, it really is not worth it. She reunites with her brother at the end, but right after the movie hints to a possible love triangle that could happen in the next movie (please don't let there be a sequel). Maybe the aliens are just really stupid, as demonstrated with the love interest that turns out to be an alien and doesn't kill her because he thinks she's pretty, as well as the whole military thing but if they're capable of all the damage they've done and mind control, I don't see how it makes any sense.Yeah, I'm analyzing a YA movie too much, but if we keep accepting stuff like this, they'll keep making them.

But I don't know if the directing was not up to par, or the script (actually both if you press me), but her performance here seemed less than her normal. Enough about the star.It felt like there were pieces missing, like the audience was left out of something. It was choppy.

Now there's nothing wrong with combining familiar elements into a new work but the finished product needs to have something to add to the conversation, a style all its own or a new way of looking at the subject matter. This just feels like a cynical, by-the-numbers exercise with nothing to say. In fact the whole thing is so clichéd that it rapidly becomes unintentionally hilarious. My 15 yr old son, surely well within the target demographic, lost it at the lake bathing scene and from there on in we sniggered through the rest of the movie. The 5th Wave only needs a tiny nudge to become a full-blown parody of the alien invasion, end-of-the- world sub-genre.The plot is predictable and you'll see every twist coming. Every character is a stereotype and none of them, excuse the pun, feel human. The handsome/beautiful leads are never less than immaculately presented regardless of the circumstances although Chloë Grace Moretz is sometimes artfully dishevelled while living in the woods. Apparently there is no shortage of mascara and eyeliner in the apocalypse. The special effects, though extremely limited, are acceptable but never impressive; there's no spectacle of destruction to enjoy here.

237,jpx400,"Generic YA sci-fi, but Moretz makes it watchable",5,2 February 2016,"In a time when sci-fi-oriented young adult stories of teenagers being forced to fight as soldiers are practically an annual tradition, we get The 5th Wave, a watchable movie that somehow stands out even less than any of the YA movies that came before it.Chloë Grace Moretz stars as Cassie Sullivan, a high school student, whose life is changed when a race of aliens known only as ""the Others"" invade the planet. After they cripple the population with a series of blackouts, earthquakes and a deadly disease, the first three waves, the survivors find out that the Others have become able to infect human hosts and seize control of them. When Cassie's brother is separated from her and taken to a military training facility to become a soldier in the war against the Others, Cassie finds herself on her own in the wilderness and goes on a journey by foot to find him.While Moretz's performance and decent action sequences make The 5th Wave watchable enough, it's not a remarkable movie. Far too much of the plot, including the first four waves described above, was given away by the very first trailer. The scenes of Cassie's life before the invasion are too painfully teen drama-like to mix with the story of an alien invasion. Much of the dialogue feels like it was written as a placeholder dialogue and never polished. And the storyline with the military never properly addresses the obvious ethical issues of sending teenagers into armed combat.To its credit, the film has some solid performances, mostly notably Moretz, who does a good job portraying someone in Cassie's situation. There are also enough decent action sequences and somewhat tense moments to keep you from losing interest, but only barely. Odds are your enjoyment of The 5th Wave is directly correlated to how much you like YA fiction in general.",The 5th Wave

Man, what a waste of time! The only thing that worth it was the presence of Liev Schreiber. It was not a great role, but after all one needs to pay the bills at home ;) The movie also reminded me the old 50's paranoia/xenophobia movies, in particular because the ""bad"" aliens were named as ""the others"".But the way the teenagers were depicted as just shallow and foolish ones would be quite offensive if I were one.And the worst to me was: using an army of kids and teenagers to destroy the remaining living world it just does not make sense at all!

So far not too bad. But as soon as our character risks the protection of her brother for his GD teddy bear, the movie fell apart. No vehicles work, yet when the ""army"" strolls in with their vehicles and buses, no one says ""hey, how the hell do your vehicles work?"", they just go ""yay, were saved!"" Turns out the ""army"" are the aliens kidnapping the teens to train them to kill their elders by wearing combat helmets that trick them into believing they can see aliens.Great. Here we go again with the whole ""teens killing others make things more dramatic"" plot. Anyways, main character eventually gets shot, saved by random guy (horrible acting), they travel for a week? on the road and end up sleeping with each other.... Wow...

243,Sgtonearm,The 5th Wave,5,3 August 2016,"The CLAW here, bringing you another, should you see it in theaters, or wait for the DVD. Here we go: Well, this is going to be a quick review, and not for the best of reasons. If you've seen the trailer, well, you've seen about 85% of the action in the movie. The first 30-40 minutes really grabbed my attention, with the set up of an alien invasion, something that I love as a Science fiction lover, and the introduction of a few intriguing characters unaware that their lives are about to change forever. Unfortunately, after that, is where it lost me.The last 2/3rds of the movie is essential a, yeah, saw that coming, no surprise there, and a love story. You could see the ""plot twists"" a mile away, which is a shame, because the idea behind this trilogy(this being movie 1, of probably 1) is really unique. However the execution in this movie was just all wrong in my opinion. The acting was OK, Chloe is a great actress and I really enjoyed her in Kick-Ass, and as the smart mouth on 30 Rock, but I think her acting suffered here from flat writing. Liev Schreiber plays a Army Colonel, and does a pretty decent job, but this type of character isn't anything ground breaking and doesn't add much. The CGI spaceships were pretty good, as were the natural disasters seen in the trailers, but nothing really over the top, not bad given a fairly small budget of only $40 million. Overall this movie doesn't really add anything new or interesting to the science fiction genre, and is just a rainy day watch, when its on TV. Especially since there most likely wont be a sequel.Recommendation: Wait for it on TV",The 5th Wave
244,nrppaul,This movie is freakin sick. Don't trust the haters. Spoilers.,9,13 February 2016,"The fifth wave. Oh man wouldn't amazing movie. I mean, this was really a movie that makes your re-examine the human perspective. From all its ups and downs and twists and turns I thought it was the plot was really strong and the casting and acting were just phenomenal, except at points it was so freaking sad... 😭. The first half the movie before we caught up with present day, was so sad with her mom and her dad and all her friends and everything she knew just... Gone. The first half was just awful to feel and don't get to attached cause it was really sad. But then when we caught up the present day and she met the people like as Evan it really picked up. But oh man, that guy with the crucifix 😭😭 😭. That was one of the worst parts 😭. Other than the sadness though, the whole the whole movie was great, like I thought the casting was really well done with the main actress who played Cassie like, oh man she was hot! Like she was a teenage boy's (myself included) dream! And the fact that the movie was adult but not too adult, I thought it was really age-appropriate for myself (16) if not a bit too old for my sister (13). But the plot twists, the incredible story line, just 😮!! The cinematics were ridiculously good, some of the best I've ever seen. Oh man, something really awesome was the kid army scenes especially the one with the city 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼. I loved it. I thought it was a really good movie and the characters were great. But yeah as a whole the movie really makes your re-examine your life and how much you have and it really makes you realize, what would you do if that was to happen to you? would you survive the first wave? The second wave? the third and the fourth? Or would it take all the way to the fifth wave and even after the fifth would you be Ben Parish and discover that everyone around you was a treasonous traitor? And even after that still keep fighting? Are you really that resilient? And Casey oh man Casey. Would you be able to traverse 80 miles of Ailen infested woods? with dangers around every turn? And be able to find your brother, the one part of hope, the one sentiment of your family that you have left, could you make it? I know I would try like Casey and I probably... No I could make it, could make it! Positive thinking! And then could you be like Evan? Could you be doing your duty and then give it all up for love at first sight? And even after that would you be able to woo that girl? the girl that you saved and make her think you're not a creep even though you are? Oh man i've seen a lot of movies and there aren't many that leave me feeling so satisfied yet sad at the same time. Like it was really good had a really good conclusion in the really good ending, but then when you look back and think about how they got there in the beginning and how sad it was that their mom their dad and everyone they knew... was killed. Not only that, it showed how they were killed and when and where, specifically. It showed their mom in her grave with mommy scrolled across it, oh man, I almost cried at that point it was so sad! An I considered myself a bit of a tough guy! Like it really makes you appreciate your family and love your family and try to change your life to make your time with your family better. Like recently I've been getting into a lot of arguments with my dad and stuff and this movie really makes me want to change and make him happier even if it is at the cost of myself because he should be happy and his happiness should make me happy. Any movie that can make me have these inner reflexions about myself and give me a real life message that I can apply my every day life, I think is a good movie. No matter what the critics say no matter how much they say it's sucked this movie was amazing and I think you all should watch it. It was truly remarkable, plus the lead actress is pretty darn hot so 😬😬😬 yeah.Also I don't think I've ever said about an actress, like ever.... I'm even talking about like Megan Fox and Emma Stone and stuff, like I'm pretty reserved guy but this actress she was perfect like mmhmm. That also could be because she's like exactly my age so *shrug*. In conclusion, great movie. Watch it. It was remarkable except be prepared for some extreme sadness at the beginning. Like it's so sad but I'm glad I watched it. It was so good in the ending and the conclusion is all great. Update: it's half an hour later and I'm still reeling. oh my gosh!",The 5th Wave

However, this is not your typical alien invasion movie. In fact we don't even see the real aliens in this movie. That's what the real complaints is all about from the sci-fi geek reviewers. Apart from the disasters, most of the action are humans fighting each other. It's not like TNT's TV series Falling Skies starring Noah Wyle, Independence Day movie starring Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum, and War of the Worlds starring Tom Cruise. We only see the aliens' mothership and its space fighters flying above ominously. The plot twist was highly predictable during a firefight scene.

None of the characters made me want to root for them. In fact, I disliked the entire cast. There is a fair amount of action in the movie, but probably not enough to justify watching the movie due to the action alone.

249,eymaslacker,The waves were the biggest problem,1,10 May 2016,"The first wave EMP's attack was dumb because all electronics NOT IN USE are not affected by an EMP. A computer/plane/whatever that was switched off during an EMP will work perfectly fine after the EMP passes. An EMP is a PULSE. It does not last for days. Then the various nations did nothing for days. OK maybe they are trying to communicate. Maybe they have already been taken over by aliens. Fine.Second wave, creating earthquakes and resulting tsunamis. This was a very stupid wave because the real damage will only happen to those areas with a coastline. You need to use an existing fault line to actually cause real damage because even a seismic event caused by a nuclear detonation underground does not last long enough. That means areas away from the fault lines and coastlines are perfectly safe from the tsunamis and earthquakesOK still no response. Everyone must have a bug in their brain. Fine.Third wave was the most logical and seriously they should have used it for wave 1 and 2 as well. Being immune to ONE disease doesn't make you immune to another disease. Just spam those high tech, improved diseases that the aliens are supposed to have.Wave 4 was just as dumb. You send aliens running around to shoot single or very small group targets. WHATEVER FOR? You have DRONES. YOU HAVE SPACECRAFT WHICH DO NOTHING, NOT EVEN SENSOR SWEEPS. You decide to hunt survivors one by one? What are those aliens? They came from a failed Predator movie?Wave 5 was just as stupid. You round up the kids. You train them to kill green targets. OK maybe the aliens thought the hoomans won't kill kids. That the kids won't run away (hahahaha). That the kids are worth something combat wise. The hoomans won't get their hands on free equipment after mowing down the kids. The hoomans will never use the helmets or every hooman is so stupid as to not figure out the plot after seeing the GREEN FACE WITH BUG.It would have been a lot simpler to simply tell the kids, ""hey kids, here's a bug that wants to latch onto your brain. You don't want it? Too bad, you're all unconscious or chained up"".

250,danishalishimajiri,Badly written and directed - Not worth watching,2,5 April 2016,"This movie could have been so much better and it just completely got flushed down the drain. Again as always IMDb rating cannot be relied on. To start this movie does have slightly interesting CGI scenes that is the only reason I rated this movie 2 stars, otherwise it would have been 1 (as there is not 0 star option). Story of the movie is lacks creativity, depth, originality and it just keeps on going and going just for the sake of movie concept and ends in a disappointing finish lacking any imagination what so ever. In this day an age where some TV series have amazing story, there is no room for having such badly directed and written movie. As for acting, I have seen some of the main actors in other movie and they did well, for example Chloë Grace Moretz did pretty well in kick ass, so doesn't make sense that her acting didn't have any emotion or character to it. It just felt hollow and lame, so I would blame the director for directing such a crap movie. Coming back to story again, it didn't even have a point or a decent conclusion or a concept. Just the typical SIFI genre, aliens come to earth (alien ship kind of like the one from movie District 9), brings down destruction of human race by a first very cliché EMP, followed by flood and plague like the story of MOSES then alien vs human troops which btw is so stupid because why would such an advance race that can cause flood and multiply crows overnight want to kill remaining humans in such a painstakingly slow way and inefficient way? TIPS for people who actually made the movie. Aliens who visit or can visit earth via space ship are expected to be very highly advance technologically and advanced in their evolutionary stage so why are they a parasitic alien who have to take over humans in order to move around. That doesn't sound like an advanced lifeform, even in the movie ALIEN the xenophobe didn't operate space ships even though they were smart but they only killed (which is more believable). A good movie is smart movie where the viewers believes your story, concept and how you portray it. This movie didn't even show how the aliens got inside the humans, how on earth did a high school girl become RAMBO all the sudden, why would such an advance alien race would want to use humans (childrens in this case) to kill remaining humans (its just stupid idea), hybrid alien who falls in love with a high school girl by just looking at her? Kinda insulting to us guy's coz we are not that desperate or pervs!OK I can go on forever pointing out lame things in this movie so I leave it to viewers imagination and to enjoy pointing out stupid things in the movie to enjoy it and kill time till the movie finishes.",The 5th Wave

But in the end, we were duped into one big, boring sloppily paced movie. The movie is based off of a novel written by author Rick Yancey. It follows the story of a young teenage girl who during an alien invasion gets separated from her little brother when the government executes martial law. The whole movie follows her journey as she tries to reunite with her younger brother. In the beginning, the movie starts off with some action and good special effects as the two try to find refuge through the torn land. But in the middle, that's where the movie starts to run out of steam. The story becomes flat and unexciting as the main character starts to narrate her journey all the while meeting a mysterious young man her age. The young man takes care of her and blah-bah-blah-bah-blah from there.

I was a fan of the amazing book before watching . I quickly found myself ensnared by Rick Yancey's ingenious work after page one. The film is a step down from just as good, which is still good, if not amazing.In The 5th Wave, we have Cassie Sullivan, our heroine protagonist, fight off the aliens invading our planet. One of the most original pieces in YA dystopia/post-apocalyptic is the idea of the Waves, the stages of the attacks. With the first wave, the world is thrown into darkness. Wave 2, the Others throw unimaginably large tsunamis and raging earthquakes at us. Wave 3. the Others genetically modify the Avian Flu and birds spread the new virus across the world. By Wave 4, the Others are among us, posing as our own. So you cannot trust anyone.This ""trust no one"" rule may not be all too original, but it sets the mood for the rest of the movie and provides our antagonist with a huge conflict as she meets Evan Walker on her quest to retrieve her brother from the Others. Cassie meets the unbearable choice of trusting him or not.Not only do we have Cassie, but you may find yourself liking Ben Parish, a jock-turned-badass-hardcore-soldier. His namesake will also crack you up to: Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Ringer, who we meet with Zombie at their refugee camp, is another character who will have you hooked by her mysterious façade, which is brought down in the second book of The 5th Wave series, The Infinite Sea.Overall, this movie is absolutely great and I often find myself dying to watch it again and pulling the book from my shelf and reading it again.",The 5th Wave

266,harmonyrose10,Stunning!,10,14 January 2016,"The 5th Wave is a new Sci-Fi Film directed by J Blakeson and is based on the novel of the same name by Rick Yancey. Cassie Sullivan (Chloë Grace Moretz,-Kick Ass) was a normal teenage girl before Earth was invaded by the others, destroying homes and family's. In desperation to find her younger brother, she teams up with a man who might be her final hope.I had been excited for this movie for maybe about a year. When the movie finally came out, I went in on the first day and first session, and boy was I not disappointed!Director J Blakeson did an amazing job with pretty much everything in this movie!Chloë Grace Moretz made a terrific performance playing the title role Cassie Sullivan. She got in so much depth with her character, she played the emotions perfectly, not under-exaggerated, not Over- Exaggerated, it was perfect! But so were all the other actors, including Alex Roe as Evan Walker, and Nick Robbinson as Ben Parish. Director J Blakeson did so well at keeping the story at a pace, the story never got boring and it never stretched out any of the scenes. I was always at the edge of my seat, especially with realistic special effects of the floods, the explosions, EVERYTHING!The story was filled with heaps of action and awesomeness! It is hard to find a movie these days with a great story-line, effects, dialogue and acting. But, this movie was fantastic and is worth the $15.00 you pay for the ticket. It did leave me with a few questions though, but it was overall, one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I would watch it again and buy it on Blu-Ray. So if you are looking for a good watch, go see The 5th Wave!",The 5th Wave
267,orlacordial,Same As Other YA Novels Turned Movies,6,16 December 2017,"There was nothing wrong with this movie, but there was also nothing really right. It had potential for a really good story line, however the execution was lacking in character development and there was nothing extraordinary about it to really grasp audiences, there was nothing that made audiences want to invest time and emotion to it. There has been so many YA novels turned movies in the past few years that any new ones need an extra edge to really make it stand out. I would like to see the second book turned into a film to see if they would be able to further develop the characters backstories and expand on the plot, add something a little extra to really draw the attention of the audience because there was nothing truly gripping about this movie. There doesn't seem to be any plans for the sequal but I hope there is a chance for them to continue this project and prove that it was just the first film that flopped.",The 5th Wave

But think about it - what civilization, earthbound or not, would survive living aggressively? They would exterminate each other sooner or later, unless they realize that the only way to live is to live cooperatively.One thing they got right - the US army is not your friend. I'm not talking about the people, they are fine, but the organization they work for, the machine of which they are cogs. It is the most destructive force in the whole history of homo sapiens. It does not serve the interests of the people but those of big business, to subjugate people and acquire more control over natural ""resources"" across the planet.Hollywood has a long history of promoting fear and violence, and this film is no exception.

274,cassmj,Definitely worth the viewing,8,23 January 2016,"First, this seems to be a movie where the critics went into the film expecting to hate it, and so that's the movie they saw. Critics far too often think only of themselves, and not how the rest of us may view a film.Second, seems like far too many viewers rely on critics to shape their own view, and so half the viewers hated it, too. This is unfortunate, as I recommend seeing this film. It remained true to the book, was well acted, and had a pacing that kept me engaged. I was unsure of how Moretz would do (didn't seem the Cassie type), but after a few minutes, she had me convinced. To those who say ""they've seen this all before,"" then I'm sure they think all sci-fi is exactly the same, all horror is the same, etc. There is humor, tension, and excitement that is well worth seeing.

Chloë Grace Moretz is fantastic in this movie just like she was in other movies i've seen her in.I wish it was filmed in a more adult way instead of the teen/young adult way.

The idea is not bad, of course we have already seen many alien invasion movies, but there is nothing wrong with pursuing the idea. The first part of the movie is kind of engaging because one is not completely sure of what is happening, there is some suspense, and the characters are likable. Then, soon, the plot jumps off the cliff. The aliens have the usual mother-ship floating above the city and the usual drones. They initially disrupt civilization with an electromagnetic pulse and then cause havoc with biological warfare, and then suddenly they become incapable of pushing through. Besides the lack of logic of this setting, I'm puzzled by the fact that the whole alien invasion seems to be happening somewhere in mid Ohio, with no consideration for what is happening in the rest of the world. The children are trained to fight humans, but not even a hint of who these humans are is given.

I always ragged on Jack & Jill to my friends in real life when talking about the worst movies ever made, but now, the king has been dethroned. At least with Jack & Jill, you EXPECT that movie to be the bottom of the barrel. This movie, despite it being a YA novel adaptation, should have had more effort put into it than it had, which felt like it had none at all. While sitting through this movie, I felt as if 200% of my brain melted from boredom. No, seriously. It felt like an eternity. Where to begin with this embarrassing excuse for a film? First off, this movie has the dumbest characters I've ever seen in any movie. The first 10 minutes alone proves my point. Second, this movie is WAY too long, and has no substance whatsoever. Thirdly, this movie has some of the worst, if not the worst, acting I've ever seen. All of CMG's pants for fear sounded like she was orgasm. Also, this movie gets the award for the absolute WORST child actor I've ever seen, in that of CGM's little brother. The ""no's"" he says at the 25-26 minute mark whenever he gets split up from his sister were so terribly acted and horribly done that I laughed. Even if you want to watch this movie to see how bad it is, keep in mind you have to drain 2 hours of your time on a movie that is a HUGE waste of time. I'm depressed thinking about all the things I could've been doing in the time that was drained from my soul watching this.

289,dcwarrior-84227,B Grade movie followed with B Grade directors & producers - Worth Watching if your bored,6,25 March 2016,"The movie 5th Wave was somewhat entertaining if you have nothing on your to do list. I was very unimpressed about how the director and producer FAILED massively to over look at the logic behind certain things and I'm sitting here trying to understand how this got passed the post production without identifying them. FACEPALM :|1. Where i started to loose interest, is that how did Cassie Sullivan (Chloë Grace Moretz) figure out how, what and who the aliens are and operate. It was like a matrix movie, all of a sudden she knew everything about the enemy when the movie never explained or showed how she knew about the aliens and who they were and how she came about figuring it out.2. How in the world did Chloë Grace Moretz get the leading role in this movie when she couldn't run properly. Most of her acting in this movie has her running throughout most of the movie and you notice how pathetic her running is when she runs beside other actors in the movie. To me it seemed she was merely jogging and the other actors at least felt like they were running to save their own skin.3. Here is the mother of all screw ups, you have 5yr olds to 18yr olds, that are supposed to be military trained soldiers, hmmm yeah right, the gear alone for a soldier to carry is roughly 20kg and the guns they were carrying would be roughly 1-2kg, so i can't see how any kid below 14yrs of age could even go into battle and fight with that amount of weight on them, let a lone move or run like it was portrayed in this movie.There is more i could go on but i'm limited to what i can say so ill stop here.In My Opinion; This movie would of been a box office smash hit if the producers & directors didn't overlook certain logical areas. This is a movie i would recommend to watch if you have nothing else to watch, but i wouldn't set special time aside to go out of my way to watch it. I feel if the movie had different directors & producers this would of been a great smash hit movie to make you want to watch 5th wave a couple of times over, it has a great storyboard just needed producers & directors with a keen eye for detail.",The 5th Wave

You know, the classic white boy who is fairly pumped up who always wants to keep the protagonist. I have no problem with a love situation in a sci-fi film, but if you're gonna put this on your film do it right.It just seems too forced to be there. First he is pretty pumped up. Second he is white. Third he is smart because in one scene when they are talking about the life before the waves he says ""You know, i once received a student grant"" and that seems so forced.

Basically messing up the book completely. Just like Divergent movies have but not as bad, and the Hunger game movies after the first movie just got worse... etc,etc. I don't know why I waste my time, really. If you want it all it's simple: Read the actual book rather than the messed-up copy of half-good actors and meaningless structure of a plot with no emotion or impact whatsoever.

The first half of the movie was fluent and made sense but I've never been one to like aliens taking over the human body. I would have liked it better if it had ""real"" aliens...something that you could tell was. They never explained how trucks and planes worked later on or how the aliens got into the body in the first place.

I went to see the movie a few days after it came out. With all of the negative reviews, I was worried that it was honestly as bad as everyone said it was. Chloe made a fabulous Cassie, she was even who I pictured as Cassie. There have been reviews about how she had eyeliner and painted nails. I think many people overlook the fact that she had a book bag filled with things that she probably wanted to have to make things seem normal, just like she packed her cellphone.They stayed true to the book besides the minor changes they decided to make.

The premise (not the alien invasion that is seen in the trailer, but everything surrounding the 5th wave, basically the crux of the movie) is so absolutely ludicrous that I said to myself ""this has to be based on some idiotic book by some hunger-games/divergent/twilight idiot of an author"". I was right of course. This would have never stood on its own right. It's absolute manure. The execution was just as bad. From minute details (such as a girl running around with an assault rifle waving it around as if it was made of plastic, soldiers that go on a covert operation at night with flashlights on their helmets which are never turned off even when they are chased by a superior force), through horrible CGI and down to abhorrent acting by, well, almost everyone, except for a solid performance by the colonel and a decent job by Chloe. The little brother was beyond reprimand. I literally cringed whenever he appeared on the screen, I mean my dog could have done a better job. When I had about 30 minutes of the movie left I just couldn't take it anymore. I put the playback rate at double speed and went as fast as I could through the rest of it. Rest assured, the movie only benefited from it, although the ending was, of course, utter garbage. In conclusion: Why oh why did I ignore the 5.2 rating on IMDb? Never again.",The 5th Wave

Thought my eyeballs would roll right out of my skull. Yes, it's for YA, but so was Harry Potter (wonderful), Maze Runner (no masterpiece) et al, and those weren't dripping saccharine. Even Eragon, written *by* a YA, wasn't. Hell, *my* YA couldn't take it. The pacing was very schizophrenic, lagging through hellish sappiness then rushing around the plot in what seemed an attempt to play catch-up, as though an inexperienced director suddenly realised he had wasted too much time or money and had to wrap things up. Oh, we have time again. Wait! No we don't! Wait! Yes we do! OmigodNoWeDon't!!!Speaking of directing, a few of these actors have experience at not being godawful on screen. What in Hades' silk-stitched knickers happened here? One actor acting badly is one thing, but all of them -- soulless, stilted, paper dolls -- smells like terrible directing. Or they were just really embarrassed to be reading their lines. Or both. Probably both.To be honest, there's not much to ""spoil,"" as you can see the plot twists coming a town away through dense fog, but anyhow..SPOILERS, I guess:Maybe the biggest issue were the many, many, *many* points of ridiculousness in the plot and the character silliness that just strained credulity so far they straight up ejected us from the experience. Right from the beginning: a 5yo outruns a rushing torrent of water by climbing a couple of metres up a tree? The whole town is flooded and wrecked, but their house is fine? The army is allowing all civilians to keep their weapons on a military base? And then training five small units of children as young as 5 to take on hordes of advanced aliens and none of the practically-adult kids question that, or wonder why the adults think that's kosher? Where is the goth chick getting all that eyeliner after the apocalypse? Alarms are going off in the compound, armed aliens are after you, you run into this random guy from high school who tells you exactly how to find exactly what you need to find (nevermind the implausibility of that) and rather than run off to go there, you all just stand there and have an inordinately long chat?? I could go on. My son exited the plane and announced to his dad he'd just seen the worst movie ever made.Summing up: cringeworthy, saptastic, dumpster fire. Rent, don't buy, if you must, and for the love of all that is good in this world, go in with low expectations. Or just do something more fun like bathe the cat. Better still, read the books instead. I hear they're exponentially better.An aside: No, we haven't read the books, and no, that should not be required to enjoy a film. Saying ""you have to read the book to enjoy the film,"" as some reviewers have, is like saying you have to read the recipe to enjoy a meal. If a movie is good, it can be enjoyed on it's own. If it's bad, it cannot. The onus of a poorly executed adaptation does not rest on the audience, but on its creators.

The aliens show up and surround the earth? Yeah, Independence Day, but without anyone being smart enough to mutter ""Checkmate"" and get outta Dodge during those 10 days while the crafts do nothing. Points for Cassie showing up to a near-empty classroom, tho. I know I wouldn't have gone to school at that point. Colonel Vosch and his alien troops drive into the refugee camp hiding in the woods . . . and no one wonders how THESE vehicles weren't fried when every vehicle planet- wide was fried by the aliens'/Others' EMP blast. No one accuses them of being aliens, merely gives them their children and goes into a room to hear instructions. Oh, and if ever do have a global pathogen, drink vinegar. And like every aliens-invade story, a miraculous ending occurs (literally miraculous because that's the only word for the Evan Walker character) that gets the protagonists out of the military base AND out of the aliens' clutches to set up for the (naturally) sequels.

327,game-seller,"""The 5th Wave"" is a good action film, but poor science-fiction",3,26 January 2016,"I have been a great fan of science-fiction for over 50 years. ""The Fifth Wave"" is an enjoyable picture. The acting was credible. The action scenes were well done, although not intense. The special effects were great. As a science-fiction film, however, the movie was nothing special.The biggest challenge of a science-fiction film is to offer original new ideas. This is something that is extremely rare in the film media. When originality is lacking, the goal becomes to present an old idea in a new way, or at least provide the ideas in a high quality presentation. Lastly, science-fiction is a vehicle for making a philosophical statement. ""The Fifth Wave"" does not provide any new ideas. Alien invasions are a topic that has been repeated for decades by various film-makers. The movie does succeed in creating a new approach to the alien invasion theme. Instead of aliens making a simple military attack upon the planet, or launching a plot of subterfuge, this film combines several forms of aggression into ""waves"" of attack. I applaud this innovation. As for the quality of the story, it falls far short of deserving accolades. It is obvious that the writers are attempting to throw plot twists at the audience, but they do so ineptly. Everything that occurs within the story is predictable. For example, the electro- magnetic pulses render all of mankind's vehicles inoperable. Suddenly, the army drives into camp with functional vehicles. It is obvious at that very moment that the army consists of aliens because humans would not have any operable vehicles. Every subsequent plot twist is equally predictable. The plot is not intelligent, and science-fiction stories are supposed to be intelligent tales that appeal to intelligent people. This movie was more of a mindless action story. Mindless action can be entertaining, but it does not generate good science-fiction. The last point of evaluation for a science-fiction film is in its effectiveness in making a philosophical statement. In this respect, ""The Fifth Wave"" does not seem to even try to make a statement, unless you think that ""kids will save the world"" is a profound statement. The movie is obviously intended to appeal to young audiences instead of intelligent audiences.In summary, ""The Fifth Wave"" is a good action adventure with good special effects. If that is all you want from a film, it is a very enjoyable movie. It is not, however, an intelligent science-fiction film. The plot is predictable and appeals more to young people than to thinking adults.",The 5th Wave

While it is expected to try and list this movie as just another dystopian young adult novel turned movie and while it has many of the same elements, I believe that it is different enough to give a fresh spin on the genre. The pacing was better than Divergent and flowed smoothly, with the exception of things like learning how to shoot a gun quickly, etc. I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 for the cheesy love story with cheesy lines. I could literally hear the audience cringe at certain lines. Despite this, I was engaged the whole time, which has not happened in a while when I go to the theater because a lot of movies have unanswered questions, have crappy pacing, etc.Some people mentioned that there were plot holes. To be honest, I was too engaged to notice them, so they can't be too big, but those people must keep in mind that the movie is an adaption of a book (which I have not read yet). Divergent was one of those movies that didn't make a whole lot of sense if you watched the movie before reading the book, but I gave it a second chance and ended up liking it. Overall, no movie is perfect, but this one was pretty good, and I would recommend it, especially if you love young adult novels.

A few came with me and they said it was one of the best adaptations from a book, which is a great step up as many book-movies are really unsuccessful. This film had me in tears and the acting from all the cast, especially Chloe, Alex Roe (Evan), Nick Robinson (Ben) and the actor that plays Sammy, the younger brother.

333,wilso-85641,OK i guess,3,24 January 2016,"I haven't seen ""Kick Ass"" but can easily understand why Choe's oversized facial features meant she was perfect as a cartoon-character superhero. Unfortunately, The 5th Wave is so derivative and B-grade (the military base set? the x-ray vision?) it almost, but doesn't quite, reach so-bad- its-good levels. Perhaps the budget was blown on the first 30 minutes which were impressive and entertaining enough, and the opening sequence certainly had a maturity that faded as the movie progressed and the cast, mirroring the plotting, became younger and younger. If the love- triangle of the Hunger Games (down-played in the movies compared to the books) was a rip-off from the Twilight Saga, this rip-off of a rip-off is hard to take without a large dose of cynicism. Much can be said of Stephanie Myer's writing but it is hard to doubt her sincerity. I don't think the movie makers intended The 5th Wave to be a post-modern (""meta"" in the words of Gale Weathers) take on the young adult genre, but maybe realised it was inevitable as filming progressed. At that stage though the filmmakers should have gone all-out and maybe then they could have salvaged something. Chloe is a class-act, but her character doesn't have the internal determination and grit of the leads from Divergent or Maze Runner which dragged me along happily in those YA adaptations. The scene where she kills a female soldier is one of the most unbelievable parts of the movie, and that's saying a lot. The strong ending and the psychedelic closing credits, bringing back memories of an early 2000s screen saver, to the wonderfully rousing ""Alive"" by Sia, almost, almost, raised my dopamine levels enough for me to care what happens next to the group of under-aged heroes.

It's also by belief that those between those ages might find this film to be another teen dystopian washout with an average female lead and common love interest. For those younger might see it as an apocalyptic thriller. They may see it as a story of intense loyalty, love, and strength. It may be perceived as a becoming of one's stronger, more powerful, less average more extraordinary self. For those older might see it as either a way to entertain their teenagers or a twisted way to look at the reality of our government or what our government is becoming. Some have compared this film to Twilight, Hunger Games, or Divergent. They do indeed carry similar elements. Similar to Twilight, Evan Walker (love interest) is not human but an intense romance begins before we find that out. He later decides to deny the nonhuman part to be with the girl. Similar to Divergent and Hunger Games their unlikely survival is due to their leader, Vosch, who is actually the bad guy.

The writing seemed rushed and lacked a clear storyline sticking to many cliché film story lines with the classic romance and predictable outcomes in scenes, from where the enemies were, to characters stumbling upon each other and saving each other at the last minute. I found I struggled to concentrate on the film as there was nothing to keep me particularly interested other than the poorly constructed fight scenes that could have been better choreographed if the budget hadn't been spent on explosions and CGI. There's only one real positive that can be taken from the film which was the cast are young and they have potential and by being in this level of a film this early on in their careers they could go onto bigger films.

Most of the chapters in the book are going on during the winter, in movie though there is no winter. Colonel Vosch was all wrong, soldiers were wrong, Sgt. Reznik was wrong and where is Dr. Pam and the rest of the book's characters? Where are the millions of dead bodies? Where is the scavenger boy swimming in human ashes for jewelry? They were always tired and dirty, unwashed for months, exactly as they ought to be in situation like alien invasion. Whole magic and terrifying plot was simplified to the bone marrow and most likely nobody of the whole directing team had no clue about the book's original plot. Absolute catastrophe. It may have been the movie to be remembered for generations to come but they have ruined it, all the way, top to bottom. Waste of time. Guys read the book, it is so great that you shall stop to eat, drink or walk and there will be no force to separate you from that awesome piece of Sci-Fi literature.

Cassie's younger brother, Sam, is taken to an US Army base, while Cassie makes a run in order to save her little brother. She eventually falls in love with Evan Walker, who commits that his family were killed by The Others (the aliens that are attacking Earth). In the end, Cassie saves her little brother and her high school friend Ben Parish as well, while Evan bombs the Army base, in order to kill the US Army leaders, which were actually ""The Others"". Later on, Cassie and Ben develop a plan to save the rest of the kids from who were sent onto the planes.I really like this film. It has a great plot, cute romance, but it should have a sequel. If someone goes and has a plan like this, where the movie obliviously ends with a cliffhanger, then that's where the sequel should start off at.

So far, this one and the Divergent series movies have been the main YA movies that truly get my attention.

366,LouiseCavel,First time writing a review ... I was THAT disappointed.,1,21 March 2016,"I've never written a review before, and am the kind of person who gives every movie a chance no matter how cheesy. THIS movie however, based off a great series by Rick Yancey, was SO terribly done I almost couldn't believe it.*SPOILERS AHEAD Where to start ... within the first 8 minutes of the movie they change the back story of two main characters by adding in a party scene - having Ben and Cassie meet before the end of the world. Instantly I was irritated because 1. Cassie is a bit of a loner, socially awkward teen who doesn't party. 2. By having Cassie and Ben meet before the end of the world, I don't think any movie has made a more obvious foreshadow of a potential future ""romance"". We get it Hollywood, love triangles really seem to take off with the younger generation (looking at you team Edward/Gale/Damon VS team Jacob/Peta/Stefan)BUT THATS NEVER BEEN THE CASE IN THESE BOOKS. There is no romance between Ben and Cassie, so stop trying to make it happen.The movie continues to spiral by making it the most complicated plot in the world to understand unless you've read the books. Waves 1-3 are easy enough to understand as they're zipped through with embarrassing CGI effects and zero emotional connection making me really not care at all about the billions that just died. Wave 4 is not explained properly in the slightest. I've read some reviews here with people complaining about the studio copping out financially by not having any actual aliens and only humans ""infected"" by aliens. Which I totally get, and which wouldn't be an issue if they explained that the ship in the sky was actually just a distraction and that ""sleeper aliens"" some 15 or so years earlier were implanted in baby fetus' and only when the ship appeared were they awakened. Wave 4 is about these sleeper aliens who awoke in the bodies they've been inhabiting for 15+ years and have 1 mission only - wipe out the remaining humans. Evan is one of these sleepers - a fact that was so badly explained I had to pause the movie and explain to my bf what the actual heck was really going on.Wave 5 was even worse off in the explanation department. Lets start off with where they first went wrong - when they were loading kids on the bus, in the book, Cassie isn't allowed on because its only for kids 12 and under. This is integral for the majority of the storyline because in the end, these children are easily brainwashed into thinking they are the last hope of survival and to help kill the ""aliens"". If they loaded me up on this bus when I was Cassie/Bens age I would have just a few questions about what was actually going on. Ben is only at the base camp because he almost dies from the 3rd Wave bird flu (which they also completely left out other then a 35 second explanation on how he got his nickname Zombie)but other then Ben, the majority of these kids are all super young. Instead of focusing and explaining this 5th wave, they decided to give us 45 minutes worth of teenage angst from both Cassie/Evan and Ben/Ringer.I could go on and on. Were the soldiers at the refugee camp bad guys or did they just shoot everyone because a riot that does not happen in the book breaks out? (fyi, in the books there is ZERO question that the soldiers are aliens. Its a quick round up of the remaining adults and execution style deaths, and then when Cassie is caught alive still they chase her down and attempt to kill her with an alien bomb.)Who is Evan and why does he just come off as a creepy 30 year old stalker? What actually was the 5th wave? And most importantly, WHO blow-dries Cassie's hair everyday so her curls look nicer then mine? These are all questions I had to answer for non-book readers. Except the last one, even I couldn't figure out how Cassie stayed so clean looking.Like I said, normally I don't review. If this was a stand alone movie I would have enjoyed its fluffy, silly nature. However, when you take a favorite book series and try your hardest to churn out another teenage love triangle romance absolutely ruining the entire plot while doing so ... ta-da you get my scathing remarks. BOOK FANS: Don't bother with this movie! To everyone else I suggest reading the first book! It's a great series and did not deserve to be represented by this mess.",The 5th Wave

I understand that it doesn't have the liberty of unlimited space like a book does, however there is no real attention paid to allowing the audience to know any of the characters. All the non-main characters (i.e. Sam and Ringer) have no personality, if you hear them speak, and seem to have no real reason behind their actions. Even the main characters like Cassie and Ben appear to not be able to think of themselves and pull conclusions out of nowhere, even without being prompted. Also, all of the clichés about teenage love are sickening and are really forced into the movie. The book had real potential for a movie as it was a great story, but this movie was rushed and terrible. I would have given it a 1 star, but some of the special effects are good.

377,emil-nylander,A dumb movie trying to be smart,3,15 February 2018,"I didn't come in to this movie with high hopes. However, for the first couple of 10-15 minutes I was drawn in by the opening narration of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd wave. Then the 4th wave is announced and everything goes down-hill.Not going in to the two largest plot holes I can't help but feel ruined this movie for me. This movie has special effects that looks like they are from 10 years ago, the acting is at the best sub-par and no real tension is built up to make us care for the characters.Now to the plot holes:1. The EMP.
The 1st wave was an EMP, strong enough to wipe out all electricity and render machines useless. This is all fine and when the military shows up everyone is struck by the fact that they have working cars. This is fine, perhaps they are old cars that don't have any electrical parts to speak off (for some far-fetched reason). However, then they end up at the military base where everything is lit up by electricity, and there's not a person that question this! You might say ""Hey, perhaps they had protected wireing, that wasn't hit by the EMP"". To that I say bullshit! Why didn't they military use electrical equipment way earlier during the 1st, 2nd or 3rd wave to greatly help out the population then?3. Child Soldiers
Why would you prefer to send in child soldiers to fight the infections if you have an army? The soldiers should have alot more training, and in any scenario the children should be protected to preserve the species. Yet there's not a soul that questions why children are sent in to fight instead of soldiers? It just oozes of corruption and at the scene where they find out what the neck trackers really do and they say ""they thought they could manipulate us because we're children"", you just wanna go ""Yes! But it's sort of deserved if you are not going to use your brains"".",The 5th Wave

It almost hurt my movie-loving heart when I saw the movie and all the potential it could have if only they had put more time and effort on the script, casting, storyboards, composition and meetings. The whole movie felt like an experiment in which it jumped between different types of cinematic framing and camera angles. Certain images were really good-looking but when they were followed by a new image it destroyed the whole feeling and it got me to believe believe that they had like put a whole day to do this ""nice"" picture and then realized that they only have a day left to do the rest out of the scene.Chloë Grace Moretz did a good job as a crying and screaming teenager who didn't know where her family were. The scene in the store where she meets another ""survivor"" is actually really good, and if they had kept the film on the track, I had given a much higher rating. But the film resulted in a romance between an adult alien and minor human which almost felt uncomfortable. But everything is permitted in love and war, I guess.Anyway this was predictable and a way to long movie, it was pretty alright to look at. But I feel that I have already seen the movie too many times (Once is good enough) to see it again.The fifth wave gets a five out of ten. Low but fair rating.",The 5th Wave
382,gryphongirl96,"More like ""The Cheese Wave""",2,13 May 2016,"Honestly... I expected a fun, intriguing, edge-of-your-sit sci-fi ride, but... i guess we could call it The 5th Twilight.There are too many cringe-worthy moments (toooo many, maybe The 5th Cringe fits perfectly). As it went on, i expected to see if Chloe Grace Moretz could save me from the disaster (mind the pun) but well... didn't happen.All jokes aside, first of all, the movie lacks character development from the very start. Everything happens too fast and you don't get to be interested in what might happen to them -SPOILER- (we in fact go through TWO ""relevant"" deaths that didn't make us blink an eye).- END OF SPOILER-2: The visuals and camera work are so ridiculously colorful and cheerful that take all the seriousness away from the scenes. Jeez, there were moments where you could have said you were watching ""Juno 2.0: The Apocalyptic Version"". 3: The acting. Unbelievable. It's like watching The Room, you know? You cringe and laugh all the time because it's just sooo bad it's good. (Except that you don't laugh with this one, 'cause it's unbelievably AWFUL. This kind of disappointed me 'cause i expected a whole lot more from Moretz, but well... i guess people still don't get that she's too much of a cutie face to play this kind of roles. Oh, and the rest of the cast didn't help, not one bit).4: The plot it's so disgustingly predictable that i actually feel insulted. Plus, the worst part was that you COULD tell that everything was going to get EVEN MORE cringe-worthy and just had to hold on to the very few hopes of it going into another direction.(SPOILERS AHEAD)5: Plot development. Jesus... OK, how come this teenage dork can spend days in the woods (during an ALIEN INVASION) and yet look surprisingly beautiful and unharmed? What about her clothes being in perfect shape? Don't make me start with her hair... What about all the dust and filth that flies around (that obviously doesn't even touch her face)? Worst of all, how can this midget barbie doll handle a MACHINE GUN ALL OF A SUDDEN!? AND SURVIVE!? Hmm... (Loading...)Also, when she in fact GETS shot, she gets rescued by probably the most beautiful man alive, 'cause... obviously, right? Right. And YES, she spies on him chopping wood... Oh, and taking a bath in the river while he touches himself and his hair (I swear, i was hoping this not to happen but it did). But no, they don't fall in lov--pff, duh, of course they do.Finally, when i had already thrown all my hopes away, she finds out he's one of the ""bad guys"" but then he tells her that he TRIED to kill her, but NOW believes in love because she has changed him... (scene that pretty much made me want to kill someone or something to get back the hour and a half that i'd wasted).Oh, and it also has a pretty big plot hole in the end which tells us that, unfortunately, we might have a sequel coming soon. Just... just no, please.(END OF SPOILERS)Anyway, i give it a 2 out of 10 due to some ""good"" visual scenes, and that's saying something. All i can say (after my loooong previous speech), is that you should only watch it if you want to spend some time with your little brother or sister, maybe some cousin...

It's in the level of being as big as The Hunger Games, Divergent, and the Twilight. I really thought that the movie was excellent and I hope the other 2 movies are made so we can all find out what happens next. Hopefully the next movies are done better than the first. The 5th Wave is similar to these other movie series but the only difference is that most of the characters are ordinary and all of a sudden there are aliens and the aliens are disguised as humans so any real humans will have to be aware if they are with real humans or the aliens which in the book/movie they are known as ""the others""",The 5th Wave

One positive point are the effects, were the destruction of all humans with the help of 5 waves of disasters is shown very good. Then the movie comes to a quick ending, where most conflicts are not solved. Therefor we have to wait for the second part of this movie.

The casts fit so well for each role and the relationships formed really help build up tension for the viewers.

The beginning of it tells about the first 4 waves (CGI guys and soundtrack really delivered here), and how Cassie survived through all of it, and consequently in the forest, really catching your attention. I haven't had so many goosebumps in a movie theater since 2014. Really excellent start.""WOW!

She falls in love with him, he talks some awful lines, etc etc etc. Note here dropped by half. It became horrible. 5/10. ""But why is your vote 7?""

394,DejmalSoptik,The perfect movie for critics to vent their frustration from other more popular YA.,10,12 February 2016,"I consider this movie an above average YA adaptation. Sure it's not perfect and has a few cringe-worthy moments, but they are few and far in between. It has talented young actors and good pacing that keeps you on your toes especially in the first half of the movie. So imagine my surprise when I looked at Rotten Tomatoes and found out it has only a measly 17 percent. I couldn't help it and read some of the reviews. I wondered what exactly were those esteemed critics complaining about. Let's see.No originality– true, but then again I have yet to see a Hollywood sci-fi YA that is original. Somehow this didn't bother them during Hunger Games or Divergent. Love triangle– except there isn't one. Ben and Cassie have one short scene in the beginning. She has a crush. How unusual for a teenage girl. And that's it. After this they only meet at the end of the movie and there is no romantic tension whatsoever. She's no longer interested in him, he was never interested in her. At the beginning we also see scenes of Cassie with her best friend, Cassie at school, Cassie with her family, Cassie playing soccer – so obviously that scene with Ben was there to simply show that she's a normal girl and to introduce Ben as a character.Similarity to Twilight, Evan as a stalker type – Yeah, for about 5 seconds in a flashback that really had to be there to show the moment he first saw her.With the exception of a few scenes, the movie only shows destruction in the US, even though the problem is worldwide– the movie budget was 38M. Enough said.The movie's cliché romantic scenesyes, but nowhere near Twilight level. Actually scenes between Peta and Gale talking about Katniss in Mockingjay 2 were way more cringe worthy than this. Also one might get the impression those scenes take the whole second half of the movie, while it's in fact about 15 minutes of screen time. Getting your gunshot wound stitched is not a romantic scene.The movie is like an AD for NRA (National Rifle Association)– because I guess it's a really bad idea to give your daughter a gun in a post-apocalyptic world where aliens invade the Earth.The all-white cast. Yes, I will open this can of worms. This movie dared to exclude the obligatory minor role the talented non-white actors usually get. On purpose? In the book, the first thing you'll read after the title is Hawking's quote about Columbus and Native Americans. So the casting choice could very well be a reference to that and western Europe's colonization of other countries centuries ago. To make people think that maybe screwing with other nations isn't the best idea just like H.G. Wells did in War of the Worlds. But let's hate this movie anyway, because ""I see white people.""So the most disappointing about this otherwise quite entertaining movie, as long as you like the genre, is the laziness of its reviewers. It looks like all the things the critics wanted to write about the YA franchise for a while were crammed into the reviews of the Fifth Wave. Therefore it gets a 10 to compensate for all the nonsense I read.",The 5th Wave

Perhaps my 7 is a bit high, I admit I'm a sucker for Sci-Fi and it has to be really bad for me to dislike it, and this is definitely not the best Sci-Fi movie I have seen by any account. Story, script and acting. Decent enough story - I believed it, it even had my sitting on the edge of my chair a few times. Nearing the end it gets clear the development is halted by what looks to me like some budget limitations, I think that is to expect from a movie with a budget in the lower end. Acting was above what could be expected, conversation was alright, felt pretty natural and not full of bad one liners (thank you scriptwriter) nothing super cheesy either. The story itself could have been more original, and I believe one of the plot twists could have been carried out more elegantly - if you decide to watch the movie (give it a try, really) - perhaps you can see what I mean. Production, CGI and more...Im not a pro to judge this by any means, so this is just my layman's perspective on things, overall production looked nice, I didn't notice any major flaws, or anything looking very very bad. CGI was not impressive, but it's clear from the beginning this is not a huge CGI movie, and they have to use other means to bring the story forward. This can be both good and bad, in the 5th wave they land a little bit in between, this drags the overall movie a bit down. Normally I'd give a movie like this 5 or 6 stars, but I give it 7, because although none of its elements are truly great, I think they pull through on all elements at the same time, in the end the acting pulls the overall score up a little bit.

What the director and the script of The 5th Wave have done to her are the sort of things that happen in actors' nightmares. This movie is so bad in so many ways. The director appears to have been let loose on this project after a few evening adult education classes in directing. The script was written, it seems mainly by kids brought up on bad shooter games and Hallmark romantic movies (not a good combo). And don't even get me started on the endless tired clichés they keep throwing at you whenever they don't know what lines to serve up (which sadly is much more frequent than you'd think). After one hour into the movie you realise they are still trying to explain the plot and set up the pieces. After that it gets even worse. Liv Schreiber must have agreed to act (albeit a very small part) in this before he read the script and knew who the director was. I hope this is the worst film I will watch this year so I can say I've paid my annual dues to the entertainment industry.",The 5th Wave
406,cheyannescott,Review on The 5th Wave,10,30 April 2016,"With the film The 5th Wave i love how the director has made it i think J Blakeson has done it, he has chosen the right character for each part and i am hoping there will be more to come. Cassie and Evan are pretty great i would like to see what happens and i am happy that she is still in the movie as she is one of my two favourite characters. I would like to see what happens with Cassie and Evan if he ever finds her after he blow up the place at the end. I want them together. I would also want to see what happens with Zombie and the girl. Cassie, Evan and Sammy need to become a family and try to settle down as a family. What happened to Evan when the explosion happened, did he make it out okay and hoping that he finds his way to he love Cassie. Everyone is safe for now i really want something interesting and exciting to happen in the next one if it did come to a movie.",The 5th Wave
407,sch-06805,Don't understand the low ratings...,7,7 May 2016,"Honestly almost didn't rent this because of all the bad reviews and comparisons to Twilight/teen movies. Was there a silly angsty teen romance thrown in? Yes. Would the movie (and likely the book) have been better without it? Definitely.Maybe my age is speaking for me here- but I didn't notice that this movie's special effects were any better or worse than other movies out right now. (I grew up in the 90's- you want corny special effects I've got a whole list of movies for you.)Was it Jennifer Lawrence Hunger Games (the first one) comparable? No. But it doesn't deserve all the flak it's getting. I thought Liev Schreiber was great in his role and liked almost all the other actors. As an aside this is much better than Twilight and Kristen whatever her name is's impersonable performance.There were a couple of twists thrown in that granted- were a little conspicuous but I enjoyed the movie regardless. I probably won't go see the sequel in theaters (if they even make them at this point) but I'd definitely rent them.Also- if there are any fellow gamers reading this and curious about it, It's heavily reminiscent of The Last of Us. Someone else on IMDb mentioned the movie feels like a video game and that was definitely true, but as a gamer perhaps I simply didn't mind. Heck I'd even say it added to its charm.",The 5th Wave
408,sarahlramey,Good movie!,10,14 May 2016,"Just watched the 5th Wave and really enjoyed it! Its a good film with a similar concept to the Hunger Games and Divergent. I wanted to write a review because the film received low ratings on IMDb. Trust me when I say I've seen bad movies, but this certainly isn't one of them! It's action packed and keeps the viewer intrigued. I really hope they make a sequel because I'm curious to see what happens to the three main characters Cassie, Ben, and Evan. The film is based on the books so maybe I'll have to read them to hold me over! In the meantime, I would definitely recommend this for movie night. Plus who doesn't like an end of the world survival movie?!",The 5th Wave
409,jake-69674,"Overall a good movie, even thought it is a play off of others",8,20 May 2016,"To start, I never read the book, but after watching this I actually want to, and that's very rare. Overall, it's aliens attacking the Earth strategically to eliminate humans, but the alien 5th wave is merely using children (who are easier to manipulate) to eliminate the rest of the humans by misleading them. So yea this does take a piece from post-apocalyptic type movies involving alien invasions, while also taking from The Hunger Games, Divergent, and a bit of Red Dawn with turning the kids into true soldiers. Kind of a ridiculous to train the enemy on how to kill when they eventually pull a Frankenstein and go after the creator who is the real enemy. I'm a huge fan of Divergent, The Hunger Games and Red Dawn, and pretty much any post-apocalyptic or natural disaster types of movies.To sum this up, if you're a fan of any of these things, or the actual book, you should see this movie. I personally hope they make the full movie trilogy. Due to the way the aliens are presented in this movie, I picture the sequels to be somewhat of a Red Dawn/Divergent combo in nature. Or you can compare it to the show The 100 for the same reasons. Either way, I believe the sequels will be worth it.",The 5th Wave
410,trombleyempire,A chick flick not well disguised as Sci-Fi,2,23 May 2016,"This movie has a few good stars such as Ron Livingston and Liev Schreiber, and their acting is average as a result of this movie, but it is not their fault that this movie comes up short. It was poor writing, horrible directing, and lack of categorization that made this a stinker. This movie is classified as sci-fi, but it reminds me of an unpopular chick-flick cinema movie that your girlfriend makes you watch because she is obsessed with drama and has little taste for action. I rarely review movies unless I love them or hate them, but this movie deserves less mention than any other movie I have seen in the last 6 months. Please, still watch it, but expect disappointment.",The 5th Wave
411,magnum-77743,Bad girlish movie based on a (perhaps good) novel,1,26 May 2016,"The movie started interesting in making the protagonist kill a presumable innocent victim. Great! And it followed up with narration and flashbacks. Not to great... . That's in my opinion the cheapest way to give background to a story. Why not let the story unfold itself. And what quality the flash back had! Basically introducing the whole plot of this movie.So the ""US Army"" survived the first four waves. They shoot civilians and leaving the bodies. Only taking children? Some would call this clues for what's up next. I call that idiotic screenplay for children.Next point up the story line split - not showing the protagonist brother in the US Army camp, but to show some other guy who was briefly introduced in one of the flashbacks I guess? Anyhow the plot is getting pushed forward hard... Is this based on a novel, I thought. (Spoiler Warning: It is!) Coming back to the protagonist herself. Without flashbacks counting we have a bout 10minutes of screen time half way through the movie. Then she got shot on a highway. After she inspected recently dead bodies who were shot recently... I have so mush empathy right about now. Then saved by a mysterious stranger who is definitely not an alien...After that I quit the movie and skipped to the end and I got my big surprise! US Army base is managed by aliens, kids are getting trained to shoot against their own kind and the fishy fella - well he's an alien alright, but he discovered love by not shooting the protagonist. Crazy twist. Also he is a terrorist to his own kind placing bombs on that army base.Can't wait to ignore the sequel!",The 5th Wave
412,maxxfenning,Very Accurate( Book-Wise),8,29 May 2016,"I always get angry when directors ruin perfectly good books( Don't get me started on the romance in The Giver), but this one was pretty much on point with every detail. They say that the romance is too sappy, but if you actually read the book, the author does a good job removing what would otherwise be a Twilight romance story. The author did a great job, and I think the director did a great job adapting it. I personally only liked Cassie's acting( the others were at least better than the boy from the Jungle Book), and I think that they kept in a good amount of detail( although they left out some details and changed some things, and that added a few plot holes.) In all, I think it was a good movie, and you truly should read the book before you say anything about the film. It always helps to know what you're talking about.",The 5th Wave
413,blakecormier,"Twilight, but aliens.",3,8 June 2016,"Wow. Yet another steaming pile of Hollywood garbage filled with thin white ""good looking"" people instead of actors. If it weren't for some huge writing flaws like gaping holes in logic, super flimsy character development, completely unnecessary romantic ""tension"" crowbarred-in and the aforementioned models-where-actors-should-be trope, the idea and story could have been pretty cool.I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie, but honestly just had to force myself through from about the half hour mark.Adding insult to injury is the very obvious set up for what the film makers are most likely hoping will be two or more sequels.Twilight, but aliens. Not even cool or scary aliens. Just lame, romantic aliens. Or incognito aliens. Huge yawn.",The 5th Wave
414,bar-25329,Great movie in one sentence.,10,19 November 2016,"This movie is a fantastic movie , people who say it isn't should look deeper into themselves and listen to the characters talk , they talk about love , how it affects us. How it is real and not fake , that you need to know you side , which is good or bad ? figure out yourself and believe in what you stand for. Do what you want as you'd like it to be, trust the ones who give u hope and flawless happiness. This movie talks about understanding things more clearer. What seems so real can be fake , if someone tells you something , always have a doubt , stick to it and figure it out until you know its the truth or it is fake.

415,kaylaiorio,Worst Book-Movie Adaptation I've Ever Seen.,1,23 November 2016,"If you read the book, I urge you not to watch this film, ever. There is no character development, and the acting is sub-par at best. To begin, they add unnecessary scenes with Cassie and Ben in some feeble attempt at a Team Jacob/Team Edward Twilight type love triangle, which is non existent in the novel. The character interaction is sloppy at best. The chemistry between Cassie and her other love interest Evan is hard to believe to begin with, and with bringing in Cassie's long-lost ""high school love"" it gets even worse. They barely introduce integral characters that make it nearly impossible to carry on with a second and possible third movie adaptation. The special effects made me cringe, and in some places were completely unnecessary. The plot seems hastily placed together in an attempt to make the movie in alignment with the release of the 3rd and final installment of the series. Giving it a 1 is pushing it.",The 5th Wave

425,davisnola,Amazing Storyline and Beautiful Acting Throughout,10,24 April 2018,"I would recommend this film to anyone seeking adventure, drama, and action in a film. This film is really the first of its kind it includes all types of techniques from the actors and also the fact about camera focuses on the emotions of the characters which emphasizes what the film is about and links in still with the main story line. This movie have a lot of similarities with the film ""Divergent"". Both movies have been based on a society that is divided into different groups. For example, Divergent society was divided in five fractions: Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Erudite the intelligent, Candor the honest, and Amity the peaceful. On the other hand, ""The 5th Wave"" was divided into two groups: the normal people and people who have diseases. This movie is about four waves deadly attacking Earth, leaving every state and every country ruined. The aliens drain energy and create diseases that effected millions of people and died. The main character in this movie is Cassie. Cassie lost her mother by the disease. The Army came to take the people to the army base and that's how Cassie father died, army people gunned him and others down. The survivors was transferred to the army base on a school bus. When Cassie left the bus to get her brother stuffed animal the bus was driving off, Cassie was running trying to catch up with the bus but she didn't make it. Cassie goes on adventure to look for her little brother named Sam that was left on a bus. While Cassie looks for her little brother Sam, Sam is at the military base being trained by the military to fight the enemy. You can not tell whose the enemy or not because they all looked the same.",The 5th Wave
