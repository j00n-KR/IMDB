0,MartinHafer,"Good but we've seen it all before,...",7,28 January 2006,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's one of Wayne's better films and it's nice to see him paired with Robert Mitchum. However, it very quickly became obvious to me that this is essentially a remake of Wayne's earlier picture, Rio Bravo. The plot is the same and Mitchum is playing the same drunk character that Dean Martin played in Rio Bravo. The earlier film is much better--mostly because it was so much more original. Yes, I'm sure some astute viewers will also find a few other minor differences between the films, but overall it's almost the exact same experience. So my advice is try to see Rio Bravo first--then, if you'd like, see this film. After all, in 4 out of 5 cases original films are better than remakes.",El Dorado
1,TheLittleSongbird,Elegiac masterwork,10,6 February 2011,"El Dorado is a wonderful film. It is elegiac, always entertaining, skillful and I think warm-hearted too. The film looks beautiful, the cinematography and scenery are both a delight to the ears. Nelson Riddle's score is pleasant too, while the film is brilliantly directed by Howard Hawks, the script is thoughtful and entertaining, the story never loses momentum and the pace while deliberately elegiac is spot on. There is also a superbly staged preface, which is one of the assets that gave El Dorado its heart. The acting from the leads is superb, John Wayne is a great charismatic presence here and Robert Mitchum gives one of his best performances, and they work very well together. All in all, a wonderful film and a textbook example of a fine movie of its genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",El Dorado
2,bkoganbing,"""Ride Baldy Ride, to the end of the rainbow.""",9,5 February 2006,"Unless you count their joint appearance in The Longest Day, El Dorado deserves its place in Hollywood history for being the only co-starring effort of John Wayne and Robert Mitchum.Besides being good friends Wayne and Mitchum were both known for being able to drink just about anyone else in the film business under the table and still report to work in the morning, lines letter perfect. But Mitchum was not allowed in the Wayne home because Pilar Wayne never forgave him for ruining their honeymoon when Mitchum backed out of Blood Alley and Wayne had to star as well as produce it.I also think that the Duke was leery about Mitchum stealing too many scenes which he does when they are on the screen together. In this tighter and faster remake of Rio Bravo, Wayne is his usual stand up hero, rough and tough, but who lives by a code. Mitchum is the flawed one. During an interlude of several months in the film, Mitchum becomes enamored of an unseen woman, loses her, and becomes a drunk.Which leads me to one of the funniest scenes ever in a Wayne film. When Christopher George and fellow gunmen are hired by villain Ed Asner to run R.G. Armstrong and his family off their ranch, Wayne has to sober up Sheriff Mitchum and fast. Every time I watch El Dorado, I get hysterical every time I watch James Caan pour a homemade remedy down Mitchum's throat with Wayne and Arthur Hunnicutt holding him down. And the reactions afterwards, absolutely priceless. This is where Mitchum steals the movie.As in many a Howard Hawks film, there is a theme of professionalism that runs through it. Whether it's Cary Grant and his fellow pilots flying over treacherous terrain in South America, Humphrey Bogart with his charter boat business in the Caribbean, or Wayne and Mitchum going up against fellow professional Christopher George, it's doing the job and doing it well for it's own reward.The final gunfight is also a classic. Let's just say that Mitchum and Wayne are not at their best, but they make up for it with some help from interested friends.This is one of the best films, in the top 10 for both these guys and shouldn't be missed.",El Dorado
3,Leofwine_draca,Strong pairing,8,22 September 2019,"EL DORADO is another strong pairing for director Howard Hawks and star John Wayne, and possibly my favourite western that they made together. This one has an easygoing feel, a likeable storyline and a great performance from Wayne, possibly at his most iconic. The fact that he suffers from physical disability here gives his character a kind of warmth and fragility that you don't normally see from the impassive action man. The supporting cast is particularly excellent, with impeccable turns from an up-and-coming James Caan as Mississippi and old-timer Robert Mitchum as the drunk sheriff. Christopher George is also particularly good as one of the villains; a great make-up job there. The narrative moves along at a good clip, ably mixing suspense, shoot-outs and dialogue, all of which don't disappoint.",El Dorado
4,SnoopyStyle,Well done John Wayne western,7,6 September 2013,"Gunman Cole Thornton (John Wayne) turns down a job with rancher Bart Jason (Ed Asner), who is trying to steal water from his neighbor, when he finds he must fight an old friend Sheriff J.P. Harrah (Robert Mitchum). Later, he returns to town with youngster Mississippi (James Caan) and finds J.P. in a drunken state. Together they must fight off Bart's hired hands.Howard Hawks directed this traditional western with John Wayne doing his best John Wayne impression. It is a little too long at over 2 hours. But it is still a great western. It's great to see a young James Caan and John Wayne is right at home.",El Dorado
5,Prismark10,More Rio Bravo,5,23 December 2017,"Howard Hawks basically remakes Rio Bravo and invites John Wayne to the party again. Wayne is the veteran professional gunman, Cole Thornton who turns down a rich rancher as the drunken sheriff in town, Robert Mitchum is an old buddy who has taken to drink.When the rich rancher hires another gunman, Cole, Sheriff Harrah, his deputy and hot headed young cardsharp, Mississippi (James Caan) band together to stop the wealthy rancher bullying the poor ranchers over the water rights. However they might not be a match to the rich rancher's posse. The rancher having been jailed by the Sheriff, his men are out to spring him.Mitchum is a drunk, his deputy is too old, Mississippi is to inexperienced and volatile, Cole has a bullet lodged near his spine.The film is not as good as Rio Bravo although this is slightly shorter and in some ways the casting is better. Caan is a better actor than Ricky Nelson for example.Hawks does place an in joke against the rising new wave of French cinema where the Sheriff shoots a piano and not the piano player. However the film is hokey and looks old fashioned given it was made in 1967 and movies like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid hovering ahead.",El Dorado
6,classicsoncall,"""Ride, boldly ride, till you find El Dorado...""",8,7 June 2015,"The comparisons to ""Rio Bravo"" are unmistakable and if you've seen that picture further words aren't necessary. What I had to constantly keep reminding myself throughout the story was that Robert Mitchum was the drunk sheriff and not Dean Martin. Or as John Wayne's character Cole Thornton would remark - ""I'm lookin' at a tin star with a drunk pinned on it"".After watching about sixty of John Wayne's films over the years and catching this one earlier today, it struck me that his performance here was about the most natural in any of the ones I've seen. In other words, he didn't even seem to be acting most of the time, just carrying on with buddies Mitchum, James Caan and old-timer Arthur Hunnicutt who probably had the best lines of banter throughout going back and forth with Cole and J.P. Harrah (Mitchum). I know, Wayne detractors will say he wasn't acting in any of his pictures, but I think that would be a disservice to the Duke.So as a big time TV and Western movie fan, I thought it was pretty cool that the film makers had two thirds of the 'Rifleman' regular cast show up here. Paul Fix had the role of old Doc Miller and Johnny Crawford showed up long enough to get shot by Cole Thornton in an early scene. Wouldn't it have been cool if Chuck Connors had a role in this one? Instead, we have almost one-armed John Wayne twirling his rifle like Lucas McCain did on his own show.As for James Caan, I don't know, he seemed to be out of place here a couple of times, especially when he took off the hat. Joey MacDonald (Michele Carey) liked him better with it off, but to me he looked a little goofy with his hair plastered down like that. His Chinese impression was a bit embarrassing too, and I don't mean that in a politically correct way. It was just plain old embarrassing.But overall, a decent Western and if you're a fan of the principles, you'll have to add this one to your watch list. For trivia fans, John Wayne rides an appaloosa in the picture, going by the name of Cochise. I thought that was pretty cool.",El Dorado
7,gavin6942,Not the Best Work From John Wayne or Howard Hawks,6,9 January 2011,"While I am not particularly a fan of westerns, I gave this one a shot because I like Howard Hawks and John Wayne is pretty much the greatest western actor of his generation. I must say that while it was okay, it did not meet my hopes.James Caan does not seem to me to get the full force he needs. The film is a bit slow up until the shootout in the church, and even then it is very ""old school"" because you can get shot without bullet holes or blood. The continuity is also questionable, as Caan's character switches his crutch repeatedly.I have heard this film is an unofficial remake of ""Rio Bravo"", but I have not seen that one and cannot say. However, I will give it points for including the Edgar Allan Poe poem, even if that is probably an anachronism.",El Dorado
8,ccthemovieman-1,A Pleasant Surprise,8,24 October 2006,"This was a pretty solid western, one I enjoyed more than I thought I would. What I liked about it were the interesting characters and the fact it was nicely filmed, as westerns tend to be. People focus on the big stars of this film and often miss how good the visuals are in here.John Wayne, Robert Mitchum and James Caan all played characters that were fun to watch. When I first saw this about 10 years ago, it was a shock to see how young Caan looked. It had to be one of his first films. Six years after this, he made it big in ""The Godfather.""Wayne and Mitchum, of course, were already major motion picture celebrities and I liked the way they traded off each other in this movie. It was really good to see these two guys in the same film. With those two, and the nice photography, this would be a good pickup on DVD.",El Dorado
9,rmax304823,Three Fast Gunmen.,7,14 June 2008,"The director, Howard Hawks, was always irritated when he was asked if this was a remake of his earlier, highly successful ""Rio Bravo."" He'd point out differences in the details. If, in ""Rio Bravo,"" it was the deputy who was a drunk, this time it's the sheriff who's the drunk. If Hawks actually believed this, he was in -- how you say? -- in denial.It's pretty much a remake and, though it's not as cheerful and engaging and funny as the original, it's still pretty engaging and funny. The gags are a little different. They would be, because Hawks encouraged improvisation from his actors or other crew members. As an example, at the end, both Robert Mitchum and John Wayne have been crippled by gun shot wounds and each must hobble around on a crutch. Mitchum kept forgetting which arm to put his crutch under, switching it from one arm to the other, and when people began ribbing him about it, Hawks decided to work the joke into the script.Like ""Rio Bravo"", the story has a bad guy (Edward Asner) captured and put into the town jail while the town waits for the irregular visit of the U. S. Marshall. The sheriff (Mitchum) and his deputies (Wayne, Arthur Hunnicut, and James Caan) hole up in the jail, assisted by one or two girl friends. Wayne is captured and the Asner is released. A final shoot out resolves all problems.It's imaginatively executed. There is a shot, most unusual for Hawks, in which a villain's dead body drops from a bell tower directly down onto the camera. The conversational contretemps, while not up to Hawks' best, are still pretty amusing. Hunnicutt complains to Mitchum: ""The first time I wanted to do nuthin' for ye and ye don't want me to do it."" Mitchum looks at Wayne and asks, ""Is there something wrong with that or am I still hung over?"" It sounds as if Hunnicutt fumbled the line and Hawks incorporated it into the script. Here, as elsewhere, Hawks took advantage of the opportunity to stick current, future, and hoped-for female companions into the story. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it didn't. Here, it didn't. By the way, the bartender, the guy who winds up with a palm full of splinters, is Mitchum's brother John.Still, it's not ""Rio Bravo."" For one thing, the score by Nelson Riddle lacks Dmitri Tiompkin's pompous CLANGS and BLATTS, almost self parodies. For another, it's a bit more serious than ""Rio Bravo."" When somebody gets hurt or shot here, he really gets hurt or shot -- not to mention bashed in the face by a rifle butt. Wayne suffers from a periodic paralysis of his side, the result of Michelle Carey's bullet through the retroperitoneal sac. One wonders if Hawks was coming to terms with old age -- whatever ""coming to terms with"" means in that context. James Caan quotes from the poem, ""El Dorado"", by Edgar Allan Poe -- ""And when his strength failed him at length, he met a pilgrim shadow."" It's a much darker film than ""Rio Bravo"", and not just because of the violence and infirmity. Much of the story takes place at night. Sometimes it's almost too dark to see who's who. And the cast doesn't seem to be having quite as much fun. The climactic conflict of ""Rio Bravo"" has everyone out in blazing sunshine, throwing dynamite at the villains and wisecracking with one another. There's nothing to laugh at in this shoot out.All of that is to say that, while ""Rio Bravo"" is the better of the two films, this one is nothing to be sneezed at. If the earlier film hadn't come so near perfection for its type, ""El Dorado"" would have been hailed as a Hawks triumph. As it is, it's pretty good.",El Dorado
10,ma-cortes,"Outstanding Western gathers together a gunman , a drunk sheriff , a young hopeful , an old man and sets them up in a jail",7,2 September 2012,"Involving and fascinating Western in which John Wayne helped by a motley group taking on a corrupt land baron . It is filled with crisp action , thrills , emotion , humor and masterfully directed by Howard Hawks , being a take-off based on ¨Rio Bravo¨ . It deals with Cole Thornton (John Wayne) , a gunslinger for hire who suffers badly from age and gun wound , he joins forces with an old friend , Sheriff J.P. Hara (Robert Mitchum) in a dusty little town . Together with an old Indian fighter and a gambler , they help a rancher (R.G. Armstrong) and his family fight a rival rancher that is trying to steal their water . But the Duke and drunken sheriff Mitchum take prisoner the cattle baron (Eward Ashner) and imprison him into jail for being brought to justice . Then the enemies take on a blockade of gunfighters surrounding the prison. Duke along with a shotgun-toting old loony (the scene-stealing Arthur Hunnicutt as a half-crazed sympathetic old man with a trumpet and in similar role to Walter Brennan) are besieged and only helped by the hot-head young named Missisipi (James Caan) whose finger itches demoniacally on the trigger every time he gets a nasty guy in his sights . All of them fighting for their lives against the baron land and his hired killers (Christopher George , Jim Davis)Action western, snappy dialog , shoot-outs at regular intervals, and humor abounds in this magnificent film whose roles are splendidly portrayed . It packs larger-than-life characters, uproarious events and lively happenings . It is an elegy on lost youth assuaged by friendship and comradeship among them . The Duke carries strong acting on his brawny shoulders and perfectly does , though most of the scenes showing John Wayne running were performed by a double . It's basically a lighthearted action Western and being mainly lifted out by Robert Mitchum 's wonderfully acting , his bathtub scene was largely Robert's invention, members of the crew were laughing while it was being filmed at the idea of Mitchum being embarrassed in front of a woman . Delightful main and support cast formed by several youthful costars as James Caan , Charlotte Holt and Michelle Carey ; adding brief interventions from Adam Roarke , Johnny Crawford , Robert Donner and Paul Fix . And of course, top-drawer John Wayne , few stars could match his ability to dominate a scene . Arch-conservative John Wayne did not get along with actor Edward Asner, whose politics were quite liberal, during filming, and constantly referred to Asner as ""that New York actor"". Wayne was disappointed that the movie was released at the same time as his next movie, ¨The War Wagon¨ ; however, despite this film receiving generally poor reviews and being seen as old-fashioned and out of tune with the times, both movies proved to be hugely successful at the box office. Glittering Technicolor cinematography by Harold Rosson who adds much to the setting of this unique Western , the scenes of the town during daytime were filmed on location in Kanab, Utah and Old Tucson, Arizona , but all the nighttime scenes were filmed in the studio. Marvelous musical score by Nelson Riddle (Batman TV theme) including emotive song at main titles . These opening credits feature a montage of original paintings that depict various scenes of cowboy life in the Old West, the artist was Olaf Wieghorst who appears in the film as the Gunsmith . This overlong, too much-acclaimed and very gripping Western will appeal to John Wayne fans . Rating : Above average, essential and indispensable Western , a masterpiece horse opera whose reputation has improved over the years . The motion picture is well directed Howard Hawks supported by John Wayne , it's a nice Western made by these two giants . Hawks proved to be a Western expert as proved in ¨Big sky¨, ¨The outlaw¨ and ¨Red River ¨.Rating : Good and great fun , though over lengthy and displays a number of similarities to previous ¨Rio Bravo¨ , quintaessential Hawks Western at the peak of his powers , starred by Wayne , Mitchum , Walter Brennan , Ricky Nelson and Angie Dickinson . ¨El Dorado¨ is more or less a remake of Rio Bravo, although Howard Hawks always denied this. Followed by a second reworking titled ¨Rio Lobo¨ with Wayne , George Rivero ,Jennifer O'Neill , Sherry Lansing ,Chris Mitchum , Victor French and Jack Elam playing a virtual retreat of the previous role played by Walter Brennan and Arthur Hunnicut and of course the great John Wayne who repeats in the excellent trilogy , an exciting , witty and deeply moving masterpiece .",El Dorado
11,moonspinner55,"""Rio Bravo"" on the geriatric end, but with the expected western pleasures...",6,1 June 2008,"It may be 1967, but director Howard Hawks and screenwriter Leigh Brackett, working from Harry Brown's book ""The Stars in Their Courses"", turn back the clock with this leisurely-paced variation on 1959's ""Rio Bravo"". John Wayne stars as a hired gunslinger with a big heart (it's pretty much the same role he had the last time), while Robert Mitchum stands in for Dean Martin as the besotted sheriff. Charlene Holt takes over the proverbial love-interest part formerly filled by Angie Dickinson, and James Caan substitutes (quite well) for Ricky Nelson as the young greenhorn. It's acceptable fare, but not exceptional; the joshing and fisticuffs are rousing, but the shootouts aren't choreographed well and the romantic asides bubble under the main action. Hawks is hardly reticent in regards to introducing these new relationships, and much of the film is made up of camaraderie. That seems to suit the Duke just fine, as he looks more comfortable alongside Mitchum and Caan than with Martin and Nelson (though he is seven years older here and obviously not as energetic). This production, most of which was filmed in the studio, looks just like a western from the previous decade, with only the wear and tear of the main players to remind us we've moved on but that Hawks and Wayne have not. **1/2 from ****",El Dorado
12,hitchcockthelegend,Big heavyweight movie all round.,8,4 February 2010,"Directed by Howard Hawks and starring John Wayne & Robert Mitchum, it's safe to say that El Dorado comes with some pretty tough credentials. Thankfully the expectation that comes with such a teaming is well and truly met. The plot is a familiar one in the context of Wayne & Hawks, if you have seen Rio Bravo? And liked it? The chances are you will like this one too.Wayne is Cole Thornton, a hired gun who is asked to come on the payroll of El Dorado landowner Bart Jason (Ed Asner), who is involved with a land struggle with the MacDonald family. Cole finds his old friend J.P. Harrah (Mitchum) is sheriff of the town, and J.P. advises his old pal that any involvement with Jason will result in J.P. enforcing the law. As it transpires, circumstances between the MacDonald's and Cole lead to Cole taking arms against Jason and his thug followers. So the sheriff, an old Indian fighter called Bull Harris (Arthur Hunnicutt) & a young gambler, who's handy with a knife, called Alan Bourdillion 'Mississippi' Traherne (James Caan) aim to bring down the might of Jason together.Adapted from the book The Stars in Their Courses by Harry Brown, this was the second to last film that Howard Hawks would direct. Coming as it did in the late 60s it appears to be somewhat undervalued on the great director's CV. Probably due in no small part to the regard that Rio Bravo is held, of which this is pretty much a remake of. Yet, and I whisper it quietly, El Dorado is arguably the better film in terms of performances and the telling of Hawksian themes.Given that Wayne & Mitchum were good friends away from the screen, it's no great surprise to find the chemistry between them is top dollar. They feed of each others' machismo to deliver a tough picture, yet one that's still joyously fun. The end result is a pic that manages to deftly portray many themes, that of loyalty, togetherness, forgiveness, respect and professionalism. The two principal stars are aided by both Caan and Hunnicutt, who offer a notable young & old side of the mythical West, with age, and ageing, a prominent point of note played out by the knowing director.El Dorado looks to be a film where all involved are comfortable in what they are making. Nothing feels forced or hindered by pointless filler. It's true that the film is more in favour of dialogue over bravado action, though what action there is is adroitly handled by the old hands and the youthful Caan with his sawn off shotgun. This is a story without gimmicks, one which isn't ambling along as an excuse for a shoot out come the end. There's a lot to be said for good old fashioned story telling, and we get that here. Intelligence and sincerity throughout, and it's damn funny to boot, El Dorado is a fine movie that holds up very well in each and every decade that passes. 8/10",El Dorado
13,Hey_Sweden,"Ride, boldly ride. A bugle-tooting good time.",9,16 November 2016,"This slam-bang Western is truly a very fine diversion, with filmmaker Howard Hawks at the top of his game. Hawks works from an engaging screenplay by Leigh Brackett, who (loosely) adapted the Harry Brown novel ""The Stars in Their Courses"", and gets excellent performances out of just about everybody. It gets serious, but never too serious, and is generously laced with comedy. The fact that this was a big box office success showed that audiences still had an appetite for what could be seen as ""old-fashioned"" entertainment.The Duke plays Cole Thornton, an aging gunslinger approached by nefarious rancher Bart Jason (Ed Asner) to work for him. Thornton turns the job down when he realizes that he'll have to go up against old friend J.P. Harrah (Robert Mitchum), the sheriff of the nearby town. Circumstances leave Thornton feeling indebted to the MacDonald family, the peaceable folk whose ranch is targeted by Jason. So he joins their cause, and is soon working alongside a young gambler named Mississippi (James Caan), who likes to use knives because he really isn't good with a gun.The Duke and Mitchum are a believable pair of friends, and together with a baby faced Caan (a few years away from scoring big as Sonny in ""The Godfather"") and a steadfast Arthur Hunnicutt as Bull, they all make a good team. The cast is full of good actors, with Christopher George a pleasure to watch as a smooth, confident hired gun. R.G. Armstrong, Paul Fix, Robert Donner, Johnny Crawford, and Adam Roarke all put in appearances as well, and the lovely ladies present also have good roles with which to work: Charlene Holt as Maudie, and feisty Michele Carey as ""Joey"" MacDonald, one of Armstrongs' kids. Olaf Wieghorst, who plays gunsmith Swede Larsen, did the beautiful paintings for the credit sequence.First rate photography combines with enjoyable atmosphere, some fun lines of dialogue, and plenty of Western violence in the ""clutch yourself and fall down"" tradition, which all help to make this a wonderful viewing experience. Nice music score by Nelson Riddle, too.There is a scene where Mississippi pretends to be a Chinaman in order to confuse a henchman, and people could easily see it as being racist. It has often been cut out of TV showings of the film.Essentially a reworking of Hawks' earlier ""Rio Bravo"", although Hawks himself would always deny this.9 out of 10.",El Dorado
14,LeonLouisRicci,Wayne at His BestMitchum Even BetterCaan is Also Very Good,9,29 August 2015,"By 1966 both John Wayne and Howard Hawks seemed to Dial Their Prospective Macho Personas Down a Notch and both are the Better for it. This Film is one of the Best for both the Actor and Director.Hawks and Wayne are more Natural here. The Director was always Striving for Realism but Rarely Attained and Strained most of the Time. His Trademark Overlapping Dialog Never seemed Real, Just a Filmmaker Pretentiously and Painfully Trying to be Real.In This Movie the Duke's Dialog Delivery is a Bit more Low Key and He Doesn't Project as much as Usual and the Words come out more Natural and Believable. Ditto for the Action Scenes.Robert Mitchum is Excellent and is the Best Actor on the set. He Dominates every Scene He is In and this is one of His Best Later Day Performances. The Ensemble Cast Work Well together with relative Newcomer James Caan managing to Hold His Own among the Two Towering Stars.The Supporting Players also Contribute to make this a much Better Film than the Stiff and Stagey ""Rio Bravo"" (1959). The Violence is at Times Brutal and the Cinematography is Wider and more Sumptuous than Bravo.Overall, with the help of a Great Sidekick Arthur Hunnicutt Providing the Levity and a Couple of Strong Female Characters, this is one of the Best Films for Hawks, Wayne, and Mitchum and really does Overshadow its Overrated Brother ""Rio Bravo"".",El Dorado
15,CinemaSerf,"Plenty of twists, turns and chemistry.",8,18 December 2019,"Definitely one of Howard Hawks' better collaborations with John Wayne. A reasonably strong story about a rancher and his family trying to defy an avaricious and violent Ed Asner who is trying to take over everything he can. There are similarities with ""Rio Bravo"" but I think here there is more tangible chemistry between Wayne and Robert Mitchum as the washed up drunk of a sheriff. James Caan brings some cheeky charm to his role as ""Mississippi"" and Arthur Hunnicutt takes on the reliable, foil role usually played by Walter Brennan well. As ever with these films, the leading ladies have virtually nothing to work with and this, for Charlene Holt, is no exception.",El Dorado

18,zardoz-13,"Howard Hawks' ""El Dorado"" Is Pure Gold!",10,16 June 2009,"""Red River"" director Howard Hawks' ""El Dorado"" qualifies as a leisurely, old-fashioned oater that conjures up more hilarity with its frequent comic interludes than its serious moments. Mind you, this 1967 John Wayne & Robert Mitchum western possesses a couple of unsavory moments, principally when men brandish their six-guns and blast away at each other without a qualm, but the violence here is nothing compared to the vicious Spaghetti westerns made in Europe during the late 1960s. Anybody who enjoys Hawks' westerns should not be surprised that Hawks and scenarist Leigh Brackett dusted off the plot to ""Rio Bravo"" and essentially recycled scenes and characters.Hawks cast Robert Mitchum as the drunken that Dean Martin had played in ""Rio Bravo."" Arthur Hunnicutt takes over for Walter Brennan, while James Caan substitutes for Ricky Nelson in a different role. Hawks changed Caan's supporting role from Nelson's accurate shooting gunslinger to the worst shot on the frontier. As in ""Rio Bravo,"" the heroes hole up in a jail with a prisoner and await the arrival of the territorial lawman while the villain's henchmen keep them bottled up in town. This time, however, John Wayne plays a drifting gunfighter with an Achilles heel, while Mitchum wears the sheriff's badge. Hawks and Brackett whittled down the female participation to an older woman, Charlene Holt, who walks in from time to time, but never intrudes on the action like Angie Dickinson did in ""Rio Bravo."" Meanwhile, a young slip of a girl, cute Michele Carey, has a somewhat bigger part as a hot-headed babe who wounds our hero. Nevertheless, ""El Dorado"" is an immensely likable western with clever dialogue, interesting characters, and funny jokes. Attention deficient audiences may complain this 126 minute melodrama drags and sags when it should raise hell and holler.Hawks and Brackett provide the ground work for the plot in the opening scene when Sheriff J.P. Harrah (Robert Mitchum of ""Cape Fear"") confronts Cole Thornton (John Wayne of ""Hatari"") in the washroom of a local saloon. Cole has come to El Dorado to hire his gun out to ranch owner Bart Jason (Edward Asner of ""The Satan Bug""), but Harrah dissuades him from taking the job. Harrah explains that Jason is a greedy rancher who wants to expand his spread, but he needs water. Incidentally, the Bart Jason character resembles Hawks' ""Rio Lobo"" villain Ketchum in that Jason showed up in El Dorado with a lot of money when everybody else in Texas was dead broke. Harrah elaborates that Jason wants to run the cattle rancher Kevin MacDonald (R. G. Armstrong of ""Ride the High Country"") out of the country because he cannot force MacDonald to sell out to him. Cole decides to accommodate Harrah and pull out. He rides out to Jason's ranch and refuses to hire out to him. Meantime, Doc Miller (Paul Fix) has sent warning out to MacDonald that Cole Thornton is on Jason's payroll. MacDonald and his men scatter and he leaves his youngest son Luke (Johnny Crawford of ""The Rifleman"") to serve as a look-out and fire in the air if he should see Thornton.After Cole leaves Jason's ranch, he rides toward the role where Luke is sleeping. A startled Luke leaps up and fires at Cole rather than shooting in the air. Without a second thought, Cole plugs Luke. Luke commits suicide because he has been gut shot and feels that he cannot survive such a painful wound. Cole takes Luke's body to the MacDonald ranch. Joey MacDonald (Michele Carey of ""Dirty Dingus Magee"") vows to kill Cole. She lays in ambush and wounds him. Doc Miller refuses to extract the slug because it lies too close to Cole's spine and he fears that he would do more damage. He advises Cole to find ""one of them new-fangled squirts"" to remove it, ""but don't wait too long to do it."" Cole rides off to the border for a job and winds up in a border town where he runs into scar-faced killer Nelse McLeod (Christopher George of ""The Rat Patrol"") and his gunmen. McLeod and his gunmen are heading for El Dorado to take the same job with Bart Jason that Cole turned down.

Cole advises Mississippi to get rid of his oddball hat and get a gun. Mississippi asks Cole to teach him how to shoot, but Mississippi is such a bad shot that Cole gets him a sawed-off, double-barreled shotgun with the stock cut down to a plow-handle. Initially, Cole doesn't want anything to do with Mississippi, but Mississippi knows that Cole is heading back to El Dorado. It seems that Sheriff J.P. Harrah tangled ""with a wandering petticoat"" and lost. Since his ill-fated romance, Harrah has retreated into a whiskey bottle and Cole fears that Harrah will prove easy prey for McLeod. When they reach El Dorado, Maudie (Charlene Holt of ""Redline 7000"") brings Cole up to speed on the situation. Cole and Harrah tangle in the jail when Cole tries to awaken the drunken Harrah. Mississippi whips together a concoction to sober up Harrah and an old frontier scout Bull (seasoned character actor Arthur Hunnicutt of ""The Big Sky"") helps him acquire the ingredients.Jason's men wound another MacDonald and Harrah takes Jason prisoner while McLeod lays siege to the jail. Cole's Achilles heel gunshot wound strikes him at an inopportune time and McLeod takes him hostage and exchanges Cole for Jason. The heroes, both crippled from gunshot wounds, surprise McLeod and Joe mows down Jason in a savage shoot'em up. Christopher George doesn't get much screen time but he makes a memorable villain. Hunnicutt steals the show with his homespun humor.",El Dorado

Minorities take another lethal hit in EL DORADO, as the flick's most extensive shootout takes place in a Spanish Mission. This church's bells wind up holier than Swiss cheese thanks to the band of sacrilegious thugs led by Wayne, who also manage to blast some of the Sacred Gizmos from their wall niches with direct hits. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of EL DORADO is its take on American sexual mores. Whereas BREAKFAST campaigned to portray prostitution as a victimless ""crime,"" EL DORADO's ""Maudie"" character is carefully drawn to boost American acceptance of the Old World's traditional Menage a Trois. Though there's no graphic depiction of a three-way featuring J.P., Maudie, and Cole, her key comment that she's ""girl enough for both of"" the guys is highlighted in the trailer, as well as the feature.",El Dorado
20,HotToastyRag,Mediocre western with a few jokes,5,22 August 2018,"I'm not much of a John Wayne fan, but I do love Robert Mitchum, which is why I rented El Dorado. They play old friends reunited in a western town to try and keep the peace between two rival families. Bob is the town's sheriff, but his drunken ways have lost him the respect of everyone in town, hence the need for John to come and help. Meanwhile, a trigger-happy James Caan comes along for the ride, and Charlene Holt turns out to have dated both leads!The only reason I didn't fall asleep during this one is because of Robert Mitchum; usually westerns have to be really good to keep me riveted. As much as I love my celebrity boyfriend, though, it's a part many actors could have played. The character is a comic relief, crying when people in town laugh at him and getting embarrassed when people walk in on him in the tub. Pretending to protect his modesty, he covers his own eyes! The movie isn't a strict comedy, though; far from it. For western comedies, I prefer Dirty Dingus Magee, but El Dorado isn't the worst western I've sat through.",El Dorado
21,Wuchakk,Entertaining 1967 Wayne Western with James Caan and Robert Mitchum,7,12 March 2014,"Released in 1967, Howard Hawks' ""El Dorado"" is an obvious reworking of his 1959 hit ""Rio Bravo,"" both starring John Wayne, yet ""El Dorado"" is not a remake, as some claim.The similarities are undeniable: Both films were shot in Old Tucson, Arizona (substituting for West Texas); both feature the same four general protagonists with John Wayne in the starring role, although he's not the Sheriff in this one; both involve the four protagonists staving off owlhoots intent on freeing a prisoner from the town jail (in this case, played by Edward Asner); and both feature a beautiful saloon-type female. Other than that these are different stories altogether with different characters.Of the two I prefer ""El Dorado."" It's more eventful and less of an Old West soap opera and is therefore more accessible to the average viewer. ""Rio Bravo"", by contrast, is a unique cult Western; it has its own special vibe and the viewer has to adjust to appreciate it. Plus ""Rio Bravo"" is (naturally) more dated compared to ""El Dorado."" It seems like Hawks learned a thing or two from the less traditional Westerns put out in the 60s starting with Brando's outstanding ""One-Eyed Jacks"" in 1961, the obvious precursor to the Spaghetti Western.POSITIVES:""El Dorado"" features a really good old Western tune during the opening credits. - Although ""El Dorado"" primarily takes place in the titular town (actually Old Tucson) there are quite a number of scenes that take place elsewhere, unlike ""Rio Bravo"" where the entire story takes place in the town. - Robert Mitchum is arguably better than Dean Martin as the drunkard; maybe because acting was his primary profession. - James Caan (father of Scott Caan) is superior to Ricky Nelson as the younger sidekick/deputy. Caan has a likable charisma whereas Nelson was okay but bland by comparison. Like the Mitchum/Martin comparison this may be due to the fact that Caan is an actor by profession rather than a singer trying to act. - Charlene Holt is arguably superior to Angie Dickinson. They both have ""Whoa, Mama"" boudoir scenes; compare for yourself. - ""El Dorado"" has two prominent babes whereas ""Rio Bravo"" only had one. Michele Carey stands out as the rancher's shapely daughter Joey. - There's great camaraderie between the main protagonists, particularly Wayne & Caan and Wayne & Mitchum. - Lastly, Arthur Hunnicutt is superior to the annoying Walter Brennan in the similar role. NEGATIVES:The first half is better than the second half wherein the story settles down to events in the town, mostly at the Sheriff's office/jail. - In the second half the characters come off more cartoonish & stagy than real at times. This was a flaw that was being worked out of the Western in the 60s as verified by more reality-based films like ""One-Eyed Jacks"" and ""Duel at Diablo."" This problem was largely removed from Hawks' last (sort of) reworking of ""Rio Bravo,"" 1970's ""Rio Lobo"", but not completely purged. - There's some real eye-rolling dialogue between Cole Thorton (Wayne) and the gunslinger played by Christopher George. They talk about the four (or so) fastest quick draws in the West and wonder who's faster between the two of 'em. It's juvenile & cartoony and, needless to say, totally unrealistic.FINAL WORD: ""El Dorado"" is an entertaining John Wayne Western. It has that special 'something' that makes it click, particularly the first half before it takes the quasi-""Rio Bravo"" route. Robert Mitchum, James Caan, Charlene Holt and Michele Carey are exceptional co-stars.The film runs 126 minutes. GRADE: B",El Dorado

23,JamesHitchcock,Lacking in originality and freshness,6,29 July 2011,"In 1959 Howard Hawks made a Western, ""Rio Bravo"", starring John Wayne and with a screenplay written by Leigh Brackett. The film told the story of how a fearless gunfighter (played by Wayne) defends a town against a gang of ruthless outlaws with the aid of a motley collection of characters, including a drunkard, a semi-comic but brave old man and a young greenhorn.In 1967 Howard Hawks made another Western starring John Wayne and with a screenplay written by Leigh Brackett. The film told the story of how a fearless gunfighter (played by Wayne) defends a town against a gang of ruthless outlaws with the aid of a motley collection of characters, including a drunkard, a semi-comic but brave old man and a young greenhorn.This second film was not, officially, a remake of ""Rio Bravo""; it was, for example, given a new title, ""El Dorado"". There are a number of differences between the films. In ""Rio Bravo"" Wayne played the sheriff of the town. In ""El Dorado"" Wayne's character, Cole Thornton, is not a lawman but a hired gunslinger who is originally hired to fight for the villains; he quits when he discovers just how villainous they are. The town sheriff, J.P. Harrah, is an ally of Thornton but is of limited use as he has become an alcoholic following an unhappy love-affair; in ""Rio Bravo"" it was the out-of-town gunfighter played by Dean Martin who had the drink problem. ""El Dorado"" also contains a sub-plot about how Thornton shoots a young man in self-defence and is then forced to justify himself to the man's family.The similarities between the two films, however, are far from accidental. There are a number of deliberate hints that ""Rio Bravo"" was Hawks's inspiration, such as the fact that both films have a Spanish title, in each case the name of the town. The characters played by Arthur Hunnicutt here and Walter Brennan in the earlier film are very similar to one another. In each case the young greenhorn is named after an American state, Colorado and Mississippi. The surname of Wayne's character may be a reference to another of his earlier films, ""The Quiet Man"", in which he also played a man named Thornton.Seen by itself, ""El Dorado"" is not a bad film. It is attractively shot, competently acted (Robert Mitchum is particularly good as the broken-down alcoholic sheriff Harrah) and has a fast-moving story. It is, however, in some ways a disappointment. In the earlier part of his career, Hawks had been a very varied director. Although he had made some classic westerns, he was not exclusively, or even primarily, a ""western director"" like John Ford. He had worked in a number of genres, generally with great success, also making classic war films, comedies, films noirs and even musicals like ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"". It is therefore disappointing to see him at the end of his career repeating himself by effectively remaking one of his earlier films. This was to be his penultimate movie; his last, made three years later, was ""Rio Lobo"", another film- again with a Spanish title- which can be considered as an unacknowledged remake of ""Rio Bravo"", although with perhaps a greater degree of originality than ""El Dorado"".Perhaps, however, Hawks was not entirely to blame. By the late sixties there were growing signs that the traditional Western had been done to death. So many had been made over the previous few decades that it was becoming increasingly difficult to use the genre to say anything new. (Those who did manage to do so were generally younger ""revisionist"" directors like Sam Peckinpah and Don Siegel who were willing to challenge the received idea of the Old West as one long struggle between the good guys and the bad guys). Even people who have not already seen ""Rio Bravo"" might find ""El Dorado"" lacking in originality and freshness, relying as it does on over-familiar situations and character-types, similar to those found in dozens if not hundreds of other Westerns dating back to the twenties and thirties. It was this lack of freshness which was to be a significant factor in the decline of the Western from the late seventies onwards and from which it has never entirely recovered, despite a modest revival in recent years. 6/10",El Dorado
24,MOscarbradley,"""Rio Bravo"" in all but name",8,2 December 2007,"A superlative Howard Hawks western and one of his most under-valued films perhaps because most critics saw it as something of a rehash of his masterpiece ""Rio Bravo"" with Robert Mitchum in the Dean Martin role, Arthur Hunnicutt in the Walter Brennan part and James Caan standing in for Ricky Nelson. There are certainly many similarities but there are classic sequences as well. Hawks' philosophy seems to be, 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'.This is an old-fashioned movie in the very best of the term somewhat out of sync with most American cinema of the period but there are few directors working in any genre who could master a sequence like the church shoot-out and its immediate aftermath in the saloon with such effectiveness and such an economy of style as Hawks. (The saloon sequence is lifted directly from ""Rio Bravo"", by the way, and some of the dialogue is identical). Not quite a masterpiece, then, but some kind of classic nevertheless.",El Dorado
25,secondtake,"Really smart, complex, well acted, and likable...great stuff!!",9,28 January 2013,"El Dorado (1966)A brilliant movie. I hate to use an overused word, or to seem over the top here. But I really thought Howard Hawks created an arguably better version of ""Rio Bravo"" by doing two key things. One is using two leads who had great mature chemistry together, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. The other is using James Caan as a more convincing and slightly less frivolous sidekick instead of Ricky Nelson in the earlier version. Many people will disagree and that's fine--my point is this is a terrific and somewhat overlooked film.Not that the plots of the two are identical, and you might really blame the director/producer for doing a cheap attempt at a hit, without total originality. The fact is, he succeeds so well you don't mind. Everything is first rate. Even the humor as it gets more and more slapstick and out of keeping with the very serious beginnings of the film is so at ease and warm you like and want the companionship to continue. Hawks and his actors create a setting and a situation that is almost homey, against the odds. And this is in an era when the American Western is all but dead (the great Spaghetti Westerns were now coming out).Critical to the success is the great cinematography by Harold Rosson, who filmed so many classic movies it's hard to know where to start (but start with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Singin' in the Rain""). This is his last film, and he never stops pushing boundaries. There are not only beautiful scenes in the little towns or the shots from the belltower near the end, but some innovative ones. The big theme here is a common one in Westerns--a group of bad guys with guns is out to take something from a group of good common folk. But the solution is notable, and pushed to a limit. That is, the problem is solved through camaraderie and friendship, through trust. And by joining in the cause even if there is no reward, and even though death is not unlikely. It's a story that is oversimplified, of course, but it feels good. Where some Anthony Mann Westerns and the famous Zinnemann ""High Noon"" often have evil or selfish or cowardly people all around the protagonist, here there is only a sense that good will prevail, and by persistence and teamwork.Wayne is at his best here. He's often at his best, I suppose, since he's so consistent, but this shows a strong, smart, wise character that is probably the true Wayne. He's tough and funny and believes in what is right. Period. And I think Hawks knew how to make Wayne look and act his best, and Mitchum seemed to also resonate well. For his part, Mitchum is a terrific derelict sheriff, not overacting, making it reasonable and his character sympathetic. The two have a lot of scenes together and they seem to enjoy themselves without quite breaking into grins on camera.Finally it should be said that the story line is rich and complex. Yes it follows certain common themes and clichés, but it continually twists them up. The first twenty minutes are a harrowing ride of upturned expectations, and the plot really has its teeth sunk into misunderstandings and mistakes that take on huge ramifications. Well written, well paced dialog, well done.One weakness in both ""El Dorado"" and ""Rio Bravo"" is the lead woman in each case, meant to be a ""type"" of course but in ""El Dorado"" coming off as weirdly modern in both sensibility and make-up. I mean cosmetics. Even more glaring is the crazy 1966 hair and eyeliner on a younger woman in the story, who is terrific overall but just seems out of place. You might say the same for Caan, too, but he plays his part with such idiosyncratic verve you accept him as a legitimate oddball.Why not just see ""Rio Bravo"" instead, since it carries similar themes, and Hawks and Wayne as well, and has a superior reputation? Go ahead. ""Rio Bravo"" is a more serious drama, and is terrific. But if you have access to this one (and the streaming Netflix copy is superb), then I'd plunge in. Highly rated, and still underrated.",El Dorado
26,sol-,Was your friend worth it?,7,5 May 2017,"Having turned down a crooked job to avoid having to fight a longtime friend turned sheriff, a gunslinger comes to town to help his sheriff friend out after learning that somebody very violent has accepted the job instead in this popular western drama starring John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. The chemistry between the two stars feels very real every step of the way and as Wayne teams up with James Caan who has recently avenged a friend's death, the movie ultimately becomes a testament to the power and importance of friendships. There is some nice additional drama along these lines as Wayne finds himself needing to sober Mitchum up before helping him to fend of those incoming. Potent as the drama often is though, the film backfires each and every time it tries to inject humour into the story; at its most excruciating, Mitchum is comically whacked over the head when drunk and Caan imitates a Chinese man by scrunching up his face. Fortunately, the humour is quite sporadic and the overall tale remains powerful until the end. Particularly remarkable are the shots of the three protagonists cautiously wandering the shadowy streets at night, alert for possible sniper attacks. Wayne also impressively manages to ride his horse backwards at one point, as if reversing in a car, in order to keep his eyes on various marksmen who might try to shoot him as he departs.",El Dorado

But, Who got the Girl?",9,12 August 2007,"When this 'un come out in '66, it surely musta give some folks the feelin' that it shore musta been what was called one a' them re-runs! They musta had the feeling that they seen it before!Well, all of that talk aside (for now).EL DORADO stands up very well on its own, on several fronts, even. First off, it is a great example of the Western Movie, ""A"" Film, 1st Class. The design of the sets, the overall magnitude of the panoramic views give us a West that is strikingly beautiful, almost as beautiful as the real Western States.In choosing a ""one Best Western""(not the Motel Chain), we would have a truly tough, if not impossible task. The ""Western"" as we know it, may in reality be a ""Genre"" that touches other bases and probably could said to have several ""Sub-Species"", if not out and out ""Hybrids"". Just consider the following.Take these films: EL DORADO, HIGH NOON, DODGE CITY and THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE. Each would, arguably be placed at or near the top of a favourite film list. Yet even though there are some obvious similarities, they have many more differences.Now, EL DORADO has to be seen as a great character study. Indeed, for other than the previously mentioned beautiful sets and the fine action scenes(the gun fightin' as well as the equine choreography), it is the characterizations and the relationships that carry this story. Because it relies so heavily on ""the Duke's"" and ""Rugged Robert's"" previous relationship in the War Between the States, it truly qualifies as a ""Buddy Picture.""Like so many pictures of its type, Director Howard Hawks' EL DORADO boasts of as fine a supporting cast as could be imagined. The play bill includes, but is not limited to mention of the following:Charlene Holt, Paul Fix, Arthur Hunnicut,Michelle Carey(woo,woo,woo, woo!),R.G.Armstrong,Ed Asner, Christopher George,Marina Ghane, Robert Donner, John Gabriel,Johnny Crawford(Mark McCain from ""THE RIFLEMAN""),Adam Roarke, Victoria George, Jim Davis and Chuck Courtney(Lone Ranger's nephew, Dan Reid).Okay, now to address what we have obviously overlooked, until now, that is. Well, is it my imagination, or isn't there any awful lot of similarity to Howard Hawks' RIO BRAVO(1959)? Though most of the credits say not, We have the name of co-writer Leigh Brackett and Director Hawks to link it up. Then of course there's the big guy, John Wayne, he's in both.But the little roll reversal (Wayne's not the Marshall, nor the drunk), and the pairing with Mr. Mitchum, makes it more than worthwhile. Otherwise, Arthur Hunnicutt replaced Walter Brennan's ""Stumpy"" in RIO BRAVO and a non singer*, James Caan, took Rick Nelson's head strong, young gun ""Colorado"" Ryan. This was a good role for the up 'n' coming actor and future Sonny Corleone.While it may not be an out and out remake of RIO BRAVO, it could be called by a term that had more use in the old Mack Sennett and Hal Roach Short Comedy days. It is ""A Rework"", and it means talking a simple, previously done premise, and running with it, making small variations, expanding it and/or using a new gag or a different twist somewhere along the line. In this respect, EL DORADO is certainly that.And it is well worth seeing! Just don't see it on a Double Bill with RIO BRAVO! * No singers here, though RIO BRAVO boasted of crooner Dean Martin as 'Dude' and young Rick Nelson as ""Colorado"".See, there was a singer for the Ladies and one for the Teens!

31,Lechuguilla,"""Ride Boldly Ride""",9,10 April 2014,"As one of the great Westerns of all time, ""El Dorado"" exudes quality throughout. The screenplay by Leigh Brackett is splendid in the development of likable characters. The protagonist is tough, competent, and cantankerous cowboy Cole Thornton (John Wayne), assisted more or less by a flawed town sheriff named J.P. Harrah (Robert Mitchum), a youthful Southern guy out for justified revenge named Mississippi (James Caan), and Bull (Arthur Hunnicutt), an elderly town coot loyal to the sheriff. Characters are easily differentiated with their own quirks and personalities. It's easy to root for them.The script's plot flows well and with a relaxed pace. There's a nice blend of characterization and action. Dialogue is succinct and at times humorous. At one point Bull displays his annoyance with Mississippi's clothes. Bull says: ""(I'm)trying to figure out what that fella's got on his head."" Mississippi replies: ""It's called a hat"". To which Bull responds: ""Well, I'll have to take your word for it"".Parts of Edgar Allan Poe's poem ""Eldorado"" gets recited throughout, mostly by Mississippi, the last verse ending with: ""Ride, boldly ride, the shade replied ... if you seek for Eldorado"". The poem adds philosophy to a story that is otherwise rough and mildly violent.Production design and costumes are detailed, and credible for the era. Those wooden interior floors look exactly like what one would expect in saloons and houses. Casting and acting range from acceptable to very good. I especially like the inclusion of Arthur Hunnicutt, whose demeanor and voice add credibility to the Western setting.My only complaints relate to the lack of originality of the story; and, as with nearly all Westerns, there's a tendency toward character stereotypes, especially among the bad guys.""El Dorado"" is a terrific film in the Western genre.

34,davidmvining,Hang Out by the Watering Hole,7,5 July 2021,"I think that the commercial and critical failure of Red Line 7000 made Howard Hawks simply retreat. He effectively remade his most successful film of the previous twenty years, Rio Bravo, using some of the same cast, another established movie star, and the same basic premise for most of the film. It worked out, providing Hawks with a box office success and a solid film to add to his impressive body of work. This is the more plot driven version of the story in Rio Bravo. Gone are the long scenes of John Wayne and Dean Martin playing off of each other, replaced by more characters and a subplot about water rights that drives the action.John Wayne plays Cole Thorton, a gun for hire, brought on by the local landowner Bart Jason (Ed Asner) for a matter Cole hasn't received any details on. When his old friend, Robert Mitchum's Sheriff J. P. Harrah of El Dorado, lets him in on how Jason is trying to drive the MacDonald family off of their ranch and land in order to effectively steal their water and grow his power in the region, Cole returns his payment to Jason and rides off. As he goes, he passes the MacDonald place, gets shot at by one of the youngest sons of the clan, and kills the boy in self-defense. Returning the body to the MacDonald ranch, the patriarch is understanding, but the young sister, Joey MacDonald (Michele Carey), doesn't take it as well and shoots Cole as he's leaving. Her bullet lodges into his back near his spine, but he bests her in the end and rides away.Six months later, in another town, he meets James Caan's Mississippi, a young man out for revenge against the three men who killed the man who raised him. Visually defined by his unusual hat, Mississippi uses a knife throw to dispatch the last of the three men, ultimately saved from the rest of the group by Cole. Taking the young man under his wing after some reticence, Cole ultimately decides that the best thing for Mississippi is to get him a kind of blunderbuss of a shotgun where he can't miss anything because he can't shoot anything with a pistol. They return to El Dorado together, Cole pursuing the tales of his friend J. P. having become unglued and a drunk because of a woman.Here we see the plot of Rio Bravo sneaking in before finally taking over a bit later. Cole shows up with Mississippi, finding J. P. as hopeless a drunk as Dean Martin in Rio Bravo. He's dirty, sleeping in an unlocked jailcell, and watched over by his deputy Bull (Arthur Hunnicutt). Things have been progressive poorly in El Dorado for the past six months with Jason making further moves on the MacDonald property. There's a chase down the street after a shooting of one of the remaining MacDonald boys where Cole, Mississippi, and a newly sober J. P. go after the three men who did it, ending with a shootout at a church before one runs into a bar. There, J. P. begins to redeem himself by finding the man behind the piano, shooting him, and then arresting Jason for his involvement. This is all almost shot for shot the same as what happens in Rio Bravo, by the way, with some variations.As Cole leads Jason and the rest of the party into the jail, Joey shoots at Jason, missing, and Mississippi grabs her and brings her inside. Aside from a single line of dialogue, the earlier unpleasantness between Joey and Cole goes unmentioned. This is one of the reasons I like this less than Rio Bravo. This is a thread that seems like it should lead to something early but just kind of evaporates. When we first learned that it was Joey, I thought she was trying to kill Cole, to finish the job. It made the most sense based on the amount of screen time dedicated to Joey's antipathy towards Cole rather than Jason. Anyway, with Jason in jail, we now have the same showdown. The bad guy has a gun on him in a cell, and the good guys are going to wait until the US Marshalls arrive. This happens about 90 minutes into the film rather than within the first hour.The finale is a repeat, of course, with variations. Cole gets kidnapped, but the bullet in his back paralyzes him intermittently, leaving the bad guys to trade him for Jason, which ends up working. The bad guys then get a MacDonald boy, and our good guys have to rescue him. It's all perfectly competent stuff.Mitchum is probably the standout of the cast here, playing the showiest of roles in the film as the good man gone drunk and trying to collect himself. I like how Hawks brought the young James Caan along to play Mississippi as well after having led (sort of) Red Line 7000. He's a good presence as the younger, out of his depth support to John Wayne's steady presence as Cole.I find the movie overall as a fun little example of the Western genre. There are more characters here taking up more screen time, so we don't get that easy character driven feel of Rio Bravo. Instead, with more moving parts including a far more detailed introduction to the overall conflict, El Dorado has less time to cover more ground. It's still an entertaining little tale of good versus evil, but I don't get as invested with it as I know I could have.",El Dorado
35,Movie-ManDan,A Pleasantly Delightful Film.,10,12 January 2015,"This was my very first John Wayne movie. I have been a massive movie geek, and realized I had not seen any of his movies until recent. I haven't been trying to avoid anything of his, it's all coincidence. What better way to start off than with cowboy classic, El Dorado? El Dorado is a remake of the Duke's 1959 film, Rio Bravo, co-starring Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson. Remake is the wrong description for this, due to its very different plot and characters. I would consider this to be a ""rehash"" movie. There are similarities in the characters and locations, but that's about it. Rio Bravo is about a sheriff (Wayne) that takes three unlikely men under his wing to stop a band of thugs from helping a criminal escape from prison. El Dorado is about Wayne taking a young man (Caan) under his wing to help his friend (Mitchum) battle a gang of crooks that he would have been a part of. Wayne is the same guy in both movies, but the Mitchum and Caan characters are similar to Martin and Nelson's characters, but more different than anything. I wouldn't say better, just different.What makes El Dorado a great movie right off the bat is that it's not about cowboys on a quest to find a treasure or anything like that. 95% of westerns follow that rule. Because it is about something else, El Dorado is already superior to many. I did mention the story earlier, in a nutshell, but me saying the whole story as simple as possible would be giving away too much. I love movies with stories that cover that much ground. But what makes El Dorado the fun movie that it is that we get to see all these cool and deep characters interacting in very fun ways. There's a few parts in the jail where they are just chilling out. Then action sequences erupt and there's great music behind it all. By only problem? It builds up to a weak ending where the bad guys are supposed to be slayed in a very noteworthy and exciting way. That is the only reason why I gave this 9/10 instead of 10/10. Other than that, this movie was awesome in every way.",El Dorado

Some time later he, his sidekick and an alcoholic sheriff try to fend off some destructive strangers who descend on the town of El Dorado to challenge the family.
This is a warm-hearted entertaining movie of action and humour, directed with a good pace and skilfully by Howard Hawks. The characters are the main thrust of the story with a commanding performance by John Wayne, matched by an amusing worse-for-wear characterisation by Robert Mitchum, and good support from a tricky sidekick played by James Caan. The dialogue is a real plus point with many funny one-liners which make this very watchable, witty, exciting.

Young knife thrower JAMES CAAN joins aging and injured gun for hire JOHN WAYNE and alcoholic sheriff ROBERT MITCHUM to stave off a land grabber who is out to steal a helpless family's land. The film has an interesting structure with hostilities being assumed in the first act with the arrival of WAYNE in the small town to assist the landgrabber only to be talked out of it by old friend MITCHUM. There is a cooling off period when WAYNE is riding and picks up JAMES CAAN as his sidekick. Then the final act where WAYNE arrives in the small town yet again, this time to save alcoholic friend MITCHUM and ends up staying back to fight the landgrabber.WAYNE and MITCHUM are like fathers to each other, watching each others backs. The action scenes aren't much to write home about and includes one silly but funny scene where CAAN imitates a Chinese man to enter a tavern. But there aren't too many dull moments. The film is relentlessly entertaining with lots of cool one liners.ARTHUR HUNNICUTT has nothing on WALTER BRENNAN.

39,bobsgrock,"""Well, we got away with it.""",7,4 July 2009,"Although it is essentially a close remake of Rio Bravo, Howard Hawks' El Dorado is still an interesting and sometimes exciting Western that boasts a very fine cast and some dramatic moments.Here, the iconic John Wayne plays a variation of his Sheriff John T. Chance as hired gunman Cole Thornton who arrives in the downtrodden town of El Dorado to help his drunken sheriff buddy JP Harrah, the version of Dean Martin's character Dude. James Caan plays the Ricky Nelson character, except he cannot shoot a gun and the scenes between Caan and Wayne have a sort of nostalgic and gentlemanly feel that can only come from an old veteran passing off his wisdom to a young up and comer. Robert Mitchum is also good as the drunken and awkward sheriff who battles personal demons as well as Thornton for the affections of Maudie, the woman both of these over-the hill cannot resist.As I said before, this is a remake of Rio Bravo, which I prefer due to the more exciting final shootout and the tender and heartbreaking performance of Dean Martin. Here, most of the characters are not too likable and the romance between Caan and Michele Carey doesn't spark like the one between Wayne and Angie Dickinson in Bravo. If you like Westerns, this is certainly worth a look but they be all that is needed. It is a real shame that Hawks couldn't recreate more magic with the same lead and story, but it is an unfortunate end to an otherwise fantastic career for one of the finest American directors ever.",El Dorado

His introductory scene is incredible and after watching this, it's easy to see why he went on to bigger and better roles.

42,gftbiloxi,An Old Favorite,8,6 May 2005,"Director Howard Hawks and John Wayne would essentially remake the same story three times: first as RIO BRAVO in 1959, then as EL DORADO in 1967, and finally as RIO LOBO in 1970. Caught between the popularity of the first and the dismal failure of the third, EL DORADO is something of a neglected film--but for my money, it is easily the best of the three.The story is the stuff that Western myths are made of. Aging gun-slinger John Wayne is offered a job as hired gun in a range war, but he discovers that acceptance of the job would place him on the wrong side of the law--which in this case is old friend and small town sheriff Robert Mitchum, who has made himself a laughing stock by drinking his way to the bottom of every bottle he can find. Wayne accordingly drifts into town, whips Mitchum into shape, and with the assistance of crotchety deputy Arthur Hunnicutt and youngster James Caan they set about cleaning up the town.Although EL DORADO has a leisurely tone, but it never feels in the least slow--largely due to an unexpectedly witty script that crackles with memorable dialogue (at one point when Mitchum asks Wayne what he's looking at, Wayne responds ""A tin star with a drunk pinned to it"") and unexpected situations (such as Caan's unfortunate way with a shotgun.) The entire cast handles both humor and old-west action with equal skill, and both Wayne and Mitchum offer some the best work of their impressive careers here; James Caan (in his first major success), Arthur Hunnicutt, Charlene Holt, and Michele Carey are equally memorable.There are a great many John Wayne westerns more critically acclaimed than EL DORADO--RED RIVER, THE SEARCHERS, and STAGE COACH to name but a few. And I enjoy them. But EL DORADO is like meeting an old friend whose company you always enjoy. Strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",El Dorado
43,SanteeFats,I like it,9,21 April 2013,"This is one of John Wayne's better movies. He stays within hisabilities and does an excellent job playing what is basically himself. He comes to town to help his old friend who has gone to drink from a broken heart. The marshal eventually gets rehabilitated and every thing takes off from there. Of course there is a lot of action and shooting which is some thing I like about his movies. The scene where the young boy takes a shot at John and is then gut shot by him, commits suicide because of what his father told him, and then John has to take the body to the family is poignant. The end is pretty typical for one of his movies, the good guys win and the bad guys gety killed.",El Dorado
44,Bob-45,As Comfortable As an Old Shoe,8,12 June 2004,"While lacking the visual artistry of his earlier RIO BRAVO (whose first five minutes are some of the best sans dialogue footage ever shot), Howard Hawks improved on his de facto remake, EL DORADO, in many ways. EL DORADO boasts a much more complicated plot (in a shorter running time), a co-star (Mitchum) every bit his equal in the action department, stronger supporting cast and a whole lot more humor. While Charlene Holt, as Wayne's love interest, cannot match Angie Dickenson as an actress, she's prettier, sexier and even stronger (if that's possible). Add Michelle Carey and you have about as much strong, sexy eye candy as any movie could support. Further, not enough can be said about James Caan as a sub for Rick Nelson. While Nelson was a fine singer, he was an embarrassment in RIO BRAVO. Caan more than holds his own alongside Wayne and Mitchum, and that's saying a lot. His character and performance add poetry (both literally and otherwise) to the proceedings. However, what perhaps most sets EL DORADO apart from RIO BRAVO besides its humor, is its villians, Ed Asner and, particularly Christopher George. George's complex, honerable villian is one of the most tragic elements of the movie. And, while Mitchum's alcoholism is a set piece directly stolen from RIO BRAVO, Wayne's paralysis creates genuine pathos and suspense.  It's a handsome package, made more so by glorious Technicolor.However, one wonders why Hawks allowed some of the more inept elements of EL DORADO. The continuity is horrendous in spots. For example, neither Wayne nor Mitchum can seem to decide on which side to use their crutch. Caan's stunt double is clearly seen laying in a shallow ditch which has been clumsily spliced in a scene where Caan is nearly trampled by horses. The actress who plays Polly delivers some of the most horrible line readings I've heard in a feature film. Wayne describes dialogue between him and Johnny Crawford which didn't take place. Hunnicut asks for another gun having emptied his, his request is ignored and he continues firing anyway. You get the idea.Nonetheless, EL DORADO is special. Not a great western, maybe not even that good a western; but, in it's own way EL DORADO is a classic and one of Wayne's most entertaining movies. I give it an ""8"".",El Dorado
45,TOMASBBloodhound,As entertaining as a western could be.,9,20 August 2006,"It's hard not to smile as you watch this film play itself out. There are just too many fine actors and top notch performances contained in this film for it to be anything but outstanding. Howard Hawks knows just how to harness this story and give each actor room enough to strut his stuff.John Wayne plays a hired gun who comes to the aid of a drunken sheriff played to perfection by Robert Mitchum. By Wayne's side is a young man (James Caan) packing a nasty scatter-gun, and also at their disposal is a grizzled Indian fighter deputy (Arthur Hunnicutt). The four do battle with an evil land owner (Ed Asner), his hired gun (Christopher George), and several other gunslingers looking for trouble. A rival family of landowners named the MacDonalds are being pressured by Asner and his cronies. Wayne and Co. take their side, and all hell breaks loose in El Dorado.The film is crisply paced, well-written, and the acting as good as you might expect. Even actors like Caan and Asner who might seem out of their element fit right in and hold their own. Wayne is as watchable as ever. It's a treat just to hear him say the word ""Mississippi"" every time he refers to Caan. Mitchum has the more demanding of the two lead roles, and it's no wonder Wayne wanted that role for himself. The toughest thing our heroes are faced with is sobering him up as he has become the laughing stock of the town he is supposed to protect. Arthur Hunnicutt, as Mitchum's deputy, seems to get a lot of the good lines and more than proves his worth when things get tough. Another person who stands out is Michele Carey who portrays one of the MacDonald clan. I'd never really heard of her before, but the woman is stunningly beautiful. She plays a resourceful woman out to kick some Asner butt.Between the numerous shootouts, there are wonderful scenes where you can tell the stars are just happy to stand together in front of the camera. There are a few scenes that really weren't beaten to death by the genre and actually look original. A shootout involving church bells was something I hadn't seen before, though I'm hardly an expert in western lore. I wouldn't be surprised to find that someone had done it before, but it really worked in this film. Also, it was neat to see Caan blow some of the bad guys to shreds with his shotgun. That was an under-utilized weapon in old western films. His brief impersonation of a Chinaman is bound to offend some, but it's actually quite entertaining.If you love a good western, you must not miss El Dorado. Even if you don't normally watch them, you might also find it more than worth your time.9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",El Dorado

Especially since he plays the same character in every film with only slight variations in The Searchers and The Shootist. Robert Mitchum only adds to the picture and up to the mark with The Duke. The film also includes a young James Caan,who's keeps his own on screen even though he doesn't have the gravitas of the other two and his acting isn't as good as in later films-like The Godfather and Brian's Song.If you're a fan of John Wayne and Robert Mitchum and enjoy westerns, though slightly dated, El Dorado is a film for you.",El Dorado

I think there was a perfect chemistry between the actors in the movie ""Rio Bravo"". Taking into account almost similar plot lines, this is a very reliable remake. Cole Thornton, a gunslinger-for-hire, has found himself in the middle of a conflict between a wealthy rancher, the hardworking McDonald family and law in a fight for water. The local sheriff J. P. Harrah is his friend. Cole, unwilling to fight his friend and to the relief of saloon owner Maudie, has turned down a job with the wealthy and evil rancher.

Several months later, Cole runs into another gunslinger-for-hire named Nelson McLeod and a young greenhorn with a peculiar hat called Mississippi. It seems that his friends and the McDonald family are in great danger. Cole decides to return to El Dorado...Nothing is spectacular in this film, except a very fun relationship between the two big movie stars. The dialogues, that glorifying friendship and responsibility, are comical, gunfight are very exciting and, unfortunately, two romances remain suspended in the air.The scenery is quite cramped. The atmosphere is good. Robert Mitchum as Sheriff J.P. Harrah is very good in the role of a competent sheriff, who became an alcoholic because some women.

It's got direction by Howard Hawks, characters, and people who actually talk to each other in intelligent dialogue and have to think, all set in a beautiful Western locale. John Wayne ably plays a man who has faces several challenges, in this fine screenplay by Leigh Brackett (of ""The Big Sleep"" and ""Rio Bravo"" fame). The challenges have to do with helping his hard-drinking friend, the Sheriff played by Robert Mitchum, combating a gang of badmen headed by powerful Edward Asner, and the fact that he's been shot in the back by mistake and that the pain causes him to be unable to move at inconvenient times. The production has a fine title sung by the great Ed Ames, titles by noted western artist Olaf Weighorst (who also appears as a gunsmith),; and its technical production is truly outstanding in every department Other actors contributing to this near-masterpiece of entertaining film-making include Arthur Hunnicutt, R.G. Armstrong, Christopher George and Charlene Holt in her best screen role ever. Outstanding contributions were made by Nellie Manley and Wally Westmore on hair and makeup, Edith Head on costumes and many others. Altogether a very-satisfying, adult and physically beautiful color western; writer Brackett was asked by Wayne to include the saloon scene from ""Rio Bravo"" in a rewritten version, and it works just as well here; the major change is James Caan as Alan Trehearne, plus the change of cast to Mitchum, Hunnicxuut and Holt, who are all very good indeed.",El Dorado
52,adrianovasconcelos,Reprises Rio Bravo but cannot match it,6,20 April 2020,"RIO BRAVO (1959) had pretty much the same story line: A town under threat from a baddie (Jason Bart, played by Ed Asner) and his horde of villainous henchmen, and a handful of law-abiding citizens trying to uphold the law.The difference is that John Wayne was the sheriff in RIO BRAVO, and now is a deputy. Robert Mitchum steps into the shoes of Dean Martin, as a drunkard - but he is the sheriff. James Caan replaces Ricky Nelson as the young upstart with good values, and Arthur Hunnicutt has the toughest job of all replacing Walter Brennan, who had memorably played Stumpy in the 1959 film.Sadly, Wayne remains as dominant as ever, and fairly maintains the level he displayed in 1959. Mitchum, a better actor than Martin, fails to match the quality of the latter, for one thing because after appearing prim and proper in the early sequences, suggesting that he is a sheriff with a firm hand and authority, he disappears from the film for about 30 min, and when he returns he is a drunkard. In addition, Martin posted his best performance ever in RIO BRAVO, so Mitchum really had his work cut out and he does not quite cut it.James Caan is fine, but he lacks the vitality shown by Ricky Nelson. Again, Caan is the better actor, but his part is not as well written, and his strange ability with the knife instead of the gun, plus the fact that he is on a revenge drive, and has already whacked four men who killed his foster father, does nothing for his character's attractiveness. At least he gets one of the girls, and she is extremely pretty (Michelle Carey), but I got the impression that Caan was just going through the numbers and trying to grab a chance to get into the higher level of the acting world. At leats he was rewarded with the great part of Santino in THE GODFATHER four years later.Mitchum and Caan also lose out to Martin and Nelson because the latter sing a magnificent duet in RIO BRAVO. They just don't sing, which may be a blessing coz I doubt they'd be sufferable.Hunnicutt just does not compare in any way with Walter Brennan's acting quality.The two films were directed by Howard Hawks, who is not quite in the same form here. The final sequences are almost shot for shot a rehash of RIO BRAVO.El Dorado is watchable, especially in these days of Corona Virus confinement, but be warned that you must suspend your disbelief to considerable extents.",El Dorado
53,adrianovasconcelos,Uninspired reprise of RIO BRAVO,6,21 April 2020,"In 1959, Howard Hawks directed RIO BRAVO, the blueprint for EL DORADO. Sadly, Howard Hawks could not improve on his earlier work and his direction was less inspired 8 years later.RIO BRAVO provided the blueprint: John Wayne was the sheriff who arrested the brother of a rich criminal. The latter wanted his brother out of jail, and he placed the town under siege to achieve it. Wayne had only a former pistol wizard, now a drunkard (Martin), an old cripple (Brennan), and a courageous law-abiding youngster (Ricky Nelson).Mitchum replaces Martin. He starts prim, proper and fit as the local sheriff, but then he disappears for about 30 min, and when he returns... you guessed it, he has become a drunkard! Thankfully, good pal, domineering Wayne, lends a hand. Arthur Hunnicutt replaces Walter Brennan's Stumpy, but Brennan had stolen the show in RIO BRAVO, and Hunnicutt simply does not compare.Mitchum, a fine actor, is given a jagged part, and he is no competition for Dean Martin, who played the role of his life in RIO BRAVO.James Caan, a better actor than Ricky Nelson, has a similarly unconvincing part, blowing into town on the back of a revenge drive that has already cost the lives of four men for killing his guardian.Otherwise, it's the same atmosphere, a certain carelessness by the leads strolling the streets at night in spite of knowing that they are targets, and a not particularly convincing villain in Ed Asner.Action stunts are not bad, but unmemorable. Each character gets a couple of scenes to shine with the fists or a weapon of choice, all of which was seen in 1959 and to better effect. Photography offers of the same claustrophobic town and night shots, and the script is a reprint of RIO BRAVO. Dialogue is less inspired, despite some crisp repartee between Wayne and Mitchum.RIO BRAVO was a box office success, and Hawks obviously thought the formula would work again. It does, to some extent - it is not a bad movie and, in light of the current Covid-prompted confinement, it is a way of killing time if you have nothing beter to do. But that's about it.",El Dorado
54,jackasstrange,A well-made and exciting western.,8,14 November 2013,"El Dorado is essentially a remake of the 1959 film Rio Bravo. It has the same plot line of the latter, which is enough reason to consider it in fact a remake, however, it still being considered the second film of a supposed trilogy (Rio Bravo, El Dorado, Rio Lobo). The plot can be a bit simple, but it has very drastic plot turns. In fact,a curiosity about this film would be the fact that every character actions & reaction seems to be a work of the fate in this film. It's just amazing to see how this fate can change the life of almost everyone in the town. In my opinion, i found this film way more interesting and smarter than one of the Wayne's acclaimed best, The Searchers. I think that some will agree that The Searchers is way too outdated. The acting is perhaps very good, highlight to both Robert Mitchum performance as J.P Harrah and to James Caan as Alan Bourdillion Traherne aka Mississipi. John Wayne was the same of ever. The cinematography is one of the highest points of the film. It has few utilization of 'fake scenarios', and it's mostly shot using real environment in Old Tucson and Kanab, Utah.

I think Hawks felt he was in debt with viewers and so he made ""El Dorado"", practically a remake of ""Rio Bravo"".I wouldn't say he got a classic here but this is a better film than ""Rio Bravo"" with more credible situations that make it a more serious western.John Wayne is John Wayne again, but Dean Martin turns into Robert Mitchum, Ricky Nelson into James Caan (thank God!), Angie Dickinson into Charlene Holt, Walter Brennan into Arthur Hannicutt and Claude Akins and John Russaell into Cristopher George and Edward Ashner.Never understood the passion of western fans for ""Rio Bravo"" -in spite of its good atmosphere and excellent music-, but in my opinion ""El Dorado"" is a better product and an acceptable film in the genre.",El Dorado

You would never think that an action packed western would have two world class beauties like Charlene Holt and Michele Carey but Howard Hawks made it all work.

Enter John Wayne with his fast draw and sense of fair play to even the odds in a good but predictable movie. The picture has a talented cast and beautiful vistas of the old west and good action as the two ranchers and their men are locked in a range war with high stakes for the winner. The picture mixes gunslinging with touches of humor along the way to good effect. Robert Mitchum is okay as a drunken sheriff, a departure from his usual tough-guy roles. Arthur Honnicutt and James Caan have nice roles and tomboy Michelle Carey is okay as a wild cowgirl.

59,malvernp,What Unique Accomplishment Links John Wayne To Danny Kaye?,8,21 December 2020,"Can you think of two more different screen performers having anything in common?Think again!Answer: Wayne and Kaye starred in remakes of two different films originally directed by Howard Hawks. Both of the remakes were also directed by Hawks. Wayne was featured in both the original film--Rio Bravo (1959) and its remake--El Dorado (1966). Hawks also directed Ball of Fire (1941) starring Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck. Hawks then remade it as A Song Is Born (1948) with Kaye assuming the Cooper role and Virginia Mayo taking over the Stanwyck part.Producing remakes of previously successful films is as old as the movie industry. But in the modern (sound) period, it was quite rare for the earlier film's director to also helm the remake. However, it has happened--often to less success the second time around. For example, Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much first made in 1934, while a somewhat primitive black and white film, is generally regarded as critically superior to its 1956 more elaborate color version. And These Three, directed by William Wyler in 1936 under the then constraints of the production code, is usually considered to be a better movie than its remake by Wyler retitled The Children's Hour (1962) and released during a more permissive censorship period.Only one other top director in the sound era has repeated Hawks by generating two major successful productions followed by their respective remakes. Frank Capra directed Lady For A Day (1933) and its much criticized remake, A Pocketful Of Miracles (1961). He also created Broadway Bill in 1934 to much acclaim. Capra followed it many years later with Riding High (1950), whose principal success was apparently due to a charming lead performance by Bing Crosby.As for El Dorado, some question its status as a remake of Rio Bravo because of a few differences in casting and characterizations between the two films. In the end, the matter should be put to rest by Hawks himself. In an interview excerpted in the Rio Bravo citation per the 2005 edition of Halliwell's Film Video & DVD Guide, Hawks stated that ""(a)fter we finished (Rio Bravo) we found we could have done it a lot better...and that's why we went ahead and made El Dorado...""El Dorado is particularly special in that it is the only remake I am aware of that repeats the credits for both director AND leading man. It is the next to last film that Hawks made. El Dorado captures the greatness of Hawks and Wayne at somewhere near the peak of their long and distinguished careers. It shows us why they were considered to be among the very best talent ever produced by Hollywood.",El Dorado
60,allyjack,A wonderfully relaxed movie,9,11 August 1999,"A wonderfully relaxed movie - sometimes a bit coarse (such as Caan's Chinaman impression) but on the whole graceful and almost helplessly meaningful - the juxtaposition of Wayne and Mitchum's injuries and obvious human fallibility can t help but push the movie into an exploration of aging and imminent mortality. Maybe that's why there's less sexual banter in this one (Wayne's and Caan's relationships aren't overtly consummated and we never see the myth-like woman who screws Mitchum up) - the focus is on gritting the teeth and carrying out the task at hand; not cowering at the passage of the years, but deeply aware of its implications. The laidback yet unfrivolous tone prevails in scene after scene - right from Mitchum's initial interception of Wayne, the relationships are based in deep mutual knowledge, instinctive professional appreciation and courtesy, and imminent confusion and bemusement (spawning both comedy and anxiety). Mitchum is wonderful but could have been given more to do - Wayne and Caan play off against each other in classic manner. A fine example  of unshowy genre work.",El Dorado

Just proves when you have such outstanding actors such as John Wayne and Robert Mitchum, they measure up even in today's world.

Also, throw in an old wannabe bugler, who plays like a six year old who has never had a lesson and this movie is a laugh riot.Standard Western fare, but a good story. Some rich fellow wants to buy out water rights on someone's ranch and is willing to hire professional killers to do it. He even approached Cole Thornton (John Wayne) who turned him down after he found out from his old friend the sheriff (Robert Mitchum) what he would be doing. For a little suspense, one of the ranchers shoots Thornton in the back after he accidentally kills one of her brothers, and Cole is subject to bouts of pain spasms and paralysis in his right side that comes and goes to add a little suspense to the mix. Will Cole's paralysis seize on him in the middle of the big gun battle? See the movie and find out. (No spoilers this time, folks. Sorry.)

But the sets were great, dialog was spot on, and it didn't hurt to have a few pretty women in the cast.I'm not sure I could write a spoiler for this movie. I may have watched this movie five or six times but there is so much plain cowboy to this movie that I never paid much attention to the story line.This is classic John Wayne. He is wise, a great shot, seems to know everybody, and is respected by the other characters. Robert Mitchum can't help but bring some comedy into any role, even when he's trying to be serious. I never actually believed Mitchum was a great actor, but it didn't matter. He was so likable and steady he was a great addition to any movie. What Mitchum brought to the movies was... Mitchum.This may be one of the best James Caan roles ever. He portrays a young cowboy with a chip on his shoulder and is perfect in the role.Charlene Holt in that lingerie getup - wow. All she had to do was stand there.Paul Fix must have been in 200 movies. Such a recognizable face and perfect for cowboy movies. He had a role in the original Battlestar Galactica too. He added character to every role he played.Michele Carey as the cute young reckless daughter.The list of well known character actors goes on and on in this movie and each had a chance to strut their stuff.You see the story line really doesn't matter that much.

Much has been made of the fact that this is the remake of Rio Bravo, and as we love Rio Bravo so much, well, El Dorado can't really be that good, it's just an imitation...Wrong, wrong, wrong.Yes, you can go through different aspects of the two films - the characterisation, the complexities of the situation, the stylistics of Hawks' direction in different parts of the films - but ultimately one is left with the conclusion that Hawks and Leigh Brackett realised that they had come close to perfection with the earlier film and, in El Dorado, they wanted to go that extra mile and achieve it. And that is what, in my view, they have done.The have added to Rio Bravo - the whole sub-plot of the shooting of the McDonald boy, the character of Mississippi is massively more complex than that of the Ricky Nelson character in Rio Bravo, and, most of all they have added the humour of age. El Dorado, great, almost Shakespearean drama that it is, is laugh out loud funny as well... ""Did you hit him?""... ""Well, he was limping when he left."" ... ""He was limping when he came in!!!"".Above all, what is in El Dorado but missing in Rio Bravo is the sense of a great wisdom underpinning the drama. El Dorado is a film of old age and frailty, but along with frailty in old age comes wisdom, and the wisdom of this film is truly magnificent. It is foreshadowed in the grandeur of Olag Weighorst's paintings behind the opening credits and just keeps getting better and better with every scene until the final euphoric walk along the Main Street by Wayne and Mitchum in the final scene. The perfection makes me weep even to think of it.Forget that it is a John Wayne movie. Forget that it is a western. Forget, even, that it is a work of cinema.

One wishes it could have happened again.The Duke plays Cole Thorton, a gunman, who has been hired by a land baron in Texas to assist in taking over some much-needed water land, and, if necessary, put an end to interference that the sheriff, played by Mitchum, would offer.  Unbeknownst to the land baron, Thorton and J.P.Harrah are friends from the war, and Thorton decides to ride away from the job.A few months later, Thorton returns to El Dorado to warn Harrah that a new threat will be coming to the town, and he finds that the sheriff has become the town drunk, due to a fouled-up romance.  Thorton now has to help J. P. get his skill back, prevent the range war from busting out, while keeping a young sidekick, Mississippi, played by James Caan, alive and healthy.  There is also a good performance turned in by Arthur Hunnicutt, as Bull, J.P.'s deputy who stands by the sheriff, even in times of drunken sprees.There are some similar elements to other Wayne films, notably ""Rio Bravo"" and ""Rio Lobo"", but the chance to watch two big stars work off each other, makes this one easy to take.",El Dorado

El Dorado is one of the best. The movie is closely related to Rio Bravo That is his earlier direction.This movie is little different but as good as Rio Bravo. I think El Dorado contains more humor and suitably action. Especially some scenes are very funny like the scene where shefiff played by Mitchum drinks a very bad tasting drink to solve his alcohol problem. Plot is suitably simple. In the town of El Dorado sheriff with his helpers fights against gun men hired by local rancher Bart Jason (played by Edward Asner). There are three gunfighters with sheriff: his old friend Cole Thornton (played by John Wayne), an old indian fighter Bull and poorly shooting gambler Mississippi. There is no bad actors in El Dorado. Best of them are Mitchum, Wayne, Caan and Asner. Movie has many good scenes along with humor.

Charlene Holt plays well the part of Wayne's lover, Arthur Hunnicutt is the only one who could play the part of the rough, good-ole boy deputy sheriff. James Caan long before he'd ever be playing the part of ""The Godfather""s son, provided both seriousness and comedy. Ed Asner was a mean rancher, and Chris George played the part of the crooked gunman. Johnny Crawford, who had been Mark on ""The Rifleman"" is good as a young cowboy in this.In the story, by accident Crawford is shot by Wayne, which causes the latter to get away from it all. After some adventure, Wayne returns to El Dorado where he had been in the first. He comes back to a town run by Asner and some of his henchmen. To add salt to the sore, Robert Mitchum is the sherriff who has been drunk for several months.

The story is about reunion of two old friends - a sheriff and a gunfighter who helps a rancher family to fight its rival. Plot is not any unique but the fine screenplay and balanced characters makes it worthy. The chief attraction of the film remains the presence of Wayne and Mitchum. John Wayne was in his usual best. No comment about him is required when it comes a western. At first, I found Robert Mitchum out of shape but later he made sense as an alcoholic sheriff. His character gives some good laughs. Apart from that I found many characters closely resembling the ones in Rio Bravo.Anyway, movie maintains its own identity somehow with a fine antagonist.

This lodges a bullet in his back which flares up causing partial paralysis for short times. Robert Mitchum plays a drunken sheriff, and has a really good time doing it. Arthur Hunnicut is the comical sidekick who likes to play his old Civil War bugle. In one of his first big roles, James Caan is ""Mississippi"", a youngster who can't shoot a lick, but is handy with a knife, he's terrific. These are the good guys. Ed Asner is the chief villain, Christopher George is the Duke's opposite number, the bad guy's hired gun. R G Armstrong turns in another solid performance as the father of the boy Cole shot and killed, but who understands it was an accident.

After all, Wayne was nearing the end of his reign as the King of Westerns and Mitchum was looking extremely frail. To be fair, it is evident that both men are looking a little tired in the movie, Mitchum especially, although that is the role he is playing. Today though, this movie stands up as a very enjoyable western with some great dialogue. The formula for the western is always the same as everyone knows. Landowner has trouble, help comes. A reluctant/drunk sherriff is needed but refuses until help in the shape of an old friend arrives. It matters not though as what makes the film is the class and prescence of the actors as well as the dialogue. As mentioned, the dialogue is superb throughout.

As always, it's John Wayne who calls the shots. Known as the quickest draw in the land, Cole Thorton, played by Wayne, is hired by a local villain and land owner Bart Jason who seeks his rival neighbor's precious water supply. The other star of of El Dorado is the town Sheriff and Cole's old friend J.P. Harrah played by Robert Mitchum. Also known as a gunslinger, and most likely a former outlaw himself, Harrah advises Thorton to turn down the job proposed to him as the Sheriff reveals the true story behind the neighborly feud. Always playing it straight, Hawks deliver's his classic nuance of good guy bad guy as Wayne and a drunken disheveled Mitchum unite with a band of misfits to tackle the cunning bandits that have been employed by the ruthless Bart Jason, as all hell breaks loose in El Dorado. Although Wayne and Mitchum are the leading men, it's the supporting cast that make El Dorado the timeless movie it is, with ragtag heroes James Caan and Arthur Hunnicutt serving up and dishing out the larakin charm that Howard Hawks movies are known for.

John Wayne plays his usual solid role, but it is the surrounding cast  and Howard Hawks' direction which really make this an excellent and very entertaining movie. Mitchum is fantastic as the washed up sheriff, and Arthur Hunnicutt is irreplaceable as the ""ol injun fighter"" Bull. James Caan and his sawed-off shotgun are also very good. If there is a weakness in the movie, it would be the casting of Christopher George as a ""feared"" gunslinger (oh, come on), but even George can't bring down this well-written gem. My favorite scenes are not those with lots of action, but rather those that feature great jailhouse banter between the main characters. If your idea of a great western is the Wild Bunch, this might be a little too tame for you. But if you don't mind the idea of decent action mixed with great dialogue, this is a must see.

86,buddyboy28,"More than just a re-working of Rio Bravo, a classic in it's own right",9,23 October 2013,"Six years after the success of Rio Bravo, director Howard Hawks re-worked elements of the plot for another great western with The Duke. The comparisons between the two films are in inevitable but this doesn't actually start to even resemble the previous film until around the halfway mark and by then it's already pulled you into it's story and warmed you to it's characters that it doesn't matter anyway. Personally I love both films but if I was forced to choose I'd probably say this was the superior film. I felt that Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson were too lightweight in Rio Bravo, whereas Robert Mitchum and James Caan here are perfectly cast and bring more to the table. I also think it works better to have an actual sheriff be the drunk (in this case Robert Mitchum in the role) rather than a deputy, and to have his friends try and help him get back on his feet and regain his dignity and self respect. But it's just a matter of opinion.Mitchum is fantastic in this as the drunken friend of gunslinger John Wayne. I'm not usually a fan of his but he really delivers the goods here. He's funny, pitiful and gutsy throughout. One of the best scenes shows him going into the saloon to get a bottle of whiskey and the townsfolk are laughing at him. It's a brilliant moment. He's been living in his own little bubble for months and it takes this for him to wake up and realise how far he's sunk. The way he walks out holding his bottle in such a pathetic manner and tries to keep it together when he sees his friend John Wayne looking at how terrible he looks, is a great piece of acting. Not a single word spoken from him. Equally good is the scene where he later goes back to the saloon and shows the bad guys and the residents he's still got what it takes. He really does put his own stamp all over this performance.And The Duke is The Duke. What more has to be said. By this time these roles just fit him like a glove but he has a really good part here to sink his teeth into rather than just been the typical hero. Near the beginning of the film he shoots a teenage boy in self defence, which results in the boy killing himself. This is a great sequence, where Wayne shows off just in his expression how guilty he feels. It also gives him a personal reason to get involved in helping out the boy's family later on.In many ways this is a funnier film than Rio Bravo but at the same time it's also a darker film in other ways and this is one such moment. John Wayne been responsible for a boy's death is certainly not something that would happen often in his films.James Caan plays a young cardsharp nicknamed Mississippi who befriends Wayne and Arthur Hunnicut plays Bull, an ex-Indian fighter turned deputy to Mitchum's sheriff. The film is really the Wayne and Mitchum show but these guys also have their moments and fit in nicely. The camaraderie between the four of them as they hole up in the sheriff's office, and their banter during the shootouts is consistently funny.Charlene Holt and Michelle Carey are both suitably sexy and provide some eye candy to balance out the male dominant proceedings, and Christopher George makes a memorable villain has a gunslinger with a moral code which makes a refreshing change in a traditional western.When it comes to the good guys vs bad guys, I think it works well if the good guys are outnumbered or are lacking in their skills to make them underdogs that you can really root for. Well in this case, these heroes are both outnumbered and lacking. J.P's struggling with his alcoholism, Bull is getting on in years, and Mississippi can't shoot straight. In fact his shooting's so bad he carries a shotgun instead of a pistol and then he's not much better. And Wayne suffers with periodic paralysis from a bullet that is lodged near his spine. So they have to make up for it with guts. Every time I watch this film I like it even more. They are just a great bunch of characters to hang out with.Hawks certainly knew how to make a great western and here he delivers again. From the great opening theme song right through to the climax, this is a joy for it's entire 2 hour running time. Despite the similarities it doesn't belong in Rio Bravo's shadow in my view, it deserves to be regarded as classic in it's own right.",El Dorado
87,blindau52,Favorite oater of all time,9,26 December 2004,"I must have seen it 10 to 20 times as a young teenager when it first came out and saw it again just yesterday on AMC (Christmas Day). I don't like John Wayne and I'm not very big on Westerns but I can honestly say this really is my favorite oater. ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" and ""Silverado"" run a close second/third. This features everything people like to see in a Western with late-1960s campiness thrown into the mix. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously. James Caan in a pre-Sonny Corleone role steals the show as shotgun-toting Mississippi. I know his disguise as a Chinese coolie would make Asians madder as hell today, but we ought to cut that pre-PC scene some slack. Amazing to see a relatively unknown Ed Asner and ""Rat Patrol"" star Christopher George in supporting roles as bad guys.",El Dorado

My father took me, my brothers and a couple of other neighborhood kids to see this. It was a great, old-fashioned western then and it still looks good today. The Duke and Mitchem make a great pair. The supporting cast, especially James Caan, Ed Asner and the great character actor Arthur Honeycutt, do a great job creating characters that are memorable. Even the bit players chip in with great performances. Wayne and Mitchem let each of the performers do their job and Howard Hawks shows that he knows how to direct a western. Even though my father has passed away, just watching this film allows me to connect with him and his favorite actor, John Wayne. And it doesn't hurt that this is a top-notch, but somewhat forgotten, classic western.",El Dorado
89,ponyiq,"Hawkes, Wayne and staying gold",8,12 August 2006,"I love John Wayne. I am 35 and my daughter is 4. There are very few westerns of modern time, or non-animated movies for that matter, that I can allow my daughter to watch. Time and again though I can allow her to watch john Wayne movies.. she and I share the favorites. We both dearly love El Dorado, Big Jake, Hatari and the Searchers Anyway, what it comes down to is this, Eldorado is a remake of Rio Lobo, but that is OK. When you put the greats on the screen together, the fact that hawkes movies are always epic in proportion, always seem larger than life, well it makes for a good movie. I love some modern movies, don't get me wrong, but when it comes down to it, movies from years gone by did not have to rely on car chases, blood, gore, and sex scenes.. there was plenty of romance, plenty of play between the characters, you could feel the sadness, you could feel the pain, without having to see it all. It was a time that allowed more imagination, and I can assure you that imagination is often far greater in depth than what a filmmaker can put on the screen. I think that is part of the draw of John Wayne, Robert mitchum and some of the other greats of that era.. there films were larger than life, without giving up all the details, your mind has to fill in the blanks.. It is a great film, not the greatest but it is a wonderful film and i can let my 4 year old watch it, she is the next generation of John Wayne lover. Her favorites are big Jake and hatari, but this one is very close in her list of favorites. I am writing this because while flicking through the channels looking for something, it was on, and she recognized it right off the bat. It also gave us another opportunity to learn something knew. She is finally old enough to ask about the poem early on, so we looked it up and now it is written on her wall, can she read it, no, but the movie sparked an interest, just as it sparked an interest learning about other breeds of horses, we have horses and we ride, but I had not been able to get her interested in other breeds, but John Wayne on the big appaloosa and caan on the palomino got her asking about their colors and what kind of horses. We have done the same thing with hatari, there are not many American 4 year olds that have a base knowledge of where it is located, the mountain that is there, the Serengeti, the types of animals, as in we looked up each of the animals that they caught. Another thing, there is a strong female character that is so common in hawkes films. I mean he always has a strong woman, sometimes more than one, that is all woman, but still strong.

90,RNDorrell,"Ride, Boldly Ride, to the End of the Rainbow ...",8,21 June 2021,"Rio Bravo (1959) was the untested version of this story, but it was just sort of weird, with Dean Martin as the penitent drunk, ultimately a good guy. Ricky Nelson played the role later inhabited by the much, much better James Caan, in the first remake, this film. But Nelson could not act, he was cast based on his then-musical success, he booted every scene in Bravo, every single opportunity, he just destroyed. The 1966 version, this one, was by far the correct Hawks elixir for telling this story: of a drunken sheriff reluctantly backed up by an old friend, and his younger sidekick, an an aging colorful rifleman, against tall odds. Hawks' final take on essentially the same story, 1970's Rio Lobo, was.an attempt to tell the tale more darkly, but it didn't much succeed, except to keep padding the Duke's wallet. This version, the middle son of the trilogy, is the One. Blessed by timing, cinematography, chemistry among the excellent cast (even the two doctors inject interest into the story line), some appealing and meaningful female costars, a subtle and sly subtext of cynical humor in the script (beautifully channeled by Mitchum, here, and assisted by Wayne and Arthur Hunnicutt, as Bull), it all worked. Topped off with a great western song as opening theme. One criticism: only at the very end, did anybody among the band of bad guys either 1) think about posting a back door guard, or 2) show the slightest awareness about the tactical importance of denying easy exits/entrances from a back door, among the good guts in the cast. Seriously. Put a sniper on their back door, will ya?",El Dorado
91,davebeedon,Being with old friends,9,19 December 2004,"What makes a movie attractive? For me and ""El Dorado,"" the attraction is being with old friends. That's how I look at the characters in this movie. Having seen the film several times, I'm so familiar with the plot and the characters that every new viewing is like visiting people I know and like.So what if ""El Dorado"" is based on, modeled after, lifted from, or a copy of, ""Rio Bravo""? I let the movie stand on its own. Yes, there are weaknesses: poor continuity, characters that seem out of place or poorly developed, and a scene that today would be considered politically incorrect. What movie doesn't have flaws? One aspect of the film that impressed me is the notion of ""professional courtesy"" as espoused by the bad gunman Nelse McLeod, played by Christopher George. The character is a thinking man's bad guy, one who is smart enough to know his limitations and respect another man's ability, even if (especially if?) that man is his enemy. McLeod's ability to look beyond the job at hand reminds me of the philosophical killer in ""Pulp Fiction."" It's akin to the respect that opposing military officers have of each other in war.Every time I see ""El Dorado"" I enjoy it. Part of my enjoyment comes from thinking about what I was doing when this movie was made (1965-6). While I struggled with my first year of college, many film industry people were making this film, doing location shooting in the southwest.I would love to visit certain places that were used: the stream crossing where Johnny Crawford (Luke MacDonald) and John Wayne (Cole Thornton) were shot; the place where Wayne fell off his horse after suffering a muscle spasm; the ranches of Bart Jason (Ed Asner) and Kevin MacDonald (R. G. Armstrong). I'd love to walk through the gate of the MacDonald ranch, approach the house, and say, ""MacDonald, Kevin MacDonald, come out and get your boy."" I wouldn't mind exploring the movie set used for the town, either.After watching the film last night, I researched the poem ""El Dorado"" and discovered it was written by Edgar Allen Poe. Seeing this movie broadened my horizons a bit.",El Dorado
92,mmmopens,Close to perfection...,10,30 September 2000,"Though I would never consider this the greatest film ever made - it hasn't the purity of Bresson, the ambition of Welles or the humanity of Renoir, it is,  as I write in spite of being regarded by many as an inferior remake of 'Rio Bravo', my 'favourite' film of the maybe 10,000 I have seen over the last 35 years. The word that I would use to characterise it is 'wisdom'. This film (along with Dreyer's Gertrud from the same era) shows how a great director in the twilight of his career can monumentalise a simple theme with the wisdom of age. The theme of the film is much more than Hawks' normal 'male love story'. But the thematic side of the film is so multi-faceted that it it almost giddying in its complexity. Loyalty, greed, the cruelty of fate, and the relationship between youth and experience are all explored in a rich situation that grows more profound at every viewing.This brilliant, brilliant film is, amazingly, all the greater by being shot through with humour. It is enlivened by unforgettable minor characters - Bull, Mississippi - enhanced by Nelson Riddle's heroic soundtrack - but, above all monumentalised by the playing of Wayne and Mitchum, and Hawks' matchless mise en scene. If you don't see it you are missing one of life's finest experiences.",El Dorado
93,mmmopens,Crushingly wonderful (slight spoilers),10,5 October 2003,"As someone who has run a cultural cinema for over thirty years and programmed thousands of great films from the whole history of the cinema from Lumiere Bros forwards, I am often asked what I regard as the greatest film ever made. El Dorado is NOT the greatest film ever made (though it deserves consideration), but it IS my favourite of the thousands and thousands of films that I have seen.Why is this?Firstly, it is heroic. It announces this in the credit sequence of Olag Wieghorst's paintings of the old west, and delivers throughout its length right up to the final adrenalin gushing walk of the two old and failing gunfighters along the street in a town that they have made fit to live in.Secondly, it is sensationally subtle in its mise en scene. Look at the scene where the crippled Cole Thornton is exchanged for Bart Jason. After the exchange has been made, Cole is seen on the right hand side of the screen lit in warm hues by the table lamp. JP and Bull, who made the exchange, on the other hand are coolly lit (cool meaning not hot, please) by the greenish oil lamp. I cannot think of a more subtle use of lighting to express emotional relationships in all cinema.Camera and character movement within  the frame are also brought to a new high. Look at the shot when Bull announces that Cole is leaving. It follows naturally from his (Bull's) spectacular entrance and results in a two-shot with Maudie whom we know loves Cole... then Bull, having, unknowingly, dropped the bombshell of Cole's departure moves out of frame to the right and the camera moves just far enough to put Maudie centre frame as we see the pain that the news gives her... Thirdly, it integrates its humour throughout the long and complex drama. Structurally the use of Bull and Mississippi as foils for JP and Cole is a complete masterstroke.Finally it is one of the most emotionally satisfying films I can remember. I weep in the closing moments every time I see it because I realise that I am about to lose these wonderful, wonderful characters who have transported me into a kind of heaven for the past two hours.So who do we mainly thank for this most magnificent film?I really must read Harry Brown's novel from which the screenplay was adapted... but I do know that as far as I am concerned Leigh Brackett is the greatest female script-writer - indeed greatest female film artist behind the camera - and not just because of this work. And when she worked with Howard Hawks glory almost invariably followed.I've already mentioned Olaf Wieghorst's paintings, which are also monumentalised by the title song - praise be to Nelson Riddle and John Gabriel (who plays Pedro) - which I would feel honoured to have played at my funeral.Then there is the small matter of John Wayne and Robert Mitchum - two towering stars who had by then become great actors, and magnificently naturalistic cinematography by Harold Rosson whose career spanned to almost 150 films as cinematographer with credits including Docks of New York, The Wizard of Oz, Singin' in the Rain and this, his last film, into which he put all of his love and artistry.Which brings us to Howard Hawks, the most unpretentious artist of the cinema, and one of its greatest. I know this film is a kind of remake of Rio Bravo, and he went on to do it again with Rio Lobo, but for me, this is his last full work - his health was failing on the shoot of Rio Lobo. There is something special in the last works of (some)truly great directors ... look at Gertrud, or Family Plot, or The Dead. It as though they are saying to us... 'OK... I'd like to do it over a dozen or so films, but I'm going to show you the real cinema in just one, because I might not get another chance....' So just the same as in Family Plot were Hitchcock's generosity and artistry come together in the biggest slice of cake he ever delivered, here Hawks gives us a kind of sublime perfection of cinematic structure and expression.One film to a desert island?This is it...",El Dorado

95,dgcrow,"Great Remake of ""Rio Bravo""",9,11 February 2003,"Westerns don't get any better than this. The cast, especially Mitchum, Caan, Hunnicutt and George, is outstanding. Wayne, of course, gives his usual solid performance. Two components especially set this movie apart. One is the laconic, humorous script that sometimes resembles some sort of off the wall poetry. It also manages to include some subtle, good-natured send-ups of typical situations found in dozens of other westerns, while restoring and uplifting the genre at the same time. The other is the beautifully understated score by the great Nelson Riddle.Is this movie better than ""Rio Bravo""? It has more humor, and Caan is certainly superior to the clueless Ricky Nelson. Mitchum is as good as Dean Martin, although Martin's character, a little more vulnerable, perhaps has greater appeal. Both movies demonstrate the distinctive style of Howard Hawks, and both clearly deserve the designation of ""classic"".",El Dorado
96,nickgodfrey,Still better than the original.....,10,9 July 2021,"Unofficial sequel to the 1959 classic Rio Bravo, this is my personal favourite of the two films. It's a tighter, leaner and less bloated version and everything just clicks.It's the standard outnumbered and outgunned good guys desperately trying to hold off the big guns of the bad guys, with a couple of women getting in the way for good measure.Big John is Cole Thornton, famed gunslinger for hire, who is offered a job by shady land baron Bart Jason (Ed Asner). On the advice of his old buddy, sheriff of El Dorado JP Harrah (Robert Mitchum) Cole turns the job down, forcing Jason to hire himself dangerous and notorious gunfighter Nelse Macleod (Christopher George).Enter young stranger Mississippi (James Caan) , who has been tracking the 4th of Macleod's gunman (he's already taken care of the other 3). He despatches the gunman in a great scene, and is then aided by the Duke.As it turns out JP the sheriff has hit the skids big time after a rough deal with a female, and now he's the town drunk and laughingstock. Cole, Mississippi and old Indian hunter Bull, all band together in the jail around JP as they desperately try to keep Asners character in jail until the Marshall arrives.The whole thing is a rollicking good time adventure. Comfortable and fun to be among. Wonderful Harold Rossen photography as well, particularly the evening scenes of the town with the soft glow of candles and torches lighting the buildings.Great cast as well with Mitchum taking the hardest role: his JP is at turns pathetic and heroic and you really route for him, especially when he returns to the saloon to take revenge on those who mocked him.The story is pretty much identical to Rio Bravo but I think it works better because of the banter between Wayne, Mitchum and newcomer Caan who is great as the laid-back Mississippi - useless with a gun but big-hearted, brave and deadly with a knife. Caan for me makes the film and he's a much better character than Ricky Nelson in Rio Bravo.Another mention I feel should go to Christopher George as the deadly Macleod. His character is constantly smiling, big scar down his face and he brings some charismatic menace to the proceedings.Great western.",El Dorado
97,johnphilo1,Absolute Drek,3,9 January 2005,"John Wayne's and Howard Hawks' careers, while legendary, are characterized by extreme highs and extreme lows (like heavy metal and country music). This movie is an extreme low, and (like bad heavy metal and bad country music) borders on self-parody. Awful script, terrible characters, poor story, atrocious sets, horribly horribly bad costumes and makeup, I could go on for days. John Wayne acts to his formula and seems to go through the motions mailing in a performance, James Caan is farcical though it seems more his character's fault rather than his work. His Chinese man scene is poorly imagined, poorly executed, and embarrassing on every level. Ditto the poorly executed scene where Caan dives under the horses. Ed Asner's character is never developed. The women characters are ridiculous. However, Robert Mitchum and Arthur Hunnicutt do great jobs, Christopher George does fine, ditto R.G. Armstrong, but it all has the feel of a ship sinking, the ship being Hollywood's studio system and the old dinosaurs made great during its heyday. Hollywood had not yet found a way forward and continued to churn out crap such as this to validate its existence. The story is so bad, we could care less whether the bad guys or the good guys win this fight, its not much of a fight. There never is any real doubt that the bad guys are going to lose this one, they are completely witless throughout. Despite some very contrived impediments to make the good guys appear vulnerable on the surface, at no time do we believe that any of them are coming out of this thing with more than a scratch and a few stories to tell their buddies.

102,gawlinskie,The Magnificent Rifleman,9,19 March 2007,"In El Dorado's (1966) opening scenes where sheriff J. P. Harrah (Robert Mitchum) confronts Cole Thornton (John Wayne) a point is made about the sheriff's rifle (which plays an important role in the thrilling climax). This rifle looks a lot like the rifle Lucas McCain (Chuck Connors) used in the TV series The Rifleman (1958  1963).In El Dorado, Cole Thornton is attacked by Luke MacDonald (Johnny Crawford). I don't know if this was planned, but the actor who played Luke MacDonald also played Lucas McCain's son in The Rifleman. I hadn't recognized Crawford. He plays his small role well. This brief shootout starts a chain of events that leads to the Due using the modified winchester at the end of the movie.The scene where Alan Bourdillion Traherne (James Caan) armed with only a knife, kills a gunslinger reminds me of the Magnificent Seven (1960) when Britt (James Coburn) does the same thing. This early Caan movie shows his acting skills that gave him his long and fruitful career.This is a very solid western. There is a lot of action, revenge, loyalty, fair play, and humor  The story line makes sense. There is no wasted activity it is a tight plot.

I must have watched it 40 or so times by the age of 9, and it's nice to know now that I had good taste at that age!  Howard Hawks, whose simple storytelling approach has left him, IMHO, the most underrated director in history, here gives us a third classic Western to follow Red River (1948) and Rio Bravo (1959).  Much has been made of this movie's similarities to Rio Bravo, and it is usually overlooked as a result. However, James Caan makes a better green kid type; Robert Mitchum is easily a match for Dean Martin (supercool Dino may have been, but this is Mitchum we're talking about here!); John Wayne is as good here as he was in Rio Bravo; which only leaves Arthur Hunnicutt as the weak link when compared to that greatest of all supporting actors, Mr. Walter Brennan.
Saying one of the two movies is better than the other is like comparing Schindler's List to Jaws - both are brilliant and don't deserve to be dismissed as ""second-best"".  This movie is very funny, action-packed, superbly acted, has a great opening song and features the classic Hawks themes of male bonding with the token feisty girl threatening the men.  You even get a moment or two of slapstick.One quick word about Hawks - he made my three favourite US Westerns of all time, the best film noir (The Big Sleep (1946)), great melodramas (Only Angels Have Wings (1939), To Have And Have Not (1944)), and the funniest movie I've ever seen (Bringing Up Baby (1938)).  The Thing From Another World (1951) produced by Hawks and directed by his editor Christian Nyby, has Hawks' fingerprints all over it, and is a terrific sci-fi movie.  Air Force (1943) is a great flag-waving war movie, and he even managed to crack the crime genre with Scarface (1932).  Anyhoo, I hope you'll check some of these little-seen Hawks movies out if you enjoyed El Dorado.  A definite 10/10.",El Dorado
106,acctreg,Reasons to watch El Dorado if you haven't already,7,12 May 2013,"I decided to watch El Dorado because movie critic Roger Ebert listed it on his website as the 15th best movie for 1967. This was my first John Wayne movie to watch from beginning to end, and I'm far from being a big fan of the 'western' movie genre, only because I hadn't watched any western movies in their entirety until now. This was typical 'good guys vs. the bad guys.' If like me you're not already a John Wayne or 'western' fan, I'll offer up a few reasons why it might be worth investing 2 hours of your time. 1) From a production standpoint, I loved all the outdoor night time scenes in and around the little town. Whoever worked on the lighting did a great job. They made it look like the characters were operating under a full moon each night. 2) Actress Charlene Holt as Maude. She's as pretty a woman as I've ever seen, period. 3) I watched El Dorado just after watching The Godfather for the first time. Far from an Academy Award performance, this was the movie that purportedly put James Caan on the map. Obviously, it's a totally different kind of role from the Godfather, but he seems to do an adequate job with whatever is asked of him. 4) If you like 'shoot 'em ups,' whether they're 'western' movies or not, there are plenty of bullets flying around.What's NOT a reason to watch? Well, how about the acting ability (or lack thereof) of Robert Mitchum. Line delivery is not his forte. This was my first Robert Mitchum movie, and he's not someone I'd go out of my way to see again. I'd sooner seek out some Charlene Holt eye candy :) Enjoy!",El Dorado

That in itself is reason enough to watch it. The fact that some aspects are copied from other Howard Hawks films makes no difference at all. It's a lovely grand and terrific movie that stands on it's own merits. One would expect The Duke and Bob Mitchum to shine, but the supporting cast is equally entertaining. James Caan in his first big role is almost too good to be true, and his sawed off shotgun blasts excitement into every scene that he fires it, but Arthur Hunnicut as Bull, in my opinion, steals the movie. His suggestion on how best to sober a man up is by a ""...bunch of howlin' indians out for hair..."" or when Mississippi is mixing up an anti-drinking concoction, he's saying ""...add some oil of cloves, or is it...no wait, it's crotin oil!"" and Bull says, ""CROTIN OIL! Well I'll be a suck egg mule!"" I mean, that's priceless. These aren't cinema contrived supermen doing impossible moves with FX stuff, hooked up to wires and enhanced with computers, these are genuine actors in a believable script, in a seemingly true scenario with a view so wide that it pulls you into the picture.

There was only thing that bugged me though and that was the name of the Duke's sidekick, Mississippi, too campy when you compare it too his sidekick from Rio Bravo, Colorado. I like those States enough its just that the names are too long to keep hearing over and over again during gunfights and such. Like I said at first though, a good movie, great for sitting in your favorite chair, putting your feet up on a rainy Saturday afternoon and enjoying. Herman",El Dorado
110,krskiff,One of the best acted Westerns,9,14 December 2015,"On the cover, this seems like a run-of-the-mill John Wayne western. Sure, it's got the rough-and-tumble Wayne in his famed gunslinger role, it's got the gunfights, and it's got the saloons. But this one sets itself apart due to incredibly strong supporting roles by Robert Mitchum, James Caan, and Arthur Hunnicut.Every supporting character in this well-directed western has their own personality and feel like more than a typical Western stereotype. The sheriff, the sheriff's sidekick, John Wayne's sidekick, and the love interest all have their own unique flair and work together seamlessly.The humor is woven into the plot very well. Several scenes will even have your sides shaking with suppressed merriment!This is a John Wayne western, but it is among the best of the bunch and definitely in my top 10 Westerns.",El Dorado
111,randymoore,"Wayne at one of his best roles, just being himself!",10,27 January 2001,"John Wayne was always at his best when he played himself, or what America thought of John Wayne.  It's been 25 years since he made his last movie, 21 years since his passing, and he is still, and always will be America's hero and best loved movie star.  What you saw in this movie is what John Wayne was...honest, strong, and a man overcoming adversaries by sheer perserverance.  May John Wayne live forever...",El Dorado

113,cowboypimpin58,One of the Great American Westerns...,9,6 August 2006,"every once and a while me and my father will buy a classic western no matter how cheesy or weird it may look, today he came home with this movie El Dorado, at first i was expecting not too much due to how many westerns that were made, though i should have thought better whenever i saw that it starred two great film actors John Wayne and Robert Mitchum.i may be young(16) but i know good actors when i watch them on screen these two played beautifully off each other and so did another great actor James Caanall the characters were played to perfection, even though anyone can play an alcoholic sheriff with a broken-heart Mitchum really made the role shine, of course John Wayne did wonderful as The Hired Gun, but my favorite role was that of Mississipi played by James Caan, in my opinion he did an astonishing job in this role and the scenes with him and Wayne were glorious.Now some older ladies and gents may find it hard to follow the recommendation of a 16 year old but it is seriously one of my favorites of the ones me and my father have seenin a lil side note the action scenes were done really well and there was also a slight editing issue during one of the scenes I'm sure you'll notice(but you must take into consideration the time when the movie was made)thank you and you really must see this movie that could never be done today due to the fight between stars in leading roles.",El Dorado
114,mycrownhim,Classic John Wayne,10,3 May 2020,"One of my favorite movies of all time. Classic John Wayne in a lighter role. I loved seeing he and Robert Mitchum playing off each other, along with a really young James Caan, playing the part seriously which made his character that much more fun. Great one to see again and again.",El Dorado
115,importtunerhks99,One of the best John Wayne Movies,10,26 May 2007,"The Duke plays the role of Cole Thornton, one of the three fastest guns in the west. In a small town called ""El Dorado"" Thornton turns down a job from Bart Jason that would pit Thornton against his old friend Sheriff J.P. Hara, the second of the three fastest guns in the west, who has become a drunk. While on his way into the town he is shot in the side by Joey Macdonald, who informs him that Bart Jason wants to have her family killed. Thornton finds out that McCloud, the third fastest gun has been hired by Jason to stop Thornton and J.P. Thornton also recruits a man called Missisippi who has a style of his own. Bull, a deputy, also adds a unique touch to the movie.The acting and the story is what makes this western stand out from the rest. The actors are really convincing and they each have their own unique dialogue or tone that they set. This movie is especially excellent to show to someone who has never seen a western, cause its easy to follow and when its over you'll want more and more.",El Dorado
116,mkovach-1,My favorite John Wayne film.,10,21 October 2004,"This is my all time favorite John Wayne film. Not that I believe this was his best work, but it is the one I most enjoy watching time and time again. The pairing of Duke with Robert Mitchum in this film was great. James Caan , at the very start of his career, was an excellent addition to this cast. The only detraction I find in this film is that Mitchum seems to have a problem deciding which leg he is supposed to be limping on. Christopher George is also a welcome addition and was one of my favorite actors (tv series Rat Patrol) during my youth. An ensemble of well known and soon to be well known names adorn this picture and I enjoy watching it no matter how many times I've seen it before.",El Dorado
117,scott-770-210712,All time favorite John Wayne movie,10,17 June 2020,"Seem it a hundred times.

118,bennyadamsky,"One of my all-time favorite movies, regardless of genre.t",10,24 May 2021,"This has been one of my all-time favorite movies for years, I've watched it countless times!But, it has way too many dialogue goofs that make me scratch my head as to why Hawks never corrected them? I suppose his budget mdid or he was just too lazy? They are so nonsensical, they detract from the the particular s .cenes.",El Dorado
119,webbpoint-63-608383,"Wayne and Hawks remember ""Red River""",9,5 January 2017,"I've seen ""El Dorado"" several times, but hadn't ever noticed John Wayne's pants' belt buckle before today while watching the film on a very large screen TV. The buckle shows the Red River D brand from the 1948 Howard Hawks movie ""Red River"" starring John Wayne, Montgomery Clift, and Joanne Dru; which was another classic Hawks directed western film. Also, in ""Rio Bravo,"" Hawks again makes ties to ""Red River"" when Dean Martin sings ""Settle Down,"" the main theme from ""Red River"" composed by Dimitri Tiomkin with lyrics by Frederick Herbert. I wonder how many other connections there are to ""Red River"" Hawks/Wayne movies? I'm going to have to look very closely at ""Hatari"" and ""Rio Lobo.""",El Dorado
120,howlett22,Disappointing copy of Rio Bravo,7,14 September 2020,"I watched this film knowing very little about it before I started. I loved Hawks other Westerns (Red River & Rio Bravo) so I had high hopes for this. The film starts well but after the intro of the James Caan character he & Wayne head back to the town of El Dorado and the film just becomes a carbon copy of Rio Bravo. It's really unbelievable how similar the story is. Quite disappointing for a film maker of Howard Hawks quality. Frankly I'm amazed that there are so many high scoring ratings for this film. The story in itself is a great one (copying Rio Bravo it has to be), however it does need to be marked down quite a lot for its lack of originality. Because it's so similiar to Rio Bravo I really couldn't give El Dorado more than 6/10.",El Dorado
121,manikantan-narendernath,Best Chemistry between the big two,10,7 April 2006,"What you cannot miss in the movie is the Timing and chemistry between the Sheriff and the Gunman. Enjoyed watching the movie and went out and bought a VCD (sniff!! Sniff! DVD not available). Truly a collectors item. Would rank it with Hawkes' Hatari, a movie I saw when young among some of the most beautiful films ever made. The signature swagger of the Duke is something that makes the duke and Robert Mitchum as a whiskey bellied Drunk sheriff was awesome. James Caan (Think it was his debut) was able to carve screen space, the bulk of which was already taken up by the big two. Don't miss the title song - one of the best western theme songs. Fast paced, snappy and entertaining without a single unnecessary scene or a dialog.",El Dorado
