0,MartinHafer,it tries so hard to be profound,5,9 June 2005,"It's obvious that the people who made this movie tried very hard and wanted to make a touching film. They seem to have done a good job for some, as it is an immensely popular film and so many view it as a classic. However, to me, I just couldn't get past the fundamental silliness of the plot. So, even if the acting is good and music is lovely, I just couldn't get past the fact that Costner's character had apparently lost his mind. It just didn't make sense. I would have loved it if the voices hadn't told him to build a ball field in the middle of a corn field, but had told him to put fruit on his head and dance like Carmen Miranda! So, if you want to enjoy the movie, be sure to turn off your brain and enjoy the ride. On that level, it is a very successful movie. As for me, I didn't enjoy it and couldn't understand all the hoopla about this film. It just didn't resonate with me.",Field of Dreams
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Beautiful, timeless film",9,23 April 2010,"I wasn't expecting to like Field of Dreams, but I did. More like loved it even. It is a beautiful, timeless charming film that has a delightful blend of the blind-fate story and the fanciful feel-good charm of Frank Capra. The film may be a little slow in one or two parts, but it is beautifully filmed, honest and well acted. The film is lovely to look at, the cinematography is beautiful and the scenery is stupendous. The score is soothing, relaxing and somewhat nostalgic and the well told story, about a man who hears a voice and turns the field his family adores into a baseball pitch, displays the themes of family, redemption and following your dreams. The script is like the film, honest, well crafted and has some delightfully poignant moments. And the acting is great, as he epitomises determination in a very dignified way Kevin Costner gives one of his best performances, and Amy Madigan is touching as his loyal wife. James Earl Jones is wholly convincing as Terrence Mann, while Ray Liotta, Frank Whaley and Burt Lancaster distinctively and solidly represent the spirit world. Overall, a great film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Field of Dreams
2,bkoganbing,The Ghosts Of Baseball Past,9,11 July 2009,"Like Joan Of Arc who heard voices and saved her nation, Kevin Costner hears some voices who tell him to do one incredibly screwy thing. Build a baseball field, take out a couple of acres that could grow Iowa corn and some wonderful things will happen. But what those things are, even he can't imagine.Good thing he has the loving support of wife Amy Madigan and daughter Gaby Hoffman. He's got a Grinch of a brother-in-law in Timothy Busfield who is the closest thing to a villain in Field Of Dreams. Busfield is very good in the scenes he's in.The voices also tell Costner to get reclusive writer James Earl Jones in on his obsession and both of them get a mission to track down an obscure major league player from the old New York Giants who got one game in the big leagues and then left to pursue medicine. Burt Lancaster plays the older Archie 'Moonlight' Graham and Frank Whaley plays him as a callow baseball loving youth. Incidentally this was Lancaster's farewell performance on the big screen. For all the many and complex roles that Lancaster did in his career, this part as a simple country doctor, the kind that has vanished from our society is a great screen valedictory. By the way there was a real Moonlight Graham who did play one game for the Giants of John McGraw during the twenties. So that makes another real life person Burt Lancaster portrays on screen. As another member of the Giants at that time Casey Stengel always used to say, 'you could look it up'.So Costner builds his baseball diamond, his Field Of Dreams and so much happens to him and others he's touched. Including a group of suspended players known infamously as the Chicago Black Sox who conspired to throw the 1919 World Series. The degree of complicity in each one of them varied, but the most well known case was that of Shoeless Joe Jackson whose spirit is embodied in Ray Liotta. There's on factual error in here. When you see Swede Risberg in catcher's gear, realize he was the shortstop for the White Sox, he never caught. The catcher for the team was Ray Schalk who is in the Hall of Fame and who was not part of the group that dumped games.More legends surround baseball than all the other sports we Americans follow put together. They are a part of our history as much as the accomplishments of any presidents. Foreigners watching Field Of Dreams might not understand that and a great deal of the film will be lost on them. I'll wager more people will know Ty Cobb's lifetime batting average of .367 than can tell us what certain provisions of the Constitution are where. Then again as Liotta says, Cobb was so disliked in life, he wasn't invited as the ghosts of baseball past play in Costner's Iowa cornfield.And believe me, Field Of Dreams is far from corn.",Field of Dreams
3,SnoopyStyle,A movie original,8,21 April 2014,"Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) is a NYer who had a complex relationship with his father, went to Berkley, married Iowa girl Annie (Amy Madigan), bought a farm, and had a girl Karin (Gaby Hoffmann). Then he hears a voice in his corn field telling him, ""If you build it, he will come."" He sees an image of a baseball field, and Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta). All kidding aside, he plows under his corn and builds the baseball field. Then Shoeless Joe shows up. Then the rest of the Black Sox. Then the voice comes back saying ""Ease his pain."" When the town tries to ban Terence Mann (James Earl Jones), Annie wins the day and Ray thinks it's Terence's pain that he's suppose to ease.I love this movie and the ideas in this movie. It is more than a baseball movie and glimpse into the meaning of something deeper. The best way to describe this is to say that this is a chick flick for men. It's emotional about baseball and fatherhood. If you're in the mood for it, this will bowl you over. If you're looking for overblown action, this will leave you rolling your eyes.",Field of Dreams
4,Hitchcoc,Effective Sentimentality,9,14 February 2007,"It takes a lot to make a good baseball movie. This is one of the best. It's about a man who is visited in an almost ""Noah's Ark"" kind of way, by spirits that tell him to build a baseball field in an Iowa cornfield. Kevin Costner has apparently made himself the cinematic voice of the sport, creating many interesting baseball movies. This, of course, balances a sense of the man's sanity (sort of like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind) versus a supernatural element that the sport of baseball has become. Of course, our hero not only accomplishes what he sets out to do, he begins to see things that only those with a childlike innocence can see. There is an attachment to Ray's feelings of an empty childhood that is hard to resist. Of course, there's one of the greatest quotes ever delivered in a movie: ""Is this heaven?"" ""No, it's Ioway."" It has sentimentality for sure, but it overcomes it very well and becomes an outstanding film.",Field of Dreams
5,classicsoncall,"""I have just created something totally illogical"".",10,23 May 2009,"It's a little hard to explain why this film affects me the way it does. For other posters on this board as well as myself, the story really doesn't have much to do with baseball per se. It has all to do with one's relationship with family, and more notably, a father that one wishes he had a better relationship with. Not that mine was bad, but looking back on it now, it could have been so much better. The blame goes both ways, and I don't recall ever having a conversation with him that lasted more than a couple of sentences. I would ask him about the war (WW II), and he would shrug it off as if his story wouldn't matter. Now that he's gone, I find myself visiting his grave and spending more time talking to him now than I ever did back when he was around. So even though I can sit here and choke back some emotion as I write this, it's all but impossible to do so when Ray Kinsella sees his dad unbuckling the shin guards and the flash of recognition hits him. I think back almost fifty years ago to the time when I would have a catch with my dad, never even thinking back then what it would be like when he wouldn't be around anymore. And then I think about my own boys, and have to consider if when they watch this movie, they might wonder the same things about me.I know this is supposed to be a movie review, but you'll have to cut me some slack. The above is pretty much all I want to say here, besides recommending the film for it's own sake. It's story telling at it's finest, mixing elements of fantasy and reality in a wonderful way, and laying it all out there for the baseball kid in all of us. We all have our own idea of what heaven might be like, and the movie reminds us that it might be a pretty good idea to take a few good practice swings while we're still here.",Field of Dreams
6,gavin6942,Ray Liotta and a Baseball Bat: No Broken Legs?,7,24 April 2006,"That's right, you read my headline: Ray Liotta is a main character in this movie, he has a baseball bat... and he doesn't hit anyone or swear. That's one of two complaints. The other complaint? This movie made me cry. How dare they touch my soft spot! In this now-classic film, Kevin Costner hears voices that have him build a baseball diamond, track down J.D. Salinger and dig up a dead doctor. When threatened by the bank his house is going to be foreclosed, no sweat: go see a Red Sox game, kidnap a man with a fake gun and euthanize a black man who might be Darth Vader. And guess what? They man forcing him to sell (his brother-in-law) decides he's not crazy after all.So yeah, it's really good. It has some classic music that fits the scenes perfectly (Patsy Cline worked well, for example). Oh, and did I mention Ben Affleck appears in this film? And Matt Damon? If you get a high-definition TV with a 2000 inch screen, you might be able to see them. Or if not, you'll notice Robert DeNiro's mole is 10 feet wide. Oh wait, that's another movie.You don't have to like baseball to like this movie. You just have to like the 80s and tolerate Kevin Costner. It's really a film about a son who wants to get his dad back. Kind of like ""Frequency""... and both movies involve the father/son connected in a mysterious way to achieve improbable goals. I wonder if the ""Frequency"" guys realized they were ripping off ""Field of Dreams"" (besides making a film with some really nonsense plot holes). But that's another review, so never mind.""Field of Dreams""? Watch it. Seriously. It might not be Costner's best (""Waterworld"") but it makes the kids happy.",Field of Dreams
7,lee_eisenberg,"If you film it, certain things will come.",7,30 June 2007,"I'm going to admit that it will probably sound a little strange what got me interested in ""Field of Dreams"". On ""The Simpsons"", ""The Itchy & Scratchy"" show had an episode called ""Field of Screams"", and my parents identified what it spoofed. Also, when Burt Lancaster died, I saw his filmography, and it included this. So I finally saw the movie.What is the movie's overall purpose? Hard to say, as there are several things that the movie brings up. Certainly it was crazy what Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) did. Probably my favorite scene was the courthouse, when Annie (Amy Madigan) challenges the attacks on Terence Mann (James Earl Jones). But when Mann identified that we elected Nixon twice, it solidly indicates what hypocrites we were. Prior to watching this movie, I'd never really been into baseball; I'd certainly never heard of the 1919 White Sox scandal. I wonder if I should study it more.Do I consider this flick a masterpiece? I wouldn't go so far as to say that. But I would say mystifying and definitely worth seeing. Also starring Gaby Hoffman, Ray Liotta, Timothy Busfield and Frank Whaley.",Field of Dreams
8,jboothmillard,Field of Dreams,8,4 September 2006,"First time I saw this I thought it was only worth watching, but giving it another chance made me think twice and enjoy it much more, from director Phil Alden Robinson (Sneakers). Basically Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) hears a voice in his corn field saying ""If you build it, he will come"" (which was number 39 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes). He realises that it means he needs to build a baseball field, so that the spirits of Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) and the other seven Chicago White Sox players, all banned from playing in the 1919 World Series. Ray succeeds in getting them to come, but then another voice tells him ""Heal his pain"", and he interprets this as finding Boston 60's author Terence Mann (James Earl Jones), who missed the chance to see a Red Sox game, which Ray envisioned in a dream. Of course during the game the voice returns with the words ""Go the distance"", which Terence hears too, and they go to Minnesota to find Dr. Archibald ""Moonlight"" Graham (Burt Lancaster). Ray does meet him, and not long after he and Terence return to Iowa for a baseball game that many other people are believed to come to, they will hear voices too. The ending of the film of course is most memorable, because ""he will come"" actually referred to the spirit of another baseball player, his father (younger) John Kinsella (Dwier Brown)! The final scene of the film sees Ray eventually ask his Dad for a bit of catching, and in the distance hundreds of car lights approaching. Also starring Amy Madigan as Annie Kinsella, Gaby Hoffmann as Karin Kinsella, Timothy Busfield as Mark and Frank Whaley as Archie Graham. Costner is a good lead, and his supporting actors do well also, it is very heart-warming fantasy drama story. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Music for James Horner, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture. Kevin Costner was number 93 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 9 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the ending, and it was number 28 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!",Field of Dreams
9,ccthemovieman-1,A Memorable Film For Most Men,10,10 January 2007,"The movie is a rarity in one respect: a non-violent film that is almost strictly a man's film, one that brought tears to millions of men who watched it. For one thing, anyone who has ever played catch with his dad will be very touched by this story.This is pure fantasy and has some schlock, if I'm using the right word, mixed in with some sickeningly-Sixties Liberalism but the good parts are SO good that they far outweigh anything else and make this film one I've always treasured.To me, this movie has many memorable scenes, too many too mention here especially since there are enough reviews already. Suffice to say it's hard to beat those nighttime shots of the ball diamond between the house and cornfield and those mystical moments when the players suddenly appear on the diamond. My favorite character in the movie was ""Doc"" Graham, played superbly by Burt Lancaster in the last movie role he ever played, and by Frank Whaley as a younger ""Archie."" Kevin Costner, as ""Ray Kinsella,"" the star of the film, is outstanding, too. It's nice to see a guy who knows how to play baseball. Costner is a fine ballplayer in his own right. I didn't care for his wife, ""Annie,"" in here, played by Amy Madigan, who supplies us with a lot of the Liberal propaganda with her PTA ""debate,"" a few other comments and just the way she sees things, although she is a great wife in here to a husband who appeared to have lost his marbles. She was supportive and loving: what more does a husband need?James Earl Jones is good as the former leftist radical who would rather leave his past behind and just extol the virtues of baseball, which he does here expertly. I loved the scene with he and Kevin Costner at Fenway Park in Boston. Ray Liotta, who plays ""Joe Jackson,"" became a star because of this movie.Politics aside, this a special movie to anyone who has dreams, yearns at times for the good 'ole days, loves baseball, enjoys a good time-travel-type of story and is a sentimentalist at heart. I plead ""guilty"" on all counts.If you own the special-edition, or rent it, please check out some of the features. They are among the best I have ever watched on a DVD. This is one of those films that inspired me to buy the book, too.",Field of Dreams
10,rmax304823,America's National Sport: Hallucinating.,6,31 July 2012,"Kevin Costner is Ray Kinsella, an uncertain Iowa corn farmer with a loving wife, cute daughter, big farmhouse, and many acres of land worth $2200 each. And one night, messing around in the corn, it seems to become alien. ""If you build it, he will come,"" whispers a voice. His wife chuckles and dismisses the experience, as do his fellow farmers at the feed store. But this is a fantasy, not a psychiatric case study, and Costner interprets the command to mean, ""Mow down half your corn crop and build a baseball field and bleachers in its place."" He does so, putting his farm at risk, although things begin to happen. The whole 1916 Chicago White Sox team appears out of the remaining crop and happily begin to play and cuss each other out, all of them ghosts of course. Costner can see them and so can his wife and little girl but the evil mortgage company can't.Other commands come to Costner, like, ""Ease his pain."" And ""Archie Midnight Graham."" They lead him to spend what little cash he has left on a cross-country trip to enlist the reclusive James Earl Jones, as a J. D. Salinger figure, and Burt Lancaster as a failed ball player who became a country doctor and died years ago, so he must be resurrected too, like the baseball players.It has to do with the fulfillment of dreams, I guess. And Costner has personal issues involving his estrangement from his now deceased father. The musical score, which sounds at times as if it were being played on musical glasses, boosts the already high sentimentality quotient. The viewer's eyes brim with tears as he watches the awe with which the ghosts and the living interact, the long impregnated pauses between lines, while the viewer tries not to cry or to swoon.Warning: Tea Party types, avoid this. Never mind any regard you have for baseball. There is a confrontation at the PTA meeting between Costner's liberal wife and a ""Nazi cow"" who wants to ban a novel written years ago by Jones because it's pornographic and the author might be a Commie. Jones, who was at the barricades during the 60s, is held up as a hero who is disillusioned with the past. There are references to ""Tricky Dick."" Not that the movie is a rabble rouser. Costner's wife's attitudes may be liberal but they're viewer friendly. ""Whatever happened to the First Amendment?"", she asks the PTA audience. And, ""Who wants to spit on the Constitution?"" The whole movie at times seems to be aimed at recovering the dreams of the 1960s, not 1916, when the White Sox blew the World Series. The message is, ""Never give up your dreams."" Try to remember that. One of the problems is that the dreams are already lost. Even the illusions are faded and yellow. Forget baseball and the 1960s. It might as well be, ""Remember the Maine"". When I was a child there was only one game, the National Sport, and it was professional baseball. But then our patience (or impatience) evolved. Baseball fans had to sit around during time outs, and wait for the pitcher to check out the bases and pause, then the wind up, then the pitch -- as likely as not, a ball at which the batter did not swing. It required forbearance.Then professional football replaced the college amateurs. It was faster and more brutal than baseball. Then professional basketball, in which the action is constant. And then professional hockey, a metaphor for war in which the combatants are already armed. Do we have professional cage fighting yet? I forget.Well, the movie is a fantasy, after all, and isn't meant to evoke Deep Thoughts about the evolution of our national character. The ghosts of various period don't seem to follow any particular rules in their comings and goings. The movie doesn't either. I don't know why James Earl Jones was dragged into the story or why he disappears into the now welcoming corn. But the casting is nearly perfect. If you want two more gentlemanly types than Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones, you'd have to search the corn fields for them. Even Burt Lancaster has now grown old enough so that his voice, though distinctively his, has a slight gargle and his presence is comforting. And that Iowa farm, with the big white house perched placidly on its knoll, surrounded by what looks like an infinity of leafy forest green, is unforgettably accommodating, as are the many sunsets.",Field of Dreams
11,moonspinner55,Old-fashioned corn given new Hollywood sheen,7,10 September 2005,"Iowa farmer and his wife are the laughing stock of their small town after he plows over acres of his corn field to build a baseball diamond. Why? Because a whole plan has been set into motion, and Ray and his farm are the lucky ones chosen. A meaningful experience for moviegoers, especially men, touches upon everything that we collectively hold dear to us: the past, the dead, redemption, forgiveness, and the reuniting of loved ones and heroes. The performances are variable, with Amy Madigan's post-hippie spouse way over the top and James Earl Jones as a reclusive writer giving sermons in place of a performance (although I loved his exit into the corn field, and his giggle of pure joy). Kevin Costner carries all this whimsy on his shoulders like a trouper; he has that old-time Hollywood magic like a modern-day Gary Cooper, and he is surprisingly appealing, comfortable and relaxed. The film really has no shame, and pulls out all the sentimental stops, but if you're attuned to its themes, you're likely to find it magical.",Field of Dreams
12,edwagreen,Field of Dreams: Dream On **12,5,9 July 2011,"Had they put this farce to music, we would have had another ""Damn Yankees."" We need a Lola and a Ray Walston to heat things up.My major fault with this film is where is it going? An Iowan farmer who had a bad relationship with his baseball player father, builds a field years later and all the dead players come back to play on it. Kind of eerie, isn't it? Some of the players are from the disgraced 1919 Chicago Whitesox Team. Remember, they threw the world series that year.As always, Burt Lancaster is effective in his role. James Earl Jones, in his part as the writer, is commanding and Kostner readily realizes the role of the conflicted mid-west farmer. Amy Madigan, as his wife, is so natural in her performance.After viewing this film, we can easily walk away and say, ""So what!""",Field of Dreams
13,sunwarrior13,"If You Build It, He Will Come",10,30 December 2011,"""If you build it, he will come"" That's the ethereal message that inspires Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella to construct a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield in this movie entitled,Field Of Dreams. The film stars Kevin Costner, Amy Madigan, James Earl Jones, Ray Liotta, and Burt Lancaster in his final motion picture.This is adapted from the novel Shoeless Joe by W. P. Kinsella and it is directed by Phil Alden Robinson.While walking in his cornfield, novice farmer Ray Kinsella hears a voice that whispers, ""If you build it, he will come"", and sees a baseball diamond. His wife, Annie, is skeptical, but she allows him to plow under his corn to build the field. At first, ""he"" seems to be the ghost of disgraced ballplayer Shoeless Joe Jackson, who materializes on the ball field and plays a few games with the awestruck Ray. But as the weeks go by, Ray receives several other messages from a disembodied voice, one of which is ""Ease his pain."" He realizes that his ball field has been divinely ordained to give a second chance to people who have sacrificed certain valuable aspects of their lives. One of these folks is Salingeresque writer Terence Mann, whom Ray kidnaps and takes to a ball game and then to his farm. Another is Doc Graham, a beloved general practitioner who gave up a burgeoning baseball career in favor of medicine. The final ""second-chancer"" turns out to be much closer to Ray. That ""magical"" field in Dyersville, Iowa still draws thousands of baseball-happy tourists each year.This is definitely an instant baseball classic for the family. Field of Dreams sustains a dreamy mood in which the idea of baseball is distilled to its purest essence: a game that stands for unsullied innocence in a cruel, imperfect world.Aside from that,it is also a sentimental film that has themes about family togetherness. This is definitely a tear- jerker for the male audience.With the performances,Kevin Costner provides a great portrayal of Ray Kinsella,who is able to provide realism in this fairy-tale story that mixes unusual themes such as family and sports.This is one of the best sports movie ever made in the 80's.",Field of Dreams

15,hitchcockthelegend,Capra meets Serling for 1980's joyously multi genre hankie wetter.,9,4 March 2008,"Coming back to Field Of Dreams over 20 years after its release finds this particular viewer beaming with happiness that the warmth I felt way back when still washes over me in the same way. Director Phil Alden Robinson (All of Me/Fletch) manages to turn W.P. Kinsella's novel, Shoeless Joe, into a multi genre film with deep emotional heart for both sexes to latch on to. It has a beautiful mix of mythology and family values that come together to realise a dream that ultimately rewards those viewers who are prepared to open themselves up to pure fantasy with a deep emotional core.It was nominated for best picture in 1989 because it struck a cord with so many people, it's not just the thematic heart of the film that delivers, it's also the actors on show who perfectly realise this delightful tale. Kevin Costner is surrounded by great workers in Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones, Amy Madigan and Burt Lancaster, and he wisely lets these actors dominate the scenes that he shares with them, it's something that is an often forgotten good point of Costner's performances; that he is comfortable to let his co-stars dominate important narrative snatches. However, he is the glue that binds the whole film together, it's quite a naturally engaging performance that rightly gave him the star status he would achieve post release of the film.As a born and bred Englishman I don't profess to appreciate just how much a way of life Baseball is to Americans, but I do have my own sports in England that I'm happy to dream the dream with in equal measure, and with that I understand all the themes in Field Of Dreams big time. Most of all, though, I can involve myself with its family values, the dream of dreams, and because it's undeniably pure escapist cinema for those who aren't afraid to let their respective guards down for a wee short while, the rewards are many. With a lush James Horner score evocatively layered over the top of it and John Lindley's photography almost ethereal at times, production is suitably in the fantasy realm.Never twee or over sweet, Field of Dreams is a magical movie in more ways than one. A film that manages to have its cake and eat it and then closes down with one of the most beautiful endings of the 80's.

16,Doylenf,"Natural performances, nice blend of fantasy and truth...",8,10 April 2005,"KEVIN COSTNER can be proud of his performance in FIELD OF DREAMS as the young farmer in Iowa who decides to follow his dream rather than lead the sort of existence his father did. He builds a baseball field on his farm and therein lies the fantasy awaiting in the cornfield. Ballplayers from the past--notably 'Shoeless Joe Jackson' of the scandalous Black Sox team (brilliantly played by Ray Liotta)--come to life when they play on the field.A fantasy such as this is hard to pull off--but director/writer Phil Robinson does exactly that. His cast is first rate, with Kevin Costner and Ray Liotta outstanding and natural in deceptively simple roles. Amy Madigan gives great support as Costner's supportive wife. And walking through the mist in one of the film's most touching sequences is BURT LANCASTER, handsomely aged and gently playing a superb cameo role as a doctor who had dreams of his own in the past.A nice unobtrusive score by James Horner lends the finishing touch. And, of course, the wonderful James Earl Jones lends his own stamp of authority to the role of a legendary writer who at first resists Costner's plea for help.In my opinion, both Costner and Liotta deserved Oscar nominations, so earnest and appealing are their performances. The most explicit message here seems to be: By all means, be true to yourself and follow your dream.",Field of Dreams

Kevin Costner plays Ray Kinella, a corn farmer whose passion is baseball. He hears a voice urging him to build a baseball diamond. With that comes players appearing who have been long since deceased. Ray Liotta plays ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson who first appears much to the awe of Ray and his family. Jackson is bewildered but welcomes the opportunity to play again and invites other players that were affected by a scandal in 1919. Amy Madigan plays Ray's supportive wife who is not sure about it all but provides encouragement. His daughter believes in him and can also see the ball players. James Earl Jones plays controversial author Terence Mann whom Ray seeks out as a piece to the puzzle. He is bitter and prefers to be left alone but Ray's banter strikes his curiosity. Timothy Busfield as Ray's brother-in-law is a weak element with his struggle to convince Ray to sell the farm. It contains an underground theme of faith and believing in something. These players are given a ghostly opportunity to enjoy their passion while Ray discovers a new direction in life. He makes one final connection before thousands of headlines loom over the horizon to witness what seeing is believing is all about.

19,HotToastyRag,Great Americana movie,7,20 June 2017,"If only everyone had a wife like Amy Madigan. I wonder if she's that fantastic in real life (I'm looking at you, Ed Harris). Whether she is or not, she plays a supportive beyond belief wife to Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams, supporting him unconditionally when he hears a voice telling him to tear up their Iowa cornfield and build a baseball diamond so that Shoeless Joe Jackson will come and play ball in their backyard.I won't reveal any more of the plot, but just get ready for an unbelievable adventure (and I mean that in a good way). Some people could interpret the message as a religious one, so if you like religious or spiritual movies, you'll love this one. If you take a different interpretation, it's a really enjoyable slice of Americana, with both hilarious and heartfelt moments. And for the ladies in the audience, there's an abundance of eye candy as a bonus! If you like baseball, Kevin Costner, or movies about chasing your dreams, this is a perfect summer movie to watch.

Ray then pursues a reclusive author (James Earl Jones) to assist him with his fantastical situation.I know respectable people who cite ""Field of Dreams"" (1989) as their favorite movie and it does have some magic, along with some welcome humor and a fun road movie section, but it's burdened by the thoroughly unreal set-up, which likely would appeal to hardcore baseball fans. Still, I appreciate the message on spiritual guidance, dreams and the insouciant diligence to act on them.The film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, and was shot in Iowa (Dyersville, Farley & Dubuque), Illinois (Galena), and Boston, Massachusetts.GRADE: B-/C+",Field of Dreams
21,safenoe,When Kevin Costner's films were great,10,9 November 2021,"Field of Dreams is a movie for the cinema and it's a shame I saw it only on DVD. But still, Field of Dreams is worth watching for sure, and I was surprised to learn that in real life Ray Liotta hated playing baseball as a kid. Anyway, you really want Field of Dreams to be real, and in a way it was, because this year the Chicago White Sox were up against New York Yankees in a real MLB game. Yes, Kevin Costner turned up to lead the teams to the field.",Field of Dreams
22,mm-39,Costner's high water mark,8,18 September 2002,"Before Costner tried to please the critics, he made some challenging films. This film is his best.  A 60 homerun season, if he ever bests this that would be incredible.  Fantasy/Science Fiction film that is believable.  What if the ghosts from the past appeared in a corn field, made into a baseball diamond.  Wrongs could be corrected, people could do what they love baseball, and redemption could be found.  I will not ruin this story for you, but it is a strange one.  So strange that it works.  Original, creative, and most of all entertaining.  Rent this one, way better than the other crop movie Signs. 8/10 A classic!",Field of Dreams
23,Mr-Fusion,For sincere love of the game,9,19 April 2017,"I was a kid when I first saw ""Field of Dreams"" - had to have been 10 years old or so - and I liked it because my parents did (a crowd- pleaser with Kevin Costner at peak star-power; of course they liked it). And maybe the reason this movie has such an effect on me is because I'm the same age as his character with a mortgage of my own. But there's nothing about it that's contrived. It's easy to see the man's struggle as something we can all relate to, and those dramatic moments that could just so easily go wrong in any other movie seem to come from a place of honesty here. It's just a tremendously warm and soul-enriching story; spiritual in a way that even a non- religious schmo like me can get sucked into. It's precision- engineered to tap those cherished memories of going out into the sun with Dad and playing a game of catch. For my money, that shared interest in the game is the most wholesome thing we have in this country, and this movie nails it. Also, if you can sit through this and not leave a blubbering idiot, check your pulse.9/10",Field of Dreams
24,JamesHitchcock,A Fitting Climax to Burt Lancaster's Career,9,26 March 2005,"One thing I have noticed about movies with a sporting theme is how certain sports seem to lend themselves to a cinematic treatment more easily than others. I cannot, for example, think of a single memorable film about golf, tennis or even soccer, the world's most popular spectator sport, and only one (""Chariots of Fire"") about athletics. On the other hand, there are a number of distinguished films about boxing, and the same is true of baseball. I think the reason is that these two sports often take on a metaphorical significance in the cinema so that the film is about a lot more than the game itself.Boxing is generally used as a metaphor for a wider struggle against the hardships of life, as in ""Champion"" or the recent ""Million Dollar Baby"". Baseball, on the other hand, has a similar meaning for Americans to that which cricket has for the English, signifying fair play, sportsmanship and the supposed virtues of the national character. Of the crop of baseball movies made in the eighties and early nineties, two (""Eight Men Out"" and ""Field of Dreams"") dealt with the notorious Chicago Black Sox scandal of 1919 when those virtues were seen to be tarnished by corruption within the game.The two films are very different in their treatment of the affair. ""Eight Men Out"" is a relatively straightforward historical drama, while ""Field of Dreams"" is a surreal fantasy. The central character, Ray Kinsella, an Iowa farmer, has never taken much interest in baseball, although his father was a keen fan with unfulfilled ambitions to be a Major League player. One night, while Ray is standing in his cornfield, he hears a mysterious voice repeating the words ""If you build it, he will come"". At first, he has no idea what these words mean, but later realises that they are an instruction to build a baseball ground on his farm; if he does so, Shoeless Joe Jackson, the star of the Chicago team that threw the World Series, will return to play baseball again. Although he is in financial difficulties, Ray obeys the voice and proceeds to construct the ground, complete with seats and floodlights, and is rewarded when the long-dead Jackson, together with the ghosts of other members of the Black Sox, turn up to play on it. Further mysterious instructions lead to Ray travelling to Boston to track down Terence Mann, a famous radical author from the sixties who has now become a misanthropic recluse, and to Minnesota to find Archie Graham, another baseball player who had one game for the New York Giants in the 1920s before giving up the game to pursue a career as a doctor. (This journey also involves travelling back in time, as Graham died in 1972).I was surprised to hear that this is allegedly President Bush's favourite film. Admittedly, it does deal with the themes of patriotism and the ""American Dream"", but these concepts are not the sole property of the Republican Party, and its politics struck me as being fairly liberal. There is, for instance, a sympathetic portrayal of a left-wing radical (beneath his gruff exterior Terence is actually kindly and sensitive), and the scene in which Ray's wife Annie defends his works against those parents who would ban them from the area's schools and libraries can be seen as a criticism of the religious right. The film as a whole, however, is by no means anti-religious; indeed, it can be seen as a spiritual or religious allegory. The mysterious voice which calls to Ray is never explained in realistic terms; in symbolic terms, however, it can be seen as either the voice of conscience or the voice of God. Only the optimistic, idealistic characters can see the ghostly players; those who are grasping or materialistic, such as Ray's brother-in-law Mark, cannot. (Later on, Mark's eyes are opened and he too shares the vision).All the main characters have unresolved issues in their lives- Joe and his team-mates need to make amends for their past wrongdoing, Terence needs to recapture his lost youthful idealism, Ray is haunted by his disagreements with his late father. Archie wonders whether he could ever have made the grade as a Major League baseball player, although he admits that his medical career has brought him more satisfaction than life as a professional sportsman could have done. (""If I had only been a doctor for five minutes, that would have been a tragedy""). The film shows how they are able to deal with these problems through optimism, imagination and faith.Supernatural fantasy films like this can easily descend into either sentimentality or preposterous whimsy. When they work, however, they can work brilliantly, and ""Field of Dreams"" is a good example. Other examples that come to mind are ""Portrait of Jennie"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" from the forties and Tim Burton's recent ""Big Fish"", a film which shares with ""Field of Dreams"" the theme of father-son reconciliation. All of these films have two things in common; despite a fantastic plot, all seem thoroughly believable and all have an emotionally satisfying conclusion. It is often difficult to say exactly why some films of this nature work and others do not. I think that, as far as ""Field of Dreams"" is concerned, the main reason is that it is acted with perfect sincerity by all concerned, particularly by Kevin Costner as Ray, James Earl Jones as Terence and, most of all, by Burt Lancaster as Dr Graham, a performance so natural that it is easy to overlook the fact that it amounted to little more than a cameo. This was Lancaster's last feature film, but a fitting climax to his career. 9/10",Field of Dreams
25,namashi_1,Nicely Made....,6,21 September 2010,"Adapted from the novel Shoeless Joe by W. P. Kinsella, Phil Alden Robinson's 'Field Of Dreams' is a nicely made film, that touches a chord. It may not be the best-fantasy film of it's time, but it's a film that it's heart at the right place.'Field Of Dreams' is all about the beauty of believing and dreaming. The protagonist over-here, gets respect and success thanks to his dreams, that come true. The basic plot, the situations, the performances, all are a notch-above the ordinary.Phil Alden Robinson's adapted, escapist screenplay is first-class. His direction is neat.

26,Smells_Like_Cheese,Timeless,8,21 September 2009,"So Field of Dreams, pretty famous film over all, created one of the major quotes of movie history ""If you build it, he will come"". My boyfriend was shocked that out of all the movies I had seen, I've never watched Field of Dreams. So he gave me the movie and said that if I'm a true baseball fan that I would watch it, being a (disappointed) fan of the Chicago Cubs, I have to say that he was right. This is a movie that is about the love of baseball. What I enjoyed most about this story is that it felt like it was timeless, this is a movie that really doesn't age, I thought it was made in the 1990's, surprising to find out that it was made in the 1980's. The characters are so wonderful and charming, how could you not adore them and wish for Kevin Costner to succeed in making this baseball field? The love that was put into this movie shows and was a pleasure to watch.Ray Kinsella is a novice farmer who lives in rural Iowa with his wife, Annie, and their young daughter Karin. While walking through his cornfield, Ray hears a voice whisper, ""If you build it, he will come"", and sees a vision of a baseball field. Believing he is somehow being asked to build it, and fearing he is in danger of ""turning into"" his father, Ray strongly wishes to do so. Although skeptical, Annie is supportive. Watched by incredulous neighbors, Ray plows under his corn and builds the field. A year passes without incident. Ray and Annie are eventually forced to consider replacing the field with corn to stay financially solvent. At this point Karin spots a man on the ball field who Ray discovers is Shoeless Joe Jackson, a baseball player idolized by his father. Joe is thrilled to be able to play baseball again and asks to bring others with him to the field. He later returns with the seven other players banned in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, emerging from the corn by the outfield. With the help of others Ray sticks to his faith and believes that this field means something and do whatever he can to find out what this will do for his life.I'm really glad I gave Field of Dreams a chance, it's a delightful film. We have some powerhouse performances from Costner, Liotta and Jones. I'm surprised I didn't see this movie earlier, but better late than never. I think also visually this is one of the most memorable films in is simplicity, Ray Liotta and his teammates coming out of the field and going back in was so memorizing. Also just what it represented in possibly being Heaven or to be forever young and happy, it was wonderful. If you get the chance to see Field of Dreams, I highly recommend it. It's a lovely family film with terrific actors and a timeless story about the love of baseball and making your dreams come true. Not to mention the ultimate tear jerker ending, you'll have to trust me on this one.8/10",Field of Dreams
27,MovieAddict2016,"Well, I liked it.",8,24 September 2005,"I know a lot of people who absolutely despise this movie. I've heard people compare it to Frank Capra and ""Forrest Gump"" in derogatory ways. When it was made known that it is George W. Bush's favorite movie of all-time, it only solidified the theory that it's for fantastical Republicans who like their entertainment peachy-clean and schmaltzy.I finally saw it on AMC about a week ago and I enjoyed it. I actually really liked it, and I'm not a big fan of baseball (or sports) in general.Kevin Costner plays a farmer in Iowa who begins to hear voices and witnesses eerie images in his cornfields. He is convinced that the ghosts of baseball players are telling him to construct a playing field in his cornfields...so he risks it all - his wife, his job, his sanity - and tries to hunt down a guy named Terence Mann (James Earl Jones in one of his best roles), whom he thinks can help him with his mission of faith.This movie is very lightweight and inspirational and ""clean."" It carries a none-too-subtle message of faith against reason - for that reason alone I think many Christians probably enjoy it, and that's why it has become known as a conservative film. It doesn't help, as I said before, that it's Bush's favorite film and Costner is a Republican.Political links aside, I'm a rather pessimistic guy but I still found the story strange, different and entertaining. I enjoyed it. I'm not a big fan of Costner's but in spite of his presence the movie is still amusing and James Earl Jones gives a great performance as a rusty, bitter old man.Yes, ""Field of Dreams"" is a ""nice"" movie and certainly is a feel-good film.

Just so happened to come from my eventual favorite Muppet, Pepe. Awww, Pepe ""Not a Shrimp!"" King Prawn...let THIS be your Field of Dreams.I digress...I've seen this movie once before, remembering liking it, but not that impressed. The premise of a not-crazy man becoming crazy for listening to crazy voices and bankrupting him and his family to build a baseball diamond...well, it was a little farfetched.And then, I see it now, with tears in my eyes. Yep, I sincerely and severely got caught up in the magic. By a grand slam.When I saw this, I wasn't into baseball. In-between viewings, I managed to dive deep into a, sadly, temporary love for the game. Say for about 3-4 years I was heavily into the sport and nearly watched every Diamondback game.

The remaining cast is absolutely perfect, the story is just wondrous, score (which I am currently listening to via YouTube) is great, cinematography very good and the hope and wonder in the revolutions as this film progresses is captivating. If I could throw just one criticism out there: it's too short.Now, that's a complaint I rarely ever make, but there were two major scenes/reveals I wanted to see play out. Sure, though they told us how they'll happen, I still badly wanted to experience the scenarios and knowledge.Other than that minor league issue, they really shot it out of the park.

30,sol1218,When it was a Game,8,15 February 2013,"***SPOILERS** Whimsical and heart warming story that uses the game of Baseball and the infamous 1919 Chicago White Sox, forever known as the Chicago Black Sox, team as some kind of metaphor in bringing together transplanted from Brooklyn NY Iwoa farmer Ray Kinsella, Kevin Costner, with his long dead father John, Dwier Brown, who passed away when Ray was 14. It was when walking through his corn field that Ray keeps hearing this voice telling him ""That if you build it he will come"". Thinking that he's suffering from a mild case of heat stroke Ray doesn't take it seriously until it, or the voice, shows him like a mirage in the desert a baseball diamond situated right in the middle of his cornfield! It's after when Ray bulldozed most of his cornfield under to build a baseball diamond and outfield following the instructions of the mysterious voice that his daughter Karin, Gabby Hoffman, notices a stranger wearing a baseball uniform hanging out on the field looking like he's lost! With Ray and his wife Annie, Amy Madigan, going to check things out it's discovered that the stranger, wearing a 1919 Chicago White Sox uniform,in non other the the great Shoeless Joe Jackson played by Ray Liotta. The most shocking thing about all this despite Shoeless Joe batting right-handed, he was in real life a left handed batter, the guy's been dead and buried for almost 40 years! Flabbergasted at what he as well as his wife Amy and daughter Karin are seeing Ray watches in stunned disbelief all the members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox emerge ,like ghosts in the night, out of his remaining corn field to play perpetual baseball without even bothering to eat or sleep!Completely under the spell of the mysterious voice Ray is told to travel to far off Boston and get in touch with 1960's activist and now in hiding and not talking or seeing anyone revolutionary and free love writer Terrence, his friends if he still has any call him Terry, Mann played by James Earl Jones. It's Ray's job according to the voice to not only take the at first very reluctant Mann to the Red Sox A's game at Fenway Park but also have the cash strapped Ray, who just about went broke building his baseball field, to treat him to a beer & hot dog! What the hell was all this about anyway? What's the reason for the voice to instruct Ray to do these mindless crazy and stupid things?We soon find out what's really going on in the movie when on the giant TV scoreboard over Fenway Park's right center field bleachers flashes the name Archibald ""Moonlight"" Graham and the place where he's supposed to be living Chisholm Minnisota that out of the thousands of spectators watching the ball game only Ray & Mann could see! It's when both Ray and the now,in both seeing the light and hearing the voice, very agreeable Terry Mann, who at first thought that Ray was out of his mind, travel to Chisolm where they find out that Archie Garahm, Burt Lancaster, has been dead for the last 16 years! But that very pressing problem is solved with the two, Ray & Terry Mann, soon find themselves brought back in time to the year 1972 just before Graham, who was the town doctor, kicked off and thus be able to talk to him! We later find out what Doc. Graham's purpose was in the movie and it was two fold: One for himself and the other and far more important reason for the Kinsella family! ***SPOILERS*** You've got to suspend belief watching ""Field of Dreams"" like everyone in it including Ray's brother in law Mark, Timothy Busfield, who at first thought that he and his sister Amy were nuts but later saw, when the 1919 White Sox revealed themselves to him, the light of ""reality"" and went along with the program! Touching and emotionally packed final when Ray gets to meet his dad John who like almost everyone else in the movie came back from the dead to play a game of catch with him! And while that's happening not only did he, Ray's dad John, come like the mysterious voice predicted he would but we see cars coming for near and far from all over the state as well as the entire USA to fill the cornfield's spectator seats to capacity at 20 dollars a pop.

31,Lejink,Well-fielded,7,26 October 2014,"I've always been a sucker for fantasy films and even if my knowledge of American baseball only comes from John Simons' wonderful HBO documentary series and occasional movies like ""Eight Men Out"" and ""The Natural"", that was enough to ground me in the background of this very entertaining film.Kevin Costner is the 60's inspired smalltown farmer, happily married to his sassy, hippy wife and baseball-loving daughter seeking redemption for breaking with his dad while growing up. When a mysterious voice commands him to build a baseball field, wonderful, supernatural events occur taking in along the way a reclusive, one-time radical writer and civil-rights campaigner (the kernel of whom is obviously based on J.D. Salinger) and a veteran doctor who as a young baseball rookie, never got his chance to play in the big league.All of them reach out to the ""eight men out"" from history and in different ways find redemption in an admittedly fantastical but still very enjoyable movie. Costner is excellent as the initially unbelieving Ray while Amy Madigan is a good foil as his kooky but clued-up wife, her early defence of freedom-of-speech at a school-parents meeting amply, if obviously highlighting her liberal credentials as well as providing the link to James Earl Jones initially tetchy Terence Mann / Salinger character who quickly gets with the dream.He and Ray later pick up Burt Lancaster's Doc Graham along the way to complete the set of pilgrims. Both Jones and Lancaster add gravitas to the flyaway plot while Ray Liotta gives a subtle portrayal of the sad figure of baseball legend Shoeless Joe Jackson, whose part in the original Chicago Whitesix fix of 1919 has long been disputed. I'm not sure the film needed the back-story of Ray and his wife facing repossession of their house and farm at the hands of her brother, but otherwise this cleverly plotted and interwoven film, beautifully shot in the golden light of Iowa stands as a modern, feel-good classic, regardless I would imagine, of the viewer's knowledge of the history of baseball.",Field of Dreams
32,ElMaruecan82,Heaven as the place where dreams come true ...,10,30 October 2012,"""Field of Dreams"" embraces its own poetry with such daringness that only one epithet comes to my mind: perfect.The film pays a wonderful tribute to baseball, to what the game stands for in American culture. Yet I'm not American and I remember how mesmerized I was by the story, when I saw it the first time with my Dad, when I was only nine. The reason is simple: baseball is the setting, the atmosphere, the reason-to-be of the story, but apart from that, Phil Alden Anderson's masterpiece speaks much more universal statements about life and dreams. And when I saw it on that magical night, I remember we were both enthralled by the opening scene, when Kevin Costner was walking across his cornfield, and heard the mysterious voice whispering to him ""If you build it, he will come"".This line was probably the first I ever strongly remembered from a movie. I believe this says a lot about the power of ""Field of Dreams"": it has the kind of universal appeal that a child can respond to, the idea that the greatest accomplishments can indeed come from nowhere, that we all have some guardian angels guiding our actions and showing us the paths to take. The dream-like escapism is magnificently incarnated through the breathtaking beauty of Iowa's farm, a vast landscape where the colors of the sky marry the sunlight in such a dazzling harmony that it's a mystery that the film didn't get one Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography.Anyways, when Ray hears the voice, he doesn't know what to do until a very explicit vision finally appears. He understands the message, if he builds a baseball diamond, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson will come. The film goes deeper on the Oedipal significance of Jackson, who was the idol of John, Ray's father. John Kinsella was more than 50 years older than Ray, and both hardly got any connection apart from their mutual love for baseball. And it's unfortunately through baseball that Ray expressed his hostility by refusing to play catch with his dad and telling him that his hero was a criminal, referring to the White Sox players who were banned when the World Series was fixed in 1919.And the 'White Sox' scandal is the symbol of what the film is all about: lost dreams. These eight players couldn't play baseball for life, their only dreams were to feel the grass again under their shoes, to breath the wind blowing on the fields and to play, just play. Ray never did anything crazy or substantial in his life -he studied, graduated, lived the sixties, smoked pot, marched then settled in a farm- he believes this is a real opportunity to do something. Ray's biggest fear is to end up like his father who never achieved anything, in a poignant bed conversation with his wife, played by Amy Madigan, Ray decides to build a baseball diamond, no matter how costly it is.And as silly as the idea sounds, his wife supports him, because she understands the value of marriage is also to encourage the one we love to pursue his dream. Naturally, the film evokes the financial problems and the repercussions on Ray's cornfield but the essential is what happens on the field. And after a few months, when the first baseball player appears, when Jackson (Ray Liotta) discovers the field, we know we're unto something magical, never explored in any other film. ""Are you a ghost?"" asks little Karin (Gaby Hoffman) with curiosity. ""Is this heaven?"" he asks in return before leaving for the night, ""No, It's Iowa."" replies an overwhelmed Costner.The baseball diamond becomes a sort of intersection between Heaven and Earth, the universal spot where dreams are fulfilled, when second chances are given. As the film progresses, more and more players come to play, and Ray receives new messages from 'the voice': ""Ease his pain"", ""Go the distance"". A strange and curious odyssey leads him to an influential writer of the 60's, played by James Earl Jones, and to an ex-baseball player who had only one game before he retired and became a doctor. 'Moonlight' Archie Graham, now dead, would give anything to play baseball again, much more with his hero, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, but in fact, just playing the game.Burt Lancaster delivers his last performance in ""Field of Dreams"" as Doc Graham, a man who didn't live wondering why he became a doctor, but what if he played one more time in his life, how thrilling it would be. The Doc is dead since 1972 but Ray finds him while wondering in the streets, and then hitchhiking as a young rookie played by Frank Whaley. At this point, we don't ask questions, we don't wonder why this or that happens, it's all part of the same irrational logic, something guided by mysterious forces. The voice, the vision, the ghosts, we accept them because they're positive, because we feel something magical ought to happen.And magical is an understatement, from the wonderful speech delivered by Jones' unique voice to the last encounter that gives the key to all the mystery surrounding the story, ""Field of Dreams"" ends with the perfect emotional pay-off to one of the most extraordinary journeys into the magic of sport, inspiring the best of human spirit: playing, sharing, connecting: you throw, I catch, giving and taking, the language of the heart in its purest form. It's not just one of the greatest baseball movies, but one of the best sports movie ever made. Still, there's much more in the film.There's the idea that we all must pursue our dreams and tell people we love what we really feel, that no matter what they achieved or didn't, we love and care for them  because as enchanting and inspiring as ""Field of Dreams"" is, it's a fantasy and no matter what we build, some will never come.",Field of Dreams

This film is not directly about baseball and has a very clear message for everyone. The film is about Kevin Costner's character hearing a voice. The voice tells him to build a baseball field in his corn patch. As soon as he finishes the field, the ghosts of the 1919 Black Sox scandal led by Shoeless Joe Jackson appear in the field. The acting is good in this film for the most part. Kevin Costner and Amy Madigan were great as the farming family. James Earl Jones was perfect as a realist author.

That is the first thing i noticed after first time watching this truly moving great fantasy for a first time today in 2015. ""Field of Dreams"" (1989) is a superbly involving fantasy drama for all family. Especially if you like baseball, this movie is like a dream come true. Kevin Costner is probably better then ever in this movie, which is probably his best performance (and i saw every one of his movies except for ""Black & White"" yet, literally) - he is not a typical Kevin Costner here (although i like typical Kevin Costner as well) - this is a very good performance. Amy Madigan does a splendid job as well - they have a superb chemistry. Script is superb, a truly involving story even for those who don't like fantasy. There are some truly amazing cinematography at the beginning of the movie - opening shoots of cornfield are jaw-dropping beautiful - this was like a first sign that i started to watching something very good.Overall, ""Field of Dreams"" will be (or in this case is already) loved by those who likes dreaming, and likes movies that does not have to explain all details - some things just happens, and whether you go along or not. ""Field of Dreams"" is sentimental fantasy, but it is not over sentimental, it knows where to stop, and it has a heart. Great movie.",Field of Dreams
35,ironhorse_iv,"Is this Heaven? No... It's Iowa, but this movie is close to it. Fields of Dreams is a home run!",8,5 October 2014,"This movie is one of my favorite films from my childhood. It's a one of a kind sport movie that mixed spirituality and emotional drama so well. Add, an underlying metaphor of faith and redemption, and you got a masterpiece. I love this movie so much! Directed by Phil Alden Robinson, who also wrote the screenplay, adapting W. P. Kinsella's novel Shoeless Joe. The movie takes the concept of the book and made it so much better. Building up the suspense that is lacking in the book, and gave us a memorable ending that would make any father or son cry. 'If you build it, he will come' quotes the voice that Iowa farmer, Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) hears every night. After a few more visions, he interpret the messages as instructions to build a baseball field on his farm. Sooner than later, he does build it, and find more than he would ever thought of, when the ghosts of baseball past return for one last game. Since the movie moves into more of a magical realism storytelling, it get rid of most of the confusing plot elements from the book such as the depressing storyline with a supposedly ex-Cub named Eddie Scissons. They also changed the real-life cameo of J.D. Salinger from the book to fiction character, author Terrence Mann (James Earl Jones) when it became apparent that Salinger would sue if a fantasy movie was made about him. The movie has this magical realism that kinda hurt the film in a logically sense; there are parts, that doesn't make any sense like time travel, and how the ghost appear and disappear. Still, it's wise, not to think too hard on it, and those things are never truly explain. It will take you out of the film. James Earl Jones does a great job as Terrence Mann. I love his 'People will Come' speech about baseball. James Earl Jones is one of those people who can make you sit down and just listen to what he has to say, he has one of those voices that makes you want to listen to any story he wants to tell. Great actor. Kevin Costner as Ray is memorable, as this movie stands out as one of his best roles. The supporting cast are great in their roles. Special mad props to Ray Liotta as Shoeless Joe Jackson and Burt Lancaster as Moonlight Graham. Both were amazing. Still, their characters were very loosely based on true story. Moonlight Graham was in fact a ballplayer who appeared in only one MLB game. Following that one game, he continued playing professionally through the 1908 season, mostly in the New York State League, until retiring at the age of 30 before becoming a doctor in Chisholm, Minnesota. The film takes some liberties with his story. Graham really died in 1965, but producer Francis Ford Coppola wanted to see his film ""The Godfather"" on a marquee, so Ray goes back to 1972 to find him. The degree of Shoeless Joe Jackson's culpability in the Black Sox Scandal is also changed or little mention to put his character in a better light. Glad, they change the movie from ""Shoeless Joe"" to Field of Dreams, because the movie has little to do with Shoeless Joe Jackson. It would make the movie seem more like a bio-pic. The movie isn't all about baseball. It does have a weird odd sub-plot about book banning that raises some legitimate debate about censorship. While, it's great that they indeed tackle this issue in film and give more depth to Amy Madigan's character, Annie Kinsella; but it's just seem out of the blue, and comes out of nowhere. Did the screen writer, Phil Alden Robinson, have a political agenda he wanted to address? Who knows! This scene could had been avoided. It's really does slow the movie down. It's like talking about football, and somehow brings up the issue of banning art like David Cerny. They really don't connect well in story-telling. The book than the movie had more connection as the author, J.D. Salinger wrote a novel, ""A Young Girl In 1941 With No Waist At All"" featuring a character named Ray Kinsella. Even the novel 'The Catcher in the Rye', had a character named Richard Kinsella in which the original novel, Ray has a twin brother named Richard, which was cut from the film. Another fault of the writing is how Hippie this movie is. The Kinsellas are shown to have been very liberal hippie-types in their youth. Baseball seem more conservative than liberal, since 75% of all political donations from teams, team executives and owners went right rather than left. The whole movie seem to have this oddly politic undertones. It's no surprise that the movie is indeed set in Iowa, a key political caucuses. I think the movie should had focus, less about politics. Another criticism leveled at the film is that apparently baseball is just as segregated in the afterlife as it was in the real-life early 20th century. It's nice to have James Earl Jones in the film, but who wouldn't love to see a Jackie Robinson or Monte Irwin cameo. Still, the movie screenplay was good enough to be nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. It should had won, in my opinion. The film was also nominated for Best Picture that year, and the way, the movie is shot, shows why. It was beautiful to watch. The field itself was built on two separate properties to allow for uninhibited sunset shots. The movie seems to glow. Add, James Horner's beautiful score and you got a movie that just easy to the eyes and ears. For a PG movie, there is a few language and mild thematic elements, but nothing too bad, even compare today's standards. Overall: A great movie to watch with the family. So catch it!",Field of Dreams
36,slightlymad22,A Timeless Classic,10,13 August 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to 1989's Field Of Dreams. Plot In A Paragraph: Ray Kinsella (KC) an Iowa corn farmer, starts hearing voices, he interprets them as a request to build a baseball diamond in his crop field.Is this heaven?? I don't like baseball, never have had even the slightest interest in the game, so why do I cry like a baby every time I watch Field Of Dreams?? I will admit from the off, I am bias. I love this movie. It is not just one of my favourite KC movies, it's not just my favourite movie of 1989 (and in a year that featured Last Crusade, Lethal Weapon 2, Batman, Back To The Future 2, Dead Poets Society and the classic Weekend At Bernie's, you know how high that praise is) one of my favourite movies of the 1980's, it's one of my favourite movies in general.KC, Amy Madigan, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster are all perfect. Everything about this movie is perfect, not just the casting, the performances, the screenplay, the directing, the atmosphere and the score all knock it out of the park (yes pun intended again) I will deliberately avoid talking about the movies ending (so I don't ruin it for those who have not seen it) but I cried like a baby when I seen it in 1990, and I have cried every time I have watched it since, and I watch it a couple of times a year. It doesn't matter if I sit and watch it all, or catch the last twenty minutes on TV, I will be in floods of tears. If I'm not already crying, the way KC's voice breaks, will do it!! EVERY TIME. I read somewhere that the best motion pictures find meaning in not aspects of the story but rather in the underlying emotional core and heart that defines the story. Field Of Dreams is a perfect example of that saying. It's no surprise that Field Of Dreams is still entertaining and touching people regularly today (it plays regularly on TV in the UK) more than 25 years after its release. A timeless classic. 10/10 for this reviewer.",Field of Dreams
37,didi-5,not your usual baseball movie,7,1 May 2004,"This film could so easily have become 'Field of Corn'; the fact that it didn't is a tribute to the talents of director Phil Alden Robinson, and cast members Kevin Costner (as the guy who builds a baseball field and calls up Shoeless Joe, a player from the past, and eventually comes to terms with his own family troubles at the same time), James Earl Jones (as tetchy writer Terence Mann), and Burt Lancaster (as the jovial gentleman Dr Grahame).What we have is a plot which, ok, is a bit hard to swallow - especially once a whole ghostly baseball match is created with two complete teams - but it is so well-written you don't quibble with the realities of the Kinsella's situation.  It is a fairly touching film without being crushed under the sentimentality that could have so easily crept in.",Field of Dreams
38,zkonedog,The Greatest Baseball Movie Ever Made,10,8 March 2017,"When it comes to baseball, the National Pastime is probably the most romantic of all the major sports. Because of its long, rich history and the fact that is has been passed down from generation to generation, it is shrouded in a sort of mysticism/nostalgia that gives the sport a sort of romantic glean. ""Field of Dreams"" takes full advantage of this mystique to create the greatest baseball stories ever told.For a basic plot summary, the movie tells the story of Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner), an Iowa corn farmer who begins hearing voices out in the cornfield. These voices, to the chagrin of wife Annie (Amy Madigan), tell Ray to build a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield in order to bring back the ghost of Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta). In the face of deep financial peril, Ray builds the field and holds onto the dream, along the way bringing in famous 1960s writer Terence Mann (James Earl Jones) and Archie ""Moonlight"" Graham (Burt Lancaster) to share in the incredible experience.This film has a solid plot and great acting. Every scene means something (a credit to director Phil Robinson), and the plot builds to an extraordinary climax. However, it is the emotion of the experience that makes it an all-time classic. Baseball can create a strong bond between fathers & sons, families, and friends, and ""Field of Dreams"" is absolutely perfect at creating a rich tapestry of emotion. I don't care how ""tough"" you are or how emotionally reserved you may be...if this one can't touch you, then you might want to check to make sure you aren't a robot.Overall, I consider ""Field of Dreams"" to be the greatest baseball movie ever made. It truly ""gets"" the concept of the romantic, nostalgic side of baseball, and adds such heaping amounts of emotion that one can't help but get sucked into the whole experience. In terms of ""greatest single scenes"" in Hollywood history, the ending of this flick is perhaps my favorite ever. Pure, raw emotion at its very finest.",Field of Dreams
39,digitalbeachbum,I'm biased,9,14 April 2020,"I grew up eating, sleeping and living baseball. I loved the game. I would have played for food money. I loved the smell of spring training in Florida and going to the games with my pops. He would pull me out of school so we could go see games. The Yankees, Phillies, Dodgers, Reds, Cardinals, Astros, and The Cubs.I played through high school and played later in The USMC. I switched to softball but it was purely because of logistics of what was being offered, but I still went to the games in the spring and watched them on television.This movie is about that, the love for the game. It is about this idea that baseball is more than just a game. It is a national pastime for America. It is baseball, hotdogs and apple pie.Sure, building a baseball field in the middle of Iowa is fantasy, but that's not the point. The point of the script is about the connection between a father and his son through baseball.This movie is a classic for all baseball lovers.",Field of Dreams

43,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,1 December 2016,"I loved this movie when I was a kid. It came out when I was 9 and like so many other Kevin Costner movies, it became one of my all time favorites.I can still remember seeing it in the theater.It's right up there with ""Bull Durham,"" only it seems like it's on the far opposite of the coin. ""Bull Durham"" took baseball and more specifically baseball fans and poked fun at us. It teased us for loving the game the same way that older sibling or favorite uncle that you looked up to teased you about your own eccentricities. Never in a mean or hostile way, but in a familial closeness.""Field of Dreams"" takes the opposite stance. Instead of lovingly mocking us for loving baseball, it tells the audience why fans can make the sport an obsession.It illustrates how it brings families together. How a simple game of catch creates a father and son bond. It shows its audience how the game transcends generations and, in a way, shows people why freaks like me rent apartments across the street from softball diamonds, just so, when the weather's warm, we can walk across the street and watch a game...or, when we are stuck inside working, we can crack open a window and listen to the familiar and comforting sounds.Even if you don't play there is something almost...I don't know--would angelic be strong enough?--magical? wonderful? there is something to that sound a bad makes when it hits a ball. Especially when it's followed by yells and cheers.It's something that you don't get when you go to Wrigley Field or when you watch the game on television. But you play a game, you go to the cages, you start hitting up your local high school games and you get to hear that clink, the cheers, that rush of excitement that makes you stand up in your seat and start yelling too.""Field of Dreams"" explains all of that, right down to the few stolen hours between twilight and darkness children get to enjoy when they sneak to the backyard after dinner and play catch until they can't see the ball any more.And right there, to go along with it, the movie is about magic too.It's almost as good as the game itself.",Field of Dreams
44,ianlouisiana,The Catcher In The Corn,9,17 November 2005,"Is life like baseball?Well,as a Brit I'm not really qualified to say,but it certainly isn't much like football or cricket so perhaps this obsession with sport as metaphor is peculiarly an American thing.The mythic aspect of baseball last explored in ""The Natural""is turned into the metaphysical in ""Field of dreams"" where Iowan farmer Kevin Costner,having heard a mysterious voice in his head,instead of checking in for a full physical builds a baseball diamond in his cornfield.Gradually the field fills with old - time players including his father with whom it is fair to say he had not enjoyed a cordial relationship.Resolving this situation would be enough for most movies but ""Field of dreams"" adds a Salinger - like recluse, an ex-pro turned doctor who has been dead for 40 odd years and still make a cohesive whole from all these parts - a very impressive achievement. James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster add dignity and depth to what might otherwise be a feature-length episode of ""Quantum Leap"". The scene where Lancaster unhesitatingly runs from the field to save Costner's daughter's life knowing he can never go back is finely done. Male values hardly dare speak their name nowadays but they are celebrated here,and the father - son relationship ,just as prickly and sensitive as its female equivalent,is given an unususally close examination. There are many memorable moments.Kevin and his dad knock the ball around under the floodlights,the players appear and disappear through the long corn stalks,car headlights stretching far off into the distance at the end.One of the players,gazing round in awe asks Costner ""Is this Heaven?"",""No"",he replies,""It's Iowa"". Well,you can believe that if you want to.",Field of Dreams
45,dee.reid,I love this movie! 10/10,10,13 August 2003,"I first saw ""Field of Dreams"" once when I was a about four or five years old and never saw it again.  Then last year, ""Dreams"" was being shown on Encore and I was able to grab hold of the last 20 of the movie.  So I rented it and watched it and loved it.  Now, just today I watched it again, and the feeling is the same: I love this movie!Kevin Costner stars as Ray Kinsella, an Iowa corn farmer who one day hears a spiritual request to build a baseball field in his corn crop.  He is supported by his wife, Annie (Amy Madigan) and young daughter, Karin (Gaby Hoffman).  So Ray gets to work.  Not long goes by when the great ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta), as well as several other of professional baseball's greats begin appearing on the field.  Ray is also joined by a disillusioned and embittered former writer, Terrance Mann (James Earl Jones).This is a great film that is timeless.  Even 13 years after its release, this movie is still batting a thousand, touching the lives of people who view it.  I was really touched by Costner's performance.  He had a sort of falling out with his father when he was a kid, and never had a chance to reconcile.  It kind of reminds me of my relationship with my father. Though, the circumstances are no where near as severe as Costner's (my father is still alive and I still talk to him), but it's still generally affecting.  The appeal of this movie is that it can be watched over and over.  I'm not big on baseball, but it's clear of the effect that baseball has on some people.  It's America's pasttime and for some, a religion.  There are so many greats who played the game, that for every ball hit or thrown, their spirit continues living on in the game.  Though I guess, that's one of the movie's biggest attributes: That baseball greats like Joe Jackson and Archibald Graham would have a chance to play again, even after their deaths.I love this movie and it's definitely in my top 50.  Watch and enjoy!",Field of Dreams
46,mjneu59,saccharine daydream leaves a sour aftertaste,3,17 November 2010,"No wonder it's a hit: this slick, simplistic fantasy is nothing less than the perfect bedtime story for George Bush's kinder, gentler nation. Ex-college radical turned man-of-the-soil Kevin Costner hears a voice in the wilderness telling him to build a baseball diamond in his Iowa cornfield, where the ghosts of baseball legend (invisible to Costner's jaded neighbors) come to play, all because the guy never played catch with his dad. The film is built entirely on surface gloss and wide-eyed, thirty-something wonderment, offering a sanitized version of small town America, baseball lore, and filial devotion, all of it dripping with enough conservative virtue and honey-coated sentiment to make even Frank Capra blush. Costner's farmer has even been compared elsewhere in print to the biblical Noah, who at least was generous enough not to charge admission to the Ark the way Costner (with true 1980s entrepreneurial spirit) does to his magical baseball diamond in order to save the family farm. All the New Age pop karma in the world can't disguise the problematic writing and shallow characters, and the entire cast wanders through the film in a state of hypnotic bliss.",Field of Dreams
47,jimbo-53-186511,I didn't think much of it and don't really understand all the praise it receives,4,27 May 2019,"Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) repeatedly hears a voice out in his field that tells him ""If you build it he will come."" Kinsella eventually learns that the voice is telling him to build a baseball diamond and before long the diamond is built and Chicago White Sox player Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) appears on the field and is soon accompanied by the other Chicago White Sox players who were banned from the 1919 game. From the moment Ray hears this voice, he finds himself on a voyage of self-discovery which involves travelling across various parts of America...Field of Dreams is a nice idea and I'm all for a bit of escapism, but no matter how much I tried I simply could not get into this film. It doesn't really help that the material itself is rather thin and I also never felt Kinsella's pain in the way that I presumably was supposed to - this was probably due to a combination of Costner's unconvincing performance and the paper thin script.The real problem I think with this film is its general lack of spark; despite the fantasy element it just isn't all that interesting and I soon found myself not caring what it was doing or where it was going. The idea of Kinsella's wife going along with his crack-pot scheme to build a baseball field without much objection was also a stretch in credibility (especially as it is only Ray that can hear the voice). There is also a sub-plot involving the family potentially losing their farm and home which doesn't add a great deal of weight to the film and just seems to get in the way whenever the film begins to gather momentum.There's the odd moment dotted around here and there that works (although for me the best moments come when James Earl Jones and Kevin Costner share the screen together) and I'd be lying if I didn't say that the finale wasn't quite moving. However, there's just too much here for me that didn't work and for the most part I found Field of Dreams to be flat and fairly uninvolving.",Field of Dreams

50,slokes,Squeeze Play,4,28 August 2010,"""Field Of Dreams"" is a clumsy, mawkish movie I'd dislike less if it didn't press its touchy-feely points so hard.Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) is out in his Iowa cornfield when he hears a voice telling him ""If you build it, he will come."" He knows what this means and levels much of his desperately-needed corn crop to create a baseball diamond. Soon a long-dead baseball player with a stained past arrives to hit a few with Ray. But Ray's journey is only beginning...Fantasy is not a genre where everything is supposed to make sense; you have to allow for some room to wonder. ""Field Of Dreams"" has a killer concept that it springs on you in the first minute. That famous mystical maxim, ""If you build it, he will come"" is actually heard in the movie before anyone else says a line of dialogue. It then dials in to make an overarching statement about baseball, suggesting that a love of the game can restore the innocence of a broken nation, and a connection with a departed father.The result is a film people either love, hate, or feel totally indifferent about. I used to love this film, but feel indifferent to it now. For me, some admittedly positive sentiment is worn down by iffy dialogue, protracted ""big scenes"", and a couple of weak central performances.Costner is so wrong for his role it defies imagination. ""I am the least crazy person I've ever known,"" he says, and it's true. He's so level-headed and quiet it's hard to accept the notion of his Kinsella character throwing over his life to a voice in the wind. He drives all the way to Boston, risking his farm, to beg reclusive author Terence Mann (James Earl Jones) to come with him to a ball game, acting the whole time more sheepish than zealous about the whole thing.Amy Madigan's performance as Ray's wife Annie suffers from a terminal case of the cutes, partly a fault of the atrocious dialogue (""What if the voice calls when you're gone?"") but also from her tendency to mug in every scene. The film seems to suffer from a similar problem. When Ray tells a shopful of skeptical farmers about the voice, the radio is playing ""Crazy"". When we see him leveling the crop to build the field, the camera cuts to neighbors parked in cars three-deep watching him and rhubarbing lines like ""I can't believe it"".The movie is never exactly bad. It moves fast and scores its emotional points, however thickly. John Lindley's camera maximizes the impact of skyscapes and corn fields. James Earl Jones carves out a crafty role for himself as Mann. We are told early on how very, very important a writer Mann is back in the 1960s (he even coined the phrase ""Make Love, Not War"", Annie announces at one point, which I guess is supposed to show his Pulitzer-winning genius at work), yet Jones makes his strongest impression drawing smart laughs in a film that badly needs them.Writer-director Phil Alden Robinson seems to want to present baseball as a worthy substitute for conventional religious belief (twice we hear the Q&A ""Is this Heaven?/No, it's Iowa."") but the film's theology seems pretty hollow at its core. Baseball is a fun sport, okay, but is hanging around playing pepper with a bunch of dead All-Stars the best an afterlife can offer? Is the Field's ultimate function that of a self-funding tourist trap drawing pocket money from nostalgic baby boomers wanting to see the players their grandparents grew up with?""Field Of Dreams"" once moved me a good deal, but doesn't score so well anymore. It squeezes too hard and offers too little.",Field of Dreams
51,aharmas,This story is a diamond,9,2 September 2012,"""Field of Dreams"" works on faith, and with the help of a director who can evoke nostalgia, paint with emotions, generate magic from visuals, expressions, and single lines. The film shows a different scenario, but it is the story of believing in something regardless of the logic behind the dream, the yearning, the impulse. Here is a man who ""hears voices"", and through the power of film, we are in the position to see that it's not madness. It's a more powerful force, and the mystery is trying to find out where this is all going.Ray Kinsella (Costner) is asked to build a baseball field, to clear his corn fields and wait for some type of result, and it must be a leap of faith. Soon, his family, friends, and the community start wondering about his sanity. Eventually, the field is up, and a stream of visitors arrive, but as it usually happens in this type of movies. Only a selected few can see these apparitions, and there is more at the heart of Kinsella's following directions. The ""voice"" continues to throw hints, and the mystery deepens.There are many seasoned actors here, and each plays his/her part perfectly. Madigan is powerful as the supporting spouse, simple and complex at the same time. She struggles to find how far she must go, and she's not afraid to voice her concerns and/or her emotions. In later scenes we see Ray Liotta playing a famous baseball figure with regrets of his own, and it's his entrance that takes this film into a genre that is rarely successful in the big screen, but it works very well here. As the messages continue, we visit other figures in history, past and present, and sentimentality mixes in with skepticism, with mystery, as the quest to the ultimate discovery goes on, we learn more about Kinsella and ourselves.Some scenes in ""Field of Dreams"" are amazing, as the title indicates, it's all about the dreams of many, and since those are people, they might even somehow mirror some of our hopes, too. Metaphors abound here as family members have an opportunity to revisit their relationships and see what really matters while we are on this planet. This is a rare film, and it barely misses achieving perfection, but it comes close because of the fine talent involved. It never deteriorates into a cheap soap opera or a flight of fancy.

53,ShootingShark,Heartwarming Fantasy Of Lowly Farmer Encountering Mystical Forces,7,27 June 2011,"Ray Kinsella is a farmer in Iowa who hears a mysterious voice in his head telling him to build a baseball field in his corn. Unable to resist, he does, and soon a troupe of ghostly players, led by the legendary Shoeless Joe Jackson, show up and start playing. What does it mean, and what will happen next ?This is a lovely gentle fantasy about following your heart, the choices we all make in life and how redemption may come in an unusual guise. It's also pure Americana - the lovely open spaces of the Midwest, the echoes of the sixties counter culture which drove wedges between many children and their parents, and of course the central metaphor of baseball as the true icon of US culture. It's also a lovingly crafted old-style of a movie - you could imagine Frank Capra and James Stewart making it in the forties - about an ordinary guy who follows his heart and puts his trust in strangers, even when it's crazy to do so. When Ray is asked if this is heaven, and he looks at the beautiful countryside and his wife and daughter sitting on the porch, the answer is obvious. It's maybe a little schmaltzy but who cares - the emotions and the characters ring true, and it keeps coming up with fine scenes and funny moments, as well as a fabulous payoff when we finally realise the true point to all Ray's endeavours. It has a terrific cast, whose performances seem effortless and make us believe everything we're seeing without question - Jones' ""people will come"" speech is an amazing soliloquy, and for my money Lancaster (in his penultimate film) completely steals the picture as Moonlight Graham, the small town doctor who never quite made it to the big leagues. There's also an amazing score by James Horner which seems to instantly make everyone weep with happiness, and dreamy gorgeous location photography by John Lindley shot in Dubuque County in eastern Iowa. This is a proper movie experience, full of love, mystery, comedy and drama, the kind of film which sweeps you along and you don't want to end. It's beautiful. Written by the director and based on the bestselling book Shoeless Joe, by W.P. Kinsella.

57,richard-1787,One very sad movie,7,19 October 2013,"I saw this movie when it first came out, and I loved it.Now, 20-some years later, I was very much bothered by the end.You realize, when Ray Kensella finally meets his father as a young man on the baseball field, that what makes his father so happy now, with a happiness his son never got to see, is that he has finally gotten to realize his young man's dreams, dreams that most men have to sacrifice to have an adult life. (That seems to be the case with the writer as well, and certainly with the doctor.) It suggests that men sacrifice their most cherished dreams to support a wife and children, and that a man's most cherished aspirations are those he has when he's young.I suspect that is often the case, but I find it a sad idea.So those cars that we see streaming toward the farm at the end of the movie must all be full of middle-aged and older men who have come to relive the fantasies they gave up to support a wife and family.That's just one very sad theme. I'm not saying that it's not true. But it's one very sad theme.",Field of Dreams
58,FlushingCaps,A little magic + a little baseball = a great film,10,19 October 2009,"My wife and I just saw this on DVD, having seen the film a few times before. I read the novel ""Shoeless Joe"" before the movie came out and thought it excellent. Somehow, this movie grows on me. I liked it better on this viewing than ever before.The negative reviewers seem to have missed the purpose of building the field, which was explained by Ray before he started building the field. He continued on despite the problems because he believed he ""had"" to.I think you can argue that the movie is better than the novel, even though large portions are omitted from the film. The PTA scene greatly filled out Annie's role over the novel.One line I loved that rarely gets mentioned, is when Ray is building the field, explaining some baseball history to his daughter. He asks ""How can you explain...(about Jackson's role in the 1919 Scandal)"" and she answers, ""I can't"" as though he really expected her to explain it. This film was filled with all sorts of great lines, most famously led by James Earl Jones' speech near the end, which is one of the great speeches in movie history, in my mind.To anyone who obtains the DVD, I most highly recommend watching the many extras about making the movie, including the articles about the real life hero Doc Graham actually was in Chisholm, Minnesota. Collectively, these extras were the best I've ever seen on a DVD.As for the negative critics--I don't understand why you would point out little, factual negatives about a movie that was most definitely light-hearted, fun, whimsical, magical, etc. I do not believe these negatives come close to overcoming the many joys this film delivers.As an aside, I also urge anyone to visit the filming locations near Dyersville, Iowa. If you forget to bring your glove and ball, don't worry, they will LEND you (no charge) what you need to ""have a catch"". It is a wonderful place to visit after seeing the movie.",Field of Dreams
59,RNMorton,Almost Instant Baseball Classic,9,1 April 2005,"Fantasy seems to work well the American pastime. In this one Costner hears voices and plows under part of his crop to build a ballpark in the middle of Iowa. I am most definitely NOT a Costner fan but I can't deny the magic in this film. Like all great cinema, portions of this film stay with me like I lived it myself. I enjoy Burt Lancaster and the twists involving his character the most, as well as seeing some old-time baseball (actually, I could have used a little more baseball and a little less of the rest). This is good enough to ignore the flaws, including a right-handed Joe Jackson with an IQ twice the real one, an unnecessary financial crisis and an overdone finale. But how many movies have a killer Ty Cobb joke? Very effective musical score that gets me choked up on cue.",Field of Dreams
60,KnightsofNi11,"Should have been good, but it's not",5,5 August 2011,"If you're looking for a sappy and generally unintelligible film then Field of Dreams has got you covered. If you like realistic and rationale films that have a coherent purpose to them then I would steer clear of this one. Field of Dreams is about Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella who starts to hear voices in his corn field that tell him to build a baseball diamond. Rather than go to a doctor, Ray immediately spends his families savings on building the diamond, an action that his wife is perfectly fine with for some strange reason. After building the diamond, Shoeless Joe Jackson and other deceased White Sox players show up and start to play. Yet the voices keep returning to Ray and they send him on a journey to find his true purpose in life in a story that tries to be so heartwarming but is really all a bunch of warm fuzzy nonsense filled with sap and cheese.When Field of Dreams starts it offers up a very promising storyline with some interesting character dynamics that should have carried very well through the film. Then the film gets rolling and Ray immediately starts hearing the voices and immediately decides to listen to them. His overzealous spontaneity was the first thing that made my head turn in this movie. Then there was his wife's nonchalant reaction to Ray's bold actions and I felt I was slipping further and further into a Hollywood sap story filled with easy solution and simple coincidence that feels all too imaginary. The rest of the film played out like this. Every major issue or conflict was solved through practically nothing. I felt like the characters only interacted with each other the way they did in order to progress the story, not because it was realistic or human.Things got even worse when the people who were against Ray's actions started to dish out the more convincing arguments. Ray's brother-in-law, Mark, spends the whole film trying to convince Ray to stop his madness or else he's going to go bankrupt. When his pleas fail he then begins to urge Ray to sell his house before the bank forecloses. He's made out to be such a bad guy and yet I sort of found myself on his side. Ray is here risking his livelihood because he hears voices and sees ghosts. In any rationale situation a person like this wouldn't even be allowed to own a house. But Field of Dreams tries so damn hard to cram it's irritating message of ""follow your dreams"" and ""do what feels right"" down our throats that we're supposed to feel sorry for the lunatic. It's a dynamic that just doesn't work and it irritates me to no end when a film treats me like I'm stupid and can't rationalize for myself.Of course, let's take a step back here. I probably sound like a maniac ranting about my searing hatred for this film. But the fact of the matter is that I don't downright hate Field of Dreams, I just have some major issues with it and a few strong words against it. This film, in all of it's irrationality does have its moments of clarity and quality. There are great performances all around with starts like Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones, and Ray Liotta, and the dialogue is very smooth and well written, even when the content of it is silly and ridiculous.Field of Dreams isn't a very good film, but it definitely had the potential to be great if a little more time had been put towards fleshing out the logic and rationale of the film. It's made out to be an inspiring story of a man with such powerful ambitions who only wants to follow his dreams and his heart, but when you boil it down it is the ramblings of a mad man. If this film had ended with Kevin Costner waking up in a straitjacket and padded room, baseball cards strewn about the floor it would have been pure genius. But alas, it ends as sappy as it began. I won't spoil it but there's not much to spoil. I won't be watching this film again.",Field of Dreams

In my opinion,this is Kevin Costner's finest work,though he has spent the better part of the last several years trying to escape the image the public has created for him as a result of the film.It(the role of Ray Kinsella) has become the role people most identify him with.As for my view of the film,it is basically about second chances,and about handling things differently the second time around.We in the real world of course can't go back,so we reach for this film to make ourselves feel better.Look for a flawless performance,as always,from James Earl Jones.Highly recommended.",Field of Dreams

63,rebeljenn,a film for midwestern American baseball fans,2,22 November 2005,"'Field of Dreams' was a film made for the midwest American traditional family who love tradition, a conservative lifestyle, and good old American sport: baseball. While 'Field of Dreams' is imaginative and original in a story and as a film, it did not quite do it for me. (I suppose that is because I am female and I dislike sport, and since the film is mainly about baseball and dreams becoming a big baseball star, I had trouble relating to the character. I think this was the primary focus of the film: the farmer who turns his cornfield into a playing field to be visited by the ghosts of the great players.) Now, while I do think the film was imaginative and brought about an emotional and engaging story for some, others found it less enjoyable. I would even suggest that it is over-rated, but I'm not so sure. This film has seemed to have filled a needed void in film subjects about dreams and baseball. If you're into that sort of thing, you will love the film. If you're like me and you don't like sports and don't know a thing about baseball, then you will be disappointed and bored. I would recommend it to a certain specific audience, which I mentioned, but I would think that those outside this audience would find the film mediocre and would not understand what all the fuss is about. It's not for everyone.",Field of Dreams
64,esteban1747,Good for those who like baseball,8,28 July 2003,"Although living in Italy, I am and will be a baseball fan forever, that's why I have seen this film several times, which is a good fantasy and tries to bring back all those players banned in the famous scandal of the 1919 World Series when the White Sox was defeated unbelievable by the Cincinnati Reds. After that scandal eight players were banned, among them the famous Joe ""shoeless"" Jackson, here badly played by Ray Liotta. I am saying this because the director, Phil Alden Robinson, used Liotta throwing left and batting right when Jackson used to do these things the other way around. The fantasy starts when Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) decided to build a baseball stadium in his own corn field, he did not have money so his option was to sell the farm and the stadium or to keep them but provided that money will come finally. Then in his dreams he decided to contact the retired writer Terence Mann (played by James Earl Jones) and from here a physician who used to play one MLB baseball game in 1905 with NY Giants, Dr. Archibald 'Moonlight' Graham (played by Burt Lancaster), but never went to bat. When Kinsella came back home he found that various players were already playing there among them Mel Ott, Gil Hodges and several others, and not only the famous eight ""Black Sox"", and also his father, who wanted in the past to become a baseball player. Kinsella found that many fans were coming to his stadium to see all these former stars playing there, something that solved his economical problems. I think that Kevin Costner is the best baseball fan among the cinema actors in Hollywood, he has only one competitor, Charlie Sheen.",Field of Dreams
65,Dan1863Sickles,"Read The Book, It's So Much Better!",6,21 July 2021,"I read SHOELESS JOE by W. P. Kinsella when it first came out, as a young Marine in 1988. I found it to be MUCH better than this movie. The book is light, fun, playful, full of warmth but never takes itself too seriously. The movie is slow, dull, self-important and strangely inert, with a lot of dull, empty scenes and some strident Sixties posturing that has nothing to do with the book's exploration of baseball.When I look back now, I think the movie's problems have to do with bad casting as much as anything else. James Earl Jones is a titanic legend as an actor, but he's never been much of a comic talent. The fact that his character is supposed to be funny is something the movie fails to grasp. In the movie the writer is basically a dull, painfully uptight straight man -- and he's a straight man to Kevin Costner, who is a dreamy leading man but again, not exactly Groucho Marx in the humor department.In the book the hero is much more whimsical, and takes an almost playful attitude towards his impossible quest. The movie is painfully serious. In the book the hero adores his wife Annie, who is more sweet and loving rather than shrill and aggressive, which is how Amy Madigan plays her in the film. (Maybe she thought she was acting in another Biker stomp-movie, like STREETS OF FIRE.)This book is definitely fun, and enjoyable, and I would recommend it to anyone. One thing I didn't like was the way baseball is promoted constantly -- not as a fun pastime, or even a character-building sport, but literally as a substitute religion that will replace Christianity. Now no-one has more skepticism about religion than I do, but I don't think baseball can replace the Bible, any more than baseball can replace calculus. Kinsella would have had a better book if he had limited the anti-religious theme, or at least acknowledged his own bias and let it go at that.",Field of Dreams
66,emm,A winning home-run for Kevin Costner.,8,9 January 1999,"Seems as though we've watched one movie too many that deals with baseball! FIELD OF DREAMS is not your simple run-of-the-mill baseball flick, but it delivers a strong sense of fantasy and redemption that shines above the rest. This is a rewarding, inventive use of storytelling that is to be experienced. The most deeply involving point of the movie is Costner, while on the search for the past, must intentionally fight to keep the baseball diamond or lose his property. It is a movie designed to fulfill anyone's true wishes, and it does offer some occasional laughs abound. Take your pick at this one or BULL DURHAM. It's among the very best out of Kevin Costner, who should have made himself a trademark icon to the entire sport of baseball!",Field of Dreams
67,bigverybadtom,Maybe If You're A Baseball Fanatic,3,10 October 2021,"Kevin Costner plays a farmer who is told by a disembodied voice to build a baseball field in the middle of his cornfield. Does he see a doctor, which anyone else would have done? No, he actually somehow gets all the construction materials and builds the field right in the middle of his cropland at great expense, causing himself and his family financial hardship. Ghosts of Shoeless Joe Jackson and other baseball players from ancient times appear and play in the stadium, and after that, the farmer and his wife has to go from Iowa to Boston to pick up an embittered reclusive novelist and bring him with them. Eventually, lots of people come to this baseball field as the voice promised, and the farmer meets the ghost of his late father who had been a baseball fanatic.This movie was based on a ""magic realism"" novel, but the big problem is, what is the point of the movie? Why build the baseball stadium on a working farm? Who was behind the voice and why does the farmer simply blindly obey it? And what's all the fuss over Shoeless Joe Jackson anyway, as a player who ended his career based on his own willing criminal activity? When you think about it, baseball isn't even America's most popular sport-football is. Let me know if there is a movie about Walter Payton sometime-he was a much better character anyway.",Field of Dreams
68,khatcher-2,Whimsical nostalgia builds fairy-story pipe-dream,4,7 November 2003,"Apart from the fact that it was nice to see James Earl Jones again, if only from a nostalgic sense because of his sensitive and sympathetic reading of Stephen Kumalo in the South African classic telling of Alan Paton's `Cry, the Beloved Country' (1995), `Field of Dreams' is not much more than a heart-warming desireful trot down some kind of Memory Lane, the strongest point in its favour residing in what it does not have: it does not have any steamy sex scenes, and there is not any violence. Which makes quite a change and makes a symbolic if insipid incursion into fairy-tale land.For us non-Americans who cannot tell the difference between Chicago Black Sox, Memphis Grizzlies or the Philadelphia Eagles, and also lack cultural grounding in the mythological and legendary players who have peopled the fields of great stadiums, the story coming out of this film is nothing more than a fantasy caprice in a minor key, a sweetened excursion into fanciful illusion. Such is the magic of cinema.So that it works, the trick is not to indulge too heavily in trying to out-do oneself, something at which Kevin Costner has earnestly tried his hand in several films but perhaps nowhere more than in this little entertainment for wishful dreamers. Perhaps the trip into non-reality might involve praiseworthy concepts, but one certainly missed a whole column of disclaimers in the end credits. The apparent evadism as fundamental pivot to the whole film, embodies the basic concept of what the `Great American Dream' was supposed to have been and which suffered a grave miscarriage somewhere down the line. Upon such vague notions a mighty nation was born. Hmmmmmmm........I must have missed something somewhere.",Field of Dreams
69,LebowskiT1000,Kevin Costner at his best!!!,9,15 January 2003,"This truly is an excellent film.  Every time I watch this film I am reminded how well done it is.  The story is truly original and quite odd, but that seems to be what makes the best stories isn't it.  I even find myself getting a little misty-eyed at certain scenes in the film, and if you've already seen it then you'll probably know what I'm talking about.  There are a number of scenes that are quite touching.The characters are so well done in all aspects.  Ray Kinsella, Anni Kinsella, Karin Kinsella, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Terence Mann, Archie Graham (old and young), and everyone else are incredibly well done and a delight to watch.The cast in this film is nothing less than perfect.  Kevin Costner pulls off one of his best performances to date.  James Earl Jones is as excellent as always.  Ray Liotta pulled off the role of Joe Jackson perfectly!  Gaby Hoffman was a treat to see a such a young age. Timothy Busfield, Burt Lancaster, Frank Whaley and Amy Madigan are all exceptional actors as well and deserve notice for their work in this film.  A superb cast!I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that likes Baseball, Father-and-Son movies, fantasy/drama films, or just about anything.  This is a film for everyone to enjoy.  If you are one of the few people out there that hasn't seen this film, do yourself a favor and give it a watch, you just might enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Field of Dreams

Alicia will think i have a girlfriend!""",7,6 December 2017,"Everybody at one time comes this close to their dreams and figures they will have another chance or another day to capture that dream. But that day may never come. This movie hits me personally on all levels. My love of baseball. My love of history and most importantly my love of family. Vividly photographed in rural Iowa accompanied by a beautiful music score, Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) hears a voice that inspires him to build a baseball field removing some valuable acreage to the confusion of neighboring farmers. Ray who claims that he never did anything so spontaneous in his entire life, follows the voice of ""If you build it he will come."" Ray Constructs a ball field explaining to his young daughter Karin (Gabby Hoffman) about the 1919 White Sox scandal and the plight of their star player ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson. Wife Annie (Amy Madigan) goes along with her husband on this construction. Time goes by. Then a visit from ""Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) in full 1919 White Sox attire. A book Banning meeting awakens the idea of Ray to travel to Boston to find Terence Mann, popular fictitious writer, (James Earl Jones). Ray with a bit of trouble takes Mr. Mann to a Red Sox game. A name appears on the scoreboard. Ray takes off for Minnesota with Terence Mann in tow in search of Archie ""Moonlight"" Graham played by well renown actor Burt Lancaster. As I stated earlier My love of History with all the old time ball players coming to life surrounded by a cornfield hearing Doc Graham recounting his one chance in the majors many decades ago. Doc Graham tags along as a youth in the form of (James Whaley). When everyone arrives back at the farm The bank threatens to foreclose on the farm unless Ray signs the papers from his brother-in-law Mark, (Timothy Busfield). More miracles to follow in this love of baseball and family. I personally enjoyed Terence Mann's moving speech about the people will come to see the game. One of my favorite scenes is the night game showing the old time players throwing the ball around to lazy ragtime music only James Horner could provide. I understand why this movie didn't win an Academy Award. You have to have the love of baseball to truly appreciate this movie. In this fast paced short attention spanned environment newer generations find baseball a bit slow and boring. To me Baseball is like a fine glass of vintage to be savored on a warm summer night. Not rushed or spoiled. Another thing to mention about this cathartic tale is the final crescendo of emotion as Ray realizes why he went through this journey. As I watch the final scene I think to myself and ponder that someday I'll travel to Iowa and walk upon that ball field among-st the corn and wait to see my Paternal grandfather, ""WILLIE"" enter the playing field. I would say in a shaky voice, ""Hey Grandpa . You want to have a catch?""",Field of Dreams

72,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Ugh, it's no wonder this is George W. Bush's favourite film",5,13 August 2006,"...because it is so chock-full of all-American clichés and bad writing that it is nearly unwatchable. Now, I have nothing against American films or people for that matter (there are many of both categories that I love), but Field of Dreams takes patriotism too far and carves out cheesy clichés after another to cheaply appeal to its people: baseball legends, heroes, the American dream, Kevin Costner, faith, the all-American dad, tearjerking moments -- such peachy writing it makes me ill.'Nearly unwatchable' is a strong word and perhaps unjustly applied to this film because, in truth, I have sat through it at least twice and cried one of the times. So it is fair to say that I tripped over its emotional devices and fell into the sentimental trap at the end. But this aside, is it a good film? No, not really. Kevin Costner is too static in his role as Ray Kinsella, the corny dialogue makes itself heard throughout the story and to non-Americans, the inherent clichés are borderline cringeworthy.Field of Dreams is a pretty moronic stinking film, which I suspect is why Bush likes it so much. The only way that I can watch it is if I completely shut out all American stereotypes and just view it as a straightforward sports story - but this is nearly impossible, especially since it's supposedly very historically inaccurate. It gets a passable grade - mediocre.5/10",Field of Dreams
73,willcundallreview,A magic journey of realisation,8,22 February 2015,"Rating-8/10Field of Dreams is a sports fantasy movie that has gone down as one of the best baseball movies ever made, and its not hard to see why. It has heart, it has true emotion and the people behind the scenes do as much as they can to not only draw you in to the scene, but also bring you closer to the characters involved. It's a mysterious movie, constantly unravelling before your eyes and you end up by the end having a lovely after taste, if movies can give you one that is. I mean it doesn't have the best start in movies but over time progresses to a level any film maker or producer would be proud of, it's timing is done to perfection and the plot just keeps you guessing. It's written beautifully as well and the script is just one of the highlights done by director including writer of the movie Phil Alden Robinson who seems to not only have an eye to get the most emotion out of an adapted book, but also the heart.Kevin Costner is the captain of the ship that is the movie and he steadies it well, he isn't perfect by any stretch but is far far away from being poor, a good show all round from him. I really liked James Earl Jones who has some of the best lines and also best scenes, him and Costner work beautifully together and you truly feel for his character and what he feels and whatever he chooses to do next.The extra cast include people such as Ray Liotta who is calm and well done here, Amy Madigan who although a little over the top at times is still pretty good as Costner's wife Annie. One actor In the movie who deserves great respect is Burt Lancaster, already very ill and unable to act at times to his full potential, he still manages to bring a little charm and even a slight bit of magic to an already talented cast.I loved the dedication and production that went into this, things like the camera work do really well and the score is hauntingly terrific with an Oscar nomination that went James Horner's way. I loved the setting of Iowa, long open spaces and it made the film able to describe it as nothing people would want to see but yet again the true magic of the movie kicks in and you find yourself backing Costner to sort out the troubles he has just for the baseball field.Back to Phil Alden Robinson and he just knows how to direct here, with lovely precision and skill he seems to make a kind of bland sounding plot come alive really well and is truly a credit to all of these kind of emotional roller-coaster films we see. Overall I just felt this was Just about very good and although not quite nearing absolute greatness, is still a cult classic and one film I will remember back to for a long time. This truly is one film you can enjoy with all the ages whether 5 or 85, the sweet plot and the warmth of the characters can even make the most hardened of movie watchers just feel an ounce of happy tears.

74,david-meldrum,"Familiar, Comforting ... And Much More",8,28 November 2020,"This was the film I decided to watch on a day I wanted something familiar and comforting. I'd forgotten much about it, but knew its gentle rhythms and tender heart was likely to do the trick. I spent much of the film thinking it was much more sentimental than I remembered - the script is at times almost painfully on the nose, saying much that had already been silently expressed and needed no more pointing out. The role of baseball in the American psyche is one I'm familiar with; I'm not American, but the significance of the romance of the sport is not hard to see. It crossed my mind that watching this in the dying days of the Trump Presidency (we hope), the film could be read as precisely the sort of America that MAGA longs to return to. But that would be to misread it in the same sort of way Reagan misread 'Born In The USA'. For all the film's obviousness, soft-focus cameras and a score that wants to do your feeling for you it remains a kinder, gentler and still somehow subversive film than the misreading would give it credit for. How many who long to return to some mythical past have the sort of parental wounds this film ultimately speaks to? How many of them (us) need the dreams-into-action that undercut the short-termism of consumer capitalism that this film constantly undermines? And how many of us need to dive into our own pain and mess in order to find some sort of route through to that which we most want but barely even realise?

75,rooee,"Heaven? No, Iowa",8,14 May 2010,"Like all good fables, Field of Dreams' strength lies in its simplicity. All the dilemmas facing the Kinsella family boil down to a straightforward choice: believe or don't. Phil Alden Robinson, whose directorial career has been sorely sparse, creates a divine, self-contained cinematic world, reminding us of why Kevin Costner was such a colossal star, and that Ray Liotta is capable of playing the good guy once in a while. Heck, everyone's the good guy: even the blood-sucking brother-in-law (Timothy Busfield) is trying to rescue Ray (Costner).The hub of the story is the relationship between Ray and Annie (the sprightly Amy Madigan). She never doubts Ray's sanity, so why should we? For all their baked apple pie, Middle American rustic trappings, they're a couple of progressive, camper van-driving ex-hippies, prepared to stand in protest at maniacal right-wing book burnings to defend the legacy of (fictional) civil rights icon Terence Mann (a beaming James Earl Jones).At its considerable heart are the seeds of M Night Shyamalan's elegant eye, as well as the latter film-maker's faintly absurdist notion of human nature, the story playing out like a tapestry of fables woven by an idealist alien who's entranced by possibilities of humankind.Running on a narrative unafraid to take 90-degree turns (well, at least 45), for a mainstream emotion-jerker, this is at times a genuinely strange ghost story. But it's also a love story about America; whimsical, sun-drenched, apologetic, fantastical, but rarely sentimental. A soothing humanist poem, which may be for the most part the cinematic equivalent of easy listening music, but is also, like its hero, driven by unwavering self-belief.",Field of Dreams

One night a man, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta)stands out there and soon the rest of his 'banished' baseball team shows up to play. After hearing the voice again, he seeks out to find help from an old, tired Terence Mann (James Earl Jones). After there meeting, Terrence comes with him and seeks out to find the secret of the voices and the ghosts playing baseball in his backyard. The film is cute, it's funny, and has a genius plot. Kevin Costner is entertaining and the ability to watch dead baseball players is amusing and a bit odd. The voices are explained later but I won't give away what they are. The film is for everyone. James Earl Jones is the presence of just a great actor that but this film over the top. Each baseball player on the field is based on actual players and gave the movie a fun-loving feeling. There's no language if I remember but I may be wrong. Field Of Dreams. Starring: Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones, Amy Madigan, Gaby Hoffman, and Timothy Busfield.4 out of 5 Stars.",Field of Dreams
79,ozthegreatat42330,If you make this picture the audience will come back again and again.,10,15 March 2007,"Perhaps my comment is unnecessary with all of the other rave reviews but this is one of the three best baseball films ever made in my opinion (the other two being ""The Natural"" with Robert Redford and ""The Rookie"" with Dennis Quaid.)What's not to like about this beautiful film. Costner's Ray Kinsella is a superior performance with the sincerity of the the actor, and the emotion which is real in every scene. Amy Madigan is excellent in the role of the wife, especially in the PTA meeting scene where she destroys the book burning bigot. Ray Liota is utterly charming as the legendary Shoeless Joe Jackson. James Earle Jones is magnificent as Terrance Mann and Burt Lancaster winds up a long and triumphant movie career in this, his motion pitier swan song as Dr. Archibald ""Moonlight"" Graham. The most touching performance is Dwyer Brown's three minutes on screen as John Kinsella at the very end of the film. The other, lesser actors also did a workmanlike job in their supporting roles. I have watched this film maybe a half dozen times, and I try to stay away from it for long periods so that it will be fresh all over again when I see it anew. If there ever was a film that captures the mythology of baseball, this one is it. If they will build this picture, the audience will come and come again, they will go the distance and their pain will be eased. This ""Field of Dreams"" is a dream come true for people looking for a truly magnificent film.",Field of Dreams
80,disinterested_spectator,Only for the Fans,4,26 February 2015,"A movie about baseball can be enjoyed by someone who cares nothing about baseball, but I doubt that this movie is one of them. It excessively romanticizes the game, declaring it be the essence of all that is good about America, so much so that it even glorifies the men who threw the 1919 World Series. What kind of statement about America is that?But if that were not challenge enough, the movie also involves some kind of supernatural reality in which we are all supposed to follow our dreams and fulfill our destiny. But since some people make bad choices, Kevin Costner's destiny is to correct some of those bad choices, including his own, and make everything all right again.And even that might not be so bad if it were not for the movie's relentless insipid attitude about the wonder of it all.",Field of Dreams
81,flicklover,Just Magic!!!,10,17 April 2020,"Field of Dreams is on of those films that I can watch over and over again and feel something every time. It is the type of film that Hollywood hardly ever makes anymore. It is very magical without big special effects but it is grounded in very real emotions. It is considered a baseball film, but is much more than that.Kevin Costner stars as Ray Kinsella. A corn farmer that lives in Iowa with his wife Annie played by Amy Madigan and his daughter. He is almost 40 tears old and ruminates about his tough relationship with his father who had passed away. He regrets not having had a better relationship with him. His father was a big baseball fan. His favorite player was Shoeless Joe Jackson, the famous player that was one of the 8 players that were kicked out of baseball for supposedly fixing a World Series in 1919. Ray used to fight with his father, he used to tell him that he couldn't respect a man who's favorite baseball player was a criminal. Ray suddenly hears a voice in his field that says ""if you build it, he will come"". At first, Ray doesn't understand what to build but then has a vision of a baseball field. He feels he has to build it and eventually does. His wife is supportive but thinks he's a little crazy. He builds the field but nothing happens. One night, Ray's daughter tells him that there is a man standing in the baseball field. Ray realizes that it is Shoeless Joe Jackson. They speak and play a little baseball. Soon, other oldtime players appear on the field to play baseball. The scenes with Joe and the other players are really funny and magical. The great thing is that this film is a fantasy but with big special effects. The voice still haunts Ray telling a little more as the film goes along, he goes on a journey based on the voice. There are so many great, moving moments in his journey. I know this film is considered a baseball film but to me it is more than that. It is more to me about Ray's guilt and regret about not being closer to his father. I always have identified with that because I had a similar relationship with my dad. It is a really moving film, alot of people think it's sappy but I don't think so. It us certainly an old fashioned Hollywood film. The kind they don't make anymore. And yes, there's a speech in the film about baseball in the film that is so great I get a lump.in my throat every time I hear it. I truly love this film.Grade: A",Field of Dreams
82,deepfrieddodo,Who Is This For?,3,29 October 2020,"What the hell is this film? I initially thought it might be for kids, but the language suggests otherwise. So I suppose just fantasy? Supernatural drama? The whole thing is just nonsense, I do not understand why people love this film so much. Am I missing something, or is this only a film for Americans and baseball fanatics?The basic story just appears to be made up as it goes along, as if the writers believed they would never have gotten as far as they did. The script I suppose is okay, and there are a few good lines, plus Madigan is very charismatic. The rest of the acting is okay, insofar as maybe before this was edited they believed everything would make sense. Visually, fine. The soundtrack at one point was panpipes, and added absolutely nothing.I was expecting a classic. Instead it began as dull, swiftly moving through a story in the first 20 minutes, towards the end it was downright laughable, before ending on sentimental crap. I can only imagine this can be enjoyed if you were an American, a baseball fan, and alive to see it in cinema on its release.",Field of Dreams
83,rollernerd,Baseball has marked the time,8,18 August 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the baseball drama fantasy flick Field of Dreams (1989) which stars the likeable Kevin Costner as Ray Kinsella who recently bought a farm in Iowa. Ray hears a mysterious voice while he is farming in the corn fields - the voice tells him ""If you build it, he will come."" This is pretty much in the first 5 minutes of the movie and straight away I was like yeppp this is a religious flick - I was right, but the religion is baseball. But more to it, the flick speaks about second chances through baseball. Ray is compelled by the strange message, and even convinces his wife what he heard was real and definite. The voice and a vision drives Ray building a baseball field on his farm and afterwards ghosts of past great baseball players including 'Shoeless Joe Jackson' arrive on the field to train and play. Shoeless Joe Jackson, the famous alleged criminal from the 1919 Black Sox Scandal who was dismissed from the game of baseball forever just suddenly rocks up...now I'm thinking hmmm a ghost film? But nope, again I was wrong.The acting in this film is great, right across the board - its natural, raw and strong where we have characters who question their livelihood - have they accomplished what they have wanted, have their dreams come to fruition? As a movie viewer, I believed in the characters when they say what they say and do what they do. The whole tone and feel of the film let us believe in the choices the characters make and how we sometimes not have second chances in our limitless yet precious lives. I really rooted for Ray to build the field and have Shoeless Joe Jackson appear so he can achieve a spontaneous milestone, I wanted Terrance Mann to go on a road trip with Ray I wanted Archie ""Doc Midnight"" Graham to get to play his dream and of course the finale - someone playing catch to catch with their father.James Earl Jones is perfect and top of his game as an ageing activist writer who finds joy once again in his life through the game of baseball, his end scene is cool as where we see a childlike smile on his face which also led to smiling back. And finally the great man himself, Burt Lancaster as Doc Graham, whose films I have never seen, he showed what a great actor really should be. Every line the man gives is profoundly emotional, his performance is just nailed to perfection.To be honest movie goers, this film hit me, which is rare, and again to be honest it made me wonder how a simple story, which by default is so preposterous can ever work. But somehow, I was deeply moved like the miraculous incidents which the characters of both Costner and Jones experience. There are positive qualities in this film and really dives deep into lost opportunities, missed connections and chances of redemption. Overall 8/10.",Field of Dreams
84,cinephile-27690,This Is My Favorite Kevin Costner Movie!,10,6 July 2018,"I am on a goal to see every movie in the book 1001 Movies You Must See before You Die. This is in there, so I got my hands on a VHS and saw it. It was so good that I put it in my top 10, which impressed my Grandma since I was weaning out of mostly watching Veggie Tales and other cartoons. After seeing numerous more movies, it was ranked in the 30s. I re-watched it last night and returned to my top 10. This movie is so magical and makes you believe anything could happen. As Roger Ebert put it: ""It's a religious picture-but the religion is baseball."" Ebert later called it the 7th best movie of 1989. Unfortunately, Siskel did not see that and gave it thumbs down! This movie leaves you with a great fuzzy feeling few movies can give you. If you watch it, the feeling will come!",Field of Dreams
85,higherall7,A Voice of Faith Leads Beyond All Logic,8,2 April 2016,"What would you do if you heard a voice say to you, ""If you build it, he will come..""?This wonderful baseball fable posits exactly that type of inquiry into the difference between Faith and Logic. It explores at some length what people will do when they have that moment when 'something told me to-' in their lives. This usually happens to everyone, when they either regret or marvel at the consequences of following or not following that inner voice that comes to them out of nowhere. Ray Kinsella has a series of these experiences and finds that listening to his own special voice leads him to a Field of Dreams.Enjoyed this movie for its simplicity. Also, for the fact that it does not depend on hyper-violence or explosions or expressions of scatology to carry the narrative or appeal grossly to the sensations of the viewing audience. The concept is really an interesting and entertaining one. I have already mentioned the interface between Faith and Logic, but there is also an interesting melding between what some would call the fantasies of the Imagination and Reality.Kevin Costner is near perfect as the every man Ray Kinsella. James Earl Jones as the reclusive writer Terrance Mann has most of the best lines, and Ray Liotta is perfectly believable as the phantom Shoeless Joe Jackson; who brings the rest of his cohorts to a cornfield in Iowa. Burt Lancaster brings a rugged albeit crusty earthiness to this tale of Baseball in the Corn as Doctor Archibald 'Moonlight' Graham, who confidently strides between the living and the dead with much the same swagger as he showed in JIM THORPE: ALL American. Sometimes you can fault him for using his hands too much, but this is moot point. Amy Madigan and Gaby Hoffman are also charming and admirable as the feisty wife and winsome daughter who steadfastly stand by Ray in his quest to understand the meaning of his dream.This is one of those movies that I felt was perfect for spawning sequels. I would have loved to have seen Terrance Man come back with players from the Negro Leagues to really give the Black Sox Eight a run for their money. Eventually, it would have been great for Ray to encounter a Latino version of Terrance Mann, and to find players like Roberto Clemente and others holding their hands over their hearts for the playing of the National Anthem in his corn field.One can only hope that day will come in this Field of Dreams.",Field of Dreams
86,MovieGuy109,Bit off more than it could chew,5,22 November 2011,"Field of Dreams is a film about baseball that has nothing to say about the sport and a film about the supernatural that has nothing new to add to that genre either. Ultimately, there is nothing here other than a lot of sentimentality and a talented cast. Unfortunately, those two things do not always make a great movie especially with little help from any other category. The attraction factor to this film is obvious; a heartwarming story about baseball with Kevin Costner. Unfortunately, that is about it in this one-note creation that really is nothing but a bunch of clichés on top of an ending that makes you laugh instead of cry. It's unintentional laughter I tell you.",Field of Dreams
87,antagonist117,What did baseball do to deserve this odiously cheesy ode?,3,14 February 2015,"It's not often that a PG-rated movie makes me squirm. ""Field of Dreams"" is so painfully cheesy that I have to spend a lot of it looking away in second-hand embarrassment. It's the kind of movie where everything every character says is an overwritten paragraph meant to begin in a hushed whisper and end in a proud, booming crescendo as an orchestra swells and fireworks go off in the distance and tears well in everyone's eyes. Occasionally they well in mine because I'm laughing at Kevin Costner's typically-leaden delivery of absurdly on-the-nose lines, as when he gazes at the ghost of his father as a young man and says, ""I only saw him years later when he was worn down by life.""Burt Lancaster, film great though he is, is an even bigger cheese merchant than Costner. He's perhaps only doing what the script demands that he do when he puts that twinkle in his eye and turns slowly toward the camera with a thousand-yard stare and a grandfatherly smile and tells the story of how he almost made it in the big leagues that one sepia-tinged day back when America was younger and more innocent (Jackie Robinson gets an offhand mention, but the racism of early baseball is, of course, whitewashed). Lancaster does all this just as writer/director Phil Robinson seems to wish, but this is too much earnest Americana even for Frank Capra. Robinson should have summed Capra's ghost instead of the 1919 Chicago White Sox. He would have told Lancaster to turn it down.If anyone in the movie is able to wear this tripe well, it's James Earl Jones, whose sonorous delivery is suited to the swollen, didactic material. Amy Madigan comes out unscathed, too, because she's playing her character as if she's only tangentially in the film. She's married to Costner's character, having met him during their idolized 1960s youth, but she is as high-energy as he is low, and fights even more passionately for the Bill of Rights (yes, really) than he does for his stadium in the cornfield.It's tempting to say that this movie could only be made about baseball, the pastoral sport with its long history and lists of heroes. There's a reason Ken Burns, chronicler of American exceptionalism, made a documentary about it and not football or golf. But in truth, I think the same sort of weepy panegyric could be written for any sport. There have been rhapsodic film treatises about boxing, after all. Just nothing so corny, so metaphysically half-baked, as this.",Field of Dreams
88,adventure-21903,Brilliant!,10,25 May 2019,"Kevin Costner scores a grand slam in this great movie about baseball but more importantly about human feelings. I see this movie many times and never failed to cry at the very end of the movie. Splendidly acted and directed.The movie very well could be Heaven but as Costner says so memorably ""It's Iowa"".There isn't a man alive doesn't cry att the end of the movie if he had a chance to play catch with his father one more time.",Field of Dreams
89,daoldiges,This Dream Delivers,8,31 March 2019,"Field of Dreams never held any interest for me - Kevin Costner, baseball, corn fields, the high potential for cliche, predictability, and pandering, just seemed too likely for me to go near it. However, 29 years later I decided that I would check it out. It began pretty much as I expected, but I stayed with it and am really happy that I did. Even though the story is highly melancholy and sentimental, the straightforward direction keeps it grounded and it ultimately works.

90,budikavlan,Overrated,5,12 July 2002,"This is a beautifully acted and directed production in service of one of the silliest, most meaningless plots ever conceived.  It has cult appeal to a group who get off on stories about fathers and sons realizing they love each other, but the story hardly merits such devotion.  The setting is one of real drama:  a failing family farm.  Into this is thrown a few silly bits of magic realism, followed by random leaps of logic by the main character, all of which is rendered largely meaningless by the last scene; the moves he has made haven't really led to the ""big moment"" at all.  It seems like it was written by a confused teenager who really likes baseball but feels neglected by his father.  He should've just sucked it up and gotten on with his life.",Field of Dreams
91,heisenberg12,Truly One of the Greatest American Movies Ever Made,10,23 October 2019,"Such a bold claim would probably make people think I'm as crazy as Ray Kinsella in the movie, but it's no kidding. At a 7.5 rating on IMDB, it's astounding this movie is so underrated, but I can definitely see how some people can criticize it since it relies heavily on fantasy and perceived to be implausible events.But what people fail to see is that this movie is an allegory, and it's actually about a guy who follows his dreaming of starting his own business, which is to open a minor league baseball field where none exist, in Iowa. But the movie uses creativity and allegorical references to reveal the deeper, heartfelt reasons as to why Ray Kinsella follows his heart rather than his head to take such a big risk as a business venture, turning his farm into a ballpark.Even still, it is deeper than that. IN order to succeed, Ray needs publicity, so he calls on the writing of Pulitzer Prize winner Terrence Mann to sell it. He reveals to Mann on the car ride home to Iowa something which makes Mann realize that Ray is doing all of this for his penance, to redeem himself of his sins, and inadvertently by doing so, Ray is also giving hope to a select few others, as well as future customers who love baseball.Shoeless Joe Jackson and the rest of the players are not only tied to Ray's original sin, which has haunted him all these years, but they also reveal Ray's love for the game of baseball in his own words, and why he is taking such a big risk with his venture.""What is heaven?"", Ray asks his father, who replies, ""It's where dreams come true"", to which Ray further replies, ""Then this must be heaven"".Wow, if this movie doesn't make you cry then there has to be something wrong, since very few movies pull at someone's heartstrings this well, and constantly throughout. What an outstanding movie that deserves an 8.0 rating on here. It's really a 9/10, but I'm giving it a 10/10 because of the low 7.5 score.",Field of Dreams
92,kyle-cruse,Wonderful,10,12 August 2008,"""Field of Dreams"" goes to show that movies do not have to be logical, realistic, or believable to be excellent. I'm amazed by this film. In this film, Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) hears a voice telling him ""If you build it, he will come."" He believes this means he must build a baseball field for dead player ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson to come play in. From there he ends up following more instructions from the voice, all of which end up helping him see his dead father again and make up for the lost time they never had. Forgive me for spoiling the plot, but I can't help it when telling what I love about this film. Perhaps its the acting of this film that makes it so great, as Costner as well as the supporting cast (including Burt Lancaster and James Earl Jones) are all excellent. However, I think it's the film's inspiring story that makes us love it so much. The film has little to do with baseball; it has everything to do with the relationship between a grown man and his father. Films like this don't come around often. See it for sure. What an absolute perfect movie.**** out of ****",Field of Dreams
93,WubsTheFadger,Field of Dreams,8,3 January 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe acting throughout the film is great. Kevin Costner does a great job at portraying a man in need of answers. James Earl Jones also does a fantastic job. His character is likable and his end scene put a childlike smile on my face. Ray Liotta gives a great performance as well. Amy Madigan, who plays Costner's wife, does a good job but can be annoying at times. Even though this movie is old, it still holds up in regards to the acting. The Iowa landscape is beautiful. The corn fields and baseball fields are amazing to look at.The story is heartfelt, enjoyable, and well paced. Towards the end, I felt a sort of childlike happiness and joy that only a few films have given me. The ending is very emotional and touching. The film does leave some unanswered questions though. Most notably: Where did the ""voice"" come from? And what is beyond the corn field?Pros: Great performances by Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones, and Ray Liotta, amazing scenery, heartfelt and touching story, and a very emotional endingCons: Amy Madigan's character is sometimes annoying and some unanswered plot questionsOverall Rating: 8.5P.S.

95,dkncd,Not an average baseball film,10,6 September 2007,"Absent from ""Field of Dreams"" are the clichés seen in other baseball films. There's no player or team that faces difficulties only to overcome adversity in order to win in the final game of the season. Instead, the film follows Ray Kinsella as he is told by a mysterious voice to a number of tasks beginning with building a baseball field on his farm. It sounds very contrived, but the eccentric storyline's turns managed to remain interesting, engaging and inspiring for the film's duration. That's from someone that isn't even a fan of baseball.Kevin Costner handles the lead well as Ray Kinsella and James Earl Jones is excellent as the reclusive writer Terence Mann. All of the supporting performances were also notable, including the various baseball players and Amy Madigan as Ray's supportive and crusading wife.

97,dataconflossmoor,Indulge Me!!!,10,5 November 2007,"It is simply amazing to realize what length a person will go to in order to pursue a conviction!! Kevin Costner's character in ""Field of Dreams"" is one whereby he feels that a devotion to a belief is far more important than the day to day rigors of living...Baseball was indeed a passion for him, as were the 1960's a passion for him!! These culminating interests resonated an end result whereby Kevin Costner's fascination with a prominent writer, Terence Mann became imminently pertinent. Terance Mann was a writer who necessitated viewpoints concerning the emerging radicalism during the tumultuous era of the 1960's!! Mann purveyed many ideologically poignant philosophies which had left an indelible impact on many individuals!! The characters that Kevin Costner and Amy Madigan played in this movie, were two such people!!What was the significance to baseball in this movie? Essentially, it was the pursuit of how an American icon which upholds the rigid beliefs that following your dreams can materialize into a higher social consciousness. Such a fervor would be the prevailing concept which astutely sums it up!! Baseball had made a tremendous resurgence in the 1980's, and a philosophical fixation, as demonstrated in ""Field of Dreams"", which was made in 1987, accommodated such a pique!! If it is a lifelong goal to be the best baseball player in the major league that you can possibly be, than, this is not just another job for a baseball player, it is, in fact, an adamant attempt to be a legend!! What person in their right mind would put a baseball field in the middle of valuable farmland? Who would drive 1,200 miles away to Boston for no real reason whatsoever? Someone who recognizes the importance of building a dream!!So!! What is to indulge in this movie? Basically Everything!!!What this means is that none of this movie is realistic, all of it is hypothetical, something that we have chosen to leave to the imagination!! This is what makes this film so marvelous!! The movie ""Field of Dreams"" is a proliferation of the idea that your persistent curiosity has the yearning desire to unearth a spiritual and emotional fervor which is truly genuine!! Why is this so important? Because we know that spiritually, and emotionally, there is so much more to get out of life than we wind up attaining!! It is very enlightening when someone is motivated by an ideological passion!! This baseball field cultivated a panacea for dedicated believers in a lofty concept about understanding the human nature of anyone who played and loved baseball!! This movie, as well as ""The Natural"", were two baseball movies which emanate a seemingly worthwhile tenet of cogency concerning an acquisition of a feasible idealism!! I truly feel that this movie is a must for all movie viewers.. The historical perspective in this movie is truly incredible!! The acting in ""Field of Dreams"" is sensational, Kevin Costner, Amy Madigan, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones, and even a cameo appearance by Burt Lancaster made this film a bonanza for acting brilliance!! Robinson's directing efforts for this movie are absolutely spectacular!! The revelation that baseball has homogenized the kindred spirits of someone's ideological premise for their intellectually tenacious ambitions, only means one thing, this is America!!! In my books, this film gets a resounding THUMBS UP!!",Field of Dreams

Let's have a real baseball movie with a good story, like The Natural for fiction, or for nonfiction sentimentality, just watch The Pride of the Yankees or The Jackie Robinson Story.

Its premise is silly beyond belief, and as a true Canadian, I should despise its ""American Dream"" undertones. But for some reason it works - perfectly. I have seen this movie time and again and each time I love it more.Why? Why should a movie about a broke farmer who plows under his field to build a ball park so dead guys can play baseball while he hunts down a reclusive author, work? I think this movie hits a chord with me of relieving your life of frustration.Here is a man on the brink on destruction and to get himself out, he follows his instinct, no matter how stupid. He believes in the voice and the message he is getting so much, that he risks what little he has, and convinces his wife to go along for the ride. Who of us does not admire Ray Kinsella for his passionate, brazen stupidity, and wished at some point that we could do the same.Maybe that's it.It is a very well made film, to be certain. Acting, writing and cinematography are all Oscar worthy. The small role by Burt Lancaster is so beautiful, when he sums up his life by saying ""Had I only been a doctor for five minutes, that would have been a tragedy."" James Earl Jones is brilliant in the role of a reclusive 60s rebel author who wants nothing more than privacy. Field of Dreams is silly and far-fetched, but like Forrest Gump, it works.

This is not strictly a baseball movie, however, I find it to be the best baseball film of all-time.  Phil Alden Robinson has captured the spirituality of a plain baseball field and the thousands of dreams that are based on it.  As soon as ""Ray Kinsella"" (Costner in a good performance) hears the voices of the netherworld, we are immediately intrigued and brought into the heavenly cornfield he stands in. Baseball is the symbol of stability that has always been around when human beings cease to exist on this earth.  The joy of the ghostly players is felt by us as well and Costner's family is obviously at the centerpoint of something incredible.This small, but poignant film is one of those rare gems that transcends conventionality and truly reaches for your heart.  Composer James Horner (TITANIC) helps immensely with a score that moves you on its own.  Amy Madigan is Costner's trusting wife and fellow free-spirit of the 60's.  The other performances are all fine as well.  James Earl Jones plays the reclusive writer Terence Mann, based on real life author of the 60's generation J.D. Salinger (Catcher in the Rye).  Lancaster is a heavenly presence as the good doctor seen by Costner in another dimension of place and time.  Burt plays old ""Doc Graham"", an ex-ballplayer who never got to bat in the major leagues.  His part in the story is an important building block to the film's point.  A second chance at an unaccomplished pursuit of a dream and a chance for redemption.Ray Liotta is colorful and wise as legendary Shoeless Joe Jackson. (By the way, who cares that he really batted left and threw right).  Baseball purists may find this meaningless error deterrent to the picture as a whole, which is ridiculous.  Liotta's comments on the ghostly player's opinion of the difficult Ty Cobb is hilarious.  A commune of teamwork and love of the game exists between the ghosts and the Kinsellas are allowed to watch some great games between players long dead.  I know anyone reading this far who could give a hoot about baseball may be turned off, but you must see this motion picture to believe it.  It is a triumph of the human spirit, a triumph of forgiveness, and a realization of life after death.The whole sub-plot element of the 60's and James Earl Jones' reasons for ""being there"" are ambiguous at times, but can easily be overlooked.  FIELD OF DREAMS is like ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE or E.T.  We see something that takes place in the real world, but otherworldly events transpire to make us think and feel.  It is a tear-jerker like the latter films because it appeals so much to our emotions.  The purity of baseball and personal relationships are juxtaposed perfectly to create a stunning work of art.  Get this for your father on Father's Day.RATING: 10+ OF 10",Field of Dreams
103,Sulla-2,For our parents,10,3 June 2018,"That's what it says in the credits if you stay long enough to notice. It's a statement that sums up the whole film. I don't intend to write a resume of the film as it has been done by many others. It's a very great film and I feel obliged to mention some of my favourite bits. The moment when Terrence Mann gives a nervous grin just before he disappears into the corn. The moment when Ray mets a young and fit father, a father he never knew. That was something which really hit home to me. I never knew my dad in his best years. Any scenes with Doc Graham but especially the last. Burt was always one of my very favourite actors and in this he was excellent. Perfect for the part.Lastly, the moment when they did come",Field of Dreams
104,Caps Fan,Outta Here!!,8,6 May 2003,"Well, what can I say? Actually, quite a lot. This is a truly lovely film which comes over well on DVD. I enjoyed its craziness, didn't mind its silliness, and reveled in its humor and drama. Fine acting by all concerned doesn't hurt and when it is coupled with excellent camera work, a generally literate script, and music that rarely intrudes, the result is a winner. It does stray into excessive sentimentality at times, but then, so does baseball! Recommended. Rating: 8/10.",Field of Dreams
105,mwcrunner,A pretty good baseball movie here,8,30 May 2016,"In this movie we see a pretty good story based on the novel of it and James Earl Jones gives out one of his best performances as he did as the voice of Darth Vader and Mufasa in the Lion King. This story tells about Ray Kinsella who owns a farm and hears a mysterious voice telling him to build a baseball field so that he will come. That puts him and his family in a financial crisis though as building the baseball field cost them a lot of money and if they didn't have the money to pay off for the field they would have to sell the farm. Everything worked out in the end though as for more people started to believe that the 1919 Chicago White Sox were playing again in the field that Ray built. This is sort of a ghost story here but not the scary type. Also James Earl Jones's character was a ghost too and pretended that he was actually a famous writer. Also the person that Ray built the field for was none other then his own father and they saw each other again when he came. Now I don't believe in ghosts, but this is still a good film.",Field of Dreams
106,thewillt08,"Dreams Can Come True, You Just Gotta Work For It.",8,4 August 2013,"Put Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones, and baseball in a movie and you know I will watch it. There are not many things I love more in this world than baseball and movies. Field of Dreams is hands down the best baseball movie ever made. With the great acting from Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones is backed up by the great writing and interesting and mystical story. I first saw this movie when I was very young and The Voice scared me but I manned up and watched it, and I loved it. In case you don't know the story, Ray, a farmer from Iowa, hears a voice that changes his life. This embarks him on an adventure where dreams can come true and the sport of baseball ties in perfectly.Kevin Costner narrates the first scene and he gives am awesome backstory to Shoeless Joe Jackson, himself, his father, and his family. I love that scene for introducing everything we need to know about the movie. I never heard of Joe Jackson or the 1919 Black Sox Scandal so that was cool. The movie starts with the voice saying ""If you build it, he will come,"" lines that everybody who has seen or even not seen the movie knows. These lines made this more than a baseball movie introducing mysticism and a higher power into the real world. The voice scared me and in a way it still does, its creepy and I put myself in Ray's position and I don't know what I would have done. My favorite scene is the first scene with Ray and Joe Jackson. Ray follows his gut and the voice by deciding to plow over a chunk of his corn to build a baseball field. He built it, and Shoeless Joe came. The scene itself is subtle as Jackson stands in left field, his actual position when he played, Ray then picks up a bat and hits balls to him. After a few hits Jackson comes in they talk a little and then Jackson takes the bat and he hits. There is no music in this scene, it is the natural sounds of the night and the crack of the bat. It was beautifully shot and the sound captured the imagination of the situation. Ray was pitching to a ghost. Then the writing came in. The way Jackson described the game of baseball was perfect. He says something along the lines of, ""to me it wasn't a game, it was life."" Being a huge fan of baseball I know exactly what he means and he was so right. The voice comes back and brings Costner to Boston to find James Earl Jones. The field took a huge chunk out of their money and Ray was going broke. This added the major conflict in the story. It is a race against time and money so Ray takes a bigger risk and goes to Boston to find Terrance Mann. Terrance Mann is an author from the 60s and this movie ties so many generations together so well. The old days with Jackson, the 60s with Mann and the present day of the film. Mann also has a strong connection with baseball so he ties in perfectly. James Earl Jones brings his loud and strong voice to this character. This is my favorite role he has played as his character has so much depth.Nothing made me happier than seeing old Fenway without the green monster seats. Fenway Park is the best stadium in major league baseball and was the perfect choice for this movie, and that's coming from a Yankee fan. They could have went for Yankee Stadium and possible touched on the history of the stadium and the sport, but no, they chose Fenway and I couldn't have been happier. The mind boggling in this movie is crazy with the twists and turns are hard to believe. There are elements of time travel and what is in the corn field which I am still trying to figure out. Another famous quote, ""Hey, is this Heaven?"" ""No, it's Iowa."" The fact that they deny that its heaven is interesting because to the men the field affected it seemed like heaven. I would have called it heaven. Ray's brother-in-law can't see the player so that is an interesting factor that obviously is used to keep the problem relevant but other than that this movie is flawless.Overall, Field of Dreams is one of the best movies ever made. It molded careers in Costner and made James Earl Jones' even greater. The ""People Will Come, Ray"" speech was one I could listen to over and over and is another piece of beautiful writing. The description of baseball and the effects it has on people is 100% true. The score to this movie is also fantastic and fits each scene perfectly. Field of Dreams is a baseball story but also so much more so for that it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",Field of Dreams

The scene between Kevin Costner and his father reduced me to a blubbering wreck. I've seen the movie a few times and it still draws out all the emotions inside me. I'm sure there's a lot of guys out there that can relate to the relationship between Ray Kinsella (Kevin C) and his father. Sure you can pick holes in the schmaltzy storyline if you want to - that's your prerogative. But there are a lot of good points to it. If you are sentimental, you will love it! (As I did).

112,fleagles,"Passionate baseball film, but much more",10,13 April 2000,"Baseball is and always will be the greatest American game, and no film has brought the passion of baseball to light like Field of Dreams.  However, this film is more than that: it is a story of ghosts, of fathers and sons, and reconnecting hopes and dreams together.Kevin Costner, is a terrific and wholly believable performance, plays Ray Kinsella, a former hippie and current Iowa farmer, living with his wife, Annie (Amy Madigan) and daughter Karen (Gaby Hoffmann).  As he walks through his cornfields one day, he hears a voice that says to him: `If you build it, he will come.'  Costner interprets this message to mean that he should build a baseball field in the middle of his farm, even though it would mean a terrible financial loss.  From there, the story takes twists and turns involving the writer Terrence Mann (James Earl Jones), the great, but shamed baseball star Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta), and others.Most of all, though, this film is about second chances. Without giving away too much, it should be said that Phil Alden Robinson, who both brilliantly wrote and directed this film, manages to takes the very best emotions from the game and merge them with the importance of family, redemption, and even magic.  This is truly a classic film that should stand as among the greatest films of our time.Vote: 10",Field of Dreams

114,jillbeckinheim7,Good sports film!,6,2 November 2021,"Special props to Ray Liotta as Shoeless Joe Jackson and Burt Lancaster as Moonlight Graham. Both were amazing. Still, their characters were very loosely based on true story. Moonlight Graham was in fact a ballplayer who appeared in only one MLB game. Following that one game, he continued playing professionally through the 1908 season, mostly in the New York State League, until retiring at the age of 30 before becoming a doctor in Chisholm, Minnesota. The film takes some liberties with his story. Graham really died in 1965, but producer Francis Ford Coppola wanted to see his film ""The Godfather"" on a marquee, so Ray goes back to 1972 to find him. The degree of Shoeless Joe Jackson's culpability in the Black Sox Scandal is also changed or little mention to put his character in a better light. Glad, they change the movie from ""Shoeless Joe"" to Field of Dreams, because the movie has little to do with Shoeless Joe Jackson. It would make the movie seem more like a bio-pic. The movie isn't all about baseball. It does have a weird odd sub-plot about book banning that raises some legitimate debate about censorship. While, it's great that they indeed tackle this issue in film and give more depth to Amy Madigan's character, Annie Kinsella; but it's just seem out of the blue, and comes out of nowhere. Did the screen writer, Phil Alden Robinson, have a political agenda he wanted to address? Who knows! This scene could had been avoided. It's really does slow the movie down. It's like talking about football, and somehow brings up the issue of banning art like David Cerny.",Field of Dreams
115,cartesianthought,This is the American Dream captured inside of a movie.,9,20 December 2015,"It's a baseball movie but you don't need to know anything about the game to enjoy the movie. Baseball was decided as the theme of the movie because it is an old American past-time, a pursuit of hard work and a bond between father and son. In some ways, it's comparable to Forrest Gump, but it takes a much more favorable tone of counter-culture.Sometimes it's hokey, but it is a fantasy movie. Every scene is intricately done. Characters are led by their dreams and everyone ends up where they need to be. It's a hymn of idealism that shows people at their very best achieving their dreams.

I'm sure by now we're all familiar with the premise - an Iowa farmer hears a disembodied voice that says, ""If you build it he will come"", which in turn leads him to plow under his cornfield to build a full baseball diamond.Many people have talked about the themes explored by this movie (and there are many - family, redemption, pursuit of dreams, etc.), or the very believable characters. All of that is great.But what I especially appreciated about this film was the ending. Everything builds up to it, and like so many things in the film, it ends on a perfect, serene note.

As a film, its mystical, magical quality, delightful characters, intriguing story, and sense of wonder is a joy to get all caught up in.  Equally balanced with playful, touching, quizzical moments--keeping the viewer constantly trying to figure out what is going on and what it all means--it is truly a unique film.  The Burt Lancaster character and storyline is an absolutely ingenious addition to the film.  It creates the first emotionally beautiful and touching moment in the film--but even that does not prepare the viewer for the final storyline twist that is so perfect,  so beautifully heartbreaking, and simultaneously uplifting at the same time. It is a wish fulfillment that I think so many of us achingly long for--and it only happens in our dreams.   But it is nice to know that in our dreams, we can be comforted.",Field of Dreams

119,brianlion,"Wonderful Premise, Lousy Research- As Too Many People Dropped The Ball",8,12 November 2002,"I've seen ""Field of Dreams"" many times now and it is one of my favorite sport movies ever, despite the many errors and inconsistencies. There are some scenes which have a mystical quality to it. In particular, when Ray (Kevin Costner) sees his father again and has a game of catch with him. It is very sentimental and touching. The background music is wonderful. But this movie does not get a higher vote from me because the producers did not do their homework on some key issues. Maybe it is trivial, but if they were going to do it, they should have done it right. For example, Ray Liota plays Shoeless Joe Jackson. Shoeless Joe was a country boy from North Carolina who could not read or write. He was a great hitter. In fact, Babe Ruth copied Jackson's swing, which was-- a left-handed swing. In the movie, Shoeless Joe bats right handed, and talks with more of a Brooklyn accent than the southern drawl he surely had. They also give Jackson way too much sophistication. OK, it's just a movie, but do it with some historical correctness. Did anyone else think Ray's wife was not a good visual match for him? Just bad casting, including the brother in law Mark. Also, every uniform was white and basically looked the same. Did anyone do checks for errors and goofs in this film? There were a lot of them. It distracts from the film. I thought James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster were terrific, and Costner played the role wide-eyed and humble enough to pull it off. This movie reminds us how special baseball used to be, and what a historical and ancient game it is. It grew as this country grew. It endured through two world wars, a depression, turmoil and conflicts around the globe. It was the sport I grew up watching, and listening on a small transistor radio. The director and crew got the feeling of baseball right. But the historical facts, and the many errors and goofs tell me too many people dropped the ball on this film.",Field of Dreams

I am not a bit interested in baseball, and that might be a problem when watching this movie. I love some sport like football (the European kind), but I do not get baseball, it is maybe very un-European.If you have the passion for baseball it might be a good movie, but if you are an European like me, then you may have a problem with this movie.There are also other things that I do not find interesting. The plot is not very interesting, a man builds a baseball field because God says so. It is a very odd plot.My 10 were not spent good, but at least I did not pay full price.

I think this is my all-time favourite movie. It hits a spot that no other movie ever hit. Obviously, that's a personal reaction, but I can relate to Ray Kinsella's feeling about his father. My father died when I was 21. I'd been away from home at boarding school, then uni, from the age of 11. Of course, I'm grateful for the education, but it meant I got to spend very little time with my father for the last 10 years of his life and I wasn't mature enough to realise the value of the little time I did spend with him. There were things left unsaid when he died. It would be magical to see my fatter again, as Ray gets to do at the end of the movie. Unfortunately, life doesn't afford us such chances in reality. The movie catches those emotions perfectly and I cannot help but she'd a tear at the end, when Ray see his father, so young with his whole life still ahead of him.The acting is superb, from the stars to the bit-parts. The script is wonderful and the music stirs the emotions, too. It's the best thing Costner has done, even now, 28 years later, he still hasn't topped it. The movie made Ray Liotta a star. He was perfectly cast as Shoeless Joe. Jane Earl Jones, as Terence Mann, the disillusioned 60s firebrand, brings that amazing voice to the role and runs through the gamut of emotions,from indignity to wonderment. Amy Madigan is also excellent as the slightly scatty wife of Ray. But I save special praise for Burt Lancaster, in his last movie role, who brings Doc Graham to life so perfectly.

And I don't even follow baseball! But these are two of my favourite films. I think in both the theme is one of redemption, whatever you consider redemption to be. For some reason, the very act of baseball just lends itself to legendary endeavour in a way no other sport ever has.

128,raiderhayseed,Field of Hope and Faith,9,14 November 2013,"Peter Castaldi,who was, for a while, the amiable ABC Youth Radio Triple J film reviewer made a very perceptive comment about American film making. ""The Yanks make the worst films in the world, but when they get it right, they make the best films in the world"". I tend to agree with that notion. He also said that Phil Alden Robinson's ""Field of Dreams"" was a load of rubbish. I don't agree with that notion.OK. So farmers who turn their best corn growing land into baseball diamonds for dead guys will pretty well always go broke. Hoping for good outcomes from crazy notions does not make a man righteous. In fact it is down right irresponsible.But that raises an interesting point about religious beliefs. There is a difference between ""faith"" and ""hope"". The writer of the New Testament letter to the Corinthian church made that clear at the end of chapter 13 of his first letter to that church. Love. Faith. Hope. They are eternal. Everyone can define what hope is. The first two are not as easy to define as most people would like to believe. Read the parable about the Good Samaritan to muddy up your ideas about the definition of Love. Likewise Faith has a very specific meaning. it is more than Hope. It is the ""confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see"". (the letter to Hebrew believers - chapter 11). Moses - the most revered of the Hebrew believers made it clear that if a prophet prophecies something that does not happen, then he is a fraud. The writer of Hebrews chapter 11, the roll call of people who exercised ""faith"" goes on to say, ""All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth."" So Moses' requirement that faith must be backed up by tangible results needs a bit of refining. What seems to be the important component of faith is some revelation received by a person. So the people mentioned in Hebrews 11 all had divine revelations.Ray Kinsella (played with great dignity and authority by Kevin Costner) hears voices emanating from the corn field and stakes his very existence on their veracity, even though he has no idea what they are on about. He has to continue his crazy quest, seeking to gain the acceptance of disapproving people of his crazy utterances""People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own.  If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return.  Instead, they were longing for a better country—a heavenly one.""Peter Castaldi's disapproval notwithstanding, this idea stands up to scrutiny given the sanctimonious hypocrisy of respectable folks back the sixties,(and seventies) and the evil they perpetrated in the name of conventional morality. Anyone standing up for true righteousness was going to be a ""foreigner and stranger on earth""Kinsella: When it came time to go to college, I picked the farthest one away from home I could find. That drove my father right up the wall, but I guess that was the point. At Berkeley, officially my major was English, but really it was the sixties. I marched (in protests), smoked some grass and tried to like sitar musicthen I met Annie, who became my wife But until I heard the voice, I never did a crazy thing in my whole life.The sixties: that period during which the intellectual, emotional and moral bankruptcy of the respectable citizenry was laid bare for all to see, in all its horrible godlessness.I remember an amusing reference in Rolling Stone to the downfall of the Nixon administration. ""All his advisers were respectable, short haired, god-fearing people who didn't take illegal drugs,. Maybe its time some long haired,atheist, drug taking hippies were brought in to government"".Kinsella is scared to death of turning into his father, who may have heard voices but sure didn't listen to themOK A whole self help industry has been built on the feelings of alienation baby boomer sons had from their fathers. Maybe it is the affluence experienced by the baby boomers that gave them the security to contemplate revelation - faith - alienation from their fellows.But then a lot of baby boomers voted for Nixon to be president not once, but twice. A lot of baby boomers supported the Vietnam War. And a lot of baby boomers sit around, drinking in taverns, speaking ill of pot smokers.Kinsella was lucky enough to have a wife who was prepared to stand by her man. Alden Robinson might well have restrained Amy Madigan's kinetic performance, but she does make the point that the alternative was probably becoming one with the local wanna be book burners.It is also refreshing to see Ray Liotta cast in a role of someone other than a villain, assuming you do not judge Shoeless Joe Jackson too harshly. Watch John Sayles' ""Eight Men Out"" to refresh your memory on that matter.Perhaps if America had more people of faith, as it is described in the bible, then the corruption of people such as Shoeless Joe Jackson and the White Sox might be expunged from so many American institutions. But then they have always been a scarce commodity. As Ray Kinsella is told, faith is the province of the chosen few, to whom 'what is out there"" is revealed. Everyone else can exercise hope. For those who meekly exercise hope, hungering and thirsting after righteousness, showing mercy and dreaming of purity of heart, its not such a bad deal. It's one of the three eternal values.",Field of Dreams
129,Dante Hicks,A truly beautiful film,10,2 December 1999,"Yep, if the term 'beautiful' could be used to describe any film it would be this one. Costner and Jones especially give great performances in what is essentially an ensemble piece but Amy Madigan also performs with strength and grace, quite uncommon for female 'wives/girlfriends' of the time. It's just a great little story about a guy who does the crazy thing of plowing up his crops to build a baseball field because voices in his head have told him so. As the film goes along more and more people are drawn to it and start to believe that the best stars of the past have somehow come back from heaven to once again knock a few balls around. I know that when a film gives me a tingly feeling each time another character falls under the 'illusions' spell that I'm on to a great thing. And I am. I love this film, and I'm not American and I don't like Baseball. They could remake this with any sport from any era and it would still be wonderful. I know I'll get a lot of stick from this but I agree, if you don't cry at this film then you aren't really a man. You feel Costner's pain when he discusses his father and their reunion at the end is the finest piece of male bonding ever committed to celluloid. I won't spoil the very end but it has to be seen to be believed, astonishing is the only way to describe it. This is easily the best movie about sports ever, though it's more than that. A perfect ten.",Field of Dreams

134,dan_pap,wanna have a catch,8,13 August 2019,"""l could've sworn it was heaven.""This one hit me right in the feels. I'd seen Field of Dreams a long time ago, but I was too young to pick up on all the references and the plain beauty of this movie. Because believe me, this is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.You don't have to like baseball to enjoy Field of Dreams, but it sure helps. Unlike any other sport, baseball is surrounded by a special kind of nostalgia. ""lt reminds us of all that once was good, and it could be again."" Field of Dreams perfectly uses that nostalgia to create a story about a man who builds a baseball field to give people a second chance at their dreams. Shoeless Joe, a folk hero of baseball, was forbidden to play the sport until Kevin Costner built a field just for him. Obviously there's a little bit of magic involved, but what is baseball without some magic?I figured this would be a cheesy '80's movie. Though it has some of the cheese factor, it's made too innocently not to enjoy. I can relate to every character in the story, and the ending is especially touching. Field of Dreams is a prime example of how a mere film can develop such a personal relationship with its audience. This is one of those tall tales that could have easily been a disaster, but instead turned out to be one of my all-time favorite baseball movies. Recommended for anyone reading this.",Field of Dreams
135,martinmatt-81974,Incredible story and magical experience,10,26 May 2019,This film is amazing. It has great storytelling and Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones provide incredible acting. The movie makes you feel good and it makes you cry. I really recommend this movie!,Field of Dreams
136,Syxiepoo,Guyflick?,10,8 December 2015,"Just watched this again for the umpteenth time and, yet again, I'm a wreck by the end. I've thought it through and tried to analyse my reaction, but all that seems to happen is confusion. Now sure, I'm getting old, and maybe that's what this is all about ... for me.I always had a vivid imagination and could scare myself witless whilst reading certain books. The first book that really scared me was ""The Devil Rides Out"" and, oddly, so did the movie. Overall though, I found I could usually hold it together. I was never prone to getting teary-eyed over romantic and moving stories. That said, I did shed a little tear when I first saw ""Miracle on 34th Street"" with Dickie Attenborough. Maybe that was the start of it all. Now I shed a tear because Dickie has gone.I'm a Brit, and have no history with American Baseball, other than a few questionable games with friends way back when. It's rarely featured on TV over here, but I did see a couple of great games when on vacation in Florida, and I do get it. What I do know though is that whilst Baseball is the vehicle, it's the humanity of this story that has the impact. It's about opportunities missed, things unsaid, continuity of life ... even after death (no ... not zombies!).There have been several adverse reviews of the movie, but usually by people who're over-analysing. If you don't get this movie without reading the reviews of others and picking at the detail ... maybe you never will. However ... I do, and I am always moved.Dec 11, 2016 - just watched this movie yet again and, guess what ... by the end of it, I was blubbing like a fool. If the object of a movie is to affect you and make you think, this one does it in spades for me. That officially makes Field of Dreams absolute top of my movie hit list.",Field of Dreams
137,davekeanu,I guess dreams can come true,8,13 June 2016,I remember watching this in my RE class I found it rather interesting the plot is a bit of mistry of first on wanting to know what is going to happen. The character's are wonderful and I think it's great that we get a mistry film. That we do find out in the film that on what the guy was saying to the farmer make the field and he will come meaning that the farmer's father was going to return to play cricket on the farmer's field and being reunited with him. But I think the learning message in this film is that dreams can come true. overall this movie is very good in my book 8/10,Field of Dreams
138,kevino-4,One of my favorites,10,26 December 2000,"I have watched scenes over and over and still don't tire of it. James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster lend weight and quality. Costner is not my favorite but is the only imaginable actor in this role. The score is sparse but is also handled to maximum effect. But the most amazing thing about the movie is that it creates an emotional tone and builds it in complete concert with the viewer (at least this viewer) and never has a letdown. It is whimsy, mystery, humor, dedication, redemption, and faith expressed completely within the story line, with an emotional charge that explodes at the end as all unfolds well, perfectly. And it accomplishes all this so lightly that it isn't evident it is going on until that final mystical moment. If you haven't seen this movie run to the video store, rent it, then go home and lock your doors and turn off the phone. Alright, it helps if you love baseball.",Field of Dreams
139,asticht,Magic happens in life and on screen once in awhile,10,23 February 2004,"I watched Field of Dreams last night for what has become an annual tradition for me as spring training begins for Major League Baseball. I wore out my original VHS copy of the movie and needed to upgrade to a more durable DVD as it is one of the few movies I own that I could watch over and over. Field of Dreams to me is a reaffirmation of what is special not only about movies and how once in awhile a film comes along that really can reach the heart and touch so many people, but it also is a glimpse into what makes baseball arguably the most loved of all American sports. In the days of players salaries getting way out of control and major league owners trading for players to expand their rosters such as the recent New York Yankees trade for Alex Rodriguez, Field of Dreams for two hours sets aside all the aspects of money and focuses on the heart of baseball, and more so, focuses on the love of the game and how it touches so many people in so many different ways. Unless you absolutely hate the game itself and there are those who do, Field of Dreams will have something for anyone who cherishes the spring, when boys and girls across the country lace up their cleats and oil their gloves for the new season. Past losses and mistakes are gone, memories of our own childhoods are rekindled. The smell of a freshly cut field, the sound of the crack of the bat. All these things are reminded to the viewer of a film that has been voted one of the ten best sports films of all time. Even though the actual sport is depicted for only a few brief moments in the film, this movie is a baseball film through and through. But it is more so a film for the baseball fan, for those of us who can list the names of the players in the lineups from days gone past. This film is an indication that we can correct our own mistakes in our own past and hopefully find redemption in our lives. Ray Liotta and James Earl Jones both give very heartfelt and poignant speeches in the film reminding us of what the game does for the fan and even players who receive enormous amounts of money to play a game that they would probably play for free were there not salaries involved. This film is uplifting and moving and it reminds us of where we as Americans came from and how so many things in America have changed, but the game of baseball for all the innovations such as polyester uniforms and nighttime lights, baseball has changed little throughout its over 100 year lifetime. Yes, baseball in today's world is big business, but baseball was big business at the beginning of the century too, but when our favorite players hit the field and take their positions, or step up to the plate and knock the dirt off their cleats and take a few practice swings, it is still a game which is what Field of Dreams does a remarkable job in portraying. The acting in this movie is superb and natural, the characters are convincing and even though I have seen this movie at least three dozen times, I still get chills and am moved to tears at several points in the film. If there is ever a film that is destined to be a classic for years to come, Field of Dreams would definitely be one of them.I have been a huge fan of this film, probably more so than any other movie and each and every time I watch it I am drawn more and more into it. My family made a pilgrimage to the field last summer in Dyersville and if there are any persons out there who have never gone but are devotees like I am, it is absolutely necessary to make the journey. Field of Dreams is as enlightened of a screenplay as the original novel was by WP Kinsella. I only hope that there is the possibility of other great films to come where even 16 years after its release it still holds the same magic and can still cause me to get tears in my eyes as watch the last dramatic scene.",Field of Dreams
140,connmoore,Great American Cinema,10,28 April 2002,"This is one of the finest movies ever made, from any time.  The story of redemption and faith is touching, but not over the top.  This is by far the best acting job Kevin Costner ever does in his career.  You actually think Ray Kinsella is a decent man that you would like to get to know.  The music is perfect, and this film has some of the best cinematography ever done.  Do yourself a favor and realize that people that badmouth this movie, have either not actually seen it, have the attention span of a hyperactive spider monkey, or just plain don't like it when a movie makes them feel good.

Not one of my favourite films but one that touched me for a long time afterwards. I didn't know what to expect at the start but as the story took these unexpected twists and turns the more engrossed I got caught up in it. Ray's confrontation with Terence Mann, Ani Kinsella's spontaneous outburst at the PTA meeting, giving Archie Graham a lift to the game. It was all a mystery till right to the end.The most heart rending moment I guess was at the end. Not a dry eye in the house. Enough said. Without giving the story away I can only add a wistful hope, if only everyone had a second chance at saying what we really feel to our loved ones...before its too late.",Field of Dreams
142,GregRG,A Beuatiful tribute to an elegant game,10,6 January 2000,"There are not many films about talking cornfields, and that is probably a good thing.  In almost any other film, it would most assuredly be a case for snickering.  But Field of Dreams isn't any other film, and the talking cornfield begins one of the most beautiful and poetic pilgrimages ever shown on film. This film is about baseball, and it understands what all that love the game do:  It is not the game itself, but how in connects us to each other, and to the past, that makes watching it a religious experience.  The way the film moves us to that realization is slowly, lovingly, and with pure joy.  This film never comes close to stepping wrong.  While watching a scene where a Doctor gives up his dream to save a child, I noticed that I was hugging myself.  I was hoping that the rest of the film would stay as pure and as wondrous.  I needed not to worry.   In touching poetry, the meaning of the voice is revealed, and then it gives us a visually spine chilling last scene.  This is a perfect movie, and a beautiful tribute to an elegant game.",Field of Dreams

145,jacobconnelly-47681,"Should Be Sentinmental Hogwash, But It Works",9,16 June 2019,"I've been avoiding Field of Dreams like the plague since my parents, brother, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and even various strangers on the street told me it was one of their favorite movies. No, I wasn't going to be so basic. There was no way I was going to give this cheesy little baseball movie a chance, especially since I've never cared about sports one bit.I'm here to report that I finally have seen Field of Dream and my family, friends, and co-inhabitors on this earth were right - it's excellent.Kevin Costner plays an Iowa farmer who, one day, hears a strange voice calling to him from his cornfield. Strangely, the people around him only seem mildly alarmed when he starts doing what the voice tells him including building a baseball stadium out of his profitable cornfield, going on a road trip to find a reclusive author, and talking to the ghosts of dead baseball players. Hovering over the entire film is the shadow of Costner's dead father - a would be baseball star who never made it, aged early, and died before Costner got married and had a child.Field of Dreams has a ridiculous story anchored by several wonderful performances from Costner (especially considering I'm not usually a fan), Amy Madigan (who manages to steer her wife character away from the myriad ""supportive housewife"" cliches by the sheer force of her own personality and charm), and James Earl Jones (playing the reclusive author who might hold a connection to what Costner is going through).Thankfully, it's also not all about baseball. It uses that as window dressing, but Field of Dreams is much more interested in the relationships between parent and child and what becomes of our dreams when we take a different path in life. It all concludes with a moving, if slightly sentimental finale where you should have the tissues handy.",Field of Dreams

152,BronwynN,Learning to love many times over,10,9 November 2009,"I'm not sure if there are really spoilers herein, but I'd rather be safe.No one in my family ever liked baseball. I mean no one. Oh, sure, like everything non-South Sider, My mom rooted for the Cubbies. But I don't recall every seeing a baseball game on TV. When I got married, one of the things my husband and I had in common was an intellectual love for the Cubs and a disdain for the game. Until this day, the only games I've seen were at my mother-in-law's house because her love for the Cubs transcended reason (and I was forced into going to see the Milwaukee Brewers game one for a company function, but I didn't pay attention to the game).Then, in 1989, Field of Dreams was born. It took me a couple of years before it showed up on one of the premium cable satellites. But, one day when I had nothing to do, I finally watched it, and for only the second time in my whole life, I saw true -- really true -- magic (and no, I won't tell you what the first was, ever.) This is a film is not really about the love of a sport, it's just about love. It's about coming to terms with things that that have caused hurt throughout a lifetime; and it's about how love and wonder can make a person's belly feel full, her heart burst, and her brain at peace, no matter where in (or out) the universe that person may be.There are giggles and some real laughs spread throughout Field of Dreams (I particularly like Shoeless Joe telling Roy that Ty Cobb wanted to play but that the rest of the players wouldn't let him because of how much they despised the man in life), but the movie is not meant to be a comedy.And the last couple of minutes still make me cry, because I'll never find what Roy did.

Fast forward to a Saturday morning July 31, 2010. RAGBRAI, the most famous bike ride in America the rides across Iowa, was starting its 7th and last day in Manchester to Dubuque, Iowa, passing through Dyersville, the location of the Field. Several of the riders stopped and we had a pickup game on the Field. I had lost one of my sons to a tragic accident the year before, and had a truly wonderful warm thought from the movie playing on the Field that my catch was not with my dad, but my son. Tears came to me and the movie did it. I still had to ride the twentysome miles into Dubuque for the finish, and my eyes were not dry on that hot morning the whole way. My son was on that Field that day having a catch with me. The movie touched so many mens' hearts. Mine came 21 years after the movie came out. To do that makes it a special movie.",Field of Dreams

He builds a baseball field, thinking that Shoeless Joe Jackson will come back from the dead and play baseball once again. Stupid right? WRONG!! How can a stupid plot and storyline have such a positive impact on people. That's Field of Dreams. A movie about hope and the way father and sons bond. The last scene is a tear jerker.Field of Dreams is a great film. Terrance Mann, played by James Earl Jones, is an ex-writer and Ray goes looking for him.

156,BikeBill,It went the distance,9,3 April 2000,"There seems to be little that I could add to the hundreds of words in praise of this movie.   I watched it again over the weekend.  I've seen this film a dozen or more times, and even on commercial TV, chopped up as it was, it still has the power to bring tears to my eyes -- and they're starting to water again now, even as I compose this post.It does seem a shame that this movie did not win more awards, but this isn't the first time that has happened, nor will it be the last.  But awards do not necessarily reflect a movie's appeal, and I predict that people will be watching ""Field of Dreams"" for a long time to come.  I cannot believe, however, that this did not score higher in the top 250 -- especially when I see some of the movies that have outpolled it.All the comments about the corniness and hokeyness are true, in spades, but I can't imagine this film any other way.  Even the profound soliloquy by Terence Mann (and what better voice than James Earl Jones could have been found to deliver it?) on the meaning of baseball works within the context of this movie, and his pronunciation that ""People will come"" was eerily prophetic ... because almost immediately people started coming to Dyersville to see the Field for themselves.  And even today, more than ten years after the film's release, people are still coming to that small town in NE Iowa and driving out to see the Field, to touch the bases, and to warily peek into the cornfields in center field.This movie is a must-see for anyone, male or female, who considers themselves a baseball fan.  It also should be seen by 50-something fathers and their 30-something sons -- before the son finds, as did Ray Kinsella, that ""... he never had time to take it back"".  Then those fathers and sons should somehow find a way to ""go the distance"" to Dyersville and have a catch....One further comment -- within the past few years, I have come into possession of a commercially-produced documentary video, seemingly made for TV broadcast, detailing the making of the movie itself.  As best as I can recall it is entitled ""DreamField"".  I strongly recommend that you give this a viewing if you ever get the chance.",Field of Dreams

158,reporterman2000,One weird trip,7,19 August 2003,"""Field of Dreams"" has to be one of the craziest, weirdest movies ever made. I own it on DVD, but man, is it nuts. It requires a huge suspension of disbelief. This is the ""Star Wars"" of baseball movies -- no, the ""Close Encounters"" of baseball movies. A total fantasy unconnected in any way with reality. That it works is a miracle.I say it's like ""Close Encounters"" in that it's about an Everyman who has a brush with the otherworldly, and seems to lose his mind in a mad attempt to follow his passion. In the Spielberg film, Dreyfuss threw away his family to chase aliens. Here, Costner bets the farm, literally, on making contact with the ghosts of baseball legends past.This movie is funny and charming and contains some wonderful baseball scenes. Kevin Costner carries it with a goofy grace that he has long since lost. James Earl Jones again demonstrates his sensitive intelligence. Amy Madigan grates a nerve, but she's kind of tolerable toward the end. Really liked Ray Liotta as Shoeless Joe. The cast is terrific.But, geez, this guy plows under his cash crop, builds and lights a baseball stadium, and just sorta shrugs off the bank's attempts to foreclose on the mortgage. The whole movie is about Kinsella reconnecting with his dead father; he doesn't seem too worried about the living wife and child for whom he is responsible. ""Field of Dreams"" lands on the right side of movie magic, but in the real world, Ray Kinsella would have been divorced, thrown out of his house and ended up in the nuthouse for hearing voices. Not exactly a role model.",Field of Dreams

In fact, I watched the entire thing the first time simply because I wanted to see the next step in Ray's weird and unbelievable journey.  What's going to happen in Terrence Mann's apartment? Who is that old man with the cane?  It's a cliche'd, corny (haha, sorry, couldn't think of another word) plot, and yet it's fascinating...  Good always prevails, nothing ends with death, children have all the answers...what more can we ask for?  The acting wasn't great, although Ray Liotta's mystical portrayal of Shoeless Joe fascinated me.  But altogether, I felt the cast complemented each other nicely and it is just a great movie. And I definitely agree with the quote--I don't know if I could love anyone who didn't at least get teary-eyed at this movie.  7.5 out of 10.",Field of Dreams

The naysayers can pontificate all they want on its cinematic merits, but I don't give a ratsass. When I watch this movie I demand quiet and reverence. I'm not a baseball fan - heck, I'm not even a sports fan. But the simple matter is this movie speaks to a part of me that doesn't show.Just like in the movie where the characters wonder what their reason for being is, and then realize it in the end, the viewer is treated to the same odyssey. Every character in the movie adds to the total effect, and moves the story along, and without the character, no matter how minor, the story would be incomplete.Maybe because of my relationship with my own Dad; maybe because I've had the opportunity to visit the actual field used for the filming (it still exists, and yes, People Do Come), maybe it's the reinforcement in my belief there is a heaven - whatever the reason, this movie just makes me feel good.",Field of Dreams

Of course it is hokey, fictional but it is a great story that gets it right about relationships, second chances and just taking a chance. I wonder if the people who really hate this film hate it just to be different, dont like Costner or just really have no emotions about what most people find important in life. It was very nice to see a few comments from our friends in England who also enjoyed this movie realizing that you do not have to know a thing about baseball to get totally involved and sucked into the story about people not realizing how good they really do have it and how Ray Kinsella gets a second chance to make amends with his deceased father. Obviously we will not have this chance in real life but this movie may stir enough emotion in some to try to mend fences before they really do run out of time and not have to live with a person dying before they could take back something they wish they never said.",Field of Dreams
164,Cory Wilson,"Great Movie, but the book was better",10,30 April 2000,"""Field of Dreams"" is a great movie, and it is a classic.  It's everything America is about.  Baseball, redemption and humor.  I can't view this movie all that critically because I like it so much. It does have a few points that bug me though.  Shoeless Joe Jackson was the greatest left-handed batter of all-time, but here he hits right handed. That's an error that will really throw a baseball fan off. 
Personally I found Ray Kinsella's stance on Jackson irrational.  Shoeless Joe took money to throw those games, his batting average and home run during those games may not show that he was really throwing them, but his deal was made.  He did receive somewhere near $20,000 1919 dollars to fix the Series. He shouldn't be banned from the Hall of Fame though.I've never heard another comment on Ray Liotta's (Shoeless Joe) eyes in this movie.  He looked like a ghost, and looked very creepy almost.  His eyes are bright and clear and shiny.I really love this movie, and anyone who deson't like it needs to lighten up a little.  This is a very enjoyable film. The book that this was based off of ""Shoeless Joe"" by W.P. Kinsella, was actually better than ""Field of Dreams"".  Many more details are added, and the hokeyness of the film is changed to surreal fantasy in the book.  I highly encourage anyone who like the movie to read the book.",Field of Dreams

There are those who have never seen some of the greats like The Godfather or Cool Hand Luke, but it is not common to find anyone between the ages of eighteen and forty that has not seen this film.By the same token, it is not commonplace to find someone who actually dislikes this movie for whatever reason.  That is because it appeals to humanity in much the same way as The Shawshank Redemption.  It is a story that everyone can relate to, even if they have never heard of ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson or the Black Sox scandal of 1919.  It begs showcase the characters as people, not invincible secret agents or martial artists or the girl-next-door that falls for the loveable loser.

167,jandersonpwco,Perhaps best baseball movie of all time,8,12 June 2004,"As a huge baseball fan, I am generally not easy to please when it comes to cinematic presentations of the game, but Field of Dreams captures the enduring spirit that makes baseball special to its avid fans.  The broader story is enjoyable for non-baseball enthusiasts as well.  The story is slow at times, typical of Costner's work, and their are some historical gaffes that true baseball fans will pick up (a young ballplayer who is supposed to be ""called back"" from the early 20's era, recognizes Gil Hodges amongst the greats participating on the ""Field of Dreams"".  Hodges was a star of the '50s.)A brief but memorable final major cinema role for acting great Bert Lancaster is one of the film's highlights.

But I like it anyway, just because it's such a creative, boldly odd alternative to the typical Hollywood formula. Remember being a kid, dreaming up things with your friends that you all knew were totally out of the realm of logic or reality? Someone would inevitably say, ""but wouldn't it be cool if it really happened?"" And you'd all nod in agreement. That's what this movie feels like, and I applaud the grownups in and behind this film for being unabashedly transparent in their affection for a silly but likable daydream. If you go into this movie eager to rip it apart, you'll hate it. Maintaining the ""suspension of disbelief"" at the nearly ridiculous level Field of Dreams demands is a talent many people lack. But if you can manage to buy into it, you'll find that your willingness to follow along in the face of so much unreal pipe-dreaming will turn you into a participant, not just a viewer. At the end, you might find yourself nodding, ""yea, that'd be sooo cool.""",Field of Dreams

170,Mister_Anderson,This movie is one-of-a-kind magic,10,10 February 2005,"I am a harsh critic, but I give this movie 10 stars because it carries a magic with it that I haven't experienced in any other. Perhaps it's because the movie focuses more on Why the mysterious events happen more than How they happen (which is immaterial to the story).Koster is great at playing the everyman, and he lives up to his role here. I enjoyed Madigan as his wife. She seemed so full of life, and only such an enthusiastic wife would go along with the seemingly outrageous decisions that Ray makes.James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster really shine, capturing the scenes they were in, and they deliver their monologues flawlessly. For me, though, it's Ray Liotta as Shoeless Joe who steals the show. He is so mysterious and eerily knowledgeable, yet never poses a threat. He's like a twist of a guardian angel watching over Ray. It's hard to sum up his performance in words, and I'm surprised few commenters have mentioned Liotta.The overall impression one gets after watching this film, though, goes far beyond the acting. It's a movie about fate and a movie about choice, yet somehow the two don't contradict each other. It had my eyes watering by the final scene, and I'm sure I'm not alone.The movie is so...real. And that's an odd thing to say regarding a film about a talking cornfield.",Field of Dreams
171,dapplez,Not in the IMDb Top 250?,10,1 May 2011,"There's something I'd like someone to explain to me: How come Field of Dreams isn't anywhere on the IMDb top 250 movie list? It used to be. I think it might have been in the top 10 a few years ago. Now it's gone. With all due respect to IMDb and its posters, there's something wrong here.I wouldn't say Field of Dreams is No. 1, but it certainly is in my top 20, along with Harvey, Ground Hog Day and Being John Malkovich, all highly creative movies. Did I mention ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is No. 1? A good film, (with a gaping hole in its plot), but how many times can you watch it, after knowing the ending? Are most of the IMDb reviewers cons in the pen yearning to be free? Field of Dreams is a classic that has become part of our culture, part of our language. It is a movie you can watch again and again, and it still works, it still generates the same emotions, it still inspires you to dream.One of the most amazing elements of the film is that there really was a Moonlight ""Doc"" Graham. The yellowed obituary that the newspaper editor reads from was his actual obituary. His brother was the U.S. Senator and Governor of North Carolina, as I recall, but Moonlight gave up his family advantages to be a small town doctor.The scene of Burt Lancaster fading into the cornfield, his swansong on film, always brings tears to my eyes.It's hard to imagine how this film could be more perfect. If Field of Dreams is not a 10, what is? Well, Field of Dreams is 22 years old now, made before some IMDb reviewers were born. It's a very American film, and I notice the growing hatred of America in the world is, sadly, rubbing off on American cinema, kind of like people who hate Wagner's music because they don't like his politics (what they've been told are his politics).Anyone who refuses to watch great American films like Field of Dreams is the loser. I have lived abroad; I gave a copy of Field of Dreams to a co-worker, and in the entire year I was there, she absolutely refused to watch more than five minutes of it, and then said now she had ""watched"" it.This movie is threatening to people in some more traditional countries because it is about individualism, of being a non-conformist even when people might think you are crazy and stop talking to you. It is the antithesis of the Confucian group think of countries like Japan, Korea and China, and who knows what other countries.In America, individualism and non-conformity are held up as a high ideal to strive for. That's what this movie is about. Field of Dreams is the epitome of this theme that appears over and over in American cinema, in great movies like Harvey and High Noon. But in most countries in the world non-conformity is viewed as a bad thing, and so this movie might make adults feel uncomfortable.There's also the problem of a number of cultural references that might be meaningless to foreign viewers, like the Sixties, not to mention baseball, itself. The commentary track is one of the most interesting, but perhaps there needs to be another track for foreign audiences? I'll let you in on a little secret: I showed this movie to a class of foreign school kids, with appropriate subtitles, as a last minute bonus. I think they got it.When you think of it, Field of Dreams is a radical movie, radical in the Sixties sense. Adults might not like it, but it could inspire young people in other countries that there are possibilities to make wonderful changes in the world and in yourselves far beyond what your elders can imagine, if only you dare to dream and stick to your dreams, regardless of what others might say.",Field of Dreams
172,gartner,Great film; pop it in and enjoy the ride,10,9 February 1999,"""All his life Ray Kinsella was searching for his dreams, then one day his dreams came searching for him."" That was the tag line in the preview I saw for Field of Dreams in the spring of 1989.I remember thinking 'that looks interesting'. I had no idea that what seemed like an 'interesting' little film would end up being one of my all-time favorites.Field of Dreams is an amazing illogical, fantastic journey that never seems to be going where you think it is. Rather than get distracted in trying to figure out what is going to happen (like I often do upon first viewing), Field of Dreams is one film where I was just content to sit back in wonder waiting to find out where Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) and I were being led to.The film wastes no time with set up and supposition. ""If you build it he will come"" a strange voice whispers in the opening minutes of the film and Ray Kinsella, the Iowa farmer who is the only one who can hear the voice is just as perplexed as you are as a viewer. Without giving too much away, because of this voice Ray is led on a pilgrimage across America, that is seemingly all about baseball; but turns out to be really about something far more poignant and touching.A fine cast does an excellent job tip-toeing around the fragile confines of the story, somehow avoiding the corny or ridiculous. To a great degree what keeps Field of Dreams from becoming nothing more than an absurd excercise is that Kevin Costner makes his character so down-to-earth that he really seems like an ordinary person who has been placed in an extraordinary situation that is beyond his control or understanding.I loved Field of Dreams the first time I saw it and it has never lost it's luster in the countless times I've seen it since. I highly recommend it.",Field of Dreams
173,psikill,One of the Best Fantasy Flicks Ever Made...,8,6 March 2004,"Field of Dreams, directed by Phil Alden Robinson, is an interesting fantasy film that takes part mainly in Iowa. This fantasy film is about a man, Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner), who buys a farm. Alongside with him is his wife, Anni Kinsella (Amy Madigan) and his daughter (Gaby Hoffman).Spoilers:The story starts as Ray buys a farm, his long term dream, and, at some point, starts hearing a strange voice in his crop field, that orders him to do several things. And, as he does those things, he is somewhat rewarded for his effort. The voice tells him to build the main ""character"" in this movie: The Baseball Field. In fact, it is in this field (Field of Dreams), that the story mainly unfolds. On the field, he gets to know his all-time hero: Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta). The second time the voice talks to him, he gets to know Terence Mann (James Earl Jones), the famous-controversial-and-fed-up-with-giving-advice-to-people type of person. Strangely he hears the voice too. As the story progresses, Ray and Terence develop a strange but strong relationship, which Archibald 'Moonlight' Graham (Burt Lancaster) strengthens even more. In the end it all makes sense, what the voice said, and what it really wanted Ray to do. All in a climax of joy and fantasy.End of SpoilersThe plot is enough for a good, traditional fantasy movie, with no special twists and surprises. Pretty straight-forward, actually. Kevin Costner, probably in his second best film (after 'Dances With Wolves') gives an average performance. James Earl Jones gives a fair performance, and Ray Liotta doesn't fade away from the screen, in other words, he's sufficient enough for his role. The direction is typical for this kind of movies, no special angles or symbolism in the way it was made, but why would it be necessary? It doesn't require it, right? Overall, good job by Phil Robinson.Concluding, I recommend 'Field of Dreams' for a family reunion, or for a rainy afternoon. It is not a masterpiece, but it is entertaining. And, as all family movies are, it has a happy ending.Psikill's Rating: 8/10",Field of Dreams
174,Greg Lord,Pure Magic,10,4 June 2000,"Corn farmer Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) is working in his field when he hears a mysterious voice saying `If you build it he will come'. Naturally he thinks he's probably losing it but soon afterwards he has a vision of a floodlit baseball field where the corn should be. Ray is haunted by the spectre of his late father (from whom he inherited the farm), & is afraid that at 36 he is becoming just like like him, a man who he only remembers as being old before his time, who `never did one spontaneous thing in all the time I knew him'. Motivated by this fear & also by his having grown up in the 60's with it's embracing of free & spontaneous living, he decides to go ahead, plow down some corn & build the field. Ray decides that the he' refers to a famous baseball player named Shoeless' Joe Jackson, who was part of a team who accepted money to lose the 1919 World' Series. Although he took the money it was very clear from the quality & manner of his play that he was not playing to lose, but, along with most of the team, he was banned for life anyway. Ray felt the field was to somehow give him a 2nd chance to take up the game he loved & was perhaps unfairly prevented from playing  which is even more weird than building the field as Jackson died in 1951! Seasons go by & nothing happens, apart from from Ray & his wife (Amy Madigan) developing financial difficulties - caused mainly by the cost of building the field & the loss of revenue from the corn that the field replaced. Eventually Shoeless' Joe, or at least his ghost, (Ray Liotta) does find his way onto the field, along with the rest of his team, & they are happily knocking the ball about. The Voice' however hasn't finished with Ray & he feels directed to go to Boston to meet seminal 1960's author & civil rights activist Terence Mann (James Earl Jones), & take him to a baseball game  so off he goes.    Meanwhile the farm is in danger of repossession &  Ray is forced into making a decisionI think it's important to point out that this is NOT a film about baseball, despite appearances, & despite the game receiving it's fair share of passionate eulogising. This should come as a relief to us Brits, & to most non-Americans, as baseball - & the quasi-religious passion it seems to generate in the States - makes about as much sense to most of us as the English game of cricket does to the average American. Instead baseball is used as a metaphor to highlight the film's major themes, & used to brilliant effect.Now, I like to think I'm not a particularly sentimental type of guy; however, I've now seen Field of Dreams' 3 times, & every time I found it to be the most powerfully, gut-wrenchingly moving film I have ever experienced. It's done in a completely non-sentimental & non-cliched way - yet there are scenes & situations here that if you aren't at least touched by then, to paraphrase Bette Davis, you probably need to put your VCR where your heart should be'. I'm not going to spoil the ending by giving away too much detail, but Costner beautifully delivers a line there that I think ranks alongside Rutger Hauer's `Time to die' in Blade Runner' as probably the most moving in cinema history  made all the more so because of it's simplicity.  It's this simplicity that I think is one of the film's strengths; everything is beautifully understated & by this director Phil Alden Robinson allows the power of the story to create it's own impact. The dialogue is as you would expect from ordinary people talking in ordinary ways (albeit in an extraordinary context); the settings are banal; & the acting  particularly Costner  is beautifully understated to match. The cinematography is terrific & somehow manages to transform these very ordinary settings into magical places  places `where dreams come true' - & running throughout the film is a simple but hauntingly beautiful musical theme which complements the magical atmosphere perfectly.The screenplay too is superb  clever, politically astute, deeply moving & at times very funny. The scene where Ray 1st meets Terence Mann & tries to get him to come to a baseball game with him is one of the film's highpoints & is extremely funny & witty  two Hollywood heavyweights in top form slugging it out brilliantly. All the acting is first rate: Jones is as mesmerising as ever, Liotta is perfect as Shoeless' Joe, Madigan is ideal as the starry-eyed supportive wife, even Gaby Hoffman is terrific as their very young daughter, & there's an absolutely magical cameo by Burt Lancaster - but if ever anyone should doubt the star quality of Kevin Costner those doubts should be dispelled by his performance here. He is utterly convincing as an ordinary but open-minded guy dealing with heavy issues, & his performance is laid back & charming but at the same time charged with powerful emotional intensity.   One of the things that most struck me about this film is the perfect symmetry of it's structure: the story unfolds at just the right pace, & is rounded off in a climax which takes us right back to the film's beginning, tying up loose ends & brilliantly forcing us to view the story in a quite different light. The movie's major themes are echoed in a myriad of little touches  - this is a directorial tour-de-force.  It's the film's themes which really provide it's power  in a context of contrasting the idealism of the 60's with 80's cynicism & selfishness, it's all about having a 2nd chance at life, about being able to go back & correct past mistakes  particularly in relation to parents & family - about recreating the past, about being able to achieve long-held but unrealised dreams. By extension, given that this is impossible, the simple but profound message of this movie must be: sort your life out, take hold of your dream, even if it means going out on a limb & taking huge risks - & do it now cos it's the only chance you've got!

176,sternn01,Field of Dreams ...,10,17 May 2005,"Kevin Costner is Ray Kinsella, a simple Iowa farmer who receives a vision in his cornfield, along with a message...""If you build it, he will come."" This inspires him to build a ball diamond out in his corn, because he thinks that if he follows the voices' instructions, Shoeless Joe Jackson of the infamous Black Sox, will come back and play again. Of course everyone thinks he's nuts, but with the support of his loving wife (wonderfully played by Amy Madigan), he goes ahead and builds the ball-field. Then the magic starts. Shoeless Joe (Ray Liotta) does come back, along with several other legendary ball players, but Ray soon discovers that his journey is just beginning. Along the way he will meet Terance Mann (James Earl Jones) a retired writer and political activist, as well as the mysterious Doc Graham (Burt Lancaster), who played one game in the major leagues when he was a young man. These two men show Ray how baseball used to be, and why it's such an important part of our past. Of course Ray will have to make a decision regarding his field, and whether he will be able to keep it before the bank forecloses on his mortgage. And because he makes the right decision, he is rewarded, and it is one of the most touching and wonderful moments in a film thats rife with them.Unlike other films about baseball, this is not a movie about a specific game where you have the player on deck with two out and the bases are loaded. No, this is a film about life and family and the choices we make, and how the difficult decisions often affect others. Its a film for fathers and sons, and you don't have to be a fan of baseball in order to appreciate its beauty and message. It has been described as a baseball fantasy - and I suppose that is true to a point, but it is so much more than that.This film always moves me because sometimes I wonder if I am being as good a father as I can be to my own children. I think that this film illustrates that kids don't always need a father to be a bread-winner, although that is also very important. What it shows is that kids really want their dad to be a dad - someone they can play catch with, someone they can talk to or someone they can come to for comfort when they are sad. It also shows that there is forgiveness for fathers who weren't always the model dad they wanted to be.Based on the novel ""Shoeless Joe"", by Canadian author W.P. Kinsella, the screenplay was written and adapted by director Robinson - and his work here is quite the achievement as this was only the second film of his career. Thanks to some wonderful cinematography from DP John Lindey, as well as a hauntingly beautiful score by James Horner, this film is well on its way to becoming a classic of the American cinema, and deservedly so.""People will come Ray.

What sets it apart for me is the wistful lyricism of the film and its delineation of baseball as a means to discover one's self. The game no longer exists in this form, with no music between innings, with no glitz and hype, just the smell of grass, leather and oil, chewing tobacco and the sounds of the game. It is this game that is so beloved of ""intellectuals"" because it combines speed, power, individual achievement and failure within a team framework much more loosely structured than other team sports.

183,williams9,It's perfect,10,13 August 2021,"Once in a while, a film comes along that stands the test of time. It hits the notes just right, and it tells you something you didn't know but thought you did. They don't make films like Field of Dreams. There are no car chases or fist fights. The conflict might seem contrived and light. But, someone would make a film just like it every year if they knew where the magic that makes Field of Dreams special. Who knows exactly what it is?When this movie came out in 1989, I was 27. I had a friend who was going through a rough divorce and I took her to see this movie because I promised her it would renew her spirit. I think it did, if only for a moment.Not many films can do that. This one does.",Field of Dreams

Rough and amateurish, but I have been watching this movie a couple of times a year for a long time.I think the dialogue is right at where it should be. I never feel that the. Lines are giving the movie a bad name, because they don't!This movie is strip back into time, a surprising amount of depth and I need tissues at the end of every showing.Sure there are some small errors but it is so well done, in that it brings up the past with our parents from a Teenagers perspective, that I found myself thinking of my own Father and Mother. It reminds me that I always was such a self righteous git and I wish I had been a better Son. I hope you watch the movie, so don't ignore this one.",Field of Dreams
185,mgiese22-1,"""Is this heaven? No, it's Iowa.""",9,20 March 2007,"Since I was born, raised, and live in Iowa I just had to fall in love with this movie. Around here we are all very proud of this film. I live only about 30 miles from the Field of Dreams baseball field.Field of Dreams is the sort of movie that makes you realize that it's the magic of storytelling and the power of the emotions that hits you hard, which is why we like it so. This film is fantasy, pure and simple, including ghosts, time travel and magic. Yet it's interwoven with just enough real-world Iowa farm life to make it seem real.Kevin Costner deserves some credit for all this. Throughout Field of Dreams, you get the feeling that Costner's character, Ray Kinsella, is as unsure as we are about whether to buy what's unfolding.Ray is a half-hearted farmer whose business is in trouble. One day, he hears a voice while walking through his cornfield, and  with some support of his wife (Amy Madigan) decides to do what he thinks it's telling him. Ray ploughs up a field of corn and puts in a baseball field. Then he takes a spontaneous road trip to Boston. He kidnaps a famous author (James Earl Jones does an excellent job as the cranky but wise Terrence Mann).Ultimatey, Ray discovers what the voice was getting at, as he gains a deeper understanding of his own past, and a stronger bond with his history, his family and his future. Field of Dreams is easy to like if you like baseball. Even easier if you've ever stood on a baseball field and been at total peace with yourself. If you're from Iowa then no doubt you love this film. This is the ultimate baseball movie, even though it doesn't actually include a lot of baseball action. That's why this film isn't just for baseball fans. It's also for people who've experienced loss and want, to dream of regaining what was lost  of having the chance to say what you've always wanted to say but didn't. Ultimately, Field of Dreams is about the good things that America has lost touch with. It's about family, healing old wounds, and the beauty of a game that's clear to see why it's called America's pastime.",Field of Dreams

With the repeated refrain ""People will come,"" this speech alone constitutes one of the great moments in film history. It is comparable to the greatest speeches in the dramas of Shakespeare, Shaw, and the other greats of the theater. I can think of only two comparable moments in film history: John Quincy Adams' defense of the liberated slaves in ""Amistad"" and, of course, Rick's ""If that plane leaves the ground"" speech at the conclusion of ""Casablanca.""Even though we have a major-league baseball team just across the state line, some local investors are bringing minor-league baseball back to our area, and I'm looking forward to baseball being fun again.",Field of Dreams

192,postman-13,They don't make 'em any better,8,1 April 2000,"It's difficult to say if this is a baseball movie. It's really a movie about redemption and reconciliation, using baseball metaphorically. That being said, it IS the best baseball movie, ever. Granted, Ray and Annie at times seem to still be stuck in the '60's, (Annie actually says ""Far out!"", and Ray drives a VW microbus with a peace sticker on the windshield). Ex-hippies. Yikes. Also, I didn't realize Boston had such a large Jewish community. It looks as if that's all that's there.But these quibbles pale when you see the final scene. I won't give it away, I'll just say that I can't watch the ending with a dry eye, and I've seen it at least a dozen times.

193,justafanuk,A magical experience,10,26 September 2002,"This is the first time I've commented upon a film at IMDB, but after watching Field Of Dreams for the, ohh, dozenth or so time, I just wanted to share my ramblings and musings on this film. I first saw this film almost a decade or so ago, I was watching it alone on video after idly looking through some tapes for something. I was caught by the amount of glowing recommendations on the cover, and although it seemed to involve lots of baseball, something that I have never been even remotely drawn to, I thought I'd give it a chance. An hour and 40 minutes later and I had dissolved into a steam of tears, that were only broken up by the smile stretched right across my face. To me, this is the closest film I've seen that I would consider being perfect. My favourite film is The Godfather, with Godfather Part Two right alongside, but no film gives me such an emotionally rewarding experience as Field Of Dreams. This truly is a film dipped in magic waters. Why do I love this film so? The acting right across the board is naturalistic and strong. We believe the characters when they say what they say and do what they do. The whole tone and design of the film let us believe in the choices the characters make, we want Ray to build the field and have Shoeless Joe appear, we want Terrance Mann to go Finway Park with Ray, we want Archie Graham to get to play his dream, and most of all, even though we don't expect it or see it coming (well I didn't), we want Ray to get to throw a catch with his dad.> The design, again, is wonderful. The lighting, and cinematography make your eyes and your heart ache, the magic hour lighting, the little break in Ray's voice when he asks his dad if he wants to have a catch, the moment Doc steps over the field and into the present to save Karin, when Mark mouths ""What the f..."" upon first seeing Doc Graham, the score, the fact that they talk about smoking grass and trying acid in what is essentially a family film in content and marketing, when Archie Graham gets picked up on the way back home and says ""Hi, I'm Archie Graham"", the sheer  MAGIC!!! Anyone thinking they may even be slightly put off by thinking the film is a baseball film, don't be. It's not about baseball, the sport serves as the backdrop for a story about loss, reconciliation, parents and family, dreams and having the courage to go through them. It really is a universal and timeless film, which is a cliched saying, but this is really one of those cases where it more than justifies the comment. Simply beautiful.",Field of Dreams
194,yisraelharris,Beautiful Film,10,10 June 2006,"It is truly a rare movie indeed to which I would give a 10. But this is one of my all-time favorites.This is a movie about themes like reconciliation, destiny, redemption, idealism, disappointment, the difficulty of relationships, especially that of the father-son relationship.In this movie, the baseball field is where all such issues achieve resolution.This is such a gentle movie, full of such sincerity, and moving emotions. Although it is by no means an upbeat movie, it is nevertheless ultimately a very optimistic and positive movie.As some reviewers have noticed, some suspension of disbelief is required.A movie with no guns, violence, gangsters, no gratuitous sex, just down-to-earth good people, and a good message. What a gem.P.S. Interestingly, there really was a Moonlight Graham. See his baseball career stats here: http://www.baseball-reference.com/g/grahamo01.shtml.

The movie starts off without much off a prologue. We find ourselves,suddenly in the midst of an out of the world experience. But the strangest part is, that it all makes sense (in some weird way)..The acting is of course,extraordinary.But more than that,the direction is to be the most complimented part of this movie.

It's a 10 out of 10 except for one element- Joe Jackson's persona. So, I gave it a 9.  I'm not sure why the filmmakers decided to make the character of Joe Jackson resemble a New York wiseguy, using Ray Liotta as the actor who portrays Jackson. I've lived here in Greenville, SC, where Joe was born and raised, and died for almost 20 years and it's a real disservice to Joe Jackson's legacy to portray him so inaccurately. Jackson was a southern boy. He was taught the game by a Confederate Civil War veteran. I can only assume that the southern personality wouldn't fit with the others... I don't know. I think it would have made the film even better if they'd allowed the audience to experience Shoeless Joe exactly as he was in real life.Of course, that element will go unnoticed by almost anyone who watches the film.

I was so tired when I watched this film, yet I managed to remain wide awake throughout.The acting was a stunning feature of this movie, and even more amazing was that it wasnt entirely within the dialogue. It was the emotion on their faces, particularly that of Ray Liotta and Kevin Costner that struck me. That interaction between their expressions led me into another world. When ""Shoeless Joe"" first came to Costner's ballpark, it was this classic look of amazement and reminiscence, and that combined with the look on Costner, like a kid looking up to his hero, was spectacular. The storyline was so warm-hearted and simple and loving. It was inspirational in any way you wanted it to be, and the final scene with Costner and his Dad was a moment to be treasured in film, as was James Earl Jones speech about the pure beauty of a game like baseball. Although this was a baseball film, it had so much more in it, and you need not place it in this category. I recommend this to everybody, and watch it with a warm heart, then prepare to be filled with enjoyment and satisfaction. It will make you smile, and make you cry.

207,silvercreature,"Uninspired, wishy-washy drivel",3,29 September 2004,"This beloved movie has irritated me for years. I'd seen it many years ago, before knowing just how popular it is and didn't really have much of an opinion on it one way or another.However, within the past year, I've twice viewed it and I now feel compelled to say that the fact that it has such a favourable score on this site, along with dozens of glowing reviews, is absolutely baffling to me.I have no idea how this movie can appeal to anyone on any level. The fact that it's managed to ensnare its fair share of people who aren't even really into baseball is even more disturbing because I always figured that if you're fiercely devoted to a sport, you can make yourself like any movie that paints it in such a positive and mystical light.Many reviews on this site state that this movie isn't really about baseball, but is instead about deeper things such as family, regret and what it means to live. I can see how the movie may ATTEMPT to be about these things, but it fails quite miserably.I should also point out that this movie is based on an extremely poorly written book. If you don't believe me, pick it up and try to force yourself to read the entire thing - it's quite a painful experience. The movie obviously changes some things from the book as all movie adaptations of novels do but it certainly doesn't make things any better. The plot is still a lazily slapped-together mash of events that are either cheesy and bland beyond belief or simply nonsensical (and quite often, both at once!)I've seen movies in which a character is compelled to do something fairly out of the ordinary and is criticized for it by his peers before (in this case, a mysterious voice give Kinsella extremely vague instructions that he decides he MUST follow) but in those films and stories, the character actually winds up ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING in the end. Building a baseball field so that the spirits of a bunch of deceased baseball players who played more than enough of the game in their respective lifetimes can come together and play again strikes me as utterly pointless. True, as James Earl Jones' character puts it in the end, ""the people will come without knowing why and they'll pay twenty dollars each or more just to see"" - the final shot proves that this is what's happening and it does solve the problem of Kinsella going bankrupt. However, the whole reason he's broke is because he built the field on his farmland, thusly destroying his livelihood! That's pretty circular, doncha think? Pointless? What has he really gained in the end? A chance to play catch with his father? I realize how that can be a meaningful thing but I question whether or not that justifies the entire movie.As far as I can tell, nothing justifies pretty much any of the paranormal crap that goes on in this film. I know there are tons of movies with magic and over the top stuff that rely on the suspension of belief - hell, a lot of my favourite movies are quite fantastical and weird - but all that stuff seems extremely out of place in this movie. There's no explanation for any of the stuff that occurs and everything happens so haphazardly that it comes across as though the author just made it all up as he went along. Example: on his insane quest across the country for Jones' character, the reclusive author (in the book he was J.D. Sallinger - I have no idea why the filmmakers saw fit to change that), Kinsella suddenly, without warning, warps through time to the early seventies where he meets a former baseball player who is now an aged doctor. Kinsella isn't surprised in the least by this, I might add -Costner wanders through the events of the movie with this terrible, spaced-out look but never shows any range of emotion beyond that - and he asks the doctor to accompany him back to Iowa. (which reminds me - ""Is this Heaven?"" ""No, it's Iowa."" how can you hear lines like that and not vomit?) The doctor declines. Not to worry, because on the drive back, Kinsella inexplicably encounters another incarnation of the doctor in the present timeline (in which he would be quite dead) as a much younger man, practically a boy, and picks him and takes him back to the farm where he will perform the immeasurably important and earth-shatteringly significant act of playing baseball with a bunch of other dead guys. (and don't tell me he saves the girl's life - he wacks her on the back!)I could go on and on, taking this movie down scene by scene but I won't bother. I will, however, point out that the filmmakers did a remarkable job of representing Kinsella's wife as she is portrayed in the book - that is, an insepid halfwit who stands by her husband's lunatic actions and is more effective as background colour in scenes than as a character. The added scene depicting the PTA meeting must be the filmmakers' attempt to somewhat animate her character but, as it has pretty much nothing to do with the rest of the plot, it just comes across as annoying. I realize that in that scene they mention the reclusive author but that only works since the author's identity was changed from that in the book in the first place.I applaud anyone who is passionately involved with a sport on some level - it's a great feeling and I think that sports can mean a lot more than just a bunch of guys playing a meaningless ""game"". That said, I feel anyone who's really into baseball should be angry that this movie exists. If anyone made a movie this bad about a sport I love, I'd be beyond horrified.Of course, everyone is entitled to their opinion and I know there are scores of you who will disagree with me. But I'm yet to read a review on this site at least, where anyone comes even close to describing the merits of this movie. I hate to say it, but a lot of people come across as though they've simply been brainwashed either by an obsessive love for baseball (which probably isn't a bad thing on its own) or by the fact that the movie tries very hard to be emotionally compelling or perhaps a mixture of both.As far as sappy movies go, this isn't the worst, but the fact that it's sappy as hell with a whole bunch of meaningless, paranormal garbage thrown in definitely makes it the most annoying. Anyone who says that they were ""moved"" by this movie would probably go nuts over the book, what with all the horrible clichés, awful dialogue and bland, uninspired imagery that couldn't be crammed into the movie.Avoid at all costs unless the thought of ghost baseball players coming to life to stand around, scratch themselves and spit all over again makes you tear up. This movie's popularity will forever shake my faith in humankind.",Field of Dreams
208,max4858,"Wonderful, beautiful, and magical",10,20 October 2020,"What can I say about ""Field of Dreams"" that hasn't already been said? As others have said, it's not a prefect film, but is there such a thing? As my title suggests, this film is wonderful, beautiful, and magical. It touches my heart and makes me cry every time I see it.The acting is superb. As the years go by, I have more appreciation for Kevin Costner all the time. He is simply perfect as Ray, not too bright, totally naive, with a good heart and a strong will. James Earl Ray is perfect as Terrance Mann, the writer ""kidnapped"" by Ray to go see a ballgame at Fenway Park. Amy Madigan was never better as Ray's spunky, supportive wife and Timothy Busfield, years before ""The West Wing,"" is great as his befuddled brother-in-law who can't understand why Ray would plow over his corn and build a baseball field on his farm.As great as they all are, they are outdone by Ray Liotta and Burt Lancaster. Liotta is a Hollywood enigma in my opinion. Fantastic as he was in ""Goodfellas"" and this film, he has all but disappeared. As Shoeless Joe Jackson, he is mysterious, wise, and amusing. Burt Lancaster has always been one of my favorite actors, with an Academy award under his belt (for ""Elmer Gantry"") and numerous other nominations for films like ""Birdman of Alcatraz,"" ""Atlantic City,"" and ""From Here to Eternity."" This is the old man Burt, no longer young and virile, but wise, kind, and all-knowing with a twinkle in his eye. He is touching and sensitive as Doc Graham and you find yourself wishing he was your own grandfather. Although this is only a small supporting role, he is as great in this film as he was in his iconic leading man roles of the 50's and 60's.And, finally, I love what this movie is truly about, fathers and sons, and their connection to baseball. My dad brought me up on baseball, one of the most glorious moments of my life was when my Little League team won the championship in 1969. At the end of the film, when Ray, with a catch in his throat the size of a watermelon, asks his father if he wants to have a catch with him, I find myself crying every time I watch the film. What I wouldn't give to be able to have a catch with my long-dead father. Just once.This film is pure magic. From the fantasy elements of the story, the connection to baseball, the themes of fathers and sons, the great acting, the beautiful photography, and the wonderful musical score. It all comes together in a film that is wonderful, beautiful and magical. One of my all-time favorites.",Field of Dreams
209,Rad_Dad_83,A Baseball fairytale that I almost dismissed,8,22 May 2021,"I grew up in the early 90's with baseball being my first love in sports. I have many fond memories of my sandlot days that I cherish to this day. In general, The 90's were just an incredible time to enjoy sports! I was an Atlanta Braves & Chicago Bulls fan! What a decade that was ! In addition to great sports, the early 90's produced a lot of great and enjoyable sports films. I am old enough to have seen Field of Dreams on TV many times, but never did. I'm actually kind of glad that I hadn't seen it til now. I really don't think that I would have appreciated or understood it in my youth as much as I have now (37). I'll admit, I wasn't immediately in love with this movie the first time that I watched it. I was rather confused and annoyed by it. But over the years, I've come to really appreciate and enjoy these kinds of films. Films that make you look deeper and challenges you to look for deeper meaning. I think it's a skill that comes with age or at least matures better over time. So as I started to think more critically about the movie and it's meaning. I eventually was able to appreciate and understand it's message. After years of passing on this film and coming in completely blind about what this movie was about. The first watch was very hard for me. I couldn't make sense of what I was watching? I knew it was a movie about or involved baseball, but in what universe? It felt very reminiscent of an episode of the Twilight Zone. As painful as it was, I stuck with it and I'm very happy I did. I completely sympathize with those who have watched this once and hated it. I almost did! But it is a movie that honestly deserves repeated viewing to really understand and appreciate it. Is it a baseball movie ? Yes, but it's actually about so much more! It's about something we've all at one time or another fantasized about or dreamt of. To relive an emotion or dream we had once. Even if just for a little while. A moment to remember an innocent or better time. Or just to feel like a kid again. We don't have to live in or relive the past, but it's ok to take a trip back every now and again!",Field of Dreams
210,atroyz,Best Film of the 80's,10,13 February 2000,"This film breaks almost all the boundries of a hollywood movie, yet still managaged to be nominated for best picture in 1989.  Perhaps it is the 80's best film because it has nothing to do with the 80's, nor does it take place in any particular decade, nor does it require ""modern"" elements (which, as everyone knows, look 'dated' once the film is 5 years old).  This is not a ""Kevin Costner movie"", but he delivers a fantastic, if subdued performance. This is not a ""sports movie"" with a big-game payoff, but it revolves around baseball, treating it more like an old friend than an athletic institute. It's hard to define this film, and it's trying to define it is beside the point, for this film is an extremely entertaining, well crafted, and yet still artistic piece of work.  I'm afraid to say something like ""I wish there were more movies like this"" because there will never be another movie like this, nor should there be.  I will say, however, ""I wish there were more movies that made me feel the way this one made me feel about movies.""",Field of Dreams

The history of the game comes alive in the movie, and the story of Shoeless Joe and the Black Sox is brought back to life.  The movie is very emotional for me especially when Doc Graham sacrifices his dreams to save Karen's life and also at the end when Ray Kinsella plays catch with his dad.  The music is so beautiful and causes strong emotions to form.  If your dad taught you how to play baseball, this movie will move you.  If you love baseball history, you will like this movie.

The entire cast was wonderful (my only favorite Kevin Costner role), and Ray Liotta and Amy Madigan were especially terrific. But Jones & Lancaster showed a truth and honesty in their performances that were unequaled, except to each other. Jones was so natural as to have actually BEEN Terrence Mann. The idiosyncracies of his movements and his speech were infectious and completely believable. Lancaster, as ""Moonlight"" Graham, gave one his finest performances ever and, to me, BECAME one of the most lovable screen characters I've ever seen.See this movie for James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster but also see it because it will not only warm your heart, it will inspire you. This movie really isn't about baseball -- it's about what you dream for yourself in life, whatever it might be, and it will lift you spiritually in ways you cannot know.

This is a movie that should be at least in the top 100 moives and im sad to say isnt even in the top 250! Everyone knows the whole story so I wont bore you with the details. The role of Ray Kinsella could not have been better played than it was by Kevin Costner who I feel is a very underappreciated actor.  The rest of the cast carry the movie along quite well also, but its Kevin's acting that makes the film a masterpiece.

A movie with no guns, violence, gangsters, no gratuitous sex, just down-to-earth good people, and a good message. A great gem for anyone. This is not just a baseball movie. It really hit home that it was just a awareness that we are all flawed, the expectations we have for our parents sometimes too high, especially when we grow up sometimes we aren't able to achieve. This is also about having a second chance to say hello to Dad. To enjoy doing something he enjoyed and and what his father before him enjoyed, but you were too young to maybe appreciate what that moment meant at the time. I had started to realize how much baseball is a American past time near the end of the movie after James Earl Jones speaks about it.

The acting isn't that noteworthy, the sets and general production choices aren't that impressive, and the cinematography isn't particularly spectactular.Regardless, it tugs at my heartstrings in exactly the right way. It's secular, but sacred. It's grounded, but mystical. This is the kind of movie you want to watch when you feel too cynical- it will remind you that magic does exist in real life, and not the JK Rowling kind. It's the kind that actually matters and will show itself to you if you believe in it.It's almost a cliche at this point, but this movie isn't about baseball. It's about dreams, about making peace with your past, and why standing by your convictions even if you know they're wrong can be good. If you go in with the right mindset, I 100% guarantee this movie will make you feel good. Field of Dreams makes you feel joy, but also a little bit sad, in the best possible way.

226,dwmarshall1,A cathartic film,10,28 June 2006,"I've just joined the club and the first film I felt the need to comment on was this, ""Field of Dreams"". Why? Because, firstly, it's haunted me since its release and secondly, because it had such a cathartic effect upon me. Like so many young people, I lost my dad when I was in my teens. I was fifteen. I'm fifty-nine now. The lost opportunity, the grief, cling to you like lead. When you need to discuss the paradoxes of this world with someone, you find they are gone. They will not return. Though by no means a perfect film - would we ever really want to see a perfect film? - it has heart, a centre to it that opens gateways for those bereft, even though unaware, by loss. I remember watching it the first time on the back row of a cinema with my ex-wife - long after back rows had any import - and, at the end, having to physically contain the need to sob uncontrollably. This had never happened to me before (unless you go back to Elvis riding into the hills at the end of Flaming Star when I was but a snivelling - and probably dysfunctional - early teen. The movie is a masterpiece in that it lives with you decades after its first viewing. In that you cannot analyse it, breaking it down cynically into manipulative parts. I've seen thousands of films and with each one that I feel has entered my soul I always ask myself, has it reached beyond Field of Dreams? In some respects the answer is yes, yet these are technical analyses of product. I've never had to do that with Field of Dreams. It is itself and defies scrutiny as would Gandhi defy psychoanalysis. It is, to itself, true. The cast are great. To this day, despite much, I like Kevin Costner. My sole concern is, why the hell can't I buy ""Shoeless Joe"", the novel upon which it was based and which I read in the late eighties? It contains much more background and is, in itself, an absorbing read. Dave Marshall",Field of Dreams
227,crscountrykid,"""He's Plowing Over His Corn! Da*n Fool!""",9,3 February 2009,"""Field of Dreams"" is by far one of the best sports movies ever made and maybe the best. It is a timeless tale of family, spirit, believing, and of course baseball.Kevin Costner is astounding in the role of Ray Kinsella, a farming family-man in Iowa who hears a strange and now iconic voice telling him to build a baseball in his corn field. The field is built and magically, baseball legends from the past, mainly the 1919 ""Black Sox"" team appear right in front of Ray's eyes. But, there is something more than just building a field to Ray as the voice keeps whispering signals to him.Amy Madigan plays Anne Kinsella, Ray's wife and supporter of his dreams. She is stout, sarcastic, and is portrayed pretty well by Madigan.James Earl Jones portrays Terrence Mann, a novelist from the 1960's who befriends Ray after a previous, nearly violent encounter.If you are sports fan and a movie fan alike, this movie comes highly recommended from everyone who has watched it.

Although I thought this was amusing at first, I later realized that this is truly not a movie for a middle-ground rating. You either get it and are touched or you wonder to yourself why someone would make a movie about baseball players in a cornfield in Iowa.

However this seems to be the worst well reviewed movie. A lot of people thought it was great; I just found it to be moronic. The reluctant corn farmer (played by Kevin Costner) hears voices telling him to build a baseball field in his corn field. He somehow is able to obtain the lights and necessary equipment to do so. Don't even try to make sense of any of the logic in this movie - there isn't any. Once the field is built a bunch of ghost baseball players come out of the cornfields to play ball. However only a few people (probably those who have used LSD) can see them.Through it all despite the fact that his loss of cropland used to build this ball is going to cause the them to lose the farm Costner grinds on with steely resolve. Farmer Costner's wife played by some actress that I thankfully have never seen before.) supports him all the way with a kind of annoying perkiness and pluck that she must have learned from watching tapes of Kathy Lee Gifford and Katie Couric. As this ludicrous farce progresses Costner drives off to pick up a washed-up hippy author played by James Earl Jones. The character of Jones has nothing to do with the plot of the movie but apparently those who made it just wanted him in the movie. Costner and Jones then pick up the ghost of a ball player turned doctor (played by Burt Lancaster.) Lancaster loved being a doctor but always regretted giving up playing ball now he has a second chance until he save Costners daughter from choking on a hot-dog. She was accidentally pushed off the bleachers by the farmers evil banker brother-in-law who has come to foreclose on the farm's mortgage. Once Lancaster has become a doctor to save the child's life he can no longer play ball. As I wrote before don't even try to figure out this. films logic. Everything ends well however since there are cares lined up in front of the farm to pay 20 dollars to watch ghosts play baseball. the ghost of Costner's character's father, a one time ball player then shows up to play catch with his son - Oh how sweet!

And through the ""magic"" of baseball we see just about every major character (Ray, Terrence, Shoeless Joe and Moonlight Graham)finding redemption though the game itself. And Ray's final redemption- the game of catch with his father, ranks, to me, as one of the most memorable moments in all of moviedom.Why this particular film doesn't make IMDb's Top 250 list remains a mystery, especially considering some of the choices on the list ahead of it. (Pirates of the Caribbean: Black Pearl and Heat being two of the pieces of tripe that made the list). 500 voters gave this film a ""1"" vote.

I saw Field of Dreams on Father's Day following its release, having no clue how the issue of father-son relationships would be addressed in the film.  By the time the closing credits were rolling, this film had left a lasting impression because I could  identify with so many of the themes in the film. The acting is fine/adequate, and as a whole this film may not compare to the ""greats"" I've previously mentioned.  But it delivered in a powerful way with things I can relate to and treasure.

But I knew at about age 12 I would never be good enough for that. Eventually I became a journalist, not an award-winning journalist like Terrence Mann, but one who enjoyed documenting people's triumphs and tragedies. That's basically what ""Field of Dreams"" is all about for me. It features the ups and downs of life, and how we handle the good and the bad through life's journey. This is one of those movies that brings out many kinds of emotional responses as you watch it. I especially love the scene when James Earl Jones delivers his message about baseball and how it has marked the time in America. He has the perfect voice for reflecting on how baseball represents the innocence in us. I became a huge baseball when it was instilled in me as a 5-year-old child. And my love for this game has never wavered despite all the ugliness in today's professional game that exposes it mostly as a multi-billion dollar business where team loyalty is disregarded. When I attend a ballgame (pre Covid-19), all that ugliness is temporarily forgotten about as I ""walk out to the bleachers, sit in shirtsleeves on a perfect afternoon"".

When I saw it again, he had been dead for over a year, and I cried like a baby.I'm English, so for me the baseball element was lost, but what did hit home was the awareness that we are all flawed people, and the expectations we have for our parents, are way and beyond what we achieve ourselves as we grow older.The film is not about baseball, it is about a second chance ! An opportunity to say hiya Dad, I was didn't know then, but I'm older now and understand more about the way the world works.In terms of the film, Cosner has never had a better role, Lancaster as Doc Graham finally showed what a great actor he really was, and James Earl Jones was simply perfect.In short a great film, James Horner's theme music is wonderful, the visuals are fantastic, the acting is as good as you could hope to see.For most this is a feel good movie, for me this is a reminder that it is never too late to make amends, I just miss my Father",Field of Dreams

It's a bit of old tonic, for a new age.Ray Kinsella is a Iowa corn cropper, looking for something beyond the crops and fields surrounding him.  One day he finds redemption in a voice from the sky; ""If you build it, He will come . . .""The Iowaian decides to follow the voice with reckless abandon and devotion.

241,javery55,"""If you Build it, They will come.""",10,3 August 2016,"You know, upon first glance of ""Field of Dreams"" you will laugh. 'Angels come from a corn field in Iowa.' Somewhat laughable, right? However, turn on the movie and you will realize this is something so much more. With a heart of gold and a subtlety in the plot that is truly magic one will easily see the importance of ""Field of Dreams"".Kevin Costner performance is great, in a role that is somewhat new role, yet very comfortable, almost as seeing an old friend in Ray Kinsella. I say new role (even though he does a baseball film every couple year) because Ray is not eccentric or overly heroic as in some of his movies in the past. Rather a subtle farmer who is going through a sort of mid life crisis and begins a journey through the mid-west in the name of baseball.There are two characters/actors that over shadow Costner's good performance. First, James Earl Jones, who not surprisingly give a convincing role as a reclusive author based on the real JD Salinger. Jones epic voice adds narrative and context to the film. The Second character is from Burt Lancaster as 'Doc' Graham, a character who deep in his heart is longing for one more game of baseball. 'Doc' is actually based on a real character, who's story alone would make a heart wrenching movie, he becomes part of the big picture.The downer, if any, comes from Shoeless Joe's character in Ray Liotta. He never felt real to me, as a baseball player, as a member of the 1919 White Sox, or as a human at any point in the film. Although he is an important part of the film, there is a little need for more in this undeveloped character.As many know, ""Field of Dreams"" is based on the book ""Shoeless Joe"" by WP Kinsella. After watching the film I was then drawn to the book, which I finally read about eight ears after first watching the film. It gave me a new interpretation of the film, and in fact I found the book much better and more complete characters then the film. So, in my opinion, you cant have one without the other.We realize about half way through the film, baseball is not the plot of the film, or even the most important thing to gain from the film. Rather, something more important, a longing for the different time in our lives, our individual past and a longing for what it is that makes us who we are. Looking a bit further, it is of a father and son/daughters bond. Whether it is through baseball or something else.""Hey Dad, You wanna have a catch?""",Field of Dreams

The central theme of this movie is about regret and having the opportunity to get second chances. Even though the audience doesn't learn till the end of the movie what Kevin Costner's character's regret and redemption is, we experience some amazing and interesting co-starring wonderful characters (with Ray Liotta ""Shoeless Joe"" and Burt Lancaster's as the country doctor). The actors James Jones and Amy Madigan keep the storyline so well grounded, and only at the end of the movie does the magic we have been waiting for really take off. Kevin Costner is just brilliant to watch in this movie. This movie has to be one of his better performances that he has ever given. There was the potential to get all sappy and go over the top with his role, but much to my satisfaction he keeps everything even keel.

244,amctcm,"Baseball, science fiction, romance of America",10,6 March 1999,"As a casual baseball fan, who does truly love the game, I realized how much I see it as a major symbol of America when I listened to James Earl Jones, aka Terrence Mann, give the soliloquy about the game toward the end of the film. It truly does go on as something basically good and fine, even through the scandals. I cry every time Ray meets John, no matter how much I try to fight it.  Who doesn't giggle when Mann enters the corn field, knowing we'd like to go there too?Who doesn't get the same choking up when Ray realizes that Doc Graham can't play again?  Who doesn't remember times that people like Mark have refused to ""see"" things that require  faith.The casting of this film was true genius.  Every single time I watch it, I see more.  Unfortunately, when I show it to my seventh grade students, I do have to ""zap"" out the PTA meeting because of the language.  Teachers...it works; the kids love it!Watch it again and again...for the baseball, for the science fiction, for the metaphors about the game, and for the sheer fun of being a kid again and not worrying if it makes sense!",Field of Dreams

When I stop and think about it, it's laughable but the immutable truth is that this is naively beautiful on almost every frontier.  I have watched this film so many times and though inside I know the ladled sentiment should be cringeworthy-especially for a cynic such as I...it somehow never fails to utterly absorb me.Horner's musical score is haunting and mesmerising and adds so strongly to the whole ethereal feeling that this film exudes.The acting is extraordinary in that they pull off corny lines without provoking me to laughter or cringing, with the possible exception of James Earl Jones speech  ""...the one constant is baseball..."".I even have to admit that Kostner is good (painful though it is).You may not like or understand baseball...it doesn't matter.  This is not a film about baseball. Its about relationships (particularly about father son relationships) and it tugs on every heart string.There was a review of this film which first intrigued me enough to watch it several years ago.  I cannot remember who said it but if memory serves me well his summation of Field of Dreams was this...""Could you ever really love someone who didn't cry at this film, even just a little?""Nuff said.",Field of Dreams

It was the first time in a while that a film had brought up such emotion, and it felt great. This film in no way requires the viewer to have any interest in the sport of baseball, but i believe that a love for Americana greatly helps the movie to envelop you, as it did me.  I wanted to be there, I wanted to be with the characters, I wanted to run on a baseball diamond, ...but most of all, i wanted my father to be there.

Now - Ray is having problems paying the mortgage on his farm and apparently he needs all the farmland he can get. Straight out of the story 'Jack and the Beanstalk' Ray builds a magic ballpark on his farm instead of growing corn. This decision ends up causing him to lose the farm later in the movie (tho the magic ballpark looks only big enough to displace, what? a couple hundred dollars worth of corn?). by now we're beginning to wonder where in the world this story is going, what's the point of all this, who's on first? We were expecting fast and down the middle, and then writer-director Phil Alden Robinson throws a golden screwball. And boom, next thing you know, Ray's left Annie to fend off bankruptcy alone while he drives to Boston to meet with famous author Terence Mann (J.D. Salinger in W.P.

This is a heart warming story of a man getting a second chance with the relationship that he regrets ruining with his father. He grew up during a rebellious 60's and knows he was wrong about his father. he gets a second chance through baseball, America's past-time. James Horner goes overboard in the music. It is an amazing soundtrack. It is rare that music fits a movie this well. Kevin Coaster is absolutely at his best and the casting is perfect for all th roles. This movie is quite simply one of the most dead-on movies about a sport or relationships, or second chances that anyone could hope for.

With blind faith he goes along with what is asked of him even though he's not sure what is going on. It's about baseball but it's really about so much more. It's about why it's important to put preconceived notions aside. It's about listening to THE VOICE, It's about transformation, It's about our journey through this plane of existence, It's a little bit about the other side and it's a lot about love and healing. I watched it again last night and thought this time I won't cry but I did. For some reason this movie reaches deep into me and won't let go.",Field of Dreams
255,bluetrain1968,Why do we love it,9,4 September 2004,"Please do not pay to much attention to the last review. This movie is a fantasy movie with baseball as the backdrop about how important the sport can be in ones life and their relationships. (but i guess if a ghost was riding a zamboni helping the NHL gain some popularity everything would be alright for our Canadian friend). How many men out there have their biggest relationship bonds with their father over sporting events, I sure remember the first time my Dad took me to the ballpark, and I also remember the last game we saw weeks before he passed away. People may think baseball is a boring sport and thats OK but a baseball game is a different expieriance than attending most sports, there is more down time and thats where a lot of bonds are formed, hearing about players from a past generation, before the big $$$, and that is why this film can relive some great memories for many. Instead of asking why, realize what this film is, it is a fantasy movie about what many of us would want, I would do the same to have one more chance to feel 12 again and have one more game of catch with my Dad.",Field of Dreams

257,Alyssa-the-Critic,Haunting. Uplifting. Somber. Film needs more like this....,10,15 February 2018,"The emotional core of this film is driven by the haunting and simple piano, synth and panpipe score of James Horner, by the sincerity of Costner as Ray Kinsella, and the startling clarity of the story Alden Robinson crafts onto screen -- A man that himself has no inkling of belief in the likes of ""the voice"", of ghosts or the supernatural. Which you wouldn't know it to watch this film that has you believing, has you alongside Ray and his supportive wife trusting the magic, and ultimately renders itself timeless only 19 years later.Featuring great supporting performances by Amy Madigan, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones and the late Burt Lancaster as 'Doc ""Moonlight"" Graham '. Quite simply Phil Alden Robinson's best picture to date, and perhaps any to come!We follow Ray Kinsella (Costner) as he takes a leap of faith in the aftermath of a series of existential crisis of his own imagination, to first build a baseball diamond on his rich farmland. But the journey only begins there... To this we are taken on a road trip down memory lane (metaphorically and physically) in his search for answers. Why did the voice choose him?This call to action builds and eventually culminates in one of the most emotional and crushingly heartbreaking pay-offs in movie history. Sons and fathers. Fathers and sons. That is the underpinning of what this movie is really about. Family. Regret. Passing (death) and the path to redemption all set against America's greatest passtime; Baseball.Laced full of quaint and funny moments, Field of Dreams (1989) is two parts drama, one part comedy and a helping of adventure to connect it all. Look for a stellar performance by James Earl Jones and in particular a speech that should have your hairs standing on end, whether you like the sport or not!",Field of Dreams
258,mtraininjax,A movie about believing in something,10,29 August 2006,"Sure parts of it seem far fetched-Fenway Park screen that only 2 people out of thousands see, but that is about faith. Notice how Shoeless Joe only shows up when Maggie tells Ray they don't have enough money for the farm. At that point, the movie is all about faith in what you believe, and do it! Ray could have sold the farm, he was at the 11th hour and he had to sell and he believed in the players. Faith came to play when only Ray and his family could see the players on the field. Faith came to play out when Mark threw Karen off the bleachers and at that time did Mark see the players.Its not a movie of good or evil, its about faith in believing in something, your dreams, your convictions, and following through when the world wants to shut you out. Never give up!",Field of Dreams
259,mamta-thakur-26,A Magical movie!!,8,29 June 2016,"I must admit, I was a bit skeptical about watching this movie. I didn't expect much but since it's been on my list for a very long time, finally I sat down to watch it. And what a magical experience it was!I was completely absorbed in the story throughout the movie. The most outstanding qualities of the story are the honesty and innocence with which it's told. The actors are magnificent and the dialogues are memorable. The lines are sometimes cheeky but they are delivered with such honesty that one can't help but believe them :)It's like a fairy tale for adults, with messages like ""Follow your dreams"", ""Believe in yourself"" and the first and most important message about loving your family. It just clicks with you. The actors sometimes do what we all want to do with our lives. They follow their hearts and stand with each other against the whole world. One of the most beautiful movies ever made!It will stay with you longer than you imagined.",Field of Dreams
260,acro47,Favorite movie of all time -- and definitely not a baseball movie!,10,3 June 2005,"I watched this movie with some reluctance the first time. Being a 50-something woman, the last thing I wanted to see was a baseball movie.I never got the ""baseball thing""... I always thought of it as THE most boring sport next to golf. But then, I didn't have a dad or brother or boyfriend who played.The first time I watched ""Field of Dreams"", though, several years ago, I was spellbound. From the beginning of the movies, I hung on to every word. By the time the movie was half over, I knew I did not want it to end.Later, as I thought about it, finding I couldn't get the movie out of my head, I wondered why it had so captivated me... and I decided I would have to see it a second time to figure out the answer. A few weeks later, I watched it again. I was absolutely just as enchanted the second time.Kevin Costner is not a favorite actor of mine. I personally don't think he has much talent, and to me, he seems to play every role almost exactly the same. Yet, Costner was definitely a great choice to play the role of Ray Kinsella, disillusioned as he struggles not to become his father and discovering that his father had dreams too. James Earl Jones absolutely IS Terence Mann, the 60s pacifist/rebel -- I can't think of another actor who could have played that role so believably. And Burt Lancaster as Doctor Archibald Graham, again perfect casting.So why have I watched it 20 times (and will repeat the experience for the rest of my life)? How can a person watch a movie over and over again and not get hopelessly bored? As a matter of fact, it's like any life experience which is so pleasurable or so much fun that you want to repeat the experience. Why do people ride a roller coaster a second, third, fifth, tenth time? Why does a person choose chocolate every time he gets an ice cream cone? Why do we have sex again and again throughout our lives? The answers to all these questions is the same: because it was enjoyable and we want to experience those feelings again.My number one hobby for relaxation/enjoyment is reading. My kids grew up always seeing their mom with a book in her hand. I love historical fiction above all other categories, but I also read hungrily books about politics, religion and philosophy, biographies (which I also love), and well-plotted fiction. I am enthralled when I have that rare and special experience of opening a book for the first time and, in just the first few pages, realizing I have uncovered a treasure. I love that experience of realizing halfway through that you must slow down your reading pace because you don't want this incredible experience to end. I can easily read a book a second, third, or fourth time for the same reason: it's a wonderful, thoroughly pleasurable experience which, at some point down the road, I will want to repeat.""Field of Dreams"" is one of those movies you either ""get"" or ""don't get"". If you get it, you get it from the very beginning. If you don't get it, you can watch all the way to the end and it won't mean a thing. Read through these 20 pages of reviews and you'll see who gets it and who doesn't.""Field of Dreams"" is immensely watchable, again and again, for the very same reason. It gives you hope. It makes you smile. It encourages you to dream.Thank you!",Field of Dreams

James Earl Jones' baseball dissertation in front of the bleachers is terrific. Outstanding film in every way - my all time favorite.

It was a wonderful film then and it is a wonderful film now. However most of us know this already so I am not going to delve into that.What I'm doing here today is to complain. After watching Field of Dreams I immediately - out of reflex - wanted to log into the IMDb forums and talk to fellow moviegoers about the film.But I could not.I have been active on IMDb since 1997 (Con Air and The Saint). I have made a lot of comments in almost 20 years on the forums. I have made a lot of friends, a few enemies, and even some enemies who became friends. It is amazing how film and music really breaks barriers so people who might disagree on everything else can find some common ground in film and music.I have not really used IMDb since the forums closed, I doubt many have. I may hop in to see how an actor is up to or when a film may be in the works but the heart of IMDb has been shut down and wrenched out. What good is having a film site but not allowing people to honestly (or even dishonestly but that is what IGNORE is for) talk about the films?Thanks for the 20 years of chatting with my fellow movie fans at least.However the only reason I logged in today was to say: You guys at IMDb really mucked this site up.",Field of Dreams

I cannot even remember for certain now what the other film was, all I remember was the impact Field of Dreams had on me. I have watched it now more times than I can remember, but still am moved every time. The cast are all perfect in their roles, and James Horner's musical score is pure magic.

I only hope that the Academy of Motion Pictures kicks itself for not giving this film the Oscar for best picture.  I mean, sure, Driving Miss Daisy is a great film, but is it better than Field of Dreams? I have loved this film for as long as I can remember, but it is just recently that I felt so strongly about it.  My grandfather recently passed away and he was a big movie buff as well as a former minor league ballplayer and a lover of the game..  We saw a few films together at the theater before he died but it was this film that helped me get through his death.  The strange thing is that he did not like this movie as much as I did, but it didn't matter.  It made me remember all of the times that we were together and how much I loved him. I chose to watch this film before I read a Eulogy poem about baseball which I wrote for his funeral.  It made me cry, as it always does, (It holds the honor for the only film that ever has) and I got through it perfectly. You see, it is more than a movie.

It's uplifting.  It's not corny, it's beautiful.  It's not only American, it's baseball.  As the line in the movie states, ""Baseball has been a constant throughout our time.""  And that is true with a lot of American fathers and sons too.  No matter the arguements over the grades, the cars, or family matters, American boys have always made time to forget all that and have a ""catch"" with dad.

For someone who understands what the game of baseball truly stands for and what it means to play catch with your father and have that be a religious experience, Field of Dreams is much more than a ""feel good"" movie.  Phil Alden Robinson's adapted screenplay is hands down the best ever written, and it connected with me in a way that no other movie has.  There is something in the eyes of the actors, and something in the camera, as if you can feel Robinson vicariously, that tells the audience that they are watching a film that has the opportunity to change their lives.  I have never found another movie that has made me feel this way.  This movie can be fun, and can be so deep if the viewer will let it. I am sure that most people do not view this film in the same manner as I, but there can not be anyone who would see this film and not enjoy it, even on the surface level.  I don't know why I'm leaving this summary, I just seemed compelled.  I love movies, and I have an extensive collection of my ""favorites"" but, Field of Dreams is and always will be the only film that gives me a complete feeling of wholeness.

A man who was obviously at odds with his father, and not wishing to become like him, goes ahead to build the impossible. Time passes and inexplicably ""shoeless"" Joe Jackson appears, they talk, play catch and eventually the rest of the Chicago White Sox - banned for throwing the 1919 world series, and later nicknamed the Black Sox - appear ghostlike from the cornfield. However, the voices don't stop there. Facing bankruptcy, and strain on his marriage, he goes on a search and meets along the way a 60's activist Terence Mann (James Earl Jones) and the mysterious Archie ""Moonlight"" Graham (Lancaster) and slowly the pieces come together. A film not just about baseball by any means, but set against the backdrop of the game. A truly wonderful, magical film of hope, dreams and having a second chance to put right the wrongs of the past. Brilliant cameo by Lancaster, just pure cinema. I can empathise with this film because I lost my dad.

Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) is asked by a mysterious ""voice"" to ""build it"" and ""he will come"". Kinsella is a confused and somewhat normal farmer with a somewhat normal life in Iowa. Until ""he"" comes. ""He"" changes everything and Kinsella seeks out the answer to ""why"" and finds a lost and apparently somewhat disturbed author (James Earl Jones). This is a sports movie with with unbelievable passion. It will have you hooked from the first second. Your heart will feel warm and it might even bring tears to your eyes.",Field of Dreams

280,lonjonsi,Baseball's Fanasty,10,16 May 2006,"This is a story of many men, who looking back may have given the thought of being a baseball player-when younger. Some of us have had some thoughts of ""just maybe I could have played pro ball."" This includes me as time went by and I did not try it as a youngster. I had the honor to visit ""The Fields of Dreams"" about 15 years ago and it was a very emotional moment to see the field and walk on the ground where some of my favorites actors had walked during the filming. As an after thought; I should have played on the field but there was too many people waiting to do the same. This is a movie which you can watch many times and will not get tired of it.

I've heard it said that this is a blokes film, but can I just point out that girls can get it too, especially those who, like Ray,have had problems with their dads. Prozac has it's place, but Field of Dreams,Kevin Costner(and yes he's not the greatest actor but in this he's perfectly cast),and the rest of the cast including the cheesy,sweetie child are a wonderful pick you up to get you going again.

Ray Liotta also does a great job, although I wouldn't recommend seeing this right after seeing ""Something Wild"", as Liotta does a fantastic job in that movie playing a vicious, ruthless guy.

285,doncurrie,"Lighting, Color, and Dialog Tie in Theme",10,16 September 2020,"The movie Field of Dreams is directed by Phil Alden Robinson, starring Kevin Costner (Ray Kinsella), James Earl Jones (Terence Mann), and Ray Liotta (Shoeless Joe Jackson). It begins with Ray, a novice farmer hearing voices while tending to his corn field. ""If you build it, he will come"" is the voice he hears. Not knowing what that meant, he kept pondering on this phrase until he had visions of a baseball field, replacing some acres of corn, and profit. Ray builds the field and as the seasons pass, he is discouraged that no one has come. His daughter first sees Shoeless Joe Jackson out in the field, awaiting out fielding practice. In a sigh of relief and disbelief, Ray humors Shoeless Joe and invites other players as there are 8 others.The Chicago Black Socks were accused of throwing the 1919 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds and all the players were permanently banned from professional baseball. This field is that second chance the players have to enjoy the game of baseball again. Thinking that his journey is complete, Ray hears another voice saying, ""Ease his pain"". Ray gathers that he must make another journey to find Terence Mann, a well-respected member of the social movement of that era. Terence's hidden secret is that he always longed to play at Ebbets Field, but before he was afforded the chance to try to make a team, the field was torn down. Terence and Ray journey back to the field we learn about a young man Archie ""Moonlight"" Graham that only ever got to play the field, and never made a professional at-bat before he was sent back to the minor leagues despite having an impressive batting average. Archie hung up his cleats and became a doctor as baseball just wasn't in his cards.Ray brings Mann and Graham back to Iowa where the baseball field is located. Mann and Ray watch as the ballplayers as two full teams are geared to play. Ray's brother-in-law cannot see the ghostly match between the players on the field and highly suggests that Ray should sell the field. Him and his family refuses because they see the majesty of what is happening in the ballfield. Ray's daughter chokes on a hotdog and while she is lifeless, the ballplayers stand and watch as Archie, whom only batted a sacrifice fly in the game before, exits the field, crosses the first base line, and morphs into his older self, a doctor and an old man. He knows that once he crosses the line from fancy to reality that there is no return. Archie rescues the girl and is gently celebrated by his fellow players as he exits the field, back into the corn.This is the turning point where Ray's brother in law witnesses what unfolds and discovers that the players were on the field all along, and now insists that they need to not sell the farm or destroy the field. As the players leave, Ray begs to go with them, as they have invited Terence Mann. His dream of playing at Ebbets Field never came true, but Shoeless Joe Jackson sees the pain in Terence's eyes as Joe invites him for a game out in the unknown, beyond the corn. The players all dematerialize into the corn, and Joe directs Ray towards the catcher's plate. As the catcher unmasks, he realizes that it is his father John Kinsella. The field wasn't only for the players that were banned from baseball, but this Field of Dreams allowed Ray and John enjoy one last conversation and maybe not the last game of catch.
The theme of this movie is about achieving lost dreams while celebrating the unchanged which is baseball. I can compare the theme of this movie to the movie The Blindside, about a young man who became a football player even through his struggles. The Blindside is a story about Michael Lewis, a young man failing school, poor, and no family to support his dreams at home. He is adopted by a family and is set on a path of discipline and hard work to achieve his goal. This mirrors Ray Kinsella in the Field of Dreams because Ray couldn't have built the field or found Mann or Graham without the support of his family and push from Shoeless Joe Jackson.Lighting and color played a big part in this movie particularly between the setting of the baseball field in Iowa, and the cities Ray is traveling in search of Mann and Graham. While Ray was journeying around the country, the scenes aren't as sharp or bright as back in Iowa. Each scene away from the field it seems like Ray is traveling through areas that aren't captivating and go by as a blur of travel. Ray meets Mr. Mann, a writer and secluded shut in, in his messy apartment. The lighting highlighted how messy his apartment was because the director most likely wanted to show how secluded and alone Mr. Mann was. Back at the baseball field, the lighting and color is very vibrant and bright. The baseball players wear faded, white, oversized, uniforms that stood out in front of the sharp green lines of the cornfield's backdrop. When the players were in the field, we knew it and the color choices aided greatly in keeping our focus on the players. When the field was empty, the brown of the clay and solid white stripes of the field perfectly stood out but fit perfectly within the plowed area of corn. When the lighting of the scene was vivid and bright, just as it was at the baseball field, it makes us feel as we are witnessing Ray's dream come true and all the doubters be put at bay.The director's style of acting and dialog also aided in pushing the theme of the movie. Most dialog in this film are one on one with Ray as he embarks on his journey with the support of his family. Ray Kinsella is very excited and fidgety when meeting his idols such as Mann and Joe Jackson. Ray almost stumbles over his words many times throughout the film. I believe this aids in showing how majestic and unbelievable this journey has grown to. The last scene where Ray and John are chatting one on one, Ray barely says anything that he is thinking. A few simple phrases are exchanged about the possibility of this field being ""heaven"". Ray looks at his family and all that he has and responds, ""I guess this is heaven"". Through his awe, he almost misses the chance to acknowledge that John is his father but ends up asking his dad for a round of catch. Ray's dialog with each character is very intimate and almost always one-on-one dialog. This technique ties into the theme because we get to see how each character specifically helps Ray through his journey, while reciprocating an unbelievable journey of the same. Everyone Ray comes in contact with has one thing in common, baseball. It is unchanged, consistent, and has been a part of our country's history for many years. Families connect over baseball and hoping to keep their farm, the Kinsella's are anticipating a lot of other families to come and connect just as Ray connected to his past.",Field of Dreams

287,jimmyc1955,Baseball as a path to redemption,9,25 March 2010,"At the end of this movie when Ray says ""Oh my God -its my Father"" - I sob, which my wife and kids think is funny.Why - why ever time I watch this film do I continue to have that same, overwhelming response to a film? In a word - redemption.My father died on Jan 1- 2000 - alone in a hospital room. I left him there when the doctor told me he was stable and would be fine. I went to a millennium new years party. At 3 AM the doctor called and told me my father died - alone. I would give ANYTHING to ask to be forgiven for that horrible, selfish act. Ray is given a chance to make peace with his past, and be forgiven. To discover that the love a father transcends time, and death. Ray's mystical quest to reach a grail he didn't know he needed reaches a moment of redemption that washes over me like a wave. When Ray Liota turns and says ""No Ray - it was you"" I cry - shamelessly. If the definition of art is to create a dense emotional cathartic response from it's viewers - this is the finest art I have ever experienced. The soundtrack is an integral part of the movie creating that ethereal mood that highlights key scenes. This is Kevin Costner's best movie, with the possible exception of Dances with Wolves. James Earl Jones sells Terry Mann with ease and conviction, and I like Amy Madigan in this film. In every life there are moments that we regret (for those who claim you don't - then either you haven't lived hard enough - or your lying to yourselves.) For some of us they continue to haunt us in the dark of night - relentlessly. This film says if you have faith, do the right thing, even though you don't always understand why that redemption lies before us. Isn't that why we all sob at the end?",Field of Dreams

In a time of increasing complexity, it captures what I long for and what baseball represents and what differentiates it from any other professional sport. The feeling of timelessness, of simpler times. That Babe Ruth could bat against Roger Clemons and still shine. The scene at the school board meeting is classic.

290,anythingyouwant,"""Hey rookie... you were good.""",10,26 January 2007,"Pure magic.This film, steeped in film legend, is by far one of the best movies Hollywood has ever produced. From the opening line, ""If you build it, he will come."" to the ending line, ""Hey dad... do you want to have a catch?"" give me chills every time I watch this movie. Ray Kinsella is played by Kevin Costner (who does a fantastic job I might add), and Terence Mann is played by James Earl Jones; the man could talk about taxes and I would give him 5 stars. Apart from being the greatest baseball movie ever made, this film is profoundly original, riddling one with questions such as: ""Where do I go when I die?"" and ""Do miracles really happen?"" It adds elements into it to make the film boundless without the watcher knowing it. I can relate this film to Back to the Future; it transports you to another time where everything is a coincidence, and nothing is impossible. However, nothing in this movie comes close to Burt Lancaster's performance as Archie ""Moonlight"" Graham. Every line the man gives is profoundly emotional and acted to perfection. I need to choke back tears even more so now, because I have seen the movie a couple times and know what is coming. Dr. Graham gives up his dream to save Kinsella's girl Karen; never able to come back after he steps off of the baseball field. Ray's line, ""Oh my God, you can't go back."" just brings a smile to the old man's face as he says, ""It's all right, it's all right."" Perfect. The only word I can use to describe this film. For although some say it has its flaws, historical, factual, or whatever, I believe that this movie more than makes up for them by dragging one into it's world and not letting go. I will give everyone this advice, go home and watch this movie. It doesn't matter if you have seen it before (that may even make it better) go rent it or buy it please.

294,melissadawnpayne,Loved this movie,9,1 November 2009,"""The Field of Dreams"", was a movie based on a corn farmer, Ray Kinselle (Kevin Costner), who after hearing voices builds a baseball field in his corn field to see if someone would come. Sure enough the Chicago Black Sox team showed up. This movie showed how if we truly believe and follow our hearts, dreams do come true. Ray follows the instructions of the voices and get in contact with Terence Mann, (James Earl Jones), who would become part of the wonderful world of dreams. Ray also gets in contact with Archibald ""Moonlight"" Graham, (Burt Lancaster), and he is allowed to relive his baseball dream only to be forced to choose between the game he so loves, or his calling as a doctor. The players live out their dreams but not only are they allowed to but so is Ray, Graham, and Mann. Ray gave to the players and in return he was given so much more in return. He was given a chance to see his father and the chance to share the dream with the rest of the world. This movie is truly a film that shows how the love for the game and the love for each other can live on forever. Just like the movie ""A Walk to Remember"" 2002, death does not mean that our love dies or that our dreams don't go on forever. Our dreams and hopes can be reached if we just believe. Ray went against the norm and made and took a chance building a dream even when everyone else said he needed to concentrate on his corn field. His dream paid off in the end and he received so much more than financial gain, he received hope. This is truly a great family movie that gives all that watch it hope in our dreams and the encouragement to live those dreams.",Field of Dreams

296,adrianewillis29,A man going with his heart...,8,6 August 2010,"Field of Dreams (1989) A farmer in Iowa searches for his purpose in life, until one day his purpose comes to him. Kevin Costner who plays Ray Kinsella hears a voice while standing in his corn field. Ray hears someone telling him ""If you build it, he will come"". Ray was standing in the field alone and looked at this voice as being his leader in finding his purpose. Ray takes this voice as direction that he needs to build a baseball field in his corn field. When Ray goes to tell his wife Annie (Amy Madigan) what he heard, she seems confused but tells him to follow his dreams. The theme here is to follow your dreams. Ray was searching for his purpose in life and really was not excited about too much. When he was standing in the corn field and heard the random voice, he knew that he must do what they said. Ray took the voice as telling him he needs to build a baseball field. He would do just that. Rays father, who recently passed away, had a passion for baseball. With Rays father John Kinsella (Dwier Brown) gone, he thought that his love for the Chicago White Sox was one of the reasons why he was hearing the voice. Ray started knocking down the corn stocks to build the field. He worked very hard on this; many locals would drive by in disbelief and uncertainty on what he was doing with the field. People often would laugh at him for his passionate actions. Ray gets very discouraged quickly and finds himself looking for another option. With everyone thinking he is crazy, his brother in law tells him he must give up and put the baseball field back to a regular corn field. With Ray being very discouraged, he happens to see several baseball players from the 1919 World Series team playing on the field. Ray then hears the strange voice again. This forces him to contact Terrance (James Earl Jones), who wrote a book about baseball. Ray then goes to Minnesota to meet up with him. The two men talk about baseball and the voices he heard. They both then return to Iowa. On the way back to the field, they pick up a hitchhiker who is a young man who says his name is Archie Graham (Frank Whaley) that wants to be a professional baseball player. They all three go to the field, and the young man goes to play baseball, when Ray realizes that other plays are playing on the field while he was gone. Ray then begins to argue with his brother in law about returning the field to a corn field. Rays Daughter Karin falls and is not breathing. When everyone goes to help, Young Moonlight rushes over to help Karin. He gets her to cough up the piece of hot dog. Ray then realizes that Moonlight cannot go back to his baseball days and shows a lot of apologies. Moonlight then goes back on the field and starts walking to the corn in the outfield with the other plays. Terrance then gets asked to go with them, which makes Ray very angry. They explain to him that he must stay behind to take care of his family. The lighting and angle of the camera bring a dramatic feel to this scene. Ray then hears the voice again, when his attentions is drawn to the catcher. When the catcher takes his mask off, he realizes that it's his father. Annie then insists on Ray introducing John to his granddaughter Karin. John then turns around to go to the outfield with the rest of the plays. Ray then asks John to play catch with him. Ray then calls John Dad and two become very emotional.",Field of Dreams

So when the scene near the end of the movie came where Ray finds out the catcher is his father, I just lost it. I never did see that curve ball coming.

I.E. if he was born in 1952 and went to Berkely that would have been no earlier than 1969 more likely 1970 so it wasn't the sixties. He married in 1974. His little girl was no more than 6 or 7 or so. He didn't buy the farm until he was 36 that would have made it 1988. The movie is one of the best baseball movies of all time. Both Amy Madigan and Kevin Costner were terrific. James Earl Jones as usual is great. I think that because there were no black ball players in the movie should not in any way detract from the film.

305,tedmichael,Field of dreams review with theme,8,21 June 2015,"In Field of Dreams, Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) begins to hear voices telling him to ""Build it, they will come"". Ray, at first, has no idea what this could mean. He consults his wife, Annie Kinsella (Amy Madigan), to try and gain an idea as to what it means. After she laughs and tells him he is going crazy. Ray begins to believe that he must build a baseball diamond in his corn field on his property in Iowa. As Amy begins to believe Ray, Ray embarks on a journey to get Terence Mann (James Earl Jones) and ""set him free"". Throughout the journey the audience follows Ray as he constructs a baseball field, befriends strangers, and creates magic that must be seen to be believed.Throughout the movie, there is a main theme that becomes prevalent, this theme is that one must always pursue their dreams or ambitions, no matter what people may say or believe against it. Even though Ray is told many times over, by Annie, Terrance, and others that his dream and idea is impossible and foolish, Ray still follows his heart to create what must be made. Annie is the first one to tell Ray that his vision is crazy. But, after an eerie dream with relevance to this vision, Annie believes in Ray and begins to support his cause. The next to try and stop Ray is Terrance. Terrance is not easily swayed by Ray. When they first meet, Terrance is scared and taken back by this irrational vision a stranger presents to him. But, after Ray takes Terrance to a baseball came, and they both see a vision on a screen, Terrance becomes swayed and believes in the vision of Ray Kinsella. Another movie that is similar to Field of Dreams, sharing a similar theme, is Mulan. Even though Mulan is in another category of movie, they share a similar theme. Mulan wants to fight, even though she is a woman, and women are not allowed in the army. Mulan changes her appearance to seem like a man and fights in the army, even though it is against believe. This theme, to pursue one's passion regardless of adversity, is shared between both films.Along with the storyline, there are other features in the movie that promote the theme of Field of Dreams. The first, is the angle. Throughout the movie, when Ray is hearing these voices, the camera begins to focus solely on him, and slowly spin around, showing the importance of this moment, and the cycling of thoughts through Ray's mind. Another technique that is used is the lighting. The lighting in certain scenes focus on Ray, as he drives towards his goal. When he is working in the field on the baseball diamond, even though it may be dark, there is a light on Ray to show his determination. Ultimately, Field of Dreams portrays Ray Kinsella's path and focus in a superb way and engulfs the audience in a terrific journey of surprise and compassion.",Field of Dreams

The feeling of having ""peaked"" in life, but not fully content up to that point- but with just enough time left to do something about it.This movie is a great reminder that sometimes life will throw you a second chance, and there still is enough magic left in the world for really special things to happen. If you are a good person with an open mind, an open heart, and a cornfield.Lastly, even the most macho and rugged guys on the planet will get a little choked up by the end of this movie. For me, this (along with the Toy Story 3 ending) always gets to me without fail. I hope you watch it and enjoy as I have over the years!",Field of Dreams
308,jacobmayans,Field of Dreams Review,6,4 December 2015,"It is safe to say that this is not a typical sports film. While this movie talks about baseball, it also speaks to the American people in a way that brings out that joy and happiness we all strive for; That dream that speaks to the American conscious. For Ray (Kevin Costner), an average farmer in Iowa, who never knew that he was really searching for something until he heard the disembodied voices from this cornfield begin to tell him to build a field, of course the magical field that starts a chain reaction to everything that takes place in the movie. Rays long journey ahead is similar to the game of baseball, that is it takes both teamwork and individual skill. ""If you build it, he will come"", a phrase that keeps ringing in his ears has also rung in the ears of pop culture. A whisper that keeps stirring his thought and gets him to believe he needs to do something with his life. Some say he was absolutely insane, other questioned his mental state, but what Ray goes on to do becomes one of the greatest decisions in his life. Building a baseball field on his farm made a statement that he didn't want to be like his father. His father never made one spontaneous decisions, an aspect of his father that Ray never wanted to have. With that being said, the American dream slowly grows in Rays mind as he dreams big and reaches for the stars. His love for baseball is magnified and his heart is full as he lives these life changing experiences.",Field of Dreams
309,49ers4ever,Best Baseball Movie Ever,10,5 July 2006,"In my opinion, this is the best baseball movie ever created; possibly even the best sports movie ever created. It's got everything; great acting, historic and nostalgic baseball, and just a great story overall. Kevin Costner is the perfect part for movies like this, as he was in Bull Durham and For Love of the Game. If you've ever played or loved baseball, this movie will bring back warm, sentimental memories of those simple times in your life that involved a simple game of catch, or those baseball heroes and villains that you grew up reading about. James Earl Jones is on top of his game as a 60's activist writer, as well as Ray Liotta as the ornery Shoeless Joe Jackson. This is, quite simply, a must-see movie.",Field of Dreams
310,rdroerick,I just watched it again!,10,2 March 2007,"My father died 8 days before my wedding in 1988. My new husband and I went to the movie in the theater after it's release, I could not sit through it. I just finished watching it with my youngest daughter. I believe the movie is about regret, loss, and decisions. If I could have one wish it would be to fish with my dad. As a teen I had a busy life,he would beg me to go and I would refuse. When I became a young adult he had given up asking. Looking back, I did not realize then how precious time was. This movie always brings me to this feeling, emotion. No other movie projects this as intensely and beautifully. I love it and am so happy my children do, too.",Field of Dreams
311,jtwford,One of the great movies about our greatest game...,9,26 November 2005,"I have loved this movie since I saw it in the theaters when I was 11. As a die-hard White Sox fan, I sat down and watched this and 8 Men Out the week after the 05 WS ended. As good as both of these films are, they were always hard for me to watch, as the reminders of the 1919 Sox's indiscretions hit me very hard every time. This time though, a feeling of relief and redemption overwhelmed me. This time, the tears were not from frustration, but from sheer joy, knowing that generations of Sox fans, both alive and passed, have finally seen years of frustration washed away.One small bone to pick with this film. Ray Liotta, who's work I do enjoy, was quite possibly the worst pick they could have made for Shoeless Joe. A slow, simple, illiterate southerner was portrayed as an articulate speaker with a thick New Jersey/New York accent. This has never seemed quite right to me.Otherwise, this is one of the 5 greatest baseball movies ever made, along with (in no real order); Bull Durham, 8 Men Out, The Natural, and Cobb.",Field of Dreams
312,PeterD1361,"A Magical film, no matter what age or maturity level you are",10,3 May 2006,"It is hard for me even to write a review for this movie...I just don't know where to begin. I am 19 years old, and have seen many ""great"" films, but Field of Dreams is absolutely the best I have ever seen.This movie is much more than meets the eye. On the surface, it receives much criticism for being considered a ""cheesy,"" melo-dramaticized film with unbearably sappy lines. However, I am tired of hearing this repetitive criticism.Field of Dreams is the story of a farmer, Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner), a complete product of the 60's, who lives in Iowa with his wife, Annie (Amy Madigan), and daughter, Karin (Gaby Hoffmann). Moreover, it is the story of a young father who has lived a predictable, yet regretful, life.You see, Ray's father loved baseball. Especially during a time when baseball seemed like a golden sport sent from God, solidifying itself as ""America's National Pasttime,"" during the 1920's. This was when some of baseball's greatest, most legendary players were either in their prime, or beginning their careers. Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, Lefty Grove, and Shoeless Joe Jackson all played during this ""golden era"" of baseball. However, it was also during this time that the ""Black Sox"" Scandal occurred, and put a black mark on baseball in many fans' hearts. When Ray says some of the harshest words possible to the most true baseball lover he knows, his dad,(for which I will not tell, since it would spoil part of the movie), he ran away to college and completely shut out his father from his life.Living a plain life full of solidarity, Ray one day randomly hears a voice, or revelation, if you will, while working in his corn stalk. Following from this, Ray spends the next weeks and months on both a physical and mental journey, fitting pieces together and following different cues, kind of like a detective solving a mysterious crime.What transpires from all this, without spoiling the movie, is one of the most memorable, miraculous, and heart-warming moments ever reproduced on film. But I guess you'll just have to see it to find out.This movie can be related to on many levels. For the standard movie critic, you might argue that it is an over-fictionalized, sappy movie...you know what, to be fair you might be right, on some level. But I would argue that this film could not have been done as successfully without that component to it, and certainly would not have achieved the same emotional, desired result. But the same way as Disneyworld is magical to a young child, Field of Dreams is magical to a moviegoer. You don't have to love baseball, or even like it for that matter, but you do have to appreciate the father-son relationship/aspect of the film that transpires throughout the entire movie, and the magical (even if somewhat melodramatic) ""cloud"" under which the entire story takes place.For any person, man or woman, who has ever thrown a baseball and had a game of catch with their dad, this movie is the quintessential father/son, father/daughter emotional, movie-going experience. It is an instant classic, and it is because of movies like this one that we go see movies in the first place, and share our most intimate, fantasy-filled moments with our family members. It is truly a ""magical"" experience. Field of Dreams is one of those rare, well-made movies, where (to sound fitting to its criticism, sappy) dreams can come true.",Field of Dreams
