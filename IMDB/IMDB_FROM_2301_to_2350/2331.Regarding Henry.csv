0,SnoopyStyle,misguided J.J. Abrams story,5,23 June 2015,"Henry Turner (Harrison Ford) is a ruthless arrogant lawyer. His wife Sarah (Annette Bening) is more concerned about appearance. Their daughter Rachel suffers quietly as the family rots from the inside. Henry is shot during a convenience store robbery. It leaves him with severe brain injury. Physical therapist Bradley (Bill Nunn) tries to help him recover. Along the way, he discovers some dark things about his life and tries to fix his family.Henry is obviously annoying at the beginning. The most annoying part is when he starts berating the store robber. It's pushed too far. Then it tries to be a loving tribute to brain injuries. It's a fantastical fantasy where Henry's diminished capacity leads to redemption and salvation. That is also as annoying.More specifically, there are a couple of other problems. The guy is barely able to read and yet he figures out the one important piece of evidence in a stack of files. There is a way to save it if the daughter helps him and together they find the clue. The Ritz cracker is a horrible idea. Henry's injuries are way too severe for this movie to make sense. It's also way too cute wrapping everything up.I can excuse Mike Nichols because the acting is pretty good. He is most known for getting great actors to do good work. Indeed, Harrison Ford does good work. The writing from J. J. Abrams is horrendous. The story is completely misguided. There may be a way into the story by making the wife Sarah as the main character. The movie needs a giant rewrite.",Regarding Henry
1,jboothmillard,Regarding Henry,5,11 May 2017,"I had heard about this film for some time, mainly because of the leading actor and bits and pieces I had heard about the concept, I hoped it would be something I would enjoy, written by J.J. Abrams (Forever Young, Alias, Lost, Star Wars: The Force Awakens), directed by Mike Nichols (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, The Graduate, Closer, Charlie Wilson's War). Basically Henry Turner (Harrison Ford) is an ambitious and highly successful Manhattan lawyer, but he is obsessed with work and has a callous, narcissistic, and sometimes unethical nature. Henry being despicable and ruthless in the workplace, spending the majority of his time there leaves him little time to be with his prim socialite wife Sarah (Annette Bening) and troubled pre-teenage daughter Rachel (Mikki Allen). One night, Henry goes into a convenience store for cigarettes, there he interrupts a robbery, the Gunman (John Leguizamo) shoots Henry in the chest and head before fleeing. The bullet to the head hit Henry's right frontal lobe, and the bullet to the chest hit Henry's left subclavian vein, this means he experienced internal bleeding and a cardiac arrest, but more imminently he has suffered brain damage, losing the ability to move or speak, and suffers retrograde amnesia. With the help of a physical therapist Bradley (Bill Nunn), Henry slowly regains his movement and speech, returning home he is almost childlike, with Rachel teaching him to read, being impressed by his surroundings, and forming new friendships with his family and colleagues. Henry realises he does not like the person he was before the shooting, and she and her daughter have become much closer, she is not happy to be going to an out-of-town elite school for girls, as had been planned for her, Henry and Sarah also become much closer, returning to how passionate they felt when they first met, she suggests they should relocate to a smaller, less expensive residence. Henry is allowed to return to work at his firm, but his old assignments and large office are taken away, he is essentially only assigned busy work, he begins to realise he does not want to be a lawyer anymore, this is confirmed when he hears ""friends"" making derogatory comments about him at a dinner. Henry finds a letter to Sarah from a former colleague disclosing an affair, he is also approached by fellow attorney Linda (Rebecca Miller) who reveals that they also had an affair and had told her he would leave Sarah for her, this makes Henry have second thoughts about himself and his relationships. Henry gives documents from his last case that were suppressed by the firm to the plaintiff who was right all along, he apologises to them, in the end Henry resigns from the firm, says goodbye to Linda, returns to and reconciles with Sarah, realising everything with their lives, before the shooting, was wrong, and finally they withdraw Rachel from the school, Henry and her family all walk away happy. Also starring Donald Moffat as Charlie Cameron, James Rebhorn as Dr. Sultan, Aida Linares as Rosella, Elizabeth Wilson as Henry's secretary Jessica, Robin Bartlett as Phyllis, Bruce Altman as Henry's partner Bruce and John MacKay as George. Ford is often in roles showing not much emotion, so it is perhaps an odd choice for him to be a mean lawyer turning nice, Bening gets some good moments as his wife, it is a very simple story, it may have its flaws in terms of star power, some sympathy for the characters and some predictable bits, but can just get washed up in the glossiness of it, it is a nice enough story, a reasonable drama. Worth watching!",Regarding Henry
2,ccthemovieman-1,Could Have Been Super With One Major Adjustment,8,3 May 2007,"One problem I had with this movie was too-high of an expectation. A good friend said it was one of his ""all-time favorite films"" so I was expecting something super. This was good, but not of that caliber.The story was a good one: a ruthless lawyer gets shot and brain-injured and is forced to re- start his life. In the process, he becomes a good-hearted, nice man. This would be an excellent ""family film"" except for needless profanity and usage of the Lord's name in vain. Much of the language comes out of the mouth of the therapist. It's too bad they didn't tone the language down so more people could have enjoyed this good-message film.Warning: the film drags in spots, too. However, the good acting (Harrison Ford and Annette Bening provide attractive, solid lead performances) and the good story make this a good film overall. I wouldn't mind seeing this again.",Regarding Henry
3,moonspinner55,Artificial piece with a screwy message...,3,10 December 2006,"One of those high-budget, yet relentlessly schlocky movie-star vehicles which both pander and condescend to a mass audience; the pedigree talent involved may well warrant a viewing, yet the film is so pompous it makes viewers feel like chumps for watching. Harrison Ford plays a slimy, self-absorbed lawyer whose life takes a drastic turn after he walks into a liquor store being robbed. Annette Bening plays Ford's spouse who helps her husband through a difficult period, and has a rebirth of her own. This is precisely the type of material director Mike Nichols would have thumbed his nose at twenty years ago; working here rather joylessly, Nichols wraps all the phony uplift in cinematic Saran Wrap. The self-deceit (and smugness) hanging over the film is like a gray pallor. *1/2 from ****",Regarding Henry
4,blanche-2,Harrison Ford makes the film,7,5 June 2014,"Harrison Ford is such a popular, warm, and likable actor, he can't help but elevate any film in which he appears. Of course, a few weren't worth elevating, like Sabrina, Six Days, Seven Nights, What Lies Beneath) but every prolific actor has a few clinkers. And no matter what, he's always good.Here he plays Henry, a real legal shark, the stereotypical type, who is shot when he goes into a store to buy cigarettes. He is shot in his frontal lobe, which means he has lost his memory, which includes how to talk, walk, tie his shoes, and remember his wife Sarah (Annette Bening) and daughter (Mikki Allen). It's a long, slow road, but he connects with his therapist, Bradley (Bill Nunn), so much so that when it's time to go home, Henry doesn't want to leave.We see Henry after his rehab but before he is completely well. In cases like this, while a great deal of his memory may never return, he probably will become a little sharper as time goes on. Here, he speaks slowly without much affect and though he can take in what he reads, it's obvious he won't return to the law. He's changed and realizes that he doesn't like the old self reflected to him in the law firm and in the shallow people who were supposedly his friends. The people around him - the housekeeper, his wife, and even his daughter - like this Henry a lot better. But he learns the past was more complicated than the present.Let's face it, without Ford, this could have been a movie of the week. With Ford, it's a feel-good story, if predictable. He's wonderful, as is Annette Bening who struggles to get used to the new Henry. They are surrounded by some strong TV and film people.I admit I have a soft spot in my heart for Ford after transcribing an interview with him while he was making an Indiana Jones film. He and the interviewer were in a coffee shop in some out of the way place, and a man approached them and talked to him. He walked away, and them he came back and asked if Ford signs autographs. ""Let me ask you something,"" Ford says, ""when you go to the movies, do you pay for a ticket?"" ""Yes,"" the man says. ""Then I sign autographs,"" Ford answers. He's a class act - all the way.",Regarding Henry
5,Quinoa1984,a un-involving melodrama with one performance that fascinates up to a point,5,13 April 2006,"It's a little odd to see a film like 'Temple of Doom' one day, and then seeing Regarding Henry quite soon after. Harrison Ford is not usually an actor thought of for his range, but more for his star presence in films, of the swaggering, sarcastic, and all-around bad-ass of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, the Fugitive, and Air Force One, someone who can even in his later years open a movie in theaters fairly well. When he ventures out to really give a full performance and expand his talents, it can be hit or miss. Regarding Henry displays his skills of going past his usual star persona, while showing that there isn't much to reach for in some of these riskier roles. Because the film, directed by Mike Nichols and written by JJ Abrams, is lackluster in the ways that matter, of giving as good as it could promise on its premise, and with at least a few contrivances.Henry, a successful lawyer, gets changed completely when two bullets wipe out his motor reflexes and the majority of his memory. Coming back from scratch to his wife (Annette Benning), daughter, and friends and colleagues, proves to be a slow but revealing task as Henry becomes a more enjoyable and open kind of person, in his way. It's not without some interest in these early scenes, like the first half an hour of the film, where the bulk of this transformation takes place. His rehabilitation early on hints at what will come- the innocence of Henry, childlike at first, and then with more on the mind as the past comes back to him, for better and worse. Ford accomplishes this performance with subtlety he's not known for, but at the same time he also has to play to a certain type, which then starts to limit him. It's hard not to watch him on screen, as good as he can be in what he does, but in subverting himself with this script it grows wearier as the story goes into more predictable territory.Another problem, and considering this is Mike (The Graduate, Carnal Knowledge) Nichols, there isn't enough dramatic conflict to really get involved with the characters, and some performances seem less dimensional than should be (Henry's rehab guy, the daughter with her same dour face). The borderline of this being a grown-up story of an after school special gets on the line, and then crosses to and fro, that it becomes frustrating. It's ironic though to say I would recommend watching the film just once, as it does have enough to it to watch once, for Ford and Benning's work. That it's a disappointment though of what could've been is undeniable for me. Still, if you want to see Ford doing something non-kicking ass and taking names, start here.",Regarding Henry
6,utgard14,Puttin' On the Ritz,5,18 June 2014,"Ruthless lawyer Harrison Ford is shot in the head by John Leguizamo during a convenience store robbery. He survives but suffers brain damage. He loses his memory, including forgetting how to speak and walk. He slowly recovers and learns to function normally but his wife and daughter are surprised at the changes in him -- namely that he now seems like a nice guy. We know he's nice because he no longer slicks back his hair like he did before. Only greaseballs slick back their hair. He's also semi-retarded now and movies have told us time and again that being retarded means you are inherently good and easy to get along with. The premise is certainly interesting but this is pretty clichéd and even cheesy. Ford's performance is sure to elicit laughter from all but the most sensitive types out there. Bill Nunn is the highlight as Ford's horndog physical therapist (""I gotta get me some of that""). Brought to you by Ritz Crackers.",Regarding Henry
7,grantss,"Good, but not great",6,1 September 2016,"A lawyer, Henry Turner (played by Harrison Ford), is shot but survives. However, his speech, mobility and memory are impaired and he now has to reacquire these skills. Moreover, he has to relearn his life.Good, but not great. Had tons of potential but pulls its punches and falls back on clichés. Plot is a bit choppy and uneven too - too many blind alleys, when the writer and director should be concentrating on more profound statements. I would have expected much better from director Mike Nichols and writer JJ Abrams. Still, fairly moving and interesting.Great performance by Harrison Ford in the lead role. Good support from Annette Bening.",Regarding Henry
8,Calicodreamin,Heartwarming,9,21 July 2019,"One of my all time favorite movies. Regarding Henry is an absolutely wonderful movie. The storyline is so well thought out and the acting is amazing from both Ford and Bening. The characters drawn you in and make you feel such compassion, both for Sarah and Henry; what would you do if you had to deal with the rehabilitation of your loved one? What would you do if you had to start from scratch? What if you woke up in your life and didn't like who you were?",Regarding Henry
9,view_and_review,Recreating Henry,8,12 April 2020,"""Regarding Henry"" is a tender movie about change. Many movies have been about a person changing for the better. Usually, the change is brought about by an extreme, maybe even life-threatening event. In Henry's case it was memory loss brought about by a bullet.Henry Turner (Harrison Ford) was a successful lawyer--so I guess by definition he was bad. He was pushy, driven, and demanding of everyone--his family and his underlings. When he was shot in the head and chest during a liquor store robbery he lost his ability to speak, his motor functions, and his memory. He would regain his speech and his motor functions while he never fully regained his memory, which meant he lost that which made him him. He would have to create new memories with his friends, family, and colleagues and recreate himself. The new Henry became a joy for his family and a disappointment for his law firm.""Regarding Henry"" is a drama with enough drama to make it a movie and not too much drama to make it a soap opera. Movies like this are always touching, but they're also binary. Without explicitly saying it these movies leave you with two choices: be a success or be a family man. Be wealthy or be a good person. It's like wealth and success can only be achieved by being a type-A personality which makes the person unbearable. Should the person not be as driven, focused, or demanding then they will also not be successful, but they will be well liked. I like the ""Regarding Henry"" movies out there even if I don't think success and likeability have to be mutually exclusive.",Regarding Henry
10,Aaron1375,I thought Harrison Ford did a fine role in a man who becomes literally someone else.,8,11 March 2010,"This film is about a guy who is a bit of a prick, he does not seem to get along all that well with his wife and he is not exactly all that warm and cuddly to his daughter. He goes out one night to buy some cigarettes and ends up in the middle of a hold up and ends up getting shot in the head and I think shoulder. He ends up with brain damage and must now learn how to do simple things all over again. He gets some help from a very charismatic health care worker who helps him walk and talk once again. Henry (the name of Harrison Ford's character) is a bit hesitant in going home and living with a wife and daughter he has very little recollection in, however, he does so and they are in for a treat as Henry is now seemingly a more loving and caring person than he was before. Nice story, not all drama as there is quite a lot of humor in this one too. I like it when he somehow finds his way into an adult movie theater. He also has troubles adjusting back to his old job where he was a rather ruthless attorney, as he keeps finding things that he left out that could have helped the other side. I enjoyed the story and I enjoyed the transformation of old Henry to new Henry. He learns about the old him throughout the movie and he finds he does not really care for who he was either. A nice trip of self-discovery.",Regarding Henry
11,namashi_1,Harrison Ford delivers a sincere performance...,6,17 April 2011,"Harrison Ford delivers a sincere performance in 'Regarding Henry'. Directed by cult filmmaker, Mike Nichols, this drama, offers some interesting moments, but they come up only in the second hour.'Regarding Henry' tells the story of Henry Turner, a New York City lawyer, who struggles to regain his memory and recover his speech and mobility after he survives a shooting.J. J. Abrams's Writing in the first hour is deary, and doesn't hold. However, the writing gets better in the second hour, and offers some interesting moments, that includes a satisfactory culmination. Mike Nichols directs this Human-Drama nicely, but the writing is not up-to the mark, especially in the first hour. Cinematography & Editing are alright.Performance-Wise: As told, Harrison Ford delivers a sincere performance. In fact, this performance is amongst his better works. Annette Bening does a good job as the spouse. Mikki Allen is convincing as the daughter. In supporting roles, Bill Nunn stands out with a likable performance.On the whole, A film that had tremendous potential, but due to a weak first hour, it's impact goes a miss, despite having a convincing second hour. However, A must for Harrison Ford fanatics.",Regarding Henry
12,=G=,A fabricated feel good audience pleaser.,6,3 August 2002,"""Regarding Henry"" is a too-good-to-be-true feel good flick in which Ford plays a NYC hardball trial lawyer who suffers brain damage resulting in amnesia and then sets about to reclaim his memory, his identity, and his family. The film is obviously fabricated to be likeable and is, pushes all the right buttons, and offers some poignant moments and reminders of what is important in life. Nunn's character is delightful, Benning's is flat but works, the daughter shines, and the puppy is too cute. Overall ""...Henry"" works more as a crowd pleaser than a critic's darling. Good, light hearted dramatic fun for sentimentalists. (B-)",Regarding Henry
13,sddavis63,Second Chances,7,14 May 2008,"In a change of pace from his usual ""action"" type movies, Harrison Ford does a pretty good job here as Henry Turner - a high powered, selfish, self-absorbed, heartless, cold as ice (enough adjectives?) lawyer whose life revolves around work and who ignores both his wife and his young daughter for most of the time. Henry's life undergoes a major change as the result of a shooting, which resulted in massive brain damage. Coming out of his coma, Henry can't talk or walk and has no memory of anything or anyone. He really does start from scratch; a child in a man's body. Much of the movie is then taken up with watching Henry struggle to recover from his trauma.OK - it's pretty predictable. Point given. (Having said that, I thought the movie might take an unexpected direction when Henry discovered the letters in his wife's dresser.) Predictable though it may be, however, it was still pretty well done I thought, and offers several tug at your heartstring sort of moments that are pretty good. Annette Bening was believable as Henry's wife Sarah, and I thought Mikki Allen did a pretty good job of capturing the essence of their young daughter Rachel - her fear, her confusion. It came across. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Bill Nunn as Bradley, Henry's physiotherapist who helps him to rebuild a life that's very different from what he had, but is also far more fulfilling.Ford, I thought, was better as the ""new"" Henry Turner - recovering from his trauma and turning into a new man. As the cold Henry at the beginning of the movie, he came across to me as almost too cold - a caricature of the heartless lawyer but not quite a believable character. That aside, I found this to be an enjoyable and interesting movie to watch, and the last scene at the school really did touch me. It's certainly not good enough to attain the level of a classic, but it is pretty good. 7/10",Regarding Henry
14,Robert_duder,Ford Vehicle strikes a chord,8,8 February 2006,"Mike Nichols is without a doubt one of the most influential and famous directors of all time. Having previously created The Graduate, Catch-22 and later directing Closer, The Birdcage, Primary Colors and Angels in America...he's no stranger to film making. He's done everything from intense drama to comedy and drama/comedy Regarding Henry is no exception. Granted I think it's one of Nichols' lighter films, nonetheless it has something very touching and watchable about it. It's not perfect, it's flawed and I think one of the flaws is that superstar Harrison Ford doesn't necessarily put all he could into his performance and that pains me because Ford is without a doubt one of my top favorite actors. I don't mean to say he doesn't do a great job...he just could have done more with it.Harrison Ford plays Henry Turner who, along with J.J. Abrams' script and Mike Nichols direction, very clearly present a man who is selfish, conceited, top of his league defense attorney with very little scruples. His family life is suffering but he is barely noticing. They perfectly establish the old Henry Turner and his less than desirable personality in 15 minutes, so that we get a true feeling of his revolutionary change. Henry's world comes crashing down when a random convenience store robbery ends up with him being shot twice...once in the head. For a such a powerful man on screen to go to this quiet, nearly crippled, intellectually stunted man is a brilliant performance. He makes the new Henry Turner so beautiful and loving and you feel this connection to him just like everyone else does. He learns so much about himself and gets the opportunity to start over from scratch. He has to learn everything again from social interaction to reading, to being with his wife. Annette Bening plays Ford's wife Sarah Turner. Although I've never been a big fan of Bening, she's been in a lot of great films and she does a good playing self involved wife who learns so much from her husband's new found life. Ford and Bening have terrific chemistry and you want to see them as a family. Both do a stellar job. Mikki Allen in her one and only big screen role is really good as the daughter of Henry, Rachel. She helps her Dad and gets her Dad back as they work through the problems together. They find a whole new relationship. The supporting cast are all very well done and do exactly what they are meant to do...support. With some truly touching moments Ford performs wonderfully if not a little subtle for his own good.Regarding Henry is the perfect date movie, everyone will love it, you might laugh, cry, but either way you'll just feel this connection to this man. Ford definitely is the star as he always is and this low key performance is probably one of his best. Absolutely check this classic one out!! 8.5/10",Regarding Henry
15,ElMaruecan82,Talk about a wasted opportunity ...,6,23 December 2013,"For all the virile toughness Harrison Ford showcased during his career, one director, Mike Nichols, believed in giving him a shot as a totally different kind of character, a man struck by amnesia, reborn as a sweet and caring husband and father, so delightfully contrasting with the arrogant yuppie bastard, conveniently a lawyer, he used to be. That could have been an Oscar-worthy performance for Harrison Ford, or a poignant humble drama about a family stricken by a tragic accident, but the outcome is so cheap, so predictable that it's not surprising the film has sunk into oblivion just as quickly and surely as Henry Turner's memory vanished.And the first blame is on the screenplay, there's nothing written by J.J. Abrams, a fitting name for a script that flirted so much with parody, that doesn't seem forced as a necessary set-up for an emotionally rewarding pay-off. The film opens with a man who's obviously a suave bastard, so confident over his own ego that he dominates anyone around him, from his colleagues to his secretary, from his wife Sarah (Annette Bening) to his daughter Rachel (Mikki Allen), lectured like an incompetent associate just because she dropped lemonade on Henry's beloved piano. You know when someone behaves so condescendingly and let's say patronizing toward a child that a scene where he's the Father-of-the-Year will come up. And naturally, in another badly made scene where you can tell the girl is waiting to 'accidentally' spill her glass of orange juice, so he can do the same thing to reassure her, that now he's changed.The problem is that that very scene, which supposedly show Henry's transformation, highlight the film's biggest problem which is Ford's portrayal of a simple-minded man. The man is shot with a bullet to his head when buying cigarettes in his usual grocery store (why the robber aimed at the head we'll never know) and after a comatose episode, he remembers nothing, not even how to speak, let alone to read  but don't worry, the recovery will be so spectacular for plot's sake that we won't have time to worry much. The miraculous cure is driven by Bill Nunn as Bradley, a charismatic and jovial care taker who'll make Henry finally speak by putting too much tobacco on his eggs. At that time, we never know whether Henry is an adult who just lost memory or a child in an adult's body. Anyone would believe a man dropping juice on the table as a joke, has something of a child, but had the plot stick to that characteristic, there would be no plot.Then we get to the last case he worked on, where he obviously hid precious information allowing his client, a wealthy and respectable Hospital institution to win the case, naturally, as a new man, Henry will side with the 'David' against the greedy and high-powered 'Goliath'. But how can a man so childish be able to understand the malevolent schemes he elaborated, did he get the innocence of a young child and hence understood it was just 'bad'? How about his colleagues, couldn't they see the man changed for the worst according to their own standards? ""Regarding Henry"" looks like an assemblage of micro-plots and subplots whose conclusions only depends on Henry's level of intelligence, which vary according to the purpose it serves. And if Ford genuinely keeps the right one-note performance as if he understood that Henry's behavior couldn't change, the writing is never on the same wavelength.It's a real shame, because the performances are all decent, Annette Bening is good as the devoted wife who discovers the new face of her husband, Mikki Allen, has a normal look that conveys an inner sadness, in her portrayal of a lost preteen. Bill Nunn steals the show, I especially liked their last conversation about the meaning of their life, and the idea of second chance (the film needed more moments like that). I also liked some plot points regarding sex and money, real-life marital issues, but Nichols was in a hurry to get to Henry's redemption and to incarnate it through a real good deed, when he give the incriminating evidence to the couple he'd just ruined their life, the rest elements of the story hardly mattered at that moment, and it was time to end the story. Nichols made so many solid and poignant stories and ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" reduces ""Regarding Henry"" to the level of a TV Thursday afternoon drama.There might be another problem ""Regarding Henry"" which simply is due to the very premise of the film: since Henry changed as soon as he recovered from that injury, he was a good man from a beginning, and de facto, he couldn't be nothing else, the character didn't evolve, he didn't owe his goodness to a change of mind, but to a strike of fate. Noentheless, there were many opportunities to make the story more endearing: his previous mistress, the adultery, the relationship with his daughter, something that make us wonder what could happen next. There's nothing in the film any film lover wouldn't see coming from a mile, should that ruin the enjoyment, not so? But there has been so much great films released since that it's incomprehensible how the collision of such talents could give such a mediocre result. Talk about an unfortunate accident, mostly to be blamed on the writer and the director who couldn't see through it, and the actors who could at least try to spice up a little bit. Give Ford a great screenplay, and he'll make you a real Oscar-worthy performance (this comes from someone who just saw ""Witness"" again) ""Regarding Henry"" is victim of that common syndrome from wannabe great dramas, you don't see what they are, but what they try to be. I'm not sure ""Regarding Henry"" intended to be so flat, but it did.",Regarding Henry
16,inkblot11,A scummy lawyer gets shot in the head and becomes the nicest guy in the world.....what a great concept!,8,19 May 2007,"Henry (Harrison Ford) is a terrific but dastardly lawyer. Defending a hospital for negligence against a poverty-stricken diabetic, Henry wins! Its not the first time the little folks have gotten the shaft from Henry. He lives in a posh New York City apartment with his beautiful wife (Annette Bening) and sweet daughter. Yet, things are strained on the home front between the couple and money goes through their hands like water. However, one evening when Henry slips out to buy cigarettes at the shop around the corner, he is caught in a holdup and ends up getting shot. There is considerable brain damage and the doctors can not tell Henry's wife just what his future holds. Thus begins a lengthy rehabilitation for the once-brilliant lawyer that includes learning to speak and write all over again. He makes great strides with the help of a very caring therapist. Most importantly, Henry changes from a person with a very dark demeanor to one who is almost innocent in his view of the world. Still, many secrets remain, mostly from Henry's past life at the law firm. Can Henry and his wife overcome their problems and stay together? This is a very nice movie with plenty of heartwarming scenes. Ford has never been better than he is here, for his role runs the gamut from despicable lawyer to a disabled man struggling to speak and relearn basic skills. Bening is also great as the wife who finds a way to fall in love with her husband all over again. The rest of the cast is also quite nice, especially the gentleman who plays Henry's therapist. Then, too, the sets, costumes, direction and production are very worthy. Still, the movie's themes are the most important aspects of the film, as the film questions the integrity of the law profession and also ponders whether the best part of a person is his heart or his brain. Regarding all of the films, sitting on the shelves of a video store, this one is something special. Don't delay in garnering a view for you and your partner soon.",Regarding Henry

20,zkonedog,Watch For The Terrific Acting & Touching Story,7,5 March 2017,"""Regarding Henry"" is a simple movie. It doesn't contain any explosions, tense/scary moments, or blockbuster action scenes. In fact, one might say that the movie doesn't really have any ""action"" at all. What it does contain, however, is healthy doses of terrific acting and great storytelling, which make it an entertaining experience from beginning to end.For a basic plot summary, ""Regarding Henry"" tells the story of Henry Turner (Harrison Ford), a suave, cocky lawyer who doesn't have much time for wife Sarah (Annette Bening) or daughter Rachel (Mikki Allen). After being shot in a drugstore mugging, however, Henry is forced to essentially re-learn life again via physical and mental therapy. The person that emerges turns out to be quite different from the ""original"" Henry.If you need one concrete reason to watch this movie, the acting from Ford would be it! His facial expressions and gestures perfectly fit this movie and are much-needed in a film experience that rely so much on the ""little things"".The main storyline of the film--written by rookie screenwriter Jeffrey Abrams...now known the world-over as ""J.J.""!--is also nuanced enough to never get old despite its relatively slow pace. The story of a man have a re-learn everything about his life is intriguing enough (and in this case just humorous enough as well) to really hold your interest and make you care about what is going on.Overall, ""Regarding Henry"" is a solid cinematic effort that does a lot of things right. It takes a great human-interest story and gives it some terrific acting depth.",Regarding Henry
21,leplatypus,This isn't Harrison who is crippled but the script (rental),4,11 December 2014,"The movie is rather well directed, well scored, well played with a special mention for the daughter and the trainer but the story is just unrealistic. I know it has been written by mister Abrams (who does a cameo) but the story he wants us to believe has nothing to do with the real life. As too many Hollywood desk writers, the characters have no connection with the audience. Here, it's not the courageous cop or the brave doctor but the well-known brilliant and successful lawyer! We should tell those writers that there are thousand jobs outside to pick to tell a story! With such a dumb choice, the emotion is clearly washed up as Harrison gets the best doctor, the best clinic, the best house, the best school for the daughter, the best hotel and so on His rebuilding as a new man is a good idea but considering the starting point, I really don't care after. About Harrison, he is always this formidable soft-spoken guy who is right and doesn't let go! But as I don't like to watch him play a bad guy, I don't like more to see him suffer.

23,jzappa,The Epitome of the American Feel-Good Film,8,30 March 2007,"Regarding Henry is about a man who projects a cold, emotional shell and seems as if he cares nothing for anyone but himself, full of malice that seems like simple inconsideration, a self-centered cockiness, and an extreme difficulty with allowing mutual understanding amongst those close to him, especially his uneasy wife and unhappy daughter. When he is shot incidentally in a robbery, because his emotional shell drops for no one, not even an armed thug in a convenience store, he recovers over the course of a few months, with serious brain injury, reverting him to an almost childlike state, thus a primal, basic form of himself, and a truly sensitive, caring person emerges, completely naive to the value system of his former self. His barefaced heart wrenched by all the decisions and actions he made leading up to the incident, he intends to fix them.This is a wonderful premise and even more truthful and honest about the human condition that one may think, but to be honest, it is plagued by an almost unbearable lightness. A story this emotionally stimulating needs weight, further development, a script untouched by formula, and all these needs were fulfilled, the film would be yet even more fulfilling and the moral of the film would be less obvious and more provoking of insight and thought. I think it's a good movie, and tears will be shed, but in its requirements that had to be reached for fear of mainstream rejection or misunderstanding, not enough tears were should and it is left in a condition where its full potential is not reached.Just as Mike Nichols, in the midpoint of his career around this film's time of release, began giving his films less atmosphere, less edge, less intensity (which would later return with films like Primary Colors and Closer), Harrison Ford's performances are normally quite stilted, even if he tends to be in very enjoyable movies, many of them classics. In Regarding Henry, he delivers one of his very finest, really feeling his character deeply and expressing emotion very realistically and compassionately.",Regarding Henry

Not only is Henry despicable, ruthless, dishonest and corrupt in his profession (this makes for an ideal lawyer, I hear), but he also operates in the same mean and rotten way towards his family and friends, too.One fine day, Henry, in his usual mode of miserable arrogance, inadvertently steps into the midst of a robbery that's taking place at some scuzzy, run-down Mini-Mart. (Like, what's Henry doing in this area of town, anyways?) Henry is promptly shot ""bulls-eye"" (right smack dab) in the exact goddamn middle of the forehead by some two-bit crook with the precision aim of a real marksman.Unfortunately, this bullet to the brain doesn't kill Henry. Instead, after a miraculous recovery (in record time, no less) Henry is transformed, like an angel, into Mr. Sugar-And-Spice-And-Everything-Nice.This character turn-about has got to be one of the phoniest and most sickening change-of-heart scenarios that I've ever witnessed.

But his attitude changes after a gunshot wound completely erases both his memory and his Type-A personality, allowing him a second childhood and a chance to learn how to stop and smell the roses. The film maintains a surprisingly effective low-key mood for such a maudlin scenario, but there's a certain overkill to the understatement, and the screenplay doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of its characters or conflicts. The shallow TV neatness and too-convenient symmetry of the story (Henry's gunshot lobotomy transforms him, almost overnight, into the perfect family man) can be forgiven in light of the relative inexperience of 23-year old writer Jeffrey Abrams. But don't blame the script for the shameless product plugs, which suggest that Henry's rehabilitation would have been impossible without the help of Ritz Crackers. In the end the film is just another summer crowd-pleaser, no less fantastic, improbable, or superficial than any routine FX blockbuster.",Regarding Henry
26,jimbo-53-186511,Compelling drama with an excellent performance from Ford,9,31 January 2015,"This story focuses on hot shot lawyer Henry Turner (Harrison Ford) and the after effects on his life following a shooting which resulted in him suffering brain damage, loss of speech and loss of mobility.I suspect that there are some people who may find this concept hard to swallow and on the face of it the premise is a tough sell; Before the shooting, Turner is an arrogant, rude, and seemingly uncaring individual - a man who is more interested in his career than his family (which seems to be a cliché with most lawyers). Then when he awakes from his coma and regains his ability to speak he suddenly seems to be a completely different person. This, on the surface, may seem like a contrivance, but personally I was prepared to buy it. We learn that Turner's memory & brain have been severely affected by the shooting - it then appears that Turner has just awoken as a new person. I don't believe that to be the case, I believe that Turner sees life in a new light and I believe that Bradley was a major contributory factor in all of this - Turner sees people doing good deeds and being kind to one another. Although his memory loss will have meant that he forgot about who he used to be, I still believe that his rehabilitation was the biggest contributory factor in improving him as a person. It probably also helps that he's away from a lot of his sleazy lawyer friends - there's no-one around to corrupt him.Ford's performance is another big factor in making the film work and his transition from arrogant slimy lawyer to mild mannered & gentle family man was just effortless. Likewise, the supporting cast were also excellent - it was also a bonus that Turner's daughter wasn't annoying as well.I think the most touching aspect of this film was Turner's relationship with his daughter (post shooting). He actually became more like a friend than a father. This is probably because his brain was probably at a similar stage of maturity to his daughters following his recovery. It was so nice to see him build a relationship with his family that probably never existed before.As well as being compelling as a drama the film also has many light hearted moments (many of the scenes between Bradley and Turner were absolute gems).I did have one or two very minor issues with this film; 1) I found it hard to believe that Turner's employers would allow him to return to work when he quite clearly wasn't ready to go back to work 2) It would have been nice to see the scumbag that shot him be brought to justice. Again, nothing major - just minor niggles more than anything.I really liked this film and thought it was a heart-warming, touching film that was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. It's not a film that warrants multiple viewings, but it's certainly something I'd watch again.",Regarding Henry

The movie is about a hardline attorney who gets shot after a brief introduction to the character and loses a lot of his brain function including his memory and tries to climb back into his old identity. Harrison Ford is fine in the starring role and the other actors are OK too, but the direction just isn't that great. Very little is done with music and the camera is just kind of there following the story except for a pan-in and pan-out at the beginning and end of the movie. Nichols is an acclaimed director but he just doesn't seem to do much with this story and the introduction of the characters before the accident isn't sufficient. Henry, the main character, eventually decides to make a new life of himself with the help of his rehabilitation coach(who provides the best character in the movie) but then the movie is over pretty much. He develops a nice relationship with his daughter who has to help him do simple things like read and tie his shoes after the accident. He also develops a family life which he didn't have before because he was an obsessed over-worker. There are some good lessons here, but everything is really flat emotionally -- which doesn't make for a worthwhile movie experience unfortunately.",Regarding Henry

32,natashabowiepinky,Regarding This Film.....,6,4 October 2013,"If this film teaches us anything its that we should all get brain injuries so we can be more thoughtful, happy people. Take Henry for instance: One minute he's a ruthless lawyer with no morals, alienated from his wife and daughter... Then, when he's shot and brain damaged in a hit-and-run newsagent raid, and after his (surprisingly quick) rehabilitation, he transforms into a far more pleasant, laid-back kinda guy. EVERYONE says they prefer the new him... apart from the nasty attorney snobs he used to call friends, and he quickly realises he can never return to his old ways. But, who cares? He seems more content than ever. In fact, I was so taken aback by his new found blissfulness after his devastating injuries, it got me thinking... Pass me that hammer will ya? *BONK*Well, that didn't work... It just meant I had to take two aspirin. YOU LIED TO ME, HAN SOLO!! Seriously though... if being on cloud nine means being reduced to a former shell of yourself, I'll pass thanks. And that's the problem here... Everything, from Henry's too-speedy recovery, to his discovered appreciation of what matters to him in life seems too calculated, too designed in the fabric of the movie. We're not really looking at a motion picture about a man recuperating after a massive head trauma, it's more about a yuppy finding out that life isn't about dinner parties and expensive furniture. A nice thought, but Frank Capra was doing this sort of thing 50 years ago with slightly more panache.Don't get me wrong, though. There's plenty to admire here, from Harrison Ford's affecting performance, the chemistry he has with a luminous Annette Bening and a script which efficiently involves us in the main character's plight from the get-go. It's just that everything is too simply dealt with considering how difficult the central premise should be, and the choice between being a depressed workaholic and a happy-go-lucky family man... Well, there's no choice at all, is there? In other words, a little more complexity and drama would have been nice. It's not bad. But it COULD have been something special... 6/10",Regarding Henry

35,roghache,Poignant tale of a workaholic who discovers his own humanity,9,6 May 2006,"This is a wonderful, warm hearted tale that portrays a jerk lawyer who, through seemingly unfortunate circumstances, must come to grips with his own humanity. It reveals the vulnerability of us all, when we see this hot shot attorney quickly changed to a confused patient, struggling even to sort out different coloured shapes. Though admittedly somewhat predictable, the film is extremely well acted and numerous important life truths are brought out. I think the movie is under rated here, and unfortunately less well known than it should be. The story revolves around a ruthless workaholic New York City lawyer named Henry, who is shot in the head and chest during a hold up at a local convenience store. As a result of his injuries, he loses mobility, speech, and significant memory. Henry's recovery is slow and difficult, though he has the love and support of his wife and their twelve year old daughter.Harrison Ford's acting prowess makes this movie. The uncertainty and fear in his eyes throughout much of the story is heart wrenching. Ford is absolutely compelling as the affluent, successful lawyer who must now learn to do everything from scratch...walk, speak, tie his shoes, read, even have sex. Ford is a great favourite of mine in all his roles, and he should have been at least nominated for an Oscar here. Annette Benning is also perfect as his wife, Sarah, struggling herself to cope with the husband to whom she is a virtual stranger. It's a very touching scene when the couple first have sex following his return home from the hospital. Also, the young actress (Mikki Allen) who portrays the pre teen daughter, Rachel, is charming in her role, and Bill Nunn is engaging as Henry's physiotherapist, Bradley, who plays such a major role in the early stages of his recovery. Now I'll address some of the criticisms laid by other reviewers. Yes, the references made by physiotherapist, Bradley, to female passers by are crude and sexist, though he is such a genuinely likable character and so kind to Henry (who grows absolutely dependent upon him) that I was easily able to overlook this and wasn't offended. True, the therapy program would undoubtedly have included reading skills, but they do make a touching scene of having Rachel teach her dad to read. Finally, I agree that in the end it should have been made clear as to how Henry plans to earn his living, I was waiting for some explanation. Personally, I didn't care for some of the profanity though otherwise, the flaws are minor compared with the movie's numerous strengths.The film brings to light an incredible number of truths about both social ills and personal human flaws. For example...the workaholic who ignores his child, the evils of the dishonesty in the law firm, the emphasis on the material and shallow (fancy homes and parties) by the couple's business and social circle, the competition and social status of Rachel's prestigious new boarding school, the betrayal of love and trust caused by extra-marital affairs, even the parental over reaction to a child spilling her drink on the furniture.This is a movie ripe with messages, but through such an engaging personal story that it doesn't seem preachy. I personally love the cocktail party scene where Henry is ignoring the shallow, status conscious guests discussing their plastic surgeries, instead chatting with the waiter who is passing around the hors d'oeuvres. By the end of the film, it has become quite obvious to the viewer that Henry didn't have it all BEFORE his injury; instead, he has it all AFTER.",Regarding Henry
36,disinterested_spectator,The Head and the Heart,5,31 January 2015,"Henry is a partner in a law firm. He is arrogant, ruthless, and demanding, as unpleasant at work as he is at home. Then he gets shot in the head during a holdup, and after a little therapy, becomes a really sweet, loving family man who realizes that when he was a lawyer he did things that were wrong.This is probably not very realistic. My guess would be that if brain damage caused a personality change, it would more likely be for the worse. But stranger things have happened, so I suppose the combination of a bullet in the head and lack of oxygen could destroy the part of the brain that makes a man a jerk. The question is, regardless of how likely or unlikely such an event may be, why pick this particular scenario to base a movie on?The head and the heart are the two major components of a man's personality, and the question that has occurred to people over the years is, which of the two is more important? Of course, it is not as though intelligence and a pleasant disposition are mutually exclusive, and that if you have one, you cannot have the other. There are doubtless many geniuses that are kind and loving, just as there are simpletons that are mean and cruel. But if you did have to choose, which of the two would you want more of?Movies often say that the heart is more important than the head. In ""A Chump at Oxford"" (1940), Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy find themselves at Oxford, where a bump on the head restores the intellect and character of the man Stan used to be, Lord Paddington, brilliant scholar and athlete. He is also arrogant and condescending, treating Ollie with contempt. Another bump on the head, however, turns Stan back into the good-natured simpleton that we are familiar with, much to Ollie's delight. A couple of other movies that champion the heart over the head are ""Harvey"" (1950) and ""Forest Gump"" (1994).On the other hand, if a man is a genius, a certain amount of unlikable personality traits will be tolerated. Sherlock Holmes, for instance, is often portrayed as austere and aloof. In ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (1965), Dorfmann (Hardy Kruger) does not suffer fools gladly, but we suffer him gladly because he is so brilliant. And the eponymous character in the television show ""House"" (2004-2012) is often shown to be rude and obnoxious, but all is forgiven because we thrill at watching a superior intellect at work. Furthermore, we vicariously enjoy the arrogance of these characters, since we ourselves often chafe at having to be so darn humble and polite.Needless to say, ""Regarding Henry"" comes down on the side of the heart. But as I said, I don't think it is very realistic. A more likely outcome would be that a man like Henry would still be the same obnoxious person he was before, only less able to express himself.This is not helped by the fact that the matter of their finances is never really addressed. Henry's daughter Rachel asks her mother Sarah if they are going to be poor, for which Sarah has no good answer. The advice she gets from a friend is not to tell anyone about the dire nature of their finances, but to go out with some friends and spend lots of money, as if keeping up appearances is the solution to Sarah's problems. Sarah does have a job, they do find a less expensive place to live, and they eventually pull Rachel out of the private school, although that is more for emotional reasons than financial ones. In short, we do not have enough specifics to draw any definite conclusions about their finances, but I would have expected more drastic cutbacks in expenditures than that. So, when Henry resigns from his law firm, the sense of financial doom still seems to be hanging over them.The point is that our credulity is already strained by the premise that an obnoxious man would be transformed by brain damage into a wonderful person. The additional unreality of their finances pushes our ability to suspend disbelief just a bit too far.",Regarding Henry

Stanley Swerdlow does a great job as a physical therapist.My only concern about the movie is that I wish Henry's wife, Sarah (played by Annette Bening) had somehow or in her own ways paralleled Henry's evolutionary change-of-heart during the recuperation process.This would have explained just why a person who married a high-power corporate attorney (and who had steeled her heart enough to send her only child away to a snooty boarding school against her wishes) was perfectly fine with staying married to a brain-damaged, partially disabled man.

Henry, a corrupt lawyer who withholds evidence when his client is obviously guilty and a womanizer is seriously injured in a robbery. When he comes to, he has lost his memory and has to be re-taught just about everything. His teacher is a very virtuous man, who teaches Henry to enjoy the good things in life (Henry loves most of all Ritz crackers). Thus the mean, cheating Henry who forced his daughter to remain at a boarding school that she hates, is suddenly transformed into a kind man who cares about everybody's feelings.

44,LuckyFour-LeafClover,My favorite Harrison Ford movie,10,6 December 2020,"I think when one thinks of Harrison Ford Star Wars or action films come to mind. This one was one the I guess rare dramas he did?Harrison plays a rather arrogant and unethical NYC attorney in this film. He's not the nicest to his family as well. One night he gets shot in the head. When he wakes up he becomes almost a childlike figure one in which his family starts to like him better. The rest of the movie revolves around Harrison's character adjusting to his new life.
This film hit home on a personal level because my Dad reminded me of this character. A very non touchy feely man. But then he went through issues that almost killed him but made him more warm and likable in the process.",Regarding Henry
45,Funky A,"Predictable formula, boring result.",5,17 August 2000,"Regarding Henry is not a movie, it's a formula. It is incredibly predictable. You know the ending at the beginning and it is not a pleasant ride. The screenplay is bad. The way the story unfolds in this movie is cheap, the dialogue feels artificial and the characters are cardboard stand-ups played by actors who don't believe for one second that they are the character they are playing. I usually really like Harrison Ford, as he knows how to be convincing in his role(although he tends to always get similar roles) but in this movie he gives a boring performance. Annette Bening is a great actress, but watch American Beauty once again instead of watching this, since she gives an awful performance in this movie. This is a two hour long soap opera... It is sad that this movie ends up being really lame, as it had an interesting subject. But what is really weird is that a good director and a good cast have made a bad movie... I guess anything can happen... 45%",Regarding Henry
46,August1991,Recommended Rental for Thoughtful Entertainment,6,25 June 2007,"Others here have provided a plot outline so I'll skip to three other points about this movie. First, this is one of Mike Nichols better efforts. For those who don't know, Nichols already has a substantial body of work. In my view, he's one of the best working directors in America today. If Oliver Stone can win the Oscar twice, then Nichols certainly deserves it again. True, Nichols usually works with good scripts, good actors, good craftspeople but then he puts the whole thing together well. Regarding Henry is an example.Second, I give license to scriptwriters because they must condense so much into two hours or so. In real life, the changes shown in Regarding Henry would have taken several years. To make the movie work, there's an overuse of magical turning points. In real life, such changes don't occur this way. Similarly, others here have portrayed the movie as an American morality tale: Bad Lawyer Goes Good. While the movie can be viewed on that level, it's also about how someone recovers from a horrific incident. In this, the movie is reaffirming like 'The Horse Whisperer'.Lastly, I'll reserve a comment for Bill Nunn who played Bradley, the therapist. (By the way, Bill Nunn also played in the Spidermans and even Canadian Bacon (!) but I don't remember him in any of those.) I did notice him in Regarding Henry because Nunn plays so well such a critical supporting role. Bradley the therapist was the first person to help Harrison Ford's character overcome his tragedy and bring him back into the ""real"" world. There's usually no money nor fame in being a therapist. But the script, to its credit, explains why Bradley is a therapist. The script also shows that life's worth ultimately is a personal value. Some people receive their income other than through money in their wallet.",Regarding Henry

Harrison Ford being my favorite actor was awesome in this role and it was one that separated him from the some times typical ruff character he often plays (so well I may add).This movie like Mosquito Coast gave Ford the opportunity expand his acting abilities and let people see of just how good of an actor he is.",Regarding Henry
48,Colonel Ted,Manipulative but quite enjoyable,6,10 February 2000,"Regarding Henry is the kind of shamelessly manipulative pap that really should have remained true to its `Disease of the Week' TV Movie roots. Harrison Ford plays a hotshot lawyer who has little time for his wife and daughter but has to start his life from scratch after being shot and brain damaged. And when I say from scratch, I mean as if he has just been born! He has to learn to identify colours, learn to walk, learn to speak and then rebuild his life and career. The plot employs every single cliché that you could thing of. There's a nice black physiotherapist, his daughter teaches him how to read again, his partners at work don't like him anymore and a few skeletons emerge from his and his wife's lives. But that won't matter because Henry realises that his life before he was shot wasn't so great. He cares for his family much more now and many of the big cases that he won previously, he did so by lying and cheating. And that was very, very wrong damnit!! By now you'll be thinking that I giving this film 1/10, but no. I'm actually giving it 6/10, because for all this calculating schmaltz, Regarding Henry is an entertaining and even compulsively watchable film. This mainly because of the star clout that is involved in it. Ford, away from his action man charisma is surprisingly convincing as the brain damaged Henry, Annette Bening is simply wonderful as his compassionate and sympathetic wife and Bill Nunn is great too as Bradley, Henry's physio. Director Nichols has made far better films both before and after this with The Graduate and Primary Colors, yet he handles the film well enough and Hans Zimmer has produced another great music score. You get the feeling from all the effort put into the film, that these people honestly thought that they were making heavy and profound. On that score they are seriously deluded. But all the same, Regarding Henry is quite an effective family drama and if you ignore how cheap it is, you could even have a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye.",Regarding Henry

Wrong.The main issue I have with this show is the believability factor. There is none. Why would a cold-blooded, mercenary law firm keep Henry on the payroll at all? He's obviously never going to be a mover and shaker again, as he once was. Why don't they just give him a nice severance package and move on? And how come Henry - who's been seriously brain-damaged - can figure out that his firm cheated on folks? Why would his wife keep old love letters from a long dead affair? Where did their money come from to keep on with their lavish lifestyle? And where was that money going to come from after Henry quit the law? And how did Henry recover so quickly - learning to read in a matter of a few minutes? It's all just a feel-good, chick-flick, fairytale for adults.I expected much more from such a talented cast and crew...",Regarding Henry
50,Rebochan,An underappreciated classic,10,26 June 2001,"First, I won't lie to you.  I love Harrison Ford.  That doesn't mean that I instantly love everything he does (*cough*SABRINA*cough*).  That said, this film really shows him off and also deals with a very real topic.Many people say this film is manipulative, but I don't see it, and I'm usually the first one to roll my eyes at something being overdone.  The characters were believable, though Harrison Ford easily outshines the others.  Playing someone with a disability is very, very difficult, yet he does it so flawlessly that you really believe that he is brain-damaged.The plot: Harrison Ford, as Henry Turner, is a cutt-throat lawyer who seems to have lost sight of life.  Yea, he's a total jerk, but this first segment is pretty crucial.  This movie has a habit of bringing back seemingly unimportant things (for example, Henry's opinion of the table).  However, one night after winning a case defending a hospital in a malpractice suit, Henry is off to buy cigarettes and winds up being shot by a panicked robber at the convenience store (The robber is played by John Leguizamo, by the way-probably jealous that Ford is a much better actor).  The bullets hit Henry in the head and he is brain-damaged.  Now, he must slowly start his life over again, trying to re-learn speech, tying shoes, and remembering who he used to be.  Of course, once he learns what an a**hole he used to be and the rotten people he was associated with, he is forced to make some choices about his life.There are some really great scenes in here.  In particular, the entire mystery of why Henry remembers the word ""Ritz"" actually plays a major role in the film.  Annette Bening is good as the wife who is trying to help her husband regain his own life and aquainting herself with the new Henry.  It cannot be stressed enough how stellar Ford's performance is.  Even if you hate the script, you'll have to admit that he is completely convincing as Henry.  This role is a real change for someone well-known for playing Han Solo and Indiana Jones.This movie is definetly worth a rental, if just for seeing Harrison Ford's Oscar-worthy acting job.",Regarding Henry

52,bobshankjr-2,Who doesn't like a dog?,10,6 October 2012,"Most of you have seen the film by now considering its age, so you know the conclusion from the complicated-and-warmly-evolving Aristotelian premises. But who'd expect a small, young waggely hound playing his dutiful roll (also via the protagonist's dog-bereft-and-emotionally-distant daughter, his wife Annette Bening, and a magic-man of remedial therapy played brilliantly by Bill Nunn), in this concentrated review of the shot-brain-recovery of a worldly-corrupted attorney, to help slowly regain his sense of priorities in life? And, to ultimately make apologies to his former and bereft clients? On an nsupervised 'outing', while he's still in recovery at home, former high-class lawyer, Henry Turner (Harrison Ford), finds himself at a New York pet-shop with a doggie-in-the-window ('how much' doesn't matter). Something 'cognitive' (a remote memory) suddenly occurs - and he brings the young hound home with assistance from searching friends and the hotel doorman at the 'Ritz'-Carlton' - where he lives but cannot remember the way home as a virtual 12 year-old. Healing now really begins. Although 'Buddy's' screen-time is limited by Mike Nichols the director, it's perfectly installed in several memorable moments - especially in the end where Buddy joins the family walking down the steps of Henry's rehab center after his release in a jumping, yelping 'I wanna be part of the family too!' kind-of-scene. I don't know about you, but I was fortunate enough to be part of a doggie's life every single day for 17 years, 9 months - right at the front door and every place else in my home and around town. I also needed healing - and my doggie? Well, she was the one. Right up to 11-22-11.",Regarding Henry

Ford and Benning and their daughter are all fantastic. Without being schmaltzy, cheesy, or Disney, there's a lot of soul transformation for the better throughout the movie. Many characters are role models. I feel I'll be a better husband and father, after seeing Henry's like roles in this film. My only criticism? Ford's supposed to be this terrible, cut-throat lawyer at the film's beginning, but I think Harrison Ford is just too nice to pull that off.

This film gives us a chance to meditate on what should be important in our lives. It shows an extremely accomplished man having to relearn what it means to be 'alive'. Because of this, the location for his rehabilitation is a very expensive home with high financial backing. I would like to see a similar movie set in a middle-class location, which would be more realistic to most of us, but I cannot think of one at the moment. Still, to remind us of the things that could be, the truth of what it means to be alive, makes for a supperb film which I believe may be watched by most of the entire family.

Henry doesn't bring down his former law firm and he doesn't recover fully (and you don't know that he will). However, it's a testament to Harrison Ford's normally under utilized ability as an actor. He essentially plays two roles (bad Henry at first and recuperating good Henry after the shooting). Seeing Henry discover his family and, in the process, give up his former life as a lawyer is heartening and done in a realistic manner. This movie shows us how easy it is to lose track of what is really important in our lives and should impress on the viewer that it should NOT take a bullet in the head to make us realize that. I think it's main problem is that it does not use anymore than a quiet kind of power to make its' points but that, I think, is part of the appeal of the film.",Regarding Henry

After I saw it, I was so disgusted. When something like this happens, the spouse and children have to adjust to a new life, and it isn't easy, and there's always a part of you that misses the kind of life you had envisioned. But in this awful movie, the wife is just pleased as punch that she gets to spend the rest of her life with a mentally challenged man, because he was kind of a jerk before he was shot, so you see, he and everybody else is better off because he was shot in the head and made retarded, the wife gets faithful husband, and the kids get the little brother they always wanted.They could have made an honest and interesting movie about what some families have to face.If the movie had been about what families really face in a situation like this, it might have worked.

It must, of course, be hard to play someone with physical disabilities (we can't expect everyone to do it as good as Leo di Caprio in ""What's eating Gilbert Grape"").

He's good at that. But this role is different. Some reviewers have suggested that the story treatment of the the character's  lawyer Henry Turner  recovery from a head gunshot wound is trivialized because the character (Turner) doesn't spend a lot of time bewailing the pain and inability to return immediately to his normal pastimes. These points  that he doesn't cry and curse his injury  are exactly what give the film its realism and impact. He doesn't know it as it happens, but he is experiencing a new birth through his recovery. Both my wife and I have to some extent  she to greater extent than I because her trauma was far worse  have gone through some sort recovery from brain injuries. If you spend a lot of time weeping and wailing (oh woe is me, is me, is me) you will never recover and will be tucked into the earth still weeping. Henry is injured and doesn't realize the extent of his hurts because he cannot know what went on before his traumatic memory loss. Does he change somehow? Sure, all life is change. Does he recover?

Also directing of Mike Nichols has a beautiful timing. Maybe Harrison Ford does not give his best performance ever, but at least for me it was something new and worth watching.  Obviously He has ups and down in this one, some parts are quite outstanding and some parts are not so believable.  Annette Bening is nothing special. She plays a role which anybody else could play as well.  And their daughter looks unnecessarily melancholic and cold. One of the best characters is Bradley (played by Bill Nunn), a black physiotherapist, which gives a new life to the movie whenever he appears.

After Ford's character gets shot twice during an armed robbery of an off-licence, he cannot walk, talk or remember his family. Ford plays this role with emotion, depth and believability.
The script rightly plays a bit on the difficulties and judgement of friends and family after this once top-shot lawyer has now become all but useless to the firm.
But the film as a whole feels rather shallow. Although it's supposed to be taking us through a character arch; a once dislikable man turns into a loving husband, father etc... it feels as though in real life, this would not be so easy or so quick to achieve.
It's rather clumsy, and fails to really pack any emotional punch. Which with a topic such a this, you wonder why it feels a little empty.
Yes it's rather a 'feel good' movie, with a redemption and a happy ending but with the cast on offer you feel it could have achieved more.

As a former speech therapist who worked with children and adults recovering from TBI I was appalled at the lack of apparent research in preparation for the film. Nichols and Ford were so far off the mark it was embarrassingly silly. Example: For person recovering language it's a bad idea to swamp them with so much language that all words become a meaningless string of sounds. It's the same as dropping a non-swimmer in the ocean knowing all that water is going to teach him to swim. The physical therapist was probably the worst and any self respecting speech therapist would've told him to be quiet. The plot is simple predictable and unmoving.why this director would take these actors and toss them into a dramatic ocean and expect them to swim without direction is as silly as their depiction of recovering from TBI.,Regarding Henry

The movie has a very simple, but meaningful message about what's really important in life. It's presented in a dramatic way with comical moments thrown in, just as life really plays out. Harrison Ford and Annette Bening are excellent as usual, but the real standouts for me were Bill Nunn and Mikki Allen. Bill Nun plays Bradley, an amazingly fun and enjoyable physical therapist. Mikki Allen plays the daughter, Rachel, in a performance way beyond her years that Was just unbelievable. I highly recommend this if you're looking to be inspired or just need a pick-me-up when you're down.",Regarding Henry
81,ekmungi,Very touching movie,10,29 August 2013,"As one other reviewer had said, this should have won an Oscar and I think it is highly underrated on IMDb. I have seen this movie a couple of times, but the last time I saw it, it had a different feel. I had just seen personally a family member undergo physiotherapy and also loss of memory... I could empathize with how Annette Bening felt and the performance of Harrison Ford was spot on. Some beautiful moments during the movie, like when he speaks his first words during recovery, when learning to read. The change in Henry's character is the major theme of the movie and how it affects the rest of the family has been well portrayed. The two contrasting worlds of Henry finally collide when he is forced to confront who he was. I felt the movie was a wonderful journey. More an under appreciated classic, I highly recommend it.",Regarding Henry
82,razzbeary,Corporate Workaholic Jerk gets Second Chance,10,24 June 2005,"I absolutely loved this movie! It really tugged at the heart. And dealt with issues of social status and what is really important in life. It helps us remember to take time out for what's important and not to give up when things look impossible. A good addition to your DVD collection! A movie my hubby and I BOTH liked. Even though I don't know if he would have liked it when we were a much younger couple. Very good acting, Bill Nunn was awesome in this movie as the physical therapist. And the little girl, played by Mikki Allen was very believable. A much better choice when nothing is on T.V. Pretty clean movie, only P.G.13 which is nice. A keeper!",Regarding Henry
83,Patton-14,Harrison Ford is allowed to show-off his talent.,8,1 February 2000,"Regarding Henry is the touching story of the redemption a big-money lawyer through a bullet to the head.  The story itself is quite touching and presents a good message to us all.  However, I feel the truely amazing aspect of the film is Harrison Ford.  He finally shows us what he can do as an actor.  He shows his talent by giving more to Henry's personality than just a heartless corporate lawyer.  By using his remarkable ability to feed off of other cast members, Harrison shows us a man who is trying his best not to let his inner soul, and his family, get in the way of business.  He is succesfull, but at a terrable cost to both him and his wife and daughter. When a convenience store robbery goes south, the gunman pannics and shoots Henry, who there to by cigarettes, in the head.  The resulting amnesia proves to by Henry's salvation, and Harrison Ford's shining moment.  Ford is very effective in his performence as someone who is having to relearn everything from to speeking, to tying his shoes.  In the end Henry rediscovers his family and his inner soul.  The writing for the film was decent, as well as the direction.  However, the movie becomes somthing more to the audience through Harrison Ford's remarkable performance.",Regarding Henry
84,tigrrbaby,Best of Show,9,14 December 2000,"Regarding Henry is Harrison Ford's crowning achievement. For once, he stepped out of his comfort zone (the typical action-hero) to play a character who is not supposed to be charismatic, heroic, or even exciting - and proved that he is, in fact, an excellent actor.Although I enjoy watching Ford on-screen, I find it easy to see HIM in each of the heroic action roles as I watch. In Regarding Henry, this was not the case.Ford convincingly portrays Henry through the stages of shock, rehab and recovery that accompany the shooting. As the movie progresses, viewers will forget that this is Jack Ryan and Indiana Jones. You will be intrigued as you get to know Henry and encouraged by the small steps he achieves in his recovery.In fact, Henry - an unpleasant fellow at first - gains his own kind of innocent charisma, a personal heroism in his persistence, and inspires anticipation and excitement as he develops and grows. He becomes, through Ford's acting, what the action heroes need special effects and stunt guys to achieve.Henry is something new, someone different. I give it a blue ribbon for Harrison Ford's ""Best of Show.""",Regarding Henry
85,HiFam-area,Touching,8,22 November 2002,"A very touching Movie. Harrison Ford is great as the ""Newborn Henry"", also good is Annette Bening as his troubled wife. A emotional gripping film, but nothing for the coldhearted and cynical. I give it 3 out of 4 Stars",Regarding Henry
86,anet12,An Overlooked Classic,9,20 June 2001,"The film Regarding Henry is an overlooked classic. A man finds himself learning all over again after a head wound.

It's a touching story that you'll remember.",Regarding Henry

This is true, so I will tell you now, if you hate those types of films then this is not the film for you.But if you miss seeing movies that you waited for the happy ending you knew was coming, then you will not be disappointed. There are so many movies that don't end so happily nowadays, but remembering the times with movies that had a character who had to learn a lesson but got something more in the end (eg. ""It's a Wonderful Life"") I couldn't help but enjoy this movie.I highly recommend it, the acting is fantastic, the story is touching, and knowing what it's like to go through hard times (my own dad had to go through some rehabilitation) then this movie hits it home. I suggest it if you agree with the points above, but it's not for everyone.",Regarding Henry
88,rick_yune,Lost masterpiece,9,10 February 2005,"People tend to criticise this movie for being 'sentimental'. Like all Like other classic films that have feel-good endings, such as It's a Wonderful Life and Shawshank Redemption, this film more than earns the right, piling on the pain in its first three quarters. Can you even say this film has a happy ending, since the subject matter it deals with (mental disability, adultery, greed versus the justice system) paints a picture of the world as mostly bad, but one in which people can become good. Harrison Ford, often called one-dimensional, has a real character arc here, from selfish lawyer to (seemingly) empty-headed to finally more sensible than the 'mentally abled' around him. This is a film about kinship with a good social awareness and almost the ultimate twist on the 'jesus works in mysterious ways' addage - He might make you get shot, and it'll be the best thing that could happen to you.",Regarding Henry
89,irritatedjulian,Disease of the Week TV movie with an expensive cast,4,25 March 2018,"In the 1980s, you were pretty much guaranteed that any film with Harrison Ford's name above the title would be really good. That began to change as the 1990s wore on and in hindsight, this is where the slide began.In theory this could have been an interesting movie. The redemption of a successful but unpleasant human being and the effect his behaviour had on the people around him. Yet somehow, despite the best efforts of everyone involved, it never becomes anything more than a made for TV disease of the week special. Albeit with an expensive cast. It's a real shame that the one time they paired up Harrison Ford and Annette Bening, it was in this!The cast themselves are fine and they all do their best with the material that they've been given. But crikey, the script is just so shallow and facile. It wasn't something I paid a lot of attention to when I first watched this as a teenager. But re-watching as an adult it's most unsatisfactory. Even though being married to evil Henry can't have been easy for his wife, the new Henry's a mixed blessing for her .Yes he's a much more pleasant human being than his old self but she's now left with a diminished, childlike husband for the rest of their days. Adjusting to that's not something that'll happen overnight. The film's also filled with contrived scenes. Henry's Ritz crackers, his miraculous learning how to read and the way he undoes the harm he'd done to the couple at the start of the film. It's all far too neat and tied up in a bundle for my liking. It begs more questions than it answers really.For what it is, it's well made. Ultimately though, it's the movie equivalent of a cheeseburger. It'll fill you at the time but leave you unsatisfied.",Regarding Henry
90,echuck,Pretty boring,4,25 August 2000,"Story was relatively boring. Directing was definitely boring. Some of the dialogue was a little too predictable.The one clever item was the deal with ""Ritz"" and trying to figure out for a moment how someone found Henry after he took off by himself.

Especially Harrison Ford deserves a big applause for his performance.",Regarding Henry
92,HisRAM2,"Touching, well acted drama about life's important things.",10,6 April 2001,"One of my favorite movies, Regarding Henry says volumes about what is important in life and where real happiness can be found. It does so without preaching--a rare commodity! Ford plays a man who has everything that most people value; power, respect, money and intelligence. But he is an arrogant and petty man who is willing to sacrifice his family for his own selfish ends. He loses all that he's been living for in an accidental encounter. In the end he is a good and decent man satisfied with the things he hadn't known were so important. Some of the scenes in this movie are predictable, some are a bit dated, but most are thought provoking and touching. A film for people who have a soul.",Regarding Henry
93,BubbleHelmet,Have you people ever SEEN a good movie before? 'Cause this isn't one of them.,2,28 November 2006,"Considering all the talent involved in the making of this movie (Mike Nichols, J.J. Abrams, the cast), one would have fairly high expectations of it.One would, however, be horribly let down.It's a hackneyed, shallow, almost insultingly lame movie. Harrison Ford's performance is just okay; I was particularly amused by the ""slicked-back hair = evil guy, floppy hair = nice guy"" idiocy perpetrated in the personal styling of his character. I kept wanting a story that felt real, relatable, or genuinely touching to develop, but the whole thing was just painted in such broad strokes that the result was laughable. The message of the film (""Sometimes it takes getting shot in the head to change you from an @- hole to a great guy!"") is cheesy and obvious. This crew of folks is capable of producing much more complex art.Sadly, this ain't it.",Regarding Henry
94,iluvmua,Lesson in life,10,21 January 2007,"Awesome movie with a message. This is a spoiler, so if you want the story to be a surprise, do not continue reading.I can't help but love this movie. It's what the average person thinks of very wealthy America (or maybe Hollywood), married couple, busy with their own agenda, very well off, both having affairs and about to ship their daughter off to boarding school. Ford is a very successful lawyer who, like the firm he works for, will stop at nothing to win his case, even to the point of doing unethical and illegal things. Then tragedy happens. He is involved in a shooting. He's seriously injured, loses his memory. As the story evolves he realizes he doesn't like who he was. It just goes to show you, the world shouldn't revolve around money, status, and keeping up with the Jones. If this one is on, I watch it. Go rent it, you won't be disappointed.",Regarding Henry

Nonetheless it is still not so late to add a comment. I have read the comments of others against this movie-- that it is so predetermined and the script sucks... But that is not the point. The point is that this movie is making us realize the things that we have taken for granted because of fame, career, pride, money and social system. This movie takes us back that what matters most here in our life on earth are FAMILY and FRIENDS. This only shows that most of us, if not everyone, have to be shot first at the head(brain) and near the heart to make this realization that what most of us value is not important. There should be a radical change of mind and heart to make our lives more meaningful.",Regarding Henry
97,cmingo01,Reaffirming values of life and family!,10,4 December 2010,"Movie viewers searching for a break away from the traditional shallow and sleazy action in movies would find Regarding Henry to be not only inspirational, but also biblical in its approach: leaning towards a theme equivalent to what the bible teaches about a man profiting much but at the risk of losing his soul. Some may label this film to be shallow and predictable and according to ""film industry standards,"" this observation may very well be valid; however, movie watchers like me look for a deeper meaning in movies where the main character is brought from pride to humility. Always trying to be politically correct by evaluating movies according the requirements of their genre can often times rob the deeper meaning to movies such as Regarding Henry. It may very well seem obvious and typical that a movie director would not allow his main character to remain in such a feeble state such as Harrison Ford, the main character in this movie, found himself to be in. But not only did Mike Nichols, the director, not leave Henry in such a state, he made this character to embrace a new life in such a way that his audience could reflect on their own life and reconsider that family, character, integrity, and being an honest human being are some of the most important aspects of life.",Regarding Henry

After watch Regarding Henry the truth will be revealed and you will know that the popular view most have of life is a lie. Harrison Ford has always been one of my favourite adventure and action male actors, but this is a very different character then we had seen previously of him. He has done a great job as a drama character and by the end of the film, you can't help but love him. Annette Bening gives us a view of the loving and support wife...we could only wish that after some tragedy strikes a family love and strength would shine through, but there are also some surprises along the way that confirms, 'we are human, nobody is perfect'. The encouraging part is love and forgiveness help us ""humans"" to go deeper, and sometimes the best way to view life is through the eyes of a child or innocent. The overriding emphasis is on family relationships and second chances, after cancelling out those superficial ones with shallow people who are no longer important in your life.

Now, I'm in college studying to be a physical therapist like Bradley. Without this movie, clichéd though it can be at times, I would probably never have considered physical therapy.This movie is not the greatest movie in the world, to be sure. But there is something magical about it that makes it so beautiful. Harrison Ford is just amazing. UH-mazing.This movie will make you, it will make you cry, and in the end, you'll be glad you went on that emotional roller coaster. But then, it could just be my sappiness taking control.

103,flamingokat,I really liked this movie...,8,14 August 2005,"No matter how many times I watch this movie it always sends me through a long range of emotions. Harrison Ford's transformation from the hard nosed, unfeeling super lawyer to the loving, family oriented man he becomes is a journey well worth the trip.The casting of Harrison Ford as Henry was a great choice. With his lopsided grin and eyes that changes from hard flint to affable glitter within a few scenes reminds me in many ways of Jimmy Stewart's ability to do the same. I'm not sure if Ford is on the same caliber as Stewart, but he is the closest we have to that generation of actors.Annette Bening is wonderful as Henry's wife, Sarah. Bening brings to her character the warmth, understanding, and all too human choices that make their character's marriage seem very real.Mikki Allen, who plays their daughter Rachel, is an extremely talented young woman. It was a joy to watch her character change from a child object to the teacher to a beloved daughter. Her performance brought a welcome grounding to the family side of the story.Bill Nunn (Bradley, the physical therapist) is my favorite supporting actor in this movie. It is his performance that gives the Henry character the courage to change and tackle life's obstacles. The scrambled egg scene is a classic which most people remember.The acting by the peripheral lawyer characters, Mary Gilbert (Julia), Donald Moffat (Charlie), Bruce Altman (Bruce), and Rebecca Miller (Linda), contribute substantially to this movie's success in showing how competitive and self-serving ""big city"" life can be.This movie, as I recall, did not receive any major awards or acclamations, which is a shame because it retells a wonderful life experience in an easy going way that is fun to watch. It is uplifting, has wonderfully portrayed characters, has some imaginative twists and turns, and has an ending that, although predictable, still manages to be humble and worth the wait.I really like this movieor could you tell?",Regarding Henry
104,sambinder,Underated film,9,7 January 2018,"I have read the multiple low ratings given to this film by the likes of Ebart and others. My response is somewhat simple, but first I have to concede that I watch drama films not as documentaries. ALL fiction is contrived. So what?What is special to me about this film is that Harrison Ford plays the character rather well. I am an emergency physician, and I know that a gun shot wound to the head, if survivable, is fraught with life changing effects. However, this is NOT the point of the movie.To me, the point of the movie is to reflect on MY humanity (or lack thereof). By watching his character go through rehab and, ultimately, arrive at his own sense of what he wants to be, I feel vindicated, in my mind, because I have become the person who I want to be. It IS personal to me! Not my job, not any wealth, but the essence of who I am, stripped from all the material passions confronting this world we live in. I have lived long enough to appreciate what is important to me. I am lucky enough to have discovered this quite long ago. Those who are unable to appreciate their own humanity AND humility are the truly poor among us.Who among us wants our epitaph to read ""He made a lot of money!""?",Regarding Henry
