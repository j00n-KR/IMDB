0,TheLittleSongbird,Just as delightful as the first one!,8,11 May 2009,"I do think the first Shrek is better, but this is a delightful film that is just as funny and imaginative than its predecessor. Here we are introduced to new characters, such as Puss In Boots, marvellously voiced by Antonio Banderras. (Puss's look of innocence with the eyes was so sweet) The original voice cast return and are given fresh and very well-done material that they make the most of. Eddie Murphy mayn't be to everyone's taste, but I personally thought he was very funny, especially when he keeps saying ""Are we there yet?"" The new characters are well done, though I am not hugely fond of Jennifer Saunders as the Fairy Godmother, though I really did like John Cleese, Julie Andrews and Rupert Everett. The animation is just as lovely as it was in the first. The only other criticism I have of the movie, is that the plot isn't always as involving as the one in the original. But it is still rock-solid entertainment, for everyone to enjoy. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",Shrek 2
1,SnoopyStyle,Nice fitting sequel,8,29 March 2014,"After Shrek (Mike Myers) marries Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) in the first movie. Donkey (Eddie Murphy) has been watching the hovel while they're on their honeymoon. Then they get a summons from Fiona's parents (Julie Andrews, John Cleese) in Far, Far Away. The trio goes to Fiona's home to find an uneasy acceptance of what has happened. Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) returns after not finding Fiona in the tower. He and his mother Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) try to split Shrek away from Fiona. They threaten the King who in turn hires Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) to kill Shrek.There are some great additions to the cast of characters in the Shrek world. The main trio's chemistry is maintained while Puss form a new trio with Shrek and Donkey. It is just as good as the first one. It takes the situation and spins it into a family drama. The main idea of acceptance is expanded as the parents try to accept the Ogre into the family. It's a perfectly fitting sequel after the happily ever after.",Shrek 2
2,claudio_carvalho,Excellent and Worthwhile Sequel,10,6 November 2004,"When Shrek and Fiona return from their honeymoon, they receive an invitation of Fiona's royal parents for a dinner party in their castle. Shrek does not want to go, but he is convinced by Fiona to visit her parents, who do not know that they are ogres. They go with the company of Donkey to the Far Far Away kingdom to meet the Queen and the King. Expecting for a beautiful Fiona and an enchanted prince, the King is completely disappointed by Fiona's choice, and plot an evil plan against Shrek with the Fairy Godmother, who wants that her son Prince Charming marries Fiona. The sword fighting cat Puss-in-Boots is also hired by the King to kill Shrek, who is helped by his friends to recover Fiona. I glanced the tough titles of some user comments and I am not sure whether these viewers saw the same film as I did. I usually hate sequels, but 'Shrek 2' is an excellent and lovely sequel, in the same level of the first one, having lots of funny jokes and details. The kiss of Shrek and Fiona on the beach à la Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in 'From Here To Eternity' would be enough to make 'Shrek 2' a worthwhile movie. I saw 'Shrek 2' in the original English audio, and now I intend to see it again spoken in Portuguese. The dubbing in Portuguese in the first 'Shrek' was perfect, and I want check how it is in this sequel. ""Shrek 2"" is an entertainment recommended for the whole family. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'Shrek 2""",Shrek 2
3,kosmasp,Another one,7,21 July 2009,"It's almost a shame to write this, but it seems Eddie Murphy's best movies in recent history are animated (so you're not even seeing his face). Some say the same about Mike Myers, but one thing is for sure: After the second part was good, they did follow with part 3 which was really weak (more about that when I write a comment and rate Shrek part 3)! This movie continues the story, where we left off after Shrek ended. With a few nice touches and quite a few jokes, this really works because of the character interactions and one major new player: Antonio Banderas ""Cat"". The cat got so popular, that it will get it's own spin-off. If you liked part 1 then, go ahead and watch this one too",Shrek 2
4,gavin6942,I Liked This Better Than Shrek One (So Sue Me!),8,17 December 2006,"Shrek and Fiona travel to meet Fiona's parents, who are less than thrilled that Fiona has married an ogre (though they seem to ignore the fact she has turned into one). The King devises a plan with the Fairy Godmother to get Fiona to leave Shrek for Prince Charming (which seems brilliant if we ignore all the laws about marriage, possibly inapplicable in the fairy world). Shrek won't sit back and let Charming steal his bride, though. Heck no.I liked this movie better than the first one. It was another great combination of humor, adventure and romance. I found the humor much funnier and more consistent this time, really pandering to the adults. The catnip joke and the subtle use of the word ""pussy"" (related to Puss in Boots) are noteworthy. The movie was fast-paced and ended so fast, it could have been much longer, whereas the first film needed more time for character development.My favorite aspect was that Eddie Murphy's character wasn't played up as much, meaning less abrasive shouting in this film. No offense to Murphy, but he is annoying and I really didn't need him in the movie at all. Giving him the back seat he had this time was an improvement. If only ""Shrek 3"" had him removed.I watched this with a 5-year old child, who loved Puss in Boots. Personally, I love the Gingerbread Man the best. And I think this movie has that going for it: almost everyone should be able to find a character that stands out for them. Besides the child, I watched the movie with three other adults who all loved the movie.I also enjoyed the Shrek = black man element. Much of this was like ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and that's always an important message (that racism is stupid). Has this been overdone? Yes. But this is an animated sequel, cut them some slack. Compared to the sequels Disney pumps out (like ""Little Mermaid 2"") this was like the movie of the year.The American Idol scene ruined the movie for me, but I was able to block it out for the most part and hopefully will some day forget it entirely. Ignoring that, this movie is a charmer and very spectacular. See this, even if you have no kids.",Shrek 2
5,lee_eisenberg,"It's a sequel, not that there's anything wrong with that.",8,18 October 2005,"Never before have I seen such a clever sequel. I don't know whether or not ""Shrek 2"" specifically outdoes its predecessor, but it certainly equals the latter. This one has Shrek (Mike Myers), Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) going to the kingdom of Far Far Away to meet Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews). Needless to say, the parents are shocked when they see that their daughter has married an ogre. Further throwing a wrench in the works are the presences of swashbuckling Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) and jealous Prince Charming (Rupert Everett).Aside from the fact that it never gets ridiculous or formulaic, ""Shrek 2""'s strength lies in its popular culture references. Almost any movie, any TV show, or any song that you can imagine, they spoof it here. Whether it's Sir Justin (Timberlake, that is), Far Far Away's resemblance to Beverly Hills, or any of the quotes, this movie pulls no punches. A treat for all ages.",Shrek 2
6,jboothmillard,Shrek 2,8,18 March 2005,"This is a very good sequel to the original fairytale never told, but it doesn't exactly have all the magic and interest of the first one. Shrek (Mike Myers) and his new wife Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) have just come back from their honeymoon. When they get there they discover that Donkey (Eddie Murphy) has been looking after the house at the swamp. Then they hear from the King's servants that he wants to see Fiona (their daughter) and his new husband. When they arrive at Far Far Away the King (John Cleese) and Queen (Julie Andrews) get quite a shock when they see their daughter looking like an ogre, and being married to one. But to make matters worse, Price Charming (Rupert Everett) was sent to the castle that Fiona was in, and his mum, the nasty Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) is adamant for the King to get rid of Shrek, he even hires fairytale favourite Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) to kill him, but he turns instead into a friend. Shrek meanwhile steals a potion from the Fairy Godmother's lab, and after drinking it turns himself and Fiona, oh and Donkey, beautiful (human). Shrek is now desperate to get back to Fiona, before Prince Charming kisses her before midnight, and they turn back into ogres. Also starring Joan Rivers as herself. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Accidentally In Love"" (also nominated the Golden Globe) and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it won the BAFTA for the Kids' Vote, and it was nominated the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film. Along with the first film, both were number 6 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!",Shrek 2
7,ccthemovieman-1,Why I Liked 'Shrek 2' Better,9,19 March 2006,"I much preferred this sequel, even though I also liked the original, too, as millions of other viewers - kids and adults - did. This second edition, to me, was better than the first one for the following reasons:1 - A faster-paced story; 2 - Better colors, just gorgeous with a 3-D effect in spots; 3 - another great combination of humor, adventure and romance; 4 - no one segment of the story overstayed its welcome; 5 - Eddie Murphy's character wasn't played up as much, meaning less abrasive shouting in this film; 6 - a genuine touching ending which left the viewer very satisfied.Some of these qualities were all there in abundance in first Shrek, too, but the package was more complete here. It was softer, kindler, gentler Shrek film than the first. Murphy is a funny guy but his incessant talking can get on anyone's nerves, but with less to say, that didn't happen in this sequel.",Shrek 2
8,Tweekums,A sequel that is every bit as good as the original,9,8 January 2017,"As this sequel begins the dashing Prince Charming races to rescue Princess Fiona from the Dragon's Tower and learns she is no longer there; she is on her honeymoon. Meanwhile Fiona and Shrek are just getting home to the swamp. They haven't been back long when they receive an invitation to visit Fiona's parents; the King and Queen of the country of Far, Far away. Shrek thinks it is a bad idea that is bound to end in disaster but Fiona insists and they end up going, along with Donkey. Once they arrive it would appear that Shrek was right; Fiona's father isn't happy with her choice of husband and is soon plotting to get rid of him. He isn't the only person wanting Shrek out of the way; Fairy Godmother is keen to get him out of the picture so Fiona can marry her son; Prince Charming.Sequels that are as good as the original aren't all that common but this is a good example of one that is just as good. Most of the original characters are back again; although this time Fiona spends most of the time as an ogre, which I preferred. There are also plenty of great new characters; most notably Puss in Boots, a feline Zorro voiced by Antonio Banderas; Fairy Godmother, the villain of the film voiced by Jennifer Saunders and Fiona's Parents, voiced by John Cleese and Julie Andrews. There is plenty of action throughout as well as a good number of laughs. There are also lots of references to other films that should be a treat for older viewers without spoiling the enjoyment for youngsters. We also get a good number of well-known songs; the most entertaining being when Fairy Godmother sings 'Holding Out for a Hero' at the ball. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the original.",Shrek 2
9,michaelRokeefe,Love is an adventure.,6,28 May 2004,"This is an entertaining(but maybe less magical)sequel to the runaway animated smash and Oscar winning hit of 2001. Not down a yellow brick road, but more like over hill and dale and mountain top to far and far away. Shrek(Mike Myers), Princess Fiona(Cameron Diaz)and Donkey(Eddie Murphy)do go to Far Far Away to get the blessing of Fiona's father. Unknowing to Shrek and Fiona her parents the King(John Cleese) and Queen(Julie Andrews)have summoned the aid of Puss in Boots(Antonio Banderas)to break up the couple. Puss becomes an ally when the Fairy Godmother(Jennifer Saunders)tries her best to make Fiona fall in love with Prince Charming(Rupert Everett). I really don't think I have spoiled anything, because viewing is the actual pleasure you'll experience. This is fun for the whole family. Even trading farts in the mud is somehow funny. If you haven't seen the original it is okay to go ahead and see it now...you'll be pleased you did. Still my favorite character is Donkey.",Shrek 2
10,studioAT,Another chapter of the Shrek saga,7,1 June 2011,Shrek was a massive hit so it's no surprise that this sequel soon followed in 2004 and again proved that sequels can be better than the original.The plot is kept simple with the addition of new characters only helping this to come across while also leaving lots of room for returning characters such as the gingerbread man to have their moment.This perhaps marked the high point of the Shrek saga as the two later sequels really lacked the spark that made these first two so great. Maybe Dreamworks got greedy and tried to create a franchise when there really wasn't scope for one.Overall a worthwhile sequel to watch but I would stop after this one before the lovable ogre starts to out stay his welcome.,Shrek 2

12,zardoz-13,"""Shrek 2"" reminds us that only real ogres have curves!",3,21 June 2007,"The new animated DreamsWorks' movie ""Shrek 2"" (** out of ****) recaptures only half the magic of its peerless, four-star, ground-breaking predecessor. Although the amusing animation by Pacific Data Images (PDI) lives up to--if not surpasses--the original ""Shrek,"" the humdrum 'meet the in-laws' plot recycles the shape-shifting shenanigans of the original but reverses who's afflicted without providing enough fresh humor or hysterically hair-raising heroics. This time around, our gallant but anti-social green ogre suffers the slings and arrows of outrageous skullduggery. In ""Shrek,"" Princess Fiona shape shifted from beauty to the beast between sunset and sun-up. In ""Shrek 2,"" Shrek himself shifts shapes from a monstrous lime-green ogre to a broad-shouldered hunkster who resembles a buffed-up Freddie Prinze Jr. with tousled forelocks fashionably awry above his affable eyes and his massive, virile jaw. Unlike the original, the comic tomfoolery in this contrived, uninspired sequel more often than not misses the funny bone, and the protagonists --Shrek and Fiona--appear curiously anemic. Basically, Shrek delivers little of the charisma that made his character so endearing and sympathetic in the first film. Meanwhile, several new comic characters show up in ""Shrek 2,"" such as the overconfident Puss-In-Boots and the garrulous Fairy Godmother, but they clutter up the plot and serve more to pad out its lackluster, 93-minute running time. ""Shrek 2"" consists of more flat scenes than funny ones, while its narrative revelations pale beside the original. Whereas the first ""Shrek"" ridiculed the 'happily-ever-after ,' 'knight-in-shining armor,' 'save the damsel-in-distress' plot, the predictably sappy sequel gives action the short shrift and approaches its subject like a gabby soap opera. At the same time, Donkey gets the one-and-only best line in ""Shrek 2"" when he advises the ogre to give Puss-In-Boots 'the Bob Barker treatment.' Sadly, not even Donkey's clowning around enlivens ""Shrek 2,"" because the writers have diluted Donkey's character so that their underwritten sword-wielding cat can claim screen time. Nevertheless, these obvious shortcomings won't bother the kids in the audience, but adults may find themselves struggling to smile at the obvious jokes and the second-rate gags. Savvy, movie-going grown-ups will savor the many ultra-cutesy but disposable cinematic sight-gag references to other films, such as ""Spider-man,"" ""From Here To Eternity,"" and ""The Lord of the Rings,"" though these add little to the plot and stand out more as mind-tickling trivia.The original ""Shrek"" faded out with Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz of ""Charlie's Angels"") and Shrek (voice of Michael Myers of ""Austin Powers"") living happily ever after in his swamp with Donkey (voice of ""Beverly Hills Cop"" Eddie Murphy) as their unwanted neighbor intruding on them at the worst possible moments. Inevitably, Fiona's parents--Queen Lillian (voice of Julie Andrews of ""The Sound of Music"") and King Harold (voice of John Cleese of ""Die Another Day"")--invite our ogreish couple to their castle in the kingdom of Far Far Away Land. Shrek dreads meeting the parents. He fears Fiona's father won't approve of him. Can we say miscegenation? At the same time, Fiona's meddlesome Fairy Godmother (voice of Jennifer Saunders from the ""Absolutely Fabulous"" TV series) wants her worthless Prince Charming son (voice of Rupert Everett from ""My Best Friend's Wedding"") , originally betrothed to Fiona, to win her heart after Fiona breaks up with Shrek. Meanwhile, conniving King Harold pays a swashbuckling feline assassin, Puss-In-Boots (voice of Antonio Banderas of ""The Mask of Zorro""), to eliminate our hero. Later, the scheming Fairy Godmother gives Shrek and Donkey a potion that transforms them into a super hunk and his snorting stallion respectively, while Fiona falls victim to a spell that makes her vulnerable to the first fellow she kisses. Prince Charming sets out to make his conquest during a dance while Shrek struggles to find Fiona. Puss- In-Boots changes sides after he fails to skewer Shrek, and nearly all the original fairy tale characters come to Shrek's aid, especially the giant Gingerbread Man who storms the castle until he is drenched in milk .Originally, DreamWorks made no plans to produce a sequel, until ""Shrek"" coined over $482 plus million both domestically and overseas. Since ""Shrek 2"" has sold $353-plus million dollars worth of tickets, you can expect a second sequel. Hopefully, the second sequel will fare better than this first sequel. ""Rugrats"" scenarist J. David Stern along with original ""Shrek"" scribes Joe Stillman and David N. Weiss have penned an old-fashioned, off-centered fairy tale yarn that just simply isn't as side-splitting as the first ""Shrek."" Mind you, some of the satiric product placement witticisms will amuse you, with derivative products such as Burger Prince (Burger King), Olde Knavery (Old Navy), Saxon Fifth Avenue (Saks Fifth Avenue), Romeo Drive (Rodeo Drive), Versarchery (Versace), Gap Queen (Gap Kids), Farbucks Coffee (Starbucks), and Tower of London Records (Tower Records). That is part of ""Shrek 2's"" problem, its background and popular movie references are more funny than its half-baked, hackneyed plot. Ironically, ""Shrek 2"" comes at a time when Americans are being chided about the dangers of obesity. As ogres, Shrek and Fiona both are plug-ugly and obese. Interestingly, when they change shapes and emerge as attractive, they sacrifice what little personality that their physical afflictions gave them. I loved the original ""Shrek,"" and I watched again it before I saw ""Shrek 2."" Anybody who says ""Shrek 2"" tops ""Shrek"" must have seen an altogether different movie. In the end, however, ""Shrek 2"" reminds us that only real ogres have curves!",Shrek 2
13,grantss,Wonderfully funny and fun,7,14 May 2016,"Wonderfully funny and fun.Picking up where the first Shrek movie left off, Shrek and Fiona are now happily married and living in Shrek's house in the swamp. Donkey reappears, much to Shrek and Fiona's annoyance. The King and Queen of Far Far Away hear of their daughter's (Fiona) marriage and invite Shrek and Fiona to the palace to celebrate. When the King discover's that Shrek is an ogre he is immediately opposed to the marriage. Prince Charming, who is determined to marry Fiona, appears and he and the King band together to separate Shrek and Fiona and get Fiona to marry Prince Charming. The Fairy Godmother also appears, and she is not as benevolent as you think.Good fun, with some great jokes. Mixes medieval settings with modern in-jokes and parodies. Quite clever, some of the jokes - definitely not just a movie for kids. Rollicks along at a good pace. There are some silly sub-plots but these don't consume too much of the time and are glossed over through the frenetic pace.Great use of well-known characters from children's fables, eg Puss in Boots, Pinocchio, The Three Little Pigs.Superb animation, as you would expect from DreamWorks. Spot-on voice casting too. Pick of the bunch, for me, is Jennifer Saunders as the Fairy Godmother. She gets some of the best lines and her deliver is brilliant.There is a large amount of music in the movie, not to the extent that it is a musical (thankfully), but enough to make it more than just background. The songs are a bit hit-and-miss. Some (eg Eels' ""I need some sleep"") fit in well with the movie and help the tone, while others just feel like populist fluff. On the whole, the choice of music hinders more than helps the movie.Overall, an entertaining way to spend 1 1/2 hours or so.",Shrek 2
14,Boba_Fett1138,It tries too hard...,7,8 November 2004,"The movie tries too hard to be more funnier and more clever than the first ""Shrek"". In many ways the humor is successful but then again on the other hand, the movie also fails on many fronts.First of all, I liked the first ""Shrek"" movie, even though I never understood why that movie was loved and praised by so many. I found it a bit overrated you may say. ""Shrek 2"" is also a overpraised and overrated movie in my book but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie of course!Main reason why I didn't liked this movie that much is the story. At least the first movie had a more clever story, ""Shrek 2"" just has a simple and less funny story. The movie also lacks a good villain, Fairy Godmother just ain't no Lord Farquaad. And like Donkey already said: ""The position of annoying talking animal has been filled"", so Puss In Boots voiced by Antonio Banderas totally felt like a needless character, no matter how nice and cool he was. I'm also not very happy what they did with some of the best and most fun characters from the first ""Shrek"" movie. They gave the characters Pinocchio, Three Pigs, Gingerbread Man and the Three Mice a bigger role, a bit too big for my taste. They should stay talking background characters and not some kind of semi-main characters. I also found the music to be a bit of a disappointment, not only the songs but also the original soundtrack by Harry Gregson-Williams, the first ""Shrek"" movie had a very cool and excellent soundtrack, something this movie is really missing (was he in a hurry or something?).The animations are an improvement though, especially the way the characters walk and some of the humor is still hilarious even though it feels a bit forced at times.Not as good as I wanted it to be, still looking forward to Shrek 3 & 4 though!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Shrek 2
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A great sequel,8,8 September 2004,"When I sat down in the theater to watch this, I was almost expecting to be disappointed; the first was so great, I couldn't imagine that it could possibly be as good. I was pleasantly surprised. It's at least as good as the first, but I wouldn't call it better. The plot is about as good as the first; if possibly a bit more far-fetched, most likely due to the sequel not being planned when they made the first(or maybe Andrew Adamson is just a one-idea guy). The voice-acting is great, at least as good as it was in the first, and the new additions to the cast are all great and well-chosen. The characters are well-written, credible and their voices well-cast. Despite being fairy tale characters, all of them are actually funny and a few of the main characters even have personality. I liked how, whereas Donkey was the source of comic relief in the first, now he has someone to play against, namely Puss In Boots. In the first, we met Donkey and got to know how annoying he can be... this time, he's still annoying, but now he meets his match, the Puss In Boots. I really liked their constant fighting, and the Puss himself was hilarious, even when he wasn't playing against Donkey. I liked that Shrek and Fiona had more personality in this one. The tone also seemed more adult, whereas the first was kind of children's film combined with adult humor. The humor is still the same in this one though; as crude as it was in the first. The gags and jokes are very funny, just like in the first, and I didn't think that any of the material was recycled, though the humor is very much the same. I liked the way the fairly tale creatures and characters were implemented in the movie, many of them had tiny roles and bit parts, but were hilarious all the same. Most of the characters from the first one have parts in this one too, though all but Fiona, Shrek and Donkey have small roles. All the parodies are great, and well-implemented as they should be. I loved the scene after the credits, with a nice little epilogue to the story. Great stuff. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed the first, or anyone who enjoys crude humor and saw the first(otherwise you'll probably have no clue whatsoever to what's going on). A worthy sequel. 8/10",Shrek 2
16,view_and_review,Bigger better cast of characters,7,28 February 2007,"Shrek is back and he has to meet his in-laws... is this a scary movie? Without a doubt, Shrek has issues with Fiona's parents right away, and we find out that even Ogres have marital problems. The story is good, very comparable to the first Shrek, plus how can you not love the characters? The characters are what make this movie. The regulars such as Shrek and the incomparable Donkey are, of course, great. But even the new characters added some excellent flare. Puss in Boots (the cat)(Antonio Banderas) was classic, and the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) was just gold.This movie was actually better when I watched it the second time and got to see a lot of the scenes over again. I can honestly say that much of this movie would go right over the head of young kids. The comedy is fairly sophisticated at times with enough child humor to keep children entertained (as if that's hard).",Shrek 2

They fall foul of a Fairy Godmother who wishes her son to marry the Princess and is prepared to use assassin Puss In Boots to achieve her goal.Shrek 2 is very good, but it is not as good as its predecessor. For one thing, the startling originality is now second hand. For another, the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming are unpleasant and have few laughs.On the positive side, Puss in Boots (and Antonio Banderas' silkily menacing vocalisation) is an absolute delight, and Julie Andres and John Cleese are very good as the King and Queen.This is well worth seeing, but don't expect it to be as good as the first one.",Shrek 2

Shrek objects at first but then goes along accompanied by his trusty talkative friend Donkey. The reunion isn't successful as we learn that Fiona was intended to marry Prince Charming under a deal made by the fairy godmother. Solid work of three directors, Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon. Mike Myers voices Shrek who loves Fiona enough to risk certain transformations. Eddie Murphy voices Donkey who remains his annoying yet loyal self. The whole marrying the dragon bit I will never understand though. Cameron Diaz voices Fiona who is torn between Shrek and her parents. Ultimately she will prove Prince Charming disposable during the climax. Antonio Banderas voices feline Puss 'n' Boots who was hired to rid Shrek but ends up helping him when Shrek proves too disarming . He will assist in the climatic battle in the end. Rupert Everett is a steal as the scheming Prince Charming. Like the original it exposes fairy tale clichés while still being wonderfully entertaining. Score: 8 / 10",Shrek 2
19,HotToastyRag,The best story of the four,8,29 September 2021,"Children learn that every fairy tale ends with ""And they lived happily ever after"", but there have been entire classes devoted to the damage done to children by reiterating that phrase. Some argue that children should be taught of life's realisms, rather than allow them to imagine perfection after marriage. If you agree with that school of thought, you're probably going to want to show your kids the entire Shrek franchise. In three of the four movies, Shrek and his wife Fiona have major problems!The second movie's problems begin at home. Not their home; because of course, being huddled together in the swamp would suit them just fine. But when Fiona has to break the news to her parents that she's not only married, but married to an ogre, and has taken the form of an ogre herself, it's quite a blow. King John Cleese and Queen Julie Andrews are understandably upset, especially because they had their hearts set on their daughter marrying Prince Charming (perfectly cast as Rupert Everett). The family secrets run deep, and just like in the first movie, the audience sees that traditional fairy tale characters are not what they seem. Plot for plot, the second Shrek movie captures my vote for the most interesting storyline. If you find the twists, turns, and reveals to be more important than the jokes, this one will probably be your favorite. That's not to say this one isn't funny, because it is! And the large-eyed adorable Puss in Boots gets added to the entourage of sidekicks, which is very cute.",Shrek 2

Shrek and Fiona are returning from their honeymoon, only to find a dejected Donkey who broke things off with Dragon apparently and the King's noblemen inviting them to Fiona's parents castle in Faf Far Away. Naturally the anti-social Shrek wants nothing to do with the invitation, but gives in to Fiona and Donkey's insistence. Needless to say the King is quite upset to find his daughter an Ogre and married to Shrek. Add the dastardly vain Prince Charming, a not so good Fairy Godmother and the delightful new addition of Antonio Banderas as Puss In Boots, and you get a fun, but ultimately unneeded sequel that treads to closely to the first plot-wise.

Parents will still chuckle every now and then, and it's still one of the better sequel's that I've seen.My Grade: B- Where i saw it: Cinemax on Demand (available till September 9th, 2005)",Shrek 2
21,The_Void,More entertainment from Myers and Co.,7,26 December 2004,"The original Shrek was enjoyable, if forgettable, entertainment. It worked better than most films of it's type because it was a fresh and original take on the classic fairytale and beneath it's over the top characters and general bravado, there was a rather touching love story that allowed audiences to care more than they would for the average animated picture. The sequel picks up where the original left off and sees Shrek and his bride, Princess Fiona visit her parents, much to Shrek and father's dismay. You see, Ogres aren't welcome at her father's palace, especially not when they're wed to his beloved daughter, and life is made very hard for our hero indeed. This prompts him, along with his trusty steed; the imaginatively titled 'Donkey', to set off on a quest to find a potion to put things right so that he and his princess will be able to live happily ever after (fairytale style!).This film isn't any better than the original, nor is it any worse; the two are on par with one another in terms of quality, and just different. Whereas the first film offered a love story, this one is more about acceptance and superficiality, and it actually works quite well. Of course, the message will no doubt be lost on the film's target audience (children), who will just enjoy the animation and fun of the picture, but the rest of us can enjoy the message. Also to be enjoyed about this film is the amount of film tributes - I counted many and probably missed a couple, but the most obvious ones are Alien and Raiders of the Lost Ark. The animation of the film is fabulous and undoubtedly DreamWorks' best yet. Even the regular humans in the tale look fine, and I have yet to say that for any other animated picture since this computer animation craze started. Shrek 2 also benefits from a number of big name voice actors including, obviously, Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy, but also John Cleese, Rupert Everett, Julie Andrews and Jennifer Saunders add their voices to the impressive roster, and not to mention Antonio Banderas in the memorable role of 'Puss in Boots'.Overall, like the first one; this isn't a great film. But it is great entertainment, and for that reason it is hard to dislike, and I recommend it if you like films of that nature.",Shrek 2
22,zetes,Total crap,5,8 November 2004,"Only slightly less bad than the original. The story is a little better, I suppose, and it adds a couple of amusing characters. Antonio Banderas would be the highlight as Puss In Boots, but he doesn't have nearly enough screen time. My favorite character was Jennifer Saunders as the villain, the Fairy Godmother. After that, though, the movie just sucks. How many dated jokes can they fit into one movie? Let's see, we have the 'Are we there yet?' gag, which The Simpsons made old in 1990. The ripples in liquid, which was done a million times the year after Jurassic Park came out. Is it really still funny 11 years later? In the first Shrek there were Macarena jokes, long after that song was forgotten. Here, we end with Ricky Martin's 'Livin' la Vita Loca' which was old and annoying before the original film even hit the theaters. And then there's a bunch of disgusting fart and snot jokes that even cheaply produced television shows would reject as too tasteless. The abundance of C-grade pop songs makes the film even more dreadful. I mean, what happened to Counting Crows? Their first two albums were great, and now they're doing one of the cheesiest love songs I've ever heard for this piece of garbage. And, worst of all, the animation is awful! Characters move around jerkily and there's little or no attention paid to physics. Just take a look at Pixar's The Incredibles to see the difference. Seriously, if Shrek 2 beats out The Incredibles for the Oscar this year, as the original beat out the far superior Monsters Inc., I will be as sad as I was at the results of the recent presidential election. 5/10.",Shrek 2
23,mm-39,Good sequel,7,24 May 2004,"Spoilers!This film was a good sequel.  I love the voice of Eddie Murphy as Donkey, but the best had to be Puss, the voice of Antonio Banderas. The hair ball scene was great and you would understand completely if you have a cat.  In all, the story was a continuation of the first.  We follow the lifes of Shrek and the cast from after the wedding.  We learn more about the curse that was put upon Princess Fiona.  My opinion is that they should of stayed as normal looking people after taking a potion.  I love the end where they showed Donkey and the Dragon having mutant dragon/donkey offspring.  Puss does a good job singing. Parts of the story were swipes at LA and the Hollywood community.  I wonder if the fairy godmother was supposed to resemble Martha Stewart?  Good for both adults and children 7/10",Shrek 2
24,Mr-Fusion,Shrek's b-side material,6,14 August 2017,"Although largely a fun endeavor, ""Shrek 2"" is in full franchise mode, trading in some of the original's spark for a dose of cynicism. The story's a retread of the inner beauty theme from the first movie; one that grinds things down once Shrek becomes human, and picks right back up when Gingerbread Man shows up. The three leads are still harmonious, and the new characters are also enjoyable; but aside from one really good cat joke, it feels like a step down.6/10",Shrek 2
25,Smells_Like_Cheese,Are you serious? I thought Shrek 2 was so much better than the first!,10,14 November 2006,"As much as I enjoyed the first Shrek, I honestly almost died laughing and loving Shrek 2. The first Shrek was sweet and innocent, but the second took us to a different edge with terrific animation and just drop on the floor laughable jokes. Antonio Bandares as the cat was just such a great addition to the cast, he just killed me! I don't understand why Shrek 2 wasn't on the top 250, how could someone not enjoy this Shrek? Shrek and Fiona are now married and happy ogres, that is until Fiona's parents wish to see her and her new hubby. Fiona was supposed to marry Prince Charming, which ruined her fairy godmother and dad's plans, so her dad hires a hit-cat to slay Shrek, but fails, but since Shrek spars his life, the cat stays with Donkey and Shrek. Shrek wants so badly for Fiona to live happily ever after, so he and Donkey take a potion from the fairy godmother and have little time to make sure it stays permanent.Like I said, the Cat was my favorite character, especially when he and Donkey since Livin' La Vida Loca, I thought that it was so cute. Also when he stops the guards in the palace and gives them the cute kitty look. I just don't understand why no one got into the sequel as much as I did, otherwise this would be higher on the rating, and probably above the first Shrek.10/10",Shrek 2
26,MovieAddict2016,Funnier than the original,9,10 July 2004,"I was not a huge fan of the original SHREK and think it is vastly overrated. Enjoyable, but not great. SHREK 2 bored me at first and I was unimpressed but after the half hour mark it suddenly picked up with the Puss in Boots' entrance. This is one of the funniest films I've seen this summer, crammed with pop culture references (love the COPS spoof and all the signs in the background of Far Far Away advertising fake films), and a surprising amount of adult humor -- more than the original. (""Catnip!"" ""Uh, that's not mine."")The jokes aren't quite as knowing as the first one and it spoofs fairy tales more than the first did. The original SHREK seemed more bent on poking fun at the whole hero-rescues-princess notion; SHREK 2 spoofs every classic fairy tale legend.Overall SHREK 2 is a pure summer delight and much funnier than the first. Somehow the approach to the series seems very different from the original SHREK (the simplicity, I suppose, is gone) but it's hilarious for all ages.4.5/5",Shrek 2
27,Rainey-Dawn,A Funny Sequel,9,23 October 2014,"Just as funny as the first movie - one of the best sequel films ever made. A lot of the time, a film's sequel (in particular comedies) will loose some of their appeal, luster, charm or humor - but not Shrek 2. Nothing was lost in this wonderful sequel. This twist on the fairy-tales we grew up with will leave you with a bellyache from laughing so hard.The entire voice cast was great in this movie. The script was well written and utterly humorous. The animators are topnotch too. The characters in the film are just, well, ""cool"" - very likable.The introduction of Puss in Boots really added a flare to the story along with added comedy. I can see why he got his own (spin-off) movie.9.5/10",Shrek 2
28,Buddy-51,another marvelous DreamWork creation,9,6 April 2005,"""Shrek 2"" is the delightful follow-up to the original 2001 blockbuster, which was a charming fractured fairy tale about a beautiful princess and a lime-green swamp ogre who fell in love and lived happily ever after. Or did they? As the second installment opens, all seems quiet on the domestic front as we find Shrek and Fiona living in wedded bliss deep inside an enchanted forest. One day an invitation arrives from Fiona's royal parents, inviting the two newlyweds to a banquet in honor of their nuptials. Over Shrek's strenuous objections, the couple journeys to the kingdom called ""Far, Far Away,"" but when Fiona's father gets a gander at who his daughter has married - as well as the ogre-like transformation that has taken place in Fiona herself - the King decides it's time to take matters into his own hands and bring an end to this union.The marvel of the ""Shrek"" movies is that they function on different levels for different audiences. Children enjoy them for their fast pace, elemental slapstick and bright, splashy backgrounds, while adults savor them for their sophisticated humor, sly parody, clever puns and playful anachronisms. As with the original, the pop culture references in ""Shrek 2"" come fast and furious, but the film also has fun turning the conventions of the fairy tale form inside out. What's impressive about both ""Shrek"" movies is that the filmmakers are willing to follow their instincts and imaginations wherever they lead them and, thus, the writers have the confidence to throw almost anything into the mix if it suits their purposes. As a result, the film feels continually fresh and inventive, constantly renewing itself as it goes along.There is excellent voice-over work by Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Rupert Everett and Jennifer Saunders, all of whom take full measure of each of their respective characters. But it is Eddie Murphy, as the insecure wiseacre sidekick, Donkey, and Antonio Banderas, as a Musketeering cat known as Puss-in-Boots, who wind up stealing the show.Visually, ""Shrek 2"" is nothing short of a masterpiece, a seamless blending of otherworldly fairy tale backdrops with contemporary urban images. It's hard to imagine how much further animation can go in creating worlds that are both surreal and strikingly believable at the same time.""Shrek 2"" is a rare treat for old and young alike.",Shrek 2
29,ElMaruecan82,"A little bit of ""Meet the Parents"", a little bit of ""Aladdin"" and the first ""Shrek"", but it's still good......",8,30 July 2016,"The impending doom on sequels' is that they inevitably lack the element of surprise and can hardly wow the audience with the same intensity than the original.But this is a double edged-sword because the more successful the first opus is, the more attractive the immediate sequel will be to herds of fans eager to see their beloved characters again. A sequel suffer by comparison only if the level is beneath the original's, otherwise, it is seen as a faithful continuation, style-wise, fun-wise, characterization-wise and quality-wise. I guess it's fair to say that ""Shrek 2"" belongs to that category of sequels and the opening gags make you quickly understand the movie will be swimming in safe waters as far as entertainment goes, and you only wish that it will manage to give you something you don't see coming. After all, as I said in the first film's review, Shrek, Fiona and Donkey are so multi-layered characters that ""Shrek"" wasn't a movie enough to use up all their potential.Many questions deserved answers, how about Fiona's parents, the very people who locked her in the tower so a Prince Charming would cure her from the spell and then she would come back? How about the very prince Charming whom Shrek stole the thunder, why not making a character out of him, one who'd cross the forests and deserts, climbs the highest tower only to find her gone, and with quite a hilarious replacement, that I won't spoil. In fact, the reason to be of the sequel can be reduced to one simple question: how about the hackneyed concept of 'And They Lived Happily Ever After'? Since ""Shrek"" was a parody of fairy tales, it made all the more sense to question the most formulaic aspect of fairy tales, the ending! And since ""Shrek""s magnificent ending opened more doors than it closed, I doubt the brainstorming session on the sequel's themes lasted very long.So, the set is tone with Charming (Rupert Everett) realizing he was stepped over by nothing but an ogre, and the two ogres enjoying a nice honeymoon, and the first big laugh comes from a parody of ""From Here to Eternity"" and a very naughty take on Disney. The honeymoon lasts the time of the ""Accidentally in Love"" song and when our greenish couple is back home, they have two visits: Donkey (who else?) as obnoxious and oblivious to his obnoxiousness as ever and representatives of the Royal Family, which means from Shrek's standpoint, his in-laws. And what can be more annoying than traveling to the Kingdom of Far Far Away, with the Donkey shouting ""Are we there yet"" every 2,5 milliseconds. The film almost affords the luxury to make a joke out of boredom and I asked myself, where this was going, not without concern, with the perspective of meeting the in-laws, I was waiting for the gags with the 'are we there yet?' question in mind.Anyway, the discovery of Far Far Away, which is like a fairy-tale version of Beverly Hills is one of the film's delights, and it is intelligently enhanced by the choice of the background music ""Funky Town"". The rest of the story is less funky as the King (John Cleese) and the Queen (Julie Andrews) try to restrain their emotions, and the laughs that come from the confrontation between the King and Shrek are fun but on a very adult way, even by the film's standards. So, we get to a brief but perceptible part where gags tend to rarefy and the film gets too dramatic for its own good, just the time to present the villainous Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) who happens to be the mother of Prince Charming. The film gets back to its trademark zaniness once a character makes his entrance: Puss in Boots, a cross between Garfield and Zorro and who else than Antonio Banderas to voice him in a self-parodying performance (there's a lot of things borrowed from his Mariachi).Any experienced movie buff will look at the cat as a gratuitous addition in order to spice up the story, and you know what, it's true but who cares? The animators are much aware about it so even the Donkey says ""the part of the annoying animal sidekick has been taken"". He's half right, except the cat isn't just a sidekick, he's the character for which the sequel is remembered, he's a great source of gags, because he's both funny when acting like a Zorro (the accent, the mannerisms) and even funnier when acting like a real cat: purring, coughing hairballs and having that sad face that make anyone go 'Aaaaaw'. It all comes to any rating of ""Shrek"" gets 1 or 2 points more thanks to the cat.And that was a salutary addition because the story, as exciting as it was, was getting slow before the cat came and after, felt like a reverse recycling of the first movie, this time, Shrek turns into a human version of the prince Charming (and so does Donkey who finally gets a taste of what being a noble steed is like) and together, they pull a sort of ""Prince Ali"" on Fiona, before the Godmother pulls a Jafar in a climax that owes its excitement to the music that plays in the background, and the involvement of all the characters that made the first film such a delight: the three pigs, the Gingerbread guy, Pinocchio and the wolf.So, with all its reference to the first film, to modern classics, to adult humor (in a kids-friendly way) ""Shrek 2"" is a solid continuation to the original one. Maybe ""Shrek 2"" shouldn't be compared to the original but to all the second opuses of successful series' starters, and on that level, it is a great one.",Shrek 2
30,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Never quite as good as its predecessor, but also never claims to be.",8,22 February 2018,"'Shrek 2 (2004)' doesn't manage to recreate the lighting in a bottle that came before it, but is still a competent sequel that's charming because it still seems to have been made with complete care. It starts to slightly pander to its genre and lose some of its satire, however (although this is replaced with a more cultural lampooning perspective that works well for its humour). It's never a bad film, and is in fact an extremely enjoyable one throughout, but it lacks that element that made the first stand out. Still, a unique story, funny writing, enthusiastic performances and some great pop culture references (which outweigh the not so great ones) make this an entertaining animation. It's never quite as good as its predecessor, but also never claims to be. 8/10.",Shrek 2
31,MLDinTN,more of the same but just not as good,7,17 May 2005,"The story picks up where if left off with Shrek and Fiona on their honeymoon. The conflict arises when Fairygodmother blackmails Fiona's dad, the king. She wants her son Prince Charming to be Fiona's husband. So Donkey tags along with Shrek, and they meet up with Puss in Boots who was hired by the king to get rid of Shrek. The three make their way to Fairygodmother's for help, not knowing she's up to no good. Shrek gets a potion that makes him and Fiona human, only to have Charming take his place. So, the ending is up to Shrek to expose the plot of Charming and his mother.FINAL VERDICT: In part 2, Donkey is no where near as funny and neither are the other jokes. It felt forced and lacking excitement, which the first one had. They need to stop here and not make a third one, but I've heard they are already planning it. All these sequels just ruin a great concept. But, watch it if you have to keep following the saga of Shrek.",Shrek 2

Now that I did, I really enjoyed this film more than I did the first time.This sequel is about when Shrek and Fiona travel to Far Far Away so she can introduce Shrek to her family. Unfortunately Shrek and the King do not get along. To make matters worse Shrek has to face dangerous foes in The Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming.I thought there were good jokes especially by my favorite character, Donkey. Puss in Boots is a welcome character and he made this movie work. I think the chemistry between Shrek and Fiona weakened a little from the first.Overall, this is a solid sequel.

38,johnnyboyz,"Snappy, wholesome and very funny in a number of places; Shrek 2 extends the invigorating politics of the first into a finer and more rewarding second showing.",7,11 May 2011,"This first Shrek sequel loses none of that high and mighty but exceedingly mirth-inducing attitude with which it has in regards to fairy tales; nursery rhymes and mythical tales. Indeed, the film opens in the vein of the first as if beginning with a fanciful fairytale we've all heard before when it establishes one character: ""Rode. For days and nights on end. Through scorching deserts and across mountain ranges. To a far off locale, and all in the name of true love"".......but then at the end of it all, complains about the blisters he got in doing it after having been more than disgruntled at what awaited him in the bed housing his damsel. When we begin, the titular Shrek (Myers) and his new wife Fiona (Diaz) are living the dream; the uppity old ogre from the first film has found somebody he doesn't mind within the radius of about fifty miles of the locale that is his secluded swamp, whereas Fiona has, in her own mind, found that true love-cum-happiness she always wished for - albeit under a differing guise to what she first presumed. Their co-existence is established via an array of popular movie moments, one romantic instance of which calls to mind that of 2004's other seasonal blockbuster Spider-Man 2; a semiotically driven instance bringing to mind the intense ties those predominant characters shared in said film and utilising that to act as an extension to where Shrek and Fiona are in relation to each other here. As was in the first film, Eddie Murhpy's character Donkey is still knocking about and as was in the first film, he's remains both overstaying his welcome in the company of the protagonists and annoying them with his chatter.This domestic bliss is broken by the arrival of a royal troupe of trumpeters and their messenger, a statement of which arrives with him informing Fiona that she must, at once, report home to her parents in a place known as The Kingdom of Far Far Away which they rule. Gripes aside, the threesome push off; once there, the kingdom being a very different locale to that of what a sheltered existence in a tower for most of one's life or the living in a swamp off of the land is like. Arriving to a track entitled ""Funky Town"", instilling a sense of niche, corporate credibility about proceedings, the trio uncover a place steeped in materialism; capitalism; supply; demand and a place which actually contains streets, roads, laws and an order - Shrek and the crew have their work cut out. The fact these fish are out of their proverbial waters are the least of their worries, Shrek's clashing with the John Cleese voiced King Harold, Fiona's father, the result of initial coming-togethers going awry; the expansive first dinner they all have together seeing Shrek positioned in front of a stuffed hawk mounted on the wall up and behind him as the proverbial vultures circle. Harold and Shrek's clashing carries with it an amusing undercurrent of class distinction, the fact Harold et al. are humans and Shrek is an ogre (running on how we all know human's react to such) are surface binary oppositions to that of Shrek's humble, essentially farm based background, up against that of the king and queen's rich, expansive and affluent lifestyle in this consumerist driven Dystopia.Things are complicated further when a hideous creation in the form of The Fairy Godmother (Saunders) arrives, a sort of grotesque extension of this world's ideologies; a celebrity in these parts whom whips crowds into frenzies and plays up to a kindred, spirited surface persona but is internally morally decrepit. Here is a creature whose idea of happiness is in the form of a tonic designed to gloss over all of life's problems, before quick-marching to a designated point in one's existence which encompasses artificially photogenic partners; lots of clothes and labels on top of rich, faux-rewarding surroundings – much rather than a conclusion someone may have reached naturally with somebody else for what it is they are.The film gleefully covers Shrek's exposure to such a world, threatening to contaminate his own beliefs and question his own position on such things in relation to Fiona, with whom his life was perfect before any of this even arrived. Oddly, however, it is Harold's own sub-plot which is arguably more affecting; a trip to a dingy tavern in a disguise the bouncer easily sees through not only implies a prior history of turning to these means to sort out a problem, but allows somewhat of a show-stealing turn to arrive in the form of a mercenary named Puss (spoofed from the centuries old Perrault ""Booted Cat"" novel) and voiced by Antonio Banderas in a send up of his Zorro role long enough after 1998's The Mask of Zorro but too prematurely in regards to said film's 2005 sequel.If anything, Shrek 2 is better than the first; a more involving effort, a film taking the politics and overall study with which was imbued in the first and advancing it a step further in what is a more exciting and substantial piece. Its narrative is additionally far more interesting; it makes better use of its antagonist on top of the film just having more of an immediacy to it and its attention to character is not limited to that of its leads, thus resulting in a better and more rounded piece. Some of Shrek 2's scenes of great drama hinge on instances such as an internal conflict of morals an elderly king has regarding his daughter's future; in the first, needlessly extended scene of an escape tidbit from a dragon's lair or sub-Graduate ""must stop the wedding"" sequences were utilised as more spectacle driven incidences of drama and peril. Smart, wry and devilishly funny, Shrek 2 is a more than substantial animation.",Shrek 2
39,filipemanuelneto,It knew how to honor its predecessor.,9,17 January 2021,"After such a remarkable success it was quite obvious that DreamWorks was going to produce a sequel to ""Shrek"". Of course, the first film always has the advantage of novelty, but personally I believe that this sequel has managed to match the initial film, both in quality as in spirit and ability to entertain us.The script takes the story more or less where the first film ended: Shrek and Fiona got married and are finally living together in the swamp. But news run fast, and they will soon receive a visit from a delegation from the kingdom of Far Far Away, ruled by Fiona's parents. The message invites them to a reception where they will be introduced to the kingdom. It turns out that Shrek knows he was never popular, and the fact that they are both ogres is going to be a cause for troubles. In between, they will also have the opposition and intrigues of Prince Charming and his mother, the powerful and maleficent Fairy Godmother.As I said, the film manages to keep the quality level of its predecessor and to honor it with a story that follows what we have already seen. Despite this, the film is not always as fresh and engaging as the first. Very well done and edited in a very competent way, the film works well and entertains us wonderfully, in addition to continuing to give us a very original alternative version of the fairy tales we were used to. The mixture of naive and innocent humor with adult themes continues to be visible throughout the film, which brings interesting and educational messages about stereotypes and the acceptance of those who are different. The film inherits almost all the cast and crew from the previous production and, thus, to the voices of Cameron Diaz, John Lithgow, Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, we have also some honorable additions such as Jennifer Saunders, Rupert Everett, the veteran and noble voices of Julie Andrews and John Cleese or the dense tones of António Banderas, which is one of the best novelties in the film due to the witty and well-idealized way he gave voice and spirit to Puss in Boots. Despite going unnoticed among the stars, I also want to highlight the good voice work of Conrad Vernon, who lends his voice to several characters in the film.At a technical level, the film is impeccable. DreamWorks invested a lot in this production, and it paid off: the film is visually elegant and beautiful, with excellent colors and pristine cinematographic work. I especially liked the way the realm of Fiona's parents turns out to be, in reality, a kind of joke with the city of Los Angeles, where the movie studios are located. They even put there the Hollywood Sign! The soundtrack is not as striking nor remarkable as that of the initial film, but I especially liked the opening song, ""Accidentally in Love"", and the version of ""Holding Out for a Hero"" by Jennifer Saunders herself.",Shrek 2
40,leplatypus,Berk !!!!! (TV),1,7 August 2005,"I don't understand how this animation can be the third success in the all-time box office.Sure, all the design is wonderful and the research has asked a lot of attention. Sure, the cat & the donkey, the piggies are funny characters, but the movie fails in all its intentions.A comedy which laughs at fairy tales: Well, except two brilliant scenes (the speeches at the arrival, and the following super), all humor is based on the American way of life. The magic castle is here, but it's look like Hollywood, even MacDonald, Pop Idol are present. This is the worst kind of humor: references. There is no surprise in it.Next, behind the smiles, the authors try to deliver a educational message, as any classic fairy tale. The problem is the choice of the subject: Is look important in life ? This question, again a typical American attitude, couldn't have been the greatest treason made to the spirit of fairy tale. Indeed, beauty is always the necessary (and shadowed) support of true basic educational messages (independence, curiosity, etc.). The look, glamorous or frightening is only the more visible sign for young children to learn the good feelings (friendship, honesty --- characterised by ""nice"" people) from the bad feelings (cruelty, liar, temper --- characterised by ""ugly"" people).So, Shrek keeps asking if ""ugly"" people can love ""nice"" princess, and finally, concludes that :YES !! 2 long hours to demonstrate an evidence (because, in his heart, he has good feelings) with an humor often not funny.That explains my bad recommendation of this sequel..",Shrek 2
41,TheMovieDiorama,Shrek 2 magically transports us to a hilarious quest through twisted fairytales.,8,22 May 2019,"The original was a smart outlook on classic Hans Christian Andersen stories with a modern spice added to produce a refreshing flavour. Well-rounded characters, witty dialogue and an unlikely romantic story at its heart. So, naturally, a sequel was going to get commissioned. Here we are, enduring ""blistering winds and scorching deserts"" to the destination of Far Far Away. And you know what? I'm not ashamed to say that Shrek 2 is one of the best animated sequels of all-time. Shrek and Fiona are invited to meet her parents, but when they arrive their welcomed party is disturbed by the sinister Fairy Godmother.Where was I? Oh yes! I bloody love this film. Its quality remains consistent, developing the already memorable characters even further by reaffirming their love for each other whilst introducing several new characters into the cauldron. Puss in Boots, Prince Charming, heck even the Muffin Man (yes, the one who lives on Drury Lane...) makes an appearance. Fiona's character was probably the most underplayed, considering her boisterous personality in the previous instalment, but it rarely deters from the poignant happily ever after plot that is oh so relatable for all the lovers in the world.Yet what makes this sequel that much better, is the outlandish use of comedy. It's hilarious! Whether Donkey is annoying the absolute Ogre excrement out of Shrek or Charming yearning for his ""mummy"" in times of turmoil. The balanced approach of both visual and literary comedy makes it accessible to pretty much everyone, and revisiting this years later I found myself discovering new subtle jokes that had me bawling. This is obviously executed exquisitely by the eccentric and likeable voice cast that bring these characters to life, not to mention the fluid stunning animation.Right! I can't hold it in any longer! I'm just ""holding out for a hero""...! Urgh. Simply put, Jennifer Saunders singing Bonnie Tyler's epic ballad was just sublime. Masterful. Frickin' fantastic. To the point that the entire sequence is in my list of favourite scenes of all time. No joke. I have the cover on my iPod, it's that good. The race against the clock excitingly creates that sense of urgency that, accompanied with the song, was perfect. I'm willing to give this film a perfect score just for that scene alone.Alas, there are issues. The excessive use of pop songs nearly every ten minutes does detract from the wonderful score that was crafted. Some work, such as Lipps Inc's ""Funky Town"" and Counting Crows' ""Accidentally in Love"", but most of them unfortunately feel out of place. The only other criticism is that the pace seems too brisk for its own good. There's a scene where Shrek discovers an evil plan and the scene then transitions to the Wedding Ball within a second. All of sudden we're in the final act with no prior development. Small nitpicks for a family film, but must be addressed regardless.Fortunately the vast majority of this sequel is perfect, bettering its predecessor in nearly every department. Fifteen years later and I'm still laughing at Donkey's shenanigans, that right there proves the magical lasting powers of Shrek 2. If only DreamWorks stopped making sequels, we would have that happily ever after...",Shrek 2
42,insomniac_rod,Who said sequels didn't live up to the original?,7,7 December 2008,"This sequel is more incisive, and witty than the original mainly because of the dark humor and situations.The plot gets better and is more fantasy-adventure oriented with the great humor that was what made the original an instant classic.Here the same characters repeat on the plot and also add something new. The movie is perfect and suits for all ages because children will love the fantastic characters and colors but won't understand most of the clever jokes, while adults won't be amused by the characters but will enjoy the adult-oriented humor. Also, it has drama that will make you feel symphaty for the main characters.This sequel has even musical numbers and everything you ask for in an animated feature.Watch it immediately if you haven't seen it.",Shrek 2
43,Anonymous_Maxine,Is this a spoof?,8,12 June 2004,"While Shrek 2 was another great, confectionery romp like the first one, the homages to old fairy tales and other movies are approaching the area of campy spoofs. I was just waiting for Leslie Nielsen to pop up somewhere. Fiona pulls a layer of mud off of Shrek's face, kissing him upside down like Mary Jane Watson in Sam Raimi's Spiderman, The Little Mermaid washes onto shore and Fiona throws her back to the sharks as though she were trying to steal Shrek away from her, she and Shrek enjoy a romantic time lit by the light of lots of little Tinkerbells in jars, Fiona becomes the Lord of the Ring, and Shrek later in the movie cooks up and is helped out by the Stay-Puft Gingerbread Man. This is all great stuff that movie buffs are sure to love, but a lot of the humor has gone downhill, not necessarily in the maturity department (the first movie was pretty immature at many points), but in the tact department (the first movie was immature, but tactfully so). As best as I can remember, for example, there were no loud fart jokes in part 1 that blew Shrek's untucked shirt out behind him from the force of the wind. Shrek has gone from moderate irritation and sarcasm to downright anger, and much of the entire first half of the movie is saved by a masterful performance from Antonio Banderas as the voice of Puss in Boots. Which is too bad, too, because once the movie gets going it goes right back to the same level of animated superiority of its predecessor. In Shrek 2, Shrek and Fiona are now married, as we saw in the end of the last movie, which necessarily brings the narrative to a slightly higher level of maturity, since the main characters are past a major point in their lives that most of their target audience is not even close to. Donkey has returned, uninvited again, but dearly loved by the audience at least as much as he is for some reason detested by Shrek. I think that the main problem with Shrek 2 is that the conflict is so minimized. Shrek is married now, and the prevailing conflicts in the movie are things like meeting the in-laws and keeping Fiona from being drugged into falling in love with another, more politically correct man, while part 1 was all about the fairy tale quests to slay the fire-breathing dragon and save the beautiful princess.Of course, even though he's married, Shrek is still an ogre and still has the manners and demeanor of an ogre, which are for some reason epitomized at a dinner with his new in-laws in order to create sort of a Meet the Parents type scene, except that the King, who Shrek is supposed to impress, apparently has table manners not too dissimilar from Shrek's. Maybe the movie's trying to say that there's really not much difference between royalty and ogres. In Shrek 1, Shrek saved the princess and won her heart (thanks in no small part to the fact that she has a little condition that turned her into a ogre at night). Now, in the sequel, the real Prince Charming, who Aesop might dictate should have saved her in the first place, goes to the highest chamber in the storybook castle to rescue her and finds only a gender-confused wolf there reading the latest copy of Pork Illustrated, and is understandably furious. Thus begins his quest to find the princess and win her heart, even though she has already been rescued (from the imprisonment imposed by the very parents Shrek is out to impress) and her heart already won.Responding to a summons from Fiona's parents, who want to meet their daughter's new husband, they go on a long journey to reach the kingdom of Far, Far, Away (with Donkey all the while asking if they're there yet), and are met with the expected shock of a kingdom and two parents not ready to welcome back two enormous, hideous ogres, and all manner of hilarious mayhem ensues. Joan Rivers also makes a cameo as Joan Rivers, commentating on the outfits of the stars as they parade down the red carpet.And by the way, who has a grudge against poor Pinocchio? Not only does he get caught wearing women's underwear, but it's a thong and he lies about it! And then, to add injury to insult, as it were, he gets turned into a real boy just in time to suffer a fall that would have shattered most of his brand new bones, and then he gets turned back into a puppet again! What did he ever do to deserve such shabby treatment??",Shrek 2
44,lisafordeay,This is a pure rip off of Beauty & the Beast yet its very funny,7,12 October 2010,"I got this on DVD a few years ago as I love the Shrek francise as its funny,smart,takes the mickey out of a few fairy tales(like Emnchanted which is another movie I love to death)and the charcthers are engaging.The sequel is about Shrek who is now married to Fiona and they go to see the in-laws(Fiona's parents)in Far Far Away. Of course Shrek is worried because her parents doesn't like the idea that their daughter is now an ogress and is married to an ogre who is so stubborn and unkind(Beast from Beauty & the Beast anyone)?. Meanwhile a dim-witted prince named Charming(who I think is gay) was trying to save Fiona but he was too late so his mother(aka the Fairy godmother) try to sabotage Fiona's marriage to Shrek.So Fiona's dad hires Puss in Boots to kill Shrek but he of course joins the crew with Donkey & Shrek. Shrek is unhappy so he decides to turn himself into a human(a cartoon version of Mike Myers who voices Shrek),while Donkey becomes a stallion and Fiona becomes human again all thanks to some magic potion that he found in the Fairy Godmother factory while he ,Puss and Donkey were in as they spotted the factory as they were in the forest.This sequel reminds me of Beauty & the Beast because you've got an ogre who is unhappy about being an ogre as he doesn't accept who he is cause he was never human and he becomes human in this while Fiona who was always a human becomes human again and she tells Shrek that she wants what every girl wants to live happily ever after with the ogre I married and of course you can see Lumiere,Cogsworth & Mrs Potts as cameos in this movie.I always liked the story of Shrek as it was similar to Beauty & the Beast and I like the whole story to it. I hated the fourth Shrek as it was so stupid(Avoid at all costs).If you love movies where they mock other films like Enchanted(highly recommend that you should watch this one). Then you will like this film.7/10",Shrek 2
45,FiendishDramaturgy,"Less Cynical, More Endearing.",8,9 March 2007,"The second installment of the Shrek franchise was less cynical, but more in your face than the first. The snide comments are still present, but they are presented this time in a family atmosphere, for the most part, and therefore were less sexual in nature. Mostly.The characters this time are more extravagant, less adventuresome, but at the same time, they cast a creative spin on older, more familiar storybook characters and reintroduced them into the Shrekiverse. I thought that was a smart move, considering the content and execution of this particular story line.I ultimately found this endeavor more enjoyable than the first. And, while the cynicism was still pervasive, it was less edgy and more family/child friendly than its predecessor.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Shrek 2
46,elshikh4,Original Sequel !,7,15 August 2009,"This is sure the exploitive sequel, and it isn't! It's not a riddle. It's the Hollywood sequel yet at its best condition ever: Better Than its Original. The first was fine, nice and evolving movie; where the folk story is reversed and still amusing. Here, it's the next level.The creative irony this time contains firstly the semblance / substance case: Shrek the ogre / Shrek the lover, the godfather kind fairy / the conspirator evil witch, even Puss in Boots's childish gaze / his nature as tough sword player. Then, secondly, it smartly applies to higher issues like: the publicity of the godfather fairy, the credibility of the TV news, the power of the king, etc.This movie achieves, in a lovely spirit, being a celebration of movies as the modern fairy tales, so Hollywood is the Very Very Far city; with too many references to endless movies and TV shows. Plus, it achieves being a hot self-mockery, where the looks isn't always true, with - for instance - moments like literally scavenging some stars off the red carpet, because they're simply garbage!It's the first movie's point of view all over again, but not with the paradox of only ogre and knight this time. It's about the ""ugly"" truth and the gaudy falseness, concentrating on one whole community / Hollywood as out-of-reality royalty vs. one honest genuine hero. It was clever to display how he exposes with his real ugliness all the fake beauty of the others, clarifying how that world misses this innate behavior or sacrificing love. And it was merciful not to see him beaten at the end, because this is a Hollywood fairytale after all!However, the best of it was its ability to be such a modern fairytale in the same time too. Despite the unoriginality of some elements that the plot uses from old folk stories (the midnight's thrill, the magical kiss, the frog prince..), or from new folk stories (Ghostbusters, Mission Impossible, Matrix..)-it managed to be an original fun fare on all the levels; as a parody, a satire, and a lovely story about love.I didn't like the recording of the voices. It was pretty obvious, especially at the first act, that the whole cast just dictate their lines separately, then somehow that have been gathered. The warmth of the actors being apposite each others is totally lost. Sometimes the scene's dialogue is short amputated sentences coming from one actor to not meet their opposite's passion.Another shortcoming which's the design of the characters. They are so ""Live"" to provocative extent. I think the history will say someday that at the first age of the CGI, the graphic movies.. whatever the name is, there was an affection for mimicking the human image and motion, to a perfect extent. It's a healthy affection, but I didn't like it in here, being unfunny and a sullen factor among the sweet faces and reactions of Shrek and Donkey.Add to that, some of what seemed as misplaced stuff such as seeing Puss while parodying Jennifer Beals from (Flashdance - 1983), Shrek's farting?? This is like being rude for rudeness!, using Julie Andrews's name more than Julie Andrews's acting talent or singing talent, or modeling the queen's face, even if accidentally, a la Carmen Elektra's which wasn't comfortable to tell you the truth!Aside from good original details, like the middle ages' meal, there are other beautiful ones that deal, or rather play, with the old stories' legacy brilliantly, reusing it in new originality such as: The bar of the stories' misfit characters. Refusing the ""show"" of transforming the princess, a la Cinderella, into someone else herself by wicked powers and for ill-intentioned purposes. Discovering that the king is basically a frog (so how to disapprove Shrek?!); therefore he remembers well his first kiss! And most of all: the talking mirror, from Snow White, in the city's TV; that could mean whether that that truthfulness' figure is now working as just an intermission voice on TV, or that the TV viewers will be as mad as Snow White's stepmother!The third act has the movie's best sequences and dynamic center. The parallel editing where we watch the hero's attempts to save his love in the nick of time, and the dance of the heroine with the hero's opponent-was super, let alone how the new arrangement of Bonny Taylor's I Need a Hero expressed the situation but roused it. It's a Hollywood big finish, comes in a way that makes you ask; how many times did cinema barrow from legends, folk stories, novels, etc? Anyhow, this movie exploits this fact enjoyably.Shrek 2 does the hardest; it's a sequel better than its original, and it's amusing as well as satiric. So for me, it's ""original"" with all the glorious meanings of the word.Finally, ""Sir Justin""?! OH GOD, that's a good one, a very good indeed!",Shrek 2
47,freemantle_uk,Just as good as the first,9,30 May 2008,"Shrek 2 is a very entertaining sequel and a good family film. This film follows Shrek and Fiona who had just came back from there honeymoon and Fiona's parents, the King and Queen of Far Far Away (get the joke) invite them to visit the kingdom. Unfortunately they don't know that Fiona was turned into a ogre, and not back into her human form. Fiona's dad was shocked, wanting Fiona to marry Prince Charming (this was hinted at in the first film), and admits to have Shrek assassinated by Puss-in-Boots. Shrek then tries to make himself into the man Fiona wants and at the same time Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother plot to get Fiona to fall in love with Prince Charming.This film works on many levels, it has a decent story and makes fun and uses many aspects of famous fairy tales. The Fairy Godmother is the main villain in this film which is a good twist. The film also parodies many things that could appeal to adults, such as an Alien parody, and there are more general references to films like Lord of the Rings, Mission Impossible and Indiana Jones. There are also cultural references such as Starbucks and a parody of Hollywood. There is a good supporting cast to the film. I liked Antonio Banderas as Puss-in-Boots, Julie Andrews, John Cleese and Rupert Everett. I also thought that it was a very good move to cast Jennifer Saunders as the Fairy Godmother. In the British version we got Jonathan Ross and Kate Thornton in the film which I thought was pretty fun. The animation of the film is top-notch and is possibly the best around. It is the most realistic in style and some of the little details are really good, such as seeing the freckles on Fiona's face. The also has fun little Easter Eggs and need to watch the film again to notice them, such as in the beginning of the film the Big Bad Wolf was reading a 'Pork Illustrated' magazine. I enjoyed the creation of Puss-in-Boots as a character and thought he was great. A little sidenote was that he looked liked my cat who was a young kitten at the time and thought it was a fun coincidence. My only problem of the film was the occasional fart joke, but it is aimed for children, so I can understand why they done it.Shrek 2 is a very good, but it was a shame that the third on was no where need as good.",Shrek 2
48,dfranzen70,More Shrekervescence!,9,8 November 2004,"I know what you're expecting me to say. ""If you liked Shrek ..."" And it's so true. Fans of the first will be ga-ga over the second. The gang at Dreamworks was smart enough not to monkey around with a winning formula, so you have all the wit and charm of Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy), and all the fantastic fairy-tale creatures.At the beginning of 2, Shrek and Fiona have been invited by Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) to the family castle. Imagine their surprise when the honeymooning ogres show up! Seems the king and queen haven't heard that a) Fiona's an ogre and b) that her husband is one, too. Naturally, this doesn't sit particularly well with the king, and soon he's hired a hit man - Puss in Boots, no less, voiced by Antonio Banderas - to bump off his new son in law. Meanwhile, a Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) offers help to Fiona. And quickly, the main question of the film - conveniently, it was the main question of the first film - is whether love conquers all. Oh, perhaps it's a bit more complex than that - perhaps it's whether Fiona would love Shrek, no matter what he looked like. Come to think of it, that was the theme of the first one as well. Shrek and Fiona journey to the land of Far, Far Away, where the stuffy king and the queen mum live. Far, Far Away is a clear knockoff of Hollywood itself (complete with the sign on the mountain), and the journey includes a pass through what looks like Beverly Hills. The attention to detail is marvelous, as always.As with 1, 2 drops all sorts of Disney references, most resulting in full-out belly laughter. I was in stitches, although perhaps - just perhaps - some of the humor will zoom over your tiny tot's tiny head.Shrek 2 is a beautifully done movie, perhaps even more entertaining than the original. Sure, at the end you know your emotions have been manipulated somewhat, but in the end you really don't care. Outstanding voice performances, flawless animation, and a crisp, moderately adult (but not mature, definitely not mature) script reign supreme.",Shrek 2
49,runamokprods,"Doesn't quite match the original, but still very good",8,14 May 2010,"A lot of fun, with good new characters voiced by John Cleese and Antonio Banderas. It just doesn't have quite the magic of the first film. But of course that's to be expected - part of what made the first so amazing was the wonderful world they created. Now that the world is familiar, it's hard to keep that same 'lightning in a bottle' enchantment. Still, way better than most sequels, and worth seeing if you enjoyed the original. On DVD - try to see the widescreen version. With animation this nice and detailed it's a shame to lose big chunks of the image.",Shrek 2
50,GiraffeDoor,A sequel fit for an Ogre.,9,25 November 2019,"Shrek 2 is the perfect sequel experience.It works partly because it answers all the questions raised by Shrek 1. it also uses for its premise the very complications and implications that would arise from the conclusions that the first movie gave us.The first movie was about a hard edged individual marginalized by a prejudiced society rediscovering his own capacity for tenderness and beating some stereotypes in the process.Now we have the same character desperately trying to aspire to these new pressures placed upon him and worrying he cannot quite measure up without help from a magical source.Some people felt this movie sacrificed heart in favour of pop-culture gags but I feel this is solid story telling. Shrek 1 (as much as I love it) loses a lot of momentum in the middle, after they've saved Fiona. But here it's a none stop adventure across physical land and the self (mentally AND physically) with all the anarchic humour and epic fight scenes that made us love the original.One might have thought they were jumping the shark with Puss, but he supplements the action brilliantly, complimenting rather than eclipsing the impeccable chemistry between Shrek and Donkey even if he is really just there for comic relief and with no real substance but then again I suppose his own story really ended with his own prequel spin-off. It's funny because an ogre was the antagonist in Puss's original story... XDThe fairy Godmother makes a delicious villain and J. Walters could not be more impacting as the darker side of class, again, subverting the classical fairy tale with a fresh panache. Prince Charming too could not have been better characterized. It could have came across as a little homophobic but they judged it just right.The peripheral cast is all there and used to great effect before we all got sick of them.The textures, the command of music original or otherwise, the plotting and the sheer razzle dazzle of the whole thing makes this a wonderful picture to enjoy again and again no matter what age you are. Its existence is truly justified and the only thing about it I'd object to is its use of lavatorial humour which i'm a buit sensitive about.But in conclusion, if you're going to see one animated sequel ever you could do little better than this.",Shrek 2
51,MaxBorg89,Fairy tales Episode II : Return of the Ogre,9,7 December 2005,"Remember Shrek, the ogre (voiced by Mike Myers) whose hilarious adventures were told in the eponymous animated film from 2001, a quite adult, politically incorrect cartoon? Well, he's back and he's more incorrect than ever! In the previous movie, we left our hero living happily ever after with his ""beautiful"" wife, Fiona (Cameron Diaz). Now, the issues begin, as the couple has to go to the kingdom of Far Far Away so Shrek can meet the in-laws (John Cleese and Julie Andrews). Sound familiar? Yeah, you've probably seen the same story in other movies, but it still makes people laugh for hours. Anyway, there's also another problem: the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders), who would rather see Fiona alongside her son, the narcissistic (and perhaps a bit gay) Prince Charming (Rupert Everett)...This sequel is much better than the original, with an intriguing story, ace gags (mostly involving Disney features) and tons of movie references (including Alien, Spider-Man, The Lord of the Rings and Mission:Impossible). But let's not forget the characters: like in the first film, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) steals the show, constantly talking and talking and talking (Shrek:""Donkey, you HAVE the right to remain silent! What you lack is the capacity!""). But there's a new entry that basically overshadows him: Puss In Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas (who deliberately spoofs his old character Zorro). Cute but lethal, he's practically the best thing in the movie.Smart, funny and moving, this is a sequel both kids and (most of all) adults will enjoy over and over again...",Shrek 2
52,MissSimonetta,One of Dreamworks' best to date,8,2 June 2014,"I love Shrek 2 now just as much as I did when I was a kid. Much superior to the first entry in the franchise in both comedy and heart (let's pretend the third film never happened), this is possibly the funniest Dreamworks movie at the present. I've seen it dozens of times in the past ten years since it was released and it never gets old, even though I know most of the dialogue by heart at this point.To be honest, this movie does have a few drawbacks for me personally. The use of pop music in the background proves distracting and cheap at times. Some of the pop culture references will no doubt date. The human characters look vaguely uncanny and occasionally downright ugly, even ones who are meant to be attractive. Then again, the Shrek series was never about looking super appealing in the classic Disney vein, and that suits the film's irreverent universe.Still, I adore this film and it always makes me laugh. Whether you have kids or not, this is good stuff for an evening viewing or if you just need a laugh.",Shrek 2
53,davispittman,Not nearly as good as the original Shrek In my opinion,5,2 October 2015,"Shrek 2 (2004) wasn't awful, although it most definitely was not nearly as good as the classic Shrek. My favorite part and favorite character from Shrek 2 was the fairy godmother voiced by Jennifer Saunders, who plays the main villain in the movie, her character was wonderfully constructed and wonderfully voiced by Mrs. Saunders. Charming was voiced well by Rupert Everett, and I enjoyed his character. But for me, Shrek 2 just didn't live up to my expectations based on the 1st Shrek. The animation and effects were good, but I felt like the execution of the plot was a little weak, and the movie as a whole just wasn't as enjoyable as the original classic Shrek that almost of America fell in love with. I know that a lot of critics fell just as much in love with this movie as the original Shrek, but it just didn't work for me.",Shrek 2
54,slokes,"Okay Followup, But Why?",6,21 November 2004,"There's plenty to delight the eye in ""Shrek 2,"" a solid, amiable outing with some amazing graphic sequences that must even make the folks at Pixar jealous. But the finding-the-beauty-within-ugliness formula is starting to run thin, and the makers seem in danger of taking their creations too seriously.Is it just me who feels annoyed by a kids' movie really geared to adults? I'm sure your typical eight-year-old is all over the subplot of in-law strife. The in-jokes and movie references are getting more obscure. I mean, even ""The Simpsons"" don't riff on Shirley Bassey.The storyline here is more of the same. Shrek had his hands full in the first film dealing with how people misinterpreted him. Now he has the same problem with his new wife Fiona's mother and father. Given they locked her away in a tower after she reached puberty, never to be seen again, you'd think they'd not be trying to micromanage their child's affections, but it is a cartoon.The fact is the filmmakers seem to think this isn't a cartoon at times, filling the screen with long bits where the characters, once apart, gaze silently into space while some pop drivel comes over the speakers. This is supposed to be meaningful, in case you haven't seen an episode of ""Friends,"" but it's not funny, and it slows up the action.Even when the focus turns to amusement, it's a kind of half-run thing. Take Puss In Boots, the fresh new breakout character of this film. He's funny for about five minutes, but as a would-be adversary, he's over with way too quickly, and then he just kind of hangs around the corners of the frame.I don't want to bash too hard, because the film does work more than it doesn't. I didn't flip over it, but maybe that's because it's kind of a date film I went to see with Mom. I did enjoy parts of it, when the manipulation didn't seem too intense. And it may be the best-looking animation you ever see on video. But it's a significant step down from the first film.",Shrek 2
55,Enchorde,"Great and witty, fun for the whole family",9,15 December 2004,"** Yupp, here be spoilers alright **Well, last we checked Shrek (Myers) got his princess Fiona (Diaz) and in this sequel they're back! Off to a honeymoon trip, and then they're invited to Fiona's parents. Shrek is hesitant, but Fiona makes sure they go. The parents, King (Cleese) and Queen (Andrews) don't quite expect two ogres to turn up however, and the family reunion is awkward, to put it mildly. And it won't get better when Fiona's Fairy Godmother (Saunders) secretly wants to pair up her own son Charming (Everett) with Fiona, so that her son becomes king (eventually). And there are some clandestine deal between the Fairy Godmother and the King, which actually leads the King to hire a hit-man, or hitcat (Puss in Boots (Banderas)) at least, to take Shrek out. Not the best way to create family happiness. Shrek and Fiona, mostly Shrek in this movies point of view, must fight to keep their love alive.This is a great movie that anybody, young or old, might enjoy. For the young, a great animated adventure with a lot of familiar characters from fairy tales and stories. For the older audience, there is a great humor and an awful lot of terrific funny references to other movies, series and such. Actually, this is one of the best spoof/parody movies I ever seen. The story is good, but not great. It seems like a lot of the story is written just to cram as much references as possible into it. As it is masterfully done, I can see no fault in that however, but the story itself is not what one remembers from the movie. However, I suspect it is good enough for the younger audience to be happy and not lose interest. The cast and characters are great. Myers reprise his role as Shrek brilliantly, Diaz is great as Fiona once again, Murphy is awesome as Donkey. Cleese, Saunders, Everett and Andrews are good additions, but especially Banderas (perfectly casted) is great as the wonderful character Puss in Boots.Well, was there more to say? Good humor, greats spoofs, brilliant characters and cast. Ah, throw in good animation as well and you have a totally great funny movie. Go see!9/10",Shrek 2
56,aidanratesmovies,Shrek 2 made me a believer...in good sequels,9,31 May 2021,"Just shy as being as good as the first film, Shrek 2 easily proves itself as a terrific animated sequel by delivering more strongly on its romantic premise and introducing many fun new characters. The main flaw I have with this film is the first 15 minutes or so of the film, pretty much the time before we get into the main plot and meet Puss in Boots. The beginning of the film just feels like it's dragging to check all the little boxes of things from the first film, but there doesn't seem to be as much enjoyment in it as before. I was pleased to see it was only for the beginning of the film though, and certainly not for the rest. It's full of colorful animation, many funny visual gags, and iconic 2000's references- it's just a joy to watch- and with a little more effort at the forefront of the film- it could have easily been a step up from the original- but instead, it's almost as good, which I'm perfectly content with. The film features an expansion on its much talented cast from the first film, the standouts being largely Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots (easily the funniest part of the film alongside Eddie Murphy's iconic Donkey), John Cleese as the King, and Jennifer Saunders as the fairy godmother. We also see the fun return of fairy tale characters Pinocchio and Gingy- who may not be in the film for long- but easily make their mark in the scheme of things. The cinematography is a grand improvement over the original, with its animation being about the same level of quality- if not a little worse. By far what makes the film so magical though is its expansion of the story at hand- they could have easily delivered another cash grab filled sequel like many animation studios do- but this sequel is absolutely full of heart and romance- that you will truly be moved by its end.My Rating: 9.4/10.",Shrek 2
57,Jonny_Numb,pale shadow of the original,4,7 October 2005,"The original ""Shrek"" was an absolutely charming fairy tale that skillfully accentuated a simple message with impassioned performances and gallows humor. ""Shrek 2,"" however, fails in many departments, but no more than the most crucial: it is completely lacking the fairytale charm and wonder that made its predecessor so darn endearing. This time around, the characters seem to be just going through the motions of what is, at heart, a formula sequel propped up with glitzy computer animation that is at least as good as the original's. A collection of charmless new characters does little to help the cause, which is made increasingly futile with a tone-deaf sense of satire and a self-conscious, anvil-heavy humor that seldom permits any genuine laughs. Unfortunately, this sequellike so many otherswas clearly driven by a committee of producers rather than fresh ideas.",Shrek 2

Shrek 2 is a colloge of wit, fun, colorful imagery and jam packed with adventure, hilarity movie and character tributes-it packs the same delicious punch as the first one.The main characters are back with a vengeance and this time there are quite a few new ones as well-I'm not gonna get into reviewing the story which 90 percent or more know anyway, or giving away any of the funnier lines to the 10 percent or less who may not yet have seen it-what I will say is it's highly unlikely one who loves Shrek 1 will walk away disappointed.Special kudos to Puss and boots-played by Antonio Banderes in a fantastic performance-also additional kudos to the, never fails to be hilarious, gingerbread boy who, as in the first Shrek, quietly provides the finishing touches of pure hilarity-he was one of my favorites in the first installment and I was quite pleased he was brought back in the second.If I had one thing I was a bit disappointed by, it is (SPOILER) that Dragon wasn't brought back as a main character-it would have been hilarious to see a love struck donkey-I was surprised about that.Most of the really hilarious stuff-the fall down in your seat hilarity, takes place in the second half of the movie-during the first half your just glad to see all your favorites together again on screen.It is never dull and always entertains-I look forward to Shrek 3-I never thought I'd be a fan of animated pictures but Shrek has made me a believer! Good job to all-8 of 10.",Shrek 2

62,rosscinema,Inside jokes galore!,7,9 July 2004,"While the first film showcased characters and events that seemed new to us this sequel is definitely more familiar with dozens of modern references to make the most stoic of critics chuckle. Story picks up from the first film where we see newly married Shrek (Mike Myers) and his ogre wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) receiving a summons from her parents to come back home but they don't know that she was turned into an ogre. Shrek and Fiona along with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) head to the kingdom that Fiona's parents King Harold (John Cleese) and Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews) rule and when they get there everyone is in shock. *****SPOILER ALERT*****While staying at the palace King Harold and a conniving Fairy Godmother Dama Fortuna (Jennifer Saunders) try and convince Fiona to leave Shrek and marry Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) but when this fails they hire an assassin cat named Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) but that doesn't work either and Puss travels along with him as his friend. Shrek drinks a potion that changes he and Fiona and Donkey into good looking normal beings but it must be certified by a kiss by midnight or else they will change back.This film is directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon who altogether make this a very funny and entertaining sequel and the question comes up about whether this is better than the original. I'm not sure if it is but I do think it's funnier and there are more in-jokes in this film that it would be impossible to catch them all after only one viewing. One example is a photo in Fiona's bedroom of Lord Justin which is a reference to Justin Timberlake that Cameron Diaz is dating in real life. One thing stands out and it's Shrek himself in that his behavior and manners are different from the first film. Here he seems more domesticated and (Dare I say it?) normal. But I guess that can be explained by the fact that he's in love and marriage will change a man..er..ogre. I don't really think this effort approaches the greatness of ""Finding Nemo"" in terms of detailed animation and even in the basic story but this is still an extremely enjoyable film that is chock full of humor.",Shrek 2
63,invisibleunicornninja,Pretty bad.,6,29 March 2018,"The best thing to come from these movies is the memes, and that's not saying much. The animation in this thing is terrible, and the plot is boring. The characters are dumb. Some scenes are funny, but not enough to make this thing worth watching.",Shrek 2
64,Rob_Taylor,A decent sequel.,8,3 June 2004,"Sequels tend often to be ""more of the same"" that you saw in the original. Usually this isn't a particularly good thing, but here in Shrek 2 it's harmless enough fun.Essentially the story evolves into a ""save the wife from the evil sorceress' machinations"" deal. The voice acting is good and, much like before, most of the humour comes from Donkey, although he is ably assisted his time round by a new character, Puss (Banderas), who others have rightly said nearly steals the movie.There are lots of references to other fairy tales, of course, and lots of bit-part appearances by characters from such tales. Also present, we have fond rip-offs of such movies as ET and Ghostbusters, to name but a few.All in all it's harmless, entertaining fun and not to be taken too seriously. If there's any moral message to the film then it's probably the same as the first film, namely being who you are, not who others want you to be.A good enough way to spend some time without having to think about anything much.",Shrek 2
65,moviewizguy,A Worthy Sequel!,9,24 May 2007,"Right after their honeymoon the newly wed couple goes to Princess Fiona's parents for dinner. When a Fairy God Mother discovers Fiona and Shrek are married she reminds the king about a deal they agreed on years ago that Fiona should have married Prince Charming (her son). The king then hires a cat named Puss-in-Boots (a sword fighting cat and ogre slayer) to kill Shrek.The first was such a great film, this sequel obviously fell short. Of course it was unnecessary but it's still a great film! It's the best animation film of 2004, although it didn't win the Oscar. As you can see, this film is bigger, funner, and funnier!Trust me, there are more jokes in this than in any animated film. I've watched this with a full audience which laughed throughout the movie! Also, you can find some great action sequences and many spoofs to other films.There are lovable characters in this film, including the new Puss and Boots. There is a great story and moral in this film and so on in a great animation flick. Although not better than the first, it's still a great fantastic movie!",Shrek 2
66,Lady_Targaryen,This second movie is very GOOD,9,16 November 2005,"I imagined this film to be a crap, because it is almost a rule with few exceptions,that second movies are always terrible in comparison with the first ones. But not this one. I cannot say that I liked Shrek2 more then the first, but the second one is very good too: New characters as the Fairy Godmother,Prince Charming,Puss In Boots and Fiona's parents are introduced to us, and a new reality comes, with Shrek and Fiona's relationship going to a deeper step,and new confusions because of their wedding.One of the good surprises, was that neither Shrek or Fiona changed to the human form;I was almost sure that they would,but I think that the movie would loose its magic. By the way: The voice of the new characters really rules! But Julie Andrews, John Cleese and Rupert Everett only could do a great job.:) I liked Antonio Bandeiras as Puss In Boots as well!

I had always some doubts and that's why I hesitated but after thirty minutes I had enough because there was no logic, the script was awful and the soundtrack totally misplaced. I really couldn't follow the story and I don't know how this animation got such high ratings and audience or did I see a completely other film? I give it not more than 3/10. See instead the more interesting ones as FINDING NEMO, MADAGASCAR, POLAR EXPRESS or ICE AGE I and II.

And here once more some myths and values are upside down with the ogre being again the good one and the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming the wicked ones. A great portion of good humour is added to the story with some very hilarious gags and wink giving at some of our consumers' society values such as TV and pop music shows. The images and sceneries are almost perfect in terms of animations and the characters are very expressive in their bodily and face movements. But the main feature of the movie is perhaps that against the grain of the usual values in child stories that identify beauty with kindness and ugliness with wickedness, it shows the viewers mainly the children, that these realities don't necessarily go together. Unfortunately I cannot say anything about the voices of great movie stars lent to the characters because I have seen a Portuguese version with Portuguese actors' voices who made an excellent dubbing anyway.",Shrek 2

The freshness of the first film has gone, but that is not to say that this sequel is stale, far from it! It still has plenty of new gags and parody's, and it successfully plays on a few 'in jokes' from Shrek's first outing.The only problem i can see here, is this, the magic has worn off a little, (despite the introduction of the fairy god-mother) and it does leave the movie just a shade behind the original.A Good sequel, and i can't wait for Shrek 3, but i suspect it may disappoint (lets hope not) 7/10",Shrek 2

73,Sirus_the_Virus,"Not quite as good as the original, but still really good.",9,20 August 2009,"Shrek 2 was one of the better sequels of 2004. I will give my list at towards the end of my review. I absolutely loved the original Shrek film. The first film was highly inventive, incredibly funny and clever. The second film is almost the same, but you don't get as much from some the characters that you loved. Donkey isn't Donkey in this film, he turns into a stallion. Shrek isn't Shrek anymore, he turns into a human. The second film is very funny may not be the weakest in the series. It's a lot better than Shrek the third, which wasn't bad either. It just lacked what the first two films had. Shrek 2, as I said earlier, was one of the best sequels of 2004. The best sequels of 2004 were:5.Meet the Fockers4.Shrek 23. Kill Bill Volume 22. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban1.Spider-man 2So perhaps Shrek 2 wasn't the best sequel of 2004. But it still has the creativity and humor that the first film had. The film also has new cast members including Julie Andrews, Antonio Banderas, John Cleese, Rupert Everett, Jennifer Saunders, and for some reason I think there are more people than that. though that's a great enough cast. Shrek 2 may not be as good as the original, but it's still a great film. One of the rare animated sequels that isn't far from the original. Shrek 2 is a good sequel and a good animated film. It was actually nominated for best animated picture in 2005. I personally think it deserved it.The Plot: In the sequel to the smash hit Shrek, Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey set off to Far, Far away to visit Fiona's parents. Fiona's father isn't alright with her being with an ogre, so he tries to find a way to get rid of him. Fiona's fairy godmother is trying to get rid of him also so then her son can become king someday.",Shrek 2

75,TheUnknown837-1,"a sequel that measures up to and, depending on one's point of view, is better than the original",10,21 July 2007,"If you were to meet me on the street and ask me which film I liked better: ""Shrek"" or ""Shrek 2"", I might pause for a moment and think it over and then answer that the latter of the two choices was my personal favorite. It is very rare for a sequel to beat the original, and to most people, ""Shrek 2"" does NOT beat the original, but is an acceptable film to stand second-in-line in the franchise. Maybe it is not as original as the first Shrek, but I personally prefer the more realistic humor and more fitting styles seen in ""Shrek 2"". Don't get me wrong, the first ""Shrek"" was an amazing film and one of my favorite animated films and there was absolutely nothing unfitting about it.""Shrek 2"" brings back our favorite cast of computer-animated characters with the voices of popular comedians such as Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy. Shrek the big green ogre, Donkey the donkey, Fiona the princess-turned-ogre, and of course the cast of fairy tale classic favorites like Pinocchio, the Three Pigs, the Gingerbread Man, etc. Like the first film, the animation in the film is so flawless and the voice acting has no faults in it to allow us to be absorbed by the combination of performances and talents and accept the characters as characters, but imaginary things with somebody's words syncing alongside.The screenplay and storyline for ""Shrek 2"" does the first ""Shrek"" justice, as it furtherly opens up and expands this imaginary, fairy tale world. The characters, whom we already know and understand very well, are given fantastic traits of development and the humor which comes from their actions and thoughts are in a way, entirely realistic. Not by the perfection of the animation or the voice acting, but just by the way its written. And characters here also are stretching out with emotions that in the first film, were not exploited for the plot constraints of that film. This is what I like to see in sequels: characters who return and are expanded. Not just standing in the background. If ""Shrek 2"" had been made with live-action actors and shot on a set, it would also have worked out fine. Even if the ogres were not ogres, the donkeys weren't donkeys, the cats weren't cats, and the fairy tale creatures weren't fairy tale creatures.Yes, I might stand in a smaller crowd when I say that ""Shrek 2"" is better than the first ""Shrek"". But I want to remind readers that I think it beats the original only by a sliver. The first ""Shrek"" was wonderful and the second is only a tad bit better. It just opens up and expands wonderfully and is of no disappointment to me.",Shrek 2
76,mstomaso,Respectable effort with a tough act to follow,7,23 April 2005,"Shrek 2 has as much humor, talent, and fun as the original classic, and almost as much heart. The film picks up where Shrek left off, with Fiona and Shrek celebrating their marriage, but they are immediately cast into a new adventure when summoned to the land of Far Far Away (a clever parody of Hollywood), to the court of Fiona's mother and father, for a surprise royal wedding ball. The only problem, as it turns out, is that Fiona has married the wrong guy - according to everybody but Shrek, Fiona, and their friends.The plot, revolving around this central problem, is helped along by nearly constant allusions to virtually every fairy tale in the English canon, and satirical references to many recent popular films. Unsatisfied with the combination of romantic comedy, Hollywood satire and self-parody, the film-makers' also went all out with a clever original soundtrack, making Shrek 2 as much of a musical as anything else.The voice talent is just as essential as it was in the first film, and there's more of it, with John Cleese and Antonio Banderas giving very memorable performances. And the animation is, unsurprisingly, lovely.To their credit, Dreamworks kept the core talent in place, but created a somewhat different formula for this film. Even though I expect most fans of the first film to adore the second, I am not sure Shrek 2 is going to make the franchise any new fans. Though more clearly made for adult audiences than the original, Shrek 2 is still warm-hearted family fare. As much as I DO recommend this film, and as entertaining as I think it will be for just about anybody, I don't consider Shrek 2 to be quite the classic Shrek was. It's touching and goofy, to be sure, but it's much more of a Hollywood film than the original, and it doesn't quite reach the same levels. Nevertheless, it is one of the better sequels I have seen, and it was definitely worth both the price of admission and a third or fourth viewing of the DVD.",Shrek 2
77,NijazBaBs,even better than 1st sequel,10,6 January 2021,"This is perfect, it looked so 15 years ago, and it does so now. Emotional, adventuristic, almost real (more real than cartoon), and funny. There are perfect graphics, magic, tricks, characters. All fairytales mentioned in this one. Creative, surprising, and lots of irony and jokes. Comparable to some of best cartoons and animated movies like Maleficent, Ice Age, Finding Nemo, Stuart Little... Looks like some dream, almost real, like possible reality. Best part are various characters which even just by existence are interesting to watch, not to mention because of funny behavior. And I wanted to say the only character I missed from 1st sequel is the dragon, but looks like I was wrong.",Shrek 2
78,IonicBreezeMachine,"Shrek returns without the novelty of its predecessor, but builds upon what worked.",7,18 August 2021,"Following their return from their honeymoon, ogres Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are welcomed back to their swamp home by Donkey (Eddie Murphy). While Shrek is set on enjoying swamp life and married life with his new bride, a messenger from the kingdom of Far Far Away from Fiona's parents Harold (John Cleese) and Lillian (Julie Andrews) invites them for a celebration of their union with Shrek less than enthused about the meeting. Once there Fiona's parents are taken aback by Fiona's new appearance and husband, with Harold in particular barely concealing his anger. The situation puts a strain on Fiona and Shrek's relationship, with the villainous Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) using this as a way to steer Fiona towards her vain preening son Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) with the help of Harold who owes a massive debt that demands repayment.After the smash hit of the first Shrek, a sequel was greenlit to capitalize on the success with all of the cast returning. The story development was contentious behind the scenes with the initial writing team of Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio wanting to keep the film's fairy tale setting grounded which was at odds with the wishes of the producers who wanted more contemporary humor forcing them to drop out and write Pirates of the Caribbean. Eventually the film settled on a story structure inspired by the 1967 Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, and setting it in a setting that based itself on and satirized the superficiality of Hollywood and associated celebrity lifestyles and cultures. While on a story level Shrek 2 doesn't resonate as strongly as its predecessor, it is a very funny and charming comedy that keeps the humor fast and the dialogue sharp.Unlike many comedy sequels, Shrek 2 doesn't hit the reset button and it continues the story almost on point from where the first film ended. Shrek and Fiona are now married, but with the marriage comes the issue of changing lifestyles and of course Shrek reconciling his own life with the life Fiona had before she met him. Both Fiona and Shrek have their own personal weight they bring to the relationship and the movie is sincere in its attempts to show the challenge in addressing that dynamic in a marriage. With that said, the setup with the parent(s) who dislikes the love interest's suitor has been done since The Honeymooners and Flintstones and it does threaten to make the film a bit more ""sitcomy"" than I think it wanted. The story isn't the primary reason to watch this movie however, and instead it's the characters and humor that make this movie work.The movie expands its cast incredibly well giving us new additions while building upon the current stable of characters. Jennifer Saunders is our villain in the Fairy Godmother this time around, and she is a massive upgrade on Farquaad from the first film. Saunders plays the character like a mixture of Mr. Burns and an insane wedding planning and her doting on her spoiled arrogant son Prince Charming well played by Rupert Everett makes them some truly enjoyable villains. But the true breakout is Antonio Banderas playing Puss in Boots who satirizes his Zorro persona with energy and charisma to spare and the design work of Puss with making him so over the top adorable is put to good comedic effect.Shrek 2 doesn't have the weight the first film brought, but it is still enjoyable thanks to strong comic energy, engaged performances, and pacing and creativity that keep the comedy coming. While I not groundbreaking like its predecessor, it's a fun fractured fairy tale sitcom that will give you several belly laughs and chuckles.",Shrek 2
79,emasterslake,Great laughs Great sequel.,8,2 June 2007,"Takes place right after the first installment. A prince named Charming traveled across the vast land to rescue Fiona from the inferno tower. Only to discover that someone else got there before him. And currently Fiona and Shrek are enjoying their honeymoon together. After they spend sometime together, they both went back to the swamp where they got a message from a messenger that Fiona's parents would love to see her and her husband(who they presume is Prince Charming). Shrek doesn't want to go while Fiona insists that Shrek needs to at least meet her parents if he wants to be part of the family.After a long argument short, they packed up for their trip to the kingdom of ""Far Far Away"". It was a long trip specially with Donkey annoying them on when they're there yet. Once they do get there, Fiona's parents are in for a surprise to find out that their daughter married an ogre instead of Prince Charming. It all comes down to Shrek who now wonders if things be better if Fiona married someone else.Like the first one, it has the humor, fairy tales, in jokes, & copyrighted songs to make it an enjoyable feature. I remember this one being a huge hit when it came out back in 2004. And there's no comparison for it in being part f the best sequel group. It also introduces the Puss n Boots character, who is loved by millions of fans, and the very reason why it made this movie memorable.So those who liked Shrek Original will like the sequel as well.",Shrek 2
80,Beta_Gallinger,"Another impressive piece of computer animation, like the original",8,5 October 2008,"After seeing the original ""Shrek"" on the small screen, probably more than once, I went to see this sequel on the big screen in 2004, I think with much anticipation, and was impressed, just like I was with the first one. I saw ""Shrek 2"" again on the small screen once at some point within the next year, and it was still enjoyable. Like most sequels, this one is generally considered inferior to its predecessor, but I'm not sure which one I preferred. I recently watched both of them again, and I don't think I was quite as impressed with the first one as I used to be, and it may have been the same case with this sequel, but they were still both good.After a long journey, Prince Charming makes it to the dragon's castle, where he expects to find Princess Fiona and rescue her. However, soon after he gets there, he discovers the Princess isn't there, and learns that she's on her honeymoon! Yes, she is now married to Shrek, and has taken the form of an ogress. Shortly after the newly wed couple return to the swamp, they receive an invitation from the King and Queen of Far, Far Away, Fiona's parents, to a Royal Ball in the kingdom, where Shrek is to receive a blessing from the King. The couple set out with Donkey to the kingdom, and the King and Queen are obviously surprised to see their daughter with an ogre and looking a lot like him. Fiona's mother is easygoing about this, but her father is not happy about the fact that she hasn't married Prince Charming as planned, and he and Shrek have trouble getting along. Not only that, Prince Charming and his mother, the Fairy Godmother, are both determined to get Princess Fiona away from Shrek and with the Prince!This sequel takes us to new places we didn't see in the original, including, of course, the Kingdom of Far, Far Away, which I think I've found to be more interesting than, let's say, the Kingdom of Duloc in the original. ""Shrek 2"" also features more characters, including Prince Charming, the King and Queen, the Fairy Godmother, and Puss In Boots. I can't complain much about any of these characters, and John Cleese of Monty Python fame was a great choice for the voice of the King. You can always recognise his voice if you've heard it enough. Just like the original, this sequel features laughs, amazing animation, excitement, and perhaps some touching scenes. The humour may not always work (for example, Shrek and Fiona farting during the honeymoon sequence), but I would say the humour usually succeeds. One of the really funny parts I found was Donkey on the way to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away, bored and unable to stop pestering Shrek and Fiona. Speaking of Donkey, I think I found him funnier here than in the original. This time, he doesn't seem to really overdo it with his yapping, or maybe just has funnier lines.I've rated this first sequel to DreamWorks Animation's 2001 smash hit 8/10, the same as its predecessor, but even though it's rated lower on this site, I think I like it better, for reasons I've mentioned above, and maybe more. It just might not be consistent enough for me to vote higher than an 8 (it may get a bit better as it goes along), but if not, it comes close. There are times when sequels receive more praise than their predecessors, and ""Shrek 2"" does not appear to be one of those, it appears to be like most of them, considered inferior by most. So, it looks like I can't join the majority on this one, but I'm definitely not the only one who likes it better than the original, and it's certainly not among the most poorly received movie sequels ever made (it seems it turned out to be a success, just like the original ""Shrek""). For that reason, if you're a fan of the original, you may or may not be disappointed by this sequel, but either way, I think it's worth a try.",Shrek 2
81,Stampsfightclub,Slightly corny but ultimately enjoyable,8,9 October 2008,"After receiving a note from her parents, Fiona, Shrek and Donkey head on a journey to Far Far Away where Shrek comes under the wrath of the King.Shrek 2 was one of the most anticipated and well received animated sequels in recent years and broke many records, and is easy to see why with fun characters, daft humour and a very strong likability factor.After winning an Oscar for the first, a sequel was always inevitable and though not as good as the first, this comedy still packs plenty of jokes in with the same and more lovable characters.Myers, Murphy, Diaz all return to their respective roles, and Antonio Banderas comes in for the very cool Puss in Boots. John Cleese as the King, Julie Andrews as the Queen and the star of the show is Jennifer Saunders as the wicked and sophisticated fairy god mother and despite the evilness of her character; you just have to love her. She is easily the funniest ever evil animated female and is worth watching just for her.Like the first, this film is very character driven with Shrek struggling to Fiona's lifestyle, and Fiona having trouble with her new husband and her family. By focusing upon emotions, the film engages the audience into its narrative and makes us associate with the characters and makes it realistic, despite a few clichés along the way.There is slightly more humour with this film, and once again all the fairytale creatures get parodied, along with some intertextuality from major Hollywood films including Lord of the Rings, Mission Impossible, Spider-man and Alien, all very accurate and humorous if you know what's going on.The plot is consistent in its approach to the occurring events and the direction helps achieve the humour and emotion. However what lets this sequel down is the writing. All the way through, the film runs on a few clichés, feeling very dull and unoriginal. The essence of predictability is always hanging around and can be very disappointing, especially with the just in time scenarios. Nevertheless the film is targeted towards a younger audience and with the easy to understand basics it does so in a healthy and respectable manner.The purpose is to entertain, and though corny, Shrek 2 achieves it's main objective.",Shrek 2
82,jon.h.ochiai,Ogres Ever After,10,13 June 2004,"""Shrek 2"" directed by Andrew Adamson (who also did Shrek), Kelly Asbury, and Conrad Vernon (the Gingerbread Man) continues the Ogre fairy tale after happily ever after as the couple, Shrek (Mike Meyers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz), visit the in-laws in Far Away Kingdom, the King (John Cleese) and Queen (Julie Andrews).  Shrek 2 is a great movie, almost as good as Shrek, and definitely funnier.  Shrek caught one by surprise the first time around, in that it was a satire of fairy tales, but underlying it was a very touching story about valuing people... and Ogres for their heart and character, in spite of appearance.  That unexpected quality can not be recreated; however, Shrek 2 has a touching quality, and the surprise quality of the first movie is replaced by hilarious pop culture digs, and the introduction of new characters, Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) and Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders).  Shrek was based on a book by William Steig, who co-wrote the screenplay for ""Shrek"".  Here in ""Shrek 2"", J. David Stein, Joe Stillman, and David N. Weiss wrote the story for the Big Green Guy. So this kind of explains the difference in tone, though the quality remains excellent.  Shrek and Fiona along with Donkey (the hilarious Eddie Murphy) travel to visit Fiona's parents in Far Away which looks amazing like Beverly Hills-- a great joke. The King and Queen meet their new Ogre-In-Law, Shrek, and much to their dismay their daughter too is now an ogre.  They both had such high aspirations for Fiona to marry Prince Charming (the wonderfully prissy Rupert Everett).  Apparently, Shrek beat out Charming in Shrek 1, by rescuing Fiona from the Dragon's castle first.  Charming's mother also happens to be the Fairy Godmother.  That is the ""evil"" Fairy Godmother, who schemes to have her son marry Fiona.  The King is particularly displeased with Shrek, and enlists the aid of Puss-In-Boots (Banderas), the Zorro-like kitty.  Shrek 2 moves a little slowly initially in the set up.  Once Puss In Boots joins Shrek and Donkey, and threatening Donkey's sidekick status the movie becomes a laugh riot.  The one constant amidst the gags and jokes is that Shrek loves Fiona and only wishes to make her happy.  This gives the movie it's heart.  The gags are laugh until you die funny.  This includes a satire of ""Cops"" called ""Knights"", a spoof of the Stay Puff Marshmellow Man from ""Ghost Busters"", and the numerous pokes at Disney.  In one scene Fairy Godmother tells our hero, Shrek, ""Snow White-- No ogres.  Cindrella-- No ogres... Pretty Woman-- No ogres!""  Antonio Banderas as Puss practically steals the movie, especially with his effective ""fighting technique"". Jennifer Saunders as Fairy Godmother is awesome as the evil and scheming fairy.  The returning Mike Meyers, Cameron Diaz, and Eddie Murphy reprising their voices to characters we know and love, are fabulous.  Diaz carries off the ""straight man"" Princess amazingly.  She definitely has a challenging role, given the comic genius of both Meyers and Murphy.  To his credit Meyers textures the gruff Shrek, with a surprising charm and sweetness.  Murphy as Donkey is always on the verge of being completely annoying and outrageous, but never crosses that threshold and remains always lovable.  The three actors are very comfortable voicing characters we have become very fond of. We look forward to seeing where their lives pick up in ""Shrek 3"".  Shrek 2 is a lot of fun, and the Ogres live happily ever after... at least for now.",Shrek 2
83,Hollywood_Yoda,Story Flows Better Than the First,9,3 November 2018,"The story really does have a flow that's better than that of the first film. This time around, Shrek and Fiona have just returned from their honeymoon after they were married in Shrek. Being that Fiona is a princess, her parents now want to meet her husband. This installment has a great back story to why Fiona was locked away in the first film.I enjoyed the cast voiceovers more than anything though, with Julie Andrews and John Cleese playing Fiona's parents, the king and queen of Far Far Away. And Far Far Away is supposed to be a kingdom, but looks a lot like Hollywood and Beverly Hills. The ending has a twist that, if you haven't seen the film, will really be unexpected.Shrek 2 is a fun sequel that's even better than the original, and that's unusual.",Shrek 2
84,fernandoschiavi,"More focused and bringing back dozens of references, more excitement, adventure, creativity, and especially a lot of comedy and lessons for the whole family",8,14 May 2021,"A continuation of the same level as the original, in fact I even think that is slightly higher than the original. Here again the directors Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon managed to maintain the characteristics of the original film and even more daring. In this film we see Shrek and Fiona after their honeymoon, they receive an invitation from her parents to receive the blessings of marriage before all the people of Far, Far Away. The problem is that they thought Fiona had married Prince Charming promised and not an ogre. Fiona convinces Shrek to visit them over Fiona's parents are surprised, especially King Harold, who had made a pact with the Fairy Godmother, marrying his daughter to her son (Prince Charming). It is then that King Harold hires Puss in Boots to separate the couple ogre.The dialogues and especially the jokes full of references are even more sharp and inspired. Several scenes priceless part of this movie, including: the scene where Donkey discovers that turned a beautiful sorrel, as well as the scene where he says he and Shrek are more ""sexy"", all scenes are incredible character Cookie , including Giant Cookie invading the castle, the scenes in which the principle Donkey becomes jealous of the new member of the troupe, Puss in Boots, all scenes that occurred within the factory potions Fairy Godmother, Pinocchio scene using a thong during the rescue in the cell in the best Mission Impossible style, and the scenes of Shrek as a human and more ""beautiful""). The duo Shrek and Donkey are even more hilarious and moreover has the Puss in Boots that also gives your special charm in your scenes.The film does have many scenes that cause laughter, jokes with sensational and with dramatic scenes at the right moments, like when Shrek imagines that it is not ideal for a princess, what would fit best to a prince indeed, and of course the scenes end when Shrek interrupts the dance engagement and the film's final revelations are made. The second chapter deals with the issue of very beautiful and ugly, reinforces once again that we should not judge people by their appearance and we like them for what they are and underline the importance of love and in his name the people who really love can and must change the partner (a) in their actions and attitudes.Love is put here as transformative and magical. These scenes of emotion were placed at the right time and critical of the film and are still packed the fabulous soundtrack once again Harry Gregson-Williams. We see everything here is much larger than the first. This film has more complex scenarios, far more human characters including multitudes with a degree of perfect modeling. Not to cite the issue of interaction of particles (water, fire, smoke, sun, etc.), facial expressions even more realistic than the perfect drive for specific particles such as hair, clothing etc. It is a work even more complex, whimsical and fabulous than the first, is the most elaborate synopsis and script, as for its technical achievement.Again we see numerous references in its soundtrack, which goes from the Accidentally In Love Counting Crows, Little Drop Of Poison by Tom Waits, Changes Butterfly Boucher and David Bowie, to Livin 'La Vida Loca played by Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas. Fleeing the musical sphere, we have once again the numerous and constant links with blockbusters such as the scene where Shrek accidentally instead of kissing Fiona, The Little Mermaid kisses during the honey-moon, who is a parody of the movie "" From Here to Eternity. "" Not to speak of the citation kiss upside down parodying the movie ""Spider-Man"", as well as sensational scene rescue Shrek, Donkey and Cat by Biscuit, Pinocchio, Lobo Mau and the Three Little Pigs from the cell where they were, also using the theme song from Mission Impossible. Besides the films, of course various characters of the Brothers Grimm and Disney are referenced all the time, like Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood in the scenes during the honey-moon, Snow White, especially in the scene of her falling asleep in the buggy prom wedding. And satirize gossip channels showing real engagement in the kingdom, including satirizing the logo like the gossip channel E! Entertainment. Not to talk about the signs of, Far Away, indicating that there was a Hollywood fairy tale.Anyway, once the work is much more focused and brings back dozens of references, more excitement, adventure, creativity, and especially a lot of comedy and lessons for the whole family. Must also turned and classic animation. Deserved Oscar nomination for best animation and deserved to have won. Wonderful and funny as the previous one.",Shrek 2
85,gregsrants,A classic,8,27 May 2004,"If admitting you were wrong makes you a bigger man, then by the end of this review I should be as big as an ogre. It all started when I miscalculated the popularity of the Shrek sequel and I showed up to the theatre a mere 20 minutes before show time. The first, second, third and fourth showings were sold out and I was now left with the option of purchasing a ticket for a film that was not starting for almost two hours.Reluctantly, I purchased a ticket and headed to the concession stand where I waited another 30 minutes before getting served (no complaints, I was in no hurry). So I sauntered to the theatre where screaming children and patient parents were in abundance. Now one hour plus before the start of the film, I was searching for a seat. My second mistake was thinking that Shrek 2 was going to follow the typical sequel rules and provide me with entertainment that would be just below the standard set by the first film. Rarely are sequels anything but drawn out attempts to try and recapture the energy and success of the first, and Hollywood has rarely seemed to figure this out. By the time Shrek 2 was over my faith had been restored (if only temporarily).Shrek 2 picks up where Shrek left off. Shrek and Fiona are now married and the movie commences with their honeymoon and an invitation back to Far Far Away Land to meet Fiona's parents. The only problem is that the king and queen think their daughter has been rescued by Prince Charming and not a green, rude, slob of an ogre. Their uncomfortability at the inaugural first meeting was reminiscent of many of my first dinners with previous dating partners' parents without the food stabbing or talking donkey. The movie then follows the king as he tries to scuttle the marriage and Shrek as he tries to atone for his behavior with his new bride. Shrek 2 does take longer to get its gears in motion than the first, but when Shrek, Donkey and Fiona hit Far Far Away Land, the movie picks up a frantic pace of pop culture references and movie spoofs that will leave your head spinning trying to keep up. Whether it is the city streets that don spoofs of The Gap and Burger King or the hilarious take of Mission Impossible 2 with Pinocchio as Tom Cruise, the film goes for the gusto and doesn't allow you to catch your breath before throwing you another 'where-do-I-know-that-from'.And if the first Shrek brought us a few familiar fairy tale characters like the Big Bad Wolf and Three Blind Mice, Shrek 2 sees that ante and raises it two-fold. Blink and you might not see the Wicked Witch at the Poison Apple Bar or The Little Mermaid being eaten by a shark. Each cartoon character will remind you of your bedtime stories as a child and you will leave the theatre with cheeks that hurt from the 90-minute grin on your face.My third and fourth mistakes were thinking that Eddie Murphy had lost his talent to be funny and that Shrek 2 could not replace the interesting evil Lord Farquaad of Duloc. Eddie has not made me laugh in more than 10 years and his with a filmography that includes The Adventures of Pluto Nash and I Spy, his agent should be shot and tossed overboard for securing deals for Mr. Murphy to star in such underachieving vehicles. Donkey (Murphy) provides some of the best lines in the film and his overt jealously over the affection of Shrek with the character voiced by Antonio Bandares made me forget that I was watching computer-generated animals instead of real people.The villains in Shrek 2 an upgrade from the first film and that says plenty considering the energy and comedic indifference brought to the screen by John Lithgow's Farquaad brought us in 2001. Maybe that is because there are so many evildoers in Shrek 2 that it keeps it more interesting. The Fairy Godmother and her son Prince Charming are the obvious scoundrels in part two, but the king and even the Bandares' Puss In Boots start out as characters out for their own agenda until struck with a sense of responsibility. The combination of these characters all at one time after the misunderstood Shrek ups the ante of the evil quotient, and the audience is better of because of it.For all my misconceptions before the film even began that were corrected, I will concur that the movie is not perfect. There is a musical number with the Fairy Godmother and talking furniture that was hard to understand and too Disney for a film that tries to be better than anything that Studio has generated over the past decade. And maybe it was just me, but I thought the animation was not as crisp as the first. Maybe we have been spoiled by computer-generated films like Monsters Inc. and Ice Age over the last few years and we don't marvel at the complexity of the images any more. But I remember sitting almost jaw-agape in Shrek while I thought some of the images in Shrek 2 were unclear or lacked detail.But maybe I am just nitpicking. For Shrek 2 is one of the best films of the year even if we haven't reached the half way mark yet. The finale of the film set to Bonnie Tyler's Holding Out For A Hero was rousing and the most entertaining sequence I have seen an animated film as yet. As Shrek jumps from the Ghostbusters inspired Gingerbread Man, I almost cheered out loud along with my youthful audience in support of our unexpecting warrior. And anything that can excite me is definitely worth noting.A classic.",Shrek 2
86,agmoldham,Pretty Good,6,8 July 2004,"It seems that virtually all cg films are more or less guaranteed to be a hit. I guess it must have been similar with some of the early Disney films. The usp of these films is that they appeal to everyone - Whether you're a snotty nosed 6 year old, a courting couple or newly retired you can't help but like these films. There's something for everybody - For the kids there's the larger than life characters and for the adults there's lots of references to other films and 'adult' humour. For everybody there's loads of laughs.Personally I always find references to other films a bit too clever and distracting from the plot. Shrek 2 is entertaining and is guaranteed to be another box office hit and makes Shrek 3 an inevitability. It is rather good though - 7/10",Shrek 2
87,ja_kitty_71,The Shrek story continues,10,3 July 2010,"The story continues after ""happily ever after,"" when Shrek and Fiona come back from their honeymoon, they find an invitation to a royal ball with Fiona's parents to celebrate their marriage, an event Shrek is reluctant to participate in. Fiona talks him into it, and along with Donkey, they travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away. They meet Fiona's parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian, who are surprised and repulsed by Fiona's choice of husband (particularly the King himself), since they had arranged that Prince Charming rescue her from the castle but now they see that her husband is an ogre.At a shared meal, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument over how Shrek and Fiona will raise their family, and Fiona, disgusted at Shrek and her father's behavior, locks herself away in her room that evening, where she meets her Fairy Godmother, who is also surprised at Fiona's new looks. King Harold is later accosted by the Fairy Godmother and Charming, her son. The two retell the Prince's adventures and how he overcame many obstacles and climbed a high tower in order to rescue Fiona, finding instead the cross-dressing wolf. They reprimand Harold for breaking an old promise that Charming would be able to marry Fiona and demand that he find a way to get rid of Shrek. During the night, Shrek secretly reads Fiona's diary and pages containing the single phrase ""Mrs. Fiona Charming."" Then Harold arranges for Shrek and Donkey to join him on a fictitious hunting trip, which really is a trap to lure the two into the hands of an assassin, Puss in Boots. Puss is unable to defeat Shrek and, revealing that he was paid by Harold, asks to come along as a way to make amends. The three sneak into the Fairy Godmother's potion factory and steal a ""Happily Ever After"" potion that Shrek believes will restore Fiona's love for him.And that is all I am telling you folks - you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends. I love Rupert Everett's (Prince Charming) narration for the storybook prologue. And also, I think it's good sequel to go with the original film.",Shrek 2
88,rainking_es,That cat!,8,26 July 2004,"Shrek 2 begins at Shrek and Fiona's honeymoon. Just where we left them in the first part. Everything goes just fine for our favourite ogres, but tranquility won't last that much. Soon they'll have to leave they're peaceful marsh to go and visit Fiona's parents at the kingdom of Far Faraway. And it's in Far Faraway where the real fun begins.I'm not very keen on animation movies. I've just watched a few ones (Shrek 1 & 2, Monsters Inc., Titan A.E, Final Fantasy...), and I really don't consider them as real cinema. But let me tell you: It does not matter to me if Shrek 2 is real cinema or it isn't, because it has the more lucid, witty, and funny script that I've seen in the last years. It goes without saying that Shrek 2 is quite better than the first part. The basis is the same: parodies of classic fairy tales (Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Pinocho, Puss In Boots) , recent Hollywood hits (Lord Of The Rings, Mission: Impossible, Meet The Parents...), and American TV shows (E!, Cops...). OK, there're dozens of movies that rely on that (Scary Movie, Hot Shots, Top Secret..), and I hate almost each and every one of them; but whereas in most of that movies parodies are brute and clumsy , in Shrek they're just brilliant: you'll kill yourself laughing again and again. As for the characters we got Shrek, the Donkey, Princess Fiona, and all the fairy tale creatures (Pinocho, Three Little Pigs, ...), and all the ones we met in the first part. Of course, thre're a lot of new incorporation's: and the best of all'em is the Puss In Boots. In the Spanish version (the one I've watched), Antonio Banderas dubs the cat as he did in the English one. I've always mistrust Banderas' capacity for dubbing. My fellow country-man (he's from Málaga, just like me) is quite a good actor, so temperamental and versatile; but he dubbed some of his first characters in Hollywood, and he made clear that he wasn't born to dub himself. Anyway, I must say that he's made a superb job dubbing the cat. The best character (for me) from Shrek 2. Each and every one of the cat's appearing are just hilarious (the one at the dungeons!!!). Of course, Shrek and the Donkey are so funny too, but I can't help it: the cat kills me. Last but not least let's talk about the animations themselves: JUST ASTONISHING! As I've said before I haven't watched many animation movies, but I can't figure out how Shrek animations could possibly be overcome. Character's expressions are incredible. They do it even better than the most of present-day actors! Ben Affleck o Mark Wahlberg wouldn't be able to look as innocent as Puss In Boots (in the scenes in which he does). Well, you know what I mean. Verdict: the best animation movie I've ever watched. My rate. 8/10",Shrek 2
89,mitsubishizero,Improves on the first one!,10,22 May 2019,"The first one was great in how it poked fun at Disney and fairy tales as a whole. The second one takes it up a notch in the best way. It introduces new characters and even more funny gags such as the one in the beginning where Shrek and Fiona are celebrating their honeymoon. There're a lot of nods to fairytales, old movies and Disney such the scene where Fiona kiss on the beach only for shrek to realize he's kissing Ariel from The little mermaid. This causes Fiona to drag her off and throw her back into the sea where she gets devoured by sharks soon afterwards.After they get home they get a message from Fiona's parents who are the king and queen requesting they meet her new husband. As you can imagine things don't go well as planned leading to hijinks and emotional moments. What I like about this movie is that it takes the characters and develops them even further. Shrek is known for being laid back but here it shows even more of his vulnerable side.Despite what he's done in the previous movie he's still not accepted by society which makes him for how Fiona's parents and how they'll react to him. There's not much else to say other than it's a great movie. I highly recommend it to fans of the first one.",Shrek 2
90,bellino-angelo2014,Great sequel that lives up to the first one,9,5 August 2019,"I really loved the first SHREK movie, it was great, funny, clever and full of endearing characters. Sometimes sequels don't live to the original, but this is not the case because SHREK 2 is, at times, even better than the first one. It has much more characters, great soundtrack and a great cast.This movie begins with Shrek and Fiona that have their honeymoon and returning home they are invited to visit Fiona's parents (King Harold and Queen Lillian) in the kingdom of Far Far Away. Of course Fiona's parents are shocked to see their daughter transformed, and especially Harold tries to get rid of Shrek once and for all even paying Puss in Boots (an expert ogre hunter). In the meanwhile the Fairy Godmother along with her son Prince Charming tries to plan the wedding between Fiona and Charming. But, after Puss becomes friends with Shrek and Donkey, the trio does everything (with also the help of the fairytale creatures) for stop Charming and save Fiona.The animation is great and stunning like in the first one, with vivid colours and nice backgrounds. The soundtrack is even better than that of the predecessor, with much more songs (including Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas' cover of ''Livin la Vida Loca''). All the actors are pretty good, especially Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz as Shrek, Donkey and Fiona. Rupert Everett is deliciously evil as prince Charming, Antonio Banderas' Puss in Boots is very likeable and adorable and Julie Andrews in one of her most recent movies to date is perfect as Queen Lillian.All in all, one of the best sequels to CGI animated movies ever made and one of the rarest sequels that even surpass the original in terms of quality and story. Worth recommended.",Shrek 2
91,brookenichole-98054,Really great!,9,1 August 2021,"Shrek 2 is by far the best Shrek movie! Every scene, especially with music, is just so perfect! The voice acting is perfect, the comedy's great, and the story is wonderful! Even the new characters are fun and add excitement to the plot. I loved how the story deals with a great theme about Shrek learning to love himself even when everyone else doesn't. And I really enjoyed the music from this movie to the point where I could sing almost every one.Overall, a pretty perfect movie!",Shrek 2
92,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,One of DreamWorks Animation's best sequels with perfect comedy and compelling drama,10,20 May 2020,"Considering it's been 15 (now 16) years, this sequel still holds up to this day. The music score from Harry Gregson Williams (who co-composed the score of the first film with John Powell) reprises the same themes with new motifs very well and fit the atmosphere and drama. The animation is stupendous with gorgeously detailed locations and neat expressions from not only the main protagonists, but the other side characters as well.In fact, the characters are great. Shrek is still the lovable ogre we know and love as he experiences relationship issues with Fiona upon meeting her parents of Far Far Away. Fiona also gets another nice character arc due to whether she would return to her beautiful princess form or remain an ogre forever. Donkey is still the wacky sidekick, but he's still endearing and funny. The new characters are nice additions. King Harold and Queen Lillian of Far Far Away are interesting due to their connection to Fiona and the reason why she got sent away to the Dragon's Keep. Prince Charming, who appeared in the beginning of this film, is not only funny, but an interesting contrast to Shrek. And then there's Puss in Boots and Fairy Godmother, the best characters in the entire franchise. The swashbuckling kitten is so lovable and delivers the comedy perfectly as well as providing some sincere drama while Fairy Godmother makes for a great villain when compared to Lord Farquaad.And last but not least, the writing which is well thought-out and compelling. It expands on the original film and does something new by providing compelling character arcs for Shrek and Fiona. Also, the romance retains the heart of the original very well. It also has some of the best comedy in animation history including a trumpet fanfare version of Hawaii Five-O, and everything involving Puss in Boots and Fairy Godmother. Some of the pop songs fitted the scenes very well particularly the action sequence where Shrek, Donkey, and Puss escape with the Happily Ever After potion and the Fairy Godmother's cover version of Holding Out for a Hero creates tension in the film's climax perfectly.Overall, Shrek 2 is not only one of DreamWorks Animation's best films, it's also one of the best animation sequels with perfect comedy and compelling drama that expands on the first Shrek movie. Recommended.",Shrek 2
93,rebeljenn,"witty, good animation...Better than the first",8,7 May 2006,"'Shrek 2' is a better story, in my opinion, than the first film. The animation is still done very well, and the characters and scenarios are much funnier, and I think it appeals to a wider audience (both adults and children). While watching this film, I could tell that the people who created it had a lot of fun; this is evident in the attention to detail and some of the inside jokes. In summary, this film follows Shrek and his fiancé to meet his fiancé's parents. Along the way, they meet Puss 'n' Boots and learn how to be happy with themselves for who they are without trying to have society mould them into being what it wants. The story and situations are more memorable than the first film's, and the conflict and action sequences are also done better and with a sense of humor. Again, all of the characters are voiced well and bring a strong sense of emotion and fun to the animated characters. I recommend this to children and adults. There is plenty of humor and enjoyable moments for both children and adults, and all age groups will be influenced in a slightly different manner. There's also some good morals to the story.",Shrek 2

After the great success of the first Shrek, the sequel leaps into a not that interesting story maybe, but just as charming and nicely told, the makers keep coming up with fantastic good ideas and with such a brilliant edge to it (as Pinocchio using women's underwear) the Shrek thing is about to become one of the best and most charming ideas around, and everything's open for a third.SHREK 2 takes the laughs as said earlier, to a even more entertaining level, and the characters are brilliant every single one of them. Though the main focus being off course around Shrek, his wife and the talk sick donkey, the true loveliness lays in all the great gems being around here. Though they were just as good in the first, there were few. The sequel pours funny ideas like it was the easiest thing in the world onto the whole Shrek 2 movie.Mike Myers is great, so with Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Eddie Murphy and so on.

95,grahamsj3,very good sequel,7,26 December 2004,"Sequels are usually not as good as the originals, but this one breaks that mold. It is every bit as entertaining as Shrek was. The fact that there is continuity between them, and the characters all have the same voices as in Shrek really helps. Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy all reprise their roles as Shrek, Fiona and Donkey. The basic story is that Pricess Fiona and Shrek have gotten married and have been invited back to the Princess's parents kingdom to celebrate the marriage. Howver, the King doesn't like the fact that Fiona married and ogre and has also become one all the time herself. She was supposed to have married Prince Charming, who would have broken the ogre spell for her. There is a wicked fairy godmother to contend with as well.

We have the old shrek crew reunited and add the talents of John Cleese, Julie Andrews, Rupert Everett and Jennifer Saunders.  Tony Banderas brings in some extra comedy relief and the Poos in boots, a hired hit-cat, brought in to do in our hero.  The action is lively, the exchanges snappy, the dialogue is humorous and Eddie Murphy doesn't lose control, for a change.  The landscape is filled with visual and thematic puns, the CGIs are seamless and the story works.  This is a very different film than the original, much less ""down and dirty,"" albeit they do have lots of fart and body function jokes, but the film has a maturity in tackling issues like sacrificing for someone you love, accepting who we are, and refusing to be beaten down by prejudice.

98,Mightyzebra,Not the best of the lot,7,1 December 2007,"As are all of the Shrek films, this is very entertaining, hilarious and exciting. However, it has more unhappiness than any of the others and more unfairness, which may bring it down for some people. The characters' personalities are very noticeable...Shrek's personality: In this film, Shrek is rather unhappy, moved or sentimental. He is unhappy because (for some absurd reason) he thinks Fiona doesn't love him because he is an ogre, he is moved by the stunningly adoring face of Puss in boots and he is sentimental because of Fiona and him loving each other. Overall, he is not as good as he is in the first film - or even the third. He doesn't even supply many jokes in this one.Donkey's personality: As funny as ever, Donkey is also a little grumpy in this one, but makes much more of an amusing, uplifting performance than his comrade Shrek. ***SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD, SLIGHT Spoiler AHEAD!!** He is also very entertaining as a white stallion, his looks are certainly handsome!Princess Fiona's personality: A bit like Shrek, Fiona's personality is too slightly disappointing, luckily supplying a few jokes (she supplied just about none in the first film - but a few in the third) She usually feels unhappy, confused and angry. You hardly see a smile on her. Dragon's personality: Disappointingly the dragon just about doesn't appear in the film at all, except for a bit at the very end. This is one downfall to this film.NEW CHARACTERSHarold: You can tell immediately that Harold has a rather high temper and is rather nervous. Overall though he is a good character, as he loves Fiona and his wife Lilian dearly. ***QUITE MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!!** He also develops a friendship with Shrek. Harold is probably the one to turn the film's plot around to a very worrying, thrilling point. Quite a good character.Lilian: Lilian's personality is not completely clear, but though she's very nice and becomes worried quite easily, she's not the perfect queen who is good as gold. She doesn't mind speaking out her worries (in the third film she shows this much more). A good character. Puss in boots: Soon to be Shrek and Donkey's new companion, Puss appears sinister at first, but is really quite a nice ball of fur, although can fight with a sword and could probably kill Shrek if he tried. Fairy Godmother: Probably the main baddie, the Fairy Godmother is not such a sweet kind godmother when she puts her mind to it. She can also become rather aggressive.Prince Charming: Not all that charming after all, this rather cowardly prince who keeps moaning to his mother (the Fairy Godmother) is determined to kill Shrek, using whatever means necessary.What happens is that Shrek and Fiona are going to celebrate their marriage at a ball prepared by Fiona's parents in Far Far Away. Unfortunately, Fiona's father is not at all happy that her daughter has married and IS an ogre. Things are taking a turn for the surprising... All in all, this is a good film, but for a ""Shrek"" sequel, it could be slightly better. Enjoy ""Shrek 2""!",Shrek 2
99,TheOtherFool,Lacking in wit and charm,5,20 January 2005,"The original Shrek was a treat for the eye, and deserved the praise, awards and money it got. Too bad the sequel doesn't really provide any of the aspects that made 'Shrek' such a fun movie.The main problem of the movie I think is that 'Shrek' now is an engaged man (well, male ogre anyway), who feels he has to 'fit in' in society. If in part 1 he was free to be himself, now he is bound by rules. In this way, the story feels more 'real' if you will, with real people and real emotions playing a part in the 'Kingdom, Far Far Away'.

When he showed his cute face, I couldn't resist but do 'Aaaah'.2) Fiona is shown as a great woman who will never cheat Shrek and will do anything for his happiness. Cameron Diaz has given an excellent voice for Fiona.3) Eddie Murphy as donkey strikes the right notes again. His face is really funny and Eddie Murphy's voice makes him more funnier.4) Some of the jokes were really funny and had a bit of adult humor to make it funnier, especially the Pinnocchio one.5) The side characters, the gender confused wolf, Gingy, the rat and other characters from different fairy tales add a zing to the movie. The wolf looked too hilarious.6) Fairy Godmother's voice casting was perfect and filled with evil.7) Mike Myers as Shrek is really good as his voice is not too rough and so, we can see that even though ogres look too tough, from inside, they are not so tough and bad but kind.8) It was like seeing a film meant for all ages. Adults would enjoy the humor and the dances and the songs were shown as if it were not an animated but a real life film.9) There is more of character detail unlike the previous film of all the humans of far far away.Overall, a great sequel for all ages.",Shrek 2
103,movieguy1021,Shrek 2: 5/10,5,29 May 2004,"Some movies completely stand on their own without the need of a sequel. Some don't need sequels, but do anyway, successfully, like the Toy Story movies. And some don't need sequels, but are made anyway. Shrek 2 is a combination of the first and third. Shrek was such an original, groundbreaking film, that any tweak could diminish how great the first one is. That tweak is Shrek 2, an obligatory cash-cow sequel that's so far off from everything that made the first so good that you can hardly believe it's based off the right movie.Shrek (voice of Mike Myers), who seems to have lost most of his ogre-ish edge, is now married to a transformed Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and they're summoned to Fiona's parents' castle in the land of Far Far Away. They (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) don't accept either, and the king hires Puss-in-Boots (Antonio Banderas) to kill Shrek. Will Shrek survive? Will the king and queen look over Shrek and Fiona's differences? Will this movie try something new? I think we all know the answers to those questions.The main problem of Shrek 2 is that everyone forgets that they have a first movie that they need to live up to. Although the animation, groundbreaking in the first, was the same (how could they really improve?), the plot and the characters lack in freshness. Usually in sequels, one or two new characters need to be introduced. Here we have a half-dozen or more. And, if Shrek hadn't made any changes for Fiona, why was he not mean and ogre-like? The whole theme of the movie was to be yourself-so why wasn't Shrek throughout the movie? And Donkey's (Eddie Murphy) character seemed to decrease in personality. Instead of being constantly annoying, like he's supposed to be, all he does is sing. The worst, though, is that the writers did not find some sort of stupid way to get Lord Farquuad, one of the funniest and most interesting characters from the original, back somehow.The humor in Shrek 2 is misguided. The comedy is either crudity or satire. And the satire is just piled in heaps over us, but lots of it isn't that funny. When Shrek and Fiona first get to Far Far Away, it resembles a popular southern California city. There are parodies of stores in there, except they're all hard to see, and the ones I could see weren't funny. While crudity is often funny, here it's just people farting and belching for the most part. Instead of working parody around humor that comes naturally, the whole movie seems to be one long spoof of something or another. I guess the first one exhausted all of the fairy-tale references, so this one had to go to further depths for satire. Some were funny, but many weren't.What the movie also lacked was any true sentimentality. Although the message is more obvious, there are very few, if any, tender moments in the film. It's weird to be saying this in an animated film, but there was no connection between Shrek and Fiona. Chemistry usually makes the movie, but I couldn't sense any here. Before I'm lynched, I'd like to say that there were quite a few parts that were funny. The best was probably the addition of the Ugly Stepsister, whose voice I shall keep secret. The dinner-table scene between Shrek and the king was also pretty funny, as were a few others.Myers didn't seem to be trying here-using his lighter Fat Bastard accent again, but basically copying off what he did in the first. Diaz isn't that great of a voice actress, but it worked. Murphy didn't have as much to do, which really brought his character down. Banderas, whose Puss-in-Boots has been universally acclaimed, did a fine job with his Zorro-like character, but the character itself just wasn't funny. Ohhh, I get it! He's a cat, so he does cat-related things! Next you're going to be telling me Spider-Man shoots webs. All sarcasm aside, Cleese and Andrews did a good job, but I think the best was probably Rupert Everett as Prince Charming. The character and the voice were both great.I had been looking forward to Shrek 2 since I first heard about it. What a disappointment.My rating: 5/10Rated PG for some crude humor, a brief substance reference and some suggestive content.",Shrek 2
104,Min111,I like the Donkey,7,3 March 2020,"This movie starts right after the first one, and the sequel wasn't a bad movie. It was fine. I wouldn't say it was quite as good as the first one, but Shrek 2 was still a good sequel. Shrek 2 was funny. I like the part where they say: ""Are we there yet?"" That was one of the funny moments, and I like how it takes them forever to get to the castle. I also liked the music or songs in Shrek 2 - it fitted well I thought. I liked the characters introduced in this movie such as the Donkey, Princess Fiona, Prince Charming etc. Another one of the characters in this movie, the Fairy Godmother, was a good villain in Shrek 2. I also liked that Gingerbread Man: it made me feel hungry. My favourite of the lot was that Donkey. I liked how he turned into a horse, but I still prefer him as that cute, little Donkey we all like.",Shrek 2

106,vampyrecowboy,Love the Cat,9,12 January 2009,"Puss in Boots was the best character in there.Developed really good with character and even duologue.While I enjoyed all of the Shrek films, Puss in Boots has enough merit to stand on his own in his own film.I like the little inside jokes about Hollywood and the ""knights"" takes on ""cops"".Graphics are pretty awesome, story is nicely crafted and while there are people who don't get this...that's OK...they are the kind of people who enjoy stuff blowing up for no reason - and there are plenty of movies made for them.This movie and the other Shrek movies are great.Hilarious, nicely paced with a good story and the proper humor for today.Voice casting was great - especially Antonio Banderas...I never thought that I would like a Shrek movie, then one day I just happened to be in a room where one was playing (Shrek 3) and after that I watched the entire show.I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to see the first 2.Really cool in so many ways.I don't really think that the story was made for kids as much as it was made for teens or even adults under 35.The way it's written with the little inside jokes into todays culture plays to more like a crowd of 15 - 35ish.Had this not been made in animation, the film probably would never had been made or even put past the first reader.I like it...and it entertained.It made me laugh...and there are so may comedies which don't.Once again - Antonio's voice casting was exceptional casting for the cat. Wow...who would have thought?",Shrek 2
107,OriginalMovieBuff21,Saw it and liked it,8,26 May 2004,"Shrek 2 is very funny. Puss in Boots, The Donkey, Gingerbread man, and Pinnochio are by far the funniest characters throughout the movie. The animation is excellent and even better than the 1st. The humor is good, maybe not better than the 1st ones but it still makes me laugh and it definitely entertained me. The negative parts are that there is really not a story in the movie like the 1st one had and I couldn't stand that fairy godmother, she annoyed me and she had really had no laughs like Lord Farquad had. This was still and entertaining movie and I think it enjoyed me. I'd like them to have another sequel. Recommended film!!7.5/10",Shrek 2
108,EmperorNortonII,Once Upon Another Time...,9,19 June 2004,"First, there was ""Shrek,"" a clever satire on the familiar fairy tales of old.  Now we have, ""Shrek 2,"" in which we see what happens after the ""ugly ever after"" of ""Shrek.""  For one thing, we meet the Prince Charming that Fiona had been expecting!  I found this just as clever and well-animated as the first.  And new characters add to the fun.  Antonio Banderas is a wonderful surprise as Puss in Boots, and John Cleese delivers a great performance as King Harold.  All the sight gags offer a feast for the eyes. Dreamworks Animation has given us a great franchise with ""Shrek,"" and more chapters in their fractured fairy tale already are on the way.  I'll certainly be waiting!",Shrek 2
109,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: funny, original, even better",8,22 May 2004,"It's easy for a sequel to repeat the first movie in a formulaic way. Austin Powers 2, another Mike Meyers film, certainly did. But Shrek 2 is even better than the first film. Unlike the original, Shrek 2 has a strong plot. Although it's a kid's film, Shrek 2 has a healthy dose of material for older folks so it works 100% as a film for adults.The computer graphics are beyond spectacular. I work in the field and I can tell you, when it comes to loose fabric clothing and hair, it's photorealistic now whereas just 10 years ago it would have been nearly impossible to do at all. Amazing.But similar to Toy Story, the effects do not overpower the plot. There's a real story and it's touching and contains a few twists. A few criticisms. The ending was too syrupy. The music didn't work for me... rock tunes not matching the mood and uninteresting ""musical"" melodies. And, like the original film, I did not find the donkey to be annoying but lovable. Just annoying. Neither the donkey nor the new hairy companion do much of anything in the film.Who should see this film:-- All kids-- People who like comedies, this one's even more accessible for adults than Toy Story.I'll give Shrek a well-deserved 8 out of 10.",Shrek 2
110,AvionPrince16,Nice Second movie,8,13 November 2021,An interesting chapter it was very great and it treat a them that can happen to anyone. The women present her husband to her parents and the husband is not what the parents excpected. So shrek try to please them. It really have a mature story even if it look funny in the first impressions ; it can happen to everyone (not please the girl physically). And i found the movie really interesting. I recommend also for the funny moments and the situations who can be dramatic. Very nice animation.,Shrek 2
111,dilipbts,Shrek 2,8,29 April 2020,"Shrek 2 has as much humor, talent, and fun as the original classic, and almost as much heart. The film picks up where Shrek left off, with Fiona and Shrek celebrating their marriage, but they are immediately cast into a new adventure when summoned to the land of Far Far Away (a clever parody of Hollywood), to the court of Fiona's mother and father, for a surprise royal wedding ball. The only problem, as it turns out, is that Fiona has married the wrong guy - according to everybody but Shrek, Fiona, and their friends.The plot, revolving around this central problem, is helped along by nearly constant allusions to virtually every fairy tale in the English canon, and satirical references to many recent popular films. Unsatisfied with the combination of romantic comedy, Hollywood satire and self-parody, the film-makers' also went all out with a clever original soundtrack, making Shrek 2 as much of a musical as anything else.The voice talent is just as essential as it was in the first film, and there's more of it, with John Cleese and Antonio Banderas giving very memorable performances. And the animation is, unsurprisingly, lovely.To their credit, Dreamworks kept the core talent in place, but created a somewhat different formula for this film. Even though I expect most fans of the first film to adore the second, I am not sure Shrek 2 is going to make the franchise any new fans. Though more clearly made for adult audiences than the original, Shrek 2 is still warm-hearted family fare. As much as I DO recommend this film, and as entertaining as I think it will be for just about anybody, I don't consider Shrek 2 to be quite the classic Shrek was. It's touching and goofy, to be sure, but it's much more of a Hollywood film than the original, and it doesn't quite reach the same levels. Nevertheless, it is one of the better sequels I have seen, and it was definitely worth both the price of admission and a third or fourth viewing of the DVD.",Shrek 2
112,departed07,"Like a chart, it rises and falls",7,22 February 2008,"Shrek 2 was one of the promising sequels in 2004 where after the first movie was a box-office hit three years before because it introduced a character full of life and energy.The whole gang's back, but with a little bit less energy.After Shrek (Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) marry from the first film, they come back from their honeymoon where their old pal Donkey (Eddie Murphy) is waiting for them. They receive a note from Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julia Andrews) that they are invited to stay with them in Far, Far, Away. There are two problems with this situation: 1.) Fiona is now an ogre, 2.) How will she break the news that she's a monster while her husband is not prince charming? In Shrek 2, we get more characters from The Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) who's ticked off after her son Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) didn't marry Fiona to break the spell and threatens Fiona's father if things don't go well as plan. There's Puss-In-Boots (Antonio Banderas), a cat with a Zorro like attitude who shows his ""P"" signature as he is hired by Fiona's father to take care of the lovable ogre until the jolly green giant gets his hand on him first.The sequel carries the tradition of the original film where it plays a satire of every pop culture we've seen from movies, television shows and in music. Some parts of the film work, but it doesn't have the same energy as the first movie where it blended in ethnic jokes with bad language; something between Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein as I mentioned in my review of the first movie. Somehow the film itself is like the first film itself, but then again it's Shrek and I like this film. I don't love this film as much as I do with the classic original, but who can resist the lovable ogre?",Shrek 2

114,FilmFanInTheHouse,Not Many Animations Are As Funny As This!,8,25 November 2007,"Shrek 2 (2004, Dir. Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury & Conrad Vernon)Shrek has rescued Princess Fiona, got married, and now is time to meet the parents. Shrek, Fiona and Donkey set off to Far, Far Away to meet Fiona's mother and father. But not everyone is happy. Shrek and the King find it hard to get along, and there's tension in the marriage. It's not just the family who are unhappy. Prince Charming returns from a failed attempt at rescuing Fiona, and works alongside his mother, the Fairy Godmother, to try and find a way to get Shrek away from Fiona.When 'Shrek' was released it broke all box office predictions. It was a hugely entertaining movie. Now, 'Shrek 2' had to be better than this. It definitely achieved it. The script is so much improved, with a lot more jokes appearing and a lot more popular culture references appearing from all of the place. The characters are back to the wonderful ways they were in the previous film. Puss in Boots, the new addition to the film, is as high a character up there with Donkey. Everyone will enjoy him not matter what, and Antonio Banderas is perfect as him. The animation is top notch and a joy to watch. The movie also includes a lot of music and singing moments by the characters. These are not distracting and add to the wonderful experience.

116,Flagrant-Baronessa,A Dream World by DreamWorks,7,28 September 2006,"Shrek has now vanquished the fire-breathing dragon, eradicated the evil Lord Farquaad and married his Princess Fiona. But now he is facing his biggest challenge yet  meeting Fiona's parents in the Land of Far, Far Away. Dreamworks' second animated installment in the Shrek series was the surprise of the year for me, because it really is every bit as funny as its predecessor  but perhaps not as original or novel, and therefore not as memorable.The animation, on the other hand, is perfected this time around. Dreamworks always go all the way in this aspect and the result is top-notch and easily exceeds that of its peers (Pixar, Blue Skye Studios). The greatest showcase for this manifests itself in the beginning of the film as Shrek, Fiona and Donkey set out to the Land of Far, Far Away in a horse-driven carriage and travel across mountains, fields, woods and passes  this journey features such gorgeously striking visuals of its scenery that it just touches me. It is downright aesthetically intoxicating. Its wide-ranging gallery of eccentric characters have also been paid great attention to  this time gloriously supported by A-list actors (John Cleese, Julie Andrews, Rupert Everett)  both in animation and in story. Although Shrek and Fiona are still largely central to the story they now occasionally take a backseat to the new sparkling creatures like Puss-in-Boots, Fairy Godmother, Fiona's parents and yet more of Pinnocchio, Gingie and their crew in the swamp. The film is having a lot of self-referential fun in navigating its many story lines and inside-jokes and it makes no pretense about it. Shrek 2 is therefore positively peppered with rapid-fire dialogue, deadpan humour, pop-culture references and homages (to Ghost Busters, Blazing Saddles, The Lord of the Rings and MORE). It's a little more brave, and a little less serious.The most credit is however due to its score. I'll admit that I don't know much about subtle musical scores in films, nor is it something that I always pick up on, but in Shrek is becomes the film. Eels make a great appearance in the soundtrack, as does alternative rock songs and classic songs (Funkytown - Lipps, Inc.)  it's amazingly catchy and thanks to its continuous scoring (music in some form in nearly every scene) it invests the film in a sort of lyrical flow. It all fits perfectly and smoothly with the fluid animation and the fairytale setting. It's a dream world beautifully captured by Dreamworks.Although its key plot outline of Shrek meeting Fiona's parents and feeling inadequate is well-sketched, it suffers numerous diversions that take the form of jokes, detours and supporting characters, massively straying from the template  all of which you cannot help but feel do not quite belong in the story, and serve only the purpose of blatant humour and homages. There is nothing wrong with that per se, but the film occasionally feels a bit disjointed because of it. Its disorganisation is its fatal flaw but there is another woeful mistake in Shrek 2  its final, cheesy song-and-dancer number at the end. WHY or WHY do so many films fall prey to this horrible device?!Granted, the latter is not enough to ruin a film on its own but it does remind me of a rather nasty approach that you occasionally feel it takes. Letting its actors shine. Parts of Shrek 2 thereby acts more as an elaborate excuse to parade the 'fun, quirky' actors behind the characters (Antonio Banderas' Hispanic accent seems to be an endless source of amusement as far as the film is concerned). This approach, combined with its slight disorganisation makes this sequel slightly inferior to Shrek I. It is, however, a very funny film that caters to all ages. 7 out of 10",Shrek 2

Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy star in this sequel. John Cleese and Julie Andrews are the parents of princess Fiona in this movie and I have to say they play that part well. They are perfect for each other. If you see Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and John Cleese were all raw comedians before and now they are in children movies and John Cleese works for the humor department on TBS. This movie is worth the money and worth your time if you are a Shrek fan or a Eddie Murphy fan this movie if for you.",Shrek 2
118,hokeybutt,Uh... Tom Waits and Nick Cave? How The Heck Did They Get Invited?,7,2 April 2005,"SHREK 2 (3+ outta 5 stars) Not quite as good as the first movie... but still pretty good. I think the main problem is that they tried to squeeze too many characters in from the first movie instead of concentrating on new ones? (Did we really need to see Pinocchio and the Gingerbread Man again?) The highlight of this movie is the introduction of Antonio Banderas as ""Puss in Boots"" but, PLEASE, IF THERE IS A SHREK 3 YOU DON'T NEED TO SHOE-HORN HIM IN THERE AGAIN! It reminds me of the Saturday Night Live syndrome where they keep doing sketches with the same character but every new sketch is just a little bit less funny than the one before it... until eventually you forget why the character was even funny in the first place. I could have even done without the donkey this time around... but I guess they *had* to put Eddie Murphy back in... even though he served no purpose and wasn't even as funny this time around. On the plus side, there are lots of funny bits... and some touching moments and some decent music (Tom Waits and Nick Cave BOTH contributing to the soundtrack??? Woo hoo! Too bad about that atrocious re-make of The Buzzcocks' ""Ever Fallen In Love""... couldn't they have just used the original? Why must the children be made to suffer so?) Shrek and Fiona (and Donkey... uh, why is he there again?) take a trip to meet Fiona's folks, whose hoity-toity royal pedigree doesn't quite mesh with their daughter's new-found ogre-ness. There is a new villain this time around (thank goodness they resisted the temptation to bring Farquad back from the dead)... a fairy godmother (played by Jennifer Saunders) who isn't actually as benevolent as she pretends to be. I just wonder if all these modern pop culture references (The Matrix, Americican Idol) are going to make sense to viewers in another 20 years?",Shrek 2
119,diac228,"Compared to the original Shrek, this is more than a disappointment",5,2 June 2004,"From the beginning I knew it was going to be difficult to beat the original; which is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. Just before Shrek 2 came out I was watching Shrek on NBC. I was watching when the Gingerbread Man was being tortured, when Robin Hood and his merry men were getting their butts beaten by Princes Fiona [In Matrix-style fashion], and also the classic ending, in which all the fairy tale creatures were dancing and jamming to 'I'm a Believer.' It was going to be tough to beat this one. It is pretty much like Shark Tales trying to come close to Finding Nemo's success [Which is pretty much an impossible task, especially after I saw the trailer for it].I see the critic's reviews of the movie, which were pretty much mixed. I saw the movie trailers, no help whatsoever. I checked the box-office numbers, and it obviously showed that Shrek 2 was anticipated by a lot of people; but then again, sometimes a lot of money does not mean a spectacular movie [Matrix Reloaded, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]. In the end, I went to see it with my mom and my two brothers. The end result was not good. I laughed more watching one episode of 'Marriedwith Children.' Heck, I probably laughed even more listening to D12's 'My Band,' another one of Eminem's hip-hop satires. Shrek 2 made me laugh, do not get me wrong [hardly ever though], but it was nothing compared to the original Shrek.The plot is that Shrek and Fiona were invited to see Fiona's parents in Far Far Away, which have no idea who she married. Throughout the movie, you see that there was a plan for Fiona to actually marry Prince Charming, not Shrek. During the movie, the main conflict involves Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, The Fairy Godmother [Shocking], The King and Queen of Far Far Away, and also Puss In Boots, which is most likely the best character in the movie [I will explain later]. The plot has its twists and turns, which is why I will not explain the plot into more detail.Shrek 2 has only 2 funny characters, and one of them was funnier in the first one. Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy, was just annoying through the entire film, containing only a few smart lines and a few funny moments as a Stallion. Puss In Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas, is the character that saved the movie. Fiona was not funny anymore, neither was Shrek, the Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, and not even the Three Pigs were funny. As for Puss In Boots, he came up with a lot of smart lines, and funny moments that involves his animal instincts. Puss In Boots moans and complains in Spanish, fights with dignity, and also is cute when he wants to be. Puss In Boots also was caught on a fairy tale version of 'Cops', usually was seen competing with Donkey for becoming Shrek' best friend, and was even flirting around with women [Fiona was one of them]. The three blind mice had a lot more screen time the 2nd time around, and that did help a little bit.Shrek 2 had more music than the first one, but it was a lot worse. Shrek 2's songs includes the always-fun 'Funkytown', this one horrible song by Counting Crows, a few songs by the Fairy Grandmother [disgusting], and a very mediocre version of 'Livin' La Vida Loca'. The beginning of Shrek 2 was weaker, the ending was much weaker, the jokes were not as funny, it was not as emotionally moving, and had a lot less standout funny scenes than the original. Wait, as a matter of fact, there were NO standout funny scenes in Shrek 2.Shrek 2 also had a lot more cheap shots at Disney, since Shrek happens to be the 'anti-Disney.' Some of the jokes against Disney were okay, but others were just plain dreadful. This Disney-Dreamworks competition has got to stop, it is crazy, and the sad part is, Disney always wins. It happened with the Antz-Bug's Life contest [No contest, A Bug's Life creamed Antz], happened with the Shrek-Monster's Inc. competition, which resulted in Monsters, Inc. winning more money even though it lost the Oscar, and now we have the Finding Nemo-wannabe Shark Tales coming out this fall, which is totally going to flop [No pun intended]. Back to this movie. Shrek 2 had a lot more pop culture jokes, but some of them came off as stupid, while others did prevail [Example: Puss In Boots, being a orange cat, saying 'I hate Mondays.' Unless you have not heard of Garfield the Cat, you know what the joke is]. Just like the Matrix and Legally Blonde, they should have left Shrek without a sequel.In the end, it was a weak movie, especially compared to the original Academy-Award winning Shrek. It will be hard to win an Oscar the 2nd time around, especially with the upcoming animated movies 'The Incredibles' [Since when has Pixar failed us???] and also the underestimated 'Spongebob Squarepants: The Movie' [Well, this cartoon has won an Emmy before, so an Oscar does not look too bad]. Shrek 3 [Which is coming out eventually] better have smarter writing, less cheap jokes, and must try to bring the humor back to the main characters, otherwise, this franchise will lose a lot of fans. Will I see this again? No. Will I see Shrek 3? Maybe, as long as Puss In Boots comes back.Final Score: 4/10 [Originally, I gave it a 3 but I will give it a 4 for Antonio Bandera's standout performance.]",Shrek 2
120,supertom-3,Computer Generated Hilarity!!,9,29 July 2004,"Each year it seems we now expect our big animated extravaganza. Usually one a year but 2004 sees Shrek 2 and Shark Tale vying with the Incredibles from the master animation team Pixar. Outside of Pixar, DreamWorks is a company with a good track record. It certainly seems that many of these companies are accelerating beyond the old masters Disney, who up until recently had a piece of the Pixar pie without much creative credit or merit for hits like Toy Story and Finding Nemo. The Shreks are the best 3d animations outside of the Toy Story series and Finding Nemo, they are funny and decidedly more biting to pop culture with a lot of hysterical referential jokes.Shrek 2 is one of the best films this year. It lives up to the first film, and exceeds it in terms of animation, cameos, and jokes. Once again the three leads, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz are excellent in their roles, with Murphy once again stealing the show and making us wonder why he can't be funny in his live action roles anymore. The list of supporting parts is huge. There is everyone's favourite hilltop singing, umbrella wielding Dame, Julie Andrews, who plays the Queen of Far Far Away, and what a Queen she'd make in real life. Then you have John Cleese as her husband the King who to my delight and many others has a few Basil Fawlty-esque moments. Also starring is Rupert Everett as Prince Charming and the always brilliant Jennifer Saunders, and what a shame her comedy partner Dawn French wasn't given a role, although she appeared to fun effect in Harry Potter 3 and will subsequently appear in The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe so we've had are Hollywood Dawn fix. The star of this piece though is Antonio Banderas who has garnered rave reviews for his portrayal of the ingenious creation, Puss in boots, a send up of Zorro. Banderas hisses, purrs and coughs up fur-balls to the delight of the audience. There are plenty of other small cameos including British presenter, Jonathan Ross as an ugly sister his voice specially put in for the British version. Basically the film is pure hilarity and charm start to finish.Shrek 2 is a film that would be extremely hard not to love. The few critics who felt negatively towards this must truly be miserable because it's pure, simple and charming entertainment which is arguably better than the first, perhaps not in terms of thrills but in terms of broader comedy and of course improved animation. I can't see how anyone could not have plenty of laughs out of this and kids especially will love it. For me there was barely a loose cog in a highly efficient, well oiled machine of a movie, it's a film that the cinema is made for. For me this is an animated movie that will be difficult to beat this year, Shark Tale and The Incredibles look great, can they beat this? Who knows? I would say though that I still prefer Finding Nemo to this.

123,christian123,Better then the original,6,25 November 2004,"Shrek 2 is a fun movie to watch for the whole family and it improves over the original. Shrek 2 continues the story with Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) going with his new wife, Fiona (Cameron Diaz), to meet his in-laws, the King and Queen of the Kingdom of Far Far Away, which bears more than a resemblance to Beverly Hills. But are they ready for their new ogre son-in-law and their daughter's new look? The King (voiced by John Cleese) seems to have his own plans and he enlists the aid of the Fairy Godmother and Puss in Boots to get what he wants. They plot is good and the execution is pretty good considering that most animated sequels are pretty cheap. I thought the first Shrek was okay nothing special but this one was a lot more funnier. I think what makes this movie work better then the first is the additional characters. Puss In Boots voiced by Antonio Banderas is hilarious and I thought he was a good addition to the cast. Of course having Mike Myers as Shrek was funny too and Eddie Murphy is still to annoying and he was the only reason why I didn't give this movie a ten. Cameron Diaz is good too but I felt she didn't really do anything special. Rupert Everett, Julie Andrews, Jennifer Saunders and John Cleese are all great additions to the cast and make this movie charming. The movie is quick and short but is able to leave so many funny moments you wonder why other comedies don't try this hard. Shrek 2 is the best kids movie I have seen this year and proves that even with a simplistic plot you can still let adults enjoy it. The story, the characters, the direction and the dialog are all smart and funny. Rating 8/10 perfect movie except for Eddie Murphy and everyone should watch.",Shrek 2
124,theshadow908,"Good sequel, but it doesn't live up.",7,10 July 2006,"Shrek 2 picks up where Shrek and Fiona are now married. They travel with Donkey to Far Far Away so Shrek can meet her parents. Nothing goes right, and Shrek and Fiona end up fighting. Fiona's father even hires Puss In Boots, an ogre assassin, to take Shrek out. However, Puss ends up befriending Shrek, and they set out to foil the evil fairy god mother, who wants Prince Charming married to Fiona. This isn't as good as the first movie, but it's okay.Shrek 2 has a complete change of style from the first film. It is still a good movie for children and adults alike, but the humour is a little more crude this time, even though it will still most likely go over their heads. The humour is actually kind of lacking though compared to the first one. I think the movie focuses too much time on Fiona and her parents rather than Shrek and Donkey. The dramatic scenes might kind of bog the film down too. Perhaps the movie is too ambitious.The voice talent is just as good. We have newcomers such as Julie Andrews, John Cleese, and Antonio Bandaras. They all do phenomenal jobs in their roles.Overall, this is still a good movie for kids and adults, but it just isn't the same as the first time around.7/10",Shrek 2

While the first one was great and had its funny parts, I was cracking up through the entire duration of the sequel!  The sequel was definitely tackled upon with a different attitude. It was much more of a parody than the first as there were numerous spoofs of Hollywood blockbusters and cliched scenes.  The characters had a lot more ""pazaaz"" in them.  (Don't ask what that means.)  It had modern characters, attitudes, cultures, and even amenities in a kingdom ""far, far, away,"" which was awesome.  This movie was geared more towards the adult audience.  I don't know if it's a good idea taking very little kids to watch this movie. This movie is a must-see!",Shrek 2
127,nickmesafilms,Shrek 2 (2004) - Fairy Godmothers + Cats in Boots + Meet the Parents = A TERRIFIC ANIMATED SEQUEL!,10,13 October 2011,"As a fan of the very first ""Shrek"" movie, I was well entertained by the wonderful creativity of the story and all the memorable, hilarious characters. Now, with the new sequel, ""Shrek 2"" brought the very same thing, only this time, newer characters, an incredible new story, and a more bigger heart than the first movie. ""Shrek 2"" tells the story of Shrek and Fiona after their honeymoon, invited to the kingdom of Far Far Away to meet Fiona's parents, and the father doesn't accept Shrek because he is an ogre, and hires a killer cat named Puss in Boots to kill the ogre, but ends up being a humble sidekick. Then, the Fairy Godmother does everything in her power to make sure no ogres live happily ever after. This is such a dark storyline for an animated movie. ""Shrek 2"" is one of the best sequels to an even greater animated movie. It makes more improvement, and it brings more fantastic wonders than the first movie. The characters are still memorable and enjoying, and the new Puss in Boots character, portrayed by Antonio Banderas, is crystal perfect. The surroundings are beautiful, the comedy is priceless, the humor is incredible, and the finale blends with perfect heartwarming depth. Yep, so you can tell this is one of the better animated movies than the mildly annoying ""Shark Tale"". ""Shrek 2"" has all the elements you would want to see in a sequel, and it helped the movie receive its $900,000,000 reward in the box office. ""Shrek 2"", in my review, ""a brilliant animated sequel, truly an instant classic"".",Shrek 2
128,SonicStuart,Fun As Well As The First Movie!,10,23 May 2004,"SHREK 2Voices: Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Juilan Andrews, John Cleese, Antonio Banderas, Rupert Everett and Jennifer SaundersRated: PGGenre: Animation/Adventure/Comedy/Romance/Family/FantasyStar Rating: ***** out of 5Shrek is one of my favorite movies ever and so is this sequel! As we enter the sequel, Shrek (voiced by the amazing Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (voiced by the rich and beautiful Cameron Diaz) are now married and while they were off on their honeymoon, Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) was watching the swamp. But when Shrek and Fiona are back from their honeymoon they head out at once again when they get an invite to the King (voiced by John Cleese) and Queen (voiced by Juile Andrews) of Far Far Away, aka Fiona's parents. One of the funny things about this movie is when Shrek, Donkey and Fiona are traveling to Far Far Away, Donkey keeps asking if they were there yet and gets bored until they get there. The King and Queen are shocked when they found out that their daughter had married an ogre! The Fairy Godmother (voiced by Jennifer Saunders) finds out that the King had forgotten about the deal he made with her about having Fiona marrying Prince Charming, the Fairy Godmother's son (voiced by Rupert Everett). So then when the King just decided to keep going with the idea, the King hires a cat zorro desperado kind of character named Puss-in-Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas). But later Puss-in-Boots later becomes good and helps Shrek and Donkey on their quest to help Shrek make Fiona happy because when Shrek and Fiona got to Far Far Away, Shrek and the king didn't really see each other eye to eye. This movie spoofed Spider-Man, Mission Impossible, Ghostbusters, the reality TV-show Cops and Guess Who Is Coming To Dinner.SPOILER WARNING: In this movie we get to see Shrek turned into a human and Donkey turned into a stallion! We get to see Fiona back in human also. Also in the end when they are showing the credits they show this one part where Dragon came back to Donkey and they had little dragon-donkey babies which I thought was funny and cute.My favorite parts was when the movie was spoofing Guess Who's Coming To Dinner and Mission Impossible when Shrek, Donkey and Puss-In-Boots were escaping the dungeon. Yet again we have another animation movie success with great humor and beautiful animation and characters!BOTTOM LINE: WHO SAYS ORGES CAN'T HAVING HAPPY ENDINGS? WELL SHREK SAYS ORGES CAN HAVE HAPPY ENDINGS!",Shrek 2
129,Puroo,I like this even more than the prequel,10,11 July 2021,"As a kid I hated Shrek. But after seeing it for the first time a few years ago, I decided that I really liked Shrek. I had to go on a vacation soon after finishing the first movie, so right after coming back I proceeded to watch the next one. And I think it's probably because of the trip or something, but I actually liked Shrek 2 more. There are many reasons why I feel this one is clearly superior to the first one, and why this is my favourite sequel among any movie (other than Lord of the Rings and The Dark Knight trilogies of course).The movie begins with the part where Shrek 1 ended. Shrek and Fiona are happily married and live their ogre lives in peace. The reason why this movie works so well is because unlike regular sequels, this one actually expanded on what could happen in future. If this was a conventional sequel it would have shown that Lord Farquaad has come back somehow and now he has joined forces with some other villain to beat them. Also some random characters would have been introduced while others would have been killed.The movie simply begins with the feeling of an adventure. Shrek, Donkey and Fiona going to Far, Far Away to meet Fiona's parents who have never seen her in the last 20 years, that's a perfect story. Remember how we thought about Shrek and Fiona before the first movie? We changed our minds for the better after we watched the movie and learnt a lesson. Fiona's parents, however, have still not seen that happen. And this is something Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming take the advantage of.The reason why this movie worked but the next two didn't was because this movie never dragged any concept. Shrek and the fairy tale characters became friends, Shrek and Donkey saved Fiona, they fell in love and married. Period. This was never 'revised' upon. Rather either the consequences of those actions or the other aspects of life were shown. Every scene looked interesting for some reason. It's almost like the creators poured all their love in every scene. No scene feels like they were just trying to get over it. Every moment is cherished: Fiona crying, Shrek meeting Puss, Shrek's friends watching TV - everything is memorable.Shrek 2 is how a sequel should be. It should give us exactly what we wish to know. It does not force any character, it does not force any scene. Everything that is introduced in this movie, every joke that takes place happens within the audience's interest. I really wish if a new Shrek movie is made, they make it like this. Shrek is meant to be something that is remembered for all time, not a meme. It's one of the most iconic 3D animated movies I've ever seen.",Shrek 2
130,Hunky Stud,very funny with a predictable ending.,8,29 June 2004,"It is rare that a simple animation film can be so funny. The story is quite simple and predictable. But the people who worked on this film made it an excellent comedy. They are probably the first people who blended so many modern US culture into the old prince-princess story. I am sure that there will be more films copying this concept. While it is very funny now, I doubt that it will become a classic for the later generation to enjoy. Because culture constantly changes, what we know now won't be the same in the future. And since this film has so many Americanized culture icons, I also wonder if the rest of the world would enjoy this film as much as we do.",Shrek 2

132,Quicksand,Shrek 2: Cruise Control,8,24 May 2004,"The musical numbers aren't funny, inspired, or even any good; the 'reinventing' of signs and logos, while funny, are nothing we haven't already seen on ""The Simpsons,"" a thousand times; and the clever, creative soundtrack of the first film is watered down by many bands who are thrown in just to sell a few more records, and not because they have particularly interesting voices, or the talent of Tom Waits or Leonard Cohen or even Joan Jett.The first one was a fairy tale; this one is just a wacky comedy, with dull, lifeless musical numbers that won't appeal to anyone over the age of seven. (Ricky Martin?!  Were the Spice Girls too expensive?) I appreciate the adult jokes thrown in with the kids stuff, but nothing is worth hearing Eddie Murphy sing.  Puss in Boots is funny, the Fairy Godmother isn't, and while the animation is beautiful... the movie itself is just as good as it can possibly be, without being as good as the original.",Shrek 2
133,Rendanlovell,The constant references are a little much,6,6 July 2020,"I can't say this hasn't dated, because it has, but not in the way you'd think. The animation is surprisingly, not bad. Faces and human models are a little rubbery and have awkward movements but the textures/environments are alright. The way it's aged though has a lot more to do with the constant references. I remember the original doing this (haven't seen it in years) but not to this extent. The first ten minutes are stuffed with nothing but references on top of references. It's like watching an episode of Family Guy. The story too has pretty heavy handed social commentary. That said, I still enjoyed this. The fantasy parody doesn't land as hard as the original Shrek, but they do attempt to tackle other things instead of rehashing the original. The cast is great including the new voice actors and there are some genuinely funny moments. What I'm saying is, it's a mixed bag.",Shrek 2

1. The animation has massively improved since the first film which does wonders for the intended emotions via upgraded facial expressions.2. There are a multitude of great voice performances by Antonio Banderas (Puss In Boots), Eddie Murphy (Donkey), Jennifer Saunders (Fairy Godmother), Mike Myers (Shrek), John Cleese (King) and Rupert Everett (Prince Charming).3. The world is really intricately designed with brilliant attention-to-detail thus helping the world feel more real.4. The soundtrack is fun and lively. It even incorporates songs with lyrics to match the tone and feelings.5. The humour works as naturally inserted through character interactions.6. The movie displays an appropriately heartwarming message of being yourself, but also allowing for change where necessary.7. The pacing is excellent which keeps the film moving briskly whilst allowing for character development.Cons:
1. The animation is still a little off despite its' obvious improvement.2. There are a couple lazy plot-holes: A) Somehow none of Fairy Godmother's minions recognise Shrek as he snook in even though he made it blatantly obvious.

Fiona's parents are not very interesting.  The Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming(played by the overrated Jennifer Saunders and Rupert Everett) are also quite dull. Antonio Bandaras Puss N Boots is funny though (Note to filmakers, jokes about cat hairballs can now be retired.  It wasn't funny in Cat In The Hat and it isn't funny in Shrek 2.)

Surprised by Shrek's kindness towards him, Puss decides to make amends by helping Shrek and Donkey, even though Donkey is a little jealous...And as the Satanic Godmother puts her evil plans in motion, will Shrek and Fiona's love survive?

141,Stompgal_87,My favourite in the 'Shrek' franchise,10,31 March 2014,"I remember seeing this in the cinema 10 years ago after having already enjoyed the first. When I finished watching this, I found it even better than the first one. At university today while myself and my fellow classmates were getting on with our own work, one of them put on this film as some background noise and we all laughed at it so hard.The animation here is just as good as that in the original while the backgrounds and human character designs are realistic. I also liked the usual designs on Shrek (as well as his transformation into a human), Fiona (who temporarily turns into human form) and Donkey while Puss in Boots was an amusing new supporting character that also looked realistic. The dialogue has a similar formula to that in the original and some similar lines but it is still engaging and hilarious. I liked how the script paid homage not only to various fairy tales some films ('Lord of the Rings' and 'The Wizard of Oz)' and a couple of nursery rhymes ('Jack and Jill' and 'Do You Know the Muffin Man') but also modern culture such as one of the musicians playing the 'Hawaii Five-O' theme on the trumpet (that really cracked me up today), Far, Far Away being based on Hollywood and 'Knights' being a spoof of 'Cops.' This film uses a similar technique to 'The Flintstones' (that combined the 1960s with the Stone Age) by combining the Middle Ages with the early 21st century. Moving onto the voice acting, Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy did as solid a job as voicing their characters in the first while Antonio Banderas as Puss, Julie Andrews as the Queen, John Cleese as the King, Rupert Everett as Prince Charming and Jennifer Saunders as the Fairy Godmother were equally entertaining. The soundtrack is also very good. It consists of a fantastical musical score plus original pop songs such as 'Accidentally In Love' by Counting Crows, 'Funkytown' by Lipps Inc, the Fairy Godmother's song she performs when she is first introduced plus also her rendition of Bonnie Tyler's 'Holding Out For A Hero' and Puss and Donkey's rendition of Ricky Martin's 'Livin' La Vida Loca.'Overall this is a funny and charming second instalment in the 'Shrek' franchise with a cracking soundtrack and great new characters. 10/10.",Shrek 2

And I'm thrilled that Disney still gets skewered. I don't understand why people feel those animated films shouldn't be ridiculed. ""Shrek 2"" takes a while to get cranking - maybe we're spoiled because the original was a clever send-up from the beginning. The opening's a bit too mellow this time. But once Puss-in-Boots (voiced wonderfully by Antonio Banderas) appears on the scene, ""Shrek 2"" turns into a thrilling story.Kids will no doubt love the slapstick humor and fart jokes, but there's plenty in ""Shrek 2"" to keep adults laughing, too. Granted, even some older teens might not get some of the post-modern references - there are riffs on ""From Here to Eternity,"" ""Flashdance"" (it's very funny), ""The Fabulous Baker Boys,"" ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Alien."" The film pokes fun of Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" and even takes shots at Disney World's penchant for spotless sidewalks and streets. And just see what happens to the Little Mermaid!There are some priceless moments in this film. The scene where Pinocchio's truth is revealed is hysterically funny and there's some mild adult humor tossed in for good measure in a scene involving three maidens.
The film occasionally strains when it tries being a bit too clever and the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming aren't as funny as they could be.But at a time when Disney churns out tiresome animated films, it's good to know there's ""Shrek 2"" not only giving Disney a well-deserved send-up, but also providing solid animated entertainment that doesn't insult the intelligence of adults.",Shrek 2

And while ""Shrek 2"" is still an enjoyable movie, it very clearly more of the same, or actually a bit less of the same.""Shrek 2"" continues along the lines of the first movie, but all in all it seems a lot milder and a little less funny than the first movie, which made a lot of fun of fairy tales in general and Disney in particular. While this movie still does that from time to time, on the whole the jokes are more aimed at other movies and pop-culture and seem to be a lot less sharp...there's nothing here that is remotely as funny as the exploding bird from the first movie (although the dog that gets crushed comes close).On the whole, I'd even say that the movie is sometimes a bit dull. There's more story and less jokes this time around, and since the story is really predictable, I often found myself thinking ""just get on with it so we can get to the jokes again"".That being said, ""Shrek 2"" does still have a lot to offer. The new character Puss in Boots is absolutely brilliant, as is John Cleese as the king of Far Far Away. There are also much more references to movies and TV series this time around, and trying to spot them all is a lot of fun. Also, the animation looks absolutely superb, and there are some very fluid and memorable action sequences.So, all in all, ""Shrek 2"" still delivers. On the one hand, it's more of the same, only a bit milder and more boring. On the other hand though, there are still enough entertaining characters, jokes, and spoofs to make for an entertaining movie.***1/2 out of *****",Shrek 2
145,theinaniloquent,"""Once upon another time...""",9,12 May 2012,"Shrek was a fantastic animation. It had everything you would need to enjoy it and appreciate it, too. It was a satire of fairy tales and happy endings, one that is sure to make you laugh. But speculation was arise when a sequel was announced, because only bad thoughts came into my mind. Sequels are sometimes good, but mostly bad. And especially how Shrek was an animation, they always try to do what the first did best.. So instead of complaining and expecting another bad sequel, I sat down to watch it, not much in my mind.. I'm glad to say, all this build-up of bad thoughts simmer out, as Shrek 2 gradually places itself AHEAD of the first.. The thing I loved was how they can this one a modernized look at fairy tales. This could lead to some bad things, but they knew what they were doing with it. We have a Hollywood-esque ""Far, Far Away"" that is sure to have you grinning. It's just how they executed it, they did a fantastic job. And the animation improved as well. There was so much to look at, so much colors projected onto the screen, I was in awe how much they stepped up. And people who are expecting to see the 'magic' of the first disappear, you're in for a shock. The whole atmosphere was there, albeit it's modernized twist. We have the great somehow fitting music, the underlying adult jokes, and the characters are all there. Some things were downgraded, some things were upgraded. You are sure to enjoy it. And that's what I loved about it. You see the first Shrek scoring itself a satire, and the second doing this as well, but adding new things as well. And this was the point of sequels before, and Shrek 2 fits the definition. A bigger, BETTER film than the first, one that can use new things but succeed at doing so. I loved it. Some things were changed, big deal. It all worked in it's own way. I recommend for fans of the first, and haters of the third and forth. It contains the same magic of the first (still succeeds at it's satirical view of fairy tales) but also works alone. Fantástico!9/10.",Shrek 2

The fairy godmother is supposed to be pleasant, not mean and vicious. And prince charming is supposed to be nice and not mean. Just like the original Shrek, this movie pokes fun of so many fairy tales. The donkey was much less annoying in this movie than the original Shrek. And Puss in Boots was a creative idea.

Good movie to enjoy as a family, but the sexual innuendo was definitely not necessary.  Surely they didn't have to have (SPOILER) Pinocchio wearing women's underwear!!  That was definitely TMI...and I didn't find it funny.  We all loved Antonio Banderas as ""Puss in Boots"", and Eddie Murphy was still funny as Donkey.  Jennifer Saunders, Julie Andrews, John Cleese and Rupert Everett all turned in very funny performances.  This was a little too PC for my husband, but it was still enjoyable...a good way to spend an afternoon. The gross-out fart jokes, belching and the bugs are wearing thin, however.

Of course, I felt like I was the only one who got some of the jokes (and I am sure I missed some).  As a sign of the subtlety of some of the jokes in this movie, the love potion has the roman numerals 'IX' on the bottle.  Of course, there are also plenty of obvious jokes (fart jokes, slapstick comedy, etc.).

I love the scene when he and Fiona first meet.  Perhaps the sappy eyes bit could have been used a BIT too often, but that's only a minor little quibble.  In fact my only real complaint is that the pop references and gags come in a bit TOO fast, almost overwhelming the basic plotline.  But what the hell? Everyone should just go and have a jolly old time with this one!",Shrek 2
151,johnny-08,For all generations,10,9 June 2007,"""Shrek 2"" is excellent movie and in my opinion even better then the first one. This movie is so innovative, warm and brilliant. And also very funny. The whole story is great and for a sequel this is masterpiece. We all know how sequels can disappoint.Directors did their job very well and all characters look like they are alive. Well known actors gave their voices to the characters. Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Rupert Everett, Jennifer Saunders. All of them were great. But I have to specially congratulate Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas. Murphy is excellent and he continues to shine as Donkey. Antonio Banderas is new. His character Puss In Boots is my favorite. So new, fresh and cleverly made.Very important: don't believe to those who say this movie is for children. This movie is for all generations. For all of you who didn't forgot that they were children once. For those who forgot that, allow Shrek to refresh your memory.",Shrek 2
152,moviedude1,Second verse...way better than the first!,10,23 May 2004,"I always go into writing a review for films without reading the comments that already have been posted, but this time was different and I agree with them...it isn't often where the sequels are better than the original, but Shrek 2 has seemed to accomplish that feat! Leave it alone, boys! Go out on top while you can!When Shrek and his bride get back from their honeymoon, they find that the Princess' family insist that they travel to her homeland and celebrate their nuptials there! Much to Shrek's chagrin, they make the trip and encounter some strange characters in their journey (the best one of all, Puss 'N' Boots, played by Antonio Banderas).I was a video store manager when the original came out on VHS & DVD, so it got burned out rather quickly, but it was a good burn, if you know what I mean. I'd really be happy ""burning"" this one out, too, when it comes out! I'm not much for repeats, but I'm going to this one again!",Shrek 2
153,ryan_kuhn,"""How many cats can wear boots?""",8,18 June 2005,"Mike Myers' most famous role used to be Austin Powers, but with the limited success of the last Powers' outing, Shrek may be Myers' comedic legacy. And we are better off for it. Shrek is a lovable ogre with human emotions, wants, needs, and problems. What guy hasn't had a problem with meeting his girlfriend's/wife's parents? The movie begins with Shrek (Mike Myers) and his new wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) meeting her parents in a Hollywood-esquire kingdom, Far Far Away, lead by Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews). Upon their arrival, the parents are less than thrilled to see two ogres greeting them. Much of the humor early in the film comes at the expense of Hollywood, as the same sly humor that entered in the first Shrek movie, making fun of Disney, returns here in the sequel. The basic conflict in the movie is identifiable to almost anyone out there, as Shrek tries to find a way to make himself acceptable to Fiona's parents. He even goes as far as to consult the local Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) for help. Problem for Shrek is that the Fairy Godmother is trying to get Fiona to marry her son, the doofus Prince Charming (Rupert Everett). I liked how the savior of so many fairy tales is finally knocked down a peg or two, with Prince Charming the butt of many jokes here. Puss In Boots, a Zorro-like cat (Antonio Banderas) wedges himself between Shrek and his best pal Donkey (Eddie Murphy), adding some more depth to the characters in this movie. I won't go into more detail about the plot, except to say that the movie goes from gag to gag in a surprisingly human way, while keeping the movie in the world of fairy tales. I liked how they were able to keep Shrek a character with real emotions, keeping the story going. The humor, mostly Hollywood references, keeps the movie light and entertaining. The shameless tie-in with American Idol at the end of the film was a bit on the cutesy side, but they kept it funny enough for it to not be annoying. Good, solid, family entertainment here that will make the kids and adults laugh, and enough story here to engage viewers of all ages.",Shrek 2
154,patrick_dunne,Very funny parody,7,20 December 2005,"Shrek 2 is a very funny movie.It's the sequel to Shrek. The whole thing is a bunch of parodies of classic fairy tales, including Little Red Riding Hood, The Three Blind Mice and The Three Little Pigs. It also includes many pop-culture references, but not too many of them.However, even with it's jokes, it doesn't live up to the original. (in my opinion)(Sorry for the short review. I have many others to write.) 7/10Good: Funny, witty and sweet parody with good storylineBad: I am a bit biased, because I am comparing it to the original. Also, HBO shows it too much.",Shrek 2
155,Ronin47,"Ok, but nothing special (**1/2)",6,8 June 2004,"I was one of the five people who didn't completely fawn over the original ""Shrek"". I thought there were parts that were hugely clever and funny and it was beautifully animated and had a good soundtrack, but as a whole I found it uninvolving and despite its engaging, carefree spirit, a bit dull.
""Shrek 2"" is pretty much exactly the same. Beautiful animation, quirky rock and pop songs on the soundtrack including a cover of an old Buzzcocks song (!), and there are some very clever jokes. But Mike Myers' faux-Scottish accent is still annoying, Eddie Murphy's voice is still PROFOUNDLY annoying, and once again, the story itself is uninvolving for the most part.
""Shrek 2"" picks up just after the honeymoon as Shrek and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are getting home. They receive an invitation from her parents (the King and Queen of Far, Far Away) to come home so they can meet her husband. So it's basically like ""Meet The Parents"" with fairy tale characters. I think they could have been a little more creative.
There's also a complicated subplot about a scheming Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) and her dim son, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) that isn't interesting enough to go into. One good new character is Puss-In-Boots (Antonio Banderas), a witty little cat who can disarm anyone by turning on his big, weepy kitten eyes. Hopefully for ""Shrek 3"" they could get rid of Donkey (Murphy's irritating character) and keep Puss-In-Boots around. There are some good jokes scattered around, such as a TV show that's like ""Cops"" called ""Knights"" and a scene where a giant gingerbread man is attacking a Starbucks, and the people inside run out and take cover in...another Starbucks right across the street. And once again there's some good songs (by artists like Tom Waits, eels, Counting Crows, Frou Frou). But they blow that in the end, because of all the songs in the world, they actually choose ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" as the closing number (did ANYONE EVER want to hear that song again?)
So it's smart and pretty funny in places, but like the original ""Shrek"" there's just something not quite satisfying about it.",Shrek 2

157,The_Orenda,Disappointing,6,1 June 2004,"Shrek 2's hype does not change the fact that the sequel is not on par with the original. Thankfully, all the actors made their return and the new characters joining the movie are entertaining. The sequel's special effects are much more stand out, with the people looking less rigid and Fiona, more fair. But aside from these factors, Shrek 2 looks like it could have been made for a straight-for-video release.Shrek and Fiona are living happily ever after. That changes when Shrek has to meet his in-laws, Far, Far Away.What's missing in Shrek 2 is that the first movie had more wit, character and drive. Shrek 2 is a respectable add-on lacking in action, driven by story and its own references. Audiences will no doubt enjoy, but like Myers' Austin Powers sequels, the expectation to deliver good should have been better.",Shrek 2
158,Benjamin_Cox,A good laugh but not exactly a classic - 75%,7,11 February 2009,"Thanks to the continuing brilliance of Pixar, the animated feature has enjoyed a huge resurgence of popularity recently, buoyed by jaw-dropping CG, decent scripts that strain to distance themselves from the overly-preachy Disney fairy tales of yore and a vocal cast to die for. But just as Disney dominated the market for decades, Pixar's dominance has been near-total. In fact, the only real pretender to the throne was Dreamworks' hugely successful ""Shrek"" so it was no real surprise when this sequel duly arrived and did even better, despite Eddie Murphy's shameless scene-stealing.Picking up where the first film left off, ogres Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) return from their honeymoon to their swamp where Donkey (Murphy) has been squatting. But just as they are about to settle down, they are invited to Far Far Away by Fiona's human parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) who wish to toast the happy couple. Trouble is, they have no idea what has happened to Fiona or exactly who she has married and before long, the scheming king and a troublesome Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) are cooking up a whole load of trouble for our heroes in the shape of the not-so menacing Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas).Essentially ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"" in green, the plot isn't anything like as strong as it was in the first film although it is still an entertaining picture. Adapting the Pixar approach of appealing to young and not-so-young viewers, the movie is so crammed with characters and references that it's impossible to take it all in at the first viewing. But the references are very knowing, almost winking at you in a ""look how clever we are"" fashion and to be honest, it started to grate after a while. Much like Murphy does, although his part is not as prevalent as before which is a relief. No, the true star of ""Shrek 2"" is undoubtedly Banderas as Puss In Boots who expertly sends up his ""Zorro"" persona with genuinely funny one-liners and a comic touch that the other characters seem to lack. Saunders, Cleese and Andrews are a disappointment but none more so than Rupert Everett as Prince Charming who is underused and not especially funny.""Shrek 2"" has plenty of enthusiasm and energy but sadly, not enough ideas to make it a cast-iron classic. It's still quality entertainment and still much better than recent efforts (""Igor"" and ""Space Chimps"" spring to mind - avoid if you can) but still not enough to make Pixar worry just yet. As the franchise rumbles on to a third and eventually a fourth movie, one wonders if they've peaked too soon. The original ""Shrek"" was different from the others, unburdened as it was by Disney's strict supervision and daring to be a little subversive - shackles that Pixar themselves have now broken free from. If anything, ""Shrek 2"" is too conservative and not challenging enough. The story is pretty traditional shtick for animated features and the constant references (check out IMDb's trivia section to see what I mean) are only sporadically funny. I'd still recommend most Pixar films above this franchise - ""The Incredibles"" is the most fun I've ever had watching an animated movie and ""Wall-E"" is so good, I could wax lyrical all day long. But if Pixar's magic doesn't work on you then stick with ""Shrek"" or ""Shrek 2"". It just needs a little more fairy dust sprinkled on it...",Shrek 2
159,Bravesfan17,A great sequel,8,16 May 2011,"Back in 2004, Dreamworks did an excellent job of giving people what they were wanting to see: another Shrek adventure on the big screen. I liked how the films starts with another storybook opening with Prince Charming going out to find the famous princess, locked in the highest room of the tallest tower. I also liked how the film puts the joke on Charming and the audience with Charming finding out the princess is on her honeymoon.We then pick up where we first left off in the original with Shrek and Fiona being newlyweds happily getting home. We find that Donkey never left and wants to hang out with Shrek and Fiona, even though he has a love in his life in the dragon who once guarded Fiona. We then find that Shrek's life is interrupted as soldiers from the kingdom of Far Far Away have summoned Shrek and Fiona to come to Far Far Away to receive a blessing from Fiona's parents, who are the king and queen.Shrek unwillingly goes, and Far Far Away is great at being a spoof on Hollywood. Problems arise when King Harold does not approve of Fiona marrying an ogre and everyone has a fight over what Fiona's parents did to her and how everyone is behaving. This summons Harold to pay someone to murder Shrek. Not too long after, we are introduced to the Fairy Godmother, who has the ability to grant wishes to those who want a happily ever after. Before going to bed, Harold invites Shrek to go on a morning hunt, even though it is intended to be a trap.This is where we are introduced to a new character, Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas. Banderas is brilliant at bringing that mysteriousness and genius to Puss and how daring he can be. Quickly after, Shrek immediately starts liking Puss while Donkey feels a bit threatened.Now we are on a puzzle to find out why Harold doesn't like Shrek and not want him to be with Fiona. It is now Shrek, Donkey, and newcomer Puss in Boots on a whole new adventure. The laughs continue and the story continues to be exciting as there are more layers to be peeled. This sequel has done well of being up there with the original in terms of quality.",Shrek 2
160,saarvardi,Puss in Boots steels the show whilst Shrek strengthens his reign over kiddy land,10,3 May 2007,"How could you possibly continue a kiddy animated film that ended on a ""happily ever after"" note? Show the audience what happens next. The mixture of pop culture references and brothers Grimm mythology will do the rest. And really, how can one stay apathetic when facing the big green ogre  who, despite all his grunts, is adorable as hell? Children aged 0-100 can easily relate to the big guy who just wants to be left alone with his wife in their cuddly swamp home, and for everyone in ""Far Far Away"" land to just leave him alone.When legend prepares a different fate for him, Shrek will go through the means to right all the wrongs, and with the help of his loyal friends Donkey and Puss in Boots (one of the most clever interpretations of a fairytale character in my book) he'll get his happy ending  even if it means going against the charming Prince and the evil fairy godmother themselves. While Shrek 2 is a lesser film than the original, which was a comical romp that made me laugh myself silly; the sequel succeeds in reeling you into the imaginative land where giant Gingerbread guys come alive and ""I Need a Hero"" becomes a mighty hit once again. Here here.",Shrek 2
161,jrfranklin01,A Close 2nd,9,26 May 2004,"Exiting the theater, I was engulfed in a strange mental cloud of sorts after having just watched Shrek 2.  The experience was one of confusion: WHY CAN'T ALL SEQUELS BE THIS GOOD?  Its not like Dreamworks did anything that they weren't good at and knew how to deliver on, great comedy transmitted through excellent animation.  Maybe directors should be required to do animation before they actually go out in the world and work with real people and a try to develop a real story.  I think of all the sequels I have seen and some of them I absolutely cringe at the thought of.  But Shrek 2 was a spectacular sequel, a close 2nd to its predecessor.  And what's even better with this type of film as opposed to others is that children and adults alike can enjoy it.  There is no need for cursing or sex or graphic violence for the movie to still be a huge hit at the box office.  It's kind of like Bill Cosby's comedy.  He made the audience laugh without cheapening his performance with vulgarity.  That in my book made him a true comedian just as it makes Shrek and its sequel a truly enjoyable movie.  I won't spoil you with the plot progression of Shrek 2.  I am so confident that you will like it, that you should just go out and watch it to find out for yourself.  Expect all of the great CG animation that you saw in the first, all the great characters (save that of the dragon and Farquuad), and all the great comedy.  And this one's definitely a keeper for anyone's movie collection.",Shrek 2
162,Pavel-8,Not a kids movie.,8,31 May 2004,"I don't care what anyone says, ""Shrek 2"" is not a kids movie. Yes, of course it's targeted towards the single-digit age crowd, but while they will no doubt enjoy it, this sequel is a little bit cruder, packed with more humor, and features a more complex story without the heart of the original.The storyline of ""Shrek 2"" is ""Meet the Parents"" plus ""Beauty & the Beast"" all blended together inside a Fractured Fairy Tale. Shrek and his bride Fiona venture Far Far Away (yes, that's the name of the country) to encounter her parents for the first time. Of course calamity ensues, involving Donkey, a far-from-normal Fairy Godmother, Prince Charming, and Puss-in-Boots, an assassin who is one of the most entertaining animated characters in recent memory. The misadventures compose the story, which won't be difficult to follow for anyone past puberty. Younger viewers may not fully understand the plot, but there is enough mustache-twirling to clarify who is doing what to whom. What kids won't get is the pervasive tongue-in-cheek humor. I could name off a dozen movies and television shows that ""Shrek 2"" parodies, ranging from ""Spider-Man"" to ""C.O.P.S."" Some of these spoofs (such as the latter) are hilarious; some are predictable yet enjoyable; and sometimes they come so fast and furious that it feels like a ""Scary Movie."" On top of this, there are the ubiquitous visual gags. Any sign, poster, or storefront you can find is probably a medieval-ized piece of modern pop culture. For example, if you look closely, you'll spy a poster for ""Lethal Arrow 4"" hanging at a Tower of London Records.Nearly all of these in-jokes are humorous, but after a while, they wear on you, revealing what is missing from ""Shrek 2"": the good-natured heart of the first one. In ""Shrek,"" the edgy humor that saturates the sequel was present, but the generally good nature neutralized the sarcasm. Without that counterbalance, the unrelenting comedy eventually feels too smug. I see it as the other side of the Disney coin. For example, some criticized ""Monsters, Inc."" for being overly sweet and sentimental. While I fully understand those comments, you also know what you're in for when you watch an animated Disney film. Likewise with most of Dreamworks animation. Like it or not, the studio has established a precedent of edgy humor to which it adheres. I suppose I should have expected the overwhelming tongue-in-cheek nature, but for whatever reason I didn't, and that bothered me a little. But I still completely enjoyed the film. I'm the type who likes to watch what is going on in the background, and for people like me, ""Shrek 2"" is a feast.The vocal work is again excellent. To complement the returning trio of Mike Myers (Shrek), Cameron Diaz (Fiona), and Eddie Murphy (Donkey), Dreamworks has added an all-star lineup that includes Julie Andrews (Queen ), John Cleese (King), Rupert Everett (Prince Charming), and Antonio Banderas, who steals the show as the swashbuckling accented feline. With such a talented cast working on good material, little is expected to go wrong, and little does from a vocal perspective. The animation is definitely a step up from the original. Although ""Shrek 2"" isn't aiming for complete realism, the opening scene of a horse and rider looks amazingly good. The upgraded vivid colors continue throughout, and the character animators shine during a thunderstorm scene, as they properly portray effects of water. This isn't ""Final Fantasy"" of course, but it does rank with the work of Pixar, the industry standard. When I say ""Shrek 2"" isn't a kids movie, I don't mean that kids won't like it, but I do mean that kids won't fully appreciate it in the way that many adults will. Those adults will still need to bring the kids in them to the movie, and with that in tow, they will be in for a rollicking two hours.Bottom Line: Edgier than the original, but just as enjoyable, at least for adults. A low 8/10.",Shrek 2
163,dhaufrect-1,Excellent Cartoon,8,16 February 2005,"""Shrek 2"" is an excellent cartoon. With the new computer generated images, this format is an enhancement on cartoons in general. Mike Myers plays the voice of Shrek once again. He is the ideal choice for this role. Eddie Murphy's voice is again a stroke of genius as the delightful donkey. Cameron Diaz is the voice of the Princess Fiona. Julie Andrews is the voice of the queen. Antonio Banderas gives a good boost to this movie with the clever voice of Puss In Boots. And John Cleese gives a believable interpretation of the voice of the king. The story is well organized. The music is catchy, and the overall effect is quite entertaining.

165,C22Man,Great sequel,8,27 September 2015,"It is never an easy task to follow up such a big hit as Shrek was, however Shrek 2 does a truly fantastic job and you would have a strong case to argue that it is even better than the original. Taking everything that was so enjoyable from the first film, it places it in a different situation and adds a new set of interesting characters to interact with. Whereas I felt that the original Shrek film was content with parodying fairy-tales and letting its characters craft the laughs, Shrek 2 ups the adventure and adds all different kinds of jokes in order to making everything seem bigger than before. This method can so easily fail, but I'm very pleased with how well it works here.This story is nothing new as Shrek and Fiona are summoned to Far Far Away to meet Fiona's parents who are the king and queen, and unsurprisingly Shrek and the king don't get along. Even the beats and events are nothing we haven't seen before, but it does them with such strong wit and style that it breathes new life into these tropes. But it quickly turns out that the Fairy Godmother plans to have her son marry Fiona as was originally foreseen. This is more of the same, but the idea to do it is very inventive. Shrek drinks a potion that turns him and Fiona human, which causes all kinds of issues. That is so creative and also a commendably brave decision in having the main character take on a different look for a lot of the film. I certainly think the strong characters are what make Shrek 2 so good. Shrek (with Mike Meyers' fun Scottish accent) is still the angry ogre, but his kind heart shines through. Donkey is again the comedic highlight thanks to his naivety and accidental annoyance while Eddie Murphy is simply perfect. Puss in Boots almost steals the film by bringing so much energy and by being a lovable presence. Both villains are a ton of fun. The Fairy Godmother (an excellent Jennifer Saunders) is as charismatic as she is evil and gets a lot of laughs, while Charming is an enjoyably vain and snooty. John Cleese and Julie Andrews are both superb as usual as the king and queen.As said the comedy is bigger and broader than before, with a great variety of jokes and nearly all of them work. The pop culture references littered throughout, the ironic use of fairy-tale heroines, all the villains hanging out at the 'Poison Apple' Inn and even the hilarious send up of Cops. Very few jokes fell flat and given how many there are that is quite impressive. The supporting fairy-tale characters, including Pinocchio and the Gingerbread Man, also make a welcomed return and provide plenty of laughs once again. The climax is outstanding. With nods to Ghostbusters and Mission: Impossible, it is both really funny and really exciting with some nice little twists thrown in too. The romance between Shrek and Fiona was another strong point of the film. I genuinely cared about their relationship and wanted to see them happy, while the predicament they are faced with at the end is gripping and it does send out a very good message. The animation is very vibrant and energetic, fitting the fast paced comedy and even allows for some good atmosphere when needed. Even the smaller details such as the backgrounds are very well designed. I enjoyed the use of pop songs and all of the tracks used fitted in perfectly. The use of 'Holding Out for a Hero' in the climax and sung by the Fairy Godmother added even more drive to the scene.Simply put Shrek 2 is a fantastic sequel. It continues in the same vein as the original and builds on to it as any good follow-up should do. It was smart to use a plot line that was familiar and could be altered just enough to make it feel fresh. The animation and music were uniformly excellent as usual from DreamWorks. Again though I think it's the characters that make the film work so well. The originals are great yet again, whilst all of the new characters fit in effortlessly and offer gravitas as well as comedy. Shrek 2 succeeds just like the original.",Shrek 2

It's noticeably lacking in the more quiet and surpsisingly adult moments that made its predecessor so rewatchable. That's not to say that Shrek 2 is particularly juvenile, but the grit that made the first Shrek so memorable and, in my opinion, a masterpiece of animation, is gone. There are genuinely awe inspiring moments in that film, but there aren't really any here, competent as it is.That's not to say that this film is bad. The more Pop tone is still executed quite well and Shrek himself is a bit more fleshed out as a character than he was in the original. It's genuinely emotional stuff watching him put himself through the ringer emotionally, mentally and physically just to make Fiona happy. Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots is one of the best things to happen to the franchise (Ditto Rupert Everett as Prince Charming. The guy seriously knows how to play campy villains, what can I say?) and the Fairy Godmother makes for a truly sinister and despicable villain.

170,DanB-4,"Excellent, But Inferior to the Original",9,10 June 2004,"There are two things missing from Shrek 2 that the original had. The first is John Lithgow - what a great villain. Lord Farquaad made the movie with his arrogant, smarmy attitude, and the way he went about seemingly unaware of his height. The second is the sense of wonderment that the original gave us with its cutting edge animation. Shrek 2 has a little bit of ""been-there-done-that"" attached to it.The open scene is outstanding. Shrek and Fiona are newlyweds and enjoying there new life together. In a matter of minutes, the pop-culture references fly by. Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, The Little Mermaid, Jaws and even From Here to Eternity are parodied. Its quite wonderful.Shrek and Fiona receive notice that they are to travel to the land of Far Far Away to meet Fiona's parents, voiced by Julie Andrews and the immensely underused John Cleese. Donkey comes along for the ride and in the first act of the movie, provides nearly all the laughs. The villain this time around is the fairy godmother, who had hopes of her own son, the spoiled and whiny Prince Charming, marrying Fiona, and now wants things set straight.Of the new characters, the best is clearly Antonio Banderas' Puss-n-Boots, a swashbuckling Kitty that is a beautiful send up of his own turn as Zorro. The Fairy Godmother is given lots of cute quirks like an eating disorder, but I found her to be annoying.I attended Shrek 2 with my two youngest children, age 4 and 8, and they were thoroughly entertained. The movie was not as frightening as the original, and even though it brims with nudge-nudge jokes for the adults, there are plenty of gags for the kids. It will be a movie to see several times to catch all the little gags. For example, when King Harold is given the Love Potion to give to Fiona, there is a little ""IX"" (#9) on the bottle. Or the Land of Far Far Away's coffee shop, Farbucks, and the fact that there are two across the road from eachother.I would have to heartily disagree with anyone who feels that Shrek 2 is a better film than Shrek. It is not as funny, drags a bit and has a couple of complete klunker scenes (the giant gingerbread man). It is still better than most movies in the multi-plex circuit and most worthy of your $12. ***1/2 out of ****.",Shrek 2

The honeymoon is interrupted by a messengers sent by Fiona's parents who would like to meet her new husband and heir to the throne. So Shrek, Fiona, and their talking donkey(Eddie Murphy) take a trip to Fiona's hometown of Far Far Away Land and are welcomed to an array of confused townspeople and an unwelcoming king(John Cleese) and queen(Julie Andrews).The plot thickens when a fairy-god mother(Jennifer Saunders) gets involved with hopes of her son, Prince Charming(Rupert Everett) marrying Fiona. Shrek and Donkey journey to find a happy ending for everyone meeting a new friend named Puss in Boots(Antonio Banderas) along the way.Shrek was a fantastic animated comedy that all ages could enjoy. Shrek 2 is by no means any different. The same caliber of jokes and children-friendly humor is used throughout the movie. The same great satire on fairy tales is still the basis for the movie and is used in an entirely new and original situation that causes laugh out loud humor constantly. With its break-taking animation, the audience will certainly be awed with amazement and realism and with it's fantastic plot and lovable characters, many will find Shrek 2 to be an instant favorite.

Shrek and his beloved wife Fiona are torn apart in a plot by a wily Fairy Godmother (Saunders) to marry the princess off to her son, Prince Charming. Nevertheless, it is just a frame on which to hang a a hilarious sequence of spoofs and gags. Stealing the show is Antonio Banderas as Puss In Boots.P.S.

With pot shots at many recent blockbusters, I thought this didn't quite meet my expectations. Yes, it is funny and has some really hysterical movies but it wasn't as funny as I thought it would be.Banderas and Murphy are hilarious as expected but I wanted more from Ogre.

(Is a Baby Shrek next? And what about Ye Olde Fairy Godmother, is she really gone?

One night in Rome I had to look after my sister and 4 other kids and we watched Shrek 2. I haven't seen the first one so my knowledge of the series is limited.The storyline is Shrek had married Princess Fiona and are supposed to return to the castle to visit Fiona's parents. Standing in the way of a perfect marriage is The King, Prince Charming and Fairy Godmother. On Shrek's side is Fiona, his sidekick Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy), foe turned friend Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Bandaras), and a gang of storybook people like Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, 3 Blind Mice, 3 little pigs. Shrek will do anything to make Fiona love him so he drinks a magic potion to turn human, which Fairy Godmother uses to Charming's advantage in confusing Fiona to thinking Shrek is Charming. Shrek and his gang of fairy tale people storm the castle using a Stay Puff Marshmellow Man inspired huge Gingerbread Man to save his marriage with Fiona.Its a decent kids movie for what its worth. The message to the kids that everyone has their own beauty is brilliant and the voice overs are somewhat hilarious. Hard to see Antonio Bandaras to go from El Mariachi to Puss in Boots but it fit the character well. If you want to entertain the kids and watch a movie as a family, this is a great choice.9 out of 10 for a kids movie.",Shrek 2

A fun, worthy experience at the movies is laden with wonderful satire, music, and merriment, all in the delightful medium of fantasy. Here is a film which utilizes its fantasy genre and delves into various splendid delights with conviviality and innovation. Classic fairy tale components such as magic potions (an assortment for every inducement) and magic wands (transforming people into creatures and vice versa)produce a very enjoyable, laborious accomplishment of comedy-fantasy. The mean green ogre reputation of Shrek has been greatly compromised, as Shrek is now a compassionate, caring ogre with his own inconsistencies and hilarity's. Overall, a very enjoyable sequel which ranks as the best film I have seen this year thus far.We can definitely expect a Shrek 3 sometime soon, especially given this installment's phenomenal success.

181,flickershows,"""Another Whirlwind Adventure?"" Kind Of...",7,25 May 2004,"At least one animated film per year is worthy of the highest praise. One of the best cartoons of recent years, one of the very best films of 2001, and one of my favourite movies of the past few decades was the original 'Shrek'. Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney for DreamWorks and we finally got to see what kind of smart & hilarious film he was capable of spearheading in DreamWorks' animation department. A windfall at the box office ensured this sequel, which is a rock-solid movie in its own right. The first time out for the big, green ogre and his chums was definitely better, but 'Shrek 2' is still a happy piece of entertainment.So now Shrek and Fiona are married, they've returned to their lovely swamp, and Donkey is their own Kato Kaelin. Fiona's parents---the King and Queen of ""Far, Far Away"", which looks a lot like Beverly Hills---want to meet their ogre-in-law (although they expect Prince Charming). In fact, that jackass Charming himself mucks things up for our heroes, as does a malevolent Fairy Godmother. They both intend to knock Shrek out of the picture and let the Prince weasel into Fiona's heart. The unhappy King even pays Puss In Boots to whack the big guy, which doesn't go quite as planned. Fiona is hurt that her husband and father won't even try to get along. From there, as the ass says, ""Shrek and Donkey, off on another whirlwind adventure"".Mike Myers (Shrek), Eddie Murphy (Donkey), and Cameron Diaz (Fiona) are back. Antonio Banderas (Puss), John Cleese (King), Julie Andrews (Queen), Rupert Everett (Charming), and Jennifer Saunders (Godmother) have joined the cast of computer renderings. That sounds like a dynamite team, and they bounce off each other pretty well. Murphy's act isn't nearly as funny this time and the zing of the original movie just isn't there. Banderas is having a blast parodying his Zorro personality, though and his Puss character is a highlight. 'Shrek 2' does not fall flat on its face. I enjoyed myself and did plenty of chuckling.Still, it takes a long time for the truly funny stuff to get going. Eventually, Pinocchio, the Gingerbread Man, and some other ""fairy tale...things"" arrive to help out the good guys. Then the laughs are aplenty. The climax has a lot of stuff to sort out at once, but it's nice to see that no character is forgotten. I don't think you'll be very stunned by the ending, which is not much more than a rehash of the first film. All the same, tykes will enjoy themselves, their parents will too, and quick-eyed viewers will have a great time trying to spot the amazing detail that went into this project. Indeed, the animation is awesome. You should see 'Shrek 2'. I just wish it lived up to its famous name with a bit more daring and originality.",Shrek 2
182,mcsheehey,Better than the First,9,2 June 2007,"The first Shrek film was well-liked by most because it satyred fairy tales in a fun way, while keeping a good story and good special effects. The characters were fresh and original, and the voice-acting was top-notch. Still, the film had some serious kinks and became almost bland. The sequel learns from the mistakes of the first films and eliminates them while going a step further than the first film.In ""Shrek 2"", we find Shrek and Fiona living happily in the swamp while enjoying the relaxing life of being married, apart from the constant badgering of Donkey, who is all the more hilarious in this second installment. Pretty soon, Shrek and Fiona are requested to go off and visit Fiona's parents in the ""Land of Far, Far, Away"". The set-up is priceless. We get similar spoofing of fairy tales all throughout the film, including stabs at Prince Charming, the ""Fairy god-mother"", the little mermaid (briefly), the frog prince, and thousands of others. The plot is much more well-thought out and original this time, and the story pokes fun at modern society and film, as well as the same kind of bits from the original. For instance, Far Far Way is the home of its very own News Team, some of the assistants of the Fairy Godmother complain about lack of insurance, and Starbucks locations are everywhere! These are only some of the many funny satirical bits in this film.What really makes ""Shrek 2"" the best in the series however, is that it balances all of its parts perfectly. The soundtrack is superb, the modern satirical bits are hilarious, the characters are all unique in their own way, and the plot is decent at worst, but in the hands of the wrong person this could have all meant nothing. It does. The film is a gem, better even for teens than for children. It is a flawless satire with fantastic animation and voice acting.",Shrek 2

Shrek is definitely one of the best family movies of all-time but can Shrek 2 out-do Shrek? Well, the story is a great story and it's definitely on par with the first movie. The characters are yet again lovable as well as the added characters such as Puss In Boots and the evil Fairy Godmother. The cast are yet again perfect for their characters and makes the movie so much more funnier. The writing and the script is brilliant and the jokes and funny scenes are just as funny as the first movie. Shrek 2 may not be as good or as original as the first Shrek but with Shrek 2's brilliant characters and hilarious jokes, it's fantastic in its own right and is definitely up there with the first movie.I loved the second Shrek just as much as the first one, maybe a bit more. I do honestly think that it's a fantastic family movie and it's guaranteed to make you laugh in all the right places. The voice acting really does add some brilliance to the movie. Antonio Banderas as Puss In Boots and Eddie Murphy as Donkey are both hilarious when they're together and Jennifer Saunders as the Fairy Godmother was just fantastic. All in all, Shrek 2 is a total success. I think that it's better than the first movie in my opinion, it's funnier with some fantastic characters added with brilliant voice acting.

If you want to say this film is one of the best comedies of all time then I'd say, you're right. This involves many clever jokes and puns dedicated to other animated films. I'm sure the people at DreamWorks were having a blast when coming up with many of the jokes. But this isn't a full blown comedy, it also mixes in some adventure, and a story about acceptance. Another character that really gained some popularity from this film is Puss in Boots. A Zorro type cat with boots and a sword, and a ferocious attitude. But his secret weapon is what people love the most. He's a bunch of smart character traits rolled into one. Antonio Banderas is the perfect casting for the character.

In particular, the movie takes some very well aimed swipes at Starbucks, E!, and COPS.  I think there may have been a few more, but those were the ones that really stand out at the moment.I felt that the production, cast, music-wise, and comically was as strong as the previous movie.  But, I think the story was a little less cohesive and there were one or two minor holes in the story.  But, all in all, the movie was a lot of fun and great bang for the buck.

190,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Shrek 2,9,19 May 2004,"Over in France, the controversial, and increasingly robust, Michael Moore is premiering his latest crap-trap, Fahrenheit 9/11, and judging by the mainly mixed reviews the documentary has received it seems President George W. Bush won't lost much sleep once this film premieres in the United States. But there is another film that is causing quite a few headaches for another high profile individual, namely Michael Eisner. That film is the highly anticipated, and rigorously promoted, sequel to Academy Award winning animated flick, Shrek. When the original fairy tale parody launched into theaters in 2001, numerous long-standing and highly devoted Disney followers rejected the film outright for its bashing of the company's fairy-tale feature film characters as well as its theme parks and company's CEO/Chairman but times have changed, so has the status of the company itself. Now Disney followers are lining up and penning out for the Dreamworks' animated feature to catch the latest inside Disney jabs. Why? How about you ask the 43% of Disney company stockholders who withheld their vote for Michael Eisner. Should Shrek 2 be proven a box office bonanza like the last one, or more so this time, then it would only add more fuel to the fire that Eisner is standing under now.The story picks up where the last film left off with the hideous ogre discovering the goodness within himself and finding true love at last. You would think they would happily ever after with that whole ordeal of the fire breathing dragon and pompous prince behind them, right? Not so fast! Shrek and Fiona barely cross the threshold when a messenger arrives to announce that the happy couple has been invited to the kingdom of Far, Far Away to attend a celebration hosted by Fiona's parents, the king and queen. Shrek is reluctant to go believing that once her parents see both of them in their less then flattering forms, they will refuse to give them their blessing but Fiona forces him to go and when they arrive . What do you know?! Shrek was right! In fact, the king is so upset that he hires a sleazy hit-man, Puss In Boots, to eliminate the caring ogre. And he isn't the only one after Shrek . so is the Fairy Godmother who's son was suppose to marry Fiona before the green one himself got there first. Now Shrek is willing to do anything, even if it means no longer being his old grungy, rude ogre self again, in order to make Fiona happy and live happily ever after. The story for Shrek 2 may seem a tad on the predictable side but the filmmakers throw in the right amount of catchy song-and-dance numbers and fairy-tale wisecracks to more then make up for the innovative story line. It runs at just the right pace and never tends to lag more then a few moments that you'll want more of the film once it ends.With the three main voice stars from the original film receiving $10 million paychecks to reprise their roles in the sequel, the film has obviously proven to have a star-studded group of voice-actors but with brand new ones joining in, can the sequel still maintain the edge that it did in the original? One major complaint from the first film was aimed at Mike Myers, who voiced the lovable green ogre, Shrek. It wasn't Myers' fault exactly or the character, it was just that the work that Myers did in the film wasn't all that funny compared to either Eddie Murphy or other parts of the film. No one need fear of a repeat in this film as Myers is given a vastly expanded script role in this go-around and delivers numerous comical moments in the film. But the biggest laughs once again come from Eddie Murphy as the likeable, if not often annoying, Donkey. Murphy's voice-over performance is one of the bigger highlights of the film and he is able to improve on the character slightly to make him funnier then he was in the original film, which hard for any voice-over performer to do. Vast praise is to be given to the other big highlight of the film, Antonio Banderas, who voices Puss In Boots. What could have been a one trick pony, Banderas' voice-over, as well as the humorous situations the character is placed in (`We found catnip' . `That's not mine!'), turn Puss In Boots into another delightful and memorable animated character with quick-witted personality that every child in the audience will enjoy seeing on screen. And Jennifer Saunders is fiendishly villainous as the Fairy Godmother, one you would think would be on the side of justice and right . But then again, this is Shrek's world we're talking about here! The best sequence comes near the end of the film with her singing `Holding Out for a Hero' and the comical events that unfold thereafter with all of it timed perfectly.Overall, Shrek 2 is quite possibly one of the biggest surprises of the summer, if not the year, and is a sight for sore eyes for those vastly disappointed by both Van Helsing and Troy at this point of the summer season. The plot of the film is the most notable problem as it tended to be quite predictable especially as the film went on but, as it was previously stated, the filmmakers present the whole story in such a wonderful and humorous way that it doesn't seem to matter all that much by the end. Another small problem is the beginning of the film which starts off kind of slow and isn't as funny as the rest of the film but once things get going (around the scene where Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey travel to Far, Far Away) the feature begins to pick up pretty quickly there after. Though this isn't a huge recommendation for the film, as one can just as easily go to the music store and listen to it at home, the soundtrack which features several catchy songs, some of which are new versions of old favorites, is a big plus as much as the original film's was. Shrek 2 is one of the rare gems of the movie world . a highly touted sequel that actually lives up to the hype that it receives and surpasses even the enormously high expectations set by the original. Another rare feat this film achieves is being enjoyable family feature appropriate for the whole family, an accomplishment that is so rarely achieved outside of the realm of Disney/Pixar fare. There are some suggestive jokes within the film but most will probably fly right over the heads of young children, so it isn't anything to worry about on the part of the parents. Though it isn't perfect, Shrek 2 is sure to remain one of the most pleasant family films of the year and for that reason alone it should be one of the must-see films of the season.My Rating: **** ½ out of 5 (Grade: A-)",Shrek 2

But the biggest laughs once again come from Eddie Murphy as the likable, if not often annoying, Donkey. Murphy's voice-over performance is one of the bigger highlights of the film and he is able to improve on the character slightly to make him funnier then he was in the original film, which hard for any voice-over performer to do. Vast praise is to be given to the other big highlight of the film, Antonio Banderas, who voices Puss In Boots. What could have been a one trick pony, Banderas' voice-over, as well as the humorous situations the character is placed in ('We found catnip'  'That's not mine!'), turn Puss In Boots into another delightful and memorable animated character with quick-witted personality that every child in the audience will enjoy seeing on screen. And Jennifer Saunders is fiendishly villainous as the Fairy Godmother, one you would think would be on the side of justice and right  But then again, this is Shrek's world were talking about here! The best sequence comes near the end of the film with her singing 'Holding Out for a Hero' and the comical events that unfold thereafter with all of it timed perfectly.Overall, Shrek 2 is quite possibly one of the biggest surprises of the summer, if not the year, and is a sight for sore eyes for those vastly disappointed by both Van Helsing and Troy at this point of the summer season. The plot of the film is the most notable problem as it tended to be quite predictable especially as the film went on but, as it was previously stated, the filmmakers present the whole story in such a wonderful and humorous way that it doesn't seem to matter all that much by the end. Another small problem is the beginning of the film which starts off kind of slow and isn't as funny as the rest of the film but once things get going (around the scene where Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey travel to Far, Far Away) the feature begins to pick up pretty quickly there after. Though this isn't a huge recommendation for the film, as one can just as easily go to the music store and listen to it at home, the soundtrack which features several catchy songs, some of which are new versions of old favorites, is a big plus as much as the original film's was. Shrek 2 is one of the rare gems of the movie world  a highly touted sequel that actually lives up to the hype that it receives and surpasses even the enormously high expectations set by the original. Another rare feat this film achieves is being enjoyable family feature appropriate for the whole family, an accomplishment that is so rarely achieved outside of the realm of Disney/Pixar fare. There are some suggestive jokes within the film but most will probably fly right over the heads of young children, so it isn't anything to worry about on the part of the parents. Though it isn't perfect, Shrek 2 is sure to remain one of the most pleasant family films of the year and for that reason alone it should be one of the must-see films of the season.My Rating: **** ½ out of 5 (Grade: A-)",Shrek 2
192,husnain_05,This should have won more awards then Shrek.,9,10 December 2005,I was quite relieved when I found out that Shrek 2 had won less awards then Shrek because I found Shrek 2 better.My family including my brother who is 30 years old.shrek2 2 is a fabulous movie that contains a different genre to Shrek which is music.This is one of my top 10 films.This one is my 8th favourite film and I know that it is my nephews favourite film. I like the film Eloise at Christmas time and it was nice to hear Eloises nannies voice in this film as the evil fairy godmother who wants Fiona to marry her son Prince Charming who is also bad but Shrek and Donkey come to the rescue and save her from the evil in the film.,Shrek 2

194,MisterSisterFister,Why is Shrek So Popular?,4,6 November 2018,"I've never understood the fuss over the Shrek films. They're basically just a series of okay, sometimes irritating, movies that immediately dated themselves the moment upon release. How many times are they gonna crowbar in a Smash Mouth song? How many times are they gonna unnecessarily parody films that were new at the time? Good animated films are timeless, whereas Shrek is nothing more than a product of its time that deserves to fall into the ""Oh, yeah, I forgot they made those"" category of memory.",Shrek 2

197,rbsjrx,"Still good, but the new has worn off",8,21 May 2004,"I just saw ""Shrek 2"" and left feeling vaguely let down. There could be several reasons for this that had nothing to do with the film. For one thing, I saw a non-opening day weekday matinee, so there was very small audience - not good for a comedy. For another, I simply wasn't in the greatest of moods.Still, after ruminating on it for a while, I have decided that it really didn't impress me as much as the original. The original ""Shrek"" had the benefit of surprise and discovery, which any sequel will lack. Still the humor was well executed with every bit as much detail as the original, so why wasn't I more impressed? I can think of several possibilities which I'll detail below. Overall, I can recommend it, though. Oh, and by all means, stay for the credits!!![WARNING - Potential spoilers from here on]1. ""Shrek 2"" is self-consciously more hip than the original. The original has lots of contemporary references, to be sure, but not so many as to make it inaccessible to audiences some number of decades in the future. This one did and it detracted from the impact.2. The plot line having Shrek and Fiona both made human just seemed wrong. Granted, this was a goal - to show the folly of trying to be something you're not - but still, a human Shrek just didn't deliver the goods the way the ogre Shrek could have.3. The big surprises at the end were obvious from very early in the film. Granted that big surprise ending in ""Shrek"" was also somewhat predictable, but still I saw of the revelations coming from a mile away, as will I expect most viewers.4. ""Shrek"" resisted the feature-length cartoon urge to include musical numbers. ""Shrek 2"" gives in and the results are mixed, at best.Now that I've got the carping out of the way, I still admit that, on balance, it was pretty good. I mean, I didn't leaving wanting my money or time back. Some of the best gags are subtle and take place in the periphery of the main action (check out the label on the love potion). The cast and animators did their typically superb job. I can hardly wait to see what extras will appear on the DVD version...",Shrek 2
198,colettesplace,If only all animation films directed at children were this good...,8,17 December 2004,"Shrek 2's writing and directing team prove they haven't run out of ideas in this pacy, hilarious feature  which manages to deliver a positive message without being saccharine. The film's is a delight from start to finish  with the finest cast ever to grace an animation feature. Following on from the 2001 box office smash Shrek 1, Shrek (Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are now married and head off to meet her parents in The Land of Far Away  accompanied by Eddie Murphy's Donkey of course. John Cleese and Julie Andrews play Fiona's parents, the King and Queen of Far Away. Far Away's a parody of Hollywood  it's fast-paced and fake and even has its name spelled out in giant letters. The CGI is more sophisticated three years on, and we have better villains: Jennifer Saunders is perfectly cast as an Ab Fab-inspired fairy godmother  heading up a giant fairy corporation  with a sulky Rupert Everett as her son, the Prince Charming that was supposed to marry Princess Fiona. And the Gingerbread Man's back, as are the debonair blind mice. But the pick of this cast has to be Antonio Banderas, in the role of his life, Puss in Boots. This feisty, manipulative cat  and his banter with Donkey  is the highlight of the film.Shrek 2 is recommended for all ages, and a must-see for the big screen. But if you haven't seen Shrek 1, watch it first to whet your appetite. Four stars",Shrek 2
199,meissotruey,Problems with originality,7,7 September 2020,"I would rate this movie 9 if it was made in RU dub, cause quality text,

200,richard-pullen-1,Shrek 2,7,5 October 2004,"Not a fan of 'Shrek', not a fan at all ... In fact I hated it! I think it was one of the most over rated films I've seen! Mike Myers wasn't funny.I saw improvement in 'Shrek 2' ... But not in the vocal ability of Mike Myers but I saw improvement in the script. The jokes and references were much better.But what the hell was putting Kate Thornton's voice in the U.K version all about!?! She's not exactly liked by the masses when she's actually on television! I saw logic in Jonathan Ross but not Thornton!Anyway. The kids will love 'Shrek 2' I have NO doubts the majority of planet Earth will love it too... But it wasn't all that in the end!",Shrek 2
201,andrewtisler,"Even more ""Shrek-tacular"" than the first film!",10,22 October 2021,"""Shrek"" is one of my favorite movies of all-time, not just because it's a DreamWorks Animation movie, but because it overall is fantastic, full of great animation, solid voice acting, well-done humor, and an intriguing story, simultaneously catering to both children and adults. With ""Shrek 2"", an even more intriguing story and characterizations are put into play, and it all works very well for both DreamWorks and the animation industry overall.Carrying on from where the first film ended, Shrek and Fiona are invited by Fiona's parents King Harold and Queen Lillian to attend a royal ball in Fiona's birth kingdom Far Far Away. Along with Shrek's annoying but good-natured best friend Donkey, the married ogres set out to the Hollywood-style kingdom in their onion coach to meet the parents of the most wonderful princess in the world. However, after arriving in the kingdom, Harold and Lillian do not welcome Shrek into their lives as much as the ogre thought. To make a turn for the worse, Fiona's old love interest Prince Charming, son of the powerful Fairy Godmother, is plotting to overthrow Harold and become the new king of Far Far Away, and so Harold hires a Spanish-accented version of Puss in Boots to exterminate Shrek, only for him to turn against his orders and help Shrek become human so Fiona won't marry Charming. The story of ""Shrek 2"" is amazing, and the humor is as spot on as it was in the first.I absolutely love the new characters in this movie, especially Puss in Boots. His latin charisma and flamboyant personality makes him a scene-stealer among the film's supporting cast. Plus Antonio Banderas' voice is very fitting for a cat that behaves like Zorro, a character Banderas once played onscreen in 1998 (interestingly, the same year DreamWorks Animation's first film ""Antz"" was released).The animation is even more outstanding than the first movie's, showing a steady growth for DreamWorks' technology. The colors, details, and character designs show a significant improvement in visual style that helps to represent what this fairytale world is built upon.Oh, and let's not forget the music. It is incredible how the filmmakers were able to add in almost every single popular tune of the time into this feature, especially when Jennifer Saunders (the voice of Fairy Godmother) covers Bonnie Tyler's ""Holding Out for a Hero"". That was one of the best parts of the movie!""Shrek 2"" is by far even more ""Shrek-tacular"" than the first film, and one of DreamWorks Animation's greatest animated movies ever made! A definite recommend for the whole family!!!!!!!!!!! 10/10!",Shrek 2
202,Scorching,Good film but not as great as the first!,7,22 May 2004,"The cast of Shrek returns for another adventure. Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy) reprise their roles and are joined by Antonio Banderas, John Cleese and Julie Andrews. Shrek and Fiona are invited by her parents to a ball to celebrate their marriage. But to her parent's surprise their daughter is a still an Ogre and has even married one!It is always a challenge for filmmakers to come up with a sequel that at the very least comes close to it's predecessor. So many great films have come up with substandard follow-ups which in a way has tainted it's great reputation. Well it looks like you need not add the name of Shrek to that rather dubious list.I thought the animators of Dreamworks did a great job once again in terms of coming up with a quality animation picture. The visuals were so good that sometimes you actually forget that you are watching an animated film. The very colourful visuals and stunning detail makes you appreciate the painstaking work of the animators over the many months.I thought the story was much better and deeper than the first movie. The story more complex than the first. You are able to see more of the personality of the main character his strengths, and his insecurities.I think because of the relatively intricate story line that it contributed to the movies being less funny. The few funny scenes were mostly made by Donkey and Prince Charming. Shrek I felt was a lot more serious in this film and his occasional wisecracks didn't do it for me. Also some greats cameos by Larry King as the Ugly Stepsister and Joan Rivers. Don't get me wrong this is still a funny movie but it pales to the original.
Great film not as good at first but a good film nonetheless. Well I heard that they are already working on Shrek 3 and I'm looking forward to it already.",Shrek 2

When I walked out I had forgotten everything bad that had happened that day.I'm not a big fan of the first Shrek - I thought it was a little dry and the story could have been played out better. But this sequel is much better in my opinion. Shrek 2 offers a lot more than the first Shrek. There's plenty of laughs for the kids and adults, and the story is ten times more heartfelt than its predecessor.They throw in new characters as well. The adventurous Puss in Boots - a silly spin-off of Zorro, Fiona's Fairy Godmother - the authority on a 'happily ever after' ending, 'Prince Charming' and much more. Sometimes new characters tend to do a pathetic job keeping a movie series alive, but not in Shrek 2. I was happy to see some fresh comedy along with all the new faces, and lots of hilarious parodies on other films as well. The whole movie I was smiling and having a great time.This is a great date, family, and friends movie. If you're looking for a good time at the theater, or just in general, go see Shrek 2!

Shrek-Donkey duo was less at first but we had great bits of them in 2nd half.Thank you for focusing on the relation of Shrek-Fiona and carrying the story forward with great their mix of parents. The villains were better in this film and a great twist of Charming taking over Shrek's place. Price Charming is as charming as he can get. The father had a nice arc with a great backstory,frog, which ties everything nicely.The ending action sequence is better in this film, for that giant gingerbread. Some great humor of course with Eddie Murphy's donkey, the pinocchio thong had me rolling.The movie again tackles beauty issues and it was well presented, it didn't felt they were pasting from first film but was actually showing natural progression of characters.One of the best sequels ever made, carries what made past film great and increase them for more greatness.",Shrek 2

Having seen the first film and being very pleased with what I saw I knew it would be hard to match it, but this more than matches it and completely surpassed my expectations. There were huge laughs in the cinemas throughout and it never looks like getting boring so i'm glad Shrek 3 and 4 are in the works. In Both movies Diaz, Myers and Murphy have done fantastic jobs and Banderas is a welcome addition to this excellent film. The graphics, one liners and spoofs are also very funny and it really does make you leave the cinema with a smile on your face. Overall this film must be seen by everyone and I can now see why it has been so successful worldwide!",Shrek 2
209,katydid4819,Shrek Under Pressure,8,25 September 2004,"Shrek, the original was a breakout success that had audiences coming back again and again to see if it really was as good as they seemed to remember it. Shrek 2 has all the elements that made the first so entertaining.The cast is lead by Mike Myers who so inhabits his character that you don't realize that it's Austin Powers in another of his quirky voices that is making the kids laugh so much. He has become one of the great characters of the last decade: Shrek, that lovable green ogre that we all can relate to on one level or another. And of course, where would we be without the trusty steed? Donkey is Eddie Murphy's only tolerable role since Dr. Doolittle. He steals the show with his obvious humor more than once, just as he did in the first. Cameron Diaz, also hiding well in her animated Fiona, is charming but has the most mundane dialogue of the movie. She also has given her character an attitude that was not there in the first and scenes with her are detracted from because of this unfortunate addition.The story line is weak in the beginning half of the movie. Actually, the whole script is. It seems like a by-the-book sequel and we wonder if this is worth the hype that's been around for weeks. By the second half (the 'adventure' half) the buzz has vindicated. The new jokes, aided by the pop culture humor, are more original than any other animated movie. In the end, we get what we knew was going to happen (well, Ricky Martin wasn't expected) but that doesn't feel like a cheap, Hollywood ending because we new that when we saw the trailer. Once again, DreamWorks has scored a hit bigger than they expected. Of course this will mean an immediate green light for Shrek 3, 4, 5, etc. but that's all later and right now, Shrek 2 has held up under the expectation set by the first one. A fun, family film that, hopefully, is the perfect ending to an excellent set of movies. ***/*****",Shrek 2

When they return, Fiona receives a message from her parents, the King and Queen (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) of Far Far Away, summoning her to a ball honoring her and her groom. So the three of them pack up the onion carriage and head off on their long journey.When King Harold finds out what his baby girl married and what she's become, he hires Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas)--an assassin with a nasty case of hairballs--to whack Shrek, hoping she'll fall in love with Charming (who is anything but). But Shrek and Puss become fast friends, and plot a way to foil Fairy Godmother's (Jennifer Saunders) plan to force Fiona to marry Charming.There's more on-screen singing, most of which is performed by Murphy and Saunders. The finale is Murphy and Banderas, in character, singing ""La Vida Loca.""""Shrek 2"" continues to fire shots at Disney, but also skewers commercialism (Saxon Fifth Avenue), the Brothers Grimm, pop culture, ""Cops,"" and Hollywood (note the sign on the hillside), while giving its audience a new message: loving one's self.I didn't think the sequel could possibly hold a candle to ""Shrek,"" but I was wrong.

Also the inclusion of Puss in Boots and the participation of characters that in the first film are hardly used adds a lot of good humour to the film.

It isn't as funny as the first movie, and there are times that just don't fit in with the whole Shrek story. The ending was slightly disappointing, as they didn't end up the way I'd hoped.

215,the-evil-cult,A Good Movie that Appeals to Many,10,7 December 2004,"With a budget fifteen million dollars greater than that of the original, Shrek 2 needed to appeal to a large and diverse number of people to maximize viewer numbers. The better visual effects are appealing to all audiences but probably moreso to the younger ones. Movie references are littered through the movie to give movie fan a reason to like Shrek 2. Many movie fans enjoy picking out movie references. When a movie fan picks up on a reference, he or she usually likes to show off to others, and in the process of showing off he inadvertently advertises the movie even further.The theme or message of the movie is similar to the original. It is about imperfection, about not fitting with in the ideal image. Psychologists understand that what is common to many people is the desire to fit in and not be rejected. This applies not only to minorities but also to fat people, skinny people, ugly people, women trying to make it in the labor market, and many more groups. A vast proportion of the population has some form of characteristic that society deems a defect. Shrek 2 attempts to exploit the vastness of this psychological phenomenon by structuring its plot based on the steps that people typically take to gain acceptance among the dominant culture. Shrek the ogre feels embarrassed when he meets with the in-laws, so he tries to change himself. While conformity has its rewards, those who conform generally do not enjoy it. One typically exerts much effort to fully conform to an ideal image and to maintain it. The movie exploits the people's desires to throw away the shackles of conformity.A few picky reviewers mention that the plot is too ""convoluted."" This may be a valid criticism as a complex plot is certainly not going to be appealing. My opinion is that unless you are extremely intent on picking up flaws in the movie you probably won't notice this.The sequel grossed much more than the original (from memory it earned almost double as much). This may be due to the awareness created by the original Shrek. The sequel appealed to a variety of different people and to a variety of emotions. The movie did very well outside of the US as it did in the US, showing that the themes were universal rather than restricted to one location.",Shrek 2
216,tvalstar99,"Quite the same, but still good enough",6,29 June 2004,"Shrek 2 shows more of Shrek 1. It still deals around excepting yourself the way you are. This is a nice message, but maybe a little too much sometimes. Shrek 2 is a nice, sweet, funny movie. Just like Shrek 1. But it show more of the same. Not that that is too bad. There seem to be less jokes in this sequel. And the characters are not different of course, but the introduction of The Puss with Boots is very nice done and brings a nice, fresh new character. But I think his role should have been bigger. He has some very funny lines. Donkey is funny as ever. This movie is of course still worth watching. So, just go and watch this movie. You will enjoy yourself for sure. Trust me.",Shrek 2
217,Elgroovio,Better than the first one,7,9 July 2004,"I was not very impressed by the first ""Shrek"" film and was expecting the same sort of sentiments for the second film. But when I saw it (only yesterday as a matter of fact), I was pleasantly surprised to find it was better. As usual, Eddie Murphy is great as Donkey, but the show is completely stolen by Puss in Boots who is brought alive by the voice of Antonio Banderas. John Cleese, Julie Andrews, Rupert Everett and Jenniffer Saunders are among the new cast. There are some great gags and some wonderful spoofs of a number of films, one of the best spoofs being one of ""Mission Impossible"". But this film is no masterpiece; it suffers a bit from the same problems as ""Shrek (1)"": after a while it gets boring watching the two ogres farting and burping continuously. Still, it is worth seeing, even just for Puss in Boots. Enjoy. 7/10",Shrek 2
218,aa56,Screenplay-wise,7,26 March 2005,"this sequel is not as funny as Shrek. The writers should have included more comedy and much less of those immediately forgettable awful tunes. Did they insert that crap to make the movie a certain length? Was the film an audition for the actors to try to become singers? Another criticism is all of the continuity lapses. Come on! This is animation! It is relatively easy to review and fix bad continuity in an animated film! A strong point of the original Shrek was the antics of the fairytale creatures. Except for the attack on the castle, these were sadly downplayed. One improvement was Cameron Diaz' acting, as she admitted in the special feature. In the first Shrek, she sounded like someone reading her lines. In Shrek 2 she was more into the acting procedure. The computer graphics in this sequel set a new standard of excellence. They alone would make this movie highly recommended.",Shrek 2

220,LG72387,Fantastic,7,7 November 2004,"Shrek 2 is simply one of the best comedies of the year. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz are fantastic once again in the roles of Shrek, Donkey, and Princess Fiona. The writing is superlative and witty and the film itself is absolutely hilarious. It all begins when Shrek and Fiona are summoned to the magical kingdom of Far Far Away by Fiona's parents, who are appropriately titled the King and the Queen. It is apparent from the start of the film that Shrek and the King don't like each other and that no one seems to care about Fiona's feelings. There is also the appearance of a Fairy Godmother, who would seem to care about Shrek and Fiona but really doesn't. It turns out that she is the Fairy Godmother from Hell and she wants her son, Prince Charming, to marry Fiona instead of Shrek. That way, she can obtain more power for herself. As a result, the King and the Fairy Godmother hire an assassin called Puss in Boots to kill Shrek. The assassination attempt is perhaps one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a long time. Antonio Banderas is absolutely wonderful as Puss and should garner the same type of praise that Ellen Degeneres got for Finding Nemo. The story plays out with some other clever and totally funny sequences, including the appearance of a giant ginger-bread man named Mongo, and ends up with the King accepting Shrek and everything turning out to be happily ever after. The film is filled with great performances from John Cleese as the King, Julie Andrews as the Queen and Rupert Everett as Prince Charming. Shrek 2 is not as original as the first Shrek, but it comes pretty damn close. Lenny's Grade: A",Shrek 2

The plot mainly revolves around the secret deal between the King and the Fairy Godmother.

Even, Far Far Away looks very beautiful. Especially, the castle looks very beautiful. The forest looks very beautiful and wonderful. When, Puss in boots is fighting with Shrek, that time puss is very cool. At the beginning of the movie, there is a song called ""Accidentally in Love"" that song is totally awesome and cool.

224,Bondorf39,"""Be Yourself""",4,18 May 2005,"I am reminded of an old Disney TV special, in which Donald Duck tries to be a singer, a dancer, a juggler, lots of things he simply is not. Walt sticks him to some very sage advice: ""Be yourself."" I bring this up because this two word homily is but one of the thousands of lessons Dreamworks could learn from the House of Mouse.""Shrek 2,"" the annoyingly popular sequel to the irritatingly successful ""Shrek"" is a prime example of the serious condition that plagues all Dreamworks Animated Films: DERIVATIVITIS!!! The story of S2 is quite good. No, really, it is. Shrek and Fiona are newlyweds, and when they visit the Princess's parents, they are, to put it lightly, shocked to discover their daughter is an ogre. Their taunts get under Shrek's skin and he starts to think maybe Fiona would be better off with a prince. So he, Donkey and a newcomer, Puss (in Boots!) travel the countryside to make what they assume to be Fiona's dream come true. In the end, of course, they learn the importance of being yourself and that love conquers all, two very useful lessons, I think you'll find.And if that was what the movie was, it'd be great and I'd gladly show it to my hypothetical kids any day of the week. But the plot is incidental to the main reason they made this picture, which is to cram as many jokes, spoofs, takeoffs, lampoons, references and anti-Disney propaganda gags as they possibly can into 86 minutes of celluloid. And, frankly, it gets old!! Someone needs to tell these people that they don't need all this! They don't need ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"" jokes. They don't need pop culture references. They don't need poorly cast celebrity voices. They don't need popular singles to sell the soundtrack album. They don't need to over-market their movies. Just make movies! Tell your story. The occasional homage to one of your predecessors is understandable in animated film, but don't make that the point of the movie.Spielberg...Geffen...Katzenberg...just be yourselves!

The story of ""Shrek 2"" is just a well-made romance with a lot of fairy-tale characters. Not a fairy-tale. And don't expect the same wealth of humour as ""Shrek"" had. Of course it's pretty watchable and still even have something to remember but it's not THAT, you know what I mean.

My favorite scene must've been the commercial for ""Knights"", a parody on the popular TV show ""Cops"".Everything is brilliantly made. With voice actors like Carmen Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, plus SFX and GFX by Pixar, there is absolutely NOTHING to complain about on the audiovisual side. The script is well written, and when you deal with animated actors, there is not much that CAN be done wrong in the directing. The colors are just as beautiful as in Shrek 1 and follows the same color scheme, with a lot of green and red-pink-purple in shimmering, psychedelic, fairy-tale shades.The humor is of course also brilliant. This ISN'T a movie for kids, the animators were adults making a movie to be enjoyed by other adults. Some of the humor won't be comprehended by your children, and if you're a conservative right-wing Christian, you might have some difficulty explaining to them why everyone else in the movie theater is laughing.

But this movie really did not live up to theoriginal.  It was almost too stuffed with funny anecdotes.  It wasmanic in pace, and when a coffee-holic makes a comment likethat...well...let's just say I usually am very alert.  The pace was alittle too much for me.  I wasn't as thrilled with the second movie asthe first.  But overall, it was a good movie.  I still gave it a 6 out of10.  The writing was great, but not excellent like the first movie. The story line was great, but not excellent like the first movie.  Thescenery was excellent, and it was really better than the first movie. The landscapes were really lush.

The one-liners are hilarious and the scenes between Myers and Murphy have the same funny charm as in the original. A new character, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is a very welcome addition; he gets the funniest lines and Banderas out-performs every last one of the other voice-actors. I loved this character! The movie itself is a little disappointing compared to the original. The plot, concerning Shrek having to prove his worth for Fiona to her fairy godmother, is a bit of a letdown.

238,cs100,Pixar still tops Dreamworks for all-ages family fare,5,7 July 2004,"My rating:  5/10Shrek 2's target audience, unfortunately, doesn't fit my family's profile: my girls (7 and 3) are too young. For kids to appreciate Shrek 2 (or even for them not to experience a certain revulsion towards the character Shrek), they need to be older and slightly cynical, at least towards the prototypical Disney ""and they lived happily ever after"" fairy tale movies. However, even pre-teenage children will only capture a fraction of the references to popular culture and 20 year-old movies that pervade Shrek 2. Therefore, I submit that the target audience for Shrek 2 is a pair of pop culture saturated parents, and their post-Disney kids.Since I'm not saturated with pop culture, I didn't get anywhere near all the references in Shrek 2. But even those that I did get, such as the Stay-Puft marshmallow man of Ghostbusters' fame, and Joan Rivers dishing out her commentary at the Academy Awards, were not exactly side-splitting funny. Amusing, yes, and Shrek 2 had its moments. But to me it felt like much of it was formulaic, and aimed at the true pop culture sophisticate.Pixar, by contrast, has proven repeatedly that they know how to develop funny, warm computer animated movies that truly can be appreciated by all ages. Most all the Pixar films are classics that will still be viewed 20 years from now, whereas by then, Shrek 2 will have faded from memory.",Shrek 2
239,Perdicus,Brilliant!,10,8 June 2004,"Very few sequels are as good as the original, but ""Shrek 2"" is one of them. It's a great movie right from the beginning, where we see Prince Charming enter Dragon's castle, and is very disappointed to find the Wolf* instead of Princess Fiona. It's ""another whirlwind adventure"" from there, as Shrek and Fiona's love is tested to the limit by the scheming Fairy Godmother and her narcissistic son (Prince Charming). Also, Donkey is faced with unexpected competition in the ""best friend/annoying talking animal"" category from Puss-in-Boots. Of course, they all (eventually) live happily ever after.*This Wolf apparently does double duty, combining certain traits from ""Little Red Riding Hood"" (cross-dressing) and ""The Three Little Pigs"" (super-powerful lungs).

It slumps along to played out pop music, without really taking any direction or making any choices.Now that i've vaugely repeated myself enough.  The third act is really funny and works incredibly well.  Shrek, at it's best is a tounge-in-cheek reference to the intersection of pop-culture and fairy tales.  At it's worst, it's cliched and uninteresting.  The picture finally picks up in 3rd act with quick with, fast paced (real) humor, and also a little bit of poppy-sugary-sweetness.Ultimatley, the last act can and should never be able to redeem the rest of the movie, and it certainly doesn't here.

244,Hawley_Griffin,"""The position of annoying talking animal has been filled.""",4,2 August 2004,"I've always been curious about ""Shrek"". The first movie was praised beyond belief, went to Cannes and was regarded as a great example of a sense of humour that was rarely seen on mainstream animation. For one reason or another, I never saw that movie. Just this year a ""Shrek""-loving girlfriend dragged me to see the sequel ... and it's nothing short of awful.Apparently, by the end of the original ""Shrek"", both the green ogre and the Princess Fiona are living happily in the swamp, until they get an invitation from Fiona's parents. This seems to foresee a series of intelligent, double entendre joke that finally arrive, but too late, when we are painfully aware of how lame and predictable they were. Then the movie gets lost in a meandering plot, and I mean meandering in a very bad way. Some hope arises with Puss with Boots, played by Antonio Banderas. He gets some real, honest laughs for a change but he's still just one secondary character, and the screenwriters seems more concerned with making a thousand movie spoofs a minute than with having a good array of supporting characters. A good movie spoof, well timed and appropriate, can be wonderful. But in ""Shrek 2"" they are placed constantly in a way that's just too annoying. If that is what is so innovating about its jokes, then, well, it sucks.Also, the voice cast is just badly used and it shows a decidedly strong tendence to show off the quality and the high-browness of the production, instead of doing actual comedy. Julie Andrews stars as the Queen, a role that could've been played by absolutely anyone with the ability to speak, since it has no real development and her only moment in the limelight is at the end, just so she can get tender and leave a good moral to the kids. And what is it with hiring John Cleese to do, well, nothing special, like in the Harry Potter movies? And what is it with John Cleese accepting? Why can't I laugh my dear ass off with Cleese like in the Monty Python years.This is just bad. Towards the ending it gets mildly amusing, with Shrek turned into a Bruce Campbell look-alike in a scene that features some solid jokes for a change. Of course, it's all set so the filmmakers can do a ""Ghostbusters"" satire in the meantime, combined with an ""E.T."" and a ""Godzilla"" joke.Just lame.",Shrek 2

But if all sequels were as good as Shrek 2, I would go see all of them.Things did start out a bit on the slow side.  There were several new characters to introduce, and how they fit into the story had to be established.  Once this was done, the movie picked right up.  I was laughing so hard in some places I scared my 18 month old daughter, who was sitting next to me and enjoying the film more than her popcorn.  Think about that too.

There's plenty of fun, plenty of references to all sorts of films and tales, there's a puss in boots and it talks besides other things. The plot doesn't really demand much of our attention but then again neither did Shrek. The CGI is shrekalicious and leaves little to be desired. It doesn't not want to be photo realistic so please do not expect any Gollum CGI stuff, besides the lighting and animations are fantastic. This is a comic book like fun fairy tale ride, fast paced - are we there yet - at times and chock full with good music.The voices of Mike and Eddie are complemented yet again by sexy Diaz and Antonio ""Puss"" Banderas! Simply hilarious. Again, I recommend you go see the original, e.g. in comparison the German voices leave a lot to be desired.It doesn't bring anything ""new"" it's ""just"" more Shrek, but then again that's exactly what you should expect and exactly what you will get.

Maybe my expectations were simply too high. Maybe pop-culture references alone cannot a great film make. Just because there happens to be a ""Farbucks"" store - obvious reference to Starbucks - does not necessarily mean it's funny. ""Shrek 2"" perhaps relies too much on such references and loses its heart and originality. The humor is much more 'adult' than in the first Shrek, though the kids are not likely to get it. In fact, ""Shrek 2"" is probably funnier overall for adults than its younger target audience. For that I commend it. Please the parents while entertaining the children.

IMHO: it could have been scrapped. Where Du Loc's barbs at Disney were sharp (and quickly over) in the first, the second movie goes on and on (and on...) about the LA lifestyle or something. Yeah, the Farbucks joke was funny, and some of the signs were worth a chuckle, but the red carpet gags and endless ""LA is shallow"" bit was boring. It just all went over the kids' heads, and it didn't sink the film.OK, that out of the way, the rest of the movie was everything that it needed to be to live up to the first while continuing on with the tale. Puss in Boots wasn't as awesome to me as he was to everyone else, apparently, but different tastes and all that. The story was sweet without being sugary. The ""villians"" weren't the crazy ""take-over-the-world"" sort, they had motivations and character. The good guys were good, the action was fun and even Eddie Murphy (who's act has really started to wear thin for yours truly) was worth having along. The CGI is definitely a notch up, the jokes (outside of the above) were funny. I laughed quite a bit and I know there were bits in the background that I missed (especially in the Poison Apple Bar).

That is really all I can say, It deserved the oscar for best Animated Picture, but the oscars are retarded (Parasite did deserve best picture in 2020 though) so yeah lol. This film will amaze anyone who will watch it, Watch it with your cat, your dog, your ghost of the slave that the former person who lived in the house owned, your mom, your dad, your imaginary friend, Watch this ASAP.

256,JekyllBoote-1,A morally and aesthetically abhorrent form of child abuse,1,29 May 2008,"The whole Shrek franchise is thoroughly abhorrent, both morally and aesthetically.It tries to have things two mutually inconsistent ways: to create a fairytale scenario while parodying and guying the whole fairytale genre (thus creating the kind of brats who are cynical before they have had the opportunity to be innocent). It is also coarse and ugly (with the post-Punk relish in such wilful ugliness).The Disney studio produced sugar-coated travesties of the central-European tradition of story-telling, but these were at least often accompanied by musical scores of some attractiveness (and musical literacy); Shrek is happy to recycle substandard versions of middle-of-the-road rock and soul staples.To subject your children to this trash is child abuse; to subject yourself to it....",Shrek 2
257,smit815,Fantastic,10,25 May 2004,It is hard to believe but Shrek 2 is better and funnier than the first. The humor was quick and truly unique. I had the best laughs that I have had in years.My favorite charcters were the 3 blind mice and Pinnochio. As always Eddie Murphy was a stand out.Of course the fairy godmother as treacherous is a new concept. And Prince Charming as self absorbed is refrshing.I did feel the music was a little strained in its use and was better used in the first shrek. This movie has something for every age - bith kids and parents will enjoy this movie.Andy,Shrek 2
258,parkecha,A whole lot better than the original!,10,19 May 2019,"So I wasn't really a huge fan of Shrek (2001). I thought that movie was ogre-rated, and it had a weak villain. However, Shrek 2 is actually the only Shrek movie that I'd rate 10/10. This movie is actually a surprisingly great movie. The climax is absolutely brilliant, the villain is a lot better than Lord Farquaad, there are some pretty funny scenes. Puss In Boots is a pretty hilarious and great character. This is the only Shrek sequel, and even the only Shrek movie that I actually really loved. Good job DreamWorks!",Shrek 2
259,regertz,Shrek II excellent,10,30 May 2007,"An excellent sequel that carries on the tradition of the first bringing several new and well-thought-out characters, particularly the delightful and delightfully wicked Fairy Godmother and the charming Zorro takeoff Puss-in-Boots. A happily married Shrek and Fiona are invited to her home kingdom of Far, Far Away by her parents who've no idea their plan for ending the princess' ogre-by-night curse has taken an unexpected turn. Shrek with forebodings of disaster reluctantly is persuaded to go, Donkey, undergoing some problems in his relationship with Dragon, hitches a ride, and the story moves us to the Beverly Hills-like kingdom of Far, Far Away where Fiona's parents King Harold and Queen Lillian are not exactly delighted to meet their new ogre-in-law.The original plot is deepened by offering details of how and why Fiona was locked away in her tower and the secret of her curse ends up being revealed in hilarious fashion at the end. Rupert Everett narrates a charming repeat of the fairy tale that opened the first Shrek and gives a great turn as the vain and rather nasty Prince Charming. Antonio Bandaras has great fun spoofing his Zorro character as the heroic if somewhat limited by his feline condition, Puss-in-Boots. But the show is stolen by the arrival of the Godmother, Fairy that is, brilliantly and hilariously played by Jennifer Saunders, who it turns out had a rather dark stake in ending Fiona's curse.",Shrek 2
260,eagle_owl,Fails to recapture the magic of the original.,5,22 February 2005,"Shrek was a brilliantly inspired send-up of traditional fairy tales, giving me high hopes for this sequel, but sadly it proves to be a backward step, failing to recapture the magic of the original.The CGI remains uniformly astounding, and the increase in computing power means that it's even more eye-popping this time around. However all this means nothing without a decent script. The biggest disappointment is that they seem to have made everything a bit too serious, most noticeably in Shrek's rather glum demeanour throughout most of the film, and funny lines are far harder to come by.One of the biggest irritants in Shrek 2 is the lengthy musical numbers, which aren't even original, and feature the sort of toe-curling songs usually favoured by karaoke. It would have been a far better decision to make use of a dramatic score for the action highlights.Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy, is still good value. However he is the only amusing character in the entire film, and any comic momentum he generates is dissipated by the writers' obsession with their tedious plot, and the aforementioned musical interludes.The original Shrek was tremendously fresh and fun. This sequel, while not a total disaster, remains a massively missed opportunity. As Shrek 3 is currently in production, I really hope the creators will look at what didn't work this time, and be able to make amends. However, I get the sense that the first Shrek was something of a one-off, and that there aren't too many good ideas left to mine from this particular seam.",Shrek 2

Simply the best movie this year to date... forget about what the critics say... this movie will make you laugh almost every minute... it's highly enjoyable and worth every single cent i paid for it... highly recommended... believe me... i'm lost for words trying to describe how great the movie is ! Anyway, about the story...*warning* spoilers ahead! Tells about Shrek and Fiona's life after they got married...with of course...the donkey still around...and one day, they were called back to the kingdom, far far away...(now this is really far)... where they meet Fiona's parents, Mr. K and Mrs. Q ... And there's the Fairy Godmother who tried to break up Shrek and Fiona. Apparently, there's some secret behind the King which the Fairy Godmother knew about so the King had to help her. That's where the funs starts... there's the Hitman! (puss in bootsss...purrrrrr ) and Shrek's buddies from the swamp and a few spoof from films such as Mission Impossible etc...and many many more fairy tale characters.... all these adorable and cute characters make this movie worth a watch!So why wait now? Grab your popcorn and head to your nearest movie theatre now!****1/2 out of *****.(This review was brought to you by a normal movie fan with no professional training in movie reviews...)",Shrek 2

265,blw37,Disappointing,6,21 November 2004,"The original Shrek was just that - original. While I didn't rave about it the way that many others have I admired the producers for doing something different and taking a risk. Shrek 2 was, by comparison, flat and unadventurous.The basic story of the film has Shrek and Fiona returning to Far Faraway to meet Fiona's parents who are upset that their daughter has married an ogre rather than the planned Prince Charming. The King, under the influence of a scheming fairy godmother, tries various schemes to separate the two ogres and for a while seems successful, but at the last minute...There were some good allusions to other movies and ""real life Hollywood"" but these did not outweigh the predictability of the story line or the unexpected flatness of the music choices (with the exception of the fairy godmother's ""I need a hero"" in the climactic set piece).Overall a disappointing 6 out of 10",Shrek 2
266,Zaptharo,"With passion, I enjoyed it very, very much..",9,20 February 2009,"In a fairy tale land in which almost anything bizarre can happen, you have Shrek 2. Fans of Dreamworks Animation will go bananas over this film, and it's not hard to see why. In fact, I find it hard for anyone NOT to like Shrek. While Shrek set the standard of a fairy tale film filled with hilarious moments and lovable creatures, the sequel outshines anything the original had.Shrek, Donkey and Fiona embark on a journey to Far, Far Away, which is very much a portrayal of Hollywood. The reaction from the citizens on their arrival, however, have disregarded Shrek being the new son-in-law, and Fiona's parents aren't exactly kind to see Fiona with him. Meanwhile, the Fairy Godmother makes a plan to have Prince Charming marry Fiona, and to have no relations with Shrek. In a series of hilarious scenes and memorable moments, Shrek goes on a quest to not only save Fiona from Prince Charming, but also to find his true destiny.There are many references in this film, pointing mainly to English canon and the recent Hollywood films. Shrek 2 is a hilarious riot from start to finish, which explains why the film went on to make over $400 million at the box office. The talents of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz are back, along with superb performances by John Cleese and Antonio Banderas. Voice acting is top notch, and the animation is high quality. In an age where 3-D animated pictures and cartoons seem to flood today's entertainment market, Shrek 2 is a breath of fresh air. Furthermore, the soundtrack is completely original and does not borrow from music artists or other films.Overall, the sequel to Shrek was well made and done. I am probably one of those who prefer the sequel over the original, since it was more fast paced and witty. It is a classic that stands on it's own, very much like Toy Story. Everyone in my family enjoyed it, and I can't see why anyone else couldn't. Despite my criticisms for recent Hollywood fare and pop culture, Shrek 2 sticks out. So go ahead and do yourself a favor to watch this movie at least ONCE. A hilarious film that will entertain both fans of comedy and fans of fairy tale novels.Nine out of Ten.",Shrek 2
267,mike-547,why?,1,25 October 2004,"Hated the first shrek (mean spirited, stupid, lousy animation) The second is a perfect example of why sequels should not be made. There is nothing worth seeing or hearing in this film. Ten years from now people will only vaguely remember the first and will probably be surprised that there even was a sequel. The animation is stiff and unappealing, nothing at all when compared to the average Pixar film where you see every hair on Sully's body move with a totally realistic look, or you see the very molecules of water move as Marvin and Nemo swim through it. Mike Myer's Scottish accent (????) has got to be one of the worst ever. I've heard 6th generation southerners who have a stronger natural Scottish accent then this embarrassment that he keeps subjecting us to. All in all this film rates a -3 out of 100",Shrek 2
268,chuckc,"Yawn and Chortle, Chortle and Yawn",6,30 May 2004,"Shrek 2 follows the old Joe Bob Briggs maxim of movies sequels: just make the same darn movie again. Yes, all the issues, plot points, and gags of the original Shrek are here--acceptance of people (or, in this case, ogres) even though they're different from you; good-looking people looking down on what they perceive to be ugly; Shrek having to rescue Fiona from a marriage-related event and becoming more ""human""; Shrek constantly telling Donkey to to shut up; flatulence jokes; and, of course, Disney bashing (such as easy target these days). This makes for a pretty slow-moving story, at least compared to the original. There are some amusing moments (mostly from Antonio Banderas's Puss-in-Boots), but as a whole, the movie seems a bit tired; your average episode of The Simpsons has more laughs.Dreamworks Animation has to move beyond Disney-and-fairy-tale bashing. They hit the bullseye so often in the first Shrek, that there's little left to hit (especially now that Disney is getting into the act, too).",Shrek 2
269,kellyleighcrutcher,Does anyone else think Puss in Boots was their favorite character?,10,5 October 2006,"If I could rate this any higher than a ten, I would. This is one of my favorite movies.Does anyone else think Puss in Boots was their favorite character? He was mine. I loved the cute little 'innocent kitty' face with the big eyes he made several times to catch enemies off guard during the movie. It did the trick! I also liked the way they based Puss off 'Zorro' with the black cape, the rapier and the black hat and had him carving a 'P' into trees instead of a Z. I especially loved the lines when he was telling Shrek and Donkey: ""Please, no, por favor, por favor, please no, I implore you. I was doing it for my family! My mother she's sick and my father he lives off the garbage. The king offered me much money and I have a little brother..."" and the later line where Donkey says, ""Do I look any different?"" Puss' reply is priceless: ""You still look like an ass to me!"" Antonio Banderas played the role perfectly. I really hope they keep Banderas on as Puss in the following ""Shrek"" sequel (s? I don't know if there'll be more than three.); now that they introduced Puss, the movies won't be the same without him.",Shrek 2
270,BigRichAU,Funny but charmless,6,15 November 2004,"One of the successful things about the original Shrek was its combination of a children's story with gags that adults would enjoy. This sequel focuses on the gags and forgets almost entirely about story. A key sign of this is the number of situations or events that have no real purpose in the story outside of their, alightly adult, gag-value. The introduction of modern life into the story is also an extremely lame ploy to get cheap laughs, and lucrative commercial tie-ins. It's a fun film, with great performances from Jennifer Saunders and Antonio Banderas, but it's irritatingly 'knowing' and smacks of the media in-joke cynicism that the first film so successfully, and subtly, satirised. I felt a bit uncomfortable watching it with the kids.",Shrek 2

It was a breath of fresh air and that rarest of all animals: a kids movie with genuine laughs for grown ups. Shrek II has plenty of great gags and visual jokes--but that is all they are. Just gags. The freshness is gone, and the story carries little weight. In the first movie, the jokes were funny AND they revealed character and moved the plot. Here they are one unconnected laugh after another.You will enjoy Shrek II. It is funny. You will probably laugh more often than your kids.

Yet again the movie references a few hundred other movies and mocks everyone on left and right.However, I couldn't help but to feel that I saw this movie already. Shrek 2 simply followed the successful formula of Shrek. So it is still funny, even very funny, but it is lacks the originality of the first movie.Overall: 8/10",Shrek 2

Do they really live happily ever after or are the real problems just starting after the marriage? Well, Shrek 2 starts with the happy ending after Shrek 1 (with a short recap and the beginning of their honeymoon) and goes on with Shrek and Fiona visiting Fiona's parents to get their blessings and attend a ball.From start to end the movie has absolutely *great* music, tons of references to other movies (Alien, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Ariel, Ghostbusters, what- ever (see the references in IMDb)) and a new twist on zig fairy tales. It's one of the few sequels that is as good or better than the original (like Alien 2, Back to the Future 2 and a few others), that every person from ages min to max can enjoy and it actually conveys a very good message. In the classic fairy tale the beautiful princess gets the charming prince, which is nice, unless you aren't beautiful or charming. So in this movie, the princess actually choses her love instead of the charming prince and they chose to stay orges instead of beautiful humans which is a nice twist. Hmmm ... and I don't want to sound strange, but Orge-Fiona actually looked nicer than the human one - must be the way she smiled and that she seems fun to be with.So, I hope there is a Shrek 3 ... and hopefully again with Puss-in-Boots (he was sooooo cute :-) sniff).",Shrek 2
274,stratsz28,"A less entertaining, more adult-oriented version of the original",5,12 June 2004,"**ONE JOKE SPOILER**As a disclaimer, I would like to point out that I found the original ""Shrek"" movie to be very entertaining (I'd give it an 8/10).However, this movie, ""Shrek 2"", really pales in comparison, and it is certainly not deserving of the record-breaking sales it did at the box office. Despite what you've heard, this movie IS NOT as funny as the first.  The humor is sitcom-esque, overall pretty predictable.  While the references to pop culture and classic movies are fun, they're not laugh out loud funny. How many times do we have to see a parody of Dustin Hoffman pounding on the chapel glass in ""The Graduate"" before it gets old?  (I seem to remember Mike Myers already using this gag in Wayne's World 2)Additionally, the characters are not as dynamic as in the original movie.  I know that sounds silly for a cartoon, but the first movie demonstrated better writing and character development.The plot was inferior, and the movie dragged at times.  Again, predictability seemed to be the greatest vice of the movie.Finally, the movie was more intentionally adult-oriented, which actually diminished its charm and its quality.If you're bored, you may find this flick worthy of watching in the theatres.

I hope you don't mind me saying so, but it's just a great movie. Great songs. Great animations. Great movie. Great for kids. Great for adults.It's like a movie that says ""You can never be happy with others--if you're not happy with yourself."" Shrek 2 is good for everyone in that way: it teaches the audience about love, self-respect, and how to laugh.I don't see any reason why you shouldn't watch this movie (whoever you are).

I especially enjoyed Jennifer Saunders voicing of the godmother and John Cleese as the King. I probably would enjoy them reading the newspaper though. For those unfamiliar with Saunders, try finding Absolutely Fabulous on cable TV. If you are unfamiliar with Cleese, you must have been living in a cave.

277,Myssi from McF,Two ogre thumbs up!,8,13 July 2004,"I really am a fan of the first Shrek. It wasn't a highest technical achievement in animation but it was written unbelievable well. All the characters were excellent and the movie had just the right gross humor on it. Of course I was excitingly waiting the sequel. Who wouldn't?Trailer for the Shrek 2 was given to audience pretty long time ago. When I saw it I thought that they have ruined the idea. Trailer showed only couple of boring jokes, basic characters and that's all? I was wondering that why did they had to make a sequel only to collect extra money with name Shrek? After seeing the movie I have to admit that I had thrown the towel too early.In the very beginning, movie grabs you in with fast paced jokes and fluent introduction of Shrek's & Fiona's honeymoon. It didn't go long to me to realize that the trailer was not a usual spoiler but instead it was just telling that Shrek 2 is coming and showing only the obvious. All the magnificent jokes and funny plot twist were left to the movie giving excellent surprise to the audience. Once again the storytelling is fantastic feeding the viewer with clips of the all hit movies from couple of years and mixing many fairy tale characters in it very well. It shows that makers really have put effort to make the film as fluent as possible tweaking every singly detail and picture to their finest. All Characters are extremely well written and the voice talents are giving their best; special credits to remarkable Eddie Murphy as a Donkey (Noble steed). Also the great variation of music is played during the movie and it fits in the mood very well.
Shrek 2 really salutes the first movie and turns out to be one of the year's best movies and extremely good sequel. And for those who are knocking theater door to get out before the end credits have even started: I suggests you to check the credits, you will be rewarded greatly.",Shrek 2

It's so hard to write reviews of the good movies. It is much easier to trash the bad ones.""She has her work cut out for her. Shrek 2 is smart, extremely funny and comes across with just as strong a message as the first movie. Shrek and Princess Fiona are invited to her parent's castle in the kingdom of Far Far Away so that they can meet her new husband. The entire kingdom is astonished and upset to find that their little princess has grown up to be a happily married ogre. Shrek and her father face off, and Fiona is hurt by how little Shrek is willing to change to make her happy. It takes off from there.
The spoofs in the movie are marvelous, the old characters return in great form, and the new ones are just as entertaining. Especially good is Puss in Boots, who gets some of the best lines in this movie.Shrek 2 follows in the footsteps of its predecessor as an animated movie that offers as much - if not more - for the adults in the audience.

280,rserrano,Transcending the Genre,8,4 December 2004,"In many ways, Shrek 2 is to fairy tales, what Kill Bill:Vol.2 is to the Kung Fu genre. Although these are very different movies, both spoof all previous movies of their type and are loaded with insider allusions (just look at the length of the IMDb trivia sections for each!). Both use latest technology to create a hyper-real quality which goes beyond their forerunners to create a feel that the viewer is seeing something that has not been seen before. But each also stays true to their genres' formula conventions of character and plot that, though seemingly worn out, we still love. As a result these movies are satisfying, meeting some deep rooted needs but in novel and refreshing ways.2004 may signal a trend in this kind of treatment of well treaded genres, with Westerns and Film Noir as two other potential future candidates.",Shrek 2

I only noticed several mistakes such as when Shrek and Fiona are about to kiss at the ending, when the clock strikes twelve, and Shrek didn't turn into his original self, like the potion said he would.Overall, I only gave it a 9 because of the mistakes I mentioned and I'm looking forward to Shrek 3!",Shrek 2
282,Citizen_Cam,Much better than I was expecting.,7,28 March 2005,"I didn't have high hopes for Shrek 2. After all, it wasn't as if the first one needed a sequel. The whole point of 'happily ever after' is there's no more story to tell. Don't get me wrong; I liked the first Shrek a lot, especially the Fractured Fairy Tales element to it. And the second one develops itself mostly along that line, with surprisingly entertaining results. The story takes place pretty much after the closing credits of the first Shrek. Shrek (Mike Myers) the ogre and his bride Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are on their honeymoon. Upon returning, they are summoned to the court of the Kingdom of Far Far Away to meet Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews). But an evil fairy godmother (Jennifer Saunders) isn';t too pleased about the marriage. Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Prince Charming and a few others come into it somewhere as well. Shrek 2's main joke is the Hollywood and fairy tale pastiche. Far Far Away is Hollywood, for instance, right down to the big sign written across the mountain. The fairy godmother has a potion factory complete with union inspectors, and rides around in a limousine-shaped flying coach. There are a number of movie references as well, far too many to spot in one sitting. Shrek 2 works solely on the silliness and the send-up of all things Grimm. The characters sort of wander through the plot, especially Donkey, but that doesn't matter because all of them are instantly likable. By far the best is the Latin assassin Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas, who quibbles and bickers with Donkey over who gets to be the faithful sidekick. The Fairy Godmother is also fun, especially her crime-boss like attitude in her dealings with the king. It is hard to divine performances through voices only, but the cast seem to be enjoying themselves and are talented enough to carry off the characterisations. This is helped somewhat by everyone pretty much playing what they're used to; John Cleese's king is little more than a regal Basil Fawlty, Puss in Boots is the same role Antonio Banderas has been playing for years, and Saunders' Fairy Godmother is basically Edina Monsoon's evil twin. Shrek 2 didn't need to be made, but for an unnecessary sequel it holds up well. It's funny, it's cute, it's certainly visually impressive, with the animation standard even better than before. It's not as good as the first one but few sequels are. It stands up well as a film on its own, however; a viewing of the original is not required to enjoy the movie. In the end, Shrek 2 entertained me and made me laugh, which is really all I ask for. Good-o-meter rating: 7.5/10",Shrek 2
283,Jeff M.-3,Throw up the spoofs and hope they stick,7,24 May 2004,"""Shrek 2"" often tries to follow the pattern of movie spoofs designed as spoofs, and this doesn't necessarily mean following its own predecessor. There aren't many scenes without a foreground or background reference to either movies or pop culture. Be assured that even if you're trying to look while following the movie, you won't get them all.At times I think the DreamWorks crew looked at a scene and thought ""What can we add in here to spoof and/or skewer something else?"" Thus a couple of blatant references to Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" (two of the elves get changed into a clock and a candelabra, a shot even more pointed than the dancing furniture) and somewhat gentler pokes at everything else from Garfield to ""Lord of the Rings"" to Love Potion Number Nine.This spoof-shoehorning can be overwhelming at times, and sometimes it seemed the movie would have flowed better if we could just sit back and watch the main characters do what the plot wants them to do. The songs are more forced in this one too as DreamWorks tried to walk the line between the old Disney formula and Shrek's spoof-o-matic. (Disney itself has not followed the formula for about a decade, ever since the villain stopped getting his own song, but I digress.) The one song that did work was ""Hero"" near the end, which I enjoyed despite the slightly formulaic nature of the sequence (hero defeats obstacles, meets villain, final confrontation).As for the other aspects of the movie, there are reasons this film got a PG in relation to the target audience of children. Edgier, however, does not necessarily mean ""hipper"" or ""more entertaining"".I give ""Shrek 2"" a 7.5, in part against the overwhelming advertising but more because a 9 would have come without the overwhelming satire attempts. I did enjoy Puss, who stole the few scenes he was in. I wish Julie Andrews' character had more, but then we'd miss the payoff of the king's botched deal with the Fairy Godmother. Besides, how many other times can you get John Cleese and Eddie Murphy in the same movie? (That makes me wonder how such a spoof-laden medieval movie with John Cleese can get away without a single obvious reference to ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", but the table was most likely already full.)",Shrek 2
284,davorm,A great addition to the first...,9,21 May 2004,This movie was really funny and just worked great with the original. Of course nothing compares to the first but after all it is the first and original. But if you liked the first you must see the second just to see what happens and to laugh at all the great little spoofs of old tails and even some of the more recent movies. Its totally worth seeing in the theaters no matter what age everybody will find something funny and worth while. So if you haven't seen it already go... now...,Shrek 2
285,ANGEL-S,"Should be called ""Prince Charming, part 1""",8,9 December 2009,"Shrek 2 is not an animated movie in any common sense one would or could expect. It is a real movie disguised in an animated form. If you look at it that way, you can much better understand the 'subtle' layer under-laying below the surface which is rude, arrogant and shallow.Durring the film I was a bit disappointed about direction story went on, the intro was great, but afterwords turned into a modern typical Hollywood sitcom with every bunch of trash you can imagine about it. No Pixar's deep emotional screen writing here, sorry. Instead, you get a parody to it's limit about human nature that needs to be 'explored'.This movie (Part I, as I call it) is not about Shrek. The main character here, you wan't believe it, is Prince Charming (and his mother). They portray human greed, weakness about controlling their pre-programmed lives, unable to cope with reality, living in their own factory of dreams. By no coincidence, Prince Charming is at moments emotional (crying), and angry in its extreme, swinging between those two feelings. Society not accepting his behavior shows cruelty (laughing) that evokes an emotion of abandoned, loneliness, disappointment and despair. A natural response to this is a defensive mechanism imprinted in every living soul as an anger and wish for a revenge. Unfortunately, he is just 'a human' unable to cope with his loss, with his anger and turns into a cold creature seeking the revenge. Does anyone recognize yourself in here? By contrast, an 'ugly' (by today's marketing & human standards, at least) Ogr is eventually well accepted despite his origin, since he shows common human being qualities.This is the reason I think the main character is not only Shrek (and Fiona), who are slightly pushed aside in 2nd and 3rd sequel, respectively. The leak of subtlness in the story is what makes this sequel weaker than the first one (altought the chosen story is by no means weak and uninteresting); the way it was realized does.",Shrek 2
286,Anarchy7451,"A great movie, lives up to its predecessor!",10,29 June 2005,"The ogre is back, and this time, he has a wife! This movie begins where the previous movie left off. The movie is about a reunion with the parents of Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz, Charlie's Angels), the king (John Clesse, Around the World in 80 Days) and queen (Julie Andrews, The Princess Diaries)of Far, Far, Away. The mommy approves her marriage with Shrek (Mike Myers, Austin Powers) while her daddy has negative thoughts about it (I mean, how often do you see a smelly, ugly, green ogre hitch with a hot, sexy-ass babe? Not very often). The king plans with the Fairy Grandmother for her snotty son, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett, To Kill a King) and hires the ogre hit-man Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas, Spy Kids) to whack Shrek. Shrek along with his friend Donkey (Eddie Murphy, Nutty Professor) befriends the ferocious feline and goes off on an adventure filled with laughter, action, and suspense. A MUST SEE!!!",Shrek 2
287,bobby-maddox,Wonderfully funny and fun,10,6 April 2018,"Picking up where the first Shrek movie left off, Shrek and Fiona are now happily married and living in Shrek's house in the swamp. Donkey reappears, much to Shrek and Fiona's annoyance. The King and Queen of Far Far Away hear of their daughter's (Fiona) marriage and invite Shrek and Fiona to the palace to celebrate. When the King discover's that Shrek is an ogre he is immediately opposed to the marriage. Prince Charming, who is determined to marry Fiona, appears and he and the King band together to separate Shrek and Fiona and get Fiona to marry Prince Charming. The Fairy Godmother also appears, and she is not as benevolent as you think.Good fun, with some great jokes. Mixes medieval settings with modern in-jokes and parodies. Quite clever, some of the jokes - definitely not just a movie for kids. Rollicks along at a good pace. There are some silly sub-plots but these don't consume too much of the time and are glossed over through the frenetic pace.Great use of well-known characters from children's fables, eg Puss in Boots, Pinocchio, The Three Little Pigs.Superb animation, as you would expect from DreamWorks. Spot-on voice casting too. Pick of the bunch, for me, is Jennifer Saunders as the Fairy Godmother. She gets some of the best lines and her deliver is brilliant.There is a large amount of music in the movie, not to the extent that it is a musical (thankfully), but enough to make it more than just background. The songs are a bit hit-and-miss. Some (eg Eels' """"I need some sleep"""") fit in well with the movie and help the tone, while others just feel like populist fluff. On the whole, the choice of music hinders more than helps the movie.Overall, an entertaining way to spend 1 1/2 hours or so.""",Shrek 2

289,GLPman,"Myers, Murphy, and Diaz do it again in SHREK 2!",9,13 November 2004,"So, remember how long SHREK was in theaters? Remember how many times you laughed? Well, SHREK 2 brings back all the excitement and laughter! Myers stars again as Shrek, Murphy as the hilarious Donkey, and Diaz as Fiona.(SPOILERS)After their honeymoon, Fiona asks Shrek to go with her to see her parents. At first, Shrek isn't sure if it's a good idea. But, whether he likes it or not, he is soon persuaded by Fiona to go to the kingdom of Far Far Away. Donkey asks/decides that he'll come along, and soon enough the three are on their way. Once they reach the palace, Shrek and the King (Cleese) clash immediately. King soon takes matters in his own hands when he hires Puss In Boots (Banderas)to ""get rid"" of Shrek. In the meantime, Shrek and Donkey don't seem to be getting along so well. Puss fails, and becomes Shrek's new friend. Donkey gets jealous, but sticks with Shrek nonetheless.The three then steal a potion from the potion factory to make Shrek and Fiona's marriage go on forever so that they can live happily ever after. Donkey tests the potion and then Shrek drinks it. The next day, Shrek wakes up to be human, and Donkey a stallion. The potion also affects Fiona, however, and she becomes her once beautiful self.Seeing this as an excellent opportunity to get her son, Prince Charming, with Fiona, Fairy Godmother gives King a love potion. She tells King that the love potion is to be poured into a drink, then drinken by Fiona. The first man Fiona kisses at the Royal Celebration Ball, becomes her new love. King feels guilty and secretly puts the love potion into his drink, which is later on discovered.Meanwhile, Shrek, Puss, and Donkey catch up with their old buddies after being arrested. Their friends free them and take them to see the Muffin Man. The Muffin Man builds a big gingerbread man to crash through the gates of the palace during the Royal Celebration Ball, giving Shrek a chance to see Fiona again. Shrek makes it in time, but the giant gingerbread man falls apart. After Fiona kisses Prince Charming, Fairy Godmother realizes that King drank the love potion himself (because Fiona knocks out Prince Charming). Shrek and Fiona then turn back into ogres and leave Far Far Away, after forgiving King.",Shrek 2
290,gwaterloo,Fairy Godmother Please Hit my Line,9,3 July 2021,"The best Shrek movie easily. Songs all bang, puss is a great addition and the combo of fairy godmother and prince charming make the combo villain an improvement over Lord Farquaad.

292,drifteru,Typical sequel,7,30 May 2004,"I don't know why SHREK 2 is so popular.  It has none of the originality of the first SHREK -- or FINDING NEMO or THE LION KING or MONSTERS, INC., all of which it may very well surpass in box office revenue.  Shrek is no longer an ogre (ashamed to admit he lives in the swamp?!), Donkey is no longer an ass (his lovability is assumed), character motivation is dispensed with (Fiona bears no ill will toward her parents for isolating her in a tower?!), and what some here call ""satire"" is about as pointed as a hairball (Far Far Away is like Hollywood, get it?).The first SHREK immediately charmed with its unexpected joy in the grossness of an ogre's life, and it sustained a compelling emotional tenor about how such a one who repels others can ever find true happiness.  The resolution to that dilemma was surprising and gratifying. SHREK 2 lacks any emotional resonance and simply re-uses pre-sold characters to put over obvious jokes.  It's not totally dismal -- some of the jokes and new characters are intermittently amusing -- but it's hardly enchanting.  If the filmmakers want to create a sequel that is worth imitating instead of just a series of imitations, they should take a good, hard look at TOY STORY 2 before they start on SHREK 3.As an aside, I agree with the poster who deemed BROTHER BEAR the best animated film of the past year and disagree with another's assessment that DreamWorks can now go toe-to- toe with Disney/Pixar.  One franchise does not a dynasty make.",Shrek 2
293,jomipira,Wonderful solid fun,8,8 July 2004,"Ok, I have to admit that the surprise is gone. The original Shrek was irreverent and made fun of all the children stories known to man... The second one is on the same line but by now you expect it. Still it's been a long time since I've seen an entire theater laugh from the start till the end of a movie. Wonderful new characters (you have to love the pussy in boots), superb animation and a all-round well made movie for everyone to enjoy. But please, whatever you do DO NOT read any comments (like this one) before you go see the movie, it can ruin it for you... And watch the credits until the end, there are surprises... Enough said, just enjoy the film, it's guaranteed to make any blues just fade away!",Shrek 2
294,surfsister,Lots of Fun!,2,3 June 2004,"Shrek 2 was a lot of fun for me.  I purposely didn't read up on the story so it would be a surprise.  The beginning was a real hoot especially when Charming pulled off his helmet and revealed he was wearing a hair net! Then, when he pulled that off he threw his hair about in slow motion. Really top notch stuff.  I also enjoyed the Puss-In-Boots addition.  What a great job the pros did in developing that character (he definitely needs his own movie, now).  Every furry hair in place and all looking so real.  I loved his little kitty expression he did several times to get the ooh's and aah's before his vicious attacks.  Just like a cat!!**SPOILERS** The Fairy God Mother starts out sweet as honey, but turns into 'the bad guy' you love to hate.  Her potion factory is stuffed with all kinds of things to look at, so I am sure I will have to see this movie again to get a good look at everything.  Who were those little guys running the factory?  I couldn't figure that one out.  Pinocchio's thong scene could be a little iffy for young kids, though it was funny for us oldsters.When Shrek became human and Donkey became a stallion it added to the fun of the movie.  I really liked their new looks.Stay for the credits because there is an added bonus.  I always sit tight during the credits, now, in case there is something more.  The few people who stayed in the theatre were rewarded by a cute scene.I sure hope there will be a Shrek 3 in the offing.  They need to keep a good thing going.",Shrek 2
295,hollyandcat,"Amazing, must see film, packed with laughs.",10,17 July 2004,"Where do I begin? What am amazing, well made animation with an excellent choice of new characters and old favourites from the first one. I enjoyed every minute of it, especially Shrek and Fiona on honeymoon and the donkey and puss song at the end. They're quite good a singing really and what a funky combo. Prince Charming was such a smarmy git, wasn't he though? Obsessed with looking good, and making everything into some big rigmarole e.g. I've suffered across ice, snow and scorching desert to get her and then I find a gender confused wolf in her bed. One of the fun things with this film was spotting all the references to other things- brands, logos, films and famous people, especially when altered to fit the film e.g. Far Far Away in the style of the Hollywood Logo on the hills. Basically I recommend seeing this straight away. You won't regret it.",Shrek 2
296,gaston_,Excellent second part,10,21 December 2004,"""Second parts are always not good as the first one."" I don't know who exactly said this, but certainly, he/she wasn't talking about Shrek 2.The freshness of the characters (Hopefully, it's the same or better than in the 1st movie),as well as the new characters, make this movie really entertaining and hilarious until the last minute.The new talking-animal introduced ""Puss in Boots"", it's incredibly well interpreted by Antonio Banderas, who, at least from my point of view, takes some of the ""major figure"" from Donkey(Eddie Murphy), which was also really funny, though it didn't have the presence of the 1st movie.The movie, as the previous one, also includes some really well-thought gags, which give the movie that ""something"", which doesn't let you move from your seat while you're watching it.It is a mix of good animation, humor and a love story, which, amazingly, brings up another excellent production from Dreamworks Studios. I can't wait to see the 3rd part..I strongly suggest that, if you hadn't have the chance to watch this movie, take two hours to rent or buy it and I can assure that it'll not be worthless at all.",Shrek 2

298,Brodie_500,Shrek and Donkey need a better adventure,7,5 December 2004,"Much has been made about the 'gross-out' comedy that Shrek (and this sequel) relies upon for its laughs. But while this is true, in both films it is balanced by a humanism, a tenderness at times, that is embodied by Shrek himself and his relationships with Fiona and Donkey. And while there are times when the jokes seem strained, or repetitive, the emotional core of the narrative is thankfully never overplayed. It is the general tone that makes one think fondly of the Shrek franchise, and more importantly makes it easier to overlook the missteps. But, that said, the sequel stumbles more frequently than its predecessor, due mainly to a less focused narrative. With the first film being essentially a road movie, it is wise that the filmmakers decided not to repeat that formula. Yet, they haven't explored very far. After the primary conceit of having Shrek meet the in-laws, the narrative becomes even more contrived, not least in the introduction of Puss-in-Boots (they clearly created the character before figuring how he'd fit into the plot). Despite the strained narrative, the sequel does benefit from a better-controlled pace. It accelerates into fast-paced set-pieces (like the potion retrieval) and back into the longer dialogue scenes with expert ease. Donkey remains the funniest character, although Puss-in-Boots is a welcome addition. He's the only good new character, actually. The king and queen aren't much of a presence (although I enjoyed the frog scene), and the fairy godmother could have been given better lines (the diet jokes were just not funny).Overall, it's solid enough entertainment. They should lay off the pop culture references and make the soundtrack a little less prolific next time, though.",Shrek 2
299,paulo1b,I don't like Disney's cartoons,8,12 August 2004,"... yet I had a great fun watching this sequel to Shrek, which i quite liked as well. The concept of taking many good children stories and messing with them to make'em funny and in doing so, producing a totally iconoclast movie is very enjoyable. Some would complain about the fart jokes and such ... well it's rare enough in regular stories to be highly appreciated, it's also necessary to break the usual tale imagery. We adults can have a lot of fun recognizing old tales and assessing the ""damage"" done to them, and kids can find here a disturbing yet well built storyline. Except for some doubtful parts (especially the end) or characters (god do i hate this donkey) there plenty of entertainment here. The question i still ask myself is how will kids react to 'serious' stories after watching these. So far i've witnessed no 'negative' effect about that. And noone can deny the 'finish' of this numeric production. wow! Those guys sure know their job! It's gorgeous!

I like the ironical point of views shrek brings.The movie is a little less pretty than the first shrek and the graphics got somewhat sloppy on some aspects...

301,johnedit,Cultural in-gags galore,8,6 November 2004,"This sequel to ""Shrek"" is not quite as endearing as the original, which is to be expected. Stories of first love touch the heart more deeply compared to stories of people trying to make the love work. Those stories take much more inventiveness, which ""Shrek 2"" has, but not quite enough.The filmmakers try to make up for it by up loading up with scores and scores of fairy tale and pop culture references, too much to grasp in first viewing. The latter are mainly Disney versions of fairy tales. They're hilarious, but in time they become excessive. I wonder how comprehensible they will be 30 or 50 years from now. The visuals often are extraordinary. Many times they justify computer animation.I don't understand why the animators in the ""how they did it"" extra, want to be so realistic.

That's why an ugly one named ""Fiona's Father aka The Far Far Away King"" appeared - absolutely silly-behaving and not-really-fatherish person.

It was embarrassing watching so many of the jokes fall flat - but with only one of the writers from the original still on board, it should not have come as a surprise.Even the movie references were ignored by the audience because there was no humour attached to them - it seemed the filmmakers were just content to demonstrate their vast knowledge of good movies (see the trivia section), but instead showed their inability to make a corker of their own.As with many sequels, Shrek 2 benefits from our familiarity with the characters: if this had been the first movie, I think that even 5/10 would have been generous.",Shrek 2

But never has a movie been so successful in doing so as 'Shrek' and I am pleased to say that 'Shrek 2' is just as good (if not better) than the first. A great addition to the cast of characters is 'Puss in Boots' excellently voiced by Antonio Banderas who's performance is a very tongue in cheek version of his character in 'The mask of Zorro'. Other great additions cast voicing the characters include Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Rupert Everet and Jennifer Saunders. Eddie Murphy is brilliant again as Donkey (in my mind his best role to date).A great soundtrack also helps the story gain pace.

Throughout the film, i had that feeling of a bad Disney direct-to-video follow-up to a successful movie. The character animation seemed a bit stiff in places, like something you'd expect from an animation designer that has nothing to work off except maybe a mirror next to his computer screen. Wasn't it supposed to be a cartoon/comedy thing...? Then why do most characters stand/move/gesture like a lifeless second class stage act? This is an animated feature - which is about the same as saying ""anything IS possible"".Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of fascinating scenes and hilarious ideas, but after the movie was over, it felt completely hollow/pointless/empty/wasted time... i guess all of those obvious pokes at other movies somehow drowned its own story. Shrek 1 i saw at the cinema, AND i had to get the DVD once it was out. I did not get to seeing Shrek 2 on the big screen, but after watching the DVD, i'm sorry to say that i am glad i DID miss it. Remember, MORE of the same thing is not necessarily good...4 out of 10 after first viewing. Maybe it'll grow on me over time - then again, the same will one day be true for mold... ;)",Shrek 2

I can't believe people are giving this movie a 10.  It just didn't come together.  It had potential, but in the end me and my kids were bored. What a major disappointment.

316,mynameoleg,Shrek The Fabulous become Shrek The Feeble,5,14 June 2004,"As the princess after Shrek's kiss converted into an sympathetic ogre, ""Shrek-2"", after public's and critic's kisses converted into the bore. ""Shrek 2"" is a dumb and mindless romantic musical with slight elements of comedy. What we loved in the first movie? It was unpredictable, fresh, totally opposed to Disney-like routine. ""Shrek 2"" is absolutely predictable, it's dated, it successfully copying Disney-like routine. This sequel is like the couple of worst romantic scenes taken from ""Shrek 1"" extended into the fulltime movie. Most jokes aren't work, some of them are the examples of ordinary closet humor. The movie itself is not total disaster. However it's completely confusing, that people accepted this patchy work with recording box-office profits. Even less-than-genius 'Finding Nemo' looks like  masterpiece compared with 'Shrek' sequel. Sorry, folks, you've got your VERY BIG money not for fair work. I don't know, why creators of Shrek goin' to make a 'Shrek 3' based on King Arthur story. With their bleak comedy vision and diminishing skills it's going to be a complete failure in the world, where exists such masterpiece as 'Monty Python And The Holy Grail' yet.",Shrek 2
317,EffixC,Great without that puss,9,7 August 2004,"If the puss in boot is not list in the movie cast,I would be very happy and watch it again and again. In this new Shrek 2,I found that the movie staff used the best of their imagination and they are full of child's heart,i like the scene when Fiona's parents have dinner with their new son-in-law.It make me laughing every time and,to tell the truth,it may be the only great part of the movie. Maybe Shrek's movie staffs wanna this movie to be another ""Scary Movie"",in Shrek 2,the classical movies' most famous scene and music and more are just showed by a funny ironic way,like the prince Charming's first appearance,he waves his hair,that would be same as the appearance of Cameron Diaz in Charlie's Angels I.The rescue of Shrek,oh,listen to the music,the MI's most most and most famous one,was deducted by a cute toy. More?OK,the puss make me confused each time and ever more.why it changed its mind,to be the one who always stands with the main character?The answer might be:Antonio Banderas can bring more movie fans to the theater;Shrek need its professional ability to stole the poison;the movie make wanna us to know that it's easy and necessary to be a good man in such a movie;Just do in this way,can show the Shrek series will not be traditional Disney's TYPE.

318,pobz100,... another sequel failure,2,9 June 2004,"I think it is fair to say that we all enjoyed the first successful attempt at Shrek, just like we would have other similar films like Toy Story. It is always going to be a different challenge for film makers to identify a ""good"" sequel, and we don't see many of them.I feel saddened to report that this movie does not live up to any standards of a good movie. The dialogue is lame and the story does very little - no complaints of the animation; nothing beyond what we would expect from films today. This film moves towards an even younger audience, which is a step aside from the original Shrek. This is not the reason why I feel this is a poor movie, on it's own it just does not work.We had the delight of an original cast, story and dynamic dialogue with the first, and heck, this is not at all the case with the sequel, so therefore I would expect something else. It didn't happen at all. I laughed at one point when Shrek spat out a spoon having choked on some food.The biggest problem is the story line, mixed slightly with a musical style is just very very poor and I got bored quite quickly.Sorry, I was so disappointed myself.2/10",Shrek 2
319,toddkvamme,I don't get it either...,4,7 November 2004,"It is totally beyond me why this film is rated so high at IMDb. The movie is supposed to be family oriented and yet is filled with characters that are weak, uninspiring, uninteresting and who are more inclined to make jokes loaded with innuendo and sexual/crude references than say anything that even approaches creative movie making or script writing. The cat (Antonio Banderas) makes the show amusing, but this movie is entirely inappropriate for children. The references to other films are funny at times, but these require no creativity. The movie, when it is funny, is only funny because of what has gone before. Finding Nemo was WAY, WAY funnier, way more creative, and MUCH more appropriate for children. If this show had been marketed more toward adults..OK. But it wasn't. Don't bother showing this film to your 4-12 year old. 4 out of 10.",Shrek 2
320,KhallilR,Very entertaining again,8,12 July 2019,"With lots of humor, great characters and excellent songs, Shrek 2 is an extremely entertaining movie. The story is fast paced enough that one not only doesn't get bored, but doesn't even realize the passing time.And while the first Shrek movie was mostly about Shrek and Fiona, in this one it's the supporting characters that steal the show. Especially Donkey and Puss were a joy to watch, each of their reactions and interactions being a treat.Similarly to the first movie, Shrek 2 doesn't have the depth and emotion to be a 10/10. I wish we could've seen more of Fairy godmother's story and Shrek and Fiona's relationship. I also like Shrek 1 a little bit mostly because I preferred Lord Farquaad to the prince charming and the fairy godmother.Considering the good ending and the bad reputation of the other sequels, I think I'm going to to stop here with the Shrek saga, for fear of being disappointed with the other sequels..",Shrek 2
321,TheMagpie,"Everyone says it's good, I just don't get that!!",1,6 November 2004,"After hearing all the hype that this was as good, if not better that the original, I thought it might be a good watch.Instead of this, I saw a movie that had been stripped of the spontenaneous funny moments of the first, and replaced with mushy boring moments. It lacked that special part that was the trademark of the first movie. The voices even sound dis-interested in the movie. It was nowhere near as good as the first.When you get a movie that comes in with the hype, and you feel like turning it off half way through, then you know you have a lemon.Rating: 3/10",Shrek 2
322,DuaceMaxell,really very good,9,21 May 2004,I was expecting DreamWorks to produce something worthwhile and they did. The jokes were effectively funny and in some scenes the audience couldn't stop laughing. All of the new characters make a seamlessly good addition to the cast. Jennifer Saunders and Antonio Banderas gave the movie a richer texture and overall provided an abundance of laughs. This is a rare case where the sequel is just as good (if not an improvement) as the first movie. The people who enjoyed Shrek the first time will enjoy the second addition more; they pulled it off very nicely. I would recommend this movie in theaters and on DVD as the comedy in this movie will last beyond the box office.,Shrek 2
323,karvan_g,Very funny,9,20 May 2004,"Very funny movie. I saw it on the day of release. The theater was full and the audience loved it so much that there was an ovation at the end of the show. I loved the movie myself. I think there were very few minutes in the movie which was not funny. I would highly recommend this movie for one viewing at least. The message behind this story (both 1 &2) is  - ""Be proud of who you are and how you look. External beauty isnot everything and it is only what is inside that counts."" There is an additional character in this movie - namely, Puss in boots (spanish version). Voiced by Antonio Banderas, it is a take-off on ""Zorro"". The acting rendered by the character is especially worth watching. This movie is ""The King of spoofs"". I could identify atleast 25 movies that were spoofed in this movie. The fairy godmother is hilarious too since she tries to imitate a vamp. All in all, the movie has the original cast like Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz, who jell so much with each other in the form of the characters. Some of the other big names in the movie are Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Rupert Everett, and Larry King.",Shrek 2
324,rctrail,This is how you make a perfect sequel,8,9 April 2021,"I'm not joking when I say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen in a while. No, it's not the funniest, or the best looking, but it does almost nothing wrong. The story is pretty simple (it is a kid's movie) but there's more than enough to keep your eyes on the screen the whole time. Plus, the humor (with the exception of a few fart jokes and donkey being annoying), references, and music are all amazing and can be enjoyed by anyone of any age. There are so many movies that sour with time, but this is one that I like more now than I did when I was nine. 8.5.",Shrek 2
325,raphal,Blockbuster literacy cannot replace a plot,3,7 August 2004,"I am baffled. How can viewers say this is better than the original?! Its plot is thin, twists slow and few, characters hollow and underused... And most of the funnier moments come from the indispensable visual quoting of blockbusters (Alien, Lord of the Rings, etc., prompting a pathetic ""did you spot them all"" quest), in a poor display of cinema under-literacy. The only positive point is the technical improvement, but who cares about this? Shrek managed to be much, much funnier despite its matchstick people. The welcome infusion of new characters is a wasted effort, as none of them offer more than an inconsistent set of one-liners: the fairy godmother and Puss in boots are particularly disappointing, with only a couple of interesting scenes each, lost in a sea of contradicting and threadbare interaction. Key scenes are embarrassingly low on laughs (come on!, 5 minutes into the movie, the ""are we there yet?/no"" sequence felt like half an hour! I stopped laughing at such jokes when I was 3!). All in all, I'm very sorry to say that the few amusing moments are not worth the hour-and-a-half session. The original featured complex fun that made it very enjoyable for kids and grown-ups alike; I doubt children will even like this one (too slow, not exciting enough), and adults will hate it. I did. 3/10",Shrek 2
326,stnecniv,doesn't beat the first,7,28 June 2004,"It's hard to say why Shrek 2 is less appealing than its precedor. The storyline has more depth, but the movie shows some 'dead' moments during which you're not sure whether you have to laugh or not.The animation of characters has improved where possible. When I saw the Fairy character the first time I thought she was really human. And when you thought the castle of Sir Farquad was impressive, you should see the castle of Far Far Away. Too much is not enough!Donkey (the chatterbox) still is the funniest character in my opinion. I really laughed my *ss off when he was trying to entertain himself on the (obviously) long trip to Far Far Away.So the movie has only one flaw, being that it isn't better as a whole than the first movie. I guess that's the curse on sequels.Rating 7/10",Shrek 2
327,dfunky,Might even be better than the first one,9,23 August 2004,"I was looking forward to this film from the moment that the credits rolled up on Shrek 1.Shrek 2 follows from the first one with Shrek and Fiona living in the swamp happily married. Then its meet the parents time.Thats all I'm gonna say about the story. This film is like the first film. Its still funny, donkey is still annoying, Shrek is still fat and ugly as is Fiona. This film however i found to be at a slightly faster pace and continuously moves from funny scene to funny scene.We also get to see the other characters a lot more including ""gingerbread man"" ""three blind mice"" ""Pinnochio"" e.t.c We also welcome a new character ""PUSS"" who has to be the cutest thing you've ever seenThe voice casting is pretty good in this film with ""Cleese"" making a good King. ""Jennifer Saunders"" as the fairy godmother is a great choice with that dry and abrupt tone.I'd say that this film was bigger better and funnier than the first so how you enjoy this film must depend on if you enjoyed the First.I loved it 9/10",Shrek 2

Keep in mind that I hadn't seen the first installation of this fine franchise, but many questions started eating away at my brain from the outset, like Isn't this love story a little much? Why does Shrek have a weird accent? How come Shrek's world seems very small? Why did people like these movies so much? Can we do something else? Needless to say, I popped the movie back out of my DVD player after about 10 minutes and haven't watched it since.I just didn't get it.",Shrek 2
329,Steve-283,"Superb, but much too short!",10,26 June 2004,"I loved the first movie for its pure originality. This film could never do that again. Fortunately the film-makers went in a completely different direction and went for the funniest script that I have heard in a long time.The one-liners, spoofs and cameos are all played to perfection. I saw this a week before general release in the UK and I have rarely heard an audience laugh so much. There were even spontaneous outbreaks of applause in places and I have _never_ heard a British audience do that before!The additions to the first film's excellent cast were wonderful - Jennifer Saunders was an inspired choice for the fairy godmother and John Cleese was superb as King Harold. But the biggest plaudits must go to Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots. If you are going to see one movie this year starring an orange feline, then make it this one!My only real criticism of this film was that it was much too short. After what seemed like only a few minutes the end credits were rolling. I suppose that there was a conscious decision to make this film a relentless rollercoaster, but with slightly slower pacing there could have been a little more character development (as in the first film).Overall, a tremendous tour de force and marvelous entertainment - proof, if it were needed, that Pixar now have a real rival.",Shrek 2
330,aregynski,A lot to live up to and does(to a point),8,23 May 2004,"I went into Shrek 2 knowing it was going to be more of the same. There would be lots of inside jokes about sex, fairy tales, and current events. It does entertain and bore at intervals just as most movies do, but doesn't have the character development that a new story has. Don't get me wrong, it's a very funny movie but I found myself looking more at the animation than ever before. The realism that the animators gave to the King and the Fairy Godmother were remarkable. Couldn't imagine seeing another animated movie that wasn't as easy on the eyes as this.All in all, a great movie as far as sequels go. Wanted to see more of the Donkey,Shrek and Puss N Boots as they go on their travels. Most fun part of the movie by far.",Shrek 2
331,whiskeyann,Puss in Boots....meow...hiss!!,8,20 May 2004,"Shrek 2 is wonderful. I don't think it is better than the first Shrek. But I really enjoyed the movie, except for someone's child yelling Donkey!!! everyone once in awhile during the movie. The animation was great and has improved a lot since the first movie. The movie wasn't boring, it didn't drag(slow) at all. I love, love, love, did I mentioned loved Puss in Boots.I was surprised by how many adults, with no kids, came to see the movie. I recommend this movie to take your kids to. It's not to long about an hour and half long. It will keep the kids laughing and interested. You might have to endure your child quoting Puss in Boots every few minutes. But it's worth it.",Shrek 2
332,sgrizzle,"Unlike it's predecessor, this movie was made ONLY for parents.",6,6 June 2004,"The first movie was made popular by the fact it was funny and entertaining with a simple story for kids, good dialogue, G-Rated humor and a few hidden jokes for adults. The second movie features a more complex storyline that jumps back and forth a lot, and much very obvious adult humor. Coming away from the movie I am surprised it didn't rate a PG-13 instead of PG. The dialogue was not as good as before. A lot less of the good back-and-forth conversations. Puss-N-Boots is an amazing addition to the movie and is definitely the best part of it. My only warning is that if you take your kids, be prepared to explain things like cross-dressing, thongs, and alternate meanings for the word ""Ass.""",Shrek 2
333,uppyjc,Excellent,10,27 December 2004,"I was waiting ages to see this film. I missed it in the cinema and I was almost kicking myself to do so. So it was great when my sister received Shrek 2 for Christmas this year. I immediately watched it and then re-watched it. Then re-watched it again. The obvious fairytale story line is great and original, being a mix of lots of other stories and lots of new bits with a typical Shrek twist. All the time there are little bits that are great. Little touches all throughout the film add a little extra charm and fun which are both already in abundance. The characters are all lovable, even Puss-in-Boots and I normally hate cats but he's just so sweet! All the fun builds up to a sad and serious middle part and stays that way up until the end of the film where suddenly, everything is all OK again (the wonder of fairy tales). The music fits the storyline perfectly and adds a little extra to an already great film. Shrek 2 is sure to keep adults and children amused and entertained with its pure excellence.",Shrek 2
334,cwhoward-1,"A very, very funny movie.",9,22 May 2004,"This movie was a riot. My wife and I went to see this movie to preview it before we take our daughter. There was a very good lesson about tolerance that this movie teaches, and it was extremely funny to boot. The relationship between Sherk, Fiona, and Donkey in this movie is certainly tightly bound and that allows the antics to insue. Any parent of a child will get what I mean in the First five minutes of the movie. Enjoy and remember to Breathe!!! It keeps your side from hurting. The reference to Cops and other TV shows as well as the Landscape for Far, Far, Away just adds to the antics. This movie is great fun and will be enjoyed by all.

335,evanz2,"Shrek 2: It's Shrek 1 again, but this time worse.",6,1 July 2015,"Watched this again as part of our (my sister and I) Dreamworks Movie Marathon. Whenever a sequel is created, there is a small chance that the new film will surpass the original in many ways. The Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part II, and Toy Story 2 are perfect examples of this uncommon occurrence. This is not one of those cases.Shrek 2 opens promisingly, then delves into a form of basic-ness unparalleled. It's amazing how much the conflict of this film is exactly the same as the original movie, just flipped onto another character. That being said, there are a few good laughs in this film, and the friendship between Shrek and Donkey is probably the best aspect of the film (as it was with the last one). Puss In Boots is a great character who was well introduced. Although, the sidekick-rivalry between him and Donkey got old real fast, but thankfully it didn't last too long. There wasn't much room for a friendship to grow between those two, which would have been a great character arc for Donkey. Yet, by the end of the film they are somehow friends because the script demands it. The animation quality was stellar (unsurprising with a budget as large as this film's), but the plot got dragged through the mud of ""Let's just do this again, it worked last time."" Not as bad a film as I remember, but the fact that the last twenty minutes were beat- for- beat the exact same ending as in Shrek knocked it down a peg.",Shrek 2

All the references to Lord of the Rings, Spiderman and the Matrix is disgusted me that the writers at Pixar and Disney couldn't come upwith their own material. Make your own movie and keep out of the other ones! I for one do not want to pay 8.50 to go see rip offs of other movies that i already paid to see the full thing. If a company really wants to make a parody then they should devote the whole movie to it, and do it right. Mel Brooks gives us an example in Space Balls. Now that's a funny movie!",Shrek 2

344,marcG106,Why was this so popular?,4,4 June 2005,"I really have a difficult time trying to figure out how a film like this could make $436 million at the domestic box office. Are American tastes so fond of immature fart jokes and already-dated pop-culture references? Apparently.This film continues Dreamworks Animation's tradition of quantity over quality, the position their CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has held from day 1. But it's gotten worse in recent years with their CG attempts, lame-duck ripoffs of Pixar or Disney classics.As for Shrek 2, I get the idea that the staff behind this picture actually believe that they're paying tribute to the fairy tales of yesteryear, when all they're doing is disrespecting them to hell and back. I don't know what people accept as ""soul"" nowadays, but this film certainly doesn't have any of it. How can I accept these characters in a tender moment when I know that one of them will probably pull a huge fart? I will give this film a point or two for the quality of some of their CG landscapes. Characters are a whole other story. You'd think that Dreamworks would remember after the first Shrek that they can't do digital humans, but nope. I've seen better animation and models in a video game. And the voices never really seem to mesh with the characters as in a Pixar film. It just doesn't work.But people will buy the soundtrack anyways, and see the film ten times to catch all the inane pop-culture references, as if that's reason enough for this to be the third-highest grossing film of all time.

Gripes aside, the threesome push off; once there, the kingdom being a very different locale to that of what a sheltered existence in a tower for most of one's life or the living in a swamp off of the land is like. Arriving to a track entitled ""Funky Town"", instilling a sense of niche, corporate credibility about proceedings, the trio uncover a place steeped in materialism; capitalism; supply; demand and a place which actually contains streets, roads, laws and an order - Shrek and the crew have their work cut out. The fact these fish are out of their proverbial waters are the least of their worries, Shrek's clashing with the John Cleese voiced King Harold, Fiona's father, the result of initial coming-togethers going awry; the expansive first dinner they all have together seeing Shrek positioned in front of a stuffed hawk mounted on the wall up and behind him as the proverbial vultures circle. Harold and Shrek's clashing carries with it an amusing undercurrent of class distinction, the fact Harold et al. are humans and Shrek is an ogre (running on how we all know human's react to such) are surface binary oppositions to that of Shrek's humble, essentially farm based background, up against that of the king and queen's rich, expansive and affluent lifestyle in this consumerist driven Dystopia.Things are complicated further when a hideous creation in the form of The Fairy Godmother (Saunders) arrives, a sort of grotesque extension of this world's ideologies; a celebrity in these parts whom whips crowds into frenzies and plays up to a kindred, spirited surface persona but is internally morally decrepit. Here is a creature whose idea of happiness is in the form of a tonic designed to gloss over all of life's problems, before quick-marching to a designated point in one's existence which encompasses artificially photogenic partners; lots of clothes and labels on top of rich, faux-rewarding surroundings - much rather than a conclusion someone may have reached naturally with somebody else for what it is they are.",Shrek 2

Improves upon the original, which is a rarity among sequels.This time around I felt it was aimed more at an adult audience. The talented cast from the first installment returns, minus John Lithgow's Lord Farquaad (for obvious reasons if you saw Shrek)...and are bolstered by wonderful additions. Rupert Everett, Jennifer Saunders and Julie Andrews are very good, but the characters played by John Cleese (The King) and particularly Antonio Banderas (Puss 'N Boots) are show-stealers. (***MINOR SPOILERS***) The transition of Puss from assassin to co-hero was well scripted, and the comedic triad between Shrek, Donkey, and Puss made for some funny moments.The movie has a number of positive messages, ranging from being yourself (Shrek/Fiona/Donkey), the power of redemption (Puss/King), and the trappings of vanity and powerlust (Fairy Godmother/Prince Charming). Package this with some very clever references, and cute sight gags and you have a fun movie to watch.The King's ""secret"" was actually pretty clever and on second viewing there are a few hints, strewn like breadcrumbs throughout the early part of the movie that give the secret away.As far as the quality of animation, you find yourself very quickly buying into the reality of the characters. Their movements are realistic, and there are nuances in each character that remind you of the voice actor playing the role.Overall, not only would i see this in a theatre (my first viewing was during a commercial flight), i'd catch it on pay-per-view (as i did on second viewing) and definitely buy the DVD.One comment regarding some of the references...i thought the decapitated knight in the Poison Apple and the King's reference to a 'crusade' wound could also be taking as a reference to Monty Python & the Holy Grail. (ie. The Black Knight...it's just a flesh wound...)",Shrek 2
350,grengrad,Another disappointing sequal to a great movie,5,23 May 2004,"I loved the first movie. It was funny and fun for me a 22 year old man to watch. This movie was slow and unfunny. Sure, there were moments of laughter, but it was nothing like the original. I think it tries to be too much. The begining of the movie was vomit inducing. The end was above average.For those who did not like the original: Run for your lives. For those who loved the original like me: I would suggest you wait to rent it and save some money on this average flick.Overall Shrek 1: 8.5/10 Shrek 2: 5.5/10",Shrek 2
351,vardak,"fun throughout, truly side-splitting in places",8,1 December 2004,"The scene of them dining with her parents was worth the price of admission alone. I haven't laughed that hard in ages. And it was more consistently funny than the first. Definitely fun for adults. Original. Creative. The animation lived up to expectations. No boring parts that you have to wait out like the first one. Definitely a candidate for movie of the year, although I'm not holding my breath for Oscar, since we all know that Oscar has allergic reactions to comedy, and, most especially, animation. [Grumble, grumble. I'm still bitter about Beauty and the Beast, which WAS the best movie that year. Nothing - animated or not - even came close. Of course, this isn't quite a Beauty and the Beast quality movie, but it's damn good.]",Shrek 2
352,Jeffnusa,Some Sequels should not be made,1,23 May 2004,"Let's see, I spent $64 at the theatre for my family of 7 to see this movie with snack bar treats.  Mike Myers lost his mojo.  No comedic talent in the movie.  Same with Eddie Murphy.  Are they now washed up hasbeens?  Cameron Diaz had a limited role.  The only saving grace for this movie is the last 20 minutes.  I recommend going to the theatre to see another movie and when it's finished duck into Shrek 2 towards the end.  It's the only part worth seeing and it's free.  I won't be buying Shrek 2 on DVD and I expect this movie to sink like a Brick after the first Weekend.  Shame on Hollywood for producing a movie for families just for the sake of having an offering for families.  More adult feel than kid feel.  Graphics and sound seem off compared with First film.  Puss and boots is awesome.  Would love to see a new spin off on this character.  All and All avoid this movie, sleeping is more productive.",Shrek 2
353,planetweirdo,Shrek 2 is a sequel and boy does it show.,6,21 July 2004,"I wasn't a huge fan of the original Shrek but I admit that I enjoyed it a lot, sadly the sequel leaves a lot to be desired. The jokes (which I might add had the audience in stitches) failed to move me, everything about the film felt forced and overdone, which may of been the intention of the film makers but the first one did it in a far superior way.But on the plus side Antonio Banderas is brilliant and Jennifer Saunders is fantastic (her Holding out for a hero number is fantastic, who knew she had such a great voice?)All in all a pretty tired effort.**1/2/*****",Shrek 2

I feel like the first one had a much better storyline. However, I will buy this when it comes to DVD as another addition to mycollection.  Since I saw this about two months ago, I can't write a very long review.Recommended: Yes6/10",Shrek 2
355,TheDeaDGuY,Just another poorly thought out sequel,4,24 May 2004,"I put off seeing the first one because I assumed it would suck heavily, I am traditionally a horror and comedy fan and I didn't see anything that would make me want to see it. When I finally did see it, I was disappointed that I hadn't gone to the theater.But this one just reinforced my thoughts that I'll probably never be going to the theater again. This movie was bad, on several levels. The sign bits have been made old by T.V., the story of this one is done at least twice every single year since movies have been invented, and most of the jokes just are not funny at all.Is this to say that there's no humor to be found? No, no way. There's humor, but it's way to thinly spread over the time given to this movie, and between the few laughs is sheer boredom from things most movie fans have seen over and over and over again.4/10",Shrek 2
356,satiricalharpy,"Shallow and stale, but just as charming",5,19 May 2005,"I had heard many great things about this movie before I saw it, which is probably the reason I didn't like it as much as I feel I should have. My expectations were too high.In comparison to the first movie, well... the first one was a refreshing kick in the butt for all those kiddie movies out there. This seems to be milking that same genre of adult-and-kid-friendly movies for all it's worth. Much of the witty banter in the first one seems to have been replaced by flat one-liners for the endless-amount of irrelevant characters in the movie and flatulent jokes, and the characters that do matter seem to be simply reading their boring, dull lines. I'm also not sure I quite get the fascination with Cameron Diaz, as she seems to have enough trouble establishing true presence in her roles where she's actually physically on screen, let alone voice-overs.That isn't to say that the movie lacks all charm. Antonio Banderas and Rupert Everett in their supporting roles offer much-needed non-linear comic relief when compared to the perpetually emo Shrek. I don't understand why the scriptwriters decided to get rid of the wisecracking green ogre that people fell in love with and replace him with a great, depressed, hulking mass of Scottish accent, but I suppose that's their decision. Eddie Murphy tries his best to recapture the Donkey's likability, but his lines come off more as tired and forced. However, I did appreciate many of the pop-culture references (my personal favorites being the Farbucks coffee scene and the ""COPS"" parody), even if they pushed it a bit too far (giving Pinocchio a thong? Come on, a little dignity please).I suppose the best thing that can be said for this movie is that it truly embodies one of its characters. Appealing to look at and charming on the outside, shallow and stale on the inside. But for a sequel, it could be worse.",Shrek 2

358,rodahitman,Is this what animation has come to,1,25 October 2005,"I find the entire premise of this movie DISGUSTING. It's basically about CLASS and social differences, somehow (*somehow*, God knows how!) transplanted into an animated world. It's a very ADULT premise, and the movie makers have somehow taken advantage of the animated medium to get their story in, and it's horrible. There's supposedly hilaaaarious gags about parodying various fairy tales throughout the movie, only they're NOT, and anyway, didn't we do that very thoroughly in the first one? Also, there's suggestions of INCEST, or whatever you want to call it - why does the fairy godmother have her tits popping out through the whole movie, especially when talking to her son? Just like is SAID at the end - ""That's his MOTHER?!!"" Yeah, I wouldn't have thought it either....When I was a kid, cartoons were about cats and mice, superheroes who flew faster than bullets or swung around the city on webs or whatever - THIS is some very weird modern version of My Fair Lady, twisted and perverted beyond all belief, and, sickeningly, with awesome *visuals*, just to make the kids go and see it. If they want to show off how many computers they have, and how many photo realistic, raytraced, realistically lit frames they can render, why not just hand us the ""Dreamworks showreel""? It's disgusting to see this pitched as a kids movie, it's nothing of the sort. I feel sorry for those who are children today, if I was growing up now, I'd throw up and probably hit someone after watching this movie.Avoid.",Shrek 2

360,sameer71,I Came. I Saw. I Asked for a Refund.,9,14 January 2006,"Firstly, Shrek can't get any better than number one. Secondly, when the sequel came out I thought it was going to be a major disaster. But when I saw some clips and trailers I do admit, I was quite impressed, especially with Prince Charming at the beginning. After about two weeks when Shrek 2 came out I went on release day and (OMG) It was...horrible! I swear I went after the movie for a refund but I didn't want to embarrass myself in front of millions of people so I tried phoning them. They asked me for my name and I gave it to them but they said they couldn't find anyone by that name. Like my rotten luck! Less music, less comedy, less action and too much suspense makes this movie a classic retard.",Shrek 2
361,beacon,Not quite happily ever after,7,20 May 2004,"I walked into this movie expecting to see more of a wonderful original movie. Instead, what I got was great computer graphics, a hilarious final act, and 50 minutes of waiting for the story to find its footing. Not that it was unbearable, but the story felt too contrived.What I liked - donkey as a stallion, the supporting characters from the swamp, Far Far Away, and Prince Charming. What didn't work - Puss in Boots, the fairy godmother, the entire honeymoon scene, and the storyline about the king. The rest fell somewhere in the middle.All in all, I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to all who loved the original, but don't go into it expecting to be blown away.",Shrek 2
362,cso5,Not bad but overrated,5,6 July 2004,"Having received some really strong recommendation from friends and colleagues, I decided to watch this movie with high expectations. Well, notwithstanding its entertainment values, I found this movie to be grossly overrated. I preferred the first installment at which I really laughed out loud. Probably, the humor factor had  already been anticipated. Regardless of the positive feedbacks, the two characters I found unbearably annoying are the Donkey and the Fairy Godmother. Eddie Murphy somehow overacted in his voice-over, and the Godmother's rendition of ""I'll be Your Hero"" during the wedding reception of Princess Fiona and Prince Charming made me sick. Anyway, my rating..an average fare 5/10",Shrek 2
363,jburton-3,More of the same,8,20 June 2004,"If you liked ""Shrek"", you'll probably like ""Shrek 2"". Just like the original, it's a send-up of many classic fairy tales. It also steals scenes shamelessly from a whole host of famous films - everything from ""Flashdance"" to ""From Here to Eternity"". The script is witty and original. Returning voices Mike Myers (Shrek) and Cameron Diaz (Fiona) stay true to the characters they established in the first film, as does Eddie Murphy as the tirelessly annoying Donkey. The most brilliant new addition is the Godfather-like Fairy Godmother character who tries to set things right between Princess Fiona and her supposedly destined beau, Prince Charming. John Cleese and Julie Andrews provide their considerable voice talents for Fiona's parents. In short, this film has everything the original had except that it's not as fresh and new precisely because it's a sequel cut from the same cloth as its predecessor. I give ""Shrek 2"" an 8, and gave the original ""Shrek"" a 9.",Shrek 2

I was expecting a half-witted sequel playing on all the same jokes as the first... Boy was I wrong! This movie, just like it's predicessor, was original and *full* of wit! In fact, I would go so far as to say it was better. The first movie, was funny - no doubt. It was hilarious, but overall it lacked the emotional draw that the second had. This movie was just outstanding. Funny beyond compare - although I'm surprised this got away with only a PG rating, considering some of the more adult oriented jokes (Not that I mind!) If I had to recommend 1 movie this summer, Shrek 2 would be it. If you enjoyed the first one, you'll *love* this one! Go see it, Now! You won't regret it",Shrek 2

Don't take that as a blanket statement as, to this point, this movie and the original Shrek are the only worthwhile movies from the DW animation studio.By the way, for those of you who didn't see Dragon in this movie, I have a bit of advice: The credits count as part of the movie (and that's true about every movie).

It was sooo boring. The best parts were Puss-n-Boots and Donkey...Eddie Murphy as always! Other than that the movie was not interesting, mostly not funny, and not something that children should see...farts jokes and sexual references are not...NOT funny in a children's movie. America should be ashamed for making this the second highest grossing movie in it's first weekend...I for one miss the family-friendly cartoons that Disney has brought out in the past years...Beauty and the Beast is a classic...filth like Shrek 2 is not. I loved the first one...don't get me wrong...but this was just a ploy to make money...my advice, don't waste your money, give it to something with heart like the Harry Potter movie or better yet, just burn your money in a trash can...you'll save yourself money and a whole lot of sanity in the long run.",Shrek 2

I loved the movie with one exception. The music was awesome. The lines were every bit as witty as the first one. It was full of parodies, and lots of secret jokes that my kids didn't get. I'm sure that there were a few that I didn't get either. My only complaint is that I would love for it to have been a family movie. There are a few inappropriate comments/innuendo that they just didn't need to put in there. That's all that ruins this one for me. I don't know why people think that make an off color remark is somehow funnier. Easier, maybe, but no more funny that using talent and hard work to drum up something original. Be that what it may, I still admit that it is great. I bought it, edited out the couple unnecessary sexual spots/innuendo and, ""Viola! It's perfect."" If it weren't for this I'd have given maybe 9 stars. Definitely a must see.",Shrek 2

And am I wrong, that Puss should have been cut out of the middle part of the movie?But here is the part I found very refreshing: With all the garbage on American television concerning makeovers and specifically like the show ""Swan"", isn't it nice to see a message to the kids that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Or that we should not worry about physical flaws when peoples true beauty is shown in their soul and personality.So for all the little failings of Shrek 2 verses the first Shrek, I will endorse it whole-heartedly for its moral message.(Also, here's another beef with the story line: after Shrek belly flopped onto the little white puff dog at the end celebration...why did they show the dog again on the stage? That is so un-Shrek worthy. They should have shown the dog just plastered into the mud with people dancing on it.)",Shrek 2

I thought they were a cop-out for directing and all of the other old-world movie techniques. Shrek 1 convinced me that the format can work and Shrek 2 convinces me that the format can be superior. Shrek 1 was a child's movie that appealed to adults. Shrek 2 is an adult movie that appeals to children. My girlfriend and I, both 24, laughed through nearly the entire movie. It is a brand of comedy that should appeal to any relatively hip member of the community. I recommend this movie for a rental night where you and the significant other want to bond over near constant laughing.

Just hearing the script from the first Shrek sends me into convulsions. I can repeat a good chunk of it from memory, because it's wry, chewy, stick to your ribs humor. (""Parfait gotta be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet."") Virtually nothing about ""Shrek 2"" is worth remembering. It's predictable, it's preachy, it's decidedly lame.

While the original Shrek includes jokes that aren't always for the little ones, parts of Shrek 2 almost made me feel uncomfortable to be watching it with a bunch of children (like when you rent a movie with your parents, and there's a sex scene you didn't know about). But, it's rated PG so a few suggested jokes are allowed, I decided, and I stopped feeling uncomfortable. I was also laughing too hard to worry about the parents squirming in their seats while their children giggled at a song that included a ""sexy tush"".Shrek 2 is guaranteed to make you laugh, so by all means go and see it!

It's not ""Shrek"" with a hasty rewrite, but a true continuation of the saga...if they do a Shrek 3, I hope it's this good.

You will also find some folks who enjoyed this movie for what it was - an animated feature for all ages.Now for the good news: If you are someone who doesn't psychoanalyze, nitpick, over-focus, and search for back-masking, conspiracies, and the mark of the beast you are going to laugh and maybe shed a tear and wonder where the 93 minutes went.One extra tip: Go later in the evening when the babies are dragged into the theatre to cry during the show!Oh, also: Be prepared to see it again - you CANNOT see every little detail and nuance inserted in only one showing!Have fun!",Shrek 2

But after having to sit through it a dozen times with my kids, it grew on my until I began to truly enjoy the humor and symbolism. I would like to say that I could do the same for this installment, but alas, I cannot bring myself to do so.The voice talents of Meyers, Murphy, and Diaz are easily recognizable and do the film justice, but the storyline leaves a great deal to be desired. Such as content. We have to suffer through a protracted ""are we there yet?"" sequence that those with kids realize isn't truly all that funny. The underlying premise is a re-hash of ""Meet the In-Laws"" and winds up with the ulitmate hypocritical confession of daddy dearest who turns out to be the frog that everyone has read about in the fairy tales. Guess it turned out alright for him, til Shrek showed up. The irony of this plot is lost on the kids but makes the adults go eh? I did enjoy several of the sequences where Shrek and Puss in Boots had center stage, but they faded fast. The Fairy GodMother was rather plebeian and could have been done better.

I enjoyed the original Shrek and held a high opinion of this movie...I cannot believe the massive let down that I experienced with this. My wife and I saw this with my nieces and even they didn't think it was funny at all. The adult references (a plenty) were very tacky and not very effective at all. I'm glad I have the Unlimited Movie Pass at Blockbuster...otherwise I would have been upset at having paid three dollars for a crappy movie. I would classify this one in the ""horrible failures"" file, along with the entire Guyver series and any video game to film movie (including Resident Evil).

It's not that I just don't like kids movies -- I am actually a big fan of them....when they're good. ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"", ""Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas"", and ""Toy Story"" are all very good movies, and some of my all-time favorites. ""Shrek 2"", however, is NOT one of those movies. It's not even as good as the first Shrek movie.

394,Zerothis,The Brothers Grimm really weren't so much authors,7,30 May 2004,"In trivia, it says:The Fairy Godmother says, ""What in Grimm's name..."" - a reference to the Brothers Grimm who are the authors of many fairy tales such as the ones used in the movie.The Brothers Grimm really weren't so much authors. They tracked, traced, collected, cataloged, studied, consolidated and edited many fairy tales in to book form. The original authors of most fairy tales are lost to history. But the tales were probably invented by mothers and told to their children. Many could be described as 'allegories inspired by actual events'. In the absence of literacy, or literate women being discouraged from educating their children, or 'common' peoples (literate or not) being prevented from acquiring biblical knowledge (at one time no one was allowed to read the Bible, not even priests, without the personal permission of the Pope), mothers need ways to teach their children about morality, spirituality, and the harsh realities of life in a way that wouldn't stir up trouble. The daughters retold these tale to their children, who told their children and so on. By the time the Brothers Grimm got hold of a tale it could be 100 years old. In some cases the tales had its origins thousands of years in the past.",Shrek 2

It follows on the story of the first perfectly and in a place where the story should go.

But we also can't forget to mention the classic gang. Donkey is still hilarious and especially where he has Dronkey Babies, Fiona does not do much and yet is still the main focus of the story but still nice, and Shrek, Shrek has a nice theme in the Shrek series, In 1 he learns the value of Friends and Love, but in here he learns to be accepted by society.

Bear in mind, I think the first Shrek is an 8/10 great film, so when I say this is better, I mean it. The idea of an ogre learning to love others is a very compelling plot point to start off with in the first movie. But It isn't a perfect experience after Shrek and Fiona are married. They end up having to deal with the kingdom of Far Far Away learning to love them and appreciate them for being ogres. This plot point, in my opinion, is extremely compelling. If you then factor in all the other amazing aspects, such as the humor, characters, Writing, Villain, and overall story, you get a simply amazing film.9/10, I highly recommend it.",Shrek 2

402,edingt02,Shrek 2 Review,9,15 December 2010,"Shrek 2 picks up where the first movie left off after the marriage of Shrek and Fiona. It is a funny, light hearted animation where Mike Myers returns as the voice of Shrek, along with Cameron Diaz as Fiona, and Eddie Murphy as Donkey. The happily married couple is invited to Far Far Away, where the King and the Queen reside for proper introduction of Princess Fiona's true love, Shrek. There is immediate tension between the King and Shrek as an Ogre was not what he expected to be married to his daughter, who also secretly transforms into an ogre at nightfall. Although the King seems to disapprove, what really matters is that Shrek and Fiona love each other for who they are and will fight for that letting nothing get in the way, not even disapproval of the in-laws. However, the King and the Fairy Godmother had a deal that Prince Charming was supposed to wed Fiona, but when he made an attempt to rescue her from the dragon's dungeon to his surprise Fiona was already in love with someone else and on her honeymoon. When Prince Charming's mother, The Fairy Godmother, realizes that things did not go as planned she becomes outraged with the King who had no idea this was going to happen and they begin to plot ways to exonerate Shrek so Prince Charming can become part of the heir as originally agreed upon by the King and the Fairy Godmother. The Fairy Godmother wants him to poison Fiona with a potion so that she will fall in love with the first man she kisses, and arrange for that to be Prince Charming. This will also prevent her from transforming back into an ogre ever again. When the King does not wish to follow through with this the Fairy Godmother begins to threaten the King that he won't get his happily ever after. The typical fairy tale story does not exist in this film. Everyone does not approve of the princess being married to Shrek this massive green ogre when the story says that a princess will be rescued and fall in love with her Prince Charming. Unlike so many other stories, for example where Cinderella has a Fairy Godmother to help her and is rescued by her Prince Charming when he comes for her with the glass slipper, in Shrek 2 everything is opposite that. There are many references to and jokes made to other fairy tale like stories throughout this entire movie which is part of the humor! The color in the film is brilliant, bright and vibrant which flows really well with this animation. By the end of the movie Fiona realizes she realizes she loves Shrek just the way he is even if it's not human and that she wants to remain an ogre with him, just the way true love should be.",Shrek 2
403,saskCritic,What a Sequel Should Be,10,22 May 2004,"Memo to all Screenwriters:If you ever intend on writing a sequel to a wildly successful film, use Shrek 2 as your guide. Why?A number of reasons make this sequel worthy of standing alongside the original Shrek - not the least of which is the development of new characters which seamlessly melt in to the picture - and are not jarringly new (unlike in some films where new characters are rammed in to the film just to build a larger ensemble cast.) From Fiona's parents, to the Fairy Godmother, to Puss-n-Boots, every new character which appears in this film isn't overwhelming to the senses -- and doesn't require the viewer to think much in remembering who's who...Part of the charm of the original Shrek was its ability to take true pop culture (not to be confused with the current flavour-of-the-week on the pop scene) and turn it on its head. Shrek 2 does not fail in this area either -- and one has to believe part of the reason why the comedy in this film seems so timeless is because of the nature of the film. It's easy for Hollywood to turn around a live action film in a matter of months full of references to what's hot in pop at the moment -- animation requires more planning, and a script-in-hand much earlier (for things to be done right)... the cultural references are fun, and familiar.Ultimately, Shrek 2 continues to carry on the original's tradition of creating fun for the whole family... funny physical humour the kids will love alongside the somewhat 'PG' innuendo that kids won't notice and parents will laugh hysterically at.As fun as the original -- with a new original idea.10/10.",Shrek 2
404,rfmh2,Absolute gem of a movie,10,31 May 2004,"I adored Shrek 2, even more than I liked Shrek. Antonio Banderas' Puss In Boots is a wonderful character. Eddie Murphy also turns in another excellent comic performance as Donkey. The pop culture references are very well done, and extremely funny. The final sequence is very touching and done with real class. The animation certainly sets new heights; it may not be as pretty as Finding Nemo, but the CGI is a lot better. Some of the facial expressions are priceless, and really getting to close to simulating proper expressions. There are some wonderful lines, which are bound to enter the common lexicon of movies quotes. Particular scenes to watch out for is the parody of 'Cops' - 'Knights', the scenes with Puss' eyes (you'll see what I mean) and the 'Holding out For a Hero' sequence (especially Mongo). One of the best movies of 2004 so far, without a doubt.",Shrek 2
405,AirraptorXRC,"Not the original, but good nonetheless",9,1 June 2004,"Picking up where the original Shrek left off, Shrek and Fiona return from the honeymoon only to be off again when they receive an invitation from Fiona's parents to a wedding ball. Apparently, the King and Queen of Far, Far Away have heard about their daughter's marriage, but are unaware that she married an ogre, and they are in for a shock. Complicating matters is a Fairy Godmother with whom the King has a deal with; apparently, Fiona was supposed to marry the Godmother's son, Prince Charming, but Charming arrived too late. And what Fairy Godmother wants, Fairy Godmother GETS.While not better than the original Shrek, Shrek 2 does very well for a film the producers originally never intended to make. The actors reprise their roles well for their second outing, and the new voices and faces make ""2"" a welcome addition to the franchise. Jennifer Saunders plays ""Dama Fortuna"" with wonderful duplicity, Rupert Everett is perfect as the vainglorious Prince, and Antonio Banderas steals the show as the ""ogre slayer"" Puss-in-Boots. The music's not as good as what was featured in the original, but fits for this film. Overall, this is a wonderful stand alone film, but one should walk in with thoughts of the original somewhere else.",Shrek 2
406,dag_twiggy,Fairy Godmother song at party?,8,11 June 2004,"Hey everyone, I was wondering about the song that the Fairy Godmother sang during the wedding party, when she's on top of the piano. I was just wondering if it's a remake of an older version of song? Or is she just impersonating someone? Some older people that were sitting in front of me were singing along with it and were busting up while she was singing.Were they just amused elderly people or is there an inside joke that I'm missing?""...you're tellin' me that there's no hope, I'm tellin' you you're wrong...""",Shrek 2
407,TheLionsMane,One of the best summer films this year.,9,8 July 2004,"Every once in a while there comes a film that is better than the first installment. Shrek 2 is definitely one of them. It has all the prequel has and more. It is amusing, touching, and action-packed, and has a perfect cast. Shrek is just like he was before, a green, ugly, but good-hearted ogre who just wants the best for his wife. Donkey is the same hilarious, stubborn mule who just doesn't have a clue. Fiona is deeply in love with Shrek, but as with every husband and wife has arguments with him. And then there is the new characters, most notable of which, from my point of view, is Puss in Boots. He could well take over the role of best friend from Donkey, although I hope that never happens. He is funny and cute, but at the same time there is the menacing side to him, the side of the resourceful assassin with a deadly reputation, which makes him a likable character, but one who can't be trusted all the same. In my vote, ******** out of **********.",Shrek 2
408,Artstar,Shrek 2 misses the mark,3,4 December 2004,"Where do I start with this movie? My main complaint would probably be that this sequel has the exact same theme and message as the first film. I'm all for the ""be proud of who you are"" thing but we already saw it in the first Shrek, so why trot it out again here? The new characters introduced are not great. Puss in Boots is good, but Fiona's parents are bland and the Fairy Godmother is a thoroughly unlikeable villain (and not in a good way).Dreamworks uses a lot of tactics that make me cringe non stop. The first is their belief that every single character has to be voiced by the biggest A-List star around. This doesn't always produce the best results. Sure, they got Julie Andrews for the Queen, but why bother? The character is so paper-thin as to be almost totally inconsequential. My second Dreamworks annoyance is the constant sight gags. EVERYTHING is a joke. Yes, we live in a post-modern world but this constant gagging on pop culture gets old in a microsecond. It also dates the film horribly. There are so many 90's / early 00's references that watching the film ten years from now will be like watching Saturday Night Live sketches about the Reagan administration- they're kind of funny, but not really since you don't remember half the people they're mocking. These films will not hold up well over time. Kids will see them in 2025 and wonder why their parents are laughing.I really feel that Dreamworks needs to stop trying to milk the Shrek cash cow and move on to something different. Shrek 3 (and apparently Shrek 4) is already in the works. After whoring out the Shrek cast to hawk everything from candy bars to automobiles, do they really think people won't get sick of it real soon?A final note- closing the film with ""Living la Vida Loca?"" To put in so many ""hip"" pop culture references and then finish the film with a song that nobody thinks is remotely hot anymore shows poor planning on the part of the film makers. At least they ended the first Shrek with ""I'm a Believer,"" a song that some viewers could feel nostalgic about. No one will become nostalgic about this film in the future. It will just remind them of how hollow and unoriginal our current times can be.",Shrek 2
409,Muppetman1029,One of the best animated movies ever,10,3 May 2014,"It's the best animated movie, but it's definitely one of the top three Dreamworks movies. The jokes are hysterical, especially the Hawaii Five-O, Garfield, and Annie jokes. However, the humor isn't the only good thing about this movie. The animation is great. There is also a lot of creativity. The most creative thing being the villain bar, made even more creative by the name (Poison Apple). I also think that the film has two of the best Dreamworks villains, Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother. I think the best thing about the story about the part about Shrek and Fiona turning into a human. (Donkey as a horse was funny) I think this is the best part because I think this really makes Shrek and Fiona much more developed. This is a movie I feel comfortable recommending to everybody.

It will keep you busy laughing for about an hour! It's worth seeing twice! To be honest I most liked the cat in it! He is so cute with his boots and his big eyes. This movie is about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Sure, some parts of the movie has sensitive parts, but it is really funny! The story is about Shrek and Fiona has just got married and are on their honeymoon. When they get home again, Donkey is waiting for them at their home, and not just him. The king of the land ""Far Far Away"" has sent out a messenger to tell them that he wants to celebrate Fiona and her fiancé, but when Shrek, Fiona and Donkey gets to the castle the royal family will be shocked and something more strange is going on in Far Far Away!

412,Jazz1987_,One of the best ever films!!,10,1 January 2007,"I strongly recommend Shrek 2! I think anyone who likes films in general, or just cartoons or wants a good laugh should watch it. It's one of my favorite films and definitely is my favourite cartoon one, I even know the dialogues and songs of by heart, but I keep on watching it! It's a film that anyone can see, from very small to...not so small. It's got a great sense of humor and good music, including a brilliant Tom Waits song. I think it's much better than the last, it's much funnier and the only drawback is that it looses the novelty. Probably the best and funniest part is that of Puss in Boots, who is voiced by the great Antonio Banderas, who not only is the English Puss, but does his own translation into the Spanish version. All the other voices are great too, I loved Rupert's!! Just like the first there is a great start and it keeps the standard all the way through the film. I think everyone should see this, but should first see the first one to see exactly what happened. You should also see it on a big screen if possible as it's got so much detail!

413,jonathangoetze,To Be Honest,10,13 March 2018,"You have to have a very high IQ to understand Shrek. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of swamp physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Shrek's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature,for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depth of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Shrek truly are idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance the humor in Shrek's godlike catchphrase ""What are you doing in my swamp"", which itself is a reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Andrew Adamson's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

The soundtrack is impeccable and carefully crafted with bops such as ""All Star"" by Smash Mouth set the tone for a fun loving and carefree exposition with underlying tones of sorrow.

422,ms-thickie,my thoughts,8,3 April 2007,"""Shrek 2"" is a movie that people of all ages can enjoy. There is comedy for children and adults as well as lessons we could all learn from. Throughout the film we follow a newly wed couple as they travel to meet the bride's parents. When they arrive the parents are appalled to find that the spell that was placed on their daughter is broken making her an ogre like their son-in-law. The father discriminates against his daughter's husband when he used magic to be human and marry the woman he loves. At the end of the movie he is found out but his wife loves him even after she knows he is really a frog.While the film pokes fun at almost every Disney movie made, making characters such as the fairy godmother a villain, it also makes a valid point; you don't have to be beautiful to live happily ever after.",Shrek 2
423,linuxik,the best film full of funny scenes :D,10,31 October 2007,"This is the best film, I've ever seen. Very good and funny cartoon, excellent plot, brilliant characters. Very good music and songs. Great continuation of the first part, NOT BORING! On the contrary very funny, full of scenes where you don't keep humourless face :) Film suitable for all generations - adults, pensioners but mainly for children. But people who are older will love this film ,too. But I think pensioners will go to the cinema only because of their grandchildren. All the three films are super but personally I think this is the best part of three films, because it has got the most interesting plot. If you don't see this film, go to the cinema or see it on TV, you won't regret it!!!!",Shrek 2
424,Alska,"Enjoyable, funny film.",9,29 December 2007,"After seeing the first Shrek film and loving it completely, I was worried about the sequel being bad, as sequels often are. Luckily, I wasn't let down by Dreamworks. The film is brilliant and in some places, hilarious. All the favourite characters are back with some great new ones added. My favourite new character was Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas. He really gave life to the character. He had some really funny jokes and he's just a great voice actor overall. I think Shrek 2 took all the fun of Shrek 1 and improved on it. It was a great laugh and worth the price of the cinema ticket.The one thing I think that could have improved it, is that the romance between Shrek and Fiona was a bit cliché and cheesy, but I suppose it is a fairy tale story intended for kids, so it doesn't matter too much. Also, the small dog wasn't animated very well. But those are just very minor problems I had with the film.Overall, I recommend it to families with kids and even teenagers will enjoy this great, fun filled film - I should know, I'm one of them.",Shrek 2
425,hcmueller,Great movie for adults an children - a very well-done sequel,10,3 July 2004,"My first thought, after I I've seen there would be a ""Shrek 2"", was: ""Oh no, pleeaase, don't!"" Shrek was very good in my opinion so I feared they would just produce a bunch of ... mud. After disappointing Matrix 2 and other bad sequels to (more or less) good movies, I was quite sure, Shrek 2 would become either a completely boring movie or one which is completely ""overfilled"" with bad gags.But some friends of mine persuaded me to watch the premiere and I was enthusiastic after it. Not too much songs, not too much tawdry love-scenes and a lot of good gags. My favourite character is (how could it be else) the ""Puss in boots"" - very well done. The helpless expression of it's face is so sweet and funny, I couldn't stop laughing for minutes, especially when he ""stops"" the soldiers who are hunting Shrek and Fiona.After all the movie is a nice surprise with a well-done soundtrack. Some minutes in the middle without climaxes couldn't prevent the 10 points. :)",Shrek 2
426,kenpaul,"Script should be Shredded, two.",2,12 August 2004,"What a major disappointment.The script was formulaic.The Jokes were all rehashed. They simply weren't funny.I found it boring. My wife found it boring. All three children did as well.The voices were far too bland and forgettable in many of the key roles.Shrek's character lost its edge. The emergence of Shrek's fundamental goodness in the original movie left no where to go in the sequel.This ended up being just a waste of time.Why this movie is making so much money, I'll never know.",Shrek 2
427,watty1964,Where was the dragon?,6,4 July 2004,"Just seen this film and although enjoyable in it's own rights it was not a patch on the first one. The best thing about the first movie was, in my opinion, the dragon. The worst thing about the follow up was that she did not make an appearance until after the final credits! I audibly cheered when that happened but she was only on for a few seconds and then - puff!- the film was over. It seems to me that they must have had some feedback about the lack of our scaly friend and so decided to put her in at the last minute and in the last minute as well. That just isn't good enough. I'm afraid i cannot recommend this film to anyone, both my children were disappointed and so was I.",Shrek 2

429,wtpoohbear,Very clever.,10,17 May 2004,"I was lucky enough to see a sneak preview of Shrek 2 tonight and I was very entertained by it. I was impressed that they were able to throw in a few surprises. I could see a couple of the jokes coming, but it didn't give them any less punch. The animation was definitely as good as, if not better than the first movie(which I thought was great). I thought the character voices were perfect for the new characters and I appreciated that the returning characters had the same voices as the first movie. In the first movie I enjoyed all the irreverence to classic fairy tails. This movie didn't limit itself to fairy tales, it grabbed from modern movies and pop culture. I don't often laugh out loud at movies, but Shrek 2 truly got me to laugh and laugh some more. Make sure you sit through the end - it's not Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party, but still cute.",Shrek 2
430,elkope,FUN FOR EVERYBODY,8,18 June 2004,"If you liked the first movie, you are going to like these one. But i think the movie its more enjoyable for the adults than for the kids. Most of the jokes have double sense and i doubt that the little ones can understand.Its not my kind of movies, but its fine to pass a good moment and forget of the daily stress.Its very original in its content and jokes, but i have my doubts, for how long are the writers going to last for writing and keep the same freshness if they want to continue with more parts.I think its a good moment to stop with this picture and don't continue with more parts, because its originality and impact its going to turn weaker every time and could finish in a mediocre and wasted formula.Its time to move on, and think in whole new concept for whole new picture.",Shrek 2
431,InJanuary,That's the ANIMATION,10,19 August 2004,"This is the best animation movie I have ever seen. Great dubbing and voices, wonderful soundtracks, everything is fine in this movie. I'm waiting for other movies of this series. Everybody must be see, and u will enjoy it. 3, 4 is coming with power of animation. and the green man return back as soon as possible...Thanks for works..",Shrek 2
432,howard-bennett,A grave disappointment,1,20 December 2004,"The original Shrek is one of my favourite films and one which I have enjoyed many times with my family. This movie is banal and unoriginal. The premise is weak and does not provide sufficient scope for plot development. The characterisations have not developed, the cast appears to be cruising and using Jennifer Saunders was a big mistake which shows how poor British character acting is compared to American. The movie references which worked before are unsurprising, un-entertaining and VERY self-indulgent. In short, this movie appears to have been developed by a committee which sought to work within the requirements of the formula of the first movie as it saw it and in its lack of understanding, produced something totally lacking the magic of the fist movie. This is the old, old story of art vs. commerce and this film is a salutory example of what can go wrong. Don't bother.",Shrek 2
433,erincole,I haven't laughed this much in a long time!,7,19 May 2004,"Wow, I just saw Shrek 2 (Wed, May 19) and it was great! I was a little apprehensive about a Shrek sequel since the first was so great and wrapped up so nicely at the end. Often, the sequels do not match up in this kind of movie and the plot tends to be thin. Shrek 2 is equally as good as the first one! The new characters are great, especially Puss in Boots. There are so many jokes and parodies of other movies and pop culture that I know I missed a lot of them because I was already laughing so hard. I need to see it again to catch them all! It is also a very clean movie, with no questionable material for kids to see. Many of the jokes will go over their heads, so this makes for a very entertaining movie for adults too. Several characters from the first one are back and are fun to see again. One of my favorites, the Gingerbread Man, is back and gets even more screen time! The plot is entertaining also, and ends with a good moral lesson like the first one did. We should all love others for who you they are and don't change to please others!! The use of popular music is also good and works well with the story. Of course, the animation is incredible and many times I forgot I was watching animation since it looks so much like live action. Also, make sure you stay during the credits because there's another short scene in there! I recommend it to anyone, and give it an 8/10!!!",Shrek 2
434,ohsweetie2003,It was still fun!,7,1 June 2004,"Okay so maybe the first was fantastic and this one wasn't. Then again the theatre was crowded and people were loud. The movie still has great characters and Antonio is wonderful as Puss N Boots. I loved the first, but I like this too. My 10 year old little brother thought it was just as good as the first, and is begging to see it again. I began to enjoy the movie more towards the end. The Godmother I Need A Hero performance was great! I laughed so hard that my cheek's hurt. The entire room filled with laughter. The image of the fairy godmother on a piano in a sparkling red dress was enough to bring a smile to anyone's face. The movie delivered its message clearly. The movie was great!",Shrek 2
435,martinledant,Don't try to think too far,10,27 May 2004,I think people are expecting way too mush from shrek 2. It's just a bunch of things that appeals to our inner little child. They just used all those characters from fairy tales that every one of us are used to seeing in their normal context and gave them a new life. It just happens that their life is slightly different from the one we are used to seeing. And that what's funny. You don't have to put big humor or a really complicated plot to make it a good movie. There is irony all over the place. An ogre who is actually a really nice person compared to the bad mean ogre that eats children. This cat that is supposed to be really tough but who is actually making cute little eyes to persuade people. Pinnocio that is actually trying to hide that he is wearing a thong. When the donkey turns into a stallion. The god mother singing that song half naked on the piano. When the big ginger bread man is attracted by the big farbucks cup of coffee. Well I don't know guys. I think THIS is funny.I think this is a great movie. If you think it's not it's because the kid inside of you is dead and rotten. And that's sad.,Shrek 2
436,AsianRocker114,Excellent!,10,25 May 2004,"This movie is gleefully entertaining! I really like it and I would be hard pressed to find someone that disagreed. There's something for everyone in this movie! The Pinnochio bit had me dying!!! Anyway, despite all this, there's a moral theme just like the first one, it seemed to be most about love. But it's open to your interpretation. I think there are more subtleties to be gleaned from a second viewing. Go see it! It's great! There is so much in there, I walked out of the theatre thinking... I wonder if that's normal... but it was a feel-good movie and not only was I happy with how I walked out, those gags stuck with me until now. Why are you still here?! Go watch it!",Shrek 2
437,DeHahn,The second movie about Shrek and his friends,10,22 July 2004,"After Shrek and Fiona married in the first part, they now have to visit Fiona's parents who are ""not amused"" when they see their new son in law. Another Problem is Prince Charming. He and his mother, ""The Fairy Godmother"", planned that he and Fiona should marry. Shrek and Donkey get in trouble because Fiona's father hired a professional killer: ""The Puss in Boots"". Will there be a Happy End???You gotta look twice to see all the details (like all the signs in ""Far Far Away"": They played ""Lethal Arrow 4"" in the movie theater)",Shrek 2
438,heynowwanker,Fantastic Film,9,21 May 2004,"This is a gem of a film, a wonderful follow-up to the original. It's the best comedy I've seen this year and it transcends all age groups. Truly unique and something to be treasured. Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, and Eddie Murphy reprise their original voice-roles and do them 100% justice again. John Cleese, Rupert Everett, and Antonio Banderas are fabulous as well. The animation is splendid. The animators also use cleverly inserted pop culture references throughout the film. You really have to watch the film closely to see if you can catch them all. Pinocchio has a small role but he is absolutely hilarious. My two year old and 10 year old can't wait to see it again. For that matter, neither can my wife and I.",Shrek 2
439,SGCalgary,A must-see sequel !,8,20 May 2004,"Hi there !Well, I just come back from seeing Shrek 2. Like all of us would say, a sequel is always something you won't be quite sure, especially a comedy (forget about LOTR, that WAS written, as Harry Potter). But Shrek 2 has got some new type of jokes, and some touching moments. There was more about joking on the idea of falsified faerie stories on the first, but this one brings new jokes. A little repeating from the animated series movies, but well done. And the story isn't boring, as most of the sequels does. It's actually quite entertaining and the pieces are well placed.Well, there's not only good sides. It misses a little something. The first was about the surprise of the ogre-thing. The second uses it, but too much.And a little commentary to finish: what a « panachée » voice for Puss-In-Boots. A Spanish cat ! And he's so cute with his big black eyes !8/10Mathieu",Shrek 2
440,conniee,"truly excellent movie, funnier than the first",10,17 May 2004,"My family and I just saw Shrek 2 and it was hilarious. Puss in Boots stole the show. Much funnier gags than the first one. This is one movie paying as much as movies are now is worth it. A must see and a must own when released on DVD. This is the movie to see for all those who wonder what happens when characters live happily ever after. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz do a superb job bringing back their roles. The new characters are well done but especially Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas. The improvements in animation technology are amazing. The characters look like they could walk off the screen, very realistic. Most of the audience was almost rolling on the floor with laughter. A movie with jokes for young and old alike. Pay attention to every detail, they are worth it. Stay and watch the end credits too, don't rush away.",Shrek 2
441,mkscolari,Exceeded my hopes & expectations!,10,20 May 2004,"I seldom laugh out loud at a movie, but this one was an exception. So great to see familiar characters stretch to new heights in a cleverly crafted story. I did adore Shrek, but now can't wait to see Shrek 2 again & own it on DVD!!! Mike Myers is sooooo Shrek and Eddie Murphy still almost steals the show. Antonio Banderas' Puss'n Boots has his moments. The Fairy Godmother is great! I don't know who she is - will have to do a search on her. And please, everyone remember to stay through the credits to see one of the best scenes at the very end! So tell me when Shrek 3 is coming out??",Shrek 2
442,SeanH-7,"Wonderful, better than the original",9,8 June 2004,"This movie was super funny. At first I was kinda worried, because it did start off somewhat slow. However, it really picked up once they got to Far Far Away. Shrek 2 makes fun of so many movies, and it does it in a smart funny way. Puss n Boots was a wonderful addition, and I love all of the original people, especially Donkey. Donkey was so funny in this installment. However, I feel that the movie was really good because of all the wonderful side characters that they had, like the Gingerbread Man, Pinnocho, the In-laws and so on. Wonderful, so much better than the first, and the first was amazing. I can't wait till a third one comes out.",Shrek 2
443,maroonout33,"""funny and entertaining""",10,12 June 2004,"shrek 2 was funny, entertaining, and worth watching it. The story-line is not the best, it's kind of a run on of random occurrences,but it's still pretty decent. Go see shrek 2 it is better then the first! This is the perfect flick to take your girlfriend/boyfriend to. There is some controversial content, so i recommend ages 9+. This movie provides eddie murphy, mike myers and cameron diaz at their best. Most likely if you go to see skrek 2 in theaters it is not going to be very crouded in the theater, but I'm pretty sure that when it arrives at the video store it's going to be hard to get a hold of. Overall, I give shrek 2 a rating of an A-.",Shrek 2
444,fabioakasarno,Somehow I missed the Shrek bandwagon...thank god,4,15 June 2004,"I'm just not sure how these two movies have been so well received. The story line in the second installment was just downright poor. Shrek is the poster child for teen angst, while donkey's annoying characteristics still don't come off as being funny, they come off as being ANNOYING. Little things like the soundtrack for the film are equally as frustrating. When there is potential action unfolding on the screen I don't want to hear Smashmouth, Counting Crows or any Indie rock wannabee band distract me. The saving grace in Shrek 2 is the addition of Puss in Boots who thankfully steals the show. After getting bombarded with less than witty pop culture references, I can still smile a little thinking of Antonio Banderas as the voice of cat. Overall, this is a movie that lacks anything fresh, and I wish I could go back to the theater and take back my $7. 50 and donate it to the ""Please Don't Release Another Terrible Shrek Movie"" fund.",Shrek 2
445,gohaniam,"Good, but could have been better.",9,8 July 2004,"I personally thought it was a really good movie. Although the humor was good I thought that it got a bit old along the way. I think that they might have been trying to hard to make it funnier than the first one but i don't think it was. I also thought that it was a tad bit odd near the end when the Muffin Man made the gigantic Gingerbread Man. I mean the guy must have one big freaken oven and a whole lot of dough, which doesn't make any sense because he had like a normal size house that could definitely not have that big of oven unless he had a huge backyard or his basement was an underground cavern that went on for miles. Overall I must give this movie a 7/10 mainly because I think they could have done a lot better.",Shrek 2

Judging from all the ""ahhhs"" in the movie theater I would say most people will agree from me.If you haven't seen this movie then believe me you're missing out in gr8 animation as well as gr8 comedy.Even my best friend,who rarely goes to movies and prefers deep movies that you puzzle about for hours, enjoyed it like crazy!For all those who have had a bad week and need to be cheered up!!",Shrek 2

449,soaper84,It's really a... romantic drama who tries to be funny.,1,14 September 2004,"By now most people who were fans of the first film has seen part two so I won't bother to tell the storyline. Anyway. I rented the first tilm this weekend without a clue that the sequel was just showing up on the moviescreen around here and I thought the first ""Shrek"" was just great (just like It was the other times I've seen it). So when a friend told me today that he was going to the movies to see Shrek 2, I gladly decided to tag along.I was disappointed.What I found on the screen was not a half-goofy comedy for all ages with great characters, a big bag full of charm and a wonderful storyline, as was the case with the first film, but a sort of romantic-drama that tries hard to be funny, but just does not cut it. (or did they try? Maybe It wasn't meant to be funny at all, hmm?) And the result? A sequel of a comedy (or ""family entertainment"" if you want) devoted almost entirely to drama and love trough tough times. Where did the comedy that was so clear in the first film go then? Well. It's scattered all over the film really, but its in such small dozes that you almost don't recognize them before they're gone. For example: When you look around you see a limousine-wagon, fast food restaurants, commercials and modern words. What happened to the fairy-tale?Was there a point? (some people in the audience chuckled over those I admit)Maybe they meant ""Well. In the last film it was a fairy-tale, so lets make it a little more modern and spin some jokes on that, haha""?As I sat there amongst the other ticket holders I sometimes noticed what they laughed at and what not as I was myself laughing quietly at a sentence made by ""Donkey"" (Eddie Murphy). Yes. It was mostly Donkey that made the humor in the film, but he wasn't as irritating-and-at-the-same-time-charming as he was in the first Shrek. Now he was more dull, gray and kinda irritating (without the charming-part, but still likable). I must say that Donkey ruled the first Shrek, but he did have a close competition from all the other main characters, Shrek, Fiona and Lord Farquaad. They supported each other well. Which brings me to my next point: I enjoyed Antonio Banderas roll as ""Puss In Boots"" and I was wondering during the film, where the introduction of the character would pay off.It didn't happen. Well. Sure. He was a slick character (and for another thing the best character that was introduced in the film), but honestly without a real purpose. I mean, the story didn't rely on ""Puss"" in any way. You could easily scip him.., But I suppose they wanted another character to help Donkey out on the laughter-factor. Here we have Donkey and Puss and they both ram at each other with mean remarks as they try to be the one who's closest to Shrek.When we turn to the star of the film: No other than Shrek himself. I can understand that he's having a rough time with his romantic issues and Fiona's fathers opinion of him, but I must say... He's not playing along. He's not even working with the other characters to make it entertaining. He's well... Grumpy, serious, angry and sad. Keep in mind that I already explained that I realize that he probably is that way because of the characters situation. That is not to say that he's incapable of action. Quite the contrary. He shows of with his seriousness of the situation at all time, but by the end I would just need a li-tt-le bit more (like the seriousness he showed off in the end of the first film) and I would've been going to sleep easier tonight,But seriously. Somebody please tell me that I'm not way out on this. I realize that most of my opinions are reflected on the difference between the first film and the sequel, and I understand if people tell me ""Its not the same film! It's a new film. Get over it! Its not suppose to be an identical film. Things are suppose to change in a sequel that makes the difference between the first film and the new one, wheater its a location, characters or plot."" Darn tutan I say and I assure everyone that I'm merely trying to point out my feelings on the film by using the first one as a sketch for a how a good movie of that kind and for that audience should be made and I'm not suggesting or badgering it's content, but rather the structure of it.I mean... Really... Shrek is a great film.Well... On with the character analysis. I didn't really like Fiona (Cameron Diaz) part in this film. Merely because she's so cut off I think. She was much more of a character in the first film. She smiled, she burped, she sang, she fought and had a real temper. Tough you got to learn more about her emotions, which is a good thing, she was more like a secondary-figure in this film after the point when Shrek went of with Puss and Donkey to try and solve their situation. She merely glimpsed by now and then just for us to know thats she's still alive and is bothered with the situation. (oh, god! I'm getting a headache. It's almost 5 AM, but I feel I must do this while the film is still fresh in mind. Please excuse possible misspelling.)There's so much things in the film that could have been made a lot better, landed on the clipping-floor or just not been made at all...If I dare say such a thing about a movie people probably have been working their asses off while producing (sigh). It kinda makes me feel bad for having an opinion, Well anyway- Let's just settle the matter with the fact that I don't think I'll be buying the DVD, ... but perhaps the first Shrek so I don't have to rent it anymore,Tough my statements here about the movie I DO recommend that If you're really a fan of the first SHREK It could be very interesting for you to know the whole story nonetheless. Besides, this might just be a film YOU'D enjoy.... even if I didn't.",Shrek 2

451,billmacaroni666,Shrek is Schlock,3,8 April 2005,"Contrary to the known world it seems, I disliked Shrek for the same reasons I love all Pixar films. Shrek 1 & 2, as with all Dreamworks animation, are bent on bombarding the audience with modern pop culture references ad nauseum -- partially because the creators believe such recycling is humorous, but also I suspect because they understand, smartly, that modern audiences desperately sop up pop references as a means of affirming their own image of themselves. They are hipsters, on the pulse of modern culture. You can't put one over on them. They feel smart when they recognize the reference. I find it embarrassing. Wheras Pixar create original characters, stories, settings and music, Dreamworks repetitiously offend by piling on cliché after cliché. I love Mike Meyers, I love Eddie Murphy and John Cleese, etc. etc. But I abhor Shrek. If you are a young child, it makes sense that you feel drawn to something to which you are accustomed. If you are an adult with any semblance of taste, go watch The Incredibles or Finding Nemo and LEARN something about storytelling and character execution. Long live Pixar. Shrek is for the unwashed masses. Good day to you.",Shrek 2
452,brodar01,Shrek,10,28 September 2005,this movie shrek two was so much better than the first one when i heard that they were realising a second one to this i though great this is going to be terrible but i had to go to the cinemas twice to see this movie and it was unbelievable my favourite bit in the movie was the evil cat as he was so intelligent and could do pretty much anything. i really wished that shrek and donkey stayed the way they were when they used that magic potion s they were very good looking i would rate this movie to anyone as it was so much better than the first one. my father who hates watching movies loved it as well and we were going out for tea and he wouldn't come until he finished watching the movie as he liked it so much as well.,Shrek 2
453,cubsfan753,Hilarious...,9,7 January 2006,"I went into Shrek 2 not knowing what to expect, but I laughed harder in this film than in anything I had seen in a very long time. The movie was jam packed with pop culture references and jabs at Disney...each one is right on. The voice cast is top notch- the additions of Antonio Banderas, Julie Andrews, and John Cleese were genius moves by the producers. This movie was really an ensemble effort, making it much funnier than the original.The story is reminiscent of Guess who's coming to dinner? where Fiona takes Shrek home to meet her parents- the king and queen of the kingdom of Far Far Away. Needless to say, things don't go as planned and Fiona's father and Shrek do not get along. Sending Shrek and Donkey, along with their new friend Puss in Boots, on a whirlwind adventure to seek help from the Fairy Godmother and make things right. But the Fairy Godmother has some tricks up her sleeves too.If your one of the four people in America who haven't seen this movie, go watch. My only major criticism is that I couldn't hear all the jokes over everyone's laughter. Can't wait for Shrek 3.",Shrek 2
454,jamesforster97,BEST FILM EVER,10,17 January 2021,"Better then shrek 1. It is really friendly and nice and everyone should go watch it, especially the bit where they put the rings on their fingers cause that is my friend Liyahs (Logan) favourite bit",Shrek 2
455,nertoole,"Good, But not as good as the first",7,21 January 2015,"It's a good movie. I just don't think it's as funny or as creative as the first. Lets start with the story. You got all your returning cast members from the original, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, etc. Shrek goes to Far, Far Away to meet Fionas parents and to get their blessing. Unfortunately, Fionas parents aren't too thrilled that her and her husband, Shrek are and permanently ogres. In order to make Fionas parents happy, Shrek drinks a happily ever after potion so Him and Fiona can both turn human. After a few mishaps, Shrek and Fiona both realize that they can be happy, no matter how they look.I think the real weakness in this movie is the writing. Some of the jokes can be sorta clever, but when the jokes die, they really die. Or there's that joke that goes absolutely nowhere. I feel like there's a team of really good writers making clever jokes but then there's some other asshole who keeps throwing in unfunny ones. As for some parts, I'm not even sure if they're jokes or not. For example, there was this one time where Puss is reading the ingredients to a magic bottle or something, and then he realizes that Donkey is singing and trotting in place. I don't even get the joke... It's not like there's any punchline or anything, so I just don't get itSo final verdict, i don't hate it. I still think it's a (mostly) fun adventure with an endearing (yet overused) moral and fun characters",Shrek 2
456,blazeandphillies,Most hyped ending of all time,10,13 May 2016,"Let me start this off by saying, shrek 2 has the greatest ending in film history. I have never been more hyped in my life, then I was when I was in that theater and fairy godmother started singing I need a hero. That song was not only a perfect fit for the movie, but a perfect song to describe what I needed at the time. At that time I was a seven year old with cancer worse than Deadpool's, but unlike DeadPool I didn't have treatment that turned me into a superhero. Instead, I had Shrek, I can honestly say Shrek saved my life, soon after seeing the movie my cancer got oggred and was cured. Shrek 2 is so good I recently failed a chemistry test because all I could think about was the sacrifice of the giant gingerbread man, who was killed by the Knights when they poured the hot milk on him. Why did he do this? For Shrek. He died for Shrek, so that Shrek could find Fiona and reunite with her. While Jesus died for our sins, the giant gingerbread man died for Shrek, which in my opinion is an even more important and noble action. Shrek 2 also has the greatest bonus feature in the history of DVD bonus features, with the feature Far Far away idol. This feature is literal perfection, even includes a guest cameo in that of Simon Cowell. The film also starts off with an amazing gag that most of you probably missed. When Prince Charming goes to the castle expecting to find Fiona and comes to find that the hungry wolf is there instead, if you are looking closely you can see that the wolf is reading pork illustrate, that has a pig in swimsuit, similar to that of sports illustrated swimsuit edition. Knowing all of this, we can only imagine what the wolf was planning on doing if Prince Charming didn't interrupt ;). The only problem with the film is that there was no running of Jew, which was featured in Borat which came out 2 years later, also it would have made perfect sense for the running of the Jew, as Shrek is often making fun of Disney princesses, and since Walt himself was not a fan of Jews, why not throw it in there. If there ever is a Shrek 5 hopefully they throw that in there. In conclusion Shrek 2, is the greatest comedy of all time, and by far the greatest Shrek Film. P.S There will be no Shrek the third review, as that film is more disappointing than the Star Wars prequels, and it makes my cancer come back every time I talk about it, and it should really suck Donkey's right nut. P.S.S That Punk boy from the Shrek is love, Shrek is life video, can go off himself. The events described in the video are completely false and was all CGI, nothing was real. It's bullcrap, that the video has tarnished our hero legacy's because some punk kid can use cgi for a video. If the kid from that video is reading this, I hope fairy godmother comes to your house singing I need a hero, as the giant gingerbread man walks down your street destroying your neighborhood, and than eats you when he finally finds your punk ass.",Shrek 2
457,hammiema_cicra,A real treat,10,18 August 2005,"Shrek 2 is a great and unbelievable film. I have rarely in my time seen any sequel better than the original, but Shrek 2 is an exception beyond all exceptions. When Shrek in invited to the palace to meet Fiona's parents, well let's just say he didn't pass their test with flying colors. New hilarious characters are introduced like ""Prince Charming"" who was supposed to have rescued Fiona but ran a little late apparently. The ""Fairy Godmother"" who is not so 'Happily Ever After' like in Cinderella. And who can forget 'Puss in Boots"" the cutest yet fiercest cat in the kingdom. Of course naturally ""Donkey"" hasn't changed one bit, well emotionally at least (don't want to spoil the surprise) and Fiona is back to her old self (you'll see what I mean). All in all ""Shrek 2"" is one of the rare films these days, that the whole family can sit down, kick off their shoes, grab some grub and settle down together for a real laugh and treat which will leave you in stitches.",Shrek 2

459,Takma-rierah,Much better than the first,8,5 September 2005,"This one was MUCH better than the first.While the first seemed to be mostly based on bathroom humor and grossness, the second has genuinely intelligent humor, and although there are still moments of regression, it's managed in a way that doesn't leave the second nearly as disgusting as the first sometimes seemed to be.The humor of ""Shrek 2"" will appeal to most adults more than the first did.Overall, it was quite the great success.However, the ""Far Far Away Idol"" has rather left me disappointed. There are some singers said as being ""good"" that don't quite deserve that adjective, and some regarded as being ""bad"" that are really quite good.",Shrek 2
460,grace-brown,Stroke of Genius,10,6 September 2005,"I first saw this film on a DVD on the TV in my bedroom, and after watching it I realised what a mistake that was. A film of this quality should really be seen on the big screen for you to appreciate it for all its worth. After seeing Shrek when it first came out I wasn't sure if Shrek 2 could live up to the expectations . . . . I was gladly proved wrong and laughed all the way through this movie. For me, the stroke of genius in this film was the mighty Jennifer Saunders. She bought the whole film to life and stole every scene that she was in!! It was so refreshing to see one of the best villains I have seen in a film and somehow still manage to love her character (because she brought a certain ""Edina"" quality to the whole thing). If you've seen it you will know what I mean! her singing voice was out of this world and I had to buy the soundtrack after hearing her belt out Holding Out For A Hero.",Shrek 2
