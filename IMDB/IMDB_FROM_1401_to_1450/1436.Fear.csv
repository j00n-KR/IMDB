0,Leofwine_draca,Notable only for the youthful stars,4,4 September 2020,"Oddly enough, the late-stage psycho-thriller FEAR - shot two years prior to its release - is notable only for featuring very early performances from three names who would come to dominate the world of American film and television. Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon and Alyssa Milano are all present here and very fresh-faced in ther roles, although you wouldn't know it as they give assured performances that make you feel like they've been acting for yonks. A shame the plot that they're given is so hackneyed then, in which a tale of teenage love gradually develops into a murderous obsession. It's a distinctly average style of production, rather dated and lacking in credible depth; the only real drama comes at the STRAW DOGS-derived climax, and even that screams of cliche.",Fear
1,SnoopyStyle,sexy Afterschool Special,6,11 November 2013,Nicole Walker (Reese Witherspoon) is a rebellious teen angry with his father (William Petersen) and particularly his new wife (Amy Brenneman). She parties with her best friend Margo Masse (Alyssa Milano) and falls for bad boy David McCall (Mark Wahlberg).This is an afterschool special with sexed up Reese and Alyssa to hook the public. There is no surprises and no drama. This thing might as well be on autopilot. She goes out with the bad boy and the bad boy turns out to be a bad boy. What a twist! It's a mistake to start Mark Wahlberg off creepy. The character really needs a more innocent facade. I'm willing to buy the afterschool special storyline. But you've got to earn the drama. This didn't earn anything close to that.,Fear
2,claudio_carvalho,Great Story and Performances,7,22 December 2013,"The sixteen year-old teenager Nicole Walker (Reese Witherspoon) has moved to the house by the lake of her father, the architect Steve Walker (William Petersen), to live with her stepmother Laura (Amy Brenneman) and her brother Toby (Christopher Gray). Her best friends are Margo Masse (Alyssa Milano) and Gary Rohmer (Todd Caldecott) that study with her in the high school. When Nicole meets David McCall (Mark Wahlberg) in a night-club, she has a crush on and dates him. David becomes obsessed by Nicole and one day he sees her friend Gary kissing and hugging her and he hits him. Nicole breaks with him but David continues to follow her. Steve decides to investigate the young man and he finds that he is an orphan that has spent most of his life in reformatories. The hell breaks loose in Nicole's life when David kills Gary and trashes the Mustang of her father. Steve breaks in his house and destroys everything inside. Now David and his gang go to Steve's house to payback.""Fear"" is a good movie, with great story and performances. I saw this movie for the first time in the late 90's on VHS and last Friday I saw it again on DVD, and the plot seems to be more realistic in the present days of violence and fear in many worldwide cities. This is also a great opportunity to see Reese Witherspoon very young and cute, and Mark Wahlberg perfect performing a manipulative psychopath. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Medo"" (""Fear"")",Fear
3,kosmasp,Close and dangerous,5,2 September 2017,"You have quite a few established actors in this. The original Manhunter (the first one to face Hannibal Lecter, who was not played by Anthony Hopkins), a witch or the daughter of (Alyssa Milano), a very young Reese Witherspoon and of course Mark Wahlberg, who plays completely against expectations in this one.Since this was over 20 years ago, they all do look very young. The theme of the movie is very simple: dangerous first love. A father will always try to be as protective as possible. But is he right to do so in this case? A girl will revolt against people trying to keep her down. Even someone who seems like the quietest naive little girl. Also a very innocent looking one like the one Reese is playing, might be tempted by someone strong looking like Mark. You can see where this is going, so it is predictable, but still somewhat fun, if you let yourself enjoy it",Fear
4,Sleepin_Dragon,It's entertaining still.,7,11 September 2020,"Nicole is a very sweet, innocent girl, she falls for a very handsome, fit guy called David, unfortunately David turns out to be a head case, poor, naive Nicole struggles to escape the unwanted attentions of the crazed guy.One aspect of this film I really did like, even more so that it's from 1996, is that Nicole doesn't try to change him, she had the sense to try and get away from him.Interesting to see a young, bright eyed Reese Witherspoon, she's learned her craft since these days it's fair to say. Mark Wahlberg is terrific here, he really does make the movie, you of course get to see his muscles (When don't you!)It's a very strong, dramatic ending, perhaps the best bit of the film. That's the way to do it.",Fear
5,rmax304823,Do You Know Where Your Daughter Is?,5,2 September 2017,"For most of its length, ""Fear"" is a teen movie. Nice sixteen-year-old blond girl from bourgeois family (Witherspoon) is doing well enough except for a bit of irritation because her father (Peterson) objects to her school dress one morning. And it has to be admitted that she looks like a little girl's doll with a mini-skirted frock, white bobby sox, and Mary Jane shoes. I know I'm getting these terms all mixed up but bear with me. There is also her stepmother (Brenneman) whom Witherspoon resents. Witherspoon's best female friend is Alyssa Milano, whom every high schooler should have -- or have had -- as a close friend, especially me. Milano is mischievous but fundamentally sound.Enter handsome bulked-up Mark Wahlberg, experienced, soft spoken, silky, full of concern for Witherspoon, and a raving maniac underneath all that muted politesse, but that comes later. This gracious young man comes home with Witherspoon to ""meet the family,"" a necessary step in ordinary courtship, but Dad doesn't like him, not even at first meeting, when Wahlberg shakes Dad's hand and calls him ""sir."" Later, after Peterson intuits an outburst of violence from the kid, he REALLY perks up, his Darwinian points quivering.Witherspoon too, sporting a black eye, tells Wahlberg she wants nothing more to do with him, but Wahlberg's apology is passionate and seduces her. That's before he gets her off on the roller coaster, sneaks into her bedroom, and deflowers her. That sets the tone for the rest of the teen movie section. Two, or maybe three more times, he violates her trust and she forgives him tearfully until finally it's over for good. I sobbed like a baby.Now, the rest of the movie -- say, the last twenty minutes. Peterson happens to be an architect and has built his home with enough safety features to make Castle Machrae pale with envy. And Wahlberg, barred admittance, rounds up half a dozen hooligan buddies and attacks the fortress. If you want to see it done horrifyingly right, catch ""Straw Dogs"" or even ""The Birds."" Or, if you want the entire floor plan laid out before you at feature length -- louche man threatens and attacks one of those imaginary happy families -- try the 60s version of ""Cape Fear."" The most impressive thing about the movie is how YOUNG everyone looks. Scarcely a wrinkle in the entire cast. Wahlberg gives a decent performance and so, surprisingly, does just about everyone else. Amy Brenneman is memorable as Witherspoon's perceived rival for Peterson's affection, and she has virtually nothing to do but stand around and bystand, offering occasional suggestions and comments that do no more than reflect common sense.",Fear
6,BA_Harrison,"With an ending like that, how could I not enjoy it?",8,19 March 2012,"Over the years, I've developed quite an aversion to Mark Wahlberg for various reasons: the guy was the front-man for quite possibly the suckiest boy-band of the 90s; he speaks with an irritatingly soft voice; his hair is crap; he starred in the awful Four Brothers, dreadful Planet of the Apes and dreary The Yards; he got to have on-screen sex with Heather Graham and Julianne Moore in Boogie Nights, and in Fear, he gets to break-in a jailbaitalicious Reese Witherspoon and screw a slutty Alyssa Milano. Tell me, what's to like about the guy?Fortunately, in Fear, where Wahlberg plays despicable psycho David, who makes life absolute hell for pretty schoolgirl Nicole Walker (Witherspoon), her friends and family, a general disdain of the actor, compounded with a hatred for his character, makes this movie an all the more intense and enjoyable experience: after having Witherspoon and Milano lounge around in bikinis, Milano bending over in a very short skirt, step-milf Laura Walker (Amy Brenneman) in a sexy one-piece, Witherspoon orgasming (with a little help from David) while riding a roller-coaster, Gary's neck snapped like a twig, and The Walker's pet dog Kaiser's decapitated noggin pushed through its dog-flap during a tense siege/home invasion, what better way for director James Foley to end his film than by launching Wahlberg through a first storey window to land face-down on the rocks below?",Fear
7,dbdumonteil,Beware of orphans!,2,28 May 2003,"SPOILERS That could be the obnoxious moral of this story.And long live the family !When a whole family is involved,any suspense disappears.What could happen to these nice people?Which is less likeable is the necessity to find victims somewhere else:if you're not part of the Family,they make sure you die :it's a wonder that Margot survives (and she was a naughty girl at that in the first part!).But as for the gentle boyfriend,the cops who come to the rescue ,the dog of the family and of course the villain and his pack ,the die is cast.There's one interesting moment  and you think that things will take off:the scene where Wahlberg insults Petersen indicates what a heterical movie this could have been.Instead we have a humdrum work,barely made-for-TV quality.The main character is an orphan,and for the script writers, this accounts for his perversity:nobody tries to see more .But he acts as a expiatory victim:the family ,who had problems at the beginning ,comes out of this ordeal with increase stature.Mindless and irresponsible.",Fear
8,BandSAboutMovies,Awesome cheese,7,3 June 2019,"James Foley has an interesting IMDB resume, with films from Reckless, At Close Range and Glengarry Glen Ross to Who's That Girl (he also directed Madonna's videos for ""Live to Tell"", ""Papa Don't Preach"", and ""True Blue""), Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed. As I've always said, there's a fine line between arthouse and grindhouse. Fear is a movie that despite its bigger budget pedigree and future A-list stars has one foot surely planted in the grime of exploitation. And that's why I kinda love it.Nicole Walker (Reese Witherspoon) is sixteen and living in the midst of a turbulent blended family between her father (William Petersen) and new mother (Amy Brenneman). In my strange head, I've shipped that Petersen is really his character from Manhunter, starting over again in life as anything but a cop.That said - Nicole is a wannabe bad girl, sneaking into bars with real bad girl Margo (Alyssa Milano) when she meets David McCall (Mark Wahlberg). He's gorgeous and charming and says all the right things. But her dad hates him immediately. There's an undercurrent of family love in this film - it's never shoved in your face, but there are hints of it, that Nicole's father is perfect a bit too protective, a bit too defensive of her when his wife says she looks like a CENSORED.Keep in mind, every single time you hear The Sundays' cover of ""Wild Horses,"" you're getting a love scene, including one where David's hand finds its way between Nicole's thighs on a rollercoaster. Oh Fear - you understand the movie that you ought to be so well.Soon, David shows his true nature, keeping Nicole out too late and assaulting one of her friends when he thinks the guy is trying to get with his girl. He even gives Nicole a black eye which, oddly, brings her together with her stepmother, which is a troubling narrative when you start to think about it too much.Of course, she takes him back and even when her parents demand that she not have visitors when they leave town, she gives him the code to their house so they can make love. Daddy, however, can't trust the guy - even if the stepmother does, allowing him to help with her gardening - and discovers that his background is full of lies.Everything has to fall apart. Nicole watches Margo smoke crack at a party and sees David take her off to a bedroom for some lovemaking. In my favorite scene in the film, Margo tells Nicole's little brother that she can't wait until he grows up so she can ravage him - he's eight - before the bomb gets dropped that Nicole knows she's been with her man.David becomes obsessed with Nicole, tattooing his own chest with the words NICOLE 4 EVA in a scene that should be watched over and over again. He also goes off, choking out Margo, killing that gentleman who dared to hug Nicole and cornering her in a mall bathroom. Then he goes further, destroying her dad's Mustang with the graffiti ""Now I've popped both your cherries!""Her dad replies by breaking into David's house, where he finds a shrine to his daughter.Once David discovers that dad has been to his house, he responds in the only language he knows: abject violence, turning this movie into a teenage Last House on the Left. It starts with the beloved family dog, Kaiser, being beheaded and only gets worse from there. Sure, things turn out fine, but wow, getting there will necessitate years of therapy for everyone.Universal Pictures is currently working on a re-imagined version of this film with more of a female perspective. Here's hoping it isn't afraid to go too far, with a maniacal Donnie Wahlberg screaming ""Let me in the CENSORED house!"" Seriously, he was never better than he is in this movie, just a vision of complete young love gone wrong.",Fear
9,hitchcockthelegend,Fear can hold you prisoner,7,6 June 2014,"Fear is directed by James Foley and written by Christopher Crowe. It stars Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon, William Petesen, Alyssa Milano and Amy Brenneman. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Thomas Kloss.One of the number of psycho-sexual thrillers that surfaced in the 80s and 90s, Fear has the narrative hook that it involves teenagers. Witherspoon is the girl who invites drifter David McCall (Wahlberg) into her life, only to find he's as unstable as unstable can be. Director Foley and his team then produce a film that pretty much cribs from a number of other similar themed movies. All of the key scenes will be instantly familiar to genre film watchers, and unfortunately the plot twists and turns come as no surprise.However, in spite of the lack of originality in structure and narrative thrust, Fear is never dull, not even when Wahlberg is wistfully looking into Witherspoon's eyes like a love sick puppy. Suspense is on hand for the big finale, which unfolds with kinetic brutality, and it's also nice here to find that some thought has gone into the characterisations of those in peril. Kloss' photography around the various Seattle locales is vividly appealing, as is Burwell's music compositions, while the acting performances are all on the good side of good, with nobody harming the balance of the piece.A teenage Cape Fear – cum – Straw Dogs - cum – Fatal Attraction, but good with it regardless. 7/10",Fear
10,Theo Robertson,Far Better Than I Expected It To Be,7,3 September 2005,"I had very low hopes for FEAR . I'd read the synopsis in the TV guide and the plot sounded like one of those psycho killer stalker from hell thrillers that were being churned out without any thought in the mid 1990s . Considering it starred singer Marky Mark , Reese Witherspoon and William Petersen who's a rival to Eric Roberts in the straight to video / cable TV movie stakes I didn't think this was going to be up to much While not being a classic thriller FEAR certainly did hold my attention , probably because much of the characterisation is credible . All too often in this genre the actor or actress playing the villain really goes to town showing the audience what a bad ass they are thereby parodying the role . Mark Wahlberg as David is very restrained for the most part which makes David and credible character and his on screen chemistry with Reese Witherspoon's Nicole is believable , you can believe these two characters are genuinely in love with one another something that is all too rare in this type of movie I should also point out that much of the movie revolves around the interaction of Petersen's Mr Walker who is concerned about his daughter's relationship with David . You can't blame the guy for wanting what's best for his offspring and it enhances the credibility of the story . It's refreshing to have a more thoughtful approach to this type of genre because if people start turning up dead after 15 minutes then things start to get silly , so the violence is kept to a minimum until almost at the end of the movie which does suffer something of a plot hole because no one seems to have a mobile telephone at readily hand and don't tell me professional people didn't have mobile phones in 1996 . Also watch out for references to STRAW DOGS , THE SHINING and NOSFERATU at the climax Even if you're burned out on those 90s stalker from hell thrillers you could do worse than watch this on a wet Friday evening",Fear
11,Hey_Sweden,Predictable but still engrossing.,7,28 January 2013,"Referred to by its own producer, Brian Grazer, as a ""Fatal Attraction"" for teens, this slick thriller holds no surprises but is still reasonably good visceral entertainment. Reese Witherspoon plays Nicole, a Typical Teen with an Overprotective Dad, Steve (William Petersen). Nicole chances to meet a hunky stranger named David (Mark Wahlberg, in one of his earliest starring gigs) and they enter into a passionate relationship, only for Nicole to realize that every suspicion that her dad has about her boyfriend is correct: the guy's a brutal, controlling thug. And he naturally doesn't take kindly to being dumped. Simply put, this is the kind of cretin who simply won't be denied what he wants. And he'll kill anybody to get it. ""Fear"" does benefit from very capable direction by James Foley (""Glengarry Glen Ross""), and impressive widescreen photography. This story does move along quite well without getting bogged down in any sort of filler. It's also quite sexy, to boot: Nicole and David have some steamy couplings along the way. The action gravitates right toward the kind of final showdown that we know from the start is going to be inevitable. As it happens, Steve foolishly gives Davids' equally seedy goon friends all the motivation they need to launch an assault on the family home. The movie is certainly well cast and all of the performances are effective. Also among the actors are Alyssa Milano as Witherspoons' friend and Amy Brenneman as the dads' new lady friend. Witherspoon is appealing and Wahlberg is convincing as the lovestruck antagonist. Overall this works pretty well at manipulating its audience and getting them all cranked up. The big finale is reasonably exciting and has some brutal moments. While this might not be innovative stuff in any way, it does do its job, and delivers the expected thrills. Seven out of 10.",Fear
12,preppy-3,Above average psycho thriller,7,20 December 2000,"Nice, innocent teen Nicole (Reese Witherspoon) falls for handsome, muscular, soft spoken David (Mark Wahlberg) not knowing he's a psycho who wants her--forever. Good thing she's got a nice, muscular, protective father (William Petersen). OK, it's no masterpiece and the plot is very familiar, but I was never bored. It's well-directed (especially a roller coaster ride), has beautiful scenery and architecture (look at the house where Witherspoon lives with her family) and a script that, if not always credible, never stops moving. The last 20 minutes really rock. A little unpleasant at times though. As for the acting--Witherspoon is OK. At times, she's totally believable--other times she's not. And she's obviously over 17. Petersen is very good playing the understanding, protective dad. A nice, understated performance. Mark Wahlberg is (surprisingly) very good as the psycho. He plays the nice guy and the evil guy very effectively. REALLY nice bod too--what a chest! But he needs some serious voice lessons--his Boston accent kept creeping in. So, a pretty good thriller. You could do worse.",Fear
13,Uriah43,A Psychological Thriller,6,20 May 2014,"One day two high school students named ""Margo Masse"" (Alyssa Milano) and ""Nicole Walker"" (Reese Witherspoon) decide to check out a nightclub together. When they get there Nicole meets a young man named ""David McCall"" (Mark Wahlberg) and falls head over heels for him. However, underneath his smooth manner is a deeply disturbed person who resorts to violence at the least provocation. But what really sets him off is the thought of not having Nicole and his insane fear of losing her which only exasperates the situation even further. Anyway, rather than disclosing the rest of the story I will just add that as a psychological thriller this one definitely had some good points. I liked the performance of William Peterson (as Nicole's father ""Steve Walker"") and Mark Wahlberg but unfortunately, the first 30 minutes or so started off a bit too slow and the ending was much too simple and abrupt for me to rate it higher than I have. Slightly above average.",Fear
14,FlashCallahan,Save some hot water for your father....,7,15 March 2015,"When she and her best friend, Margo, go out to a party one night, Nicole meets mysterious David, who she ends up getting together with. After a couple of weeks, Nicole realises that David is becoming possessive and gets very jealous when she talks to other men. David beats up one of Nicole's male friends because he's seen walking Nicole home. When she ends up breaking up with David, he's not happy, and does everything to try and get her back, when that doesn't work, he and his friends break into Nicole's home.......When this film was first released way back in '96, i thought it was a great thriller. After all, it was the nineties, and we'd been spoilt with these psycho type films earlier on in the decade, and hadn't had a decent one since Unlawful Entry.Well, my movie tastes have diversely changed in nearly twenty years, and I wanted to see if it held up as much as I'd hoped. Well it has, and it hasn't. Wahlberg and Witherspoon are an age away from this, and unfortunately in some scenes, Wahlberg is laughably wooden rather than sinister, his David just isn't edgy as I thought he once was, more autonomous.But it's suitably silly, looks really good, and you could stick a pin in the film the moment when you, Petersen and everyone else knows that David is a bad egg. It's one simple line.'Nicole, get me a coke'Cue the dramatic incidental music, and the look from Petersen, as if to say 'he didn't say please!!!!!! Good heavens Nicole.....Fear for your life!!!!'But, with all these shortcomings, its a lot of fun, Petersen is brilliant as usual, and it gets very Nast in some scenes.If you've seen the majority of these nice people turning psycho movies, then you know what's going to happen, when it's happening, why it's happening, and how it's going to end.And I wouldn't have it any other way....",Fear

Even though the plot is not that original, it works very well because of the cast and the way it is told. Even though this is a teen movie, I think adults can watch it as well.I think almost everyone has been in love or lust at some time as a teenager. You notice when on the rollarcoaster how David gets sort of intimate with Nicole and the symbolism of the movements on the coaster represents her emotions, she knows she loves him and he loves her too. Not only that, but he is the one who is going to probably take her virginity too. Who hasn't felt that way, and got excited about it? So, you can relate to this movie in one way or another.The acting really brought the whole movie together. It could have been a big flop, but it wasn't.

18,=G=,"Obvious, predictable, mechanical, and mediocre.",6,14 July 2001,"""Fear"" is a mediocre suspense/thriller about a teenage daughter (Witherspoon) who is terrorized by an exboyfriend (Wahlberg). An ordinary and predictable formula flick, ""Fear"" goes through the motions mechanically, obviously manipulated for maximum effect.

Just finally I decided to sit down and watch it all and I must say overall ""Fear"" is a pretty decent mind thriller. It's theme fits well with teenage love obsession and the stalker crisis. And the cast here is well known it features some of the early work for most of them before they would go on to TV fame(Brenneman, Milano, and Petersen) and movie stardom(Wahlberg and Witherspoon). Set in Seattle, Washington a teenage girl the innocent and pretty Nicole(in one of Reese's earliest roles)lives with her father Steve(William Petersen)and stepmother Laura(Amy Brenneman)and Nicole has a good loving family life yet her parents are to overprotective and she starts to give into the pressure of her peers especially from her best friend the free spirited and sleazy Margo(the hot Alyssa Milano). It's upon their partying and club going that Nicole meets a young and innocent and nice talking young man named David(Mark Wahlberg). Yet appearances and personalities can be deceiving as after David seduces Nicole and she loses her innocence and develops a false trust surely enough David begins a violent obsession with her. Her family sees it and warns her, eventually this leads to drama all concluding with violence and a hostage situation with Nicole's family that was brought on by David and his thug friends. Yet in the end Nicole will grow to learn love is blind as she faces her fear.

21,sddavis63,"Not Especially Creative, But Well Done Nevertheless",6,4 October 2012,"There's a lot about ""Fear"" that's pretty cliché. The charming boyfriend who turns out to be a controlling, violent, psychopathic, obsessive guy who can't let go of the girl he's ""fallen in love"" with in spite of the fact that neither she nor her family want him around anymore. I can't say that struck me as particularly creative, nor did I find the bulk of the story especially interesting. It does, however, have some things going for it.First, I have to give credit to Drew Barrymore and Mark Wahlberg. Setting aside the fact that both were a little older than the characters they were playing, they were quite good in their roles as the young & naive Nicole and the charming psychopath David who sweeps her off her feet. Both were in the very early stages of their respective acting careers, but the lack of experience didn't show. They were convincing. The rest of the cast didn't really measure up to their standards, but the characters were interesting enough. I could certainly relate to William Petersen as Nicole's dad as he gets more and more concerned about this relationship his daughter is having, even though for some reason Petersen didn't really strike home with me in the role. And I have to say that although the movie almost lost me with the silly scene where David tattoos ""Nicole 4 Eva"" on his own chest, and while most of the story really didn't make that much of a connection with me, the last 20 minutes or so turns out to be a pretty good ride. It also is pretty standard for this kind of movie - as Nicole's entire family ends up doing battle with David and the bad guys, etc., etc., but it was very well done and exciting.This isn't a bad movie. It's perhaps a bit too much driven by clichés and a storyline that isn't very original, but it's well made and it has enough to keep the viewer interested. (6/10)",Fear
22,gridoon,First half is great; then film degenerates.,6,24 February 2002,"For about an hour, ""Fear"" is a way-above-average thriller. The buildup is slow and careful, and the acting in every major role is just superb: Whalberg is subtly scary, the lovely and talented Reese Witherspoon will surely melt many hearts, and Petersen is solid as the caring, rather conservative father (in fact, the film has a rather conservative point of view, but never mind). Some scenes are played so naturally that you forget you're watching a ""horror"" film, and ""Fear"" becomes a compelling drama.Unfortunately, in the final 20 minutes or so, the filmmakers decide to abandon any pretense of realism, and to turn the movie into something resembling a ""Night of the Living Dead"" knockoff, with punks replacing zombies (others have mentioned ""Straw Dogs"" here, but I haven't seen that one.)

Peeking inside David's pad, a drug den, Nicoel's sees David and his gang partying and shooting up with her friend, who looks like she's totally wiped out, Margo as the star attraction! It's when Steve after taking all the cr*p that David could dish out, on him and his family, goes to his gang's clubhouse drug den and sees among other outrages that he secretly, after having sex with her, stole his daughter's panties-to prove that he did it- that he finally loses his cool! Going berserk Steve wrecks the place together with all the drugs and drug paraphernalia thats there! It's after that when things, if they weren't already, really start to get out of hand in the movie. A mad as hell David, now seeking bloody revenge, and his gang get so carried away in their actions against the Walkers that they not only break into their well fortified home and but even go so far as to murder, if that's the word for it, the family pet and guard dog Kaiser by decapitating him!The final few minutes in the movie-with his gang members by then either killed or put to flight- has the by now totally deranged David go after, after almost beating him to death, Steve as his ""love"" Nicoel stands helplessly by in not being able to do anything to save of father from getting is brains blown out! It's that fear on Nicoel's part that has her do what she should have done much earlier in the movie! Stick it to her deranged psycho lover and stick it where it hurts most!",Fear
24,g-bodyl,A Great Horror Film!,8,18 May 2008,Fear is probably of the few horror films I will like. There is a dark taste about the film throughout the movie. This is about one girl played by Reese Witherspoon who likes an older guy played by Mark Wahlberg. Their relationship starts out nice and easy but problems do appear as the climax nears. Things finally escalate out of control. Mark's character and his friends endangers Nicole and her family. Will her life return to normal? You will have to find out. The acting was pretty good for the most part. The only time Mark annoyed me when he was cute before he turned mean. The music was great in the this film. There were great songs by Bush. The script and all of the technical stuff were good but not overwhelming. I liked this film better than most horrors. I rate this film 8/10.,Fear

Fear is quite an interesting film and not as bad as several reviews have panned it.The chemistry of both leads works and the overall plot is although quite simple and unoriginal (reminiscence of several older television series of the 1990's), for a psycho thriller as the intrigue is Mark Wahlberg's character and the shock and fear factor within the second half of the film.Even though Fear is predictable in some ways, what elevates the film is Wahlberg's overall presence. Little to no expectations for the film and it delivered several thrills that I was hoping for.

This is not a good movie by any means but it has positive things to underline. First, Wahlberg and Whiterspoon can act and their performances are the best thing about the movie. Milano is a delight to watch even that she's not very required in the movie but still shines in the few minutes she appears. Second and best of all; ""Fear"" goes directly to the point and makes it very easy to watch. *SPOILERS* There's nothing much to comment about ""Fear"" except for some infamous scenes like the dog's head, the drilling in the hand, and the three sex scenes.There are some Slasher elements a la Scream in this movie that in the time were very effective (stabbing, dog's head cut off, minimal gore, and a psycho killer) and worked very well in order to create a tense atmosphere. The ending is quite predictable and expected. The actors they chose perform surprisingly good. If the plot is not very interesting then the least you can expect is to feel some sympathy for the characters. Whiterspoon is tender and beautiful and you totally believe her when she has different feelings for her boyfriend. Wahlberg delivers a good performance as a crazed angry boyfriend. Come on, everybody feels anger jealous acts... this is exactly where I think that ""Fear"" succeeds. The movie is directed to a teenager audience that immediately feels similarities in their personal life with the events of it. The movie works in that aspect and there's no question about it.Watch it with minimal expectations and you will be surprised maybe a little.6/10",Fear

But when David's bad temper shows,Nicole's father wants her to stop seeing David.

30,drownnnsoda,Predictable But Entertaining.,7,14 August 2006,"""Fear"" is a solid but formulaic thriller about a teenage girl named Nicole (Reese Witherspoon). Nicole is your average teenager, and she lives with her architect dad, stepmom, and little brother in her father's custom-designed, secure home. While going clubbing one night with her friend Margo (Alyssa Milano), she meets David (Mark Wahlberg), who seems like a charming young man. She and David begin to form a relationship, despite her father's instinct that David is a dangerous guy. But David's true colors show after he beats up one of Nicole's male friends for giving her a friendly hug. As Nicole tries to distance herself from David, he keeps coming back, obsessed and determined to get her back. Nicole relapses for him again, but she finally decides to break it off after she sees him being abusive to Margo at his home, where he lives with a bunch of lowlife thugs. But David will have Nicole, and nothing less - even if it means killing her family and friends.All around, ""Fear"" is a pretty predictable movie. While it may be predictable, it is also quite entertaining and held my attention the entire way through. Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon did well in the film, especially since this is some of her much earlier work. Wahlberg was menacing as David, besides some of his angry facial expressions coming off as a little corny. The chemistry between the two worked well though. I found the story to be halfway decent, even though these ""romantic thriller revenge"" stories have been done before. The finale house-attack was great, it was definitely the best part of the whole movie. If you're a horror fan, this movie may be a little slow for you. It is mostly dramatic and slightly romantic through the first half, then David's true character is really established. Throughout the film the violence is kept to a minimum, but the ending sequence is actually quite gory. The only problem with the finale is there is one major plot hole - nobody has a mobile phone! It was 1996 and this is a rather wealthy family, you can't tell me they don't own cell phones! Other than that though, I thought the ending was really well done.Overall, ""Fear"" is a decent thriller. The story was interesting (if not a little bit predictable at times) and the acting was decent. For hardcore horror fans, this may be a little bit slow, but the ending made it worth it, for me at least. Not bad for the type of movie it is, quite entertaining. 7/10.",Fear

Nicole and her friend Margo (Milano) hangs out with David's criminal friends before Nicole finally wake up and sees David foe what he is. But then it is too late...Comment: Starts out as a sweet romantic drama that centers on the young tentative love. But there are some darker moments that warn about what is about to happen. Along the way the movie changes into a thriller with traces of horror. Unfortunately the movie is better as the romantic drama in the beginning than the thriller in the end, so the movie doesn't improve as it goes along. The cast is good, handles the change very well and consists mainly of (to me) known faces. Wahlberg is especially good as David, able to quickly change from sweet and lovable to obsessing and violent. All in all, slightly above average...6/10",Fear

""Fear"" has a quotidian plot: father and daughter issues, forbidden date, overly protecting parenting and so on. Even thought such subject has been used a lot of times in films, this is probably the best execution I've seen so far. James Foley gives a STRONG directing that makes you understand what the characters have been into, even if they're not saying it at all-- as an example, I mention the disco scene, in which you could easily see why Nicole surrounded so quickly. The atmosphere Foley builds is quite tense, helped by a very credible and convincing story, making you feel like it actually could happen to anyone-- except for the over-the-top violence in the outcome. Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon proved they can ACT, and they do it with style. Conversations are all intelligent, and spectator is able to relate either with daughter or father-- they both have their points. The photography directing is very nineties, and you don't see much difference from others of the period. All in all, this is a GREAT picture in many aspects, and another reason why we should respect the nineties in movies.",Fear

""Fear"", however, is quite effective for what it is and though nothing about it is top-rate as far as a great. Thriller goes, the combined package of what ""Fear"" offers still grabs hold of you and pulls you in for the ride. Even though this film might be categorized as a guilty pleasure, it still contains excellent early performances by Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon and a maturing Alyssa Milano. Production value is high, so this is definitely not a B-movie. The well-developed plot is a familiar one - good girl meets great guy who ends up being a psycho. But the lack of originality doesn't take away from the interesting progression of the movie. Directing, editing, writing and acting are still top notch.The plot of this movie was well written and the execution was great. Excellent plot development as Mark Wahlberg's character slowly escalated his aggressive and controlling behavior as opposed to similar movies such as ""The Boy Next Door"" which the controlling behavior was immediate. That slow progression of control and aggression made it much more realistic, along with the actions taken, In ""The Boy Next Door"" the ending was very dramatic but unrealistic in this type of character while the ending of Fear was made a lot more sense.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Fear

Plot follows the predictably overbaked beats, coasting only on director Foley's sure-handed direction of the empty-headed particulars, wrapping up in a heedless climax that's too silly to be exciting and not over-the-top enough to qualify as outrageous schlock. Wahlberg's smoldering psycho has no depth or personality; the actor (in his first leading role) exudes menace okay but earns only snickers and eyerolls when he feigns sincerity or charm--we had to wait until the following year's ""Boogie Nights"" to discover he had legitimate acting chops.

I'm not sure if it's nostalgia or if its actually awesome but the movie is so fun and holds up very well. It centers on a young woman named Nicole (Witherspoon) who discovers first love with the rebellious David (Wahlberg). At first he's charming, romantic and caring but than his mean streak comes out and he becomes obsessive. Obsessive to the point that he would do anything to be with her. It's an intense thriller and a touch lifetimey but the movie does touch on adolescence, growing up and first love. It all leads up to an edge of your seat finale. Wahlberg is sexy, psychotic and solid in the flick and really does show alot of promise, Witherspoon is pretty good but has some questionable moments. Alyssa Milano also makes quite an impression as her best friend Margot. Look the movie may be a bit predictable but there's a reason why they keep making movies like this. Because when they are done right they can be electrifying entertainment and this is done right.Budget: $6.5M

37,Screen_Blitz,"Love story goes deadly, with nothing original",6,1 March 2016,"A love story between two teens turns into a horrific nightmare in this romantic thriller directed by James Foley. Reese Witherspoon plays Nicole Walker, an average 16-year old girl in high school with great friends and loving parents. While attending a party with her best friend Margo (played by Alyssa Milano), she meets a handsome young named David McCall (played by Mark Wahlberg) who gives Nicole a ride home after the party. Nicole eventually develops a relationship with the seemingly heartthrob guy, much to the dismay of her overprotective father Steve (played by William Petersen) and their starts off fairly well. However, when David's love for Nicole soon grows into an obsession, a violent incident at school leads Nicole to believe that David may not be innocent as he appears to be. Nicole soon learns that David does not take ""no"" for an answer and will stop at nothing their relationship together, even if it involves harm of the ones she loves.""Together forever...or else"" is the tagline for this film, and it definitely resonates well with the film's plot as it deals with a young man's obsession with a beautiful girl that turns into deadly before she knows it. This teen version of the classic erotic thriller 'Fatal Attraction' puts Mark Wahlberg in his first role after his departure from the rap group Marky Mark and The Funky bunch, as a high school boy with a charming personality that masks his violent, sadistic nature. While his performance in this role is competent, he seems a bit miscasted. He doesn't look very threatening enough as the antagonist, even during the climax towards the end with the home invasion. As a result, his portrayal as the violent, obsessive young man doesn't feel very convincing. His performance as David McCall only feels believable when he and Reese Witherspoon begin their relationship and when they are sharing romantic moments together before his violent persona takes flight. After all, Wahlberg is only for portraying heroic roles in his films. On the bright side, the movie does manage to deliver some solid thrills and a few suspenseful moments to carry the dark atmosphere, while borrowing a few elements from other erotic thrillers. And the romance between Wahlberg and Witherspoon during the first half works fine, steering away from cheesy dialogue that many romance flicks are notorious for. The film doesn't offer much new to the table or anything to leave an worthwhile impression, but carries some entertainment value at least.Fear is a fine romance thriller that may appeal to teens as well as some adults, but nothing truly original nor overly clichéd should be expected here. This definitely isn't the most memorable in the resumes of the two main leads, but it is one worth checking out.",Fear
38,seymourblack-1,Family Tensions As Naive Girl Dates Psychotic Boyfriend,8,19 June 2015,"This movie is visually strong, suspenseful and extremely entertaining but the way in which it depicts family tensions is its greatest achievement. A teenage girl's relationship with a young man from the wrong side of the tracks soon sparks off numerous problems that are down to her father's over-protective instincts and the girl's natural rebelliousness but the dramatic possibilities are then heightened even further due to the specific dynamics that exist within the girl's reconstituted family.Nicole Walker (Reese Witherspoon) is the naïve 16-year-old who, after previously living with her mother, moves into her father's suburban home in Seattle. Steven's (William Petersen) an overworked architect who lives with his second wife Laura (Amy Brenneman) and her young son Toby (Christopher Gray). When Nicole and her high school classmate Margo Masse (Alyssa Milano) go to a local rave, Nicole meets David McCall (Mark Wahlberg) and is instantly attracted to him. He's exceptionally polite, softly spoken and seems very gentle and considerate. David instantly makes a positive impression on Laura and Toby when he visits their home but Steven instinctively takes a dislike to him. This naturally creates a rift between him and Nicole and makes her even more determined to continue the relationship.Things suddenly change one day when David sees Nicole hugging her school friend Gary (Todd Caldecott) and is overcome with jealousy and rage. In a sudden and violent outburst, he brutally attacks Gary and roughly pushes Nicole to the ground. After the attack, Nicole is left with a black eye and immediately stops seeing David. This incident reinforces Steven's negative feelings towards David but it isn't long before Nicole surprisingly rekindles the relationship. Steven is incensed and angrily forbids David from seeing his daughter again. David, however, is totally obsessed with Nicole and as his fury grows, the revenge he takes on the Walker family becomes progressively more violent until his actions eventually lead to a terrifying conclusion.The ways in which conflict grows between the generations is shown very effectively in this drama because, whilst it's natural for parents to want to protect their children from pain, exploitation or bad experiences, it's also entirely natural for teenagers to want to explore life in the way that their instincts dictate and not be given advice which they just regard as being interfering by parents who want to spoil their fun. The tensions in the Walker family are also complicated by the step-parents' desire to be accepted by their adopted children and also the uncertainty that children can feel about a parent's new spouse.Reese Witherspoon does a great job of portraying the mixture of naivety and growing maturity that's typical of a 16-year-old and Mark Wahlberg is particularly good in the scenes that require him to express his anger. William Petersen provides the other standout performance as the father who's left frazzled by being overworked, having to contend with his concerns about his daughter and trying to cope with his wife's unreasonable attitude to his work commitments. Overall, this is a movie which provides some pertinent observations on family life in the 1990s in a story that's perfectly paced and delivered in a style that's never dull.",Fear
39,TheUnknown837-1,"If you thought the ending to ""Fatal Attraction"" was ludicrous, wait until you get a load of this!",4,4 April 2012,"In 1996, James Foley directed a movie called ""Fear."" If there is any irony to be found in that title, it may very well be in that Mr. Foley would have had reason to be concerned about his career after making this mindless, overproduced piece of garbage. Five years earlier, now-famous Reese Witherspoon made her debut in a wonderful movie called ""The Man in the Moon."" In both that film and this one, she played a teenager troubled by her crush on a boy. Except in that much-superior film, it was because her crush was three years older than her and he was smitten by her sister. In this film, it's because he's a sex-addicted psychopath who won't leave her be.""Fear"" could be described as an adolescent version of ""Fatal Attraction."" But there is a difference. Up until its last ten minutes, ""Fatal Attraction"" was a splendid thriller as well as an insightful one. It had a sharp, shrewd knowledge about marital affairs. Hence why Glenn Close still claims to this day that her performance stopped several men from cheating on their wives. That movie did lose its mind in its big climactic ending, but ""Fear"" is a movie born without a mind. And if you thought the ending to ""Fatal Attraction"" was ludicrous, wait until you get a load of what happens here.One of the core faults of the picture is lack of a demanding villain. I've had mixed feelings about Mark Wahlberg before, but this could be his worst performance. As the stalking boyfriend with a household of hoods, he's about as frightening as the stone lions in front of a library. There are two sides to Mr. Wahlberg's performance, one worse than the other. When his character goes psychotic at the end, it's just limp ham-acting. But he's worse at the beginning, when he's pretending to be a nice guy just by speaking softly and hanging his eyelids as if he had insomnia. But I guess Mr. Wahlberg, who can act when given a worthy screenplay, cannot be fully blamed here. For I doubt this material could have been handled well by any actor, young or old. Because I was not the least bit intimidated or frightened by him, I saw no reason why Miss Witherspoon, or her parents or friends, would be, either.However, the worst sin the movie commits is insincerity. It is tackling a very topical and relevant collection of subject matter: underage sex, early-age affection, the tough times between parents and children at that crucial age of sixteen. But instead of offering insight about these tough times--that everyone of us can relate to in one way or another--it just pushes those opportunities aside in favor of over-the-top exploitation. Take, for example, the denouement of the picture. Instead of going for a plausible conclusion, the movie goes into a cheesy monster-on-the-loose formula, which very well have been a parody of ""Night of the Living Dead."" This is the sort of film where four teenage boys have been granted special powers like second lives and super-human strength. They apparently also become master electricians and know more about architecture than the designer of a maximum security system. How do they acquire this vast array of skills? By doing drugs, raping high school girls, and playing lots of pool. I don't buy it.The movie is so unconsciously bad that it is always racing ahead of itself. Even a scene such as a jogger running through some woods (not chased by a bad guy, by the way) is accompanied by whooshing camera motions and a soundtrack so noisy that it would make the world's most obnoxious rock band ask for a little quiet time. I suppose if there was any good intentions from the makers of the movie, it would have been along the lines of Larry Clark's ""Kids"" released a year before. But whereas that film had a purpose, ""Fear"" just pretends to have a purpose.",Fear
40,baumer,Do you remember what it was like to fall in love for the first time?,7,12 August 1999,"Warning: may contain some small spoilersIt's really funny, with better marketing this film may have done better business.  What I remember seeing about this film was how evil and maniacal David was going to be.  You knew going into the film that he was going to do some really bad things after his facade as the good boyfriend was over.  But really, the whole first half of this film has the same feeling as Pretty In Pink or Some Kind Of Wonderful.  When I was watching how Nicole ( Witherspoon )was quickly falling for David's charm and sweetness, I was intrigued.  There are some great moments in here that explore young love and my favourite scene in the film and one of my favourite scenes ever that deals with young virginal sexuality, is the roller coaster scene in the film.  Everything about it was pure and honest. David ( Wahlberg ) and Nicole get into the front seat of the roller coaster and she is wearing a very short skirt.  The ride begins and then the music starts.  The song is Wild Horses by a group that I am not familiar with ( no, it is not the Stones ) and they begin to move.  David begins to inch his hand cautiously up her skirt.  Her facial expressions are perfect.  She is apprehensive but excited and after a brief resistance, she lets him touch her.  The roller coaster ride becomes a metaphor for how she is feeling. Nicole has now just had her first sexual experience of any kind and David has her.  He knows it's only a matter of time before he will take her virginity and she knows it as well.  On this level, the film is perfect.  Exploring young love is a delicate situation but director Foley handles it with ease and he even shows the beauty of how love can make you feel.  It's just too bad that the film has to take a different path at the conclusion because this could have been a great coming of age love story.  I'm not saying the psycho elements to the film are terrible, I'm just saying that the innocence of the love story seems to work and fit better in here.  This is a film that reminds us of what it was like to fall in love for the first time and what it was like to make love the first time.  And I enjoyed it for that. 
I do recommend seeing this film but it just seems like two movies that could have been one.  But it is enjoyable and the actors in here are great.  Even Mylano and Petersen as Nicole's best friend and father respectively are fun to watch.  So it is a good film.  But again, not to be redundant, but I liked the innocence of it better than the vigor.",Fear
41,hall895,Trash,2,5 January 2007,"Well this is about as bad as movies get. Nothing to see here, move along. If you must know the threadbare plot follows 16-year old Nicole Walker, played by Reese Witherspoon. Sure is a long way from this garbage to an Academy Award for Miss Witherspoon. But I digress. Anyhow, young Nicole falls in love with seemingly sweet, nice, perfectly charming David McCall, played by Mark Wahlberg who somehow managed to salvage an acting career after appearing in this movie and thus was spared a lifetime of ""Whatever happened to that Marky Mark guy"" questions. Of course if David is as seemingly wonderful as he initially seems this movie would have a different title. As it is, David soon reveals himself to be a murderous lunatic and everybody does not in fact live happily ever after.So what's wrong with this movie you ask? In a nutshell, everything. The script is terrible, with some of the most god-awful dialogue ever heard. The characters are all clichéd, pulled straight out of so many similar and infinitely better movies that had come before. This film has nothing new to offer, it's just a painfully bad rehash. It's meant to be suspenseful and shocking. In fact it's just laughable. Nothing here is believable, the whole thing is over to the top to the point of stupidity. Don't even get me started on why Nicole's completely ordinary family lives in a home with more security features than Fort Knox. It's downright ludicrous, an artificial attempt to make the climax of the film more dramatic. Unfortunately by the film's climax you'll be stifling yawns.

If you ever are unlucky enough to have to sit through it you'll wish you could forget it too.",Fear
42,TOMASBBloodhound,Third act spoils it.,6,7 January 2007,"Fear appears to be a decent enough thriller; at least up through the first hour. We have a great cast who all play seemingly interesting characters, and that bodes well for the rest of the film. As the action plays out, however, things seem to jump the tracks of credibility. That's a shame since this could have been a really good little film.The story centers around a 16 yr old girl named Nicole (Witherspoon), who seems to have a lot going for her. Unfortunately, she like so many other young ladies, falls under the spell of a ""bad boy"" named David (Wahlberg). We the audience can tell from the start that David and his buddies are at the very least shady, and at the very worst homicidal maniacs. Nicole realizes this too after a while. But in defiance of her father (Petersen) she sticks with David a little too long. By the time she's ready to dump him, David is totally obsessed with Nicole, and will stop at nothing to be with her. By the film's final 15 minutes, David and his band of cronies have laid siege to Nicole's house and are terrorizing her entire family.The film starts out great. We the audience meet characters we care about, and things play out somewhat realistically. The cast is really awesome. Many of the principal performers would go on to much bigger things over the years. Witherspoon and Alyssa Milano are gorgeous, and Mark Wahlberg shows some talent in his first major film role. William Petersen is great in anything he does, and his performance here is no exception. The film falls apart in the final minutes, though. Characterization and logic are thrown out the window as the film relies too heavily on violence and mayhem to sort things out. There are a couple really ridiculous scenes toward the end. In one of them, Wahlberg snaps the neck of one of Witherspoon's friends while he's walking home from school. This is silly enough, but it's also poorly filmed and not at all convincing. In another scene, we see Wahlberg repeatedly punch himself in the chest to make it look like Petersen has beaten him up. It just looks stupid as he's pounding away at himself and trying to look tough.I don't know. Go ahead and try this one. It could have been better but it's not a total loss.6 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Fear

There are only a couple of deaths, including Kaiser but throughout the film the spectator is fearing death most of the time.For me the soundtrack was awful, unmemorable and in the nightclub shots the volume was too loud ! What is the human race coming to, if to derive pleasure from music, it is necessary to have it at such a loud volume ? This adds nothing to the film, just annoys me. The other thing is the girl, Nicole ......... God, she's dumb, won't listen to her father, jumps into bed too soon with a strange man, leaves condom packets lying around in the bedroom, and worse of all gives him the entrance code into her house despite her father having forbidden her to have visitors in the house.

It's therefore difficult to feel sorry for her once she gets herself into trouble.David has a seemingly affable and polite character at the beginning, but during his first visit to Nicole's house addresses her in a rather authoritarian way when asking for a drink and Nicole's dad picks up on this, but the big shock really comes when he sees Gary and Nicole together in front of the school and really ""lays in"" to Gary, the scene is EXTREMELY violent, actually worse than the scene where he breaks Gary's neck in the woods. Fom here onwards things gradually go down hill and even our dumb Nicole ends up by realizing that David isn't perhaps such a good bet after all.The final scenes where their house is attacked from outside by David accompanied by his local band of scum is reminiscent of Straw Dogs of 1971 and I'd bet the director had seen and appreciated that film as well as Misty by Clint Eastwood where the psychopathic Jessica Walters is precipitated by Eastwood out of the house and crashes to the rocks below, and in this film, David ends up laying across the rocks.I applaud above all Nicole's father in all this, he had sassed out the evil character of David from the start and he held firm right until the end, unlike his wavering girlfriend who appears to want to be tough on Nicole at the beginning and during the film becomes soft and permissive. Still, if all the characters were the same, the film would n't be interesting.The film, then is certainly to be recommended if you like to be made afraid by cinema but if, like me, you are not turned on by excessive blood and gore !",Fear
44,Movie-12,A typical James Foley picture. ** out of ****,4,20 August 1999,"FEAR (1996) **Starring: Reese Witherspoon, Mark Wahlberg, William L. Petersen, Amy Brenneman, Alyssa Milano Director: James Foley   97 minutes   Rated R (for violence, sexuality, language and drug use)By Blake French:	""Fear"" is a desperate, horror-free thriller. It does manage to generate some heavy suspense in the twenty minute finale, but that does not make the film worth seeing. It wastes the talents of the lovely Reese Witherspoon, William L. Petersen, and I suppose Mark Wahlberg too. I hesitate to state that Wahlberg's talents put to waste because I am not sure that, beyond an attractive body, he has any. And James Foley--what in the world, he is something else. After watching ""The Corrupter"" earlier this year, and now this piece of trash, not to mention his past flops, ""The Chamber,"" (1996) and ""Two Bits,"" (1995), I begin to wonder about his career in the future.
""Fear"" takes a spin on the old ""girlfriend and boyfriend--boyfriend is not whom he seems"" genre. The sub-title to this film is ""Together forever...or else,"" but most of the movie doesn't live up to that clever plot point. The teenage girl in the picture, Nicole Walker, is well played by Reese Witherspoon, but if I was in charge I'd have to say that Alicia Silverstone was born for the role. Although I hold nothing against Witherspoon. In fact, I think she should get recognition for her performance this year in ""Election."" I just think Silverstone has the punky, street girl type attitude more than Witherspoon.	Anyway, the teenage girl in the picture, Nicole Walker, is like all other teens her age, about sixteen. She has a father, Steve, who doesn't want his little girl to grow up, a mother who takes her side, and friends, Billy and Margo Masse who may or may not betray her before the film is over. She has a hard time getting a date usually, but when going out with her friends one night, seeing a muscular, seductive hunk playing pool named David, the next time they meet it is almost love at first sight.  	When he is introduced to Nicole's parents, who naturally live in a house guarded with high tech security systems and camera surveillance, along with a police officer watching over the mansion-like dorm, the vibes are at first too good to be true, then become quite bleak. After a few instances involving David and Nicole's friend Billy, Steve begins to suspect something more to David than meets the eye. And guess what? He's right. First he discovers that David has no family or apparent history, and then finds out his spent his childhood being shipped from orphanage to orphanage. After the emotional and physical battles begin Steve and David, and Nicole changes her mind about this hunk who she was quick to judge. David's obsession with Nicole leads to some extenuating--and even murderous--circumstances.
	There is some character chemistry between the David and Nicole characters, and the way their relationship is presented, their circumstances are surprisingly believable. The problem with the characters: instead of witnessing the development of the character's relationship, we get scene after scene of David and Nicole sensuously making out and starring into each others eyes, never actually letting us become involved. And the scenes, which are supposed to be steamy and hot, are strained and fake looking.	The film is so desperate for tension, which is not supplied by the script, it even features a scene where Walhberg 1) pounds his chest so hard it gives him bruises in order to frame Nicole's father, 2) creates a homemade tattoo on his chest that reads ""Nicole 4 ever,"" and 3) concludes with an ending without any motive that precedes in the script. None of these things have any dramatic purpose in the film. The scenes where David deforms his body only prove to us that he has an uncontrollable love for a girl that not hates him, but also we never feel anything in his young mind simply because of the lack of character development. So to make a long paragraph short, the film is all build up and hardly no payoff.	The filmmakers clearly desire to go for outright suspense and skip the terror. And under the circumstances, they do a pretty good job. The ending is kind of interesting, and Mark Walhberg does provide an evil eye to die for, too bad he can't get over his flamboyant self esteem--both in and out of character. There is even a disappointing false first act that tries to make us believe Nicole and David are over with. Give me a break. For once, why can't the girl be the psycho. Now that would be an original and engaging thriller.",Fear
45,moviesleuth2,Terrifying,10,14 June 2010,"This is not a perfect movie. There are some definite flaws, but they are either forgivable, or they come with the territory. That being said, this is one of the most frightening films I have ever seen.Nicole Walker (Reese Witherspoon) is a sixteen year old who after spending most of her life living with her mother, has moved to Canada to live with her father, Steve (William Peterson), his new wife Laura (Amy Brenneman) and Laura's son, Toby (Christopher Gray). While at a rave, she meets David McCall (Mark Wahlberg), a hot older guy with whom Nicole quickly becomes smitten. But as with every relationship, the smitten learn that even those who seem perfect have their flaws. Before long, Nicole is wishing she'd never met him.Part of the reason why this film works so well is that the script is brilliant. The dialogue and the characters are so real that the characters become real individuals instead of pawns to be terrorized by the nice guy-turned-psychopath. Even the character establishing moments, which most thrillers treat as obligatory, are just as engaging as the terrifying ending. It is genuinely refreshing to watch characters who are so real. This isn't an artistic screenplay, but credit must go to Christopher Crowe for creating dialogue that is so naturalThe other reason why this film works so well is because the actors populating it are wholly believable. I've never been a die-hard Reese Witherspoon fan. She's a good actress, but there's something off-putting about her, as if she's trying too hard to be natural. Not here. Playing the part with equal amounts independence and naiveté, Witherspoon is dynamite. Mark Wahlberg is terrific as David, playing the sweet guy and psycho equally well. In movies like this (like ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle""), the villains run the risk of becoming pawns of the script. Not here. David is a living, breathing human being, albeit a very twisted one. William Peterson has no problem essaying the part of a dad trying to raise a teenage daughter. Amy Brenneman is especially interesting as the ""new mom,"" whose attempts to get on the good side of her step-daughter may cloud her judgment.James Foley has created a near masterpiece of the genre. He lets everything unfold naturally, and aside from a few minor instances and one over-the-top scene, it's a perfect film. What occurs here isn't suspense, it's actual terror. It may be flawed, but I cannot let a movie that scared me this much go with anything less than a 10. This is a dark, brutal and scary film, and it will leave you shaken and exhausted by the end of it.",Fear

With this film I have one large element which really bothered me and hindered the film.It's too slow - by the bio you know that the character David (Mark Walhberg) gets dumped and he turns into a bit of a psycho. Well this happens about an hour into the film. We should have watched him develop his psycho traits but instead he just goes from 0 to 100 in about a minute. The beginning of the film just jumps essentially to the end because of this also.Not a lot really happens in the first hour, they get together, have fun, dad doesn't entirely trust him. Nothing out the ordinary. Then all of a sudden he's a total nut job, which leads to the final part. Felt like they stretched out the first 20 minutes into the hour. It just needed more of a character development on Mark Wahlberg and the build up to the final part.The end however was pretty good, tension was built up pretty well and you are left on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. So that's done well. Acting from a young Mark and Reese was good. But yeah that's about it. 6/10 from me.",Fear

It had good and bad parts to it. The Good: The actors were well chosen. Particularly Mark Wahlberg and William Petersen. Scenes were well set to make you feel a certain way. Happier scenes were more colorful and seemed brighter and more alive. More evil scenes were more gray and darker. The music score also helped quite a bit. David's history was also very interesting. Alyssa Milano did a very good job as well.The Bad: It seems Reese Witherspoon always had to try to be in the spotlight, thus her character, Nicole got to be annoying and after a while I was wishing she would just get killed off. Some scenes were off-timed, and the pacing in the movie was very bad. Over all, it is well worth a view. Interesting, dark and graphic, this movie is a good one for horror fans.6/10.",Fear

Two Thumbs Way Up!Although this story is fictional, it is the sad true reality of certain teen relationships,(both males and females as the victims) that go terribly wrong. The victim is naive and he or she falls into a trap set up by the abuser. The abuse then sometimes escalates to point where just like in this movie it can be extremely dangerous and possibly fatal.When Nicole's parents discovered the dangerous, awful, and deadly truth about David,(her new boyfriend), they demanded that she break-up with him. But Nicole would not do it. However, when she finally does listen after a string of incidents he keeps on stalking her and those around her.

57,vip-danii,A Solid Stalker Story,7,6 October 2016,"First of all, even though I'm not a huge fan, I thought Mark Wahlberg's performance was great in this. Reese Witherspoon... I'm not so sure. Her character was dull and uninteresting. I don't know whether the character was written this way or it was the actress's interpretation of it, but even though she was supposed to be the leading female, she felt more like a supporting character. Her character is so boring and average, you have no desire to root for her at all.Another major distraction: Wahlberg's character seemed totally out of place with the rest of his partners-in-crime. Not only they looked much older, they were far more intimidating, and totally a different ""breed"" if you see what I mean. The actor was trying his best, and he did generally give out the menacing psychopathic stalker vibe, but the character was unconvincing at times. For instance, there should've been some kind of a back story on him. A bad boy like that who's seen all kinds, just doesn't develop an obsession this intense with a random chick after one date.Despite the fact that the movie is far from realistic, it's still an entertaining watch and a solid stalker thriller.",Fear

As Wahlberg starts dating Witherspoon, she realizes too late that her new flame is a violent and weird psycho, killer and gang leader who soon becomes a real threat to the whole family... and it didn't last long until good and evil faces in an all destroying fight...The story is quite simple, but it really works. The direction is thrilling and fast-pacing, Carter Burwell's soundtrack is a menacing, gloomy score in the wake of Bernhard Herrmann, and the actors are really good, especially Petersen, Witherspoon and Mark Wahlberg who portraits a really disturbing character miles away from his former New Kids On The Block and Markie Mark pop star image.The songs featured in this film are also really great and a good selection of groovy mid-nineties dance and indie rock tunes. The end is really dramatic and a nice rip-off of ""Rio Bravo"", ""Assault on Precinct 13"" and ""Straw Dogs"".

The movie is a romance, drama, thriller and horror. The latter, I have no idea because this movie has nothing that deals with horror.The movie is about a sixteen year old girl named Nicole Walker (Reese Witherspoon) and her family. It starts off nice, the family seems normal and Nicole starts dating this guy by the name of David McCall (Mark Wahlberg).

Nicole's friends, Gary Rohmer (Todd Caldecott) and Margo Masse (Alyssa Milano) both know something isn't right with David.This film shows the fears of fathers as they see that their little girls are growing up and dating. It is true that something like this might happen, disregard the ending though. You really can't trust guys who just pop up in your house hold and start getting all friendly with your wife and daughter. The movie ends with David killing Gary, then he and a bunch of his pals go and try to destroy Nicole's fathers house and kidnap her. Luckily for Nicole, her father arrives just in time to kill David.

61,chucknorrisfacts,The only thing scary about this movie is Wahlberg's bad acting...,1,28 July 2011,"This movie is way too predictable to be able to be enjoyed. You can see everything coming a mile away. Isn't that the antithesis of what a suspense film should be? Shouldn't I be surprised when something happens? After all, isn't suspense just a feeling you get when you're not sure what's about to happen? If so, it would seem the word and the movie are a contradiction in terms.The acting is pretty stale as far as I'm concerned. Reese Witherspoon plays the pretty idiot. She doesn't really have that much to say in this movie, even though she's basically the main character. As far as Mark Wahlberg is concerned...Man, oh man, is he a terrible actor or what? I seriously don't see what other people like about him. I think this movie would've been better than it was had they been able to find a better actor to play Wahlberg's character. What was it I didn't like about Wahlberg's performance? Well, for starters...His ""good guy"" persona was way too transparent. You'd have to be a complete moron to not know this guy was a fake. The pickup lines he was feeding Reese were being put on so thick I about wanted to hurl...Why do girls buy this kind of crap? Meanwhile, his ""bad guy"" wasn't very intimidating as far as I'm concerned. If I would've been Reese's dad, I would've opened a can of a whoop-ass on Mr. Marky Mark here.Overall, this movie is a ""by the numbers"" suspense flick. Nothing new. No surprises. No suspense.

Counting on a cast of young, beautiful and talented actors, Foley accomplished a work that, if it is not exactly memorable and marking, guarantees with certainty some hours of entertainment. Nicole Walker (Witherspoon) is a studious and rich adolescent with relationship's problem with her father and stepmother, who meets in a club the mysterious David (Mark Wahlberg). She falls in love with the boy, who seems to be an enchanted prince of the modern times: he treats her with love and  demonstrates his fondness. However, David will be revealed himself as a dangerous and obsessive psychopath, who will kill all the obstacles that try to separate him from Nicole. The fast rhythm, underlined by a modern sound track,  help to consecrate ""Fear"" as a show recommended for adolescents. Courtship, school, problems with parents' relation, all this is treated in a slight,nice way by Foley's work, identifying the motion picture with the youths' problems. The director adds doses of violence and tension to the story (specially in the end, when Steve, Nicole's father, will do anything to save his family), but it doesn't get to shock or to innovate the gender, however, Foley follows the rule of suspense films and  makes a correct and entertaining work.

It felt natural and was purely a matter of style without overdoing it, which I really loved. That was also the only thing that left me questioning a bit: the direction completely changed after the opening to a conventional kind of directing.I think it would've been better if they had maintained the feel that we got during the opening scene, setting the tone for the movie, especially during the scenes that were a bit more tense and also in general over at the perp's place. The scenes at the girl's house could have been pushed on edge more by making the world a bit bleak.The fact that they broke with the grungy directing to me was especially noticeable with the chase later in the movie that cut back to the running in the opening of the film that had a very clear grungy feel to it. The fact that it didn't made the experience less intense, relatively disconnecting the experience from the theme. The whole grunge culture focuses on intensity, rawness, what you see is what you get, a straight up kind of attitude. That was now missing even though it would've made the movie excellent instead of good if they had dared to dig into that.When I saw the trailer, I was afraid it would be a made for TV movie and it in no way turned into anything like that due to a great screenplay, great cast, acting, and the directing was largely great also, but someone wasn't feeling it.

In one scene in particular he beat's Nicole's male friend up when, upon arriving to pick Nicole up from school, sees him hugging her. That's when Nicole realizes that David is not who she thought he was. After that, she can't decide if she should continue seeing David or not.Her father (played by William Petersen-of C.S.I.) already knows that he doesn't want his daughter to continue seeing David and he makes this known to him. I thought this scene was well done, though a bit cliché, as David basically turned it all around on Mr. Walker. Then David beats on his own chest to cause it to bruise and then tells Nicole that the bruises were caused by her father. This pretty much starts an all out feud between Mr. Walker and David. The final straw for David and the crew he rolls with is when Mr. Walker goes to their residence and ransacks the place.Eventually, it all comes to to a satisfying ending as Nicole, her father, brother, mother and her friend Margo Masse (played by Alyssa Milano) are trapped in the Walker house by David and his posse of thugs. I especially liked the ending cause, well, cause I did.Acting wise, I thought Reese Witherspoon was believable in her role as a young, naive teenager who was looking for acceptance by someone. Mark Wahlberg, although in some scenes I was laughing at his acting, actually comes off quite well as a charming, albeit psychotic, man who will do anything he has to do to have the ""one"" he wants, even if that means killing her family so they can't get in the way of that from happening. And William Petersen does his job accordingly as the father that will do anything it takes to make sure his baby girl is safe.The movie has a good look that creates a nice atmosphere for the feel of the movie. I love the songs in the movie, especially by BUSH. The song 'Wild Horses' by Sunday Girls (I'm not 100% positive on that) is used rather, in my opinion ""amusingly"", in a scene that features Nicole and David on a roller coaster. In this scene David...well, watch it for yourself if you really want to know.All and all, there are worse ways you could pass an hour and a half. FEAR is no classic but it knows what it wants to do from the get go and, for the most part, succeeds at doing so.",Fear

77,TheTwistedLiver,breakthrough performances for Witherspoon and Wahlberg,7,17 October 2007,"This movie came out when I was in High School and I remember it being a decent thriller/action film. After reviewing it over ten years later, it stands up fairly well to the test of time. This film is more important as it was the first lead role by Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon as well as a big role for Alyssa Milano. When I saw this film in the theaters Mark Wahlberg was known primarily as the model dude for underwear and a rapper, I distinctly recall this performance as proof the guy had talent as an actor. Of course he went on to become primarily an actor and has come into his own as a leading man. Overall the film moves along nicely and is entertaining, a few parts are cheesy but worth seeing if you are in the mood to be entertained.",Fear
78,Camelot_2000,A '90s Version Of Fatal Attraction,4,6 December 2020,"That pretty well sums it up about this ""rich-girl-meets-handsome-hoodlum"" suspense thriller. It all follows the usual steps of an innocent teenage girl falling into the attraction of a questionable beefcake who manages to charm her friends and family except, of course, for her father.Mark Wahlberg radiates a perfect ""wolf-in-sheep's-clothing"" performance as the mysterious hunk who strongly displays sincerity and love towards Reese Witherspoon's Nicole. Considering that this was one of his earliest acting jobs at the beginning of his movie star career, he clearly showed he had what it takes to chew up the scenery. Most notably when he starts acting unhinged and obsessed halfway through the film.This is by far though just an average romance/ psycho thriller with the usual formula of a remote wooded home under siege by a ruthless bloodthirsty gang. That's what it pretty well boils down to after Nicole finds out what a sickening heel the man of her dreams turns out to be.This is indeed an entertaining and erotic thriller with plenty of suspense to spare, but as far as quality goes, it's just basically average fare and doesn't really offer too many major surprises. It just builds itself up into a helpless scenario, but turns to easy solutions for the conflict the victims are raging against the villains.Mark Wahlberg is indeed an Adonis in this and Reese Witherspoon is beautiful as the lovesick heroine, but two gorgeous people aren't enough to elevate this psychotic chiller into higher quality work. It delivers on edge-of-your-seat excitement, but only to a certain extent. It does nothing to rank this higher than other fatal attraction types of flicks where romance turns into a bloodthirsty gore-fest after someone gets jilted and wants sweet revenge. This could have been better.",Fear

Fear is A surprisingly Dark Psychological thriller. With moments of sex and violence that were more graphic than what i was expecting. The cast showed early signs of the talents and stars they would become, Alyssa Milano for me giving the best performance in her small role in the movie. I enjoyed the father - daughter relationship which seemed realistic. The Direction of the film was on point and the action in the film keeps things moving along at a steady pace, and the tension building towards a reasonably satisfying climax.negatively, i did not enjoy the soundtrack, as individual songs i may have enjoyed them, but they did not build tension and seemed to not match the action taking place, moments in the story came off as silly especially a sexual assault confusingly being seen as a legitimate consensual sex act.

But I'm not ashamed to say that I really enjoyed watching this movie. To be sure, there were the typical cliches (did anyone not know that the security guard was SO dead!). However, the action in the film keeps things moving along at a steady pace, and the tension builds towards the reasonably satisfying climax. Performances by the lead characters were generally quite good. I found Mark Wahlbergs character to be quite convincing and quite menacing, though I agree he would certainly benefit from some speech coaching. The two young female leads, Reese Witherspoon and Alyssa Milano, did a good job playing the victims, and certainly add value to the film for their attractiveness alone. The standout performance for me was that of William L. Petersen as the father. Most of his actions/reactions rang true to me. Was ""Fear"" a great movie? Not really. Was it a good, satisfying and ultimately entertaining way to spend 97 minutes? Yes indeed. Even my wife stayed awake till the end, and that's worth an 8/10 alone.",Fear

88,Doctor_Mongoose,The only thing I feared was I might fall asleep,4,24 September 2009,"Fear? Oh dear, I really don't know where to start with this awfully dull ""thriller"". I managed to sit through all of it but for a fairly short film it dragged on and on for what seemed like an eternity and the only thing that I was really fearful of was that I might fall asleep with the TV on and waste money on my parents' electricity bill.With a thriller you are supposed to build up tension throughout the film and then release it all in a nail biting climax that leaves you gasping for breath and on the edge of your seat. It's a fairly simple idea, but Fear manages to botch it up royally.You are introduced to a fairly tedious rich family, apparently facing all sorts of problems, and then after about quarter of an hour of mindless bitching the daughter meets supposedly the perfect boyfriend. As the guy says himself ""if something seems too good to be true it probably isn't"", meaning that he is obviously going to be a psycho. So much time is spent on them being ""loving"" together it doesn't really add anything to the plot except for making you want to throw up. One particular scene on a roller-coaster was particularly distasteful and quite disturbing for entirely the wrong reasons.The premise isn't actually that bad, they probably could have squeezed a decent movie out of it if they had really tried but they decide to ignore subtly and hit you in the face with the obvious. They could have let the boyfriend slowly display his psychotic side, flashing the audience hints that the girl doesn't notice, so our fear for her grows the more and more the relationship goes on. The more she doesn't know he's bloody mental and the more we do, the more we care. Instead they decide that he is going to display his mentalness right in front of her face by going ape-**** and attacking one of her buddies, all because the poor dude gave her a hug.After this the plot just gets more ludicrous and keeps going round in circles but somehow manages to get to a really promising climax. Just when I thought the film might just be able to redeem itself, the director manages to mess up the ending as well. Brilliant.There isn't really coherent message to the film and the acting from everybody is well below par. The entire film plays out as an endurance contest for how many clichés you can handle before you are forced to turn the TV off.",Fear

I also missed the cooking oil. The lady of the house was cooking away when Mark and his mates turned up, maybe the new fat free diet fad, so nothing to irritate the psychos? Who knows. I thought it was going elsewhere for a while and was very sad when it all became too predictable.

Director James Foley (who has shown his potential with Glengarry Glen Ross but has made some VERY bad business decisions) made a good effort however, but couldn't come up with the goods. He created some genuine tension in the film's climax and some steamy scenes between Wahlberg and Witherspoon but I guess with an appaling, extremely derivitive script, unconvincing performances -especially by Wahlberg who looks right but just dosen't have the edge- and bad casting (Witherspoon/Peterson) one can only do so much. One way this failure could have been a success was to tone down the violent/scary tone and let Wahlberg reveal his psychosis slowly (Jaws anyone?) instead of revealing it before we can even say RIPOFF!.",Fear

97,narmelan_tharmalingam,FEAR: Mark Wahlberg as Villian,6,24 August 2020,"Fear is a thriller 1996 film from a time when plots relied on teenage spirit more than technology. Mark Wahlberg early on skillfully blends the menacing personalities of his character well with his predatory interest in co-star Reese Witherspoon, whom also displays earlier work here. David played by Mark, is cool lowkey dude love one second and over-controlling psycho the other. If you are a fan of his latter works, usually in the role of an all American kick ass action hero, this film showcases range. The film is supported with some comedic relief when we are critical of some intense scenes, but this is a result of time occurring rather than terrible acting.
Nonetheless, if you enjoy the look of the 90s grain on screen and want a thriller without takeaway morals, this is recommended. It is worth the butter on your popcorn.",Fear

What started out looking not too bad because of Reese Witherspoon turned a little ridiculous and predictable after a while.Nicole (Witherspoon) is a 16 year old girl who feels she is overly sheltered by her father. When she goes to a party with her friend Margo (Alyssa Milano), she meets David (Mark Wahlburg), who seems rough around the edges but turns out to be really sweet . . .she thinks. When he starts to become a little demanding of Nicole, her father begins to worry, especially when he finds out the two have had sex. Then David beats up a guy friend of Nicole's for hugging her, and she decides to break it off. But its not as easy as it seems, with David's manipulative ways edging towards more serious violence.The movie started out fine, but I grew a little tired of Nicole's overly trusting nature with David and began yelling at the screen. The end succeeded in scaring me a bit, but it was expected. Not much surprised me in what happened, except when Nicole's dad finds David's shrine of her. That was creepy as heck. But while the movie is in no way perfect, it provides a few creepy and violent moments. Mark does a good job in being a weird psycho stalker, and Reese gives Nicole the emotional edge the character needs, through the relationship with the father.Overall, not a total waste of time, but a movie you should rent before buying.",Fear

There is a romance aspect, but its not too mushy.Excellent acting from both Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon. Both so young in this film, and also still acting today. I could easily say that Fear features possibly one of the best performances from the pair of them. Wahlberg's ability to play a psychopath so easily, and convincingly is amazing. Witherspoon's naivety as a sixteen year old girl, was also incredibly outstanding.

There was potential for more.",6,24 February 2019,"The movie is predictable in it's plot, but unique enough in it's execution (until it's final scene) that you want to keep watching. This combination makes it a movie you can watch more than once without losing interest.The cast was great, although Reese Witherspoon does over act her emotions on occasion, and Mark Whalburg slips in and out of his accent. Alyssa Malano isn't bad either, although she brings nothing new to a typically scripted character.There was ample opportunity to give this movie more depth and originality, but it seems the writers went for a familiar story line without giving it the time and thought it deserves. The biggest plot misses for me were;
1. Nobody has a cell phone. Although at the time the movie was made (1996) cell phones weren't what they are today, given that they have been available most people since the 1980's it doesn't make sense that a businessman like Steven, who seems to work around the clock, wouldn't have one
2. When Nicole is looking in through the window and catches David and Margot about to have sex, it is very clear that it is against Margot's will.In fact, it is a very unsafe situation she is in, yet Nicole leaves, only making the decision not to be with David anymore. She doesn't try stop it from happening, or get her friend help, or check on her after. I lost respect for the character after this, as essentially what she witnessed was her best friend's rape, yet she couldn't see past her own hurt feelings. It would have been a more powerful ""break up scene"" had she helped Margot and confronted David.
3. Later in the movie, Nicole confronts Margot about what happened with David, and Margot says she was forced into it (which Nicole saw first hand). Rather than Nicole not being able to see or be there for her friend because of her own trauma, or being angry at Margot for not warning her about the type of man David was, she was actually upset about the fact that Margot had sex with David at all. In fact, she reacted as though this was an affair Margot had happily participated in, and not the sexual assault that it was. I was disappointed at the approach the writers took, and felt more sympathy for Margot than Nicole, feeling Nicole was the bad friend in that scenario. Again, I felt It would have been a more powerful storyline to have this shared bad experience with David strengthen the girls' bond - especially given Margot's presence in Nicole's house anyway for the final scene.
4. On a similar note, as Margot was with David's friend and presumably at the house regularly (enough to be comfortably having sex with the friend in a crowded living room), surely she would have witnessed the dark side of David that Nicole clearly knew nothing about?
5. During the final scene, Laura tells Steven the house cannot be broken into and he should know this as he designed it himself. She then lists the numerous reinforcements he put in place to secure it. Given how much thought he obviously put into the security of the house, and that he does this for a living, why would he overlook something as simple as a security gate at the bottom of the stairs? On the off chance intruders get in, the family can hide safely upstairs and at the very least buy themselves some time.
6. In the same regard, why not have an emergency back up telephone line - or a handheld transceiver perhaps - to the guard house? Or a safe with a gun?
7. After what David did to the car, and the fear over Nicole's safety, and Steven trashing David's house knowing there would be retaliation, why didn't Nicole at least carry pepper spray with her? And why wasn't the security guard informed of the situation, given they had even informed the school?
8. Margot arrives and shortly after the house is attacked. Didn't she see them following her? And if they arrived before her and hid, why not barge in when the door was opened to let her in?
9. Gary is beaten to death in the woods near after school. By that same evening Margot is at Nicole's house to inform her of his murder. It seems implausible that this would be enough time for his body to be discovered and the crime scene investigated enough for Margot to know that not only has he died, but how he was murdered. The movie doesn't depict any close relationship between them that the family would call her, and if they did call why not call Nicole, his best friend, first? And they couldn't have heard from the school, as it happened after school hours.Although these are my burning questions, I was able to look past them and enioy the movie nonetheless. I've actually watched it more than once and would happily watch it again. I would recommend it to anyone who can enjoy a movie that is what it is, pure entertainment without trying to be anything more.",Fear

What is it about Reece Witherspoon that the screen makes her look like candy.  She is sweet.  Marky Mark's (Mark W.) pre boogy nights performance is pretty good.  I can see why the producers and directors of his future bad mistakes gave him a chance.  He should have stuck to more gritty roles like this one and that of Boogie Nights.  Alisa Milano sure did grow up nicely.  I can recommend this movie to anyone who likes a pretty predictable thriller.",Fear

Steve Walker: The big deal, Laura, is that the guy gives me the creeps, and the girl is my daughter"". He sees haw David charmed his wife,Laura,the stepmother of Nicole and her little stepbrother,Toby.He is becoming more possessive when he discover a condom wrapper beside Nicole's bed.Steve wants to keep David away from his family.After a while Nicole breaks the relationship with David when he beats her male friend,Garry.Not long and David regains Nicole's trust and we could see that love is blind and powerful especially first love.Nicole looses her virginity with David.He thinks now that Nicole is fully his and wants it to be forever.The tagline is very good:""Together forever. Or else.""I was really mad when David rapped Nicole's best friend,Margo,after being with Nicole. Nicole comes to David's ""home"" and saw how Margo was carried by David.She didn't realized that Margo was going against her will.Nicole again breaks up with her love and in this moment David looses it.He kills Garry,trashes Steve's car,is stalking Nicole and even sexually assaulted her in a public bathroom.Steve returns the favor,trashing David and his gang's place. They will come to the Walkers home for revenge.This is a very good moment in the movie.One of David's friend wants to touch Nicole and David comes and kills him with could blood,with a bullet in the head .Again we see that in an obsessive way he loves Nicole.I disagree with the end of the movie,because David dies.I wanted him to survive the fall,to get therapy and Nicole to sit by his side.If that happened,the end of the movie wouldn't have been predictable,but neither letting us wanting more :)If you want to see a good psychological thriller,with very good actors and scenes,see ""Fear"".",Fear
119,mrbuttershki,Mark Wahlberg Somehow Stole The Show.,10,8 September 2005,"I brought this up because although it seems obvious that Mark Wahlberg was the most interesting character, I am a man that finds Alyssa Milano and Reese Witherspoon hot as an erupting volcano. I actually rented the movie just to stare at them. But what I got in return was perhaps Mark Wahlberg's best performance of his career in a realistic thriller whose genre is often overrun with violence. So kudos to Wahlberg for taking over this film with Milano and Witherspoon involved in it. But what was especially interesting was how slowly Wahlberg's character showed his dark side. It wasn't just all of a sudden, like in most other films involving psychotic people. It also teaches today's virgins to be careful of who they hook up with. I could have actually cared less about the other characters, simply put, Marky Mark stole the show. An underrated thriller.",Fear
120,switchback,disturbing behavior,10,13 October 2001,"Jeez, people - just because the film is called FEAR, it doesnt mean that it automatically has to be a horror! Anyway, this is an excellent film, and for more than one reason. First of all, Marky Mark (yes, i know now he's Mark Wahlberg but as far as i'm concerned he's always gonna be Marky Mark - such a silly name deserves not to be forgotten) is a great baddie - i hated him from the first scene, cause even though in the beginning he's kinda nice, you could see in his eyes that he's about to explode.  Rest of the cast is also greatand Foley's direction is superb. Next thing i liked was the father - daughter relationship cause it dealt with rather unpleasant matter - father realizing his little girl is not so little anymore and she's having sex (just ask any dad - it's a nightmare) cause that's something you don't expect to see in an american film, at least not done as good as in this movie (I heard somewhere that before his film career Foley was a psychiatrist so i'm not surprised with that) And of course, there's excellent soundtrack (Bush rocks!). As far as I'm concerned, this is a very disturbing film, i give it 9 out of 10. If only Jerry Goldsmith did the score it would've been a pure 10. WATCH THIS FILM!!!",Fear

Mark Wahlberg did a fairly good job as the insane, obsessed, jealous boyfriend. He was totally scary in this movie. One of the things that really got on my nerves was the whole killing off the dog and Gary. I happened to think Gary was a good character even though we don't see a whole lot of him. On the other hand Mark Walhberg's character had to kill off someone. I also liked Alyssa Millano's performance as well even though at one point in the movie I almost hated her for hurting her best friend, it ended up not her fault in the first place.

123,ALL4God3590,one of the scariest movies i've ever seen,7,29 May 2005,"I saw this movie on the USA channel, so I know it was edited a little bit. I only watched the movie because I saw it had Reese Witherspoon in it, since she's one of my favorite actresses. I ended up enjoying it, but the plot was a little far-fetched. The movie starts out with Nichole seeing a cute yet mysterious David at some local hangout. She later meets him at a party and they leave together and take a walk. They decide they want to date and he goes home to meet her parents. At this point you want to like David but a few minutes later when Nichole's dad tells him that Nichole's curfew is midnight, David sets the clock back 30 minutes. You know then that he has a dark side. Then Nichole's parents go out of town and Nichole and David do uh, bad stuff. You can already tell that David is obsessive, and that something is wrong with him. When Nichole's dad finds out about what his daughter did when he was out of town he immediately turns against David, and tries to get them to break up. Then David beats up Nichole's friend Gary when he is seen innocently hugging her. That is the turning point at which everyone realizes that David isn't just possessive, he's physco. The story goes on as Nichole breaks up with David, and he and his criminal friends kill Gary (and Nichole's dog-which is a disgusting scene), and try to break into Nichole's house. The ending is fairly predictable, but I still somewhat enjoyed this movie.",Fear

Alyssa Milano shows why she is one of the hottest chicks around. Mark Wahlberg rocks. This movie has everything a movie should have. Drama, Action, Comedy, Romance. This movie is an excellent snap shot of defining life in the 1990's much in the same spirit those 1980 montage movies did a decade past. What I mean by that is if you are trying to explain what the spirit 1980s were like in movie form, one might say well take a look at Better of Dead, or Preaty in Pink, Sixteen candles, and Real Genius etc. You want to describe clothing styles, slang/vocabulary, the feel and and attitude of the 1990s you get that in this movie Fear. The music all though not in the soundtrack from the Group Bush is awesome and again captures what the 1990s were all about. This movie is highly underrated.

And it's not surprising that Margo was sleeping with David too, yes he probably did force her to, but she probably would have anyway... she's such a slut. And I agree with Nicole's step-mom. Nicole is a slut too. Maybe if she wasn't David wouldn't have been so attracted to her. I was so sad when the dog died. I don't know how he died though. I left the room 'cause it's so obvious that they're gonna kill the dog. They were calling it behind the rock and ""HELLOOOOOO!"" you can't be so stupid as to think that all they're going to do is pet it. I loved the part where Nicole's dad throws David out the window.

131,pamplemouseall,"Great acting, could have used a more postmodern outcome",7,21 October 2007,"Lots of great performances, silly 90's outfits, (the skirts are ridiculous)and a good, metaphorical climax. However, in the spirit of the world not entirely rotating around the perspectives of middle aged white men, (however wonderfully portrayed) the resolution to the bad boyfriend problem should not come courtesy of one's other dominant male family member. I'm not saying the fear of the bad boyfriend isn't present in the fathers of such daughters, but perhaps an able bodied young woman could have done a little more for herself than sit in her room screaming when the psycho came to call. Inadvertently this suggests that the way out of this all too common problem is to wait for another male to come and rescue you. Somehow I think that the same story where a young man is the primary target would hardly result in a showdown between his middle aged mother and a crazy ex-girlfriend. Post-modernism critique aside, Wahlburg is FABULOUS. Having him start out so wonderfully charming absolves Witherspoon's character of any blame. This movie would be really interesting to see rewritten.",Fear

He kisses and touches her so sweetly that you really sometimes wish it was a love story and that there are men out there that can make a girl feel that happy. I loved the roller coaster scene because the song went so well with the whole scene it makes you feel for that one scene maybe David and Nicole will make it. The movie left me feeling something for days and i don't know what it was at all but I think it was the song and that one scene.",Fear
133,domains-10,There's a real life serial rapist named David Wayne McCall (strangely),10,1 June 2008,"I thought this movie was an excellent and very realistic production! Not only is it realistic, but it reaches into the mind of the psycho, which I thoroughly enjoyed.This David McCall character strangely resembles a real life counterpart: David Wayne McCall.There's a real life convicted serial rapist named David W. McCall, who was convicted as a juvenile in South Bend/Notre Dame, IN Indiana, in St. Joseph County: David Wayne McCall was convicted at age 15 for serially and violently raping several St. Mary's College Students in the late 1970's. McCall is accused of multiple additional rape cases in Plano, Dallas, & Irving Texas, and is still suspected of a rape / murder case in Indiana where he allegedly murdered CAROLYN SCHINKE. I knew him back in school at Clay Middle School and Clay High School where he was an award winning wrestler (trained by coach Glen Nelson: Great Job Coach!) and he always seemed extremely violent. He was caught in Texas and convicted of several crimes: he is now serving a life sentence! You can get more info at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice website, 168.51.178.33 his TDCJ # is 00876980 This is definitely one psycho I'm glad isn't out raping & killing anymore!

134,djill,well worth watching once,7,15 October 2008,"If you've watched this movie, chances are you'll either love it or hate it. If you hate it, you'll hate it for its predictable plot, simplistic storytelling and obvious catering to hormone-driven teen girls looking for some eye candy in the shape of young Mark Wahlberg's visually pleasing physique. But if you love it, you'll love the convincing and multi-faceted acting. You'll love its honest take on first loves and first experiences, and you'll love it for Mark Wahlberg's visually pleasing physique. Because let's admit it: The boy's darn fine.FEAR offers everything you expect from a '90s psycho stalker thriller directed at a young audience. It does, however, go further than that. Unlike most movies of this genre, FEAR manages to make you, let's not use the word sympathize, but at least understand the crazed lunatic and, if nothing else, respect that David's need to 'own' the girl is not based on an entirely unfounded and ridiculous madness. The stalker guy for once isn't one-dimensional and the movie takes the time to lead up to the climax and show us a believable relationship between the bad guy and the victim.The climax of the film, on the other hand, is a little bit disappointing. The grand 'showdown' was necessary to the plot, but doesn't seem very well thought through. I feel that involving David's lowlife cronies was a bad choice  they were nothing but distracting extras. Having David 'storm the gates' alone, or some other scenario involving only David, Nicole and her father, would have been much more logical and effective.All in all I give FEAR 7/10 stars. It is not a work of cinematic genius, but it is a gripping, well acted and entertaining movie and worth watching at least once.",Fear

Being a residential counselor and seeing men behave this way - it is completely realistic. The psychological background completes Mark Wahlberg's character development. The upbringing and dialog corresponds to the promiscuous friend's behavior Played by Alyssa Milano. This is the most under-rated movie. Mark Wahlberg shines in this one.There is one particular scene in this movie that is still stuck in my head which rarely happens. The few lines from Mark Wahlberg are so poetically psychotic it leaves you thinking for hours (or even days) after the credits role - which is what a movie is supposed to do.
