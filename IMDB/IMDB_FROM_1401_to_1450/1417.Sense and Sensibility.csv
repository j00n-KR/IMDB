0,TheLittleSongbird,"Great book, beautiful film!",9,22 April 2009,"I love Jane Austen, and I love period dramas. This film, while a little too long, was perfect for me. I loved it when I first saw it a year ago, and I still love it now. Sense and Sensibility is a great book by Miss Austen, and this film does the book justice, in my personal opinion. The film looks gorgeous, the camera-work, the locations and the costumes. The script sparkled with wit, subtlety, romance and heartache, especially when Marianne goes out into the rain and gets herself ill. The music is lovely also. The performances were exceptional. Period-film veteran Emma Thompson is lovely here as Elinor Dashwood, and Kate Winslet matches her perfectly in a beautifully-blended portrayal of the tragic Marianne. As for the men, they were very good too. Hugh Grant was exceedingly charming as the male lead, and I have read many reviews criticising Alan Rickman's acting.(not on IMDb though) He may have been older than Miss Austen intended, he was very good also as Colonel Brandon, but not as good as the other three. His style of acting is very suave and charismatic, like Sean Connery and George Sanders. If you've seen him in Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves you'll know what I mean. All in all, a lovely film, maybe not the best period drama, but has plenty of elements that makes it truly memorable. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Sense and Sensibility
1,Leofwine_draca,Shame about the ladies,6,14 September 2021,"I'm a huge, huge fan of the BBC version of PRIDE & PREDUJICE which I consider the definite filmed version of Austen's work. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is pretty good by comparison but suffers from Winslet and Thompson, who are simply too overbearing for me to find this that lovable. The good news is that the production values are splendid and the rest of the cast is fine, particularly Rickman.",Sense and Sensibility
2,SnoopyStyle,terrific acting from great cast,8,11 March 2015,"John Dashwood (James Fleet) is left his father's entire fortune as required by law. The female heirs, his stepmother, half-sisters Marianne Dashwood (Kate Winslet), Elinor Dashwood (Emma Thompson) and Margaret Dashwood are given only £500 per year. John promises his father to take care of them but his greedy wife Fanny convinces him to give them nothing. Fanny's brother Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant) visits and becomes close to Elinor. Fanny keeps them apart and the women move into kindly cousin Sir John Middleton's cottage. Mrs. Jennings is intent on being a matchmaker. Middleton's military buddy Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman) falls immediately for Marianne but she is looking for literary epic passion. That's when she is rescued by the dashing John Willoughby (Greg Wise). Only Willoughby has secrets. Mr. and Mrs. Palmer (Hugh Laurie, Imelda Staunton) visit with poor Lucy Steele (Imogen Stubbs) who reveals that she's secretly engaged to Edward for the past 5 years.This is a cast of terrific actors led by Winslet and Thompson. The great thing that Ang Lee does here in this movie is to let them act. His unobtrusive style is perfect in giving these actresses space to do their work. The other co-starts are also great. Hugh Grant is adorably dorky and Alan Rickman is very compelling. Greg Wise is not the most charming guy in the cast and that is the movie's only handicap. Willoughby is suppose to be this dashing charming character above Brandon. Wise doesn't have that level of presence. Thompson and Winslet are so amazing that the movie can overcome any minor deficit.",Sense and Sensibility
3,kosmasp,Period drama,8,6 April 2007,"I haven't read the book (yet), but concerning the film as it is, I can assure you that it is very well made. You'll get one of the best period dramas (I wouldn't go all the way with ""best ever"", but then again, I don't often use extremes to describe a movies) that you have seen! Of course you have to be open to this kind of movie. Meaning, that if you're more likely to watch Bruce Willis in Die Hard or can't wait for the next Steven Seagal movie, this might not be your cup of tea! There is a strong possibility that you won't like (to watch) this movie at all.So if you have seen period dramas and like them, than watch this one too, if you haven't watched one yet, than this can be a perfect movie to start with (although some might say, it's downhills after that ;o) )",Sense and Sensibility
4,classicsoncall,"""Love is not love, which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove.""",8,29 May 2018,"I'm not big on period films but this one held my attention well enough. I've seen Emma Thompson recently in a couple of Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearean adaptations, and have come to appreciate her talent in a way I haven't noticed before. The actor I couldn't quite endear myself to in this story was Hugh Grant. He seemed to have such a wimpy demeanor that it turned me off to his character. Not his fault probably, because director Ang Lee is calling the shots. Lee continually surprises me with films so disparate in which he's the guiding hand. How do you figure ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Hulk"" and ""Life of Pi"" were all directed by the same man who did the honors for this film? I'm at a loss to explain it.The other surprise for me in this picture was the presence of Alan Rickman. I've always associated him with more or less villain type roles, and it was interesting here to see him portray a compassionate sort of character. Even so, I can't come to grips with the chemistry that eventually brought Colonel Brandon and Kate Winslet's Marianne together. Nor for that matter, did Elinor (Thompson) seem like an obvious match for Edward Ferrars (Grant). But the story itself was told well, with kudos to Ms.Thompson for adapting Jane Austen's novel into a competent screenplay. It was almost like watching Shakespeare.",Sense and Sensibility
5,gavin6942,Ang Lee Does Jane Austen,7,23 March 2015,"Rich Mr. Dashwood (Tom Wilinson) dies, leaving his second wife and her three daughters poor by the rules of inheritance. The two eldest daughters are the titular opposites.I never really got into Jane Austen, and I do not believe I ever read ""Sense and Sensibility"". I had no idea it referred to two characters how they differed. Knowing that now, it makes me appreciate the title all that much more: it is like saying ""Reason and Emotion"" but with a much more alliterative sound. Heck, more than alliterative.How this got in the hands of Ang Lee is unknown to me, but I am glad it did. This is an adaptation that makes what could have been a dry, stuffy Victorian tale seem very much alive. And the excellent casting. Emma Thompson, who also wrote the script, is excellent, and the supporting cast: Kate Winslet, High Grant, and all the greats.",Sense and Sensibility
6,lee_eisenberg,Why Hulk's director make boring movie about rich English people?,5,28 December 2005,"Several years before Ang Lee make Hulk movie, he make ""Sense and Sensibility"". It show rich British women wondering who they marry. That make Hulk bored! England have class system, and this movie not show that! Hulk have to suspend reality to watch it. Charles Dickens always show class system, but Jane Austen never do that. Hulk know that his own movie kind of silly, but in a way, his own movie more intellectual than ""Sense and Sensibility"" (Bruce Banner not want to turn into Hulk, but he like feeling of power).Hulk want to talk about cast members. Kate Winslet great actress. Hulk see ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Finding Neverland"", and like her better in those movies than in ""Titanic"". When her next movie come out?! Hulk want to see it! Hulk not like Hugh Grant. Hugh Grant playboy, and his antics distract media from important issues in world. Hulk never see ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", hear mixed things about it. But Hulk see ""Nine Months"" and think that Robin Williams' character only good one in movie.Hulk think that Alan Rickman great actor. Hulk like him in Harry Potter movies, and glad that he come out against invasion of Iraq. Maybe if he get bigger role in this movie, movie come out better. Why Alan Rickman not get bigger role?! In conclusion, Hulk not think highly of ""Sense and Sensibility"". Hulk never read novel, but movie go nowhere. It not awful movie, but it not amount to much. Ang Lee do better with ""The Joy Luck Club"", ""The Ice Storm"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Hulk"". Hulk hear he have new movie coming out soon and Hulk want to see it.",Sense and Sensibility
7,jboothmillard,Sense and Sensibility,5,19 September 2005,"Based on the popular book by Jane Austen, with the Oscar winning screenplay by Emma Thompson, and directed by BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Brokeback Mountain) made it sound pretty good. It is a good film, but to be honest, I only wanted to see it for the amount of good British actors and actresses appearing in it. It is mainly a story of class or something with some marriages, a death, and obviously a load of the best of British talents ever. Starring BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated (for actress) Emma Thompson as Elinor Dashwood, the gorgeous BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Kate Winslet as Marianne Dashwood, BAFTA nominated Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, Hugh Grant as Edward Ferrars, Greg Wise as John Willoughby, Bridget Jones' Gemma Jones as Mrs. Dashwood, Imogen Stubbs as Lucy Steele, BAFTA nominated Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings, Tom Wilkinson as Mr. Dashwood, The Vicar of Dibley's James Fleet as John Dashwood, Imelda Staunton as Charlotte Palmer, Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer and Sugar Rush's Richard Lumsden as Robert Ferrars. I couldn't exactly understand the entire story, in fact, I don't think I finished the film. But what I do remember and understand was pretty good. It was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Music for Patrick Doyle and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Film, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Adapted Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. It was number 70 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Worth watching!",Sense and Sensibility
8,ccthemovieman-1,Emma Can Break Your Heart,9,17 February 2006,"Wow, here's an emotional story that gets you involved and wears you out by the end. I wears you out not from action, but from watching two good ladies suffer heartbreaks one after the other. This is not my normal viewing fare but I am big fan of two things this movie has to offer: (1) Emma Thompson and (2) incredible visuals.Few people were better in the 1990s at playing the sensible-sweet-wholesome and pretty and-always unfairly ignored woman than Thompson (see The Remains Of The Day and Howards End). Your heart aches for this woman whose characters always deserve better than what they receive.. Her facial expressions alone convey pain better than anyone I've ever seen on film. This is perhaps her best work and it was justice she was honored for it. It was refreshing to see Alan Rickman actually place a nice guy and Kate Winslet was appealing, too - a far cry from spoiled brat role in the film that gave her stardom, Titantic.One tip that I found useful in watching this movie. If you are not British, you might switch on the English subtitles to better understand the dialog and the phraseology of early 19th century England, in which this story takes place.The only problem with using the subtitles is that it detracts from marveling at these visuals. This is one of the prettiest films I have ever seen, on both the inside and outside scenes. It's just gorgeous cinematography frame after frame with beautiful colors. Nice music score, too.This kind of story is a bit too soap opera-like for my normal tastes but to watch Thompson and to ogle the colors, sets and scenery makes it all a rewarding experience. For women who like these kind of Jane Austen stories, this must really be a special film. For the rest of us, it's still very much worth seeing, and adding to one's DVD collection. It''s great film-making.",Sense and Sensibility
9,rmax304823,When WILL the Right Man Commit?,7,30 July 2009,"Old Mr. Dashwood dies and leaves almost his entire estate to his son and his wife, according to custom, while his three daughters -- Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, and little Emilie Francois -- are left virtually penniless. The problem then is to get the elder sister, the self-contained Thompson, and the younger sister, the rambunctious and impulsive Winslet, married off to the proper men. The romance must be a concordance between the prerogatives of the heart and the prerequisites of the purse. Meanwhile the daughters are invited to live for a time in a remote cottage. ""A cottage -- how cozy,"" sneers the sister-in-law who now has possession of the mansion. That declasse cottage, by the way, is about the size of your house multiplied by a factor of four. The rest of the movie is a working out of a more or less happy ending.The first potential mate to enter the picture is mother-dominated Hugh Jackman. He and the reserved Thompson pretty quickly bond. They seem to love one another although the word is never spoken, this being a very decorous society here. At one point, in an over-directed scene, Jackman seems about to propose. He's awkward, shy, and he hems and haws his way through an adumbration of the revelation he's about to make. We think, we hope. As he stumbles along, Thompson listens in a way that can only be described as avid. Her eyes widen, her mouth opens, she seems to dance slowly on her heels, tensing all over as if pushing against a stuck door. Just as Jackman is about to say whatever it is he's about to say, a messenger runs in and Jackman is called away for most of the rest of the movie.Potential mate number two -- Alan Rickman. I'd only seen him as the slimy villain in ""Die Hard"" and was surprised at how appealing he made his less-than-prepossessing character here. When he first spies Winslet the younger, his appearance lights up, his eyes sparkle, his Darwinian points quiver. But he's soft-spoken and slow. He follows Winslet around like a dog but she is far more interested in -- Suitor number three, the witty, dashing, gamboling, handsome, capricious, young Greg Wise, who has memorized Winslet's favorite Shakespeare sonnet. He seems to court her. He whispers to her in public. He clips off a lock of her curly blond hair. He takes Winslet aside and says, ""There is something of importance I would like to ask you."" But he is whisked away by a more immediate demand on his attention -- the second instance of proposal interruptus. Then he deserts her and marries a rich woman without a word of explanation.The film, based on Emma Thompson's own screenplay, in its own quiet way, is a little like an afternoon domestic drama, with intrigues, secrets, unspoken love, an illegitimate pregnancy here and there -- but it has majestic landscapes and lavish wardrobes as well, and the acting by everyone involved, down to the smallest bit, is superior. What a job it must be to make Austen's dialog come alive. Winslet: ""But surely you must stay!"" Rickman: ""No, I must away."" But the performers get the job done, and more.It's always nice when the demands of the heart are met, and this is a convincing portrayal of a patriarchal society, but I wonder if the impulses these two sisters (and their female friends) feel is limited to their particular circumstances. I'm thinking of David Buss's book, ""The Evolution of Desire."" Here's a quote from it. ""Women across all continents, all political systems (including socialism and communism), all racial groups, all religious groups, and all systems of mating (from intense polygyny to presumptive monogamy) place more value than men on good financial prospects."" That's not misogyny, it's a fact of human nature. A woman is born with all the eggs she will ever have. Any pregnancy represents an enormous investment of energy, time, and devotion. If a species is to survive, the woman and child must be in the most secure circumstances. In our society that means money and power.I kind of enjoyed it, except for the sappy, soapy double-wedding climactic scene with a heavenly choir and wedding bells on the sound track. For me, the most important moment came not with the wedding but with Emma Thompson's suddenly breaking into a torrent of sobs when she discovers that Jackman has returned to finish that proposal he began in the stable. She'd been accurately described as ""resigned and accepting."" The breakdown is cathartic.",Sense and Sensibility
10,preppy-3,A little long but VERY good!,8,7 July 2011,"Based on a novel by Jane Austen. The movie deals with two sisters--sensible Elinor Dashwood (Emma Thompson) and carefree Marianne (Kate Winslet). Elinor falls for nice Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant) but his family feels she's beneath them. Old but kind Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman) falls for Marianne but she falls for young dashing John Willoughloy (Greg Wise). Many complications occur.The movie is too long (over 2 hours) and sometimes TOO quiet but I was truly never bored and loved it--with reservations. It was nominated for 7 Academy Awards and won for Best Screenplay for Emma Thompson (well deserved). It looks beautiful, is well-directed by Ang Lee and has a beautiful music score. Almost all the acting is top notch--except for two people. Grant is WAY too mannered in his role...but he's not in the picture much. Same with Thompson. She's not horrible but she's ALWAYS quiet and controlled. Just once I wanted to see her break loose--but I guess Austen heroines aren't allowed to do that. Also Rickman was cast against type as a loving man--and pulled it off beautifully. If you don't like costume dramas stay far away from this but everybody else should love it. A must for romantics. I give it an 8.",Sense and Sensibility
11,evanston_dad,Did I Accidentally Change the Channel to PBS?,7,8 May 2009,"Solid if uninspired adaptation of the Jane Austen novel.There's absolutely nothing wrong with this film, but it's all a bit dull, a Masterpiece Theatre version of the story that would be as at home on PBS as on a big movie screen. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet play the two sisters, one with sense and the other with sensibility, while Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman play the love interests. There's some nice footage of the English countryside, and it all goes down ever so pleasantly, but you're forgiven if you find yourself nodding off now and then.Directed by (of all people) Ang Lee.Grade: B",Sense and Sensibility
12,HotToastyRag,The best Austen movie ever,10,13 June 2019,"It's remarkable that Sense and Sensibility is one of my favorite movies when I can't stand one of the leads and wish it ended differently. However, since everything else in the movie is positively wonderful, I can't help but love it and often reserve it as a special treat enjoyed on my birthday.In my favorite Jane Austen story, three sisters and their widowed mother are turned out of their home when the patriarch dies and is legally forced to leave everything to his son from his first marriage. Poor and with no dowry, the girls struggle along love's rocky road amidst a society that matches people within their financial levels. If you've ever read a Jane Austen novel, you know it takes all your concentration to weed through her wordiness and see the bigger picture. Emma Thompson won a well-deserved Oscar for writing the screenplay and adding wonderful tidbits that weren't in the novel but make the characters more intense and lifelike. Combined with Ang Lee's thoughtful directing, the scenes flow with perfect pace. It was a slower time, but when women are shown sipping tea or embroidering, it's part of their way of life, not the focus of the entire scene and therefore boring the audience. There's a very natural feeling to the film as if we're eavesdropping, and the sound is crisp and clear even as it realistically bounces off high walls, or grows softer as the camera moves further away from the actors. There's a wonderful scene when the main family arrives at their new, much smaller house for the first time. Emma Thompson and Gemma Jones walk leisurely up the hill with Elizabeth Spriggs, but Kate Winslet races up to the house and explores its rooms. The camera follows Kate, but if you listen very closely, or watch the movie many times, you can hear every word of the other group's conversation, which includes important dialogue.Equal to the impeccable filmmaking is the acting. Emma Thompson is a fantastic emotional heroine forced to hide her emotions from others, but thankfully, not the camera. Since she was the screenwriter, her performance could have felt over rehearsed, but every scene is fresh and vibrant. Her thoughts and feelings are so full and clear, she communicates with the camera even when her back is turned. Alan Rickman easily commands the audience's attention from his first scene. Very often he's shown in the background of someone else's closeup, and he's always contributing to his character, making your heart ache for him even more. It's so wonderful to see him in a romantic role, and if this is your first movie of his, as was the case with me, you'll find it impossible to believe he made a career playing villains.Kate Winslet plays the young romantic lead and the object of Alan's undying devotion, but hers is the only performance in the film that makes me cringe. Fans of hers will probably find her cute and endearing, but the only compliment I can give her is that she acted very young as her character needed to do. She was only twenty at the time, and for that, I do cut her a lot of slack. Kate's love interest, Greg Wise, may seem to be just a pretty face, but during your second and subsequent viewings, you'll notice the different layers he puts into his performance. Hugh Grant is Emma's love interest, and he's sufficiently bumbling yet charming enough to make the audience understand why she carries a torch for him. Emilie Francois is the youngest daughter, and she's so beautiful and full of spunk, you can't help but wish she had more screen time. The matriarch, Gemma Jones, is delightful as she shows where her younger daughters copied their silly, flirtatious behavior. Elizabeth Spriggs is fantastic. She's warm, hilarious, loyal, kind, and careful. She's simultaneously someone you wish you knew and someone you really believe lived in the 1800s. Harriet Walter, Imelda Staunton, Hugh Laurie, James Fleet, Robert Hardy, Imogen Stubbs, and Tom Wilkinson don't have much screen time, but they make the most of their roles and cause such impressions that wherever you seen them next, you'll probably say to yourself, ""That's the guy/girl from Sense and Sensibility!""Full of quotable lines, like ""Fondant!"" ""Does she care for olives?"" and ""The air is full of spices,"" beautiful cinematography, memorable moments, and classic romantic scenes that are often shown in film montages, it's easy to make this version of Sense and Sensibility a favorite.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Kate Winslet leaves the dance, the camera is in her POV for a few seconds and it will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",Sense and Sensibility
13,Wuchakk,Costume drama/romance in early 19th century England with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet,7,13 November 2017,"RELEASED IN 1995/96 and directed by Ang Lee, ""Sense and Sensibility"" chronicles events in England circa 1810 after Mr. Dashwood dies and legally leaves his estate to the son by his initial wife, which leaves his second wife and their three daughters relatively destitute. This negatively affects the marriageability of both practical Elinor (Emma Thompson) and romantic Marianne (Kate Winslet). When Elinor falls for the handsome Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant) his kin object and put the kibosh on their blossoming relationship. Meanwhile, the noble but aging Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman) becomes infatuated with young Marianne, but she is interested in the dashing John Willoughby (Greg Wise). Imogen Stubbs plays the rival for Edward's interest.If you're in the mood for period piece drama/romance ""Sense and Sensibility"" fills the bill pretty well. It starts great, gets a tad tedious in the middle, but perks up at the end. The English locations/sets and costuming are superlative. You might want to take advantage of the subtitles to make out all the verbiage and keep track of all the names in the slightly convoluted relationship-oriented plot. In any case, it's interesting seeing Winslet before her big success with ""Titanic"" (1997) and Rickman playing a straight role rather than hamming-it-up as a goofy villain.THE MOVIE RUNS 136 minutes and was shot entirely in England (Devon, Norfolk, London, Wiltshire, Somerset and Cornwall, with studio work done in Shepperton).

14,JamesHitchcock,"A Work of Harmonious, Balanced Beauty",8,12 March 2008,"It is strange to think that until the mid-nineties Jane Austen was almost completely ignored by the cinema. There was the well-known Laurence Olivier/Greer Garson version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" from the early forties, and then nothing. Over the next fifty-five years there were plenty of television adaptations of her works, but no cinematic ones. And then, suddenly, in 1995 three came along in one year. There was ""Clueless"", which transferred the plot of ""Emma"" to a modern American high school. There was ""Persuasion"", originally made as a TV movie in Britain but which elsewhere in the world was shown in cinemas. And then there was Ang Lee's ""Sense and Sensibility"". Or perhaps I should say Emma Thompson's ""Sense and Sensibility""- she wrote the screenplay and had been trying for several years to get it made into a film.The film tells the story of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Although their father is a wealthy landowner, they and their mother are left in straitened financial circumstances when he dies and the bulk of his fortune is left to John, their half-brother from his first marriage. As one might expect with Jane Austen, the film tells the story of their romantic attachments. Elinor is in love with Edward Ferrars, the brother of John's wife Fanny, but he has long been secretly engaged to another. Marianne has two admirers, the handsome and dashing John Willoughby and the older Colonel Christopher Brandon.The two sisters, the ""Sense"" and ""Sensibility"" of Austen's title, are very different in character. Elinor (""Sense"") is calm and practical, guided by a sense of honour, duty and responsibility. Marianne (""Sensibility""- a word which had a stronger meaning in the early 19th century than it does today) is passionate and impulsive, guided by her feelings and her imagination. In the book they were close in age, but in the film Elinor is considerably older- indeed, Emma Thompson is sixteen years older than Kate Winslet. Thompson, in fact, originally thought that she was too old to play the part of Elinor, but was persuaded to accept by Ang Lee. Although some have criticised Lee for casting a thirty-six year-old actress in the part, I felt that the casting works well dramatically. It might have been difficult for an audience to accept that a girl of nineteen (Elinor's age in the book) could have been quite so sensible and level-headed. Elinor and Marianne can be seen as symbolising respectively Classicism and Romanticism, the two dominant trends in early nineteenth century European culture. Classicism stood for the primacy of reason, Romanticism for that of the imagination. In the clash of these two forces, Austen's sympathies were definitely on the side of the Classicists- she is one of the few great Classicist writers of English prose fiction, and tried to exemplify in her work the Classical ideals of harmony, balance and restraint. Elinor tries to live up to those ideals in her life, normally successfully, which increases the contrast and dramatic effectiveness of the scene near the end where she breaks down in tears. Marianne, on the other hand, is a typical Romantic who believes in passion and freedom from restraint.Inevitably, it is Marianne who ends up being disappointed; few who are familiar with Austen will be surprised when the dashing Willoughby proves to be a heartless cad. As often occurs with her male characters, his surface charm hides a lack of decent qualities- the same is true of George Wickham in ""Pride and Prejudice"" or Henry Crawford in ""Mansfield Park""- whereas those who are less superficially attractive, such as Brandon, Mr Darcy or Edmund Bertram, turn out to be of greater moral worth. My one complaint about Joe Wright's otherwise excellent ""Pride and Prejudice"" is the inappropriately Byronic way in which Darcy was portrayed by Matthew McFadyen.The main theme of Austen's novel- the contrast between reason and the imagination- was well understood by all who participated in this film, by Emma Thompson (both as scriptwriter and as actress), by Kate Winslet and by Ang Lee, who has tried to emulate the Classical ideals which inspired Austen. (Although not English, or even European, by birth, Lee appears to have a fine understanding of English culture). Another film director who in recent years has drawn inspiration from the clash of Classicism and Romanticism is the former Python Terry Gilliam, in films such as ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" and ""The Brothers Grimm"", although Gilliam's sympathies are firmly with the Romantics. ""Sense and Sensibility"", however, is a Classical film; assisted by Patrick Doyle's neo-Mozartian score and some wonderful photography of the Classical buildings he used as the setting for his film, Lee has succeeded in producing a work of harmonious, balanced beauty. Together with Wright's film, this is the best of the recent Austen adaptations. 8/10",Sense and Sensibility
15,Smells_Like_Cheese,"A true story of family, friends, sisterhood, heartbreak, and love",10,4 October 2005,"I found ""Sense and Sensibilty"" to be one of the most charming movies I have seen since ""Finding Neverland"". It has a very warm feeling and is very welcoming. The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990's, all of Jane Austen's huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were very good, but Sense and Sensibility really stood out and was the best. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay, which was also her first. Kudos to her, she seems like a fine and intelligent woman. I found out that this screenplay took her about 4 years to have the final draft done. She also couldn't translate some of the novel into the book so she took some of Austen's letters and put them into the movie.The acting is absolutely on key and all of the actors fit quite well into their roles. I enjoy period pieces thourelly, if you don't, you might want to skip it. But I would recommend this picture any day. It's very beautiful and a wonderful movie to watch. It has some of the finest British actors: Allen Rickman, Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, and Hugh Grant. So give it a chance, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.10/10",Sense and Sensibility
16,sddavis63,Stereotypically Victorian,5,27 September 2009,"Let me state right off the top that this is a very pleasant movie to watch; a piece of 19th century romantic escapism based on the novel of the same name by Jane Austen that features solid acting on the part of the entire cast and that portrays an entirely convincing picture of pastoral life in the English countryside of the era. Focussing on the Dashwood sisters - Marianne (Kate Winslett) and Elinor (Emma Thompson) - the movie deals with the various potential romances that arise in their lives. The movie is solidly rooted in Victorian stereotypes - it's subdued, the characters are somewhat reserved or possibly even emotionally repressed (except perhaps for Marianne, who generally provides what emotion and colour there is in the movie.) For a movie that deals extensively with romance, love is never too openly expressed. In many respects, this struck me as a perfect vehicle for Hugh Grant, who generally comes across very well playing these subdued, soft-spoken, sort of shy romantic roles, and who therefore seemed perfectly cast as Elinor's love interest Edward. The movie is often mildly humorous as it portrays love's ups and downs, but I wouldn't call any of it downright funny, and there are some powerful scenes (again, featuring Winslet) dealing with Marianne being betrayed by her love interest.I'll confess that this movie isn't really my cup of tea, so to speak. There's nothing wrong with it. It's well-acted, well-written and generally well put together. Personally, and only because it's not really to my taste, I'd give it a 5/10 but if you really like these types of subdued romances or are a fan of Jane Austen (and I understand the movie is fairly faithful to the novel) then you'll rate it much more highly than that.",Sense and Sensibility
17,llltdesq,"Excellent period piece, well adapted and with a witty script and fine performances.",9,15 August 2003,"This is a remarkable film that does a very good job of depicting a rigid and quite hidebound society that often made India's caste system look reasonable and moderate by comparison.  One of the more enjoyable points for me was the fact that the ""sense and sensibility"" of the title had a most definite 19th Century feel and yet still remains very timeless and does not attempt to force Twentieth Century mores (probably by use of a crowbar) into a script where they do not belong.  Modern day viewpoints do not belong here.  If you want a modern day version, fine.  But it would be, at best, only a glancing and quite loose adaptation of the novel, so why do an adaptation at all, then?  Not all films have to reflect present day sensibilities.  This is a very human and compelling story with a fine cast and wonderfully witty script.  Look for a very dry and understated performance by Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer, the long-suffering husband of the daughter of Mrs. Jennings. Were I Mr. Palmer, I'd have long since invested in earplugs or opened a vein.  Very fine film and most highly recommended.",Sense and Sensibility
18,ElMaruecan82,"In the Name of Love, Marriage and Conveniences...",8,4 March 2017,"If it wasn't for Jane Austen's novels and their screen-adaptation, we wouldn't be much familiar with the English gallantry and the bourgeois manners of the early 19th century. Her oeuvre encapsulated a time where women didn't have a way to go through life without landing on the ""marriage"" square, hardly an issue to please feminists but who would call Austen traditional or submissive for all that? She respected the conventions but made powerful social commentaries in the indirect sense that her female protagonists never married someone they didn't love. Marriage was the end, but love was the means to achieve it, while marriage of convenience was the privilege of the mediocre ones.Now, there is an interesting point of comparison between her two most celebrated novels: ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"". ""Sense"" was Austen's first success, written at a very young age, yet it deals with characters evolving in the realm of adulthood, while in ""Pride"", written by an older Austen, the heroines are the Bennett Sisters who aren't older than twenty. It is just like Austen was a painter who had to go to the top of the mountain to have a clear view on a plain after having painted the mountain from the plain. With enough experience and wisdom, she was able to make a brighter portrait of a young generation who get the man through their actions. In ""Sense"", the Dashwood sisters are fully-dimensional characters, Elinor (Emma Thompson) is reserved and introverted while Marianne (Kate Winslet) is romantic and flamboyant, they're more mature than the Bennetts sisters, but at the expense of their reactivity.In ""Pride"", luck and men's valiance were not elements to count on, and many round trips allowed the heroine to confront her suitor. It is possible that ""Pride"" was a bit too modern while ""Sense"" was more obedient to the perception of women's role at the time (rather static), but the directing by Ang Lee and the screenplay worked in such a way that the quest for marriage isn't actually the most interesting part of the film. And while I don't think I give away the ending by saying that each one will find the true love, it's obviously not the point of suspense; the real question is how these people interact. And just like your typical Austen's stories, there's a good deal of passions and deception, or romantic studs popping up at the right moment and forcing the women to all align in the house to promptly welcome their host. Some are dark and brooding (Alan Rickman) other shy and amiable (Hugh Grant) and a few too perfect to be true (Greg Wise) but they all have one thing in common, they're conveniently called to office in London whenever marriage seems too close, a snobby bitch or karma playing the same game postponing the overdue rendezvous with destiny.But as predictable as these films are, their quality is elsewhere, starting with the acting. Literary movies have this quality that the abundance of words and plots can sometimes distract from simpler moments that actually elevate them more than any monologue or speech. This moment occurs when Edward (Grant), is ready to confess something to Elinor. They have spent enough time together to grow a deep feeling. He's about to say something about his you expect the word ""feeling"", he says ""education"", and you can see something click in the blink of an eye in Thompson's face, 'devastation' as it would really show in a woman who learned to hide her feelings. There's no doubt that Emma Thompson is one of the greatest actress of her generation. On the other hand, Marianne will also face abandon and the reaction will fit her passionate personality. While, the plot in itself can be summed up by women waiting for the right men to come, so (God forbid), they don't end up as bitter spinster, there is more to enjoy, the text and more importantly, the subtext.And on that level, Jane Austen's stories are exhilarating hymns for eloquence and literacy, whether when the characters write intimate correspondences, share their personal thoughts with their friends or relatives or try to convey a strong message by still respecting the conveniences, I just can't resist by the way Shakespeare's language is being honored. You finish the film and you just want to express your feelings with the same economy of obviousness or flamed passion when called for, and a similar urge generally invade me when I finish the Ivory and Merchant movies. There is something just irresistible in these British heritage films, they make you realize how close we still are to these times by the scale of history, but light-years ahead as far as mediocrity and plainness is concerned.And it's a credit to Austen's writing and Thompsons's rewriting (earning her an Oscar) to have translated the story in a tone that wouldn't make feminists' neck hair stand up and wouldn't portray men as misogynistic pigs.The film says something important: the strength of your character doesn't depend on what he or she accomplishes but how it can strongly affect your own feeling or how can they resist the cruelties of life without necessarily triumphing over them. All through the film, I was totally rooting for Marianne, Elinor, their mother (Gemma Jones) and the way they endorsed or rebelled against conventions at crucial times where simpler things were complicatedly expressed. Indeed, everything that happened is due to something said, a promise or a misunderstanding. It's all in the way words are used, misused or distorted and that's one of the many delights in this lavish movie.",Sense and Sensibility
19,g-bodyl,Feels Like The 19th Century!,9,19 March 2015,"Sense and Sensibility is a remarkable period piece movie and it explores the themes of love and poverty and the connection between the two. During the nineteenth century, marriage laws very vastly different and more complicated than they are in modern times. Just because you love someone, does not mean you can marry them, as this movie makes perfectly clear. Nonetheless, this movie is a epic, sweeping romance story and it is an impressive feat, because I am not a fan of these kind of romance stories. Luckily for this film, it is far from boring and I felt for all of the main characters. Ang Lee's film is about a family whose fortunes suddenly disappeared after the death of the wealthy father/husband. Now penniless, the family is forced to find a new home. The two eldest daughters find love interests, but are conflicted because of no finances or dowries in order to provide for marriage. The acting is one of the strongest suits about the movie. Everyone does a marvelous job and made me feel for each character, whether in positive or negative terms. Emma Thompson, whom also written the movie, does a wonderful job as the logical eldest daughter, Elinor. Kate Winslet does a fine job as the second eldest daughter, the romantic Marianne. I liked Hugh Grant's dashing character, the awkward Edward. Finally, Alan Rickman does a good job as another love interest, Colonel Brandon. Overall, Sense and Sensibility is a fantastic movie and that is no surprise with Ang Lee at the helm. The film is never boring and you can feel for the characters as they desire for true love, which is nearly impossible due to nineteenth century strict laws. The themes from the classic Jane Austen movie are still here, and it gives the movie a complete feeling and scope of this time period. The costume design and the cinematography are fantastic as well. All-in-all, a fantastic period-piece romance. My Grade: A-",Sense and Sensibility
20,ericstevenson,Remember Jane Austen?,9,9 October 2016,"It's great that an author as beloved as Jane Austen has had such a great movie made in her honor. I was confused as to why there wasn't an old version of this done in the black and white days. That was done with ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Pride And Prejudice"". I'd have to say my favorite adaptations of them all is the 1943 Jane Eyre with Orson Welles. Anyway, it was weird to just see such an authentic movie. Nowadays, we're so used to films that are nothing but action or humor, but this is quite different. It makes me feel bad that it's been so long since I've read an actual novel. I think my latest one was ""War And Peace"". Yep, read the whole thing! I really did feel like I was reading a book while watching this movie. Alan Rickman is the most well known person here, but it should be acknowledged that every actor and actress works hard. The dialogue is what makes this so good. My favorite part might be near the beginning where they're talking about love and money. They really do discuss how you need to be aware of your finances. That's mostly where the title comes from. Sense is like logic here and sensibility is like emotion. It has a victorious ending too. It wasn't intentionally made as a period piece, but it's still a great story no matter when you set it. ***1/2",Sense and Sensibility
21,secondtake,Doesn't Do Austen Justice,7,18 June 2009,"Sense and Sensibility (1995)A year ago I began this review: How could you take such talent, and such a story, and make is to ordinary? And there is truth to that, but I've just watched it again, and the quietness now sometimes strikes me as poise, and as social reserve. I mean, the filming is still merely functional--the camera-work is stale and the sense of lighting and blocking dead. The acting, however, tends to be first rate, with a surprising tenderness from Hugh Grant, and strong if a hair predictable portrayals of Austen's young women by Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson. But the plot is too often laid out, the scenes and ""action"" edited, and the atmosphere emphasized for the pauses between words rather than the words. As a Jane Austen fan, I protest. Austen is snappy and funny. It has less wailing of tears and more wry humor. I have to blame Ang Lee as director on this one, but it doesn't help that Michael Coulter's cinematography is routine, almost ugly stuff--and he got an Oscar nomination, too, go figure. For two comparables off the top of my head--the camera-work (and light) in the 2003 period romance, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" is not overly flashy but it's far more rich and involving, and beautiful. And do people think Jane Austen needs always to ""feel"" old and stuffy? Not so. Check out the way Austen is put on screen in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" the 2005 version with Keira Knightly. That is Austen brought to life.This refined ""Sense and Sensibility,"" though not miserable at all (I was crying at the end) is simply not half of what it could have been.",Sense and Sensibility
22,inkblot11,"Sensational, that's what Sense and Sensibility is, in every way possible",10,4 January 2007,"Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Marianne (Kate Winslet) are the daughters of the second marriage of their father, in early nineteenth century England. When he dies, guess who gets most of the money? That's right, the son of the first marriage. These two beautiful young women are left without substantial dowries and must move to a small but snug cottage with their kind mother and their younger sister Margaret. Elinor is a sensible sort who makes good decisions while Marianne is a talented musician with a capricious nature. As luck would have it, a handsome, rich neighbor (Alan Rickman) takes a shine to Marianne, but as he is a bit older than she, she has no interest. Elinor makes the acquaintance of Edward (Hugh Grant), the brother of her insufferable sister in law, and likes what she sees but knows she has little chance to make a match with him. All of a sudden, Marianne is caught out in the rain with a twisted ankle, and the handsome man who rescues her, takes her heart, too. But, is he interested in her, as her prospects for money are dim? Will fate deal kindly with these two lovely, intelligent females? This extremely lovely movie, to begin, is based on Jane Austen's first novel and the story and dialogue are, therefore, beyond measure. Emma Thompson's screenplay is to be highly commended, as she has kept Austen intact and the story made to nicely fit the span of two hours. Next, the actors in this film could not be better, not only the four stars mentioned previously, but all of the secondary actors as well. Ang Lee's direction is stunning, as is the cinematography, the costumes, and the settings. The final scene, where coins are tossed in the air at a wedding, is one of the most beautiful ever recorded on film. If you care about what you watch on film, you will not miss this movie. Instead, you will sensibly rush off at the earliest possible moment and secure the video at the store or the library. After a viewing of this film, you will feel an immense satisfaction and happiness that comes only a few times at the cinema and, in fact, in life. Enjoy.",Sense and Sensibility
23,atlasmb,An Understated Masterpiece,10,22 January 2016,"As someone who has never read the novel, I went into this film with no expectations. What I got was a brilliant adaptation.The Oscar-winning script was written by Emma Thompson. The direction is Ang Lee's first of an English film. This romantic story is full of sensitivity and the propriety of its time, when relationships were more about purity than passion.We learn that the estate of Mr. Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) is going to his oldest son--by his first wife--John (James Fleet). On his deathbed, the father extracts from the son a promise to take care of his current wife and three daughters. But John's wife, Fanny (Harriet Walker)--who is a self-centered social climber and passive-aggressive--talks him into nearly abandoning his promise.The three daughters are Elinor (scriptwriter Emma Thompson), Marianne (Kate Winslet) and Margaret (Emelie Francois). Elinor is the oldest sister--practical and experienced. The middle daughter, Marianne, defies conventions and believes that love and passion should be the stuff of marriage (""To love is to burn""). Youngest daughter, Margaret, likes to climb trees and hide under tables.After they move from their home to a small cottage on a relative's estate, they meet three men who change their lives. Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant)is a quiet , private man who hates cities. Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman) is an older man haunted by memories of a squandered love. And John Willoughby (Greg Wise) is a dashing figure of a man, whose tastes run to poetry and wildflower picking.Class distinctions and money factor into every decision in this world. It's a world lovingly rendered in ""Sense and Sensibility""--with beautiful countryside manors of rich interiors and fashions that are both chaste and revealing, in accordance with the era.The last minutes of the film offer some wonderful moments, attributable to the story and the acting. Kate Winslet, after her role in ""Heavenly Creatures"" is particularly noteworthy. All three of the men give nuanced performances. The entire film is a cinematic symphony with not one false note.",Sense and Sensibility
24,didi-5,Emma Thompson's fine Austen movie,8,30 January 2005,"Rightfully winning an Oscar for this adapted screenplay, Emma Thompson also stars as Elinor Dashwood, the eldest of a family of impoverished daughters left without funds when their father dies. The estate goes to the son of the first marriage (James Fleet) and his spoilt, selfish wife (Harriet Walter) and so the Dashwoods must survive as best they can.As we all know, that is far from easy in Jane Austen's world of riches, balls, and beaux. Elinor is initially courted by the wimpish Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant, in a stock silly-ass role); while her flighty young sister Marianne (Kate Winslet) is swept off her feet by the dashing John Willoughby (Greg Wise, who later married Thompson in real life). The youngest daughter Margaret (the talented Emilie François) likes to meddle and play games. Their mother is played with an air of resignation by Gemma Jones.'Sense and Sensibility', directed by Ang Lee, is true to the spirit of the book, with a touch of mischievous romance here and there. Rounding out an impressive cast are Alan Rickman, Robert Hardy, and Imogen Stubbs, and they add plenty to the talent already on view. The settings are impeccable and the whole film is hugely enjoyable. The novel itself may not be as much fun as 'Emma' but this is a fine film and one which should appeal to at least a large cross-section of the female audience.",Sense and Sensibility
25,Red-125,The best-known film version of Sense and Sensibility,10,10 June 2016,"Sense and Sensibility (1995) was directed by Ang Lee. It's based on the novel by Jane Austen, with screenplay by Emma Thompson. It stars Emma Thompson as Elinor Dashwood, Kate Winslet as Marianne Dashwood, Hugh Grant as Edward Ferrars, and Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon.Many people reading this review will be familiar with the Austen novel. It's a work of genius, and is as popular now as when it was written more than 200 years ago. The novel (and film) emphasizes the unhappy status of upper-class women in early 19th Century England. Gentlewomen had very few choices because they couldn't work outside the home, which meant that they were dependent on their husband for all things.Such is the case of the Dashwood sisters. By law, their father had to leave his home and fortune to his son by his first marriage. His widow and daughters received virtually nothing. They may have wanted to marry for love, but they had to marry someone who was able to support them. Sadly, everything pivoted around making a ""good"" marriage.Elinor Dashwood represented ""sense,"" that is practicality. Marianne Dashwood represented ""sensibility."" Clearly, the meaning of this word has drifted after 200 years. For us, ""sensibility"" implies ""sense."" However, for Jane Austen, the work had a meaning closer to ""sensitivity."" The sister with sense is pragmatic, the sister with sensibility is romantic and impractical.Kate Winslet is charming as the sister with sensibility. Emma Thompson is a great actor, but I believe she is miscast. She looks more like Kate Winslet's mother rather than her sister. (Thompson was 36 when the film was produced.) Hugh Grant is well cast as Elinor's suitor. Alan Rickman is ideal as Colonel Brandon. (We think of Rickman playing the role of a villain, but he has a much broader range than that.)There are four Sense & Sensibility versions available on DVD. I've seen and reviewed the 1971 version, directed by David Giles, and the 2008 version, directed by John Alexander. There's another version, from 1981, directed by Rodney Bennett, which I haven't seen.It's very interesting to see how three different directors, working with three different casts, can give us three different versions of the same novel. It would be interesting--but tedious--to pick out the ""best"" Elinor, the ""best Marianne,"" etc. However, there are real differences among the versions. It's the same novel, but it they're not the same movies.You'll have to see them all to make up your mind about which version you like best. Ang's Sense and Sensibility was meant for theaters, so something is lost on the small screen. Even so, it works well enough on DVD.. Find it and see it. You won't be disappointed.Note: Look for Hugh Laurie in a small supporting role. He's excellent.",Sense and Sensibility

28,jzappa,I Love Emma Thompson and That's That.,8,15 May 2008,"There is something consistent with my experience in English period pieces. I begin the film without any true excitement but just enough interest in the production values to remain engaged. The film progresses for awhile. I'm fine I suppose. Then a character commits a gross and consciously cruel act that makes me restless with anticipation for its compensation. The selfish wife of the Dashwood sisters' half brother, played with a mighty talent for the role of a social climbing snob by Harriet Walter, treats the sisters as unwelcome, knowing full well that they've just lost their father, once she seizes control of their father's estate. Kate Winslet's letters to Willoughby go unanswered, and he treats her coldly when he sees her at a party. He later sends Winslet a letter, enclosing their former correspondence and love tokens, including a lock of her hair and informing her that he is engaged to a very wealthy and high-born woman. Harriet Walter discovers Edward and Lucy's engagement and when he refuses to end it, she disinherits him, immediately turning it over to his brother. He remains engaged to a woman with whom he will not be happy.These are very astute accounts of a class-conscious society, portrayed through Emma Thompson's infectiously witty adaptation and Ang Lee's cultural range with the dry poise and posture of England's high society, awakening the viewer to a lifelike actualization of Jane Austen's story.Aside from the upholstery of Alan Rickman's likability and Hugh Grant's classic account of the formal and orderly English behavioral mainstay, Emma Thompson, who I see as unparalleled by nearly every other actress save for Meryl Streep, neither stands out nor is she upstaged in her performance as Elinor. She has a lack of any traces of narcissism that is in short supply in dramatic arts like film and theater, matched merely by Marisa Tomei or Olivia de Havilland and opposes what fuels the presence of all the great male acting legends. This ability to downplay a performance with hardly a conscious concern takes part in her balanced manifestation in Sense and Sensibility.It's Kate Winslet who crafts a character that I believe more closely relates to the id of Thompson, yet Winslet, an uncannily Apollonian actress, plays off of the antithesis Elinor presents in their relationship and echoes the sister with ""sense."" I believe this film is a raw example of two performers playing off each other.",Sense and Sensibility

Alan Rickman's voice and looks are very mysteriously attractive. I love Elinor's sharpness and intelligence. She is realistic but also caring.The landscapes and buildings are pretty much how I imagined they would look like while reading the book.The communication in this time was interesting to watch. You have to read in between the lines and there are indirect statements. I love how Elinor is very careful not to reveal weaknesses or negativities of her family to anyone.

Although all of the actors involved seemed to be playing themselves, they all appear to have been type-cast very well. Not one of them appeared to be inappropriate in their role, which also seems to show some good direction and production as well.Mrs Thompson's screenplay is succinct and carries the story nicely with a pace that enables the audience to remain interested.The story itself is the typical ""Boy Meets Girl"" romance that you would expect from Jane Austen and, to be honest, most films of the same time setting and for that matter every Hallmark Christmas film I've ever seen, but this has obviously had the money spent on it in order to support the talented cast and crew that brought it all together.I did find it hard to see Alan Rickman as anything but Professor Snape, but I'm sure that it is my fault for not watching this film before 'Harry Potter' and the role he embodied so fantastically. However Imelda Staunton was very definitely playing Professor Umbridge in the sickly sweet way that brings HP5's score on my films list down.Although Hugh Laurie's part was relatively small, I did find great amusement in his witty one liners and thought he was excellent.As for Emma, well she was made for films like this and although I don't really rate this style of film, she has always done a fantastic job and this performance is no exception.I'd also like to make a mention of poor Gemma Jones, who has the worst wardrobe all the way through and is, in actual fact, a very underrated actress, who always seems to get lumbered with a terrible outfit in whatever she's in (See Bridget Jones, Rocketman, Harry Potter).It really isn't my sort of film being far too much like 'Eddie Izzard's' description of a Merchant Ivory film (If you haven't seen it, Google it!).

But he did insist that John watch over them and let them live in his inherited abode. However, John is married to a rather overbearing wife named Fanny (Harriet Walter) who eventually convinces John that they can look after themselves. But the women who can't get or inherit, so their only way to get out of their doldrums is to marry rich guys and find true love.Emma Thompson (Golden Globe winner for Best Screenplay) plays the eldest daughter Elinor who's an old maid who can keep her emotions in balance. Meanwhile middle daughter Marianne (Kate Winslet) is quite the polar opposite to Elinor as she is a very emotionally charged teenager who would love to have a man in her life. And the youngest daughter Margaret (Emilie Francois) who is a high-opinionated tomboy who also has a thing for romance.The story drives into full gear when Fanny's brother Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant) enters their down-trodden lives who seems to know about the dilemma these ladies are facing and shows immediate compassion towards them. He becomes like father-figure to little Margaret and has a mutual attraction to eldest daughter, Elinor. While Edward and Elinor are have a proper ways of showing their emotions, Marianne doesn't find him that attractive and she thinks he's stoic. Soon Fanny manipulates Mrs. Dashwood that Elinor only wants to marry Edward over money rather than true love. Eventually he gets called back to London.Eventually, the women get to live in a country cottage which was given to them by their matchmaking relatives. Alan Rickman breaks from type-casting to play a compassionate colonel Brandon who has feeling for the much younger Marianne and seems charmed by musicianship and her melodic voice. but Marianne has no interest in Col. Brandon even though Mrs. Jennings (Elizabeth Spriggs) about all of his good traits. However, Marianne falls head over heels with a young man named Mr. Willoughby (Greg Wise)who literally swept her off her feet after she twisted her ankle in the falling rain. She eventually enjoys Willoughby's company as they go around town on his horse-drawn carriage much to the chagrin of older sister Elinor. Just when Willoughby is about ask Marianne to marry him, he gets sent back to London for an indefinite period of time. While this is happening another lady arrives on the scene. Her name is Lucy Steele (Imogen Stubbs) who tells Elinor that she and Edward has been engaged for five years. Feeling that the Dashwood daughters' romantic lives are hopeless, Mrs. Jennings decides that the ladies should all go to London.When they reach London the climax starts to unfold. What's amazing is that the ladies and the audience are expecting a happy ending as we anticipate secrets within the characters are revealed. The acting is what carries the film the whole way through and as we watch, we feel like we are a part of these characters lives and we feel for them the whole way through.The acting isn't the only thing that makes ""Sense and Sensibility"" such an engaging film. Michael Coulter's cinematography was pure eye-candy and the costumes look and feel the time period between 1792 to 1797. The DVD extras are something quite noteworthy too which includes commentaries from star and scriptwriter Emma Thompson, co-producer Lindsay Doran, from director Ang Lee and co-producer James Schamus. Also featured are trailers for other films like ""Howard's End"" and ""Remains of the Day"". It's a film you should really check out. Especially for those who appreciate the work of Jane Austen.",Sense and Sensibility
42,JuguAbraham,"A Golden Bear winner wins a solitary academy award for a ""picture-postcard"" effort from a Chinese director",7,7 January 2005,"I am always interested in how a movie is received on both sides of the Atlantic. This is a film that won the top award at Berlin, but picked up a well deserved academy award for Emma Thompson--not for her acting skills but for her writing skills. Turning Jane Austen into delectable cinema is not an easy chore.The film is unusual. Chinese director Ang Lee (""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"") is not an obvious director that could have brought this literary work on screen--yet he deserves full credit in making the film as a top notch Britisher would have done. Even the executive producer is an American director of no mean repute--Sidney Pollack, who must have known that he was investing in a winner.I applaud Mr Lee for working with cinematographer Michael Coulter to make a film with so many shots that could have made so many picture-postcards. English landscapes have rarely looked so lovely. Details like ladies negotiating horse droppings make the film realistic or the silent appraisal by Willoughby's lady friend of Mariannae Dashwood (Kate Winslet) at the dance are executed with care and intelligence, not common in Chinese cinema. Mr Lee is truly international.Alan Rickman, for once, restrains his histrionics and is a pleasure to watch him interact with well chosen cast.What this film achieves is not merely introduce Jane Austen to new readers, but also argue that literary works can be modified intelligently on screen, without losing authenticity of the original, not just by the English but by people from far away lands. The Berlin Festival jury realized this very well.",Sense and Sensibility
43,philip_vanderveken,To my own surprise I must admit that I really liked it.,7,20 September 2005,"Normally I would never have watched this movie, because I'm not all that much a fan of costume drama's. And since I've seen several of them lately without seeing all that much difference between them all, I didn't think that I would like it all that much. But when I read a review in a popular magazine, saying that even when you aren't a fan of this kind of films, you should give it a try because it's so much better than the average movie in the genre, I must admit that I was quite curious about it. Also the fact that it was from the director Ang Lee made me hope for the best.When Mr. Dashwood dies, almost all his belongings go to his son from his first marriage, leaving his second wife and three daughters in a difficult situation. They haven't got much money and can't stay on the estate, but are taken in by a kind cousin who gives them a small cottage to live in. Because they aren't wealthy, it isn't very easy for the two oldest daughters, the practical Elinor and the romantic Marianne, to find a suitable partner. Both find a man who seems to be perfect at first, but who aren't all that great after all. But after the rain always comes sunshine and one day the two women find a man to their taste who truly loves them...If there is one thing that you can't accuse him of, than it must be that Ang Lee always sticks to one certain genre. After having seen ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and the western ""Ride with the Devil"", this certainly is a completely different experience. And surprisingly enough, I must say that it works. I never thought that a man born in Taiwan would be that good in recreating a world that has never been his. I don't think it must be easy for an Asian person to recreate Victorian England or the USA during the Civil War, but it works and that's all that really matters. Next to the good directing, I also couldn't help noticing the fine acting by all the leading actors. There wasn't one that stood out above the rest, but there wasn't one that didn't fit in either. They all did a very good job and that's something that you don't always find in a movie.Even though I know that this was the way it all happened during that time period, I must say that I sometimes had a lot of difficulties with the lack of emotions and the fact that they didn't always say what they thought. I sometimes really wanted to say to one of the characters: 'come on, finally tell them what you have got to say, don't stay there quiet all the time, you're working on my nerves with that behavior...', but this was a movie, so I had to stay quiet myself. Still, it really worked on my nerves sometimes and that did spoil my fun from time to time. However, don't get me wrong, this certainly doesn't mean that I didn't like the movie at all.Overall this is indeed a movie that is a lot better than the average in the genre. The acting is very good, the story is interesting,... and for once it all made me forget about everything that I hate about the genre. When you know that I normally give a movie of this kind a rating of 6/10, than you'll be quite surprised to see that I give this one a rating in between 7/10 and 7.5/10. To my own surprise I must admit that I really liked it.",Sense and Sensibility
44,bandw,Production values trump the story,8,20 March 2006,"The production values of this movie are impeccable: the acting is first rate, the cinematography exquisite, the score enhances without intruding, and the attention to period detail reflects a labor of love. All of this alone makes the film worth watching.Approaching the story from a 21st century American sensibility is a challenge, but I suppose that is one of the values of seeing this. So many times I just wanted to see the people be just a *little* more forthcoming in expressing themselves and explaining their behaviors. London is made to appear like a black hole, mysteriously sucking the male protagonists into its center at periodic intervals, leaving the women, and the viewer, to sit around endlessly speculating as to why (and never coming close to guessing correctly). I assume that Jane Austen knew what she was talking about when she wrote this story of upper class manners and morals in early 19th century England, and that Emma Thompson tried to preserve the plot line and spirit of the novel. But, as well presented as they are, the story and the characters did not involve me as deeply as I would have hoped. I suppose Jane Austen must accept much responsibility for any weaknesses in the story.It is interesting to note what things have changed and what things have not in the last 200 years. People, at least in America, are much more open - perhaps too much so with people spilling their guts on national talk shows (""I was a teenage bulimarexic bisexual living in a cave with wolves""), but is the restraint on display in ""Sense and Sensibility"" to be preferred? Maybe something in between? One thing that has not changed is that people still frequently choose money over love and money seemed to be a central concern for many of the characters in this movie.""Sense and Sensibility"" is thought to extol romantic love, but I am not so sure of that. Marianne came to accept Colonel Brandon as more of a sensible choice, rather than a passionate soul mate. And how much hope do we have for Elinor and the feckless Edward? And what of those marriages for money?As apparently disparate as ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" are, there are significant similarities. Ang Lee's appreciation for, and ability to capture on film, natural settings of great beauty equals what we have in ""Sense and Sensibility,"" and the settings play an integral part in both films. Repressed emotion is essential to the personalities of both Ennis Del Mar and Elinor Dashwood and both suffer the pangs of unfulfilled love. Even though both movies have sheep in them, the sheep in ""Sense and Sensibility"" are ever so much more bucolic and genteel.",Sense and Sensibility
45,DeeNine-2,"Although it rained, we saw no mud",9,16 March 2000,"This would appear to be the sort of production the Academy votes as best picture, and indeed Sense and Sensibility was duly nominated in 1996, but lost out to Braveheart. I'm not sure why, but my guess is that Sense and Sensibility lacked something in the minds of the members of the Academy, call it dirt.Everything is a little too pretty, a little too clean and well behaved in this charming adaptation of Jane Austen's first novel. Director Ang Lee might have provided some insight into early 19th century England by showing the poverty and squalor of the London streets instead of just having the girls step around a little horse manure. Lee might also have shown that the servants had it worse than the gentry by expanding the scene where they are let go by showing just where some of them did go. Lee's direction hints at the wider world of poverty and real pain, but rejects having it intrude. Although the full force of the industrial revolution and attendant horrors were yet to come, they might have been presaged so that Austen's world is given perspective for the modern audience. Soon the skies of England would be blackened with smoke from coal and most of its citizens turned into proletarian cogs.But Austen knew and/or cared about that not at all, and instead wrote with singular attention about the gentry and their acquisitive aspirations and genteel manners, and this is the novel that Emma Thompson captured so well in her Academy Award winning screenplay. The fact that the Dashwoods lost their estate and had to live in a cottage and practice thrift within a budget was a very real tragedy to Austen, although not to us. She was obsessed with the injustice of being a young woman without means living within a society that allowed upward mobility by women only through marriage. So she showed women playing that game to perfection, and winning.Emma Thompson as the sensible Elinor Dashwood was flawless, as usual; and Kate Winslet as her sister, the sensual Marianne who wears her heart on her sleeve, proved once again that she is a gifted and charismatic actress second to none. The supporting cast, especially Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings, and Harriet Walter as Fanny Dashwood, was superb. The cinematography was gorgeous, even arresting at times.Most uncomfortable scene: Marianne being bled. This reminds us that sometimes one has to overcome both the disease and the physician.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

46,frankde-jong,Marriage etiquette from the 18th century,8,1 June 2021,"""Sense and sensibility"" is about the marriage of two sisters.The two sisters have very different personalities. Elinor (played by Emma Thompson) is introverted (the ""sense"" from the title) and Marianne (played by Kate Winslet) is extrovert (the ""sensibility"" from the title).The financial situation of the sisters is however the same. Born in a wealthy family their financial situation has deteriorated when, at the death of their father, the heritage went largely to the eldest son (as usual in England at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century).Both factors (personality and financial situation) are relevant because marriage was at that time not only an emotional but also a business matter. Jane Austen, the writer of the novel of the same name on which the film is based, was of the opinion that marriage ought to be predominantly an emotional matter. In her time however, she was one of the few.It may seems strange to select a director from Asia to adapt such a typical English story. Ang Lee was born in Taiwan but went to the USA when he was only 21. After that he alternated Eastern movies (for example ""Eat, drink, man, woman"" (1994)) with Westen ones (such as ""Sense and sensibility"" from 1995. By the way because of his Asian background Ang Lee has maybe more affinity with marriage not only being an emotional and individual decision but also a family (and business) affair than contemporary Englishmen.",Sense and Sensibility

48,tim-764-291856,The Seminal Sense & Sensibility?,9,19 April 2012,"I've long resisted period drama, citing it as nostalgic pomp for elderly ladies and as all the so called classics, involved gooey and rather non- sensical 'romance', that made them even more boring.Middle age, naturally, started to change that plus a greater understanding and respect for the genre. It IS largely about the only thing that British film-makers can reliably do well, right?Except, of course, Taiwanese master-director Ang Lee got hold of this one, serenely pumping it with majesty, poise and prose. Not a second of running time is wasted, the pacing is perfect, every frame counts. The casting, some of which on their own and in average quality films can be awful (Hugh Grant, for instance), along with Emma Thompson's simple but eloquent Oscar winning script, turn these bit actors into very good ones.Those who are reading this and other reviews will surely know the story of Mr Darcy and co., probably much better than I do, so I'm not going there.One of my all-time favourites, Kate Winslett, is superb, of course, radiating both naivety and female knowing, often at the same time. Emma Thompson, here as her older sister Elinor Dashwood, is usually someone - or usually plays people - that I don't like much - but here she is totally natural and convincing.Looking at the list of filming locations on the IMDb, so many were within ten miles of where I live (Salisbury) and I have visited, that that reality is very intense. The locations are always beautifully and sympathetically portrayed and presented and indeed, many are quite modest, compared to other adaptations, which is all for the better.This film has been on TV quite a few times and will always be, it's an evergreen classic, a rare thing in that both critics and public adore it equally. I actually bought the DVD, in a box-set along with 'Pride & Prejudice' and 'Atonement', both directed by Joe Wright.

Obviously, their salvation remains in marriage with a wealthier partner who can offer them a better life, but this aspect will prove to be much harder than expected, as the pretenders can hardly accept such poor wives.It's a movie which presents the difficult lives of three sisters who are forced to live in poverty after their father's death. Although they fall in love pretty soon after, their lovers leave them as sudden as they appeared, leaving them hopeless, especially due to their social position and lack of wealth. Although it had a quite interesting premise, the result proved to be a mixture of boredom and seemingly pointless events which ultimately lead to a predictable and unsatisfying happy ending. It left an impression that it simply lacked any perspective, with simplistic characters and action, bound to make you yawn at an alarming rate. While it's not a bad movie overall, it lacks a strong premise and overall suspense, which leaves you without any feelings for the characters and their unfortunate fate. It failed in attracting the viewer and convincing him that its characters deserve a better future than they have, thus leaving him (the viewer) without any satisfaction after the end.It's a below average movie which can be easily skipped.",Sense and Sensibility
52,FilmOtaku,Another beautiful Ang Lee film,7,19 August 2003,"Ang Lee is quickly and quietly turning into one of my favorite directors it seems.  I have now seen four of his films and every one of them is brilliant and beautiful.  Sense and Sensibility should not have been attractive to me: Not only am I not crazy about period pieces and Jane Austen, but I'm even less crazy about Kate Winslet.  However, the acting, the lush, beautiful cinematography and beautiful score won me over in a big way.Sense and Sensibility stars Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet as sisters, who are left poor after their father dies, therefore are basically poison for future husbands because of their lack of a dowry to offer.  This doesn't stop them from love, however, which causes many problems and heart break. Thompson is the `sensible' sister.  She is reserved and nurturing, while Winslet is the overtly passionate and artistic one.  Their acting, as well as the excellent supporting cast's performances are wonderful and believable.  The real star is the direction however.  The incredible landscapes and the beautiful cinematography is a character in itself.  In one particular scene, Winslet is taking a walk after hearing some unfortunate news, and the very atmosphere around her envelops her and makes the scene so much more fulfilling.  Ang Lee is a brilliant artist, and has shown such amazing versatility with his portfolio of work that anytime I hear that a new Lee film is going to be released I will see it unconditionally.An excellent film that is more drama than comedy  I highly recommend it.--Shelly",Sense and Sensibility
53,gelman@attglobal.net,"Well written, well acted -- lovely",10,3 December 2006,"I have a weakness for movies derived from Jane Austen's novels -- I'll admit it. But this is a standout. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet are perfectly cast as the two emotional opposites of the title with Hugh Grant as the aspiring clergyman who is the ultimate match to Emma Thompson's character and Alan Rickman as the colonel who captures Kate's character after the man she initially falls madly in love with marries someone else for her money. Ang Lee is the director. In her speech accepting the Golden Globes award for best screenplay (which she actually did write), Emma Thompson, imitating Jane Austen's style, called him ""this foreign person"" who turned out ""to understand me better than I understood myself."" As in all the Jane Austen movies that stay within the period, the English countryside is the gorgeous backdrop against which the romance plays out -- at least half of the film's beauty. In a sense, Jane Austen wrote only one novel again and again: young women search for love in a world where first sons inherit and younger sons are under pressure to marry wealth. The major female characters in Austen novels are genteel but lack dowries and so they must either find wealthy husbands, fall in love with second sons prepared to be disinherited for the sake of that love, follow the course of impropriety or resign themselves to spinsterhood. We are not shown genuine poverty (though one assumes that the many servants in Jane Austen's stories live less luxuriously than the ""impoverished"" families they loyally serve). Austen novels are invariably about the social interplay between the very, very wealthy and the genteel poor with a rake or two in the mix to tempt young women to disgrace themselves. Of their type, they are unsurpassed in English literature, and they make wonderful movies as both Hollywood and the British film industry have shown again and again by returning to the same fountain for yet another draught.

However this movie follows the storyline just like a book and does not deviate from it. Does it mean that a scriptwriter has no job to do? No way. Of course the book can hold so much more stories, characters, and emotions than the movie. Moving this great story onto the screen with time limit needs much editing. A scriptwriter boldly cuts away unnecessary and small events and focuses on important matters which affect characters' thoughts and emotions. I really appreciate Ang Lee's respect to the original literature. He exactly comprehends what Jane Austen wrote in the book.

60,roghache,"Subtle & romantic period piece, though one heroine is rather despicable",8,4 June 2006,"This is a beautifully photographed and costumed period piece that reflects 18th Century English attitudes toward romance. Matches were often made based on financial constraints, less financially secure young ladies being at the mercy of their charms in attracting a husband with suitable prospects. The movie also features an absolutely stellar Oscar nominated performance by Emma Thompson. Although I didn't read Jane Austen's novel, I generally love films depicting this more genteel and subtle period with its gracious manners, formal methods of address, and undeclared emotions. However, I must admit that this particular story is not my favourite. I found the tale a trifle plodding at times especially near the beginning, and actually found the character of the second sister downright despicable! The story revolves around around the family of the rich Mr. Dashwood, who has died and left his estate to the son his first wife. His second wife and her three daughters (Elinor, Marianne, and the young Margaret) are placed in considerable financial difficulty, forcing them to live with a cousin who has kindly agreed to take them in. The two marriageable but penniless sisters are polar opposites, Elinor being restrained and practical while Marianne is demonstrative and romantic. Elinor's budding relationship with the wealthy and kind Edward Ferrars faces unexpected obstacles while Marianne is courted by two very different suitors, the dashing young Mr. Willoughby and the rich & worthy but much older Colonel Brandon.The highlight of this tale is the magnificent performance by Emma Thompson as the restrained Elinor. As the only practical lady of the family, she must manage the difficult accounts and see to both the spirited Marianne and the difficult young Margaret. Personally, I did not find this actress too old for the role as she is cast as the spinster of the piece with marriage past due. It makes her story more compelling that she has waited so long for romance. Elinor suffers in silence from unrequited love, all the while enduring the incessant whining, weeping, and cruel & mocking barbs of the middle sister, Marianne. Though portrayed well by the lovely Kate Winslet, the spoiled Marianne made me absolutely want to slap her throughout the movie. Although she does perhaps mature a trifle as events unfold, I could hardly picture any viewer caring a hoot whether or not this totally self absorbed girl lives happily ever after with her true love. Throughout the tale she exhibits an unfortunate tendency to run off into the countryside during rainstorms, requiring gallant rescue efforts by heroic gentlemen on horseback, clad in splendid black top coats & hats, all resulting in much strife for herself and her poor family.As for the gentlemen in question, Alan Rickman plays the magnificent Colonel Brandon, who is everything a hero of that era should be. Not a 'pretty boy' but a chiselled and compelling mature figure that is the very essence of kindness. As for Willoughby, from first sight I detested this handsome creature with his Shakespearean sonnets. Hugh Grant is perfect in his typical stammering, bumbling role as Edward, the object of Elinor's affections, but I wished he had been featured in more scenes. For at least 90 minutes of the film, he simply doesn't appear.Other notable characters include the girls' nasty sister-in-law, Fanny Dashwood, the irritating Lucy Steele with her mysterious connections, and Edward's rather foolish brother, Robert. The youngest Dashwood sister, Margaret, is an endearing little nuisance, exhibiting a fondness for geography, her tree house, and telling tales her sisters might have preferred left untold! Edward seems to have a touching rapport with this challenging young minx.The green English country scenery is lovely, the period costumes magnificent, the horse drawn carriages elegant, the lavishly furnished manors grand, the balls splendid, and so forth. There's an interesting glimpse into one of the more bizarre medical procedures of that era as well as all the usual courtly practices of calling cards and bowing politely to guests being received. It's escapist entertainment watching it all, and quite refreshing to enjoy a movie totally lacking in sex, profanity, and violence. Also, the selfless Elinor's heartbreaking venture into the romantic realm is indeed extremely touching. However, I would have preferred a more sympathetic second heroine to cheer for as well, in keeping with Jane Austen's other famous tale, Pride and Prejudice.",Sense and Sensibility

62,dr_clarke_2,"A great piece of work from Ang Lee, but also from Emma Thompson",10,28 March 2021,"British audiences love a costume drama and the nineteen nineties saw a plethora of costume dramas both on television and in the cinema based on the novels of Jane Austen. Ang Lee's 1995 film version of Sense and Sensibility is a superb example of both, thanks to his thoughtful direction and a fine screenplay by its star Emma Thompson.Austen's novel and therefore the film follows the love lives of the two older Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, after they, their younger sister and their mother are left in reduced circumstances by the death of their father and the scheming of their half-uncle's greedy wife Fanny. It boasts all of Austen's usual trademarks, with gentle satire on issues of class and gender, multiple potential suitors (one of whom turns out to be a bit of a bounder), and an unapologetically happy ending. Thompson's screenplay tweaks some of the characterisation to appeal to modern audiences, but retains Austen's effervescent wit in much of the dialogue.Thompson plays Elinor, the more sensible and reserved of the sisters, whilst Kate Winslet plays the headstrong Marianne, and they both give delightful performances, supported by a superb cast. Harriet Walter is brilliantly waspish as the snobbish, calculating Fanny Dashwood; Robert Hardy and Elizabeth Spriggs vie to steal the show as the eccentric Sir John Middleton and his equally eccentric mother-in-law Mrs Jennings; Hugh Grant is effortlessly charming and endearing as Edward Ferrars; Alan Rickman is well-cast as the quiet, honourable Colonel Brandon; Greg Wise is suitably dashing and convincingly caddish as John Willoughby, Marianne's other potential suitor; and Gemma Jones is delightful as Elinor and Marianne's well-meaning, optimistic mother, who believes in marriage for love. Emilie Françoise plays the third Dashwood sister Margaret; having never acted before, she holds her own in some pretty illustrious acting company.There are few surprises in the story, because Austen's stories now always seem comfortably familiar (at least to we British), but there is one big surprise in production terms. Ang Lee was unfamiliar with Austen and new to British period dramas not to mention entirely English language films, so it's astonishingly impressive that he delivers such an accomplished and visually impressive film. His use of the extensive location filming at various English country estates is extraordinarily beautiful even by the standards of British (and usually English) period dramas. But perhaps his greatest talent is in getting naturalistic performances out of his cast, reportedly insisting on this rather than theatrical ones. Lee has subsequently noted in interviews that he approached the film as a mix of social satire and a family drama - which fundamentally it is - and his approach works perfectly. At the same time, his mise-en-scéne is flawless; filming in assorted country piles undoubtedly helped, but the attention to detail in every aspect of the production is noteworthy. Patrick Doyle's characteristically elegant score feels like a perfect final flourish.Ultimately, Sense and Sensibility is polished but engaging, and despite the vast gulf in lifestyles between Austen's characters and a great many viewers, it is still possible to sympathise with them, in part thanks to Thompson's careful adjustments. It's a great piece of work from Ang Lee, but also from Emma Thompson and pretty much everyone who played a part in making it.",Sense and Sensibility
63,SMK-4,Lacking a modern perspective,6,16 August 1999,"A solid adaptation of the Jane Austen novel, but still somewhat disappointing. The problem with this film is not (as so often in classic's adaptations) failing to be true to the original, but erring in the other extreme - the film fails to give the story a modern perspective.A problem with Austen's novels from a modern point of view is that it becomes increasingly difficult to care for the heroines and the supposedly hard times they have fallen into.  What made them deserve their original wealth in the first place, what makes the benefactors of their temporary misfortune so undeserving in comparison?  The intended audience of Austen's novels were people belonging to the same social class, people who could naturally identify with the situation the Dashwoods would find themselves in.With a modern audience it is different.  When we see the Miss Dashwoods sitting in a beautiful garden on a sunny day, being read poetry by Colonel Brandon, then the word 'suffering' doesn't readily spring to mind.  We also notice their servants who completely fail to feature in the story - people of their class apparently do not matter.  The film adaptation should have addressed these problems but Emma Thompson preferred to stay close to the original.  As a result, this film makes fine viewing ... for people who own large estates in Somerset.",Sense and Sensibility

The cinematography is excellent, the art direction as well, the script was well written(dull sometimes), the acting was indeed good, but the story simply does not stimulate. Nothing happens in the entire film. The conflicts between the girls and their 'mens' are ridiculous. No cool at all. Not to mention the clichés used in this film, including the biggest one used in the end. Such a bore since the beginning until the end. The jokes were like shoots and misses every time. Gosh. I heard beforehand the 'critics' opinions saying that this film was very funny. What a big lie. Perhaps, the only thing you can be sure about this film is that it is a boredom without an end. Shame on Ang Lee. And despite Emma Thompson's admirable effort to adapt the Jane Austen's book, the film itself just fell in the category of pointless films made. I would not recommend this film, unless if you do like stories in the style of Jane Eyre but more cliché and lighthearted. 6.2/10",Sense and Sensibility
66,Hermit C-2,A classic for all time.,10,18 May 1999,"Whoever says they just don't make the quality of pictures today that they used to hasn't seen or is ignoring this film.That Emma Thompson is one of the greatest actresses working is no secret. But who would have expected such a miracle from her in the screenwriting department? Some of the most dramatic moments in 'Sense and Sensibility' come from her pen, not Jane Austen's, difficult as that may be to believe. For instance, the scene in which Col. Brandon (Alan Rickman) carries in the ill Marianne Dashwood (Kate Winslet), echoing the earlier scene where Willoughby (Greg Wise) brought the injured young woman home was Thompson's doing. Marianne's illness also is responsible for much more drama in the movie than in the book. And I'm an Austen fan! I can't recall another writer bringing so much good of his or her own to a classic like this.I suppose the director, cinematographer, production designer, etc. deserve to share the credit when a movie is this outstanding, but with such a super group of actors on the screen (from top to bottom) it's easy to heap all the praise on them. I had unconsciously (and unfairly) pigeonholed Alan Rickman based on the other role I'd seen him in, the villain in 'Die Hard,' so he was quite a surprise to me. The real bombshell, however, was my first exposure to Kate Winslet. After seeing this movie and Kenneth Branagh's 'Hamlet' I can say I can't remember another young actress who has impressed me so much. And she played these difficult roles by the time she was 20! Many of the other cast members are a part of an excellent group that Thompson and Branagh have often worked with in the past.I realized that 'S&S' had become one of my all-time favorite movies when I found myself watching it every chance I got when it came on TV. I think it's bumped 'Raging Bull' off my personal top 10 list.",Sense and Sensibility
67,dy158,The first Jane Austen work I really like,8,7 July 2009,"Much has been said about Jane Austen's probably most famous work Pride and Prejudice but for me, Sense and Sensibility will always have a special place because it was the first work from Austen I read during my teenage days. I did read Pride and Prejudice too but it was much later. Still, what began as me curious about the title (Sense and Sensibility) when I first came across it at the school library eventually had me in love with the novel.Mr. Dashwood's passing meant that the rich man had left behind his wife and three daughters Elinor (Emma Thompson), Marianne (Kate Winslet) and Margaret. And a son John from his previous marriage. Because a large part of the estate Mr. Dashwood had left behind will be going to John, leaving Mrs. Dashwood (from his second marriage) and her daughters with almost nothing. Almost penniless, they are in need of a place to live. Sir John Middleton, cousin of widowed Mrs. Dashwood, took them in. That was the beginning of the Dashwoods and their exposure to the wider society.It was at Sir John's estate where Marianne meet Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman), with whom the latter is in love with the second Dashwood daughter from the first time he set his eyes on her. But, there is also the dashing but deceitful John Willoughby (Greg Wise) vying for Marianne's attention and it looks like she is more taken by him than Colonel Brandon. But even before Marianne has two men chasing for her affections, her older sister Elinor meets Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), who actually happens to have an older sister Fanny who is the wife of Elinor's step-brother John (with Fanny being snobby at the same time). While Elinor is reserved, practical and thus is the 'sense' in the title, her younger sister Marianne is more emotional and romantic and thus forming the 'sensibility'. The two Dashwood sisters' characteristics would eventually shone through with what they encountered with their attachments to Ferrars (Elinor), Willoughy, Colonel Brandon (Marianne).It was tested during the Dashwoods' trip to London. But before London, Elinor had learned that Ferrars had been secretly engaged to another by the name of Lucy Steele. It was at a ball in London where the two Dashwood sisters in Elinor and Marianne found out that John Willoughy had actually being engaged to an extremely wealthy Miss Grey, much to the dismay of Marianne who had always thought that Willoughy had always loved her. At the same time, the secret engagement between Edward Ferrars and Lucy Steele came to light with Edward's mother demanding her son to break off the engagement. But Edward who is being true to his word, did not do so. Meanwhile, Lucy met Edward's younger brother Robert.Back in the country, Marianne could not resist making a visit to Willoughy as she and her sister Elinor were stopping for the night at the Palmers who live near Willoughy. But the weather had other ideas and while on her way to meet Willoughy, Marianne became seriously ill and was treated by her older sister. Together with the arrival of Colonel Brandon and Elinor constantly by her sister's side, Marianne did recovered and they returned home.But, the sisters learned that Lucy Steele has gotten married to a Mr. Ferrars. Elinor assumed that was Edward and she was heartbroken. That was when Edward showed up and explained that Lucy is actually married to his younger brother and not him. Edward then proposed to Elinor which she accepted and not only that, Colonel Brandon had asked for Marianne's hand and she accepted. Both sisters eventually got married on the same day.Emma Thompson who plays the elder Dashwood sister Elinor in the film title of the same name, is actually the screenwriter of the film adaptation from one of Jane Austen's beloved works. It is also equally amazing that the director of this film adaptation is Taiwanese-born director Ang Lee. For both Lee and Thompson especially, to be able to adapt a 19th-century novel for a modern audience...is quite an achievement in itself. It never got lost in translation for me, that is for sure.",Sense and Sensibility

72,gcsman,"An absolute, enduring delight of a film. Stands the test of time",10,15 November 2020,"What a surprise that this year is the 25th anniversary for 'Sense and Sensibility'. It has got to be the definitive screen version of the endearing Jane Austen novel, and it was properly recognized as such at the time. Can it really be that long? It's just as much of a delight to see it again now. If you haven't seen it yet -- or haven't seen it for many years -- don't waste another minute. Go right to Netflix and watch young Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant, and Alan Rickman bring these wonderful characters to life. And finally rejoice in one of the happiest of happy endings in all of literature.On seeing it again, what strikes me is its economy, and all credit to Emma Thompson's scriptwork for that. It gives us a clean, clear line through the story, making the right cuts and emphases, and introducing each character in just the right way at just the right time. Nothing's wasted but nothing is really missed that is essential. Every minute of screen time is essential and our only wish at the end is that we could spend more time with these people that we have grown to love.There is so much else to take away though. The settings, scenes, and daily activities play no part in the actual dialog, but what's seen is just as important as what's said. Two hundred years ago, people *read*. They read books in the afternoons by the window, and at night by candlelight. They walked -- for pleasure, for exercise and conversation, for necessity. The natural world wasn't just something outside a window. And of course (this being England) they had manners and civilized speech. Sometimes it is used to disguise unloving manipulation (as with Harriet Walter's character Fanny, the Dashwood's sister-in-law) but it is also the glue that holds society together at every level.What to say about the actors that hasn't already been said by reviewers over and over again? All four of the principals are just wonderful. Kate Winslet's Marianne (the ""Sense"" of the title) is the direct, outward-looking girl who lives impulsively and open-heartedly. Emma Thompson's Elinor (""Sensibility"") has more of an inward life and is the responsible, practical-minded bedrock on which her mother and sisters rely. Hugh Grant (Edward Ferrars) is perfectly suited to his role as the shy, considerate, well-spoken young man who would like nothing more than to take up a little parsonage in the countryside despite his family's ambitions for him. And Alan Rickman (as Colonel Brandon) is the accomplished country squire wondering how to capture Marianne's heart, having loved her at first sight. Among all the secondary cast there's hardly a false note either. Emile Francois (as little sister Margaret) and Gemma Jones (as Mrs. Dashwood) are excellent, as are Elizabeth Spriggs and Robert Hardy as the over-the-top extroverted landlords. Greg Wise has the somewhat thankless job of portraying the handsome cad Willoughby whom Marianne must grow past.We can't do without a single one of them. But even among a strong cast, Thompson stands out -- she is the one we most hope for and that somehow, she and Edward will get together against all the odds that society and his family build up against them. We know that Thompson can deliver that period-English dialog perfectly, but those eyes ... she can convey depths and nuances with those wonderful eyes that words simply can't. Among her standout scenes are the critical night where Marianne is lying ill (I'd guess from pneumonia -- this is a dramatic change from the book, where she is only laid up for a while). She and her sister are constantly at odds with one another, but their love is genuine and deep, and here while Marianne lies unconscious and close to death, Elinor is clearly staring into the abyss as she whispers ""don't leave me alone"". The other scene, of course, is at the very end when Edward finally, finally is free to visit and tell Elinor that he is hers if she would like -- at which point she bursts into uncontrollable tears. The audience may not have seen that coming, but it is an absolutely perfect way to resolve it all.All the main actors have gone on to greater fame and glory (though sadly we've lost Alan Rickman) but they have never done better than in this film. An absolute classic worth all the awards it got.One postscript: on IMDb, this is a VERY rare case where there are more ratings from female viewers than male (usually males outnumber females by 3:1 or more). That may not be too surprising, but the male votes are also pretty much as high as the female ones, which shows its universal appeal.",Sense and Sensibility
73,destinylives52,Very Good Adaptation,8,11 September 2017,"This adaptation of the Jane Austen novel of the same title stars Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet as two sisters with different personalities who do their best to manage suitors and a much downgraded lifestyle than they were accustomed to. Thompson is the eldest sister, reserved and growing an attachment to a man who cannot seem to express his intent toward her; and Winslet is the headstrong, passionate sister who rushes into a romantic relationship with a man who is as passionate and lively as she, but spurns the affections of an older, emotionally reserved man. The secrets of the suitors will eventually be brought to light, and how the sisters handle these secrets will either destroy or uplift them.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Sense And Sensibility"" is the scene when Thomson's love interest tells her the full story of why he did the things he did, and how he wants to proceed in the immediate future. I realize it's a bland recounting, but it was done to not spoil what I consider the most dramatic part of the movie.Everything about this movie is superbexcept the running time. At 136 minutes, parts of Austen's novel had to be cut and/or trimmed down; and when you do that, it obviously damages the story. For those who think this adaptation is amazing as it stands, I suggest you watch the near 3 hour BBC version which deserves an A+ rating.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Sense and Sensibility

To be fair, I don't get Jane Austen's popularity - she appears to be Mills and Boon from another century and I find it unsatisfying. I have seen a previous version of this - done on BBC budget by the look of it - and this is tons better, I enjoy the standard of acting, direction, you name it, but I keep waiting for it to get interesting and it doesn't. I fail to understand why all the accolades are heaped upon these books/movies. I guess I will keep trying to see what the appeal is, but at least there is a finite amount of Austen.

75,pekinman,It's better than McGrath's 'Emma',8,14 October 2008,"I've finished a Jane Austen double feature evening with Ang Lee's 'Sense and Sensibility' preceded by Douglas McGrath's 'Emma' both from the mid 1990s.McGrath's 'Emma' left me Luke-warm and slightly sleepy, but Lee's 'Sense and Sensibility' achieved greater heights of interest in emotional involvement. Emma Thompson has done a splendid adaptation of what must have been a daunting task, turning an Austen novel into a film script. Most attempts at such a thing fall short of the mark. McGrath's film glosses over the surface of 'Emma' in a way that short-changes the viewer, leaving out characters, many scenes and much subtlety. Thompson's script of Austen's earlier novel manages to capture fully the many facets of her complex characters and elicits strong emotional responses from the viewer, at least it did from me. The last half hour prior to the happy ending was pretty draining on the tear ducts. Don't be fooled into thinking this is what is called a 'womans picture', it isn't. It is deeply romantic but never mawkish as so often happened in 'Emma'. The settings are much more real than those in 'Emma' which seemed designed solely as eye candy. There is always a visceral sense of being in early 19th century England, whereas in 'Emma' one starts thinking we are viewing a lavish Olde England-land at Disney World.There are no weak links in Lee's film as far as casting goes. It could be argued that Emma Thompson is a too old for Eleanore Dashwood, considering she has an 11 year old sister. Thompson looks a good 40! But she acts with her usual aplomb, though she seems to have fallen into her Margaret Schlegel (Howards End) rut, but she rises superbly to the highly emotional ending. Kate Winslet is perfect as her sister Marianne. The supporting cast is excellent, especially the laconic Hugh Laurie (Mr Palmer) married to a chattering busy-body (Imelda Staunton). Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant but his is a highly adaptable personality and plays Edward Farris very nicely. Alan Rickman is at his most lugubrious but then Col. Brandon is such a man. Though Rickman's mumbling mouth full of porridge was more like something out of Poe, Usher or somebody like that. A Col. who served in India, no matter how disappointed in life, would surely speak up more clearly. The musical score, cinematography and set design are not to be faulted. All in all, a much better Austen film than McGrath's Emma. For those of you who like to notice details, note the Farris house in London in the opening scene. It sits right next door to the Schlegel's house (Howards End again). Very much worth watching, but no masterpiece, other than perhaps Masterpiece Theatre caliber.",Sense and Sensibility

The period of Enlightenment was a turning point for equality. Austen enlightened us strengthening women's position in this world.Ang Lee is for sure at his best when reflecting the duplex relationships. ""Sense and Sensibility"" is about the women who were meaningless in the eyes of society but who run the world.The Movie tells a story about The family Dashwood. Three girls loose their father and because of the law their father's eldest son is only one who can inherit all their father's possessions. Of course Father (Tom Wilkinson) asks his son to help provide a good life to his new wife and three daughters. Unfortunately son, John is married to this cheap woman Fanny who persuades her husband to give his sisters as little money as possible. John is so gullible and being so henpecked that he gives in.As Fanny and John take over their house The Dashwood girls get help from Mrs.Dashwood's cousin sir John Middleton. Girls have no idea what life has restored for them.The movie concentrates on picturing the conflict between the eldest sister Elinor (Emma Thompson who wan an Academy Award for best adapted script!) and the middle sister miss Marianne (brilliantly vibrant Kate Winslet). Elinor is the reasonable and Marianne is the emotional half. They both have handsome suitors but how does their feelings (or lack of them) affect on their life's.Ang Lee's ""Sense and Sensibility"" is an intriguing and well-acted story. One's again Lee has managed to snatch great performers to demanding roles. Alan Rickman who usually plays the bad guys is sympathetic Colonel Brandon. This movie made him one of my favorite actors in the world. Hugh Grant is clumsy but ""amiable"" rich boy Edward Ferrars who is unfortunately related to Fanny. Grant suits in Edward's shoes because he's a little bit of the stiff side, too. Kate Winslet is marvelous as rebelled Marianne. Emma Thompson was better as a writer but serious Elinor suits her just fine. But the most perking and hilarious characters are sir John's mother-in-law Mrs.Jennings (Elizabeth Briggs) and her daughter Charlotte Palmer (then unknown Imelda Staunton). They were the worst gossip-house in that era. They are fabulous! One thing that is funny is the fact that in Austen's novel Elinor is the age of seventeen. At that time Emma Thompson was in her mid-thirties and still played her! But that's only a little harmless fact. Emma Thompson also met her future-husband-to-be, Greg Wise on the set. Wise plays miss Marianne's biggest object of her affection.Every at least even a tiny little bit of romantic people should watch this superb, timeless classic!",Sense and Sensibility

85,lauraeileen894,"Lush, romantic tale",10,8 January 2007,"1995 was a hell of a year for Jane Austen of all people. 'Tis a rare person indeed who can reach their peak 150 years after their death. In 1995 the BBC released the now legendary miniseries version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" (which launched the yummy Colin Firth to super stardom). Amy Heckerling transformed ""Emma"" into ""Clueless"", which became an overnight teen classic. And Emma Thompson adapted ""Sense and Sensibility"" into a charming, an Oscar-winning screenplay. It also helped a then 20-year-old Kate Winslet receive her first Best Actress Oscar nomination. It was an unlikely hit: most American audiences had only read Jane Austen for required reading in English class, and director Ang Lee couldn't speak a word of English. Yet this handsome adaptation does Jane Austen proud, and shimmers with England's brightest talents. It also has breathtaking cinematography, with the English countryside aglow with golden sunlight. The film opens with tragedy: the wealthy Mr. Dashwood has died, and the law requires that he leave everything to his weak-willed son John (James Fleet), but nothing to his second wife and her daughters. While on his deathbed, Mr. Dashwood begs John to help them since they will be left virtually penniless. John promises, but his horrible, grasping wife Fanny (Harriot Walter), won't hear of it. As a result, Mrs. Dashwood (Gemma Jones) is forced out of her home with her three very different daughters: Elinor (Thompson), a reserved, rational woman who is considered by many a premature spinster; Marianne (Winslet, red hair, baby fat and all), an impetuous, narcissistic romantic; and little Margaret (Emilie Francois), who is still enjoying childhood innocence. Before they leave their estate, the Dashwood women are introduced Edward Farrars (Hugh Grant), Fanny's brother. Thankfully, he's nothing like his sister. Modest, kind, and unassuming, Edward sympathizes with their situation, and attracts Elinor's attention. The two become extremely close, even though Marianne is surprised that Elinor could be in love with someone so mild-mannered (""Can the soul be really be satisfied with such polite affections?"" she asks). Elinor and Edward are obviously in love, but they are both too shy to reveal their feelings, and soon Elinor leaves with her family (much to Fanny's delight, since she disapproves of Edward and Elinor's relationship). Marianne mocks Elinor for her retiring approach to her feelings (""'Esteem' him? 'Like' him? Use those insipid words again and I shall leave this room this instant!"" Marianne taunts), unaware of how much pain Elinor is in. At least they are able to find a new home: a distant relative, Sir John Middleton (Robert Hardy) has offered them a cottage on his estate. Their new neighbor, the meddling ol' biddy Mrs. Jennings (Elizabeth Spriggs) immediately tries to match Marianne with Colonel Christopher Brandon (Alan Rickman), a kindly, soft spoken gentleman with a tragic past. Marianne hates the idea: she finds Colonel Brandon old, stuffy, and boring. Besides, her affections are soon elsewhere... dashing local John Willoughby (Greg Wise) steals Marianne's heart after rescuing her during a rainstorm. They hit it off right away, and their public displays of affection and impulsiveness are not only embarrassing to Elinor, but a sad reminder of what she's lost with Edward. Marianne, on the other hand, is positively euphoric until one day Willoughby abruptly leaves for London with only a vague explanation. Marianne is beside herself with grief. Things only get worse when Elinor is introduced to Mrs. Jennings's recent house guest, simpering, sickly sweet Lucy Steele (Imogen Stubbs). Lucy confides to Elinor that she's been secretly engaged to Edward for five years. Elinor is crushed; Edward never told her about this, and Lucy swears her to secrecy. So Elinor is forced to carry this devastating secret with her, and when she and Marianne go to London and find Willoughby, there is more heartache: Willoughby is now engaged to a wealthy woman, officially ending his romance with a now shattered Marianne. Along the way, Elinor and Marianne are forced to take a look at themselves and realize how wrong they've been not only about the ways of love, but about each other. Elinor realizes that secrecy and reserve don't always contribute to familial trust, and Marianne learns to look beyond her own pain and assumptions about other people to see the bigger picture. They are hard lessons learned, but there is little doubt that the Dashwood sisters will soon reap the rewards. While the women in ""Sense and Sensibility"" aren't as strong and proactive as the women in ""Pride and Prejudice"" or ""Emma"", you root for them nonetheless. The entire cast is pitch perfect. Any other actress would have made Elinor uptight and uninteresting, but Thompson injects the character with warmth, humor, and steely inner strength. She's really the glue that holds her family together. Winslet is a marvel, making the dreamy and self-centered Marianne sympathetic and interesting, with palpable desires and passions. Rickman, who usually plays the type of roles George Sanders would have played 50 or 60 years ago, is sexy and appealing in the type of romantic role that he is rarely given. I also adored Stubbs as Lucy. With her fluttery eyes and perpetual smile, she seems to relish playing an utterly insufferable phony who knows Elinor is in love with Edward and uses this fact to rub it in Elinor's face.One of the most delightful surprises is Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer, Mrs. Jennings's son-in-law. He's caustic, snappish and cynical; hmmm, sounds like a certain TV doctor he's played in recent yearsThis heartwarming (and sometimes heartbreaking), visually beautiful film is a must for every fan of Emma Thompson, Jane Austen, or old-fashioned romances. ""Sense and Sensibility"" is a winner.",Sense and Sensibility
86,Rozinda,Great version of this,10,14 May 2008,"Simply perfect version of this fine Jane Austen story. How could it be bettered? This was never my favourite Austen - I like P&P and Emma better, but it is No.3. Like others in these comments, Hugh Grant was a major factor for me in enjoying this version even though all the other actors are also excellent and I didn't watch on Hugh's account. When I saw Hugh for the first time (I think) in 4 Weddings I wasn't all that enthused because I didn't find his character in the story very interesting, nor the character's girlfriend. But every other time I've seen him in film he's been so very good.I've seen at least one other version of this story but I don't remember much of it. It wasn't as good as this one.",Sense and Sensibility
87,Paddy-49,This is a story to be told not social commentary - and a story which in the hands of this top class team is utterly believable. I think Miss Austen would approve.,8,30 August 2021,"The pace of the movie is exceptional, it never drags and always holds your attention. Jane Austen's novel is flawless and the film matches it. Emma Thompson understood Austen perfectly though she chooses, successfully I think, mainly to write in modern English. She wrote Edward with Hugh Grant in mind and there are some close to Richard Curtis moments ! Austen is a genre all of her own, there really is nobody like her. The characters and the story may be well over two hundred years ago but the behaviour, good and bad, is timeless. The social class hierarchy is acutely observed and gently mocked. As is the dilemma of the choice between love and wealth.We see a society in which women have few rights and yet it is the women who call most of the tunes. Both Colonel Brandon and Edward Ferris are decent, almost diffident and Austen rewards their gentility - they both get the girl in the End! The cinematography is good - nothing is garish and the English countryside is gentle and pastoral to match the story. To achieve the level of realism he did the Director must have had a tight control - there are few if any false moves. The editing is effortless and the viewer is led by the hand through the sequential telling of the story. No confusing flashbacks. And no pseudo documentary either. This is a story to be told not social commentary - and a story which in the hands of this top class team is utterly believable. I think Miss Austen would approve.",Sense and Sensibility
88,Watcher-37,Marvelous filmmaking,10,6 September 1999,"Emma Thompson,Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman headline a magnificent cast in this adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Thompson and Winslet are the two oldest Dashwood sisters, who along with their mother and younger sister are forced to move to a small cottage from their large home when their mother's husband dies and the inheritance passes from the father to the dishrag of a son and his shrewish wife. Along the way Thompson falls in love with Grant, but soon learns that he is secretly engaged to another and fears she will never find a love. Winslet is the impetuous one who throws herself at a silver tongued Willoughby, a ne'er do well dependent on his aunt. She ignores Rickman's character who is at first smitten and then very much in love with her. The movie has a happy ending, but unlike a lot of movies, it is not a sappy one. Everything works out for a well thought out and executed reason. The script by Thompson and a co-writer was great and deserving of the Oscar win. The film was magic and the look was nailed to perfection. Can't ask for more than that.",Sense and Sensibility
89,IridescentTranquility,A fantastic film with an even better soundtrack,8,15 January 2005,"As with Pride and Prejudice, I have owned a copy of this film for about eight years, and I almost find it impossible to think that anyone could criticise it. A lot of people criticise the decision to cast Emma Thompson, then thirty-six, as nineteen year old Elinor, but I feel that the fact that she is clearly older than her character should be adds to Elinor's role as the logical, practical woman surrounded by a sister who wants to be a pirate, a fully-paid up romantic (Kate Winslet as Marianne) and a mother who doesn't appreciate the starkness of their newly-impoverished status quite as fully as she does. I always feel that - in this version at least - Elinor is forced to act older than she is to compensate for all this idealism. Another outstanding feature of the film is the quality of acting provided by the supporting cast. Imelda Staunton begins as an unbearably screechy woman and yet by the end of the film we see that she is more than capable of appreciating the gravity of a serious situation. Hugh Laurie as her husband Mr. Palmer is priceless (watch out for a scene where he is reading a copy of the newspaper The Porcupine). Greg Wise as Willoughby is incredibly convincing as the embodiment of Marianne's romantic hero who turns out to have a less than spotless reputation. Alan Rickman, who truly loves Marianne, is quite restrained enough and it soon becomes clear why he is so brooding.Personally I don't have a problem with the fact that it might not be totally faithful to eighteenth century life in terms of hygiene and cleanliness because - to me - that isn't what Jane Austen is about. It is supposed to be genteel and this film is. She didn't write to depict realism, she wrote to satirise and observe the society she lived in, and this is something the film never fails to do. If the girls remained as rich as they had in the beginning, I don't think we would have cared for them quite as much as we do. It is very much a handicap to their eligibility.On a final note, one really strong point is the costumes. They all seem to embody the period so well, and very accurately, too. Mrs. Jennings (being around sixty) wears clothes from an earlier period, and Mrs. Dashwood's clothes are not quite up to the minute, which adds another touch of realism to this outstanding film.",Sense and Sensibility

I loved this movie the first time I saw it, and it just got better the second time.  Even after watching it about 6 times, I still love it!  The cast brings the movie to life, and I love the range of qualities...from humorous to dramatically and intensely sad to brilliant and joyful!  The music is beautiful and so is the photography and all the scenery.

As well the young actress who portrayed Margaret Dashwood, offered some nice comedy relief and smiles.And he small, role played by Hugh Laurie is so fun. And he comes to the rescue when Marianne falls ill. Such a bizarre thing to see they were still 'bleeding' patients. How very bizarre against modern medicine.There are so many unsung heroes in this movie, not the least of which is Robert Hardy, Alan Rickman, and even the actor who portrays Willouby. That actor later married Emma Thompson, so he must be the right sort.Watch it for the lovely, largely accurate portrayal of the times.

Yet each year when we do this film in class, about 80 percent end up loving it and that includes the guys. It's wonderful to watch them respond to the characters and get into a film that is so ""talky"" when they have been used to high action. To hear the girls call Willoughby a jerk and applaud Brandon at the end is great, but to listen to the boys comment on the behavior of the various characters is even better. How they respond to a society so filled with strict manners and codes of behavior also makes this film worthwhile and it generates much discussion about the importance of money in life; well, even Thompson in the commentary said the film is about money, who has it and who does not. I love showing this film to my students; after the groans when I start it on the first day, it's wonderful to hear their comments on day five when we finish. As one senior male said this year, ""I wouldn't have rented this or wanted to see it, but now that I have, I admit it was pretty good, so I'm glad you showed it."" This is why they are classics, kiddies.",Sense and Sensibility
95,markmuhl,My dearest,10,11 January 2016,"What a wonderful period movie. How could I miss it for 20 years.To me personally the love story between Elinor and Edward (sense) is by far more touching than Marianne's with Willoughby or Colonel Brandon (sensibility). Elinor's emotional outburst in the end is so perfectly plaid by Emma Thompson that one could not think of the tiniest little bit that would make it any better.I also want to stress how wonderfully some of the underparts fit into the movie and how much they add to it by embedding the main story lines into a lively environment. Having not read the original novel I cannot tell how this is to be owed to Jane Austen, Emma Thompson or to both of them.I especially like Margaret (Emily Francois). In her natural and still quite unspoilt behaviour the youngest sister is building a bridge to us people of modern society and does make us feel more connected to the otherwise so far away appearing world of yesterday (although 200 years do not seem to be such great a distance). Apart from that, the acting performance of Francois is quite impressive. Almost every scene with her is bewitching like the one where she is so disappointed that Edward did not bring the atlas himself or the scene where she is stressing out that she likes Mrs. Jennings because Mrs. Jennings talks about things unlike her own family.Mrs. Jennings (Elizabeth Spriggs) herself is another example of a marvelous character. So annoying she seems to be in the beginning she turns out to be a really warmhearted and consoling person. I especially like her comments on her son-in-law Mr. Palmer like: ""Mr. Palmer is so droll. He's always out of humour"".Also her other son-in law Sir John Middleton (Robert Hardy) gives a very interesting character who cares only partly for the strict rules of behavior of his social class. Being a rather simple and straightforward ""male"" character he quite often does not really understand all the concerns of his female fellow people. This also may sound familiar to some of us. His comment on Elinors's favorite key in F major and his truthful joy about his own somewhat embarrassing joke alongside with Mrs. Jennings always make me laugh when seeing this scene.I also cannot share the opinion that Emma Thompson then was too old for Elinor's character. Her character straits, that is being sensible and guarded, are much more credible in someone who has already overcome the emotional confusions of the youth. Apart from that it is hardly imaginable that anyone else could have played Elinor's part better than Emma Thompson.To me this film offers so much: big emotions for the great romantics without being kitschy, a subtle sense of humour and deep insights into a past society. Thank you for this wonderful work.",Sense and Sensibility
96,ashi-lance,Sense and Sensibility '95,8,27 August 2013,"Before The tigers crouched and the dragons hid, before the boys of mountain Brokeback, there was Ang Lee's masterpiece Sense and Sensibility, that invites everyone's attention for. It is probably the best adaptation of Sense and Sensibility (Jane Austen's novel) you will ever see, with stellar performances by Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson, all who give award worthy emotions throughout the film. I found ""Sense and Sensibilty"" to be one of the most charming movies with a warm feeling and is very welcoming. The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990's, many of Jane Austen's huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were good, but Sense and Sensibility really stood out and was the best as per my perception. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay. Sense and Sensibility stars Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet as sisters, who are left poor after their rich father dies and leaves all his wealth to his son from his earlier marriage, making both the sisters poison for their future husbands because of the lack of their ability to offer dowry. This doesn't stop them from love, however, which causes many problems and heart breaks. Thompson is the 'sensible one as She is reserved and nurturing, while Winslet is the overtly passionate and artistic one. Their acting, as well as the excellent supporting cast's performances are wonderful and believable. However, the real star of the movie is the direction The incredible landscapes and the beautiful cinematography is a character in itself. In one particular scene, Winslet is taking a walk after hearing some unfortunate news, and the very atmosphere around her envelops her and makes the scene so much more fulfilling. Ang Lee is a brilliant artist, and has shown such amazing versatility with his portfolio of work that anytime I hear that a new Lee film is going to be released, I go crazy.MY RATING: 8/10",Sense and Sensibility

101,marspeach,"Overrated, but enjoyable",7,5 July 2006,"Sense and Sensibility may be my least favorite Jane Austen novel, but that doesn't mean I don't love it. This movie was a pretty good adaptation, but I think it is overrated. Maybe it is to do with the fact that I think the book is slightly weak in comparison to her others. Or maybe it's just the film. I liked some of the changes Emma Thompson made, such as enhancing the character of Margaret, showing Elinor and Edward falling in love, etc. Most of the actors were great, including Alan Rickman (though his character was definitely made sexier than his boring book self), Greg Wise, and Kate Winslet. But I didn't really like Emma as Elinor. At 36, she was way too old for the role (Elinor is only 19) and while I know that can be seen to enhance her ""sense"" and show how she is mature and everything, I think it took away from the character. For Elinor to have those qualities at such a young age, really says more about her, I think. I also didn't like how she wrote that it was illegal for women to inherit in her screenplay. Why did she have to deliberately give the audience the wrong idea about inheritance in those days? Hugh Grant's Edward is also changed from the book, stuttering all the time. In spite of this, I think he is a more sympathetic character than he was in the book. I was not a fan of his at all. However, this is still a good adaptation and I don't want to discourage anyone from seeing it.",Sense and Sensibility

104,cathyyoung1,Good -- not great,7,16 May 2000,"""Sense and Sensibility"" was probably the best of the recent Jane Austen adaptations (except, perhaps, for the TV miniseries ""Pride and Prejudice""). The screenplay was good and reasonably close to the novel, preserving both its humor and its drama while moving at a brisk pace.  The cast was mostly excellent.  True, Hugh Grant was a bit irritating, doing an 18th (or early 19th) century version of the his ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" character, but Emma Thompson was superb (even if she was a bit old for the part -- Elinor is supposed to be about 19!!!) and Kate Winslet was very good. Alan Rickman brought a quiet intensity to the role of Colonel Brandon.  Good work, too, by the supporting cast, especially Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings, Imogen Stubbs as the conniving Lucy Edwards, and Imelda Staunton as the ditzy but good-natured Charlotte Palmer.***WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD****My one complaint (besides Hugh Grant's lackluster performance) is about several ways in which the screenplay departed from the novel.  Now, I don't expect a screen version to be faithful to the book in everything; I know that sometimes, what works on the printed page does not work onscreen, and vice versa.  I didn't mind the way the screenwriters expanded the character of Margaret, the youngest sister, and I liked what they did in the scene where Colonel Brandon carries Marianne home.  However, some of the alterations were unnecessary and unsatisfying.1.  Incomprehensibly, one of the book's most dramatic scenes -- Willoughby's confrontation with Elinor when he comes to visit the Dashwoods during Marianne's illness -- disappears from the movie.  (In view of this, it's not quite clear how Elinor knows that Willoughby will always regret having jilted Marianne.  Is she THAT perceptive?)2.  In the book, Lucy's engagement to Edward is revealed to his sister Fanny by Lucy's scatterbrained sister (a character who was dropped from the film, and who could have been easily introduced in a brief scene).  In the film, it is Lucy herself who tells Fanny about the engagement.  It makes for a slapstick scene that seems rather out of place in the movie (Fanny twisting Lucy's nose).  However, it makes little sense... Lucy was far too calculating to make such a slip!3.  In the film, when Edward reveals that he is not married to Lucy but his brother is, Elinor has a violent fit of sobbing right then and there in the parlor, in front of her mother, her sisters, and Edward.  Elinor would have NEVER permitted herself such a public display of emotion!  In the book, she can barely control herself until she gets back to her room and THEN bursts into tears.  I think the filmmakers changed this to make Elinor more appealing to modern audiences, reared in a culture that values emotional expressiveness and doesn't understand or appreciate reticence.",Sense and Sensibility

106,louiepatti,English Romance At Its Finest,10,6 July 2005,"Jane Austin is not to everyone's taste; her wordiness tends to drain the life from her characters. Fortunately, Emma Thompson realized this and corrected it when she adapted the novel into her award-winning screenplay. Miss Thompson took essential elements from the romantic tale, enhancing both humor and drama, and the result is undeniably both Jane Austen and immensely appealing.This movie is an English period romance, set in pre-Victorian times. It's hard for modern people to imagine, but life back then was more structured; every situation was carefully controlled by social codes and strict manners. It was a stifling time, particularly for women, who had virtually no legal rights and opportunities beyond marriage or a religious life. As the story begins, a man is dying, and he's fearful, not of his death but for his surviving second wife and three daughters. He pleads with his son John Dashwood, the heir to his vast fortunes, to care for John's stepmother and half-sisters. John agrees to help them, but is soon talked out of it by his selfish wife Fanny, and the poor females find themselves virtually broke and strangers in their own home. To complicate matters, Elinor has met her soulmate in Fanny's younger gentle brother Edward Ferrars, but Fanny makes it clear to Elinor that a match between them would never do. The atmosphere in the Dashwood mansion is uncomfortable, and the mother and her daughters want to flee, but can't afford to move. Help comes in the form of a kindly relative, a nobleman named Sir John Middleton who offers them a cottage on his estate, rent-free. Mrs. Dashwood takes her three daughters---sensible Elinor, passionate Marianne and young Margaret---to stay there. Their relative insists they join him and his nosy mother-in-law Mrs. Jennings frequently for dinner. The old woman is a busybody and an incurable matchmaker, and is bound to see one of the older two Dashwood girls married to Colonel Brandon, the most eligible bachelor in the county. When Brandon first sees Marianne playing a melancholy melody on a pianoforte and singing like an angel, he is incurably smitten. He is, however, also considerably older than Marianne and realizes that she wouldn't see him as a suitor. When Marianne hurts her ankle and is rescued by Willoughby, the dashing young man steals her heart and though Brandon detests the charming rogue, he steps aside so that Marianne might be happy.Twists ensue, for the road to love is seldom smooth. Elinor discovers that Edward is engaged to a selfish young woman named Lucy Steele, which Lucy tells her in confidence and then tosses in Elinor's face at every opportunity. When the women expect Willoughby to propose to Marianne, he instead severs his relationship with her and hurries away to London. When Mrs. Jennings's daughter Charlotte and her husband Mr. Palmer visit, they offer to take Elinor and Marianne to London. Elinor is apprehensive, for she's afraid to see Edward, and Marianne is thrilled, for she can't wait to see Willoughby. When they go there, however, neither encounter is anything like the young women expected, and Marianne ends up suffering an emotional breakdown. Throughout it all, Brandon is on hand to help Marianne in his unobtrusive way, and he goes with Elinor and Marianne to stay with Charlotte and her husband. Heartsick over Willoughby, Marianne takes note when Charlotte mentions that his estate Combe Magna is visible from a hill on their property. At the first opportunity, Marianne slips away to find the crest overlooking Combe Magna, which is over five miles from their house. A cold rain falls and she is drenched and shivering when Brandon finds her and carries her all the way back. Weakened by lack of eating and sleeping from her emotional distress, Marianne becomes gravely ill, compelling the Palmers to leave with their infant son and his nurse. Brandon is going insane with fear for her and begs Elinor to give him something to do that would help her younger sister. Elinor dispatches him to fetch their mother, and they return as Marianne is declared to be out of danger. It is apparent that Marianne has learned the difference between romance and real love. They go home to their cottage and the colonel then begins a gentle courtship of her. Elinor faces her own pain when their manservant Thomas mentions that he met Mrs. Ferrars, the former Lucy Steele, when he was in town. She goes to her room and holds the handkerchief Edward had given her long ago, when he had stayed at the Dashwood estate and they had first become acquainted. However, what Thomas told her turns out to be incomplete. Lucy is indeed married to one of the Ferrar brothers, but it is the one who is most like her. In the end, the young Dashwood ladies end up happily married to men who are best for them.Everything in this movie works, from the costumes to the cinematography, but it's the acting that really illuminates the screen. Emma Thompson is wonderful as the calm elder sister who patiently endures so much for the sake of others; Kate Winslett is perfect for the mercurial Marianne who wears her feelings on her sleeve. Hugh Grant is endearing as the shy Edward. Alan Rickman, playing against his usual type of role, is awesome as the unselfish Brandon; though outwardly aloof, Rickman conveys the hidden passionate side of his character with subtle brilliance. We also loved Hugh Laurie as the sarcastic Mr. Palmer, who hides his kindly nature under muttered comments to his flighty wife. Another delightful aspect of this film is the haunting and evocative musical score.Sense and Sensibility is a fine example of English period romance. It won't appeal to action movie fans, and requires a serious attention span. Well-written and professionally acted, this film is well worth viewing; it's enjoyable and lovely.",Sense and Sensibility

It would be remiss of me not to mention Patrick Doyle's score, the musical embodiment of all that is good and compassionate. The story is also wonderful, of course (btw, my favorite Austen work.) We come to love these characters and feel sad for them--except Willoughby. I believe Austen wants us to come away mad at him for not knowing better than to almost ruin Marianne's life! To me, Marianne is the heart of the story. She is very young and makes mistakes, but we're supposed to sympathize with her: as they say, you live and you learn, and Marianne does so. Kate Winslet helps her be so endearing. And you can never go wrong with Emma Thompson or Alan Rickman. He and Winslet are the perfect match. This is the best love story on film.

111,francescof86,"""Sense And Sensibility""",8,31 December 2012,"""Sense And Sensibility"" is a film by the master Ang Lee from the novel by Jane Austen. The script is written by the original point of view of Emma Thompson who also plays Elinor Dashwood. The film centers about two sisters who are completely different. The elder,Elinor(Emma Thompson) is wise ,prudent,practical and taciturn in regards of her own feelings. The younger,Marianne(Kate Winslet)is passionate,fantasist absolutist in her ideas and she can't absolutely hide her emotions.After Mr.Dashwood death their marriage opportunities are definitely damaged. The point is how could Elinor and Marianne overgrow their own lack of balance in their attitude towards love? The direction is spectacular and poetical and Ang Lee is able to film really overwhelming sequences. It has to be said that sometimes costume dramas are only a chance to built extraordinary film sets with nothing particularly original interpretations but ""Sense and Sensibility"" is quite the opposite. It is faithful to the original source but it is nonetheless an important showcase of a not ordinary direction and truly inspired and brilliant performances. The acting is absolutely superb in every way. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet are truly in command of their characters and express every single beat with great accomplishment. The supporting actors are wonderful as well. This coupled with a really lovely soundtrack makes this film particularly beautiful. My vote is 8/10.",Sense and Sensibility
112,Filmtribute,Splendid Tribute to British Talent,9,14 February 2002,"This deft adaptation proves itself as a labour of love for Emma Thompson whose screenplay deservedly earned her an Academy award after spending three years perfecting it.  This was in much the same way that Jane Austen polished her six major novels, with `Sense and Sensibility', her first, receiving two rewrites over the fourteen years before its publication in 1811.  The humorous witticisms of Austen are cleverly drawn out around the central theme of the need for the women of her circle to find a good husband to provide for them, at a time when the law discriminatingly prevented them from inheriting and they had no option of pursuing a career.
Emma Thompson, radiantly mature for the 19 year old role of Elinor Dashwood, and usually given to very passionate performances straight from her soul, turns in one of her finest to join `Remains of the Day' and `Howards End' with her touching delineation of repressed emotions hiding a broken heart. In a rare departure from her character's nature, Elinor, who is absurdly considered an old maid by society's conventions, eventually breaks down in a fit of choking sobbing that Emma Thompson skillfully prevents from becoming overly hysterical.  Kate Winslet (`Heavenly Creatures' & `Titanic') and newcomer Emilie Francois are superb as the younger sisters (Marianne and Margaret) full of aerial sensibilities and romantic notions, to counteract Elinor's grounded sense. The story develops to encourage its heroines that some balance between these two diametrically opposing views is desirable, in order for both Elinor and Marianne to find happiness in an intimate relationship.  An unusually subdued non-villainous Alan Rickman (`Die Hard' & `Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves') plays the middle-aged and almost confirmed bachelor, Colonel Brandon, with a permanently pained expression who is surprisingly besotted with Marianne, adroitly illustrating the mysteries of the human heart, just as Elinor's affection for the awkward Edward does (Hugh Grant in a typical charmingly' stammering role prior to `Bridget Jones' Diary').  The ending is of course neatly if rather suddenly wrapped up in a flurry of weddings, and not before we have been led a merry dance along the path of true love.This movie also serves as a fitting tribute to some of the finest British actors of today.  Harriet Walter (a gifted stage actress with several radio and TV credits, including Harriet Vane in the 1987 dramatisations of Dorothy L. Sayers' `Lord Peter Wimsey', and lately appearances in films such as `Onegin', who deserves more higher profile roles) displays the heartless selfishness of Fanny Dashwood to perfection as she seeks to disinherit the three daughters totally by persuading her feckless husband (James Fleet) to betray his promise to his father.  Most notable among other members of the cast are Robert Hardy as the jocular cousin Sir John Middleton who provides accommodation for the second Mrs Dashwood (Gemma Jones), equally as impetuous as her daughters; Elizabeth Spriggs as the well meaning busy body, Mrs Jennings; an acerbic Hugh Laurie as the long suffering husband to a garrulous Imelda Staunton; and Imogen Stubbs as the flighty friend Lucy Steele who foolishly declares her secret to an enraged Fanny Dashwood.Ang Lee's pre `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' direction with its cold and hostile depiction of the London society ball, where Marianne is openly rejected by her erstwhile dashingly roughish Willoughby (Greg Wise), is a remarkable study in English class snobbery.  His Taiwanese background with its parallels to early 19th century English societal strictures has obviously given him a great insight for this film.  The cinematography by Michael Coulter (from those other successful British exports to the USA, `Four Weddings and a Funeral' & `Notting Hill') gives us well-lit grandiose interiors and the Southern English countryside at its best, even in the rain. The only possible faults with this film lie in the source material where people felicitously disappear and reappear at whim without credible explanation, which is due to Austen's inexperience as a first time novelist, and the grand houses are, apparently, too sumptuous for the various families' social standing.  The fabulous three storeyed `cottage' on Sir John's Devonshire estate, which must be worth at least £400,000, is seemingly inappropriate for the Dashwoods' straitened means. 
Criticisms are often pointlessly levelled at Jane Austen for concentrating on her own immediate gentrified set, but this is the world she knew well, being the daughter of a country parson, and she has a renowned talent for detailing its mannerisms and customs that still make for a fascinating social history and insight into human nature.  The same could be said of Edith Wharton writing about wealthy New Englanders at the end of the 19th century, but it doesn't detract from her obvious skill either.  For those wanting that century's social horrors and evils then Charles Dickens and George Eliot are better suited, and if you expect Austen to be modernised to appeal to a wider band of viewer then look to Amy Heckerling's clever `Clueless' (1995) as an American high school teenage spin on `Emma'.Like many movies, `Sense and Sensibility' was up against competition from similar genre films developed and released at the same time, with both 1995 and 1996 being Austen's revival years.  1995 also saw a low-key but beautifully observed British production of `Persuasion' with the talents of Amanda Root as the doe-eyed heroine Anne Elliot, Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth, and Sophie Thompson, Emma's younger sister, who also appeared with their mother, Phyllidia Law, in the following year's more commercial of the two traditional adaptations of `Emma' (with Gwyneth Paltrow, Toni Collette and Ewan McGregor).   The BBC's run away hit version of `Pride and Prejudice' with its truly smouldering romance between Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle in the lead roles of Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett was also released in 1995.  For Jane Austen fans rather than dyed-in-the-wool purists, all of these film and TV productions have something to recommend them and I welcomed the various different styles whether being a faithful rendition or an imaginative interpretation.",Sense and Sensibility

I think that also means that I would never go crazy over a film like this. Emma Thompson, who also adapted the novel to screen, plays Elinor Dashwood, the oldest sister and she represents ""sense."" Kate Winslet plays Marianne Dashwood, the younger sister who represents ""sensibility."" Their father has died and he must leave his fortune to the son of his first marriage. This causes complications between the family and the daughters' hopes of marriage.Elinor begins a relationship with a rich man, Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant). They are then separated because of Edward's wealthy family. Marianne, on the other hand, is in love with John Willoughby (Greg Wise). At the same time, wealthy Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman) has eyes for Marianne, but she thinks Brandon is too old for her and prefers Willoughby instead.The film sometimes has a few heartwarming and humorous moments, but overall I was quite bored of the film. The acting is pretty standard and the performances still deliver. Winslet's Marianne is who really shines in the cast. Director Ang Lee shows his versatility in her occupation perfectly  the guy can make a good Taiwanese film, a British costume drama, a film based on American suburbia, a Chinese martial arts film, an action film and even a gay cowboy movie. The film is simply told, maybe being a little too long (never read the book) and might be great for fans, but I actually got bored while watching the film.

I have never seen Emma Thompson in a bad movie. I love her acting. Hugh Grant as Edward Ferrars is the perfect gentleman. I would suggest you men take notes, as you should with Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, who shows us how to win the girl. Elizabeth Spriggs is the perfect matchmaker. Hugh Laurie's supporting roll as the cross husband to a wife no one would want to be married to cannot be outdone. Any audience with a heart will empathize with the entire cast's wonderful performance.The plot is about love. Shakespeare himself couldn't have done a better job. The only difference being the tragedy in Sense and Sensibility is ongoing and it has a happy ending.The goofs are pretty to the point, but there is a big goof in the plot that isn't mentioned.

I can't get through them, they're so boring compared to this one. Emma Thompson's adaptation to the screen is faithful enough, but not so faithful so as to induce yawn.

He (unsurprisingly) scoffed the first few times and walked away. He must've found himself without anything to do one time and stayed. He actually started paying attention and enjoying it.

121,blowfly13,Best Jane Austen movie of all time,10,25 August 2007,"Emma Thompson is an amazing women. Perhaps because she isn't a writer, she was able to take a Jane Austen novel, catch both the spirit and the dialog, and let it speak for itself. Unlike Hollywood 'writers,' she as able to see and appreciate a work of art, and transform it into a truly awesome movie. There was not one distortion of Austen's work in the entire movie; with most Austen movies, I cringe the entire time. The characters were perfectly cast, the costumes were perfect, and the directing was masterful. The entire movie remained true to Austen and her time - there were none of those jolting ""updates"" to this century that so many other Austen adapters seem to feel so compelled to make. Thompson perhaps seemed a bit old for her part, but still she played it perfectly. Hugh Grant added a bit more charm to Edward's character than is present in the book, but to good effect, and in a few scenes (like the one where he goes to visit Eleanor and runs into Lucy as well) he is downright hilarious. Hugh Laurie was not able to play Mr. Palmer with the right attitude to make him as funny as he is in the book, but that is a very minor complaint. One small disappointment was the omission of Willoughby's confession to Eleanor at the end of the book. Aside from these very very small problems, the movie is one of my favorites, and no other adaptation of an Austen novel comes anywhere close (and I begin to think, ever will). I really can't say enough good about it. Even the music was incredible. I was sad to see Thompson deferring to Keira Knightley at some awards show. Based on her performance in the recent horror P&P, Knightley isn't fit to dust Thompson's boots.",Sense and Sensibility

124,o_levina,Beautiful and intelligent adaptation of the true English classic,10,15 November 2001,"The film does credit to Jane Austen's novel. The screenplay is very well-written, settings are wonderful and acting is fine. Sense And Sensibility is the romance at its best  complex, unhurried, intriguing and moving story, set in 19th century's British country. I usually find one weak point in Austen's works  that is a lack of direct speech especially in key moments. The movie solved the problem. There are just enough dialogues and plenty other things to enjoy  amusing details and minor characters, picturesque nature, elegant houses and two beautiful heroines with dramatic love-stories. Emma Thompson is certainly the star of the film. I've always considered her as an outstanding actress, but never knew as screenwriter. She made a really interesting and heart-warming adaptation of the novel as well as created convincing image of Elinor Dashwood, the heroine with sense'.  As Mr. Dashwood dies, his son from the first marriage inherits everything, and the second wife with three daughters gets no house and almost no income. They are hospitably accepted by their relative Sir John Middletone and occupy small modest cottage. The elder daughter Elinor is forced to become the head of the family for her mother and sister Marianne are too sentimental and unpractical, and Margaret is a child. Elinor manages housekeeping concealing in her heart affection to Edward Ferras, a bashful young man who seemed to be in love with her but never confessed it and went away to make his career according to the wish of his family. Dashwoods family gets acquainted with new neighbors and Marianne finds at once two suitors  respectable colonel Brandon and dashing Mr. Willoughby. The exalted girl madly falls in love with that romantically figure of Willoughby. Young man shows clearly that he likes her however he turns out to be a wicked person and deserts her to marry on money, breaking Marianne's heart. Poor Elinor meanwhile discovers that Edward has been secretly engaged for five years to Lucy Steel. However, she hides her pain and becomes absorbed in her sister's illness. The end, of course, is happy. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslete are both superb in their parts, making viewers share anxiety, sufferings and joys of the characters. Hugh Grant is good as Edward, pleasant, quiet and affectionate; sometimes he exaggerates his shyness and awkwardness, coming to comedy, but he is still nice. Allan Rickman was a right choice for serious and noble colonel, perfect gentleman with troubled past who finds new love. To my taste, Greg Wise as Willoughby is not a type of man to die from love for, Rickman is better in every sense but tastes differ. And he acts very well. Emilie Fransois shines as young Margaret; she is too daring for a well-bred girl of Austen's time, but it works in a film. Supporting cast is also excellent, some unforgettable performances add much to the atmosphere of the movie. Robert Hardy's Sir Middletone and Elizabeth Spriggs' Mrs. Jennings are masterpieces. Imogen Stubbs is excellent Lucy Steel, light-headed but mercantile and insincere girl. Hugh Laurie and Imelda Staunton amuse us a comic pair of Palmers. The direction, cinematography, costume design, etc  all is splendid. It's a pity that this brilliant movie received only one Oscar.

It also garnered six further Oscar nominations, including Best Actress (Thompson) and Best Supporting Actress (Kate Winslet – although this is a mystery to me, as she was certainly part of the main cast, and not a supporting actor. I imagine that Thompson and Winslet may have been put into different categories so that they did not end up competing with each other).The basic storyline revolves around Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, two sisters who, after the death of their father, are forced to move with their mother and young sister Margaret, to a cottage. The two very close but very different sisters fall in love with two very different men, but the path of love does not always run smoothly.As well as Thompson and Winslet (who at the time was not the huge star that she subsequently became), the cast features an impressive array of actors – Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, Hugh Grant as Edward Ferrars – to whom Elinor finds herself attracted – Hugh Laurie, Imogen Stubbs and Imelda Staunton, amongst others.There are some differences to the book, but I think the film is certainly in keeping with the spirit of Jane Austen's novel. The story is sensitively told, and there are some moving moments, as well as some comical ones. It is also beautifully shot, with some gorgeous scenery, and a lovely soundtrack.As expected from such a stellar cast, the acting is top notch, especially from Emma Thompson, Hugh Laurie and Alan Rickman.

132,mosmanic,Sense with Sensitivity,9,6 August 2000,"This is a feast of British film-making at its best. Jane Austen's novels are gems of societal observation, and although limited to the goings-on among the privileged classes of the time (early 19th century) they capture the essence and texture of their lives beautifully.In adapting works for the screen and a modern audience it must be tempting for the screenwriter and director to try to appeal to current sensibilities in the interests of the box office, but I think to do so with Austen's work would be to miss the point.The considered politeness, emotional restraint and carefully embroidered speech must seem quaint indeed to those brought up on a diet of murder, destruction and tawdry social mores, but portraying those qualities faithfully is surely the whole reason for making a film like this.Emma Thompson's screenplay is therefore a tour de force in retaining the feel and relevance of the piece and presenting us with a charming movie with large-as-life characters you can care about, taking only a few liberties to enhance playability and dramatic effect.The awkward balance between love, honour and financial pragmatism that affected both sexes at the time is finely drawn and acted so that we can empathise with the plight of the major characters and recognise the echoes of their dilemmas today.A first class cast, beautiful authentic surroundings and excellent cinematography demonstrate once again that for period-pieces the Poms are supreme.

138,darkthirty,Buffoonery and Farce,2,20 August 2011,"I will never understand the adoration this farcical, buffoonish film receives. The worst thing about it is the screenplay, for which it won, somehow, an Oscar - but then, so did Dances with Wolves a few years earlier. The script revels in sentimental, which is not very Austen-like at all. The next worst thing is the direction, which is a kind of intrusive, perpendicular thing, always at odds with the context, seeming to struggle with Austen's nuanced and yet unadorned and direct message. It's all adornment in the end, and watching the actors plough through their lines is disconcerting, knowing so many of them are in fact decent actors. I do blame Emma Thompson, who is too old for the part and whose feeble attempts at conveying subtle and nuanced feelings end up looking mildly farcical themselves, especially the scenes where Elinor is at Marianne's bedside. They are frankly unwatchable. I think this perhaps the worst adaptation of Austen in modern times, and yet how highly it is praised. One might as well have put big red noses and huge clown feet on the actors - all that kerfuffle going on on screen and hiding an empty vision. Compared to the wonderful 2008 TV film, this 1995 film is mere buffoonery.",Sense and Sensibility
139,Eowyn1967,Not faithful to the novel and most characters not well portrayed,5,27 September 2004,"I find this adaptation of Jane Austen's novel disappointing. It isn't at all as faithful as the BBC Miniseries Pride and Prejudice. Elinor is only a 19-yr old girl in the novel, so Emily Thompson is far too old to portray her and Hugh Grant makes a really silly Edward (and what silly 20th century jokes are added that weren't in the book at all). Elinor's mother in the book is as romantic and emotional as Marianne whereas the film portrays her as much stricter. I find only Marianne, Sir John and his mother in law well portrayed. Besides, though the Dashwoods were in reduced circumstances, Jane Austen never portrayed them as poor as the film makes them. It's downright silly to have them say they won't buy sugar or beef, whereas the novel shows them entertaining Sir John Dashwood and his family on a regular basis or being so called in their cottage (that doesn't look at all like a cottage) when they invited Edward or Willoughby to stay with them. The only good points are straight from the novel (the witty dialogues), but all that's been added (and subtracted) is of poor quality. Edward and Elinor's romance is not credible, and (but I did not find it credible in the novel either), the male characters don't seem real and the love affairs, except for Marianne and Willoughby's, appear contrived.",Sense and Sensibility

Moreover, no other adaptation of a classic English novel has given me such an enormous pleasure and a nostalgic sense of the romanticized centuries gone.The greatest merit of the film is the engaging and masterful performances of the main cast (Emma Tompson, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman) as well as those of the supporting actors (Harriet Walter, Imelda Staunton, Hugh Laurie, etc.). The development of protagonists' personalities and relations between them is so well unraveled in the film, although some characters such as Eleonor or Brandon may seem to be too idealistic. But so are they in the romantic novels with happy endings.The flawless cinematography and excellent settings fuse together to produce a delightful view. And all of this is hold together in sweet unison by skillful directing of Ang Lee. The harmonious intertwining of all film elements is striking, leaving you enchanted with the bucolic life and ways of the English gentry in the 19th century.A delicious treat for the lovers of the classic English novel!",Sense and Sensibility

I think this is one of the best films that have been set in the early 19th Century. The film focuses on two sisters, their loves and loses, their romances I think its a perfect depiction of English Society within the time period concerned.Emma Thompson's script is almost as good as Jane Austin's original book. Kate Winslet plays a perfect part, dreaming of her beloved Willoughby. Emma Thompson also plays a wonderful part of the older sister. Greg Wise is just amazing in his role of Willoughby. Allan Rickman plays Brandon.The art, the music, the whole image of the film wonderful. If you haven't seen it yet - what are you waiting for thoroughly entertaining.",Sense and Sensibility

I think this film, in its own way, is an even more impressive achievement than ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (Ang Lee's latest film).  After watching the film in its entirety, I viewed it twice more with the commentaries provided!  First commentary with Emma Thompson and Lindsay Duran (co-producer) and second commentary with Ang Lee and James Schamus (another co-producer).  I wish Emma and Ang had done commentary together.  Lindsay Duran was actually insightful and nice, but James Schamus came off as a jerk.  Every time Ang would try to say something heartfelt or artistic, Schamus would interrupt or make some tacky remark.  Oh well, producers can be crude, as we all know or suspect.  Emma's comments are wonderful of course.  This is such a great film.  I highly recommend the DVD transfer to those who love the film.",Sense and Sensibility
144,FigNewton,Timeless Masterpiece,10,21 August 2001,"Unless a period film is well adapted it tends to be long, boring, and tedious for the viewer.  Not so with ""Sense and Sensibility""  It is one of the best period pieces in years.  Emma Thompson deserved the Oscar for her adaptation of this Jane Austen classic novel.  Not only did she do a great job as a writer but as the protagonist of Elinor Dashwood, she was excellent!  The whole cast ensemble was remarkable.  Kate Winslet portrayed the not-so-reserved Marianne Dashwood to perfection. Your heart fell to pieces for her character as her love for one man Willoughby was dashed, while the admiration of Col. Brandon she dismissed just as quickly.  Alan Rickman played the role vividly and soundly and you could grieve with his anguish as he attempted to win the affections of the younger Marianne.Hugh Grant was lovable as the timid Edward Ferrars and I can't think of another actor who could've pulled this role off as well as he did!The film takes its time telling this most touching tale of two sister's who are left dowryless by the greed of family members at the death of their father, and are forced to live almost in poverty according to the day's standards.  It was a time when a dowry was the most important thing a woman could offer entering a marriage and if you lacked one, your chances of marrying well were relatively non-existent.The struggles we endure with the very two opposite Dashwood sisters was so well told and acted that you felt you were right in the room with them.  I hadn't cried for years during a movie until I watched ""Sense and Sensibility"".  It will touch your heart and if you're not a fan of period films, this one will surely convert you into one!  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Sense and Sensibility
145,amabiliscasa,"Wonderful, Spirited Adaptation of Jane Austen's Novel",10,1 December 2002,"I borrowed ""Sense and Sensibility"" from a friend and watched it on their recommendation, not expecting to like it very much. It looked boring, and a little flat, even though I generally like this sort of film.Surprise, surprise, I watched it three times and loved it. Emma Thompson did a truly superb job on the screenplay, as evidenced by her Oscar win. The entire film is bright, cheerful, and romantic. The sets, scenery, and costumes are a feast for the eyes; they truly transport you to 1800's England. Thompson does a wonderful job portraying the sensible, reserved Elinor and Hugh Grant is quite good as the bumbling, ernest, but lovable Edward Ferrars. Their love story is really quite sweet. For myself, however, the most interesting charecters were those of Marianne Dashwood and Colonel Brandon. Kate Winslet absolutly stole the picture as the passionate, impulsive Marianne, and was the personification of young love and innocence. Alan Rickman was likewise terrific as the handsome Colonel who longs for Marianne. His subtle performance speaks of Brandon's long hidden inner passions which make him Marianne's soul-mate from the very beginning.SPOILEROne of my favorite parts of the film was the poetry reading scene at Barton Cottage, wherein Marianne begins to display faint signs of affection for the Colonel. It was very sweet, and tells volumes about the way courtships were conducted in the past. Marianne and Brandon, so obviously ment for each other, finally getting together - and then the wedding of the two, when they emerge from the church, arm in arm, beaming at each other, so obviously truly happy at last, for me that was the most romantic scene in the film, and a truly great movie moment. If you haven't seen ""Sense and Sensibility"" yet, I highly recommend it. I give it 9 out of 10 stars - it may seem a little slow to some and is definetly not for the unromantic or unsympathetic. A solid show, nevertheless.",Sense and Sensibility
146,angles924,One of the best films of all times.,10,20 August 2000,"I have to admit that I was a little skeptical at first about this  movie. I was a big Jane Austen fan and Sense and Sensibility was one of  my favorite books of all time. However, after watching this movie and  reading the book, you get a better understanding of all the characters  and the genius of Jane Austen. The performances were extraordinary,  with Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman, and Hugh Grant. The  costumes were beautiful and the scenery was breathtaking. Thompson, who  wrote the screenplay herself, did an amazing job. Although she took  some liberties to change some of the materials in the book, she  deserved the Oscar for best screenplay. The scene in which Col.Brandon  carries Marrianne back to the house is so hauntingly beautiful and a  startling echo of the earlier scene where Willoughby does the same to  the injured Marrianne. Alan Rickman, I believe, gives his best  performance as the moody Col.Brandon who is completely taken by  Marrianne. You wonder how he can be her second choice when he is such a  gentlemen and so full of charm. This film renewed my faith in good film  making completely. Ang Lee is one the most talented and brilliant  directors ever. It might have surprised a lot of people to see a  Taiwanese director directing such an English film, but I say the  choice was well made. Bottom line is: S&S demonstrates what great film  making is and what great writing is like, as well as what great  performances are. A must see. 10/10",Sense and Sensibility

To begin with, it is an exquisite visual experience, enhanced by grand music, every frame a mini-masterpiece, so that it is a little as if Vermeer led us through the story. And of course the production values are top-drawer in every detail of period setting, costumes, etc. The cast is stellar (with just the idea that Edward and Elinor remain a little too in awe of the Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson who play them... Could other actors, slightly less imposing, have brought out these main characters better?) Everyone else is perfect, with extraordinary performances from Kate Winslet as Marianne, Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, Greg Wise as the villanous Willoughby, and the striking presences of Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings and Robert Hardy as Sir John Middleton.

Margaret was such a typical 11-13 yr. old girl and made the movie a little more real. Emma and Kate were good choices for the sisters as well. i wish that they had kept the kiss between Edward and Eleanor in the movie as it made it possible to understand these characters a little better plus it was romantic. i am glad i have added this movie to my Jane Austin movie collection. especially due to Alan rickman and also to Hugh grant..,Sense and Sensibility

Initially, I had to get used to nearly all the characters being cast by actors who are much as 15 to 20 years too old for their parts. Winslet and Francois are nearly the only 2 that are the correct age for their characters. But everyone is so good that within 45 minutes I had more than forgiven the casting oddity and just enjoyed it immensely.Emma Thompson rightly deserved the Oscar for this screenplay (I even remember her accepting the Oscar - she was genuinely stunned!) It ""sparkles."" The dialog is endearing and quick without being too ""contemporary,"" the performances are likewise easy and elegant without being either stilted or, again, too modern. Margaret's character particularly is given a wonderful treatment here seen in no other adaptation. (Where is Emilie Francois now!?!? She is just wonderful in this!) The cinematography is breathtaking and the music heartbreaking. It's silly to dwell on the little parts that ""don't match"" with the book because Thompson so perfectly captured spirit of the novel.

No amount of acting can make up for this horrific casting, which ruined the entire film.

I thought Emma Thompson treated Austen's original work of art with the utmost respect and adapted this book beautifully for the screen. I hate most movies that are adapted from books; but not this one! All of the essentials are here. (I should say that most of the movie versions of Austen's works are very well done. Very rarely does any film-maker trifle with Austen!) If you like dignified, intelligent movies then this would definitely be for you. The dialogue just flows, and every element successfully transports me to this beautiful world of fiction. The actors and actresses did a wonderful job, but I do have to agree that Hugh Grant was just a little too attractive for Edward. But that's such a trifle. I really can't praise this movie enough!

His tortured confusion when he visits Elinor to finally declare his love, only to discover his fiancee there, is wrenching.

Emma Thompson was literally closer in age to play the mother ( Emma was 36 and the mother was supposed to be 40) so instead what they did they made the mother look like she supposed to be I don't know 60? And here's a thing it's one thing if you're an actress and you look younger than you are I know when I was 35 I did look like I was still in my mid 20s..... but Emma looks like she could play 45 before she plays a 25 LET ALONE A 19 year old. And as much as I love Rickman, he is supposed to be 35!!!!! I guess they maybe made everybody super old looking in order to justify Emma Thompson playing a 19-year-old? I don't know, but in that case Kate Winslet should've been played by somebody who was also in their 30s. So for this annoying reason I'm not gonna give this movie a good rating I hate it when they cast for the sake of big Hollywood stars instead of casting people who would play the characters correctly.

We have Marianne expressing that a person should marry only for love, true love, one that is intense and fiery but then at the end we have Marianne marrying the Colonel who she clearly does not love AT ALL and she just settled for him because the man she truly loved left her for a lady with more money, I could say more about her sister and how she just forgave the man who cheated on her but we see that they both love each other so I can overlook that but I REALLY can't swallow that Marianne/Colonel marriage at end, it seems forced and goes against the moral of the movie, which kinda ruined it for me",Sense and Sensibility

Kate Winslet was wonderful too. Her character was a bit too quirky & dreamy for my taste but that just displays her master of the art of acting too. MAN! I thought I was a hopeless romantic (modern-day) but her character was just over-the-top! I'm rather glad she ended up w/the Col. Brandon versus the equally hopeless-romantic Willoughby. Was it mean of me to be happy that Willoughby left? No - I thought he was too fake anyway although Marianne fell for it. Funny, I couldn't help seeing The Sheriff of Nottinghame & worse yet Professor Snape when watching Alan Rickman though. Wonderful actor but it doesn't hurt to see handsome folks on screen (of which I personally don't think Rickman is - to each their own though) but I think that made it even more believable, right?

Even Hugh Grant's particular brand of amiable foppishness seems to suit Edward rather well.The dramatic scene in the novel in which Willoughby appears at the sick bed of Marianne is completely ignored, and I would have been interested to see how the film approached this.

I find Emma Thompson's writing self-absorbed and unfaithful to the original book; she has reduced Marianne to a side-character, a second fiddle to her much too old, much too severe Elinor - she in the movie is given many sort of 'focus moments', and often they appear to be there just to show off Thompson herself.I do understand her cutting off several characters from the book, but leaving out the one scene where Willoughby in the book is redeemed? For someone who red and cherished the book long before the movie, those are the things always difficult to digest.As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. She is not given the best script in the world to work with but she still pulls it up gracefully, without too much sentimentality.

Not in its portrayal of events - but in its tone, the spirit of its characters and in its portrayal of the moral issues and concerns that are prevalent in all Austen's works.In other movie adaptations, the quieter, more serious themes are generally lost or glossed over and the characters are too modern and assertive or behave in ways that would never have occurred in a Jane Austen novel.Would Anne have chased Frederick the way Amanda Root did in Persuasion the movie? Of course not. Persuasion was praised for being so realistic-looking. Pity they didn't spend as much time in character analysis - several of the characters behaved in ways that were annoyingly unlikely of Austen's characters. Other examples include Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow and all the popular Pride and Prejudice adaptations (with Greer Garson, Jennifer Ehle and Keira Knightley), etc. These were all enjoyable, sure - they took all Austen's wit and humour, all her lightness and brightness...and effectively portrayed Austen as a modern and witty romance writer with no greater depth.Austen gets better treatment here with Emma Thompson's script.

But I digress.....As for Emma Thompson being too old to play Elinor Dashwood, well, she hasn't a line on her face and could pass for someone in her twenties, at least the way she is lit and made up in THIS film.

175,fluttergrrl,Perfect movie,10,24 June 2000,"This is a lesson for young, future film-makers or even current film makers that to create a successful and well-crafted movie there need not be the sex, violence and profanity which is rampant in so many of today's movies. The entire crew produced excellent performances, especially Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson. The latter should also be praised on her screen writing capabilities. This is one of my favourite movies and I cried at the end. Definitely one to buy. Trust me- you'll love it.",Sense and Sensibility
176,Lilith-20,Could you possibly ask for more?,10,21 January 2001,"This is my all time favourite adaption of one of the best novels ever made. And since it's filled with my favourite actors and actresses (except from Hugh Grant, of course...) I was pretty exalted about seeing it for the first time.Now I've seen it like ten times and I find more and more to love about it. Emma Thompson should have a thousands oscars for her beautiful deeds in this film, not only as an excellent actress but also as the one who changed the novel to a script. she's done everything right.  and could Ang Lee possibly have found any better actors for the parts? I really doubt. Kate Winslet is stunning as Marianne, the wild, strong girl who got full attention from two very special men. Hugh Grant gives us the usual performance of a nervous, very English guy (please, could someone give him a different part, at least once!) but I forgive him in this lovely film however. and Alan Rickman- he's just wonderful! He gives Brandon the right amount of sadness, tenderness and love- and sweeps anyone of their feet just by being in the scene. And God, that voice! Why on earth would Marianne chose anyone else but him?Emma Thompson is probably the best actress ever. I adore her. Her performance is brilliant. She's brilliant. The whole film is so brilliant!",Sense and Sensibility
177,AidaEpi,Best adaptation of Jane Austen,10,1 March 2001,"I first saw the movie this year, after it was screened in the television. The settings are simply lovely, the cast develop their characters as the story enfolds until the end. Emma Thompson shines as the sensible Elinor Dashwood and Kate Winslet gave an astounding performance as Marianne Dashwood. The performance of Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon is excellent since we pitied him for his great disappointments and past history. The supporting cast are really delightful,alongside with the  leading roles (note for the youngest sister of Dashwood, Margaret). Even though to some viewers the movie seemed slow paced, but the time is sufficient for the story line to grow and move until the end. This movie simply delights the female gender, knowing that we can relate the struggle of Elinor as the sensible sister and the outrageous Marianne to our daily life.",Sense and Sensibility
178,krasik,"The contradictions of duty and love, and the maturity born of suffering",8,26 November 2010,"Fascinating film - that gives me much to think about.The film is an essay on the dialectic between passion and duty. It also describes a young woman's - Marriane's - coming of age, in the sense of maturity born of suffering. Perhaps the movement from passion to duty is the sign of maturity. The film teaches us to guard against out passions by observing well the character of our companions. In particular to see how another bears their duty. The movie starts with a son's failure to fulfill his duty.It also shows that money can be as strong and stronger a force than love - and as Marriane later indicates, that this may be a valid position.It also shows how bitter suffering can be redemptive, teaching us to cherish the solid goodness that is within reach, and look skeptically upon grand and romantic illusions.",Sense and Sensibility

I've seen Sense and Sensibility before, but it was when I was little. I saw it tonight and I fell inlove. I know when a movie is good, when 10 or 20 minutes after the film is over you are are still crying or laughing or shocked. I was crying for 20 minutes after, so I know this is an amazing film. I love everything about it. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet both acted their hearts out, they deserve all the praise thats been giving them. Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant also put in top Notch performances.   The script is just great, she certaintly deserved the oscar. I gave this movie a 10, because of the story,acting, and just great scenery and intrigue to keep it interesting.",Sense and Sensibility
180,marcus-fabius,Shows the power of Film to touch our emotions,10,3 April 2014,"To really understand and appreciate the great beauty of this film, the viewer has to be aware of the cultural norms and constraints that society imposed on individuals in the period the film is set in. Any attempt to compare those norms and values to modern norms and values is simply pointless. In this respect, Emma Thompson and the Director Ang Lee did a brilliant job in this film. The entire plot of the film rests on the invidious obligations, social structures and legal diktats of the period, such as English inheritance law, breach of promise law, rigid class-based social stratification, and so on. The very strong impression I get from repeated viewing of the film is that the characters generally complied with their obligations more or less with resignation, an important exception being Marianne, but she learns the reality of those constraints in the hardest way. The cinematography is superb: wonderful vistas of open country estates, rain and wind swept meadows and rural life being presented with great flair. I constantly found myself looking at background details, such as the footmen standing behind the rich people at their tables: most likely, if I had lived in that period, I would be one of those standing behind. Or perhaps driving a carriage for the rich folk. So much to think about in this film. As for the actors, they are simply superb and inspired casting all round. I cannot single out any of them above the others, so I would comment on the most powerful scenes in the film that work heavily on the emotions (which is where the film genre triumphs): 1) the scene where Willoughby rides out of the mist and rain to rescue Marianne is simply superb; 2) the scene where Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon first sets eyes on Marianne is so charming; 3) the most emotional scene is where Edward explains to Elinor that he is not married. Elinor's reaction is extraordinary, and both Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson are superb here; 3) the most powerful scene in the film for me says it all: Willoughby looking down from the hill at the church, knowing he has lost Marianne and thrown away his future by his own actions: a totally impressive scene. Superb.This film stands repeated viewing. The music will pull you in and the characters will haunt you, and you will want to go over it again and again. If you have any emotional triggers, prepare to have them pulled by this great film.Marcus Fabius",Sense and Sensibility
181,KWinslet,I can watch this movie over and over and over,10,2 June 1999,"Sense and Sensibility is quite possibly my favorite movie of all time.  I can say this without shame and I am a guy.  This film displays so much heart, character, warmth, and a rich dialogue to boot.  Emma Thompson won a well-deserved Oscar for this fabulous screenplay (if you really liked the film you can buy the screenplay and diaries).  Kate Winslet should have won an Oscar for her emotionally deep performance as Marianne Dashwood, a woman that refuses to hide her passions.  Thompson also is superb as Elinor, Marianne's sensible sister.  Every time I watch this movie it gets just a little bit better.  Who can ever forget Alan Rickman as the gentlemanly Colonel Brandon or Hugh Grant as the stuttering Edward.  This film holds you captive throughout the girls struggles, and will have you thinking about in long after viewing.  If you haven't seen this film, run to the video store and rent it this moment!!!!",Sense and Sensibility
182,jbashe,Excellent costume piece from the Jane Austen story,9,2 December 1999,"I saw this movie reluctantly, with my wife.  I expected to dislike a slow period piece, especially Jane Austen.  To my surprise (and enjoyment), I liked the movie, the stars, and Emma Thompson's script.  I shouldn't have been so surprised, as I have enjoyed the work of Ms. Thompson, Mr. Grant, Mr. Rickman, and recently, Ms. Winslet.  Not to take away from the rest of the cast, I found Greg Wise's portrayal of Willoughby as convincing and dislikeable.  Ang Lee's direction is evident here, speeding the pace when needed, lingering when called for.  A great introduction into English story telling for anyone.",Sense and Sensibility

The movie is faithful to the Austen novel in its mood and depiction of her characters.

184,ej_edwards,Emma Thompson at her best,10,18 February 2000,"This is possibly THE best adaptation of a Jane Austen novel of all time (with stiff competition from the BBC's 1995 version of Pride and Prejudice). In her exquisite screenplay, Emma Thompson has portrayed the essence of Austen's novel perfectly, and the directing - courtesy of the excellent Ang Lee - captures rolling English country side (second only to the green valleys of Wales!) and the array of fine performances. The cast boasts the talent of not only Emma Thompson herself as elder sister Eleanor(two OSCARS don't do her enough justice) but a pre-Titanic Kate Winslet as the passionate Marianne, Greg Wise as the dashing but dastardly Willoughby, Hugh Grant in his usual dithering, floppy-haired Englishman and Alan Rickman as the subdued Brandon.

185,ladycordelia18,Excellent adaptation!,10,23 July 2007,"Major kudos to Emma Thompson (Elinor Dashwood) for the screenplay, and for her performance. So what if critics thought she was too old for the role? I also think Hugh Grant was a really good Edward Ferrars, another point on which critics nitpick too much. I mean, I totally can't imagine anyone else being bumbling, stuttering Edward. More kudos.Probably my biggest kudos, however, go to Kate Winslet. She was born for such dramatic roles as that of Marianne Dashwood. Love the scene where Marianne sings ""Weep You No More, Sad Fountains""--who knew that Kate Winslet could sing? And who knew that Alan Rickman could fall in love at first sight on-screen? Certainly not I, who'd only ever seen him in untrustworthy, if not necessarily evil, roles (Sheriff of Nottingham ring a bell? Professor Snape?). But he was perfect as Col. Brandon, what more can I say? Loved the plot, loved the costumes, loved the scenery. A well deserved 10 out of 10.",Sense and Sensibility

188,iluvcrayons07,beautiful (spoiler),10,12 June 2003,"Sense and Sensibility is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. Emma Thompson does a beautiful job of the quiet, reserved yet hopelessly in love Elinor, and Kate Winslet is amazing as the passionate, lovestruck Marianne. Hugh Grant does a great job as the bumbling suitor, and Alan Rickman also great on his performance of the longing Colonel with a tragic past. Mrs. Jennings, her daughter and son-in-law are hilarious, especially Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer. I've watched it three times in the last week and I plan on buying it. The ONLY thing that I couldn't stand about the movie was that while you know what the characters are feeling and going through, they never display their feelings, even between Marianne and Elinor, there is only one seen where I see them hug each other. Maybe I'm a huge sap, but I would have liked to see Elinor and Edward together more often, espescially them displaying their feelings for one another. I know the English were supposed to be stiff back then, but just a little more passion, and feelings and emotions.*SPOILER*You see that Elinor is suffering because of her lost hope at marrying Edward, but it is only in a few scenes, and not nearly emphasized enough (at least not for me). Also, I wish that we had seen all of Edward's proposal to Elinor, and even any of the Colonel's to Marianne. All in all, though, it was an excellent movie, except for the lack of emotion (I'm a hopeless romantic). 10/10 (also, the music was absolutely beautiful).",Sense and Sensibility

Though the story is slightly altered from the novel, there are no changes that completely alter the story. One critic- the changing of Colonel Brandons past. Telling the real story would not have made the film longer, only Brandons story more tragic. A well chosen cast- Emma Thompson is a lovely Elinor, Kate Winslet a passionate Marianne, and the best of all- Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon.

The dialog was excellent! The numerous balls in the book were very cleverly combined into one. The scenery was fantastic! The characters were all very well developed. The music was very well done.

I find the following two scenes most tear squeezing and touching: (a) When Marianne whispered on her sick bed a tender heartfelt 'thank you' to the distant Colonel while the man was just about to withdraw from her room after having finished doing what he was assigned. (b) When Elinor was smiling in tears toward the ending when Edward professed sincerely to her that he had remained an unmarried man and that his affection for her was, and always will be, hers.",Sense and Sensibility

You feel her repressed passion and love throughout the film. Kate Winslet is perfectly cast as the romantic, impulsive Maryanne. She absolutely shines in my mind. From the very start you are taken on a journey to a time when women had only their charms and beauty to secure their financial happiness and lively-hood. It is a story of two sisters, one who understands the way of the world and one who dreams of love, and passion. Hugh Grant plays the predictable bumbling English man as he does in all his movies, but to my mind the standout performance was the amazing Alan Rickman(Colonel Brandon). He delivers as the staid sombre Colonel with a huge heart.

Exactly how I pictured Col. Brandon to sound and look and walk and etc. For those of you who have not yet seen this film, I suggest it. For those who have been unfortunate enough to have had to read the book I pity you. Jane Austin yes is a brilliant author but she does tend to drag out everything. Rent the movie, curl up with your best girl friends or whoever you curl up with to watch sappy movies and have a good cry. I did, my flat mate did...all was good. Also, for those who have as big a thing for Rickman as I do... I warn you. He's at his most handsome in this movie IMO.

I do believe she should have won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress instead of Mira Sorvino who gave the performance of her career but Katie truly shined. However, Kate did manage to pick up the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress and the BAFTA Award, which is the British equivalent to the Academy Award.

It is true, that being an ardent lover of the so-called Romantic (as if the 13th century couldn't be Romantic or 17th, but these things are academic nonsense) period I can enjoy even minor pieces of period cinema, however this is most probably the best film set in the early 19th century. Although it centers on the relationship of the two sisters and their respective romantic relationships, it also seems to be a salute to the period itself in its precise description of the English country society. It is truthful to Jane Austen's novel, but Emma Thompson's script is fine in its own right, with many omissions and additions to the novel. The acting is superb, Kate Winslet as the typical Romantic dreamer (sensibility) is breathtaking (try not to be moved when her character wanders in the rain to see the house of her beloved and when she whispers half-deranged: 'Willoughby, Willoughby, Willoughby.') is perfect as is Emma Thompson as the rational but equally tormented older sister(sense). Greg Wise is perfect as the dashing semi-Byronic hero Willoughby and Allan Rickman as the mellow Brandon. To say nothing of the art direction, the music or the fantastic image composition.

It is never mentioned in the script but it was amusing to see the horrified look on her face, especially when one of the dogs neared her, how distraught she was, and how quickly she sped up her steps to get nearer to the cottage.. Margaret Dashwood, the youngest sister (who stole every scene she was in), begging them not to continue their conversation so she could hear what they were saying (she had left the room to get a cold compress for Marianne's ankle). Elinor stroking the embroidered initials of Edward Ferrars on the hankie he had loaned her. The quiet moments between Marianne and John Willoughby while he is tracing a drawing of her silhouette.

Emma Thompson and Ang Lee have transformed a not so interesting novel into a modern classic of cinema Not only was the film robbed of an oscar but also Kate Winslet as Marianne Dashwood- when will our Kate win one!? So settle yourself down for 2 hours of film making at its best; and even Hugh Grant is watchable!!,Sense and Sensibility
215,Pumpkindor,Movies don't get any better than this!,10,8 January 2003,"One of the top 10 movies ever made. Beautifully developed characterizations combined with Jane Austens meaningful & magnificent dialogue. Perfectly cast too. Not only should you be sure to see it, you should own it as well!",Sense and Sensibility
216,foolofatook98,poor adaptation of a literary masterpiece,3,20 September 2010,"I have just finished reading the book and was very excited about watching the film. Looking at the cast and the received score my expectations were great to say the least. To my disappointment they were, after viewing only first half an hour, far too great for this adaptation.Although some of the cast did the job exceedingly well, the script did not allow room for them to bring their characters to life. The script deviated from the original work so much in some parts it was almost painful to watch. A masterpiece should not have to suffer for want of a running time, nor should it be rewritten for the sake of inducing a few chuckles in the viewer. I might not judge it so harshly have I not just read Jane Austen's masterpiece and am still under the impressions of her great work. In the review section I have seen nothing but praises so I must conclude the fault must be more in my own tendency towards books rather than their ecranisations and belief the work of masters should never, not even slightly, be changed.",Sense and Sensibility
217,achtungbaby78,"Wonderful story, great actors, great sensibility!",9,27 February 2003,"It moves me every time I see it....! Wonderful story by Jane Austen, and well deserved Oscar for Emma Thompson, for the screenplay. Very good actors as Kate Winslet, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Gemma Jones and all the others... make this movie a classic, undervalued by most people, in my opinion",Sense and Sensibility
218,spivey-789-581874,The best big screen adaptation of Austen ever,10,19 September 2018,"I was incensed to discover that this film merely has a score of 7.7 
What are you thinking people???
Consequently I submit this correction in the form of a 10/10 in the hope of pushing up the average. As there are many thousands of ratings I fear this is a lost cause but one worth the fighting. Sense & Sensibilty is not Austen's best novel. It is a truth universally accepted that that title belongs to Pride & Prejudice. Opinion on what is her second best remains divided. Persuasion often claims that mantle, or perhaps Emma (though not according to Jane Austen who hated her selfish protagonist) Sense & Sensibility seems to scrap it out with those two for the silver medal. The weaknesses in this story largely come from the male leads who are far less impressive than the imposing Mr Darcy nor as caddish as the notorious Mr Wickham. However Emma Thompson ably addressed that problem with her sparklingly witty script that justly won her an Oscar. ('96 was a good year even if Braveheart was over lauded & The Usual Suspects under appreciated) 
Superior casting also gives the film its charm. The choice of Hugh Grant was inspired, bringing a touch of humour to the rather wet Edward Ferrers & the late, great Alan Rickman brought gravitas to everything he did. In truth the casting was superb all round. The film is a veritable who's who of British talent. A young Kate Winslet burst into the stage with her first Oscar nomination as Marianne the romantic idealist who understandably falls for Greg Wise's dashing but dastardly (by Austenite standards) Mr Willoughby. Even a pre-House Hugh Laurie pops up to steal every scene he's in with a few barbed remarks and a dry delivery. Who, back then, would have predicted his rise to international fame?
Ang Lee makes Georgian England look both beautiful but gritty. We see the rustic beauty of Devonshire, but witness the girls shivering in their beds. They attend a great ball, but must avoid the horse dung that is strewn along the approach to it. 
Cinematographer Michael Coulter ably paints this world of sharp contrasts, making the scenery as beautiful as he did on four weddings and a funeral the year before, whilst also providing the gloom. A heartbroken Marianne, seeking a gloomy Combe Magna, whilst mournfully reciting Shakespeare's sonnets looked suitably rainswept. Kate Winslet really nails that soggy but lovelorn look. Even more so when she was escaping the Titanic a few years later.
Patrick Doyle also deserves a mention in dispatches for an excellent musical score that ably recreated the feel of the time as well as matching the emotions. ""My father's favourite"" often is played on Classic FM. It's one of my favourites too. I cannot, off the top of my head, think of anything I disliked. I enjoyed movies in the 90s so much more than I do now. All the Oscar nominations for '96 were memorable. I haven't watched any of this years offerings & haven't respected the choices of the academy for years. To me the majority are self indulgent twaddle and films have been overtaken by television in my esteem. Sense & Sensibility was a gem from a superior cinematic era. 
It was, to my mind, the best adaptation of her work. The best adaptation. Her second best novel.",Sense and Sensibility
219,newtonjoyce,Gallantry,10,4 July 2004,"I really enjoy the wholesome content of movies made such as this one. For producers and writers to take a classic and put it on screen is a sure fire success. Especially, when it is of a wholesome nature. Very few of them exist today, so our family enjoys watching moral and clean films like this. From a historical content, we can learn much of women's roles and how they have changed. Men's roles as well. There were advantages and disadvantages to both. If only we were all consciousness and honorable as days past. If only we were all God fearing and attended church as a well turned person would. To heat a house such as those would be a challenge and to have servants would be fun. I wish I had a ""cottage"" like that one!",Sense and Sensibility
220,clarific,one word: wow.,10,10 January 2005,"This is a truly great movie. It is one that I can watch over and over, yet can never seem to get enough of! Kate Winslet is gorgeous, Emma Thomson is inspiring, and Hugh Grant shines in this unforgettable film. I have always loved a good movie; one i can sink into and fall in love with the characters. I feel that Sense and Sensibility presents all these things to the audience. There is love, heartbreak, humour and great music. (my applause to Kate Winslet for her unforgettable versions of ""Weep You No More Sad Fountains"" and ""The Dream"" ...so beautiful.) If you have not seen this movie, please go RIGHT now to rent it...or even ADD it to your video library! I must say it is well worth it! And if you have seen it. ....you know what i mean.Brava! Brava! Bravo!Here are some other movies of this sort that i think this type of audience may enjoy:Pride and Prejudice. starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.Emma. starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam.Ever After. starring Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott.",Sense and Sensibility
221,karlasuep,highly recommended,10,13 January 2005,"Sense and Sensibility is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Emma Thompson is superb, both with the writing and in her acting. She expresses so much with her eyes that you know what is going on in the character's heart without a word being spoken. This movie now ranks right up there with ""The Sound of Music"" as a movie that I could watch over and over. It is a sweet romance that is sure to touch anyone's heart. The casting is perfect and all of the characters are believable. Alan Rickman did a great job as Colonel Brandon. He made me completely forget his other roles as evil characters and was believable as a sensitive, self-less gentleman. I highly recommend this movie and wish there more movies being made like this one.",Sense and Sensibility
222,honeyblob,Kate's singing,10,4 March 2005,"I'm totally entranced with the scene when Colonel Brandon watches Marianne singing. This is truly one of the most romantic entrances on film. I can only wish that Alan Rickman would look at me the way he looks at Kate Winslet . Deep sigh! My question is whether Kate Winslet did her own singing/piano playing ......... I've watched the credits right thru and there is no screen credit for the vocals on that piece .......text is anonymous and the music composed by the film's composer. I've listened to Emma Thompson's audio commentary track ( which is superb) ands although she does mention the film's score, she doesn't note whether it is Kate singing or playing. Kate is so lovely and talented that I do hope she is singing. Does anyone out there in Sense and Sensibility fandom know?",Sense and Sensibility
223,woodstalkandsnoopy,"Wonderfully casted, wonderfully acted, wonderfully wonderful!",7,17 June 2005,"I really do love this film. I find it has a very unique sense about it since back then when Sense and Sensibility was still a book, everyone was so lets just say somewhat private and really they all were trying to be polite by not inquiring very much. So it really has a sense of humor about that isn't really its very strongest element but it is very a strong quality. I find it very difficult to have a balance of comedy and of truth and weightiness. And I find that it has a lovely mixture of both. Also I find it very enjoying to watch if you are British as am I. And I find the music very nice. This movie was a joy to watch especially with Alan Rickman in it I find him a very good actor.",Sense and Sensibility
224,pat-cousineau,Broke my heart,10,9 December 2019,This movie had me in tears. Now I have to read the original text!,Sense and Sensibility
225,sdavis0077,Beautifully written with memorable characters,10,26 November 2014,"I saw the trailer when it first came out and thought to myself, ""I'd like to see that but never did until 2014!"" Where was I really, never taking time out to experience such a gem of movie which will maintain such a classic standing ? I watched this movie several times within the week searching for other movies within the same genre. Emma Thompson was magnificent! Of course I remember her in Nanny McPhee and thought to myself either she is in hiding or I've been too busy with life to enjoy her screenplays. This is very sad to say but true but now that is over and I will smell the roses while they bloom enjoying the fragrance of romance on screen. And of course who could have a romance without Hugh Grant another favorite. His hesitant way of playing the chords of love on a woman's heart cannot be duplicated. Colonel Brandon is the breaker of the mold ""wait for it."" He marks himself as a true gentleman and one who understands the heart. The mom of these lovely ladies was a true mom and no doubt a lady indeed.",Sense and Sensibility
226,lokihattere,Great Classic,8,26 June 2015,"From beginning to end this movie has comedy, romance, and angst in it to help move it along. A great adaption to the book and by far the best seen even compared to modern versions. Grant plays the broody character that is quiet and submissive to culture times. Thompson plays the quiet shy mouse that doesn't hesitate to help her family. The side stories that twine themselves to the main characters one way or the other keep it entertaining. The guest starring Hugh Laurie from House MD and Alan Rickman from Harry Potter are a great additions to the cast. By far this movie is 2 hours and 17minutes of a great classic not many other movies compare to.",Sense and Sensibility
227,hosken-1,Emma Thompson is splendid (as always) and Alan Rickman is superb,9,1 August 2006,"This film is a delightful rendition of the novel. I think Alan Rickman's portrayal was fabulous. This is the best of the Pride and Prejudice movies. The juxtaposition between the London and countryside scenes is not a detriment to the viewer and the ""novel"" narrative is easily followed. For high school teachers there are some excellent Emma Thompson scenes that bring 19th century England and its mores to life. It is a film that lends itself to selecting a few parts without necessarily viewing the whole film to prompt discussion. However, I heartily recommend that you enjoy the whole film---it's great fun, well-filmed, directed and acted.",Sense and Sensibility
228,annmarietirone,Great Movie with Pure Raw Human Emotion,10,28 September 2005,"Sense & Sensibility is a great movie worth seeing. I cannot say that it is any one specific thing that makes it so great because I believe that it is a combination of everything. The story line is wonderful, the costumes are great and the actors are terrific. I have never seen anyone play pure ""raw human emotion"" any better than Emma Thompson has done in this movie. (Unfortunately, I cannot share with you my most favorite part in the movie because it would spoil the fun for those who have not seen the movie yet.) I was not fortunate enough to see this movie on the big screen when it came out in 1995 but I did see it on video several times afterward and it was still spectacular. It is worth seeing more than once and appreciated each time. It remains my most favorite movie since I saw it!",Sense and Sensibility
229,tatiana-pot,Bummer,6,3 April 2020,I can not deny that the scenery the clothes and the cinematography are beautiful. But something just didn't add up. I hated the fact that Marian ended up with Mr. Brandon but never the less I would expect from a movie that made so many changes to the original script to justify it a little bit more. I also didn't love the fact that Elinor in the book is so young whilst Emma was much older. Great actress though. I think I just can't handle a book being adapted to a movie. It missed so much of the important stuff. Anyway still liked it. Would recommend reading the book after or before to just get the characters and the hole story better.,Sense and Sensibility
230,treehuggermc,Beautiful,10,24 December 2018,"This movie was perfect... except for one thing...Kate Winslet and Alan Rickman looked horrible together. Yes, he was supposed to be older, but he looked like he could easily be her dad, even her grandpa. That was a bit distracting. Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant were adorable.",Sense and Sensibility
