0,Leofwine_draca,Mindless sequel,4,12 September 2020,"A sequel to the largely average film that nobody asked for, KILLER QUEEN sees the geeky hero from THE BABYSITTER once more subjected to the machinations of the members of a Satanic cult with bloodshed and murder in mind. It's an action-oriented narrative with tongue firmly in cheek, packed full of pop culture references and jokes and very little more besides. The characters are bland and one-dimensional, the jokes scatological, and the OTT death sequences surprisingly repetitive and tiresome, with every cast member seemingly getting a bucket of blood chucked in their face at some point in the movie.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
1,kosmasp,Comedy Horror up to 11,8,20 September 2020,"You don't have to have seen the first movie to enjoy this one, but it does make sense. Also you will know if this is for you. The second one adds even more humor, at least at first. In the beginning this feels like another American Pie ... the humor would fit, including a father walking in on you ... or is he? And are you? Sometimes just having a certain predicament is funny, even if the truth is not that important but the perception.And that is true for the horror that kicks off after a while. And when that happens all hell breaks loose! Pun intended I reckon. If you are squeamish, do not watch this. If you don't like gore mixed with humor, you might also take offense to the movie itself. I thought it was more than entertaining enough. Some flaws are there, but the movie is too much fun to think about them (at least I feel that way)",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
2,Sleepin_Dragon,Proof that follow ups can be better.,8,10 September 2020,"There are some familiar faces and some new ones, Cole once again battles members of a Devil cult.I was unsure of the first film, but on second watch I enjoyed it, no second viewing was needed for this one, I loved it on first watch.This is very funny, it's full of shocks and surprises, it's entertaining from start to finish. The characters are once again utterly outrageous, and once again the guy with the muscles has his shirt off throughout.One of the best films I've seen on Netflix for a while, 8/10.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
3,Tweekums,Not as good as the first but still fun,7,2 July 2021,"These comments assume viewers have seen 'The Babysitter'.Two years after the events of 'The Babysitter' only his friend Melanie believes his version of what happened; everybody else, including his parents, think he is delusional. Since he refuses to say he imagined what happened his parents decide to send him to a specialist psychiatric school. The day he is due to be sent there Melanie invites him to join her, and a few of her friends, for some fun at the lake. Unfortunately for Cole the events of two years ago are going to restart... more teens need his blood to do a deal with the devil and the ghosts of those dispatched in the first film are back hoping that by completing the ritual before sunrise they can return to life. At least this time Cole has an ally in the form of Phoebe, the new girl in school who is rumoured to have killed her parents.I really enjoyed 'The Babysitter' so hoped this would be good too; while it isn't as good as the original it still manages to be fun. There are plenty of laughs to be had as well as entertainingly over-the-top gory deaths... assuming you like decapitations and spraying blood; and who doesn't!? Having the original villains return was good although sadly we see far less of Babysitter Bee in this one. The identity of the new villain is a bit of a surprise but does seem a little forced. The cast is solid enough and the soundtrack is pretty good. The change of location is good; the lake in the desert might be very open but it is still hard to escape from. I liked the addition of Phoebe, she is a nicely ambiguous character who seems to be a friend who one is allowed to suspect could turn into a final 'surprise villain. Overall I don't think this is quite up to the standard of the original but it is still well worth watching.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
4,BA_Harrison,That's it... I'm done with McG.,2,11 October 2020,"The Babysitter was a fun teen-oriented horror film that actually made me feel vindicated for having defended McG in the past (I'm not ashamed to say that I like Charlie's Angels). Killer Queen makes me feel sorry that I ever said good things about the man.Set two years after the first film, this sorry-ass sequel sees Judah Lewis returning as Cole, who is now in high school, considered a weirdo for his outlandish tales of killer babysitters and blood cults (and for the fact that he wears a brown, three-piece corduroy suit with pin badges on the lapel). History repeats itself when his best friend Melanie (Emily Alyn Lind) also turns out to be evil, having made a pact from beyond the grave with the deceased psychos from the first film to complete their Satanic ritual using Cole's blood.If McG's music video style has rankled in the past, this film is guaranteed to annoy, the director going into overdrive with trendy stylisms that make Edgar Wright look positively reserved. As if the puerile script wasn't bad enough (lame humour and numerous pop culture references), the use of computer graphics, grainy VHS style flashbacks, and various other random nonsense is atrocious. A sex scene plays out through the use of obvious visual metaphors; a fight scene is done in the style of a beat-'em-up computer game; there's a pointless dance routine. None of this makes any sense within the context of the film; it's just there for the sake of it.To be honest, the only good thing about this whole dreadful mess is the excessive gore, which is cartoonish but fun.To add a final insult to injury, Samara Weaving (a BA_Harrison pet peeve) returns at the very end as babysitter Bee, who turns out to be good, saving Cole and his love interest Phoebe (Jenna Ortega) from the bad guys. At least she doesn't get to do one of her horrible warbling screams: I guess we should be thankful for small mercies.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
5,paul_haakonsen,As enjoyable as the first movie...,6,10 September 2020,"Right, well I didn't even know that they were making a sequel to the 2017 movie ""The Babysitter"". I happened to sit down and find the movie on Netflix by sheer luck. And I did enjoy the 2017 movie, so of course I found the time to sit down and watch the 2020 ""The Babysitter: Killer Queen"".Okay, well I will say that ""The Babysitter: Killer Queen"" was actually as enjoyable as the 2017 predecessor movie. But at the same time, ""The Babysitter: Killer Queen"" deviated oddly from the first movie at some points, for better or worse, like it or not. The 2020 ""The Babysitter: Killer Queen"" had a bit more supernatural elements to it - some might enjoy that, others may not.The storyline in ""The Babysitter: Killer Queen"" was good and enjoyable. I think that writers Dan Lagana, McG, Brad Morris and Jimmy Warden actually managed to put together something interesting and entertaining.The acting in the movie was good, and it was actually fun to see returning characters from the first movie make appearances in this movie as well.I will say that ""The Babysitter: Killer Queen"" was pretty straight forward and streamlined, however. There weren't really any grand surprises or plot twists to the movie, which was a shame, because that would have elevated the overall enjoyment of the movie.""The Babysitter: Killer Queen"" is definitely a movie that will hit home and please those that enjoyed the 2017 ""The Babysitter"" movie. I am rating it a six out of ten stars.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
6,Calicodreamin,Not as good as original,5,11 October 2020,"Definitely a far cry from the original, the storyline was weak, the new cast members added nothing, and overall lacked charm.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
7,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Solid and enjoyable if just a slightly downgraded sequel effort,9,8 January 2021,"Still tormented by the past, the lone survivor of the blood sacrifice is talked into attending a wild party at a local lake to get away from it all, but when he realizes he's been led into a trap involving the original cult members to again steal his blood must team with a new friend to stop them from succeeding.This ended up being a solid enough sequel with some enjoyable aspects. There's a lot to like with this one is how it manages to expand upon the original with the same sense of fun and comedy that was present in that entry. The light-hearted attitude towards his obvious condition resulting from the trauma of the past events coupled with the high-school torture he gets from his friends and schoolmates as well as the crush-like attitude towards her gives this a strong atmosphere to get into this one, much like the constant innuendo and drug jokes that carry on throughout the final half here. When this one goes for the action, it's just as much fun and over-the-top as there's a lot of enjoyable confrontations to be found here. When it goes crazy with the twist involving the participants of the ritual and everything starts becoming similar to the previous assault is rather enjoyable when the old group returns and gets turned into a rapid-fire race through the desert. This leads into the same sort of fun from the original where they begin going through a series of over-the-top confrontations that plays off what happened before in how this shows how he gets away in the newfound encounters. Since this goes about with the idea of taking out the old crew first, the new ones are allowed to take over hunting the two down in the desert. Getting the series of extravagant confrontations that leave the main villain alive for the last battle allows for a fun time as this one piles on some frantic and engaging activities that not only plays off the knowledge of the original where it all comes full circle into the final defeat which is unique and creative. These aspects, alongside the wholly enjoyable practical effects for the multitude of kills throughout here, present this one with a lot of positive elements. There isn't much to dislike with this one. The main issue featured here is the completely unexplained motive for the allegiance flip that's found out here which doesn't get mentioned or fleshed out to the point of understanding why the switch occurs. Given how much of a shock it is that this happens in the first place, the need for understanding this twist to come about is there so the lack of resolution about it becomes quite underwhelming and lackluster. That also describes how the main battle between them is as the video-game effects and battle-screen layout looks obviously pandering, but for the most part, these are the main issues with it.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, underage sexual innuendo and drug use.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
8,trashgang,over the top,7,19 September 2020,"Sequel to The Babysitter from 2017. Again it's full of gore and funny situations. But it takes a while before it all starts.Positive is the fact that everybody who played in the original one is here to see again, all aged of course so some you might think, can't be but it is. Starts as a pure teen flick with high school and bully's and unsatisfied love sitiuations it took exactly half an hour of that, a bit too long for my opinion. But then things go over the top with bloody and extreme gory scenes.In between there are awkward situations and funny situations and sadly moments you think, really, way too long. But still it's worth a watch. Score and editing is top notch.Being gory the gorehounds out there will have a lot f issues because you can' take it all too serious.The same as the original one, so you know what you can expect from it.

9,thesar-2,Queen C's Turn,4,11 September 2020,"Yes, Queen was killer. Unfortunately, this movie was not.Wow...what an original sequel that felt... ""eh."" I LOOOVED the first Babysitter, mostly because of Bee and her chemistry with the hilarious Cole. Here, they were trying so hard to capture that lightning again, but mostly failed.In a unique spin, no one believes Cole of the deadly events of the first movie and in the two years since, his life seems to be going downhill. Whelp, nothing but a good ole boat trip with teens overnight with no parents, no rules and plenty of bloooood to brighten his demeanor.It's definitely original, and still funny, though about 50% less humor than the first one and boy, they tried some of the same gags, or even reversing them to very little effect. The actual new humor was pretty good and the kid (Cole - played by Judah Lewis) still has some of his charm.What was mostly missing was the title character. This wasn't her movie; this was Cole's and his aftermath of that horrible night 2 years prior. So, gone was the chemistry and her absolute charm that made the original film so loveable.I'd say, stick with only watching the original. If you are remotely curious, this isn't *that* bad, it's definitely entertaining but in the end, it'll just leave that famous question in your head: How Did This Get Made?***Final thoughts: Only saw the first one once, nearly three years ago on November 6th, 2017, so I thought I'd revisit it tonight before seeing the sequel. 90% just as good as the first time. What hurt it this time was all the surprises were gone and I knew when the humor and best gags were coming. Still, it was 10x the movie this 2nd and hopefully last Babysitter sequel was.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
10,Edvis-1997,3,3,25 December 2020,"I really enjoyed watching first part but this was totally garbage. You just need to take it and throw it away. Everything was bad, acting, plot, all that nonsense, so many plot jumps, it had 0 jokes that I found funny, it's just hideous. I wanted to see it because I watched first part and now I regret this decision. I just don't know why it's so overrated, the right imdb should be about the same as metascore from 2 to 3. One of the worst movie of this year.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
11,The-Sarkologist,How to Butcher a Good Film,4,14 December 2020,"Honestly, when I discovered that they had decided to make a sequal, and that it had only just been released, I thought 'what the hell', and decided to watch it. Honestly, that is time that I am really not going to get back again, namely because it ended up completely butchering the original film. Like, this film that ended up creating so many plot holes that it made me squirm with disgust. Then again, I probably shouldn't be all that surprised since one probably should expect that sequals have a habit of completely butchering an original, to the point that you basically want to pretend that it doesn't exist, but unfortunately it is just way too hard to unsee it.Like, what really got me was that they decided to make our protagonist's best friend as the big bad, which I just thought was really, really annoying, and certainly made no sense whatsoever. In fact, it just completely destroyed the film. Okay, I can sort of see why they decided to do it, and there are a couple of hints that this is the case, but honestly, it was basically a wasted effort.The other thing that was annoying was that they decided that there was no evidence that the events on the previous film happened. Yeah, come on, pull the other one. We have two missing cops, five missing teenagers, and a fireman that was stabbed while he was in the house, and all of a sudden people think that it was all the figment of his imagination. Yeah, that really didn't work, but I was sort of able to roll with that one, it was just when they decided to make Mel bad that it really put me off.Actually, Mel's Dad was a bit odd as well, though when I checked it out it is actually the same actor playing him, it is just that in the first film he came across as this suave ladies' man, and in this film he is suddenly a video-game playing pot head. Yeah, that really did confuse me, and once again it really didn't make any sense as all. Okay, I guess the whole let's make Mel evil sort of worked to open up some room for our protagonist to have another girlfriend, but yeah, in the end it was just annoying.Oh, and the ritual changed as well. In the first movie it was just a sacrifice, and you poured the blood on the book (and wasn't the book destroyed as well?), but now you need a sacrifice, and a virgin, and you drink the blood and get, well, I don't really know what you get, though since the kids from the first film were brought back, apparently it was just so that they could come back to life. Also, we get a bit of a back story on them as well, but once again, it seemed to just completely undermine everything we understood about the characters from the original film.Yeah, if you liked the first one, I'd pretty much recommending avoiding this one like the plague. It's pretty unoriginal, and completely destroys what had been set up in the first film.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
12,UniqueParticle,Different vibe but still great,8,16 October 2020,"Lost it's touch I understand the hate regardless I love the movie! Glad it's by the same director McG is wonderful at his craft, I enjoy almost his films.

17,robfollower,The Babysitter: Killer Queen(2020),8,25 September 2020,"2017's The Babysitter remains one of the most unexpectedly entertaining Netflix Originals ever, given that it was co-written and directed by none other than hack-for-hire McG.And while this recently-released sequel doesn't match the original's inspired level of gory insanity, it is nevertheless a follow-up unafraid to go balls-to-the-wall in the pursuit of knowingly trashy thrills.As much as it's a totally ""unnecessary"" sequel, it arguably justifies its existence through its self-aware, goofy tone, and commitment to splashing the screen with as much ridiculous gore as possible.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

24,I_Ailurophile,"Same flaws, yet notably better",4,17 December 2020,"You probably won't watch 'Killer queen' unless you've already seen its predecessor, so you know what to expect.Indeed, the formula hasn't changed: It still tries to sell viewers on its blend of campy-Satanic cult-slasher-coming off age-teen comedy tropes, and it still doesn't work. The production remains noticeably slick, too much so for its own good, and it wouldn't be a 'Babysitter' movie without obnoxious inserts a la 'Scott Pilgrim' and pop culture references that substantially weigh down what it could otherwise be.Despite all those flaws, 'The Babysitter: Killer queen' actually is a better movie. Even apart from the narrative growth beyond the first film, there are enough differences here to make it distinct, in a good way.There's more of an actual plot--and character development!--with real exposition for all the characters. The latter is mostly seen in flashbacks, especially for the antagonists, but that bit of background is welcome even if it disrupts the flow a bit. While the cast returns from the first movie, the new cast members do even more to carry the picture; again, characters seem fleshed out much more than before. I think I'd rather enjoy seeing these actors in other things.One small paragraph to describe the positives may not seem like much, but it really does count for a lot. There was a demonstrable effort to make this more of a solid movie, and it pays off. 'Killer queen' gets 2 more stars from my rating than its predecessor because of the improvements it has made.Unfortunately, the growth from one film to the next doesn't mean the flaws have vanished.That blend of tropes and genres is much the same here, with the difference of the ""teen comedy"" angle being played up considerably. Imagine listening to a mix of your favorite record where very specific notes in each song were emphasized so much that they overwhelm the rest of the music. Teen comedies are lame, with very juvenile humor, and that aspect has also been elevated in 'Killer queen' compared to 'The babysitter.'The flashes on screen of graphics and other overlaid effects is turned down a lot by comparison. Yet when 'Killer queen' does go for that unfortunate choice of flair, it's even more prevalent on screen. It's the difference between only part of a shot being filled with post-production visuals, and entire scenes being devoted to the same disruptions. It's embarrassingly bad.I want to like 'The babysitter: Killer queen' more than I do, but like the first movie, it's not as clever as it thinks it is. If the film-makers did away with the stylistic choices of those graphics and visuals, and focused on just telling a story, this would be so much better.I gather there's a possibility of a third film. While I don't think it's especially likely, despite myself I'd probably watch it--I've already committed to two 'Babysitter' movies, after all. Anyway, if McG gives the concept another go, maybe he'll further refine the formula and excise the unnecessary bits. We can hope.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
25,s3276169,Almost as painful than going through puberty a second time....,4,24 September 2020,"I'm not really a fan of this kind of film but the first one was alright and I was bored, so I took a look.As per usual these days male figures are either inadequate, irresponsible or stupid. Female characters ""strong and empowered"" or ""mysterious and empowered"".You get the idea. The pink background on the poster should have been enough to warn me off but well, silly me.On the upside acting is reasonable, setting and cinematography fine, basic slasher story is alright.In short, if you can look past the woke horse manure, its almost passable.

26,aidanratesmovies,Sigh...here we go again...,4,10 September 2020,"A mostly pointless, forced, and incredibly formulaic sequel- The Babysitter: Killer Queen is not only a horror installment that didn't need to happen, but a very odd film, that bears the question all throughout, why? Besides the films many frustrating and cliche moments, it does keep a consistent enough pace to keep you entertained. For horror fans, who don't mind the content as long as it is entertaining, the film is a rather average sequel with the same flaws as the first film. Unfortunately for me, being entertaining, was simply not enough. This film is absolutely braindead, with the script having the intelligence level of a very violent 7 year old. There is nothing new about this film, nothing exciting, nothing memorable, and absolutely nothing special. It's just incredibly bland. The acting is as mediocre as the first film, and though the film does seem to finally give us a somewhat interesting character (Phobe), Jenna Ortega's performance just doesn't seem to fit the character on screen, and it ends up making her performance look a bit forced. However, there is very little about this film that isn't forced, whether it is its outlandish plot, plot twists, or incredibly lack of originality- the film doesn't feel like it should have been made, let alone attempted. In the end, The Babysitter: Killer Queen is an unneeded sequel on all fronts, and I would be completely fine with the franchise dying here before this franchise can somehow get even worse out of hand.

Most of McG's films are like extended music videos; this one seems no different. There's a lot of eye-candy, a plot that can never make sense, cliched character sketches, some silly twists, and a few bucketfuls of gore. The humor is patchy; you'll get a laugh or two out of the blue but for more than 75% of the film, you'll be desperately looking for some.

32,IonicBreezeMachine,A worthy follow-up that revisits the fun of the first.,7,13 September 2020,"The Babysitter: Killer Queen was a very pleasant surprise in that it might be better than the first one. Two years have passed from the events of the first film and Cole is now an outcast who no one believes about the events of that night. Cole takes up an invitation from his friend Melanie for a weekend party at the lake but once there he finds himself revisiting the nightmare from which he thought he'd escaped.The first The Babysitter was a flawed but entertaining comedy slasher that I thought was enjoyable for the most part, but never thought it balanced its horror elements and comedic elements as well as it could've. With Killer Queen any pretense at horror is pretty much abandoned from the outset and this time around the movie the movie is a dark comedy that while it does contain the gore and violence of the original never makes any attempt to be scary. That said, the humor is still very much on point and has actually been refined since the previous outing flowing more smoothly and creating a better sense of comic rhythm with proper setups and payoffs some of which had me laughing to the point of tears in my eyes.While the comedy is very well done, the heart that was in place in the first one is still very much a part of the movie as we see Cole trying to cope with the fact that no one believes his story. This time around Cole(Judah Lewis) is joined by Phoebe(Jane the Virgin's Jenna Ortega) who also runs afoul of Cole's satanic cultists and makes a nice pairing with enjoyable banter and character moments that make them a pleasure to be around. Both Lewis and Ortega are still just amazing actors and they show amazing chemistry in their scenes together.The Babysitter: Killer Queen may not be a strictly ""necessary"" sequel, but it is a lot of fun that doesn't take itself too seriously. The movie does hint at the possibility of another installment(though given the ending I'm not sure how it would look like) and while that one will be just as unnecessary as long as it's on par with this one make as many of these as they did Elm Street movies.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
33,carbuff,One star because this is why sequels shouldn't be made,1,31 January 2021,"I won't write much of a review on this misfire. The original ""The Babysitter"" was off-the-wall and clever but never took itself seriously. It was an excellent and pretty unique film experience, at least if you're into campy humor/horror flicks.Therefore, I went into ""The Babysitter: Killer Queen"" with very high hopes. What a let-down. This flick is an unbearable mess. It's got a totally incoherent tone with no idea where it's going or what it's doing. Serious? Snarky? Humorous? ""Ironic""? Sardonic? Mockingly self-aware? Heartfelt? Campy? Frankly, seemingly anything a room full (""zoom"" full?) of overpaid yet uninspired screenwriters could throw against a wall as fast as they could following the unexpected success of the original (including direct and indirect references to Goethe's ""Faust"", no doubt reflecting an insufferable superiority regarding their philosophical and literary astuteness). This sequel is very obviously attempting to recapture the mysterious recipe that made the original such fun, but instead it comes across as a rank stew tossed together from spoiled left-overs. The original film never implied or needed a sequel, and after sitting though this, one never should have been made.Also, this movie badly needed some harsh editing, since it's at least 15 minutes too long. (On the other hand, maybe it was my good fortune to catch a much-vaunted ""Director's Cut"".) I only stuck it out because I really enjoyed the original and felt obligated to see how it all played out. I guess it's what women refer to as a ""charity"" watch. It was like when you had to see ""Kill Bill 2"" because you sat through ""Kill Bill 1"",not that I'm claiming there's anything of ""Kill Bill"" quality in this low-budget, brain-dead, Netflix cash-grab. Honestly, the only good thing about this film is that it's got a couple of hot women in it, or, alternatively, one-and-a-half hot guys in it (if that's your thing instead).""The Babysitter: Killer Queen"" is simply bad. Badly acted. Badly scripted. Not ""so bad it's good"" either. Just simply bad. I hate myself for wasting my time watching it. In conclusion, the only thing I liked about it was writing about how much I didn't like it.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

It gave me a few giggles here and there, plot is ok and characters are likeable enough. To be honest there's nothing that the film excels in, it's just an easy ""brainless"" watch.What I will say is that you need to watch the first instalment, because you won't have a clue about what's going on in this one.

51,themadmovieman,"A fun, enthusiastic sequel that surprisingly builds on the original",7,11 September 2020,"I liked the first Babysitter movie a lot. It was a great horror-comedy with a fun premise, great performances and crowd-pleasing thrills, and I'm delighted to say that its sequel follows in the same wake. Impressively building on the story established last time out, Killer Queen is a surprise hit throughout, with the same fun factor as its predecessor, but a story that arguably outdoes the first movie.On the whole, the first and second movies are largely similar, but the few differences that separate them do have an impact. On the one hand, it's fair to say that this sequel doesn't use its setting to a strong effect like the first movie, getting lost in a fairly soulless desert setting compared to the terrifying hellscape of Cole's house being destroyed over one night.What's more, the film is missing Samara Weaving's excellent performance, with Emily Alyn Lind brought into replace her, yet doing little to endear or entertain in quite the same devilishly exciting way.However, although Killer Queen misses out on some of the strengths of its predecessor, it also builds on the first film in some very surprising ways. For one, the film takes place in the context of Cole struggling at high school, and broadens its scope to include other characters as well as a cleverly-plotted metaphor about losing your virginity.The movie starts off like a fairly underwhelming high school comedy, but once we see its true nature come out in the second act, that first act starts to hit home differently, playing a part in what proves to be a hugely entertaining ride to the finish.Also, this is one of the few sequels that wants to tell a story with a little bit of fantasy mumbo-jumbo, yet doesn't expect you to take it entirely seriously. For instance, director McG knows that you don't remember all the specifics from the first movie, and so inserts brief reminders in impressively effective fashion that really help you to enjoy the story this time around.Meanwhile, the film's final act is a particular treat, as it brings together all the weird fantasy lore that these two movies have unexpectedly built up and puts a clever and surprisingly touching twist on it. It's not a work of genius, but it is a really satisfying ending to two thoroughly enjoyable movies, capping off the pair with a good sense of humour and imagination.Overall, I really liked The Babysitter: Killer Queen. Once again, it's a fun horror-comedy with entertaining action throughout and a good sense of humour. It's not meant to be taken seriously, but it also manages to engage you in its story, lore and metaphors in a way that shows it's much more than just a throwaway Netflix movie.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

53,noahgibbobaker,Awful in every respect. Do yourself a favour and never every watch it,1,20 September 2020,"There is just so much in this film I can't get into it all in this review. The babysitter: killer queen one of the most dense, poyant and beautifully crafted films I have ever seen. I will be extremely disappointed if this doesn't at least get nominated for best picture at the oscars this year. Oh... Bella Thorne is in this, never mind then it sucks.When I say ""there is just so much in this film I can't get into it"", I'm referring to the sheer amount of absolute bs. Everything makes zero sense and everything is very lazy. This movie is undeniably a cash grab. It has been realised at the perfect time though, the only way people will ever watch this is if they're stuck at home in quarantine.I'm my review of the first babysitter I wrote earlier today I mentioned how they somehow rubies queen. In the sequel they ruin them even more. Why did they need to put killer queen.Anyway here's some filmmaking and story complaints and stuff. How did Cole get away with driving Jaun's car into his house if nobody believes him about the blood cult stuff. No jail time, not even a fine, no nothing. Every single actor was awful and none of them had any chemistry. I'm an anxious, self-conscious person and I could have done a better job than everyone in this truly disgusting movie. The writing is awful, nothing makes sense, the romance is forced and most of all it's not funny in the slightest. I don't have a main issue or anything because everything is just bad, there is nothing to appreciate, even the gore was bad and that was the only saving grace of the first babysitter.Never ever watch this movie, it made me wanna slit my wrists but it also gave me hope that I could make a successful movie in about 20 minutes so that's good I guess.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

This one was ableist as hell among some other jokes and it really took away some from the film.Excluding those, this film is just as funny, campy and feel good as the first one. The Babysitter films aren't afraid to make a mockery of themselves and mock horror tropes that are consistently seen and it's a good time. I really enjoyed a lot of this and, just like the first, this could have easily been a 5/5 for it's carefree nature and watching with friends for a good time. I just wish McG could quit with the harmful jokes; we've learned more than enough this - and previous - year(s) that these can be used harmfully and it just cuts a chunk of fun out of the film",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

A great continuation of the first film that keeps the same style and tone of the original movie but has alot of great twists along the way that adds to the original and makes for a great sequel to this Franchise and honestly I enjoy it slightly more than the first.The characters in this are great and love the twists it adds to the people we see in the original.
I really like the way they handle Cole in this movie and how people don't believe him about the events in the original.
They also do a really interesting twist with Bee at the end of the movie and it's a fantastic way to add to that character and end her story.The kills are a great like the original and the gore is awesome like the original. I also really like what they add to the cult in this one it has a more supernatural feel to it in this movie and I like that a sequel should always add more to the original and this does that really well.My only negative with this movie would be again like the first sometimes the pop culture reference do go a little to far sometimes.
For example there's a fight scene that's in the style of Street Fighter and its an odd scene in my opinion that dosent really work.
There also isn't enough of Bee in the movie which is a little annoying but what they do with her is fantastic.I also really how they show the little backstories of how the people joined the group its a nice little detail we never saw in the first and adds alot to the people's characters and you understand them more because of it.It's a brilliant story that's got an awesome tone and is a great continuation of the first movie.
Some great fantastic twists along the way and honestly I enjoy it slightly more than the original it's just a fun movie and honestly I can't wait to see more of the franchise.Verdict 8.5/10 a fantastic sequel to an already great movie.
Got some fantastic twists with characters old and new and a fantastic twist with Bee that ends that character in a great way and shows more of her backstory.
A great addition to this Franchise and I can't wait to see more. I enjoy this slightly more than the original.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

66,plasticanimalz,"Following In The Footsteps of Sequels, Only A Shadow Of The Original",6,18 September 2020,"What I've learned from this is McG is a good director but he's only as good as his script. Which is why The Babysitter was a surprising, refreshing edition to the horror / comedy genre, and the sequel is kind of a let down. It has some funny moments, and McG's signature, flashy, music video style, but ultimately the plot is paper thin and all over the place, and essentially, a redo of the first movie. It's the same plot, most of the same characters, saying a lot of the same things, so, not particularly original. And the ending is cheesy and contrived. Basically, one person could write a better script in the original Babysitter, than 4 could write together in the sequel. Probably why Love & Monsters looks great, and Underwater was one of the most fun films of last year.If I was 12, maybe this would go down for me as a cult classic, but, I'm not, so, it's just kind of meh. Judah Lewis is still very likable, and the new girl, his love interest is also likable. Not as good an actress as he is, but passable, and probably early in her career. That's another thing, Samara Weaving is a good part of the first film, and she has an endearing quality, like Lewis, so, you're pulled along for the ride. Essentially, you've got Judah and a bunch of side characters to carry the film, which makes it more like occasional fun vignettes, instead of an emotional ride. It's more like Dexter Morgan, sterile, fake emotion, so, audience is left not really caring whether Judah makes it out of this film alive. But I do need to mention that John and Juan get more screen time in the sequel, and they're pretty funny.I did appreciate their Waxworks ambition, of a low budget that they make work. Like, the compositing matte scenes are pretty good for low budget. They would be garbage if this was Lord of the Rings or a big budget film, but probably most viewers wouldn't notice where scenery ends and a matte begins. The music is good...I think Bear McCreary, which did sound straight out of Halt and Catch Fire, but, hey, Paul Hasslinger doesn't get his due for a great show, so, I'm not mad at McCreary for ripping him a bit.Overall, kinda fun, just don't set your bar as high as original, and maybe don't see them close together.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

76,cscott2331,Haha. This was so stupid and fun,8,11 September 2020,"This is the cheesiest blood soaked, teen killer movie I've seen and I loved it hahaha! I mean it's an over the top fake blood, teenage virgin nerd, and all the Tagalongs, predictable slasher film. It was funny, made me laugh at the funny parts and at the blood spurting killings. I am not mad at it, no way! It's exactly what it wanted to be! Maybe even turn into a cult classic. It's primed and ready for that! Anyway, if you like my review, then watch it. I tell you all you need to know, so just sit back, chill for an hour and a half, and watch some teen slashing",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
77,maanikroda,"Man, I was disappointed by this movie.",4,11 September 2020,"I loved the first one and was ecstatic to see the sequel. Unfortunately, this movie lost nearly all the charm that made the first one so good; was riddled with plot holes; and most of all, suffered from a severe lack of Samara Weaving.LACK OF CHARM
The first film was filled with cute, gimmicky scenes (think video game style scenes). As a grown man in his late 20s, I would think it would be nearly impossible to be intrigued by a movie starring a little boy. But the charm made it happen. There was a slight sense of humor in many of the scenes and it kept the viewer interested.In this movie, however, nearly all charm was gone. Some scenes tried too hard to be charming, specifically the fight scene between the two love interests (boring). I also cringed at Phoebe's introduction scene as it felt overly forced. I can only imagine how awkward it was rehearsing that scene over and over. The entire movie was just too one-dimensional and didn't feel special like the first.PLOT HOLES
First off, the entire premise of the movie is that nobody believes Cole that the events of the first movie happened, since Bee did such a stupendous job cleaning up everything. Was everyone there ignoring the fact that Bee just disappeared? Did that not raise any flags? What about the fact that four other teenagers were gone as well as two cops? I could go on about this but it was immediately apparent that the viewer just had to accept this major flaw in order to get the sequel, I guess.Secondly, Mel going evil made no sense. Literally zero. I understand that it was supposed to be a dramatic twist, but come on. She says that she joined the cult because she ""wants to be an influencer."" Wow, how creative. We are soon after shown a scene where Bee is egging on Mel to want more and more followers, which suggests that Bee is the mastermind behind all of the cast's resurgences. Okay, that make sense. But later, it is revealed that Bee cleverly set all those people up in order to protect Cole and Phoebe. So, Bee turned Mel evil in order to save Cole and Phoebe from Mel? Makes no sense. The same applies for all the other evil characters. Bee was the instigator and also their undoing.SAMARA WEAVING
Okay, here it is. Nearly all of the reasons that the first movie was great was based on Samara Weaving playing Bee. She was this cool, slick, sexy in-charge chick. She made the first movie what it was. But in this one, she didn't really make an appearance until the final fifteen minutes and even then it was only a shell of her former self. She seemed emotionless, timid, and downright uncomfortable. It was incredibly disappointing to see such wasted potential. Perhaps most curious was how Bee was Mel's babysitter. On the one hand, it was neat how there was some explanation toward how Bee became the evil person she was, but it also felt like a giant cop out of a storyline.There are several other things wrong with this movie that I didn't get to, but the disappointment is currently overtaking me from writing anymore. Overall, there are so many other directions a sequel could have taken based on the first's ending. This movie was a C+ at best and I'd caution fans of the first to take heed when watching this, and perhaps avoid it altogether in order to maintain the integrity of the first movie.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

91,A_Llama_Drama,Not as fun the second time around,3,14 September 2020,"Killer Queen is the sort of sequel that exists to just have fun with the formula established by the original. Unfortunately, while the cast are eager to get crazy once more, the writing and direction let them down. Also, rather unfortunately, Netflix's trailer clearly gives away the twists that are to come.Cole is now an awkward teen and not a single person believes his story of that night with Bee. Not even Melanie, his first kiss and now sexpot best friend will admit to the things she saw that night. Facing a stint in a mental asylum by his worried parents (Ken Marino and Leslie Bibb, hilariously returning), Cole runs off with Melanie and her friends to a lake side party. Sadly, someone has brought back the dead and signed their name in the book of the Devil, and now Cole must fight to save himself and his friends before the sun rises.The older kids all return to reprise their roles. Each clearly having fun before being bloodily killed. There's also absolutely no denying the star power of Samara Weaving; her blue eyes, blonde hair and gaunt features in the starlight both menacing and to die for. The young cast (especially newcomers Jenna Ortega and Juliocesar Chavez) do a good job balancing horror and slapstick comedy and have the same manic energy as the originals.Sadly, the movie just can not justify itself beyond brutally murdering teens. That's all fun for a minute but when characters have the teleporting skills of Walking Dead's zombies and hearing as bad as Helen Keller, it kills the tension - each dead teen just being lined up like a lemming to be killed again. Fun montages of the original five meeting Bee for the first time pump some energy into the proceedings but it doesn't save the messy script or direction. Cole is really the weaklink. He's just not interesting enough in his trauma, and the direction offered confuses his character with being either a cold blooded killer or hapless cuckold depending on how close the villains need to get to killing him.Not a bad shout for a party horror and fun if you've nothing else to do on a Friday night,but overall falls short on a lot of fronts.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
92,bluefim,Okay to bad,3,11 October 2020,"Started out alright but the endless ""hip"" millennial references and overly flashy graphic designs kept piling up. Not sure why obviously much older actors were supposed to be only 2 years later, but it was probably part of the half-baked writing needed to bring back old characters to rehash with a few new throwaways. The ending made no damn sense in the context. Hard pass on this one unless you need something to play in the background.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
93,ryan_sy,Does't Hold Up to the First One,5,22 September 2020,"This is a fun movie that is full of small ""LOL"" moments and gore aplenty. I stopped trying to make sense of the plot after 15 minutes, and to the film's credit, it didn't try to be something its not. The dialogue between the characters is the best part of this movie. I did also enjoy the female protagonist (starred in 2nd season of ""You"") and the Dad (the always great Ken Marino). Besides that, there is not much else worth mentioning.The first movie was better for sure, and I thought it was funny that one of the characters mentioned that of all movies, there are only four sequels that are better than their original (this isn't one of them!).If you just want to experience a few laughs and light scares, then this is the movie for you.[5/10]",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

It will not win any awards but it was a fine followup. I did not see the trailers so I was not expecting the previous killers to show up. The cheese comes in when they do flashbacks on why the original characters sold their souls. Massive cheese on that, especially the black guy wanting a singing career.It has a surprise in there that you may or may not have expected from one of the original characters. The girl that he had a crush on in first movie turned out to be one of the bad guys. Maybe I was looking away when they did the flask back but I don't remember why Melanie sold her soul.

This is not a thriller and I recall no jump-scares but it was a fun, laid back movie that didn't take itself too seriously. The jokes are funny and the music is great.

105,cristinalinderman,An unnecessary sequel.,5,13 September 2020,"* There is 1 post-credit scene *The director McG and crew brought an unnecessary sequel. The first film was magnificent, I didn't expect another one and when it was announced I was kind of excited. I thought it was going to be as good but it wasn't. One of the reasons it didn't work was because they tried to do the same thing all over again and by being repetitive it felt annoying. Such a shame, I expected something different but they brought back the same level of awkwardness and the same horror clichés. It worked brilliantly the first time however the second-round felt flat. There are movies that don't need a sequel and when it gets a lot of attention they love to keep squeezing it also by doing so it damaged the original story. Even though I didn't like it, I was still entertained by a few scenes and the gore was fantastic but all I wanted was to rewatch the first film again to try to forget this one.The composer Bear McCreary brought fitting music for this movie. The kind of music that is not good nor bad it just fits well with the atmosphere.I can't say much about the cast performances due to the poor script and there were so many annoying scenes but it wasn't their fault. The one who kept it interesting was the female actor Samara Weaving and it was a shame she had a small role. Her scenes were phenomenal as ever and I would have loved if they explored more her storyline because she is the spark.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

It doesn't have the best character from the first, the title character, yet tries to fill her missing here with a similar villain that's less interesting and ruins the love storyline from the first. It loses the charm of the first film, the simplicity, which could have worked had the location been more interesting (why not the classic mall... haha). The film cruises along with no particular pace and just sort of rides smoothly to the end with few major surprises (beyond the first surprise).

110,KaZenPhi,You've been diagnosed with . . . sequelitis,5,20 February 2021,"While the first part was nothing spectacular and certainly not winning any awards for originality it was nonetheless very likeable, entertaining and at times even a little more clever than I would expect from a director like McG. Unfortunately part two throws most of it out of the window and falls for all the usual trappings of typical sequels: basically just make the same movie over again but worse and overstuffed.Everything that held the first one back from being much better is dialed up a couple of notches, be it the constant unmotivated random movie quotes and pop culture references, and the painfully unfunny quips from the bad guys. If virtually every character is hyper self-aware, random and gratingly wacky you don't have different characters, you have just one annoying one cloned over and over again. I get this is a horror comedy but if there's such a thing as a comic relief squared this is it. Sometimes less is more. I wish modern comedies knew how to write characters and when to shut up and let moments sink in for the audience. If more scenes were played straight the comedic violence and the humour would have much more impact. The gold standard for this would be Shaun of the Dead which worked both as a genuine horror movie and an inventive comedy.Of course I won't complain about the gore getting progressively over the top, it's the whole appeal of these films and the moments both shine and entertain. There's some great stuff here that would work great by itself as dark physical comedy. But again the wordy jokes sprinkled obsessively over all of it manage to drag it down. As much as the script is sabotaging them the actors are all very likeable though and play off each other well, which is the saving grace of a slightly butchered sequel. Then again I can't be too harsh with a film that uses a song from the first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.Two films is more than enough though. Nobody really needed a sequel and there are depressingly few good part 3s.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

It keeps all the things you love about the first & goes even crazier in this one! The addition of Jenna to the cast was a great casting choice. Her chemistry with Judah was perfect. I am so happy they utilised Andrew Bachelor more in this one because his comedic timing & delivery is incredible. Giving Cole's dad (Ken Marino) more scenes was a nice touch too, brilliant comedy with Chris Wylde. Hana Mae Lee didn't get as much as I would've liked but still was great in what she had. Bella Thorne is so funny in this role, I loved her news reporting back story & freak out! The deaths were so over the top it was just exactly what you want from this film! & most importantly, Samara Weaving returns with a cameo at the end that truly pushed this film from an 8 to a 9.

The story continues two years after the first Babysitter and Cole is still an outcast. Things get out of hand pretty quickly as expected. Some of the performances are great. Judah Lewis and Jenna Ortega in particular have enough chemistry and give the film a little heart when the movie takes a break from gore. There is one scene that stands out in particular with Cole and Phoebe taking a cruise on a boat at night. In this scene the cinematography, music, dialogue and performances are perfect and I wish there was more like it. The returning cast of killers all seem like they're having fun but most of them are there to be picked off in gory ways and the script does them no favors with some cringe-inducing jokes. Also most of the gore is CGI this time around so that was a little disappointing considering the original mostly avoided this. Overall, I was reasonably entertained throughout the movie but the movie is mainly let down by the script.

You'd be wrong...!!! OMG, it's like they forgot what made the first film so good... The the neighbourhood house setting, the fun supernatural theme with a bit of home alone style scripting. For those of us who grew up in the 80s and 90s that first film brought back all those first time cinema experiences, but this sequel chose to do the opposite of all that. It has a moving location which doesn't work, poor characters that you never care about, weak action sequences and pathetic production design... I am lost for words... Even the night times scenes, which is most of them, are lit up by obvious giant set lights... Are you kidding me... No time or effort was put into this script, and we all know a good film starts and ends with the story, and this was truely horrible, I can barely remember the ending... Stay clear of this one...!",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

The story was written horribly and many parts didn't make sense. It was like a bunch of ideas thrown into a hat and pieced together to try to make it work. Too many implausible and cringeworthy situations, too many forced jokes. Phoebe's introduction in class for instance, just silly. Or her taking off on a jet ski in the middle of the day and then she just so happens to show up on the boat in the middle of the night looking for gas? I had to check the run time a couple times because I was looking forward for it to just end. The whole thing is just so poorly done.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

Even though this movie only came out 3 years later the actors for melanie and cole look like they have aged 10 years or something.Anyone that's a video game fan and has played tony hawk pro skater will get a kick out of one scene like i did when one of the classic songs from the original game starts playing.I thought this movie was better than the original but after rewatching them back to back i'm not too sure which i like better.

134,MrAwesome1022,Someone Really Thought This Was A Good Idea,4,13 September 2020,"I enjoyed The Babysitter, however, The Babysitter: Killer Queen had very little in common with the first film. The issues come down to Brian Duffield not being retained as the screenwriter. The team of McG (also Director of both films), Dan Lagana, Jimmy Warden, and Brad Morris cobbled together a film full of unrelated film references and teenage sex jokes.The Babysitter wasn't a masterpiece when it came to dialogue, yet in comparison to its sequel, it looks Oscar worthy. The Babysitter: Killer Queen doesn't have anything clever, wastes money on needless graphics, and fails to deliver on narratives in the original.It's shocking the script used for the film wasn't a rough draft for a potential plot sequence. The Babysitter: Killer Queen took the worst possible narrative and turned it into a barely coherent sequel.If you are going to produce a sequel, at least keep it true to the source material. It may also be helpful to retain the individual who drafted the first screenplay.Real Score: 3.6",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

137,Fiercesome_Fool,Terrible sequel to an alright movie,4,23 September 2020,"I enjoyed the first movie well enough. I saw the trailer for this sequel and thought it looked terrible so there was no excitement. Well it was indeed terrible. They decided to go the route of making everything more outlandish than the original. It is to the point that it just felt like they were trying to hard. The dialogue is absolutely obnoxious which comes from script writers trying to force crappy jokes for the sake of jokes. I laughed maybe twice the whole movie.The cgi is awful, the acting is hammy and the plot is nonsensical. In typical Hollywood fashion they had to force in a love story between characters who know each other for a few hours.The twist at the end is absolutely pathetic and lame. Stay away from this if you liked the first movie.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

Like why didn't they end up together after the first movie? Wouldn't it have been better for them to be together in the beginning and then later he finds out she was only with him to use his blood for the ritual? That definitely would've been more interesting and a better plot twist in my opinion, but instead they gave us this rehash of the first movie. I hope there isn't a third movie...",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
139,zorrodg-316-238330,Campy fun!,6,18 September 2020,"I was not expecting to like this movie AT ALL but I have to say they really hit the mark with this one. The gore, cartoonish style and self-awareness of the first are back and turned up to 11.While there are a few lapses in logic (i.e. how old is Cole supposed to be? He says he's a junior but was 12 in the first film and it's been two years since that?) the infectious energy of this flick reels you in and the violence and plot become so outrageously cartoonish that you can't help but turn the brain off and lean into the fun. This flick is like a live action road runner cartoon at points and that is not a knock against the movie whatsoever.The returning cast is as good as they were the first go-round, and McG's flair for over-the-top style for styles sake keeps the film chugging along at a steady pace.At the end of the day, if you liked the first, you'll probably dig this follow up.

It was cheesy and predictable.I didn't mind the ending so much. But the fact bee was hardly in the movie and then shows up a brand new person bothered me. We get one line of explanation ""you changed me that night"" or whatever the line was. A cheap copout to subvert expectations, although they really didn't because you could see that coming a mile away.He didn't really change her though, did he? She gave up her soul in the first place just to save Pheobe. Maybe it could've been that he reminded her of who she really was? Okay I know, I'm knit picking now. A better backstory to what made her give up her evil ways would've been appreciated.A lot bothered me about this movie. And even more made me cringe. I watched it all because I hate leaving a movie unfinished, but I didn't enjoy it. I felt the need to fast forward through certain parts.

I am a teacher in Germany. If i had kids like these, i would have called the parents and the psychiatrist a long time ago. What the hell!!!

If you liked the first instalment, you're going to consider this to be a great treat. Critics hate the film (as they do most films of its style and genre) for the same reasons fans love it. It's packed with crude and vulgar comedy, unfiltered gore, racial and sexist stereotypes and does a great job of following up on the storyline while leaving an open book to a third instalment.
Don't let critics and the occasional scathing user review deter you. This type of comedy has a job which is to establish the line of what is acceptable humour, get right up to the line, walk it and barely teeter of the edge. To a critic who prefers the oscar nominated material and to a sensitive viewer, the comedy and themes will be to much and downright offensive. To the rest of us (who are the majority) this is about as satisfying as a sequel could possibly be.I'll be eagerly awaiting more from the whole production crew and crossing my fingers that they make this into a trilogy!",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

What is missed is Samara Weaving, who appears but little, the little friend (also older) Emily Alyn Lind from Doctor Sleep plays her replacement and Jenna Ortega (from the 2nd of YOU Netflix) joins, as a companion of misadventures .
Returns to direct McG and manages to entertain with funny and humorous moments typical of pastist comedy, a class b horror movie tone and tons of blood (even in impossible moments like a hemoglobin splash from under the water!) of the gore cinema.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

The movie is filled with unnecessary edits/effects, useless conversations, way too much songs, and dumb jokes (and not even funny ones). All of these just function as a layer to hide how bad most of the scenes are. If you'd remove everything I just mentioned from the scenes they appear in, you'd end up with bollocks (because the acting is just as bad).

Babysitter 1 had paid genuine homage to pop culture and 80s movie nostalgia and fandom, and a intelligent script; Killer Queen leaned way too heavily on recycled jokes, references to 80s horror/movie references, cross-generational rivalry between zoomers and millenials, and using of the word ""bitch"" as often as your uncle steps outside for a smoke break at the family Christmas party. Judah Lewis stood out as a young actor with great potential in Babysitter 1, but in this one he seemed outperformed by both his awkward laugh over the delivery of his lines and busy cast list. Jenna Ortega's character seems injected for no reason other than to drive the sequal's plot, and cannot justify its existence, and not much more than a back door to connect Samara Weaving to the sequel. Pair this with her breathy speaking and melodramatic acting, and it becomes angsty and tired. Practical effects are used sparingly, but when they are they make the visuals look great...until the CGI ruins it. Overall, it's a true-to-the-first sequel, but does the first a disservice.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
162,kxprailer,"Exactly what I wanted it to be, and somehow better than the first!",6,10 September 2020,"MAJOR SPOILERS (possibly, I might do this spoiler free but be warned anyway) AHEAD BECAUSE I NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!I rated the original Babysitter movie a 7/10 because I love the look and feel that director McG was going for. Stylized sequences, crazy gore and hilarious comedy. The Babysitter is one of Netflix's best movies and it's a highly enjoyable dark comedy that when I first watched it, the twist early on had my jaw on the floor. The kills were great, and the movie had a good overall message, and a unique execution to it.When I saw the trailer for this sequel I was immediately excited, but there was no news of Samara Weaving's return so I was worried it wouldn't be as good without her charismatic personality. Boy was I wrong. This movie is twice what the original was, in the best way!The Babysitter: Killer Queen was better than the first. With twice the gore and kills, twice the hilarious comedy, and about 3x more McG stylization.NEGATIVES: The bits with Cole and Melanie's dads were easily the most annoying. But even those after a while weren't so bad and were pretty enjoyable and kinda heartwarming. All the things I thought were going to be annoying here ended up making me laugh even harder than they did the first time, the movie is a little slow and awkward to start and I got worried it was just gonna repeat itself and feel like the same movie.POSITIVES: this movie doubles down on all the things that made the original so damn enjoyable for me. The kills were more creative and much more graphic and shocking, some of which leaving my jaw dropped. The practical gore in this movie is insane, and when there IS some CGI it's not horribly done.With the characters from the first film returning, we get even more cringy hilarious dialogue between them, but I just love how they all experience the same stuff as before. This movie is self aware in the perfect way, retrospectively.
The new character played by Jenny Ortega was the best part in my opinion. A complex but really sweet new love interest for Cole. The bond the two had was a really good emotional backbone for the second half of the film, and it lead to a hilarious climax twist at the end.
The whole cast absolutely kills it in this movie, I was laughing, cheering, and smiling wide for most of the movie's runtime.Those who only wanted Samara Weaving back won't be entirely disappointed, as she serves quite a huge part in this movie too, she's just in it less. But spending time with Andrew Bachelor and Bella Thorne is NOT a bad time. They may be a little annoying and obnoxious, but it's written in such a tongue in cheek way, it's so hard not to enjoy this movie's style.And speaking of style, McG directs the hell out of this movie. A great location, great camerawork, great pacing, and of course, a whole heap of on screen stylized sequences that are nothing but tons of fun to watch. This movie literally becomes a video game at one point, also the addition of short little skits on how they came to be part of Bee's cult are pretty hysterical and clever.This movie is way more clever than the more average and predictable predecessor. I literally had no idea what would come next, and it ended up surprising me repeatedly. I had an absolute blast with this movie, and while I feel a 3rd chapter is unnecessary, I am NOT opposed to McG continuing the great work he has going here.Also the soundtrack is killer as well.This is an honest 7.5-8/10 for me, I was really worried going into this movie but I was far from disappointed. I know not everyone will be on board with the changes here, but if you're like me and enjoyed the original for what it was and love when directors experiment, you'll love this movie!",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

Some ideas about the supporting characters are mostly underdeveloped. The story in itself isn't as naturally progressing, coherent and well paced as in the original or even good. However, the movie has more laugh out loud moments than the first one. The one liners and situational comedy are actually better. The ending is satisfying in its own merit.

But for a good time, maybe with a few drinks, having a good laugh with friends, yeah it wasn't bad. I watched the first one way back when, and that one wasn't bad at all, I actually liked it. This sequel was very wack, the plot was really vague and horrible, serious points would come out of nowhere and it was just all over the place. They basically just assumed you'd understand everything... which I didn't. If you didn't watch the first one you will know nothing throughout this movie. Good comedy though throughout, as long as you're like 18, you might get a few laughs. The acting surprising wasn't terrible, I've seen worse, but the good acting only came from like a few characters. Don't know if I'd watch again though, I'd watch the first one again, this one... not so much. However, some funny scenes mixed in with funny actors made this one not too bad as long as you are not sober. Try to ditch the fact that the plot is vague and that people are dying left and right for no reason. Just enjoy, try to have a few laughs, and have a good time.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
175,new-44281,No shirts needed for this wonderful sequel.,8,17 September 2020,"The Babysitter was such a great out of the box thinking comedy horror movie. When the sequel was announced I cringed. Most don't compare to the original, how lucky we are this one is it's own Terminator 2!With a returning cast, writer and director there wasn't an odd turn from the chemistry that made the first movie such a fun watch.Seeing our main character, Cole, grown up a bit, and a couple years down the road from the Devils night is really great. Judah Lewis ""Cole"" remains loveable, awkward and heroic.
Jenna Ortega plays ""Phoebe"" a new character that is a wonderful addition and key component to the film.
Storyline is excellent, the gore, the laughs and fun moments are plentiful.
Anyone that's given this a poor rating is simply angry with life. lol",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
176,abimbolamariam,Definitely not as good as the first movie!,5,13 September 2020,The biggest problem was the fact that Bee didn't play a big role in this movie. What made the babysitter one better was that bee was an antagonist and we constantly saw her. In this one she is seen in tiny clips and a boring ending. The new characters were boring and unnecessary. I was honestly glad to see the old characters.,The Babysitter - Killer Queen

178,austinbmoney,Not as Good as the First Movie,5,10 November 2020,"While this film is inferior to the first, it does have its moments of fun. Much like the first film, one of the things that this movie does really well is comedy. There are some really funny jokes and scenes. However, the new bad guys that are introduced in this film do take away from the humor by being terribly unfunny. Luckily they are killed off fairly quick, so they don't end up being too much of a problem. Another thing that is pretty good, much like the first film, is the CGI and practical effects. Much of the gore and bloodshed in the movie is done through practical effects, and looks realistic for the most part. There is one scene however, where a character has their head ripped off, and it looks painfully fake, and sort of ruins what would have otherwise been a pretty good scene. There are a few glaring flaws with the film too, one of which is the overall plot and its execution. It basically recycles the exact same plot from the first film, and the only real difference is that there are more bad guys this time around. It really shows a lack of creativity, and it can also be really sloppy at times. The film is also directed by McG, who is notoriously known for taking interesting concepts and ideas, and making subpar films out of them.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

Bella Thorne and Robbie Amell are particularly good fun although surely the latter should be getting more opportunities to play an adult by now.
Like others have said, the twist of having the main characters best friend from the first film be the big bad kind of spits in the face of the original and it feels like there is a lot of plot filler. Also the fact that the main boy (can't remember his name) has lost all the courage he built in the first film feels like a back step.Certainly not terrible but inferior to the first one which I found to be a lot of fun.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

addition to the plot and personal I think that Phoebe and Cole are cutter then Cole and Melanie I am happy that the parents got more screen time to know them better +Melanie's Dad is hilarious
And Jenna Ortega is a great actrice that got a bright future and I really wish all the best for her and not ending up like Miley Cyrus or other actrice

'The Babysitter: Killer Queen,' is truly a guilty pleasure that mixes the recipe up just enough to make it fun. I won't bore you with the esoteric nonsense. The plot is familiar.

Brief cutaways to familiar song & dance routines were kinda' cool.

205,johnbthomasiii80,Just not very good,5,12 September 2020,"The Babysitter was such a fun and unexpected pleasure that you will want to like it's sequel. In fact, I was eagerly awaiting it. It's a shame it doesn't offer the same guilty pleasures. There are a few shining lights among the disappointing film: Judah Lewis as the beleaguered lead does his best with a script that is pitifully weak. Robbie Amell brings energy to his character once again and Samara Weaving still lights up the screen in her cameo performance. While the cast has expanded to almost double - it isn't double the pleasure.It's still full of pop references as was the first, but they must have determined that the audience for the original had skewed much older than intended because the references are aimed at Baby Boomers not younger people. In one scene a boat named ""Jenny"" requires a code to start it. Immediately I knew it would be 867-5309 and I was correct. That's the thing about this film; there are no surprises. The script is predictable and you can anticipate the location of a joke AND even what the joke will be.Now to be clear the acting throughout is competent given the phoned in direction and script. But the quirky characters that appeared in the first film are relegated to the background as a set of new and completely uninteresting generic characters are given a bit of screen time. Their existence were completely unnecessary and I can think of a couple of ways to have written the same script without them.Shame. I really like the first film and the characters. This is an insult to them and the actors who play them.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

When the horror and action started at the island it became very repetitive and boring in parts. The end was quite good I loved the last scene. Judah Lewis and the cast were fantastic and the soundtrack was great aswell. Unfortunately Act 2 of the film was quite a poor, repetitive showing. Even a road trip would have made the movie much stronger the one island location in the dark was just pretty dull and boring no interesting scenery or locations once that begun.

Also, I loved when great music tracks popped in at the perfect time during this movie. Like most people said about the original, this is a mix of comedy, horror, action, etc etc... It's quite a unique movie. If you enjoyed the original in the slightest bit... you have to see this one. In my opinion it outdoes the original and even makes it better.

214,haydentheroadhogmain,The long anticipated sequal to the fantastic Babysitter movie,7,11 September 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Babysitter Killer Queen is the long awaited sequal to the horror comedy film The Babysitter way back from 2017, this one is a little bit more focused on the comedy side than the horror side. It tells the story of Cole a couple years later being labeled as a crazy kid because police did not find evidence about the incident 2 years ago, the only person that talks to him normally is Melanie but she denies all the killings and kinda just wants to forget about them, when his parents decide to take him to a psychological highschool he takes up Melanie's offer of going away to the lake for a week with her and her friends only to find out that the cult that he killed back then are back for his blood. Now I don't think this sequal is as good as the original, but I don't think the film is bad in its own right, it does have a lot more comedy than horror tho, the kills are still gory, the references, funny humor and the elements that made the first movie great are still here. I didn't really like the Melanie twist, it was just so out of place for me that she suddenly is a part of the cult and it kinda threw me off, and the ending I still don't know if I like it, we get Bee back and she apparently set up everything so Phoebe can be safe, and everything looks good, now I think there might be a sequal, but I personally think that this a good enough place to wrap up this franchise, if they make a sequal it has to be really creative since they killed off the favorite characters from the previous movies, they might even go for satan is going after Cole, even tho that kinda feels too extreme, but hell this entire franchise is crazy. The pacing felt a little bit rushed to me, since the plot conveniences just progressed the story really fast, it felt like everything that needed to happen just happened, like I don't actually think grooming Cole to get cornered again is that easy, but hey they made it happen I guess.
Pros:
-Still funny, gory and a lot of great pop culture references
-Returning characters made the movie great
-We get to see what happens if the ritual is completed and that was kinda epic if only they had the blood of the innocent
-Samara Weaving returns at the end as Bee
-Very self aware
-Its influence is in full swing
-Very entertaining
Cons:
-Too much plot convenience
-The ending and the Melanie twist are still meh for me
-Pacing wasn't great
-First part of the movie was lame as hell
Overall Babysitter Killer Queen is a pretty decent sequal, I still think it relies way too much on plot convenience, since without it doesn't get going, but it does maintain the humor and the other elements that made the first one great, while being inferior to it unfortunately. This film was also really enjoyable and funny to watch, and I would recommend it to horror fans out there. Imma give Babysitter Killer Queen a 7/10 for its overall movie rating.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
215,cole_groth,"Flawed, but beautiful.",7,12 September 2020,"Let me preface this review by pointing out that this movie has tons of flaws. Some of the performances are awful (*cough* Bella Thorne *cough*), some of the special effects are seriously iMovie level, and the dialogue is some of the cheesiest I have heard in a while. Despite all of these flaws, I could not stop myself from loving this movie. Judah Lewis, Jenna Ortega, and Emily Alyn Lind are spectacular as Cole, Phoebe, and Melanie, respectively. Their performances take this whole movie to a whole new level. What I really loved about this movie is the romantic subplot. I honestly wish that we could get an entire movie about Judah Lewis and Jenna Ortega falling in love, because their relationship felt so genuine. The movie loves to be very real, and I loved how McG handled their relationship. The music is phenomenal, which is to be expected from this director. I thought that the ending was beautiful, and seeing B sacrifice herself for Cole and Phoebe was a uniquely satisfying ending. I didn't watch the first film, but I watched the Kill Count video which went in-depth about it. From what I can tell, this is an improvement on all fronts. I guess I just have to accept some times that a film with a lower quality in terms of production can get higher ratings on my list, as long as it has a lot of heart. The movie tries a lot, and it is very funny at times. It does a decent job with the horror-comedy genre, using an extremely dark tone, with tons of gore, while also being light and playful at the same time. I think that this tone went great with developing the relationship between Cole and Phoebe, because it mirrors, at times, a real high school relationship. A third movie was teased at the end of the credits, and if the next movie doesn't take itself too seriously, just like this film, then I will be extremely happy with the product. This movie is just too much damn fun to pass up, and is one of my favorite horror-comedies to date.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
216,genlovell,Satisfactory sequel to The Babysitter,8,15 September 2020,"This movie ended the story on a positive note and I am satisfied with how things turned out. It left off a bit open ended and some questions are left unanswered. For instance, how the blood cult was formed, why did Melanie make a deal with the devil, what was the ultimate goal of the cult, and more.I enjoyed watching the development of Cole from being a cowardly middle school student to a confident high school student. The introduction of a new character, Phoebe intrigued me the moment she stepped into the classroom. I think she complemented Cole's character very well as their past is somewhat similar. As in, they both had ""killed"" people.What is different with the sequel from the prequel is that there is more gore and you get to know the characters a little more. What is the same is that, the comedy is still strong on this one and maybe I cracked more laughs at the remarks and antics.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

218,brendanjames97,Well..... This film exists so here's a review,3,13 September 2020,"I had no idea this film had even began or finished filming the making of this was very quiet one of the actors revealed that it was coming out this September and we got one trailer now here it, let me just say I really enjoyed the first one it was funny, violent and really enjoyableThis film has some enjoyment sprinkled throughout but it is such a mess of a film that tries so hard to make it work without Samara weaving for literally the entire film she shows up 20 minutes before the end and is only on screen for about 10 minutes, with a twist that honestly if I explained everything I'd be here all day it just ridiculous how much of her plan was solely based on absolute luck, like literally there's no way what she planned would ever go down in the exact way it did.As a sequel it really does make the first film feel kinda pointless at the end, Bella Thorne is annoying as hell in this one, the rest of the cast did good with what they were given but honestly given how long it's been since the first I was hoping for a lot more but it seems as though they didn't have a clue what to do with this so now we have killer queen it's really disappointing I gave it chance especially considering negative things about it but yeah I should have listened to the critics despite laughing at a few things there's not much in this that's memorable, here's hoping Netflix puts their money into something better next time or spend more time actually focusing on an idea that works not just throw anything you can at the screen until you have a movie that feels rushed but kinda boring at the same time",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

221,roel-willemsen,Deliberately and dramatically over the top.,6,10 September 2020,"Just like its predecessor, The Babysitter: Killer Queen is a not so subtle and over the top horror/comedy. From absurd death scenes, an overabundance of fake blood and comical overacting, it has all the ingredients for a parody. The movie features all sorts of clichés as well, including a group of horny teenagers and even a secluded cabin at the end, and at times it is done well.The plot is quite generic, with our leading man, Cole (Judah Lewis), again finding himself hunted by a teenage killer cult.
Horror movie sequels often thread on familiar ground, but seldom is a follow-up so similar to its predecessor. Again Cole flees, hooks up with a down-to-earth girl, and manages to take his adversaries out in grisly / ridiculous ways.
A few problems I had were mainly related to some of the plot developments. One of these was that Melanie (played by a not so convincingly sadistic Emily Alyn Lind) was suddenly the bad guy without any character development leading up to that.
Besides that, we did see the return of the previous movie's bad guys (Bella Thorne, Robbie Amell, Hana Mae Lee and Andrew Bachelor). They all died gruesome deaths in the previous movie, and yet have somehow been allowed to return. The explanation for this was given in a throwaway line.
Now, I won't lie and say that these characters aren't probably the most amusing parts of the movie. All four are ridiculously over the top, which can either be amusing or annoying depending on one's taste. A special nod to Amell, who kept his weird but funny bromance with Cole going and even applauded him at several points.
One last problem was the return of the previous main baddy, Bee (Samara Weaving), who was instead suddenly turned into a literal guardian angel. Her plan, which is absolutely ridiculous, had some major holes in it which everyone just glosses over. Also, Cole seems to have totally forgotten by the end how Bee had spent the previous movie trying to literally blow his brains out.For me, the best part about the movie were the interactions between leads Cole and Phoebe (played by a delightfully charming Jenna Ortega). These two had legitimate chemistry, and gave the otherwise totally insane movie some more grounded moments.All in all, it's a solid sequel which I enjoyed more than the original. The plot is the main problem, due to it being generic and nonsensical at times. The actors did a solid job, with Lewis, Ortega and Amell being the standouts in my opinion. Horror comedies are rarely cinematic gold, and should just be watched to amuse oneself. Now, this movie is definitely amusing, but I wouldn't go as far as to call it good.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

For our main boy to get some action and kind of end his story in a more consistent way. Other than that this is one of the most forgettable movies I have seen in a long time. Just let it play in the background while you do something else like maybe watch actual P*rn.
A 5/10 for me just cause I love the characters, otherwise would have been a 3/10.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
227,Carpy-96811,"Not nearly as good as the first, but still entertaining.",5,20 September 2020,"I was pretty disappointed in this film because I LOVED the first one. I enjoy horror comedies and thought the first Babysitter film was seriously underrated. To me, this sequel was trying too hard and become a little too ridiculous at times. It didn't flow as well as the first one and had some truly cringe worthy moments. It was still entertaining and worth the watch. There were a few good twists along the way. I was honestly REALLY upset that they made his neighbor that was so sweet in the first movie end up evil in this one though.....I could have done without that. It just didn't seem believable that she would have changed that much in such a short amount of time without any reasonable explanation.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
228,cameronwhiteboy,"Good Sequel, Average Movie",6,16 September 2021,"Yeah, you need to watch the first one. It does an okay job of filling you in if you're just jumping straight in but I still wouldn't recommend that path. Especially since the first film is better.Don't get me wrong, I liked the first one. And if you liked the first one then you'll still enjoy the second one. However if you really didn't like the first one then stay the hell away from the second one!The Scott Pilgrimish vibe from the first film is still there but in a much smaller dose. Almost like they forgot about it halfway through the movie.Seeing the characters from the first film just come back was really deflating after all the hard work we put into killing them.Nevertheless, their performances are decent with Robbie Amell stealing the win in funniest but also most likeable bad guy.Netflix unfortunately can't help themselves but stick their politics into the film. I wish they realised that the first movie's popularity was helped by the fact that they kept their forced agenda out of it. There's not too much of it but enough for you to roll your eyes.The twists and turns are enough for loyal viewers but also leave us wondering... What are they going to do for a third movie? As I believe McG confirmed a sequel. And if so, they need to move on from this cast to progress the story but it's also the cast it's audience has fallen in love with. What a pickle.Overall, it's a bit of fun with solid over the top gore that will keep you guessing. If you do guess the ending before it happens then well done to you because I didn't.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

I especially appreciated the detail that went into the scene building; I felt the background had as many jokes as what was happening in the foreground. Is it sophisticated? No. But what did you expect? I'd compare it to tucker & dale vs evil: it might not be particularly high brow, but it plays with loads references, and I was entertained from beginning to end. If you like gory horror that doesn't take it itself too seriously, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. I'd give it 7/10, but it gets a +1 because the current rating is so low.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

It has nothing to do with the original, it looks like a mix of Quentin Tarantino and Tim Burton, and not in a good way. It is unbelievable to see that the director of the two films is the same. Because the first is a good film, well shot and fun. This film, however, is one of the worst things I've ever seen. Well, I say I saw it, but the truth is that I skipped several parts, watched halfway and then I couldn't take it: I skipped to the finale to end my torment.

252,crazykittieboy,One of the best black comedies of the last decade.,9,24 September 2020,"I am absolutely shocked to see the reviews of this film. I can only believe that people watched an entirely different movie, or took the first movie as anything more than a campy comedy satire.You can tell the script writers are absolute lovers of the Evil Dead series. In many ways, Babysitter: Killer Queen is the Evil Dead 2 of the franchise. Those that liked the horror aspect of the Evil Dead series more will always prefer the original and find the second to be a near identical comedy which is far inferior in every way. If you loved Evil Dead 2 more than you loved Evil Dead, it is my guess that you will actually like The Babysitter: Killer Queen better than the original.If you are a fan of Evil Dead 2, go into it knowing that it has shed its horror elements completely to go full on camp.I felt the exact same way about The Babysitter: Killer Queen as I did the Babysitter, for its first 20 minutes. I thought: This movie is going to suck. However, neither of those things are detriments to the movie. It makes the ""kick start"" of the film that much more random and absolutely hilarious. I got a pretty good chuckle when The Babysitter kicked off with its first death. This film outdoes that by 100,000. The single first death scene alone is worth watching this film. It is by all accounts the ""Ash bobbing with the lamp and laughing with the deer head"" scene from Evil Dead 2. And the laughs just keep on coming.It is almost essential to watch the first movie and then watch this, within a short time frame. If you barely remember the first movie, many of the jokes will fly over your head. It is an absolute laugh fest of the lowest brow.I rarely make reviews for films, usually when I feel the people have gotten it completely wrong. I have seen plenty of half baked praise attempts. There are lots of critiques written by individuals who do not understand the camp genre. This movie will be hated and then loved. This is a Cult Classic in the making. I will only say this: Give the film a chance, and watch both movies back to back.Forgive what feels like plot holes, too. Because, I dont think they actually are plot holes at all. This is the part where I will get into the sad truth of the world. Many do not believe that nobody would believe what happened to him happened to him. However, during the Satanic Panic in Europe, there were instances where there was so much evidence of something occurring, and yet people still did not believe it occurred. When people refer to satanic occultic stuff, it is absolutely dismissed, regardless of evidence. Not to mention, in this world, Satan is real, and if Satan is real, he controls the realm, thus ""cops werent found dead"" and stuff makes sense within the context. It is absolutely setting up for its ""Army of Darkness"" finale, and I absolutely hope that comes to fruition.A single point off for the cringeworthy cutaways. They are all but 10 seconds and there might be four of them, but when i own the film im definitely gonna personally cut those out for home views. Great film, perfect shlock camp, absolutely hilarious, 9/10",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

255,dontscrewupp,It's wonderful!,8,12 November 2020,"This is a 2020 movie, intended for 2020 audience. There going to be things included in this film that might be relevant now, but might get irrelevant as it grows older. So watch out people of the future, it's not time proof and frankly it doesn't even try to be.Still, The Babysitter: Killer Queen manages to even top the first film, which was one of my favorite films of all times.All of your favorite characters come back alongside new ones. The new characters are not given that much screen time but it's fine. I didn't care about them much in the first place, and I wanted to see more from the original cast.This movie is so unimaginably campy, to a ridiculous level sometime, might I add, but still has it's scary and gruesome moments.It's also pretty unpredictable. I was pretty engaged and was thinking ""oh I hope they do this and that"" regarding some plot points.Judah Lewis as Cole did an incredible job, he's very talented and his acting was great. He carried this film the same way he carried the first. I loved the direction they went with his character. Despite this film being so unbelievably over the top, what they decided to do with the character was a pretty realistic choice and I think it paid off.I also enjoyed Jenna Ortega as Phoebe, I think that she too did a fantastic job and I found her very likable.Robbie Amell as Max. Lets just say, I don't ever want to see Max with a shirt on. Okay?Samara Weaving as Bee... I mean, she's just perfect. A whole another level. I loved her so incredibly much in the first film, and her arc in this sequel is so incredibly satisfying.I don't want to spoil anything, but the movie does have a theme going on and I think the theme matches the film perfectly.If you watched the first movie, and loved Bee and Cole as much as I do, I don't care what anyone else is telling you. This movie is a must!",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

A bit over the top (exaggerated at times), but having Weaving (Bee) back was great. She is becoming real Horror Queen! Thorne (not too shabby in horrors either!) was also great! Soooooo cheesy!

Super funny and excellent kills/deaths haha.I didn't even know they made a sequel until a few days ago, and I wasn't sure what to expect, I liked the first one, so I figured this would be good too, so I didn't read any reviews or watch the trailer first purposely.And again just finished it and wow that was awesome! This is one the best sequels AND movies ever made in my opinion. I was laughing almost the entire movie, I'm not even kidding haha!I have no Idea how this doesn't have a higher rating on here, but then again yes I do, I never trust ratings on here they are always wrong. I just watched a different ""comedy horror"" movie yesterday (that I will not name), had a similar rating to this but it just SUUCCCKKKEEDD lol.I think this movie at minimum should be an 8 on here, but in my personal opinion it's a 10 as it's perfect (and I never put 10's).

It was clearly a fluke, and in their attempt to recreate the magic, they failed absolutely.They bring back dead characters from the first movie, and even redo jokes from the first movie. It's honestly very trashy. There are very few redeeming qualities about this movie in anyway. They took the superficial charms that HELPED make the magic from the first movie go from good to amazing. But that's like taking the rims and flashy lights off of a tricked out car and putting them onto a garbage car from the junkyard and calling it good. It isn't good.

I loved it for the ending, the interaction between the characters like Cole and the old minions of B which were always funny moments, I had to keep rewinding and watching parts over because they were so beautifully acted. I also liked that Cole's main storyline was a lot like Harry Potter from the OOTP -that no one believed him- and I enjoyed the twists that happened throughout the story.I will say I think the new minions were unnecessary overall, but then again they needed to be there to bring the old ones back at first and there wasn't much of them in the movie to take away from it, so it wasn't anything bad. Also the part where the old minions and new ones are arguing was funny so it was worth it.Phoebe was a great addition and really love-able.Cole and the original minions had really great chemistry. They played really well off each other. Their interactions felt really genuine. Amazing acting from all of them.I would definitely recommend. 10/10",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

It was still a fun watch though. Good to see the original cast return and a decent twist near the start.Recommend 8/10",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
288,bpkazar-366-30661,I Was Looking Forward To This One,4,12 September 2020,"It's been years since I saw the first film, but when I heard they were making a sequel, I knew I wanted to watch it. I even defended the trailer, saying it might not be that bad. I was wrong.Cons:
The dialogue itself is awkward, mostly unnecessary, and simply unfunny. There was a scene or two with Robbie Amell's character that I can think of that were mildly funny for me.For some reason, the kills were almost all similar in nature (you'll get what I mean once you watch the movie). They were ""cool"", but felt uninspired as well.The editing in a particular scene didn't make sense to me, and took away from the progression of the story. There was a voiceover of a previous scene taking place during an action sequence. That was, in my opinion, a big low point in the movie.Once Samara Weaving made a brief appearance, I had already mostly lost interest. I agree with other reviewers that said her character had basically become a hull of what she was, and that her role in the story really didn't make sense. Once she's there, it didn't really matter that much anyways to me.I didn't care for so many pop culture references. It took away from the humor for me.Pros:
The acting wasn't bad. There was nothing exceptional about it, but it wasn't awful either.I think my favorite part about the film was the location. That's really the biggest redeeming quality for me.I can't think of anything else off the top of my head.Maybe I expected too much, but I ended up being disappointed in the end.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

This movie goes right along with the first one, it has comedy, it has gore, it has family feud/love/heart, and above all, it has this poetic sense of realization at the END! If you enjoyed the first movie, you'll love this one. Ignore bad reviews! This one cracked me up more than the first one and it also has so much more emotion into the twist. It sums up the ""why"" of the first movie. If you are someone that has watched the first movie and ever wondered ""why would someone care for someone so much and then try and kill them?""

317,missmagnetz,DO NOT WATCH IF YOU LIKE THE ORIGINAL,3,11 September 2020,"Don't get me wrong, the babysitter is one of my favorite movies of all time. but this was... incredibly hard to watch. it just sucked so bad. from the incessant 2019-2020 pop culture throwaway lines to the horrendous expansion in world, i truly disliked this film. about 20 minutes in, i knew that a tiger king reference was bound to happen at some point. still, my soul was incredibly crushed when it happened. all of the first movie's wit is replaced with cheap and honestly confusing lines like ""he's the channing tatum of killing people"". wtf does that mean? everything that made the babysitter great is now done in excess, making a sad parody of what was a really great film. funny bits from the original are played out and the overall reliance on such callbacks is tiring and cringeworthy to watch. all of the new characters are uninteresting and under-developed and all of the original interesting side characters (cole's parents, melanie's dad, etc) have an unwarranted amount of screen-time in which they fail to become more likeable or funny. the unnessesary amount of new characters is alienating to fans and the decision to move cole outside of his life/microcosm and into the ""real world"" is unnerving. it's so clear that without bee, the story falls apart. her charm is completely absent and the lack of a complex and lovable central relationship (bee and cole) is painstakingly apparent. even the font change (a very bold choice), is completely wrong for the film. the 80s slasher aesthetic of the first movie is symbolically reduced to that of a cheap 2000s remake. i honestly really wish i hadn't watched this movie. if you like the original babysitter, please BEWARE!!! truly disappointing. +1 star for cool deaths",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

That, I thought they had changed the director, but I see that it is the same, I think I really did not want to make this film, the humor is poor, the performances are exaggerated and it does not manage to convey the suspense of the first, the big surprises of the film They are ridiculous and without any explanation, in the lake scene when it is discovered that his friend betrayed him there, they were able to rebuild the path and bring us that suspense and action from the first one, but they decide to go for the comedy, really the only character and arc that ok is Jenna Ortega's, but the rest is very bad",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

365,Misharinn,Such a good sequel,8,21 September 2020,"The first part was funny and somewhat new, but this one is a on a new level. They really worked on shortcomings of the first one. Bigger budget, bigger scenes, still funny jokes. It's just fun and entertaining. The movie really delivers on what it's supposed to",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
366,Colinpc28,Good but she's trying too hard to be Bee,7,13 September 2020,It was good but Melanie was trying wayyyyy too hard to act just like Bee in the original,The Babysitter - Killer Queen
367,andrew_broadbent,Mindless Horror at its finest,9,12 September 2020,"When you're in the mood for something, but you sit there, scrolling through Netflix's options, unable to decide - don't scroll past this movie.Yes - it's stupid
Yes - it's mindless
Yes - it doesn't hold back from the gore
Yes - it's funny as hell
Yes - there's eye candy for the ladies
Yes - there's also eye candy for the men! (#equality)But all these points make it a damn good movie when you want to forget reality for a while and laugh at the camp one-liners and classic horror references.
And then if you're a sucker for sappiness- there's even love",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
368,TheGreaterPower,The sequel is watchable but seems to rely more on humour than horror,5,20 July 2021,"Sequels can be a hit or miss,this sequel isn't a complete miss but it's neither a hit. While the 1st film did have some humour,the tone of the film was quite dark. The sequel seems to rely on humour more than horror.The lack of screen time from Samara Weaving (Bee) hurts the film,while she does appear in flashbacks (new footage) she does finally show up towards the end of the film but by that time not even her character can save the film.The film ends with a tease of a possible sequel,if there was a 3rd film i'd go back to the tone of the 1st film.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
369,coolizak,Better than first one,10,11 September 2020,Good gore and very funny. I loved it. If you liked the first one youre gonna love this.,The Babysitter - Killer Queen
370,nb3d,Is it The English Patient? No. Is it *supposed to be*?...Also no.,9,11 September 2020,"So, right out the gate, I admit: I'm a total mark for this movie. The first one was one of the most pleasant surprises in the comedy-horror sub genre of all time, in my opinion. It caught me totally off guard, was released with next-to-no fanfare, and when I first watched it, I knew I was seeing something special: a movie that sneaks up out of nowhere and knocks my horror-loving-socks-off. It was BRILLIANTLY scripted, cast, paced, and executed (no pun intended. Ok, slightly intended.)When I found out about a sequel? I was pretty much sold from the word ""go."" BUT, that's not to say I don't have my qualms. I'll try to avoid outright spoilers, but here are a few nit-picky problems I had with the underlying premise for the sequel:So our tale begins with hapless Cole being viewed as a cuckoo bird because everybody believes the entire ordeal from the first movie was a delusion.Now, look: I know the movie isn't meant to be Citizen Kane, and suspension of disbelief is important when watching brain-candy movies like this (even though, as brain candy goes, both Babysitter films have WAY smarter dialogue and humor than they have any right to, but I digress,) my problem, from a plot standpoint, is a relatively glaring one:Why does no one find it strange that Cole's babysitter, on whom Cole correctly blamed the entire massacre, is nowhere to be found afterward? What about the nerd they sacrificed at the beginning of the ritual? What about the other cult members? What about the POLICE OFFICERS WHO GOT MURDERED? I literally just went back and checked: after they kill the cops, Bee makes Cole give the dispatchers the code for ""all clear."" The dispatcher initially says ""what's the status of that 187 (homicide) call on Bigby Drive?""I mean, c'mon. Those officers were *documented*, *dispatched* to Cole's house to investigate a murder, were then summarily executed, never to be seen nor heard from again. Cole later recounts the entire story to the authorities with Bee, the entire cult, two police officers, and a nerdy high school/college student ALL missing without a trace- but everybody is stone cold certain that Cole is nuts? His parents included? Even though they've MET Bee? Like dozens of times? Did they not think it was weird that she abandoned their son while she was supposed to be babysitting him? lolAnyway. End rant. That's just the one thing I had a hard time getting over. It was almost distracting how much of a plot hole it was. And for such an otherwise well-written movie, it seems like it wouldn't have been that hard to write this sequel more or less the same way, with a few minor adjustments, without having us believe Cole would be viewed as a loony-tune.REGARDLESS lol, I swear, I actually did love this movie. It's just plain fun, getting to see all these wonderful characters up to their old devil-worshiping shenanigans again. And they really doubled down on the gore. Which any true fans of the genre (Evil Dead, Cabin in the Woods, et al...) can appreciate. Did NOT see the twist coming, admittedly. But once it arrived, I was like ""alright. I can co-sign on this."" It required a *LITTLE* bit of retconning, but it works. And I was happy with the ending.Yeah. Alright, I'm done. If you liked the first one, you'll probably have fun with this follow-up, too. If you DIDN'T like the first one? First of all, what's wrong with you? Second of all, you probably won't like this one either, in that case.Final thought: Max having his shirt off in the fast food flashback is brilliant lol.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
371,robcisneros,Keep making these!!,10,20 September 2020,These are fun and gory so please continue the story and more Bee in the future!,The Babysitter - Killer Queen
372,tristanevangelist-446-475631,Not as good as the first one,5,4 October 2020,"I really liked the first one, I was on track to like this movie that brought back a lot of the old cast. Robbie Amel was by far the best outta the old cast but they all still has the camaraderie that was so much fun in the first one. But damn this movie was really missing a strong relationship like Cole had with Bee. The biggest trouble with this movie is the twist in finding out that Melanie is the leader of the new blood cult and she's this cold blooded psycho killer, it made absolutely no sense and the throw away explanation was complete trash. I hope they make another movie cuz I think this franchise is still a lot of fun to watch.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
373,hypnoxpostmastergeneral,Your not supposed to think about it,10,11 September 2020,"Cheesy, dumb, gorey, fun comedy slasher. Fantastic sequel to an already good movie. It's not supposed to be thought provoking, it's entertainment. Just watch and enjoy.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
374,nec1211986,I wish i could unseen this sequence,4,22 March 2021,"Why did the write have to undo all great character development in the first movie? This is so unnecessary, guess what, you can keep Cole character as cool, badass as he was in the end of the first movie and the plot in this sequence still works. The cult could target the new girl and Cole could deal with them with his coolness and experience.And the fact that no one believes Cole is so laughable. How did they explain the 2 missing cops, the killed nerd?I give this a 4 because Bee's appearance in the last minutes.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
375,hoffmamh,Let's get a third movie!,10,12 September 2020,"I know it will get a lot of negative reviews but very few sequels capture the essence of the original. That being said, this is a fun movie. I laughed and smiled alot as well as jumped a few times. Just kick back, relax and enjoy a fun movie.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
376,jessst_07,A guilty pleasure .......but am I the only one creeped out by the underage sex?,5,22 September 2020,"I didn't mind the film, a really easy watch, with not much depth but not boring.
But why is a 14 year old encouraged to have sex and why is a scene heavily implying sex between two underaged teenagers included in the film.....Cole was 12 years old in the first film. This film is two years later...making him 14, 15 max. I am no way a prude but I just think it is a bit wierd that someone who is possibly 14 is pushed to have sex? Then congratulated by everyone when he does and is no way as seen as a problem.....",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

378,tzarnowski-96912,Shameless cash grab.,4,12 September 2020,What do films suffer from this year? Terrible rewrites. Terrible sequences. Terrible acting. Everything had to be wrapped up so soon and it shows. This kind of reminds me of the sequel to Mortal Kombat. I was so stoked and yet here we are. Looks like I'll be watching the original for a while and pretending this never existed.,The Babysitter - Killer Queen
379,joelcrb,Laughable but not really,4,24 September 2020,"Bad writing. Bad production. It isn't a horror movie, it's not a comedy. It's like a 4 year old rewrote A Scary Movie. Acting isn't terrible but pretty cheesy sometimes because the writing is so bad.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
380,wallie-66467,Loved it,8,10 September 2020,Really enjoyed the first film so was really Hoping that this one would not let Down and I have to say I loved it even if a little gutted about some of the cast dying,The Babysitter - Killer Queen
381,rayvenuk,Further down the rabbit hole,10,16 September 2020,"Absolutely loved the original film, and when I found out a sequel was landing on Netflix I was crossing off the days. Just finished watching it, and was not disappointed. Not as much gore as the first film, and the deaths were mostly predictable which made it much more fun. I could see what was going to happen and was ""Oh they wouldn't, oh they are, oh hell yes!"".
Definitely more camp than the first, and just as enjoyable. Definitely one I'll rewatch, just like the original.
Please PLEASE make the trilogy complete, please make the third film.
Then release a collector's box set, the gag reel and outtakes would be hilarious.
And please stop putting Robbie Amell on screen all the time shirtless, he's way too overdressed.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
382,martasarajic,MELANIE WILL NEVER BE BEE,2,26 March 2021,"Everything that was good in the first move is now being raped by unberable ""acting"" and overall cringe by the actress playing Melanie. Zero and I mean Z E R O layers to the character to the point that I am sure that this girl is just being herself, boring bland and cringe. I was eyerolling so bad I taught I would see the end of my skull by the end of the movie. Fortunately I love myself enough so I just switched to reallity tv. And for the rest of the cast..
Same. Just bland. This move shouldn't exist.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
383,mburkrph,Melanie???,10,10 September 2020,"A very good movie with lots of twists and turns, more so than the original. The biggest of course was finding out Melanie was part of the cult. Was she part of it in the first film or did something happen between the first and second films? This was a plot twist that seemed to just get thrown in.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen

389,zerodisarm,It's not terrible but it's also not good.,5,10 September 2020,"I was looking forward to this as the first movie was a pleasant surprise but by the time it finished I felt like it wasnt really worth my time. It's kind of a strange movie and a lot of scenes gave me Scott Pilgrim vibes but they just felt out of place and didn't fit into the world that was created with the first movie.
I wouldn't be surprised if people enjoy this movie but It has been 10 minutes since watching it and I cant think of a single thing I personally enjoyed about it.
The first movie I will gladly rewatch and have done so multple times already but this one I'm just going to forget ever happened.",The Babysitter - Killer Queen
