0,traceytak,Lazy acting,3,6 November 2021,"The acting is very lazy, no emotion, not much effort as if the director just said ad-lib what you want it doesn't really matter.. The storyline is pretty much 3 guys doing what 3 guys normally do in a run down part of town. Even the violence and sex are not anything different to what has been done before and it's easily watchable on autopilot without taking in what has been watched because it really didn't make any difference to the story. The music is just the same old sound that accompanies this same old drama that gets told again and again and inevitably just becomes the normal easily switched off and forget about it film. A good film needs to have impact to everyone. The low scores demonstrate this film has no impact which is a shame as in a good story that has the viewer engrossed in what will happen next, some of these actors could really shine.",Gully
1,LLgoatJ,A Mess,3,21 June 2021,"This film is about three young guys, all who had bad childhoods, going on a rampage. It started out well but quickly went down hill and ended up a bit of a mess.The story was hard to follow. The characters weren't particularly likeable, even with their child hardships revealed. It didn't really feel realistic. I also didn't really understand the Grand Theft Auto graphics and fantasy scenes. They seemed like an afterthought and didn't really fit in and seemed quite random. The film would have been much better without them. Although it is a good idea and done properly and throughout the film could have worked.Overall it was a good story and idea made into a complete mess. It just gets worse as it goes on. By the last 30mins I wasn't really paying attention. I wouldn't waste your time.",Gully
2,ivimikey,Not terrible but Not great,1,30 August 2021,"First of you got amber heard in this movie which is the very big mistake. That alone brings it down. Besides that the acting was bad also not great, story and idea was ok. This is something you wouldn't really care to watch and if you do you definitely won't again, you'll just forget about it.",Gully
3,Simonbakewell,Don't expect boyz n the hood,8,11 November 2021,I find it unbelievable how many bad ratings this film has! It covers mental health and abuse.some of the acting isn't the best but then some of the acting is really good.i think most of the bad rating were given by people expecting menace 2 society or something.i enjoyed it.,Gully
4,MoonwalkerKari,"Utter trash, worst acting I've ever seen.",1,19 June 2021,The movie is simply horrible. The acting is the worst. There's literally nothing else to say than that.,Gully
5,garyob-43280,Dont get the bad ratings?? GOOD MOVIE,10,8 November 2021,"Gave it a 10 to bump ratings up I would actually rate this a 7.5. This movie is worth a watch and I am really shocked at how low the ratings are.The three actors who played the main characters done a great job. The overall storyline was a bit unclear at times, but i was engrossed in the stories of each of the young teenagers and I was eager to find out what happened to them. Although they are an extremely voilent trio that you would not like to meet on a night out, their loyalty to each other makes them likable. They are 3 teens with serious pschological issues and poor childhoods who are just up to no good really. This movie is not a happy fairytale but instead an accurate representation of the harsh lives that some of the youth of LA have to lead. Gully also has some beautilly taken classic shots of LA ,fantastic place to see, tough place to live. Give it a go decent film.",Gully
6,netta-67734,Hard Story To Tell,7,14 November 2021,"I enjoyed the movie & the acting. It's unfortunate that some people don't watch the movies that they review on here. You can tell by them describing things that NEVER occurred in the movie. Is it based on who's on the poster?🤔 The story was a sad, hard one that needed to be told. Our Childhood trauma can lead us to destruction if we don't have it addressed properly. Also, MONITOR YOUR CHILDREN!",Gully
7,cokely,Brilliant 10 thumbs up!,10,13 November 2021,I'm not sure why this film has so many negative ratings. Possibly because some could never understand the circumstances. The cast are true artist and delivered an outstanding performance. I recommend 100%.,Gully
8,MarjorieHMorgan,Loyalty is the main currency,7,12 November 2021,"Gully (2019)A story of young friendships, but so much more.This is a tender portrayal of the interlinked complicated life of four young men. It surprised me, but that's only because I read some reviews beforehand. I hope you're not doing that. I hope you are reading this after you have watched the film, and you now know for yourself what a treasure this film is.You may disagree, and that's OK. It may not be for you, it was for me. It is for me.Gully is all about life's situations, and the options or choices available to these four friends, some of whom think their lives are summed up thus: ""D is for damned"".It is a magical film of hope that blurs the lines between truth and fantasy, but within each scenario is the every present eye in the sky of the police helicopter, or someone somewhere watching.I particularly enjoyed the fact that none of the main four characters have stereotypical life stories as is usually portrayed in tales from the streets of LA, however all of them are impacted by events in their past that influence their present, and is destined to direct the path to their futures.Throughout the story it's almost as if they are in a trance at pivotal moments in their lives, with their action overtaken by something they cannot, or do not want to, control. At times, it's like their lives are a game that they are playing, not ones they are living - a way to cope, maybe? They are always looking for a way out. They are all looking to fulfil the promises of a new born life, but constantly dealing with all the things in their lives that are broken obstacles in their paths.There are some violent scenes, but also portrayals of beautiful family relationships and neighbourhood friendships; these are particular touches of joy and humour.Terrence Howard, as Mr Christmas is the reluctant prophet of the film, appearing as and when needed to sprinkle words or either wisdom or warning; he sees and knows more than he wants to and shares from both vessels willingly.Kelvin Harrison Jr., Jacob Latimore, Charlie Plummer, and Jonathan Majors perform well as individuals and as a unit where the business of one is the business of them all; they are loyal.This is a dreamlike film, with a haunting soundtrack.I have watched it twice already.",Gully
9,laurabuchanan99,Jacob Latimore..... wow!,10,17 July 2021,Wow! This was amazing. The acting was brilliant.... Especially Jacob Latimore. I love him as an actor anyway but he was epic in this! Such a sad story and I can understand why the characters acted the way they did. Excellent writing and I found it thoroughly thought provoking. Ignore the bad reviews! Highly recommended. It's a 10 from me!,Gully
10,atoosaghorbani,Don't Watch,1,12 August 2021,"It's not worth it! Just a bland, exhausting movie.",Gully
11,bloodmuttwolf,Awful.,1,30 August 2021,A very boring movie. Never once captured my attention. Skip this movie if your considering it. Not worth your time.,Gully
12,joona-aleksi,Bad movie,1,23 June 2021,Very very very bad movie. Did not like on second of it. Absolute garbage.,Gully
13,andyjamesaj,Brilliant,10,25 June 2021,What a sensational movie and story.The people below haven't got a clue what they are talking about!!Acting and story 10 out of 10.,Gully
14,valex-05887,Feels like watching the news,2,19 July 2021,"It feels like watching some lame news, all story is weird. That amber looks like she had better days.",Gully
15,raygray-55192,Intense,10,18 August 2021,"This movie is intense, violent, and moving. It follows the friendship of three boys with different traumatic backgrounds as things spiral out of control. The acting is superb. The negative reviews on this site are puzzling. Awards and high reviews elsewhere.",Gully
16,yuihellscythe,just bad.,1,30 August 2021,Theres no point really watching. If i could rate 0 stars i would.,Gully
17,boobmcfarts,Garbage acting,1,31 August 2021,Good story but horribly casted. Bad acting ruins the idea.,Gully
18,bybran-93585,What a Waste,1,1 September 2021,By far one of the worst movies I've seen and awful acting skills. What a waste of money and time. Don't even bother!,Gully
19,michaelaajohnson,Boring,1,1 September 2021,"The dialogue was awful, the acting even worse. Terrence Howard is always a delight but the rest of the cast fell flat. Visually, the film is lacking as well which is a disappointment as that was one of the biggest pulls for me to see it.",Gully
20,catscommissions,Unwatchable - Horrendous - what was the point?,1,1 September 2021,"If I could rate this less than 1 star, I would give this movie a tiny speckle of one star, 0.01 if you will. The acting was abysmal, the story line, atrocious, and the casting? Was there ever a grip on that? If you're going to make a movie, make one with genuine actors rather than the pitiful excuse I have just seen.",Gully
21,arthurhawkergamer,Absolute trash!,1,2 September 2021,"Exactly what you'd expect from Amber Heards acting, horrific, she needs to go back to what she's good at manbeating.",Gully
22,eduardolopez-71246,I wish I could rate lower,1,2 September 2021,"Disgusting,horrible,bad,atrocious, would rate lower but can't.",Gully
23,msmith-81617,Worst movie ever,1,6 September 2021,"There needs to be a zero star rating, if there is a worse movie then this, the cia could use it in place of water boarding. How was this funded. Worst acting i've had to endure.",Gully
24,m-mirzapour96,Terrible!,1,12 June 2021,Terrible movie with a very bad scenario. Also with awful acting performances.,Gully
25,skyemccammon,Amazing cast,7,16 June 2021,Gully started out a little weird but it picked up half way! The cast was amazing and the acting was really moving! Also is Charlie Plummer ever bad in anything? The answer is no. Terrance Howard's performance was incredible but needed to be used more. Overall pretty good. I'd watch it again.,Gully
26,Misterdeex,Messy movie with insanely bad acting,1,19 July 2021,I have rarely seen movies that I dislike from start to end. This one is a prime example in that category and I hope I never have to see it again.,Gully
27,bfjeld,Why did I watch it all?,2,19 July 2021,"I want my two hours back? At first I thought it was just a little original, put no. Don't waste your time watching this! But there were some moments,so that's 2 stars instead of 1...",Gully
