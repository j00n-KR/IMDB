0,SnoopyStyle,two big time actresses,7,17 July 2018,"Ronit Krushka (Rachel Weisz) is a liberated woman living in New York City. She returns to her Orthodox Jewish community in London after her estranged rabbi father's death. There are conflicted feelings about the return of the rabbi's wayward only child. She's surprised to find her former best friends Dovid Kuperman (Alessandro Nivola) and Esti (Rachel McAdams) married to each other. Weisz and McAdams are two of the best actresses around and they deliver powerfully controlled performances. The first part is a bit slow. Mostly, that's due to the advertising that gave away its lesbian twist. The sex scene does have a quick awkward shot and I'm not enamored with the ending. This does have these actresses doing some big time lifting but the story doesn't have the highest of tension. Outside of the big three roles, this is a rather striped down movie.",Disobedience
1,kosmasp,"So little, so much",7,24 May 2019,"Being repressed and not being allowed to express your love is something you normally would not wish upon anybody. Or any normal/sane person should feel that way, no matter their relationship or feelings towards other individuals. Having said that, one may argue there is not much ""story"" in this one - but does it really need to have more? We're talking about a love story - a forbidden one at that.The well known female actresses go the extra mile emotionally even if not nudity wise. But even so, there is more passion and feelings here than in some other movies that do show skin. So if you don't mind love in all places and faces, this is a very good movie. Acting wise top notch and very well told, does not miss a beat",Disobedience
2,writers_reign,Tora! Torah! Torah!,5,3 December 2018,"Rachel Weiss - the only 'name' in the film - is anathema to me. Having agreed to appear in the travesty that was the remake of The Deep Blue Sea she weighed in with the worst reading of the lead character ever (and this is a female role comparable to Blanche in 'Streetcar' i.e. every actress has had a crack at it) so is more or less off my personal radar. However; I actually live - one of a handful of goys - in the area where the story is set and adjacent to where it was shot, with a shul on every corner and a mezuzah on every door. What I learned is that this is a matriarchal society who can only see a joke by appointment and are quite happy to live under self-imposed Draconian rules. It reminded me of nothing so much as a group of boys at a Public school who form a 'secret' society and take themselves unbelievably seriously (see: Les Disparus de St Agile). The film is very intense with four-fifths played in total silence and though it's difficult to fault the acting the overall feeling is why bother.",Disobedience
3,gradyharp,'May you lhave a long life',10,28 July 2018,"Naomi Alderman's impressive novel has been adapted for the screen by Sebastián Lelio and Rebecca Lenkiewicz and under Sebastián Lelio's direction and very sophisticated cast of actors bring to life a love story that is at once daring and powerful and deeply moving. Chilean writer and director Sebastián Lelio garnered many awards for his recent film A FANTASTIC WOMAN as well a GLORIA: he is rapidly becoming the leading name in fine challenging films. Ronit Krushka (Rachel Weisz) returns to England after hearing that her estranged father Rav Krushka (Anton Lesser) has died. He visits her old friend Dovid Kuperman (Alessandro Nivola) and discovers that he is now married to Ronit's long ago lesbian lover Esti Kuperman (Rachel McAdams); Ronit, Esti and Dovid has been childhood friends and when Ronit left her Jewish enclave to live in New York, the traditions and rules of the Jewish sector pushed Esti to marry - Dovid. Ronit is a fine arts photographer (her session photographing the tattooed Trevor Allen Davies is a treasured moment), Esti has become a shul teacher, and Dovid is now in line to take Rav's honored place in the synagogue. Under the eyes of Moshe Hartog (Allan Corduner), and his wife Frumka (Bernice Stegers), and the gossips Ronit gradually and subtly rekindle their old love in a richly and well-filmed passionate manner. The unification is challenged by gossips, rules, and Dovid's memories of Rav's final words that freedom is the most treasured aspect of life and the story ends with a sophisticated resolution.Rachel Weisz, Rachel McAdams and Alessandro Nivola are brilliant and the film is one of cinematic wonder. The intact Hebrew chants and singing add immeasurably to the story, as does the musical score by Matthew Herbert and the cinematography by Danny Cohen. Subtle, rich in emotion and understanding of both Jewish tradition and lesbian love, this is a film to treasure. Highly recommended",Disobedience
4,malcolmgsw,Dull and ponderous,5,7 December 2018,I went to see this film because it was set in the North London orthodox community. The problem is that the director spends so much time on the women snogging that he leaves a lot unexplained.It was only thanks to the synopsis that I had any idea what the plot was.I still can't understand my Moshe the shelter seller should have the father's will.In the end I was praying for it to end.It was at least 30 minutes too long.,Disobedience
5,lasttimeisaw,Reviews of Lelio's AN FANTASTIC WOMAN and DISOBEDIENCE,7,7 September 2018,"Released within the same calendar year, Chilean filmmaker Sebastián Lelio's fifth and sixth features boldly anchor their focal points onto people from marginalized spectrum and ethnic minority, and present two intimate character studies in which fortitude surmounts adversity. A FANTASTIC WOMAN is an Oscar's BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM title-holder, and its title refers to Marina Vidal (Vega), a transgender woman living in Santiago, Chile, whose much elder boyfriend Orlando (Reyes), promptly succumbs to a brain aneurysm on the night of her birthday, and what follows is the standard transphobia from Orlando's kin and common folks alike, besets her when she tries to adjust herself to the aftermath of this sudden bereavement. Lelio doesn't hold back from the ugly repercussions when Marina is divested of her protector, common-or-garden verbal abuse escalates into physical humiliation and violence, and she has to brave it all by her lonesome. Through Lelio's anti-rhetoric modus operandi - for example, a Marina-versus-the-wind snapshot makes great short work of encapsulating the morass she is in - trans-actress Daniela Vega brilliantly channels Marina's internalized baptism of fire with her dignity and integrity unscathed, it is a one-woman's show carried on her shoulders, Vega shows immense range from resilience to fragility, through her fierce gaze, tooth-clenched restraint and androgynous pulchritude that is so distracting unique and fetching (plus her mezzo-soprano virtuoso is a sumptuous boon), not for one moment, Marina cowers before the inane hostility which marginalized people meet on a daily basis, in fact, she has no pecuniary attachment to Orlando's next-of-kin, all she wants is to officially say goodbye to her loved one and one's grievance swells when such a fundamental human right cannot be met with a more benevolent fashion.Yet Lelio doesn't launch tirades to reprimand the blinkered mind-set (because that would be too cliché and tactless), even Marina's pent-up fit on top of an automobile doesn't necessarily offer viewers a cathartic exhilaration, because we twig, Marina's worst enemy is not them, they are inconsequential characters soon to be out of her life forever, the exigency is that she must condition herself to the unfair world of her own accord, ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"", like Lelio's bullseye-scoring metaphor pertaining to the content of Oscar's locker (after making a striking example of Vega's physical versatility in the strictly gender-binary sauna house), its vast emptiness is a wake-up call to anyone who pursues a lost cause or cannot let go something or someone, which or who simply doesn't exist anymore. DISOBEDIENCE takes place in a very different continent where klezmer and ordinances abound, but also tackles the consequences of a recent bereavement, hip New York photographer Ronit Krushka (Weisz) receives the bad tidings that her estranged father (Lesser) has passed away, which brings her back to the orthodox Jewish congregation in London after many years, where she reunites with her childhood friend Dovid Kuperman (Nivola), the chosen disciple of her father, a beloved Rabbi, who has tied the knot with Esti (McAdams), a revelation blindsides Ronit, because Esti is her former lover, and it is their sapphic affair that severed her tie with the congregation and prompted her exile years ago.Let bygones be bygones, what a naive thought, Ronit stands out like a sore thumb in the place where she grows up, it is discomfiting to see that even today, the Jewish doctrine about the weaker sex can be still so antediluvian, the same-old platitude, getting married, having children, blah blah blah! Believe me, even in a democracy-deficient developing country like China, folks have more sense of inclusivity than this London enclave. Rachel Weisz has a field day to play the free-spirited, recalcitrant black sheep, retorts back to the elders for the sake of one-upmanship, and one may give the wrong impression she is the one who is ready to make the fur fly here.No, it is not the case, what occasions Ronit's unexpected return (Dovid is surprised to find Ronit at his doorstep) is Esti, who languishes in the heterosexual marriage (symbolized by her unsightly wig) and pines for Ronit's return to rekindle her long-subdued desire, she makes the first move (catalyzed by The Cure's LOVESONG, golden idea!) and in the post-BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR era, girl-on-girl sex can no longer sit back only with heavy petting coddling male gaze, so bona-fide saliva transmitting and simulated orgasm strive for the status of new norm. More significantly, Esti is saddled with the exigent awakening to come to terms with her suppressed sexuality, from that point, Lelio's film quietly shifts its emphasis to her, and Rachel McAdams slowly takes an upper hand in the dueling game by her wonderfully timed introspection, subtly yet compassionately achieves a well-balanced symbiosis of powerlessness (waiting for Ronit's reciprocation and Dovid's grant of freedom) and determination (hellbent on raising a child under a different roof of persuasion). As a result, the story gives the final say to Dovid, a heterosexual man who has the power to free Esti or make her life miserable all at his proposal, which doesn't seem to be jibe with a with-it feminist vogue, but Lelio is bestowed with a godsend, whose name is Alessandro Nivola, disappearing into his personage's hardened carapace of orthodoxy, he bifurcates Dovid's affecting modesty and sincerity into two tributaries, one toward Ronit, kind but formal, a hesitation only lingers upon his amicability, betrays his reservation, and another toward Esti, the woman he loves and marries, it is solicitious and respectful, and after being dumbfounded by Esti's resolute coming out, he processes the whammy with extraordinary aplomb, heightened by Lelio's attention in minute gestures, and when he unleashes that ""free will"" speech in the climax, it is resoundingly touching sans any soupçon of condescension, therefore, the film salvages this love-triangle tangle with a concerted effort from both genders, and a less pandering coda that is nothing if not satisfactory, thus here is an apt exclamation to Mr. Lelio ""May you live a long life! (and bring us more inspiring tales)"".",Disobedience
6,Hellmant,A strong message about rebelling against conformity and following your heart (as well as fighting oppression).,7,25 May 2018,"'DISOBEDIENCE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An indie drama about a woman who goes back to the Orthodox Jewish Community she grew up in, after being outcast from it decades earlier due to her attraction to a female friend. The movie stars Rachel Weisz, Rachel McAdams and Alessandro Nivola. It was directed by Sebastián Lelio, and it was written by Lelio and Rebecca Lenkiewicz. The script is based on the book of the same name, by Naomi Alderman. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's now playing in indie theaters (like Portland and Corvallis, OR). I found it to be moving and somewhat involving, but just a little too slow-paced. Ronit Krushka (Weisz) learns of her father's passing, and then returns to the Orthodox Jewish Community she grew up in (for the funeral). She was outcast from the community, decades earlier, due to a childhood attraction to another girl, Esti Kuperman (McAdams). Ronit is shocked to learn that Esti is now married to David (Nivola), despite the fact that Esti only ever liked girls. A forbidden love affair between the two women once again comes to formation, and it once again shocks the community. The movie has a strong message about rebelling against conformity and following your heart (as well as fighting oppression). It's a touching love story in the end, filled with decent performances. The film is really depressing and slow-moving though. I admire how well made it is, and the important story it tells, but I definitely can't say I had a good time watching it at all. It's neither entertaining, nor uplifting. It is true to life though, and it's still an important film for people to see (I think).",Disobedience
7,ThomasDrufke,Passionate and Thought Provoking,7,7 June 2018,"Aside from being the first in line to see the next blockbuster or superhero film, I really enjoy going to see movies that show you a different side of life. Whether that be a post-apocalyptic wasteland, a medieval love story, or an inner city crime drama, movies have a way of shaping the world through different eyes and impacting your viewpoint on things for the better. Disobedience is a nice example of a film that displays a forbidden but passionate love story from a fascinating point of view, the religious angle. I no longer consider myself an overtly religious person, but if done right, the stories that derive from that of faith are certainly interesting to watch. And in Disobedience, religion is at the forefront without being overpowering. Rachel McAdams and Rachel Weisz play Esti and Ronit respectively, two lovers who find themselves back in the same town after the ladder was essentially exiled for being in love with Esti as a young woman. It's these performances, along with Alessandro Nivola as Dovid that bolster this deep drama with humanity and heart. What each of the trio goes through individually is incredibly powerful, especially when you come to realize the emotional stakes that become involved as the film near its end. I found Disobedience to be an extremely thought provoking and unique take on a romance.7.8/10",Disobedience
8,Red-125,Returning to an Orthodox Jewish community,9,7 June 2018,"Disobedience (2017) is an English film that was co-written and directed by Sebastián Lelio.Rachel Weisz portrays Ronit Krushka, who was raised in London's Orthodox Jewish community. She has left the community, and only returns when she receives news of her father's death. (Her father had disowned her, so no one told her that he was terminally ill.)I've seen a fair number of films about people who leave Orthodox Jewish communities. It's not a rare event, and it's not a rare movie topic. What makes this film different is that it has a lesbian love theme.The actors are very competent. However, when Rachel Weisz is in a scene, she's the person at whom you look. She's very beautiful, of course, but she's definitely a great actor.I'm not sure why this film has an anemic IMDb rating of 6.8. Maybe some were offended by the lesbian content. (Yes, even in 2018.) This is a case where I suggest seeing a movie, even though it's not rated as high as I think it should be.We saw this movie at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. It will work very well on the small screen.",Disobedience
9,howard.schumann,Challenging but fails to stir us emotionally,8,2 June 2018,"The desire to transcend the environment in which you were raised and choose your own direction in life is central to Disobedience, a clash between religious orthodoxy and the desire for sexual freedom. Adapted from Naomi Alderman's novel of the same name, it is the first English-language effort for Chilean director Sebastian Lelio whose critically acclaimed, ""A Fantastic Woman,"" won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language film in 2018. Co-written by Lelio and Rebecca Lenkiewicz (""Ida""), Disobedience stars Rachel Weisz (""My Cousin Rachel"") as Ronit, the daughter of Rav Kruschka (Anton Lesser, ""Allied""), an Orthodox Jewish rabbi who suddenly collapses and dies after delivering a sermon about mankind's unique ability to be the chooser.Her father's death prompts Ronit to return from New York where she is forced to confront the London community that she left many years ago after an altercation with her father over her sexuality and fears that she would be persuaded to get married against her will. The film opens in New York with Ronit taking photos of a man tattooed from head to foot, ice skating in a rink by herself with a glassy look in her eyes, and engaging in sex with a stranger in a public bathroom. When she returns to England for her father's funeral, she is greeted with obvious distance by the insular community who has not forgotten the circumstances that caused her to leave, though there are no overt expressions of intolerance.Nonetheless, Ronit is greeted warmly by her cousin Dovid Kuperman (Alessandro Nivola, ""You Were Never Really Here""), a student of her father, who invites her to stay in his house. Tension soon surfaces, however, when Ronit is introduced to Dovid's wife Esti (Rachel McAdams, ""Game Night""), her former lover, who married at the suggestion of Ronit's father but whose pretense to be something she is not is deeply problematic. We do not discover the connection between the two women at first, but it is easy to see that Ronit is not the only one who has brought baggage to the house. Attention is all on Ronit at a dinner party where she challenges assertions that a young woman should be married and have children.Unfortunately, only Dovid and her aunt Fruma (Bernice Stegers, ""Suite Française"") show any understanding. Esti is quiet and withdrawn, but emotions hidden beneath the surface seem ready to be unleashed. This in fact occurs when Esti accompanies Ronit to her father's house after Ronit learns that the house has been left to the synagogue rather than to her as part of her inheritance. Just happening to turn on an old radio which just happens to be there, the song they hear, ""Love Song"" by The Cure, contains such unsubtle lyrics as ""Whenever I'm alone with you / You make me feel like I am home again"" and ""However far away / I will always love you.""Predictably, the song triggers repressed feelings and they kiss and embrace for the first time in many years. When Dovid discovers their relationship, after openly expressing his anger, he is forced to address the conflict between his love for Esti and the orthodox teachings about homosexuality. Related to that is the question of free will and choice that the Rav raised in the talk before he died and one that Dovid forcefully addresses at a gathering. Ultimately every character in the film has hard choices to make, perhaps because they neglected to make them years ago and settled for what was convenient. Yet, in the recognition and ownership of the choice that must now be made, the characters true freedom of action is recognized and celebrated.Disobedience is a challenging film that reaches us on an intellectual level, but ultimately fails to stir us emotionally. While there are moments of excitement and spark, a lovely score by Matthew Herbert, and the spiritual power of Hebrew chants and songs hallowing the name of God, we never really get to know the characters who are more like symbols than actual human beings. Even considering its ultimate heartbreak, last year's ""Call Me by Your Name,"" a film that contained a similar relationship, seemed to balance its sense of loss with humor, vitality, and passion. Disobedience, on the other hand, is too full of ""significance,"" and is enveloped in a dirge-like shroud as if joy was forbidden by religious decree.",Disobedience
10,TheMovieDiorama,Disobedience unlocks a melancholic romance from its triangular imprisonment.,7,21 February 2020,"In Judaism, family life is regarded as a training ground for the Jewish way of life. Children are born into a religious community, where federations support schools, community centres and counselling services for the reverent strife each family leads. Its clerical boundaries indoctrinating the limitations of freedom. But what is freedom? No longer bound by the shackles of monotheistic traditions? Choosing to live the life one desires as opposed to being born into?For Ronit, the estranged daughter of an old Rav who suddenly succumbs to illness, free will overpowers institutionalised obligation. Her childhood best friend, Esti, is unhappily married to her other nostalgic pal, Dovid. The latter claiming the position of chosen disciple within the Orthodox Jewish congregation given by Rav's final testament. Suppressing her emotive lust for Ronit, Esti lives her life through fragmentation. Never wholly content. That is until Ronit flies back to London to discuss the disposition of her father's house. A tantalising flame rekindles between the two. A fire in which ""HaShem"" controls its burning embers of love. Thus commencing an illicit romance that raises the ethics of traditional practices against contemporary culture.Lelio, much like his work in 'A Fantastic Woman', highlights fundamental issues with archaic beliefs, and how emotions should not be controlled by sanctimonious scripts. The feature commences with a sermon of free will, a poignant theme tackled throughout. But with these actions come consequences. Ronit, having left the community years prior to her return, is faced with prejudice for her betrayal. Behaving in a manner not conforming to Orthodox culture. Esti, despite her yearning for freedom and adoration for Ronit, knows no different considering her marital vows to Dovid. Yet it is Ronit who provides the ornate key to Esti's eternal lock. Providing a tangible triangle that will test each other's beliefs, morals and ethics.Dramatic without peering into melodrama, Disobedience functions solely on the central three performances given by Weisz, McAdams and Nivola. Each representing a node of significant religious virtue, with Weisz' Ronit sinking to the bottom and Nivola's Dovid escalating to the heavens above. The intimacy provided by both Weisz and McAdams was palpable. From the muted scenes of explicit sexual nature to the reminiscence of a previous life. They both emanate affection for one another, just through a simple gaze into each other's soul. Weisz commanding each scene with a powerful aura of independence. McAdams, despite the wobbly British accent that occasionally sounded Swedish, providing the emotional conflict between religious duty and her own heart. The two supply a substantial amount of forbidden romance and engaging drama within the core themes explored.The weak corner to this three-sided conundrum lies on Nivola's involvement, or lack of involvement would be more fitting. His performance remained human, particularly when addressing the congregation. Yet, his character arguably is the most pivotal when discussing development. The emotional conflict between ""releasing"" his wife and maintaining both his religious and marital promises was unfortunately underdeveloped. Esti and Ronit are catalysts for Dovid's antithetical perspective. Disobedience is as much about his alteration as it is their steamy relationship. However Lelio chose to focus on the latter rather than the former, therefore crafting an incomplete triangle of unlocked potential. Various character actions, such as Esti fleeing her abode overnight to visit a pharmacy, resembled purposeful double entendres for the sake of creating drama and prolonging character interventions. These should've been integrated more subtly.Fortunately Cohen's subdued cinematography, bolstered by saturated cold shades, emphasises the imprisonment Esti is experiencing. Beautifully shot as always. Herbert's unique score also added some fluidity to the wavering romance, especially with the involvement of whimsical flutes.Regardless of the agitations outlined, Disobedience manages to highlight important issues when discussing free will. By representing an illicit same-sex relationship, Lelio is able to convey the survival instincts of female empowerment, through two richly powerful performances, without resorting to cliched romantic tropes.",Disobedience
11,paul-allaer,Powerful relationship drama starring Rachel Weisz at the top of her game,8,19 May 2018,"""Disobedience"" (2017 release from the UK; 114 min.) brings the story of Ronit. As the movie opens, we see a rabbi teaching at a London synagogue and collapsing, only to die. We then get to know Ronit, a Jewish photographer in New York, who gets the news that her father has died. She flies to London and when she arrives, she is met by her cousin Dovid, who is not exactly welcoming her with open arms. In fact, the entire family looks wearily at Ronit, who left for New York years ago. Ronit is surprised when she learns that Dovid has married Esti, Ronit's childhood friend. It's not long before we understand that there is something deeper between Ronit and Esti. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Sebastian Lelio, who just months ago won the Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar for ""A Fantastic Woman"" and before that directed the excellent ""Gloria"". Here he brings to the big screen the novel of the same name by British writer Naomi Alderman. He once again brings the story of a very strong woman, albeit in a completely different context. The movie is set in an Orthodox Jewish community in London, and with all of the strong social pressure and rules and expectations that this entails. Enter Rachel Weisz in the role of Ronit and as producer of the movie. Weisz is nothing short of sensational in this role. She is helped immensely by the two other lead performers, Rachel McAdams as Esti (is it just me, but I did have a hard time buying her British accent) and an almost unrecognizable Alessandro Nivola as Dovid. The last third of the movie more or less wiped me out emotionally, and that's all I will say about it. least but certainly not least, there is a fabulous orchestral score courtesy of British composer Matt Herbert (who also scored ""A Fantastic Woman""). Incidentally, director Sebastian Lelio's next movie is a Hollywood remake of his superb ""Gloria"" movie, this time starring Julianne Moore, and I'm cringing just a little bit (why mess with a near-perfect movie in the first place?).""Disobedience"" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to immediate acclaim. The movie finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, I am happy to report. If you are in the mood for a heavy duty character study/relationship drama that happens to be set within the Orthodox Jewish community in London, that which stars Rachel Weisz at the top of her game, you cannot go wrong with this. I readily suggest you check out ""Disobedience', be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Disobedience
12,smatysia,"Pretty good, as a psychosexual drama",6,9 March 2019,"I thought it was pretty good, as a psychosexual drama. It took a respectful tone to the Orthodox Jewish community, even as it completely rebelled against its strictures. Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams performed very well in the two leads, and most of the rest of the cast rang true, especially Alessandro Nivola.",Disobedience
13,I_Ailurophile,Fine film anchored with strong performances and thematic writing,9,4 September 2021,"It cannot be overstated how direly uncomfortable this is from start to finish. Interpersonal drama and conflict is central to the narrative, woven into every scene with the crucial clash of cultures and ideas that's written into every character. This so completely runs with that slant that every secondary character who in any way expresses disapproval becomes instantly, pointedly unlikable. From the premise alone I expected plenty of awkward drama, and 'Disobedience' delivers it in spades - along with marvelous performances and character moments. This is as excellent as it is cringe-worthy.Ponderous themes quickly and plainly present themselves, actualizing the immense strain between battling ideologies with all due gravity. Feminism versus patriarchy; love versus duty; individuality versus ""normalcy""; freedom and independence versus responsibility and stability. Stagnant, archaic social norms, contrasted against progressive, modern values; inflexibly rigid family and community structure, in opposition to robust, elastic, more freely flowing social bonds. As heavily as these concepts all weigh on the narrative, they are never deliberated upon inorganically, instead being threaded through every story beat. Much credit to director Sebastián Lelio and co-writer Rebecca Lenkiewicz, whose adapted screenplay gracefully balances plot progression with the great heft underlying it all. However unquestionably discomforting, no matter how profoundly somber, every passing moment feels wholly natural.Of course none of this would be possible without a strong cast to carry the burden, but everyone in front of the camera is very much up to the task. This goes most of all for the primary actors. I'm unfamiliar with Alessandro Nivola, but he portrays Dovid with a commanding steadiness and force of personality that's outright impressive. Rachel Weisz is far more recognizable, and she embodies protagonist Ronit with admirable poise and stubbornness, complemented with deep, tired hurt. Most fetching of all here, in my mind, is Rachel McAdams. We're broadly accustomed to seeing McAdams in parts that are more comedic, or sweetly romantic. But in inhabiting Esti, she above all shoulders a pronounced, exhaustive fusion of all the conflict and turmoil represented in the film. It's a role demanding absolute dramatic acting, range, and emotive capacity - and McAdams performs wonderfully. It's a real joy to see her here, and one can hardly go without remarking on the swell chemistry McAdams and Weisz share as scene partners.At its core 'Disobedience' is a revisiting of the classic notion of rebelliously swimming upstream against stalwart tradition. Yet this particular version is rendered with such purposeful, intense thematic material, and hearty performances, that the familiarity is almost an afterthought. There's something to be said for how all the most critical, chiding supporting characters are generally painted with a single wide brushstroke, but as these are all essentially background for the real meat of the film, the oversight seems minor. The result is a picture that, though not wholly perfect, delves into a reflection on LGBTQ relationships in light of staunchly opposed cultural dogma, and does so without relying on common tropes of the genre. Bearing in mind an obvious content warning for homophobia and all possible related topical matter, 'Disobedience' is an excellent feature I'd confidently recommend to just about anyone.",Disobedience
14,dierregi,Disrespectful for the departed - and those still alive,1,28 April 2020,"""Liberated"" gal Ronnie (Rachel n.1) flies back to London from New York, having been informed about the death of her estranged father, a rabbi in an orthodox Jew community. Before departure, she gets drunk and has casual sex with a man in a public toilet (charming).In London we discover that Ronnie is actually Ronit and not welcome by the community she abandoned, except by childhood friends Dovid and Esti (Rachel n.2), who got married after her departure.We slowly discover that Ronit and Esti had a relationship, but Esti decided to marry a man and stay in the community, despite her feelings still burning hot for Ronit.Ronnie is supposed to be grieving for her father, but all her energies are spent getting Esti to bed. We get the compulsory, titillating lesbian sex scene (and no, it was not necessary to the plot), even if the two ""Rachels"" have zero chemistry. Note that both women also have sex with men, which makes me think all these passionate lesbian love stories are just fulfilling a typical male fantasy turned into fashionable voyeuristic film-making.The ""Rachels"" tick all the misogynist's boxes: they're unreliable, self-involved, untrustworthy and governed only by instinct. Right in the middle of celebrating the passing of an honoured man, their cavorting is at the very least distasteful.Finally, the Esti character is particularly despicable, with her passive-aggressive attitude and her inability to make up her mind.Slow-moving, weak plot at best, dreadful lack of light, paste-faced actors and unsympathetic characters (except Dovid, who's actually too good for that couple of vipers).",Disobedience
15,truemythmedia,Decent. Not great.,7,23 May 2019,"This isn't a film I'd recommend to a ton of people. It's a well-made movie, but it's hard to go about suggesting a stark LBGTQ drama about religious repression. It's not a fun subject matter, and the film isn't as fantastic as it could be. I feel like this movie has a pretty niche audience: arthouse film fanatics and geriatrics. I saw this in a theatre where there were only other occupants were two (very chatty and seemingly bored) elderly folk, and I was honestly surprised they stayed through whole thing (particularly after the rather graphic sex scene in the middle). This isn't going to be a big movie- it'll be forgotten in a few years- but it's a movie that, if you are a fan of slow burn dramas, religious examinations, or character studies, you might like. It's not great, but it's pretty darn good, and Rachel Weisz and Alessandro Nivola both give some of the better performances I've seen thus far this year.",Disobedience

18,jadepietro,Love and the Question of Free Will,9,5 June 2018,"GRADE: B+ THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An emotional story that honestly depicts the pain that comes with love.JIM'S REVIEW: The summer movie season has arrived, filled with superhero blockbusters and sci-fi sagas as usual. But hidden in all the hoopla and hyperbole is a small independent film worth viewing. Director Sebastian Lelio's Disobedience is a gay love story between two friends who have gone their separate ways only to meet again later to consummate their relationship once again.The scorned daughter of a strict rabbi, Ronit (Rachel Weisz) now leads a successful bohemian lifestyle as a professional photographer in New York City. Unfortunately she is abruptly forced to return to her strict Orthodox Jewish community in London. The memories of her earlier rebellious life hold a painful reminder to her past, after being shunned many years before by her father and friends. It is here she encounters her childhood friends, Esti (Rachel McAdams) and Dovid (Alessandro Nivola), Ronit's father's adoptive protégé. and the principal surrogate to her father's love. Coming back brings with it a cultural shock to Ronit as she deals with this conservative close-knit clan of judgmental onlookers. The discomfort is palpable. Added to that distress is the fact that Ronit had no idea that her once close friends have now married. A sense of awkwardness and tension prevails as both Dovid and Esti extend their home to their foreign guest during her visit.Disobedience subtly tells its story of two women caught in a patriarchal society who depend on each other's strengths and weaknesses. This sensitive literate screenplay written by Rebecca Lenkiewicz and the director asks its viewers to decide if love should trump faith and if there should be any consequences for our human flaws. It is a film that dares to deal with large issues of religion, conformity, and free will in telling its tender love story.Filmed in muted tones by Danny Cohen, the film slowly establishes the relationship between the three major characters and allows the actors to fill in any gaps. And the three leads give fully realized performances. Ms. Weisz provides the impetus for the emotional conflict and gives her character a vulnerability and isolation that defines Ronit completely. Ms. McAdam has the more difficult role as her character is an enigmatic figure as written, confused by her attraction and unfulfilled as Dovid's loyal wife. But the actress accomplishes a great deal with her initial hesitation, lonely introspective conversations, and indirect downward glances which makes Esti all the more tragic. Yet, the most convincing portrayal comes from Mr. Nivola who presents a man trying to come to terms with his deep-set religious beliefs and his quest for human compassion and tolerance. All three are superb and add to the storyline, even when the plot becomes slightly contrived.Mr. Lelio has crafted his film with an true understanding of his subject and he treats his characters and their situations with an honesty and thoughtfulness, including the passionate tryst between the two lead actresses which is never gratitious and completely necessary for the plot to be convincing. However, the director does allow the suds and melodrama to build a tad too excessively and cannot seem to conclude his film without the customary histrionics. (The film seems to have three too many endings, two of which are awash in sentimentality. I preferred that group embrace moment myself.)Highly dramatic and, at times, erotic and sensual, Disobedience is a showcase for three fine actors and is an underrated film that should be seen by anyone who has loved and lost.

19,pc95,Somewhat Flat,5,11 August 2018,"""Disobedience"" directed by Sebastian Lelio does ok for its beginning, but becomes muted and flat through its full runtime. For one, Jewish orthodoxy as a setting backdrop is fairly uninteresting. My wife got up and gave up after about 15 min in. There are some interesting moments especially when the 3 leads are together amid a bit of tension. Writers Lelio and company choose to go towards plausibility and rationalism instead of pomp and emotions, and it takes away from the effect. There are 2 main plot threads that are explored but neither really impart catharsis. Weiz as often in films before leads the performance. Was hoping for more substance and panache. 5.5/10 - mixed",Disobedience
20,wisewebwoman,Most of the stars are for tackling a tricky subject,5,25 November 2018,"But failing.I am struck mainly by how little substance there was in the main characters, lots of staring meant to be meaningful no doubt.Briefly, it is about a lesbian love story in an orthodox Jewish community. One of the lovers vanishes to New York from London (?) and returns for her father's, the rabbi's, funeral.The movie is rampant with cliches and tropes. I expected far better. One scene of a lover in a nightie chasing a taxi down the street made me groan out loud.The sex scenes are oddly static and involve full clothing in private hotel rooms. I am not prurient but this felt highly contrived, sparing modesty of the actors no doubt but there are ways of filming nude without the full monty, surely?The biggest trope of course was the old one of two female lovers always been torn apart at the end. I was thankful it wasn't a Thelma and Louise redux.In this case, all that angst and rebellion went the way of the whimper.A pity.",Disobedience
21,proud_luddite,Flawed but still good,7,11 July 2018,"Ronit (Rachel Weisz) is a New York photographer traveling to London due to an unexpected death. During her visit, she is confronted with a cold response from her Orthodox Jewish community from whom she had been ostracized in the past. Other feelings are revived as she re-encounters a woman (Rachel McAdams) with whom she had shared sexual relations when both were teenagers.The tension in the opening sequence is real and palpable as Ronit is treated with restrained politeness or outright ignored. At a dinner scene when she is questioned about any possible marital plans, Ronit represents any single person of any background or sexual orientation who has experienced such glimpses of hell.Some flaws are evident. The drama is powerful though sometimes overwhelming. Nearing the end, the movie seems too long and still leaves some issues unclear especially the inner conflict of the McAdams character who is married to a man. Such flaws might justify a lower rating but the film's pluses outweigh its minuses.The contrast between the life choices of the two main characters is rich and leaves much room for thought. Should one abandon one's family and community to be truer to one self while living with a major loss? Or should one stay in and enjoy the community of one's youth at the greater expense of having to hide one's deeper self? The two leads give solid performances each playing someone in the same terrible dilemma while having chosen different paths.",Disobedience
22,blott2319-1,Too bad the poster spoils it all,6,28 October 2021,"I wonder if I would be more intrigued by Disobedience if every single poster, image, and trailer I'd seen for the movie didn't spoil the fact that it was focused on a lesbian relationship between two of the main characters. The early scenes have a strange tension and you can clearly tell there is something deeper going on, so it feels like that surprise would be more poignant if you didn't know where the movie was headed. Instead, I found the movie a bit plodding and slow. I was still interested in some of the interweaving problems that surround the protagonists which affected much more than just the romantic relationships, but I can't say the movie was all that surprising or thrilling. What made it stand out were the powerful performances from the cast, particularly Rachel McAdams and Alessandro Nivola. I felt every emotion these two were experiencing, even when they couldn't articulate them. I think Disobedience could have been a more poignant or unique film, but it is well-made and I can see why some people might love it.",Disobedience
23,rockman182,Disobedience (2018),6,30 April 2018,"Yes, there was another film that came out during Avengers: Infinity War release week. I was immediately excited for Disobedience as soon as I heard about it. I mean how could you not be? Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams (who I am infatuated with) in a film about a forbidden romance? I was so in. I did see Sebastián Lelio's A Fantastic Woman earlier this year, so I was really pleasantly surprised to hear he had another project out so soon. I can draw parallels between the two films and while Disobedience is not perfect and has lapses its well acted and has an interesting look at a religious community being scarred by a ""scandalous"" affair.The film is about a woman who returns to a very strict Orthodox Jewish community when her father dies. While there she sees her former lover who is now married. The problem is the fact that people in the Jewish community do not know about the relationship that has occured and also because a lesbian affair is frowned upon in the community. Both women also must deal with harboring the feelings that they have for each other, while attempting to maintain their standing in the Jewish community.The first thing that's instantly noticeable about the film is its depth into an Orthodox Jewish world. The films backdrop is its strict nature and how a lesbian romance must be hidden from the community. Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams are great in this as expected, and have great chemistry. Their intimate scenes (which are very very intimate) are believable and are a strong point in selling the romance. I always knew McAdams was a talent since she had a good showing on season 2 of True Detective.The film reminded me of A Fantastic Woman in a way because in that film there is a struggle to accept a transgender person, although the implications in that film are more hostile. I also couldn't help but compare this film to Carol (which is one of the very best films of the decade). Its nowhere near the levels of Carol but does a decent job for what the film is. There are lapses where the film seems slow and it suffers from its best moments being purely when Weisz and McAdams share the screen. Its still a worthy watch, just don't expect anything spectacular.6/10",Disobedience
24,juliankennedy23,Drama is life with the dull bits cut out.,3,31 August 2018,"""Drama is life with the dull bits cut out."" is a famous Alfred Hitchcock quote at least according to my Civilization V pause screen. Director Sebastián Lelio has clearly not gotten that memo. This movie makes Woody Allen's Interiors look as if it was directed by Michael Bay.The Good: the acting is on point with the material given. Unlike others, I thought Rachel McAdams accent was fairly good. The Orthodox Jewish setting seems well researched and the overall theme of man being between the beasts and the angels is well represented with a good opening and callbackThe Bad: Do you want to see endless shots of people setting tables or carrying luggage upstairs this film has you covered. Every scene also seems to take a minute longer than it really needed to. The film simply does itself no favors. The palate is shockingly grey. The scenes have no life and outside of a small classroom scene, the film is bereft of children and noise. (Compare to say the way The Godfather always had such activities just in camera range. Considering big families are very common in such communities this seems particularly strange.) Nobody says what he or she are thinking, which may be the point, but you are left with two hours of truncated conversations and meaningful glances.The Ugly: I am not too proud to admit I have sat through some pretty bad films for a hot lesbian scene or even nudity, (Blame it on Rio, Embrace of the Vampire cough cough). Surely a scene of hot lesbian sex between Rachel McAdams and Rachel Weisz will make watching people not talk to each other for an hour worthwhile. Oh God... director Sebastián Lelio had just one job and he dropped the ball and then some. In other words, don't throw away that Misty Mundae Bluray boxed set just yet. Do remember that scene from Drag Me to Hell between the gypsy woman and Alison Lohman? Or maybe that scene between Ripley and the queen mother in Aliens?Leaving aside the obvious lack of passion in the scene and the surprising amount of clothing still on the characters there is a fetish, which I will not spoil, that the director felt this was the perfect time to introduce to the wider world. A fetish one might expect in a horror film or maybe an early John Waters piece. Eww... is not a word you want to hear from your audience when showing them, the well climatic, scene of your film. Look I wasn't expecting Blue is the Warmest Color with major Hollywood stars, but would it have killed you to throw in a Roger Coman's Forbidden World style shower scene before going back to ten minutes of packing for the airport, ten minutes in line at the airport and then the coming back from the airport without taking the flight after all scene?In Conclusion: Boring with bad sex is common enough in real life one does not really need a film to replicate such things.",Disobedience
25,juanmuscle,Very Interesting...,10,30 July 2018,"I really enjoyed this tale. I learnt a lot about a different religion, it was nice and thoughtful, they are a tight nit group who really care about each other. Although no matter how hard we try to lead a perfect life, no matter how much attention we put to every single detail, no matter how we calculate and keep a vigil on the precarious unforeseen, all our contingency plans are but a makeshift band-aid in the face the calamatous unruly heart. This was extremely well-written, there is no doubt about that, the way it unfolded is exactly how a natural thread in the living world might unfold, there was nothing forced or strained nor did the plot yank or pull us one way or anything forced! It all felt so comfortable and yet against the backdrop of the orthodox movement we also felt for everyone involved. So many different perspectives gave life to the plot added to the theme and bolstered the undercurrents, but it also left so much room for the element of mystery, once our hearts began to sink, boom! Hope loomed over the terrible pall, once our hearts felt fettered, boom! Freedom loomed over to sweep us away in a flurry of possibilities. Excellent script! 'May you live a long life' this powerful thoughtful well-intention phrase was being thrown about throughout the tale as if one might say Hallo anywhere else to perhaps our neighbors, but when the two ladies said to each other at the end, charged with so much backstory, it really moved us to look at the phrase word for word and really experience its genuine true meaning of hope rich and full teeming with glory as if said from the soul, 'May you have a long life full of truth and love and joy and hope and vision and everything that is going to make it a life worth living, and perhaps I can be in it?'

31,Alexander_Blanchett,The story of two Rachels.,7,24 November 2018,"The film offers a great story about suppression and discrimination that is more than relevant and important these days. It is directed by one of the most interesting international directors, Sebastian Leilo.
The two leading roles are perfectly filled with two actresses who not only share the same first name but also a fantastic charisma and have a wonderful chemistry. Both Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams give fantastic performances that really stick with you and especially McAdams goes beyond the kind of characters and roles she usually does and it was great to see her in a character that developes very well throughout the film. Weisz is also fantastic, and I love how brave and picky she is with roles these days. Alessandro Nivola surprised me with a truly good supporting turn, and especially at the end really shines.
All of it is there, but then the film starts to suffer from a weak screenplay after the second half that only is worth to see for Nivola's monologue at the end. But the story somehow goes nowhere, or at least nowhere interesting and just drifts aways somehow.

This is a common problem in Orthodox communities when people choose a different belief system than the one they were raised with. It presents a myriad of challenges to navigate and this film portrays it with the utmost delicacy.The film has a brilliant pseudo-horror vibe with the voyeuristic looks that her disapproving peers inflict upon her with as she sits with them at dinner or walks through the streets alongside them. The film is advertised as a film about a lesbian relationship, but it's really a film about free will because being in a pre-marital sexual relationship, dating a secular jew, even having secular Jews in your friend circle or getting an education all lead to the same end result of shunning anyways.

40,danybur,A trip to the past and the future,8,8 August 2021,"SummarySensitive chronicle of a complex reunion of a photographer with a young love, as part of her return to a London Jewish Orthodox community where both had grown up. An approach with characters full of nuances, far from the Manichaeism of the Unorthodox series and with great performances, especially that of Rachel McAdams.ReviewRonit (Rachel Weisz), a photographer based in New York, must return to London when she learns of the death of her father, a rabbi of an Orthodox community in that city, where she grew up. The trip will involve the reunion with Esti (Rachel McAdams) and her husband Dovid (Alessandro Nivola) and with feelings that she had had to leave behind.The movie posters unequivocally announce that Ronit's past love is Esti. In any case, the way in which Sebastián Lelio's film reveals this link is exemplary, posed with a certain tension, as if for a viewer who does not know it. And yet, it retains a certain element of surprise when it ends up manifesting.And the surprise is given by the dynamics of the bond that is reborn between the two. Ronit had to leave the community while Esti adapted to it by marrying their friend. It is also a key moment in the life of Dovid, a favorite disciple of the late Rabbi (Ronit's father) and his sure successor.With English phlegm, the family and community environment will make Ronit feel how she feels about her past decisions and her present, while she goes through a duel with contradictions and a loving reunion at the same time. But it is Esti who may begin to walk a path more in line with her feelings and her desire, a journey that can take her from resignation to freedom.Lelio admirably unwinds the ball of this love triangle, of this drama of three characters at a crossroads. The scenes of sexual intimacy between them achieve the perfect balance between modesty and a daring and intense sensuality at times epiphanic. On the other hand, although it is an Orthodox community, the intimacy of the marriage allows us to see that we are not facing the extremes raised in the Unorthodox miniseries. It is precisely the character of Dovid who also contributes a complexity that distances the story and the film from the Manichaeism of good and bad posed by that series.The performance of the leading trio is exemplary, but it is Rachel McAdams who takes the laurels marking each of the stages of the evolution of her introverted character, in the same way that Lelio is modifying the tone of his story to the rhythm of the emotions of his characters.",Disobedience

42,Bertaut,A well-told love-story set against a background of religious orthodoxy,7,18 December 2018,"Depicting the problems that can arise when deeply held spiritual beliefs clash with notions of personal freedom, Disobedience is the story of a forbidden love given a second chance. Based on Naomi Alderman's 2006 novel, written for the screen by Sebastián Lelio and Rebecca Lenkiewicz, and directed by Lelio, the film covers some of the same thematic territory as Lelio's previous features; Gloria (2013) deals with a 58-year-old divorcée trying to re-enter the dating scene by frequenting singles-bars, and Una mujer fantástica (2017) looks at a transgender waitress trying to come to terms with the death of her boyfriend, whilst also navigating a prejudiced society. In Disobedience, Lelio turns his attention towards a lesbian relationship within London's relatively insular Modern Orthodox Jewish community. What all three films have in common is the centrality of a complex and strong woman facing up to (almost exclusively patriarchal) societal hostility. Kind of like a cross between Carol (2015) and Apostasy (2017), Disobedience eschews melodrama, and is uninterested in presenting a binary story where faith is the Big Bad. Although it is certainly critical of the strictures that can result from a rigid application of Halacha (Jewish religious laws), the community itself is depicted respectfully, with the most representative Jewish character arguably the most sympathetic figure in the film. Although things can be far too on the nose from time to time, Lelio's non-intrusive direction more than compensates for that, and overall, this is a fine film, both thought-provoking and moving.The film opens with Rav Kruschka (Anton Lesser) abruptly dying in the midst of a service. In New York, his estranged daughter Ronit (Rachel Weisz) gets a call informing her of his death, and she returns home, heading to the house of Dovid (a superb Alessandro Nivola), her childhood friend, and Kruska's protégé. Although the community isn't especially happy to see her back, Dovid offers her a spare room. She accepts and is stunned to learn he is married to Esti (Rachel McAdams), another childhood friend. Over the next few days as the community prepare for Krushka's levaya (funeral), it becomes clear that Ronit and Esti were once more than friends, and the more time they spend in one another's company, the more their suppressed feelings come to the surface.Thematically, Disobedience is far more concerned with the clash of views that results from Ronit's return than it is with condemning the beliefs of the community per se. When she first arrives at Dovid's house, she instinctively reaches out to hug him, forgetting about negiah (the forbidding of physical contact between men and women not related by blood, or married), and he immediately, although not unkindly, recoils. Later, there is an exceptionally awkward (but very funny) Shabbat meal, where Ronit seems to take great delight in being as outrageous as possible, riling up the assembled guests with her progressive worldview. This kind of ideological conflict, however, is also found within the characters themselves. Esti, for example, is torn between her desire for Ronit on the one hand, and her commitment to Dovid on the other. For her part, Ronit too internalises discord; although she has been estranged from him for many years, she is genuinely hurt to learn just how completely Krushka had divorced himself of her memory, seen most clearly when his obituary refers to him as ""sadly childless"".Tellingly, during the Shabbat dinner, Dovid tries to play peacekeeper, whilst a couple of cutaways to Esti show her smiling to herself as Ronit burrows under the skin of those present. This kind of delicate touch on Lelio's part can be seen throughout the film, with numerous wordless gestures allowing the actors to convey backstory in lieu of exposition. For example, after Ronit arrives, although Dovid recoils when she tries to hug him, and although when she tries to light up a cigarette in his kitchen, he asks her to smoke in the garden, he accompanies her outside, shielding the flame from the wind in a gesture both kind and intimate.On paper, the story might lend itself to a condemnation of the kind of social suffocation and emotional repression that can result from fundamentalism. Instead, however, the film spends time building a respectful, if not idealised, picture of the community's beliefs and practices. A key part of this respect is Dovid himself, an inherently decent and honourable man. In a less nuanced film, Dovid would be a fire-and-brimstone obstacle to Ronit and Esti's happiness, a Roger Chillingworth-type. Instead he is presented as someone who, like Esti, faces a difficult choice - that between his communal position and his faith on the one hand, and his genuine love of Esti and affection for Ronit on the other; his lifelong devotion to the Tanakh conflicting with modern day sensibilities. Indeed, perhaps Dovid's most salient characteristic is internal conflict. This is manifested aesthetically in a scene where he is addressing the synagogue. Lelio films the scene in such a tight close-up, that every time Nivola moves even slightly off his mark, he goes out of focus. It's a brilliant example of content generating form, and is typical of Lelio's directorial lightness of touch.However, for all that, the film never lets you forget that this is a community of negiah, where married women must wear a sheitel wig in public, and where the genders are strictly divided at religious services. As Ronit and Esti discuss their sexuality, Esti points out that she and Dovid have sex every Friday night, ""as is expected"", and that the reason she was married to Dovid in the first place was that Krushka hoped ""marriage would cure"" her, a concept not far from homosexual conversion therapy. In this sense, although respectful of the community, the film does challenge some of the tenets of their belief system, particularly its myopic sexism.Obviously, a major theme is sexuality. Much has been made of the sex scene between Ronit and Esti, with some critics accusing it of being little more than titillation at best, a graphic example of the male gaze at worst. However, this is to completely miss the point of the scene in relation to the whole. There are actually two sex scenes in the film; one between Ronit and Esti, and the other between Esti and Dovid. And although they couldn't be more different, they also couldn't exist without one another, as the abandonment, lust, and sense of pressure being released when Esti is with Ronit contrasts sharply with the detached, formulaic, and passionless scene with Dovid; the two scenes explicitly comment on one another. The scene between Ronit and Esti is the physical manifestation of the characters' long-repressed desire. It's a wholly justified narrative moment, and a necessary beat for the two characters. It's not an aside or a piece of voyeuristic male fantasy, it's the centre of the whole film. Together, the two scenes represent Esti's binary choice - an unbridled and sexually fulfilling, but unstable relationship with Ronit, or a dutiful and dull, but respectful and secure relationship with Dovid.If I had one major criticism, it would be that although Lelio's direction is extremely subtle, some of his and Lenkiewicz's writing choices are spectacularly on the nose. The opening sermon is a good example - a religious diatribe whose subject is mankind's freedom to choose, the concomitant ability to disobey, and the notion that freedom is impossible without sacrifice, in a film about these very same issues. Another example is that Dovid and his yeshiva students are discussing the one book of the Tanakh dealing with sexuality rather than spirituality, the Song of Songs, whilst Esti's secondary school students are studying adultery in Othello. The worst example of this, however, is found when Ronit and Esti go to Krushka's house and Ronit turns on the radio, which just so happens to be playing The Cure's ""Lovesong"", a song which perfectly encapsulates their situation (""Whenever I'm alone with you/You make me feel like I am home again""). Not exactly subtle.These issues aside though, this is an excellently crafted film. Once again examining female desire, issues of patriarchal oppression, and profound self-doubt, Lelio delivers a mature and considered meditation on the conflict between faith and sexuality. Eschewing black and white criticism of secular isolationism, Lelio respects the milieu too much to cast it as the villain. Instead, there is an elegance to the way in which he depicts it. Equal parts sensual and spiritual, the lethargic pace and absence of any narrative fireworks will probably alienate some, especially those expecting a pseudo-porn movie, but for the rest of us, this is thoughtful and provocative cinema in the best sense of the term.",Disobedience

45,bastille-852-731547,"Riveting, Thoughtful, Complex Drama",8,29 April 2018,"This new film from Sebastian Lelio tells the moving story of a woman who goes home to her Orthodox Jewish community in London for her father's (a rabbi) funeral. While there, she falls in love with a woman she knew from the past. Lelio builds a stirring portrait of an Orthodox Jewish family that feels both close-knit and intricate at the same time. The culture of such a community is depicted in thoughtful detail without ever overshadowing the story's primary motifs and motivations. The film's script is uniquely written and mixes intense family drama with moments of dry humor or dramatic elements of a somewhat lighter tone. For those concerned that such shifts in the writing could make the film fear uneven, fear not: the narrative always feels satisfying from beginning to end. The film is able to use writing to generate genuine emotional power, although it takes time to build up to such a crescendo in the movie's quietly moving finale.As far as the acting is concerned, fans of Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams will not be disappointed here. Both actresses are outstanding in their respective roles, although I will say Weisz is slightly better. She is able to show a genuine range of acting technique in her role, and remains captivating for viewers to watch from beginning to end. My only real criticism of this film is that the pacing can be rather spotty at times, and can sometimes be slower than it needs to be given audiences' abilities to absorb plot details. While the film never feels boring or annoying at all (unless, of course, one only wants to watch explosions and CGI when you go to the movies,) audiences sometimes feel a bit ready to move on with the narrative before a specific moment in the film may progress. Otherwise, this is a great and thoughtful drama that addresses thought-provoking issues in the world today (religion, sexuality, and family) while boldly challenging audiences to consider their own responses to such issues themselves. Gladly recommended. 8/10",Disobedience
46,Nightmarelogic,Not a bad movie just not nothing new,6,17 March 2019,This movie was;t exactly bad and it was well acted by everyone involved but it also had the one lesbian trope I hate most. One of them is already married to someone else. This sort of got around it by making the two characters young lovers who had gotten caught by one their Hassidic Jewish (I am not Jewish so I will say nothing about how realistic the portrayal of Jews are in this) father. The movie takes player years later when the father dies and the daughter returns home for the funeral only to find her young love married but of course since this is a lesbian film in does delve into the idea of can a heterosexual marriage ever really cure or fix gay people? The answer is of course no and them movie does acknoldge that. It also acknoldges that a the married woman who finds herself pregnant just can't run away with her lover even though that is what she wants to do. So to its credit it tries to be adult about tis problems and at the same time tell a story about free will and free love. O am just not sure it succeeds but I am also not sure it fails.,Disobedience

I loved the acting in it, Rachel McAdams and Rachel Weisz are great in it. What surprised me the most was the complexity of the male character played by Alessandro Nivola, who is a stand out in my opinion. He is incredibly written and the ending of the film where some decisions need to be made gets very touching. The movie is a bit slow in some parts but really that's my only real complaint.
Overall I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a love story done right, well done to everyone involved with the movie as they did a wonderful job.",Disobedience
49,meritcoba,Infuriating movie,3,3 February 2021,"I have given this movie a three out of ten not because it is a bad movie, in fact it isn't. The acting is great. The story, although sad, is decent enough and the setting, although dominated by drab grey is okay, if not a little dull. You can say that while it isn't a master piece, it is an okay movie.So why the low score?
This is because the movie infuriated me.Let me explain(spoilers ahead).Contrary to what you might think the central character in this story is not Rachel Weisz although the story is told from her perspective. In fact it is Rachel McAdams. She is married to Alessandro Nivola and they are part of a orthodox Jewish community. In fact he is a Rabbi. The three of them used to be friends until Weisz left one day for New York. The movie kicks off when Weisz decides to return after hearing that her father has died.The center theme in this movie is duty versus freedom and this is expressed quite bluntly at some point when McAdams asks her husband to set her free and tells him that she is pregnant and does not want her child to grow up in a world that left her no choice. Another blunt moment is when Nivola makes a speech about duty near the end of the movie.The movie is quite blunt in other things too. For instance, Weisz finds out that almost nobody wanted her to come back and this is pointed out by a newspaper article that says that her father died childless and when she hears her father left her nothing in his will. Her existence is not merely denied: she doesn't exist.
There is more. When she enters her father's house together with McAdams the song Lovesong by The Cure is played and specifically these lines: Whenever I'm alone with you make me feel like I am home again.
But even more! Prior to Weisz leaving New York we get an unloving short sex scene between her and a man that is contrasted against the drawn out sex scene between Weisz and McAdams later in the movie. In fact any sex that is mentioned with a man is made out to be obligatory and loveless.During the movie we get a few things revealed.
The two women had a love relation, something that is and was unacceptable in the community.
Nivola and McAdams married because he wanted to help her get over 'it' and she was told that she was not right in her head(this is literal from the movie).
We also get told that McAdams was the one who informed Weisz about the death of her father and that she did it deliberately to get Weisz to come back.
The two girls always were attracted to women, but they never did anything with it, not even Weisz who had broken with the shackles of her past. In fact we are told that she never met anyone and apparently engaged in quickies with men.Essentially the movie is because McAdams informed Weisz about her fathers death. This made the latter come over from the US and this is what McAdams wanted. You would then expect that this would result in something but this is not what happens. In fact McAdams is almost unseen in the first part of the movie and the two girls hardly respond to each other. And then suddenly about a third in they hit it off which cumulates into a long sex scene about halfway in. Then the movie see-saws as McAdams cannot make up her mind and Weisz not doing much more than trying to flee. Eventually this leads to the moment where McAdams asks her freedom from Nivola. Which then is totally undone when Nivola makes a speech in the Synagogue that comes down to: duty is important.Weisz doesn't have any kind of character arc. She is the same as when the movie started and her trick is to flee. But fleeing has gained her nothing. She is a lonely figure who has quick sex with men whom she doesn't love and she has no family and probably dies a lonely death. She has become nothing.McAdams has a character arc of sorts but it is only to make her end up where she started. McAdams might not have found love but she had found her role in life: that of being the mother of her child and the wife of her husband. She has become something.What infuriates me is that the whole movie is aimed at rubbing this is by leaving no alternatives. The whole 'lesbian' affaire is there to contrast the two women and the whole story railroads them to an outcome.But what takes the cake is near the end. Weisz drives of in a taxi, but McAdams runs after her. They kiss passionately and then nothing happens. Yeah, they wanted to make sure you go the message.",Disobedience

52,ccamp89,A glorified Hallmark movie,3,29 May 2018,"There's no doubt that Disobedience attempts to tell an important story about growing up gay in a fundamentalist religious community and the lasting impact such an experience could have on someone. But as much as I'd like to sing its praises for tackling the subject matter, the execution sadly just isn't there.This is an incredibly self-serious film, which isn't a problem in of itself should it have contained the level of substance and drama to match that tone. Instead, Disobedience repeatedly offers up melodrama and clichés more befitting of a Lifetime movie, right down to a scene where one of the leads frantically chases after the other as she departs in a taxi. There's nothing inherently wrong with melodrama, but the problem is that the film has no self-awareness. These stiff, wooden, cheesy moments are presented as if this were an Oscar-worthy feature without any of the necessary depth or nuance in the screenplay to be on such a level.Though Weisz and McAdams are talented actors who give the material their best effort, it's for naught as their roles are severely lacking in basic characterization - you can boil them down to ""the defiant, rebellious one"" and ""the timid, repressed one"" and you've basically got it covered. And there's barely any thematic exploration beyond the very surface-level notions of repression being negative, acceptance being positive, and the basic clash between fundamentalism and the modern era. The film drags on with very little in the way of plot or intrigue once the premise has been set up, and the overly serious tone becomes more and more suffocating as it plods along. It has a somewhat grating score as well that does not fit the material very well - lush. alternately melancholic and hopeful orchestration that reaches for a grandeur that the movie itself just doesn't justify.I'm sad to have had such a negative reaction as I really would've loved to see a great film about this subject. Unfortunately, this is really nothing more than a glorified Hallmark movie. At least they tried, I guess.Strong 1.5/5",Disobedience

If you need to know, no, I'm not gay, I didn't even feel that the gay issue in the film was of any large significance.I thought the acting, story and direction were superb. I'm really surprised more people have not found this film to be as fantastic as I did. The current IMDb rating of 6.6 seems extremely low to me. Many critics loved it, as did I. Disobedience I suppose is not a film for everyone. Overthinking can easily get in the way of this one. Just sit back and watch this subtle and beautiful film and think about it later. As the Buddha is often credited with saying, ""Think less, observe more."".I'm pretty sure many people got so offended by certain things in the film that they missed nearly all of the rich and beautiful depth that this film actually has. Sometimes the most clever truths are not so obvious, especially to the distracted mind. Scientists at this point have actually even proven the very narrow focus of the average human mind.In my view most of the greatest pieces of art in history are the pieces that challenge the way you/we look at things. This is definitely that kind of film. This is not just another piece of entertainment like much of the regurgitated and/or meaningless trash movies of our day. This truly is a beautiful piece of art; And to those of you who watched it and missed this fact...too bad for you. More than anything else, this film is about human choice, and sadly for many, that is a very scary subject. Far too scary for some to honestly deal with.

Dovid is great as is most of the supporting cast
Rachel Weisz is as always perfect and real
The biggest fault is a male director handling the sensitive and intimate scenes between two women - always always bordering on this ridiculous semi soft porn that fits into male fantasies of two women's privacy
The film lacks one major element and this is often the problem with an intimate looking into s specific world script
It lacks an authenticity even though it skated so close to it and I presume that problem lies with editors and budgets and what music to use - the soundtrack should have been richer more dramatic more dynamic.

69,gphgrm01,"Sexy, good in some details, but weak in its major points",6,30 June 2018,"Nobody will deny that erotic scenes between Rachel W. and Rachel M. are quite an asset; however, this movie is far from perfect. It seems like the movie actually does not bring much new, except for the picture of a desire forbidden in a certain community, along with the women emancipation, again, forbidden in a certain community. This is all pretty much seen in like 80% of LGBT movie, so the viewer more or less pretty much knows what every next scene will be about. There are a lot of cliches. The narration is too slow for a plot that already contains common places. The plot is actually quite explosive taken as an idea, but the script, the story in itself, does not allow characters to develop fully, they stay quite unmotivated in number of situations, and the minimalism of dialogues is not very well done.Still there are some intriguing points worth mentioning. One is a picante trigger created around Esti, the character played masterfully by Rachel McAdams, rabi's wife and school teacher, who quite happily made an escape to a reunion lesbian sex, with her ex lover, Ronnit, without much hesitation, immediately when she had a chance - the audience might expect a little bit more hesitation about it, but there was no any. After Esti's and Ronnit's conversation, we soon realize why. The shy and decent rabi's wife, actually identifies herself completely as woman-to-woman sex oriented, and she is pretty much faking her performance in her married life, simply because she enjoys other things about her status - respectable school teacher who loves her job, and loves the community she lives in. So, contrary to expectations, the rebellious Ronnit who paid a huge price for loving Esti in the early youth is not the one who is ""the queerest"" part of the story. Esti and her marriage to a childhood friend who knows his wife is into women is much more queer than Ronnit, whose is more like a sexually fluid and haunted by her father's decision to disown her, than really ""the lesbian"". This shift in expectation from these two characters is interesting, and it explains why, in the end, what exists between them is more childhood friendship and a huge sexual lust for each other, accumulated by the resistance and abstinence, than a mature love. However, the complications show up, since even faked sex with the man can bring a woman to pregnancy, and this is how Esti all of a sudden has to decide what she wants not just for herself, but also for her unborn child.Still the end of the film is its weakest part. In the end, Esti, realizing that her husband (former childhood friend) will never stop her from leaving, dismisses the idea of actual leaving with or without Ronnit and consummating the sexual and romantic freedom, or raising a child outside the Orthodox rigidity. It seems her husband's readiness to let her go if she wants so, which looks a bit hasted and non-convincing, gives her enough motivation to stay in this faked marriage, deliver the child and maintain the order, with everybody's blessing. Also, it seems that Ronnit's only real sin was not being in love with a woman at the time, but wanting to show it openly, and its not quite clear why she never openly condemns her community for expelling her for being truthful. And finally, the end in which Esti stays where she is, still sexually crazy about Ronnit, but ready to continue with her faked life, looks like a bad solution. It sends a message that a freedom to chose a faked life is more important than living a real life in accordance to your real interests and passions. To me it looks like a painful self-denial which will kill Esti this way or another. However, the movie does not acknowledge this concern, in the end everybody behaves as if Esti's choice is a smart thing to do, while Ronnit also behaves as if its understandable that her father loved Torah more than her, and never really reached out to her. In the end, there is too much abolition of the lifestyle that is so apparently so repressive for women, and pushes them to doing naughty things only in deepest secrecy. Too much of a lie for my taste.",Disobedience

73,shevaunhodge,"very ""real""",10,25 February 2019,"This film highlights the views that people still have today. Obviously the films is based mainly around the view of people with a very strong Jewish religion. However, I do not have a religion and my family are not religious, but I have still come across people with very ""set"" views on things, and that feel the need to ""force"" them on other people., with little regard for the other person. The seen where Ronit is sat at a table and the Jewish people ""grill"" her, even though her Father has just passed away. The words in this scene really hit home to me. The scene went something like this (obviously I have just written this in my words, it isn't exactly how the conversation goes) .Bitter old women (I cant remember her name) ""and you are not married, you need to find someone. It's not funny growing old alone, being married well.. that's the way it should be""Ronit ""Oh is it the way it should be? or is it just institutional obligation? I would marry whoever, then after 10 years of loveless marriage I would of killed myself, or at least felt like it"".I have learned that people who feel the need to tell people how to live there lives are usually people who are somewhat disappointed with the way theirs has gone.The heart wants what the heart wants and marriage or children wont ""cure"" this. Like Esti says ""I wanted her to come back. I wanted it to happen. Even when we were girls it was always the same. It has always been this way. I wanted it.""The sex scene was very realistic and almost felt ""real"". However, i didn't get the whole spitting in the mouth scene, but reading up about it, it seems that It could be one of two things. It could be them, in a way, mocking Jewish spitting, or it could be them doing what they used to do when they were teens. Spitting because they deemed it as sexual back then.The ending is good. It ends on a cliff hanger, making you wonder what could have happened. Overall a very good film.",Disobedience

75,Evil_Herbivore,Calm and quiet contemplation of faith and love,8,7 August 2018,"One thing needs to be said at the very beginning: Disobedience isn't a movie for everybody. I don't mean that in reference to the story, which in itself may be seen as quite controversial, as I think anyone deciding to watch the movie more or less knows what it is about. I'm talking about the pacing of the movie and the style in which it is shot. I've seen that this in a divisive issue and I can see why.To put it plainly: the movie is slow. Really slow. In a different movie with a different director the same story could have probably been told in an hour instead of two hours. For an audience used to the quick pace of modern cinema this can be a problem, but I found it wonderfully refreshing. Because the movie takes its time telling the story and building the characters, the feeling I got while watching it was that of calm and quiet. It's all the more interesting seeing that similar stories of forbidden love and faith versus sexuality are often told in a very dramatic way. In Disobedience no one shouts or even talks about their feelings and yet these feelings are still perfectly clear. This shows that with good actors, there is no need to state certain things overtly.Which leads me to acting. I really liked every single performance in the movie. Rachel Weisz is perfect as an outsider in a community that was once her own and a freethinker ready to fight for her love and freedom. Rachel McAdams is brilliant as a wife trying to both love her husband and follow the laws of her religion, and be herself and love a woman. But my favorite performance in the movie is Alessandro Nivola as a deeply hurt husband of a woman who may not really love him. All the characters are fully believable and psychologically complex, and each performance is moving in its own way.The music and the cinematography fit the story perfectly. They underline the calm feeling and add a touch of melancholy to what is quite a sad story. The coloring is quite subdued, which is perfect, as anything bright would go against the spirit of the movie.Lastly, I have to add that the movie is also a fascinating picture of the Jewish culture. I know very little about Judaism or Jewish traditions, so the opportunity to see what is looks like ""from the inside"" is really interesting, even if there are some aspects I don't fully understand.All in all, the movie is a very solid piece of cinema. It tells a complex story with using quite a minimalist technique and in my opinion the effect is very good. I would recommend it to anyone who isn't scared of a slow pace and having to read the emotions of the characters instead being told about them.",Disobedience
76,SB100,Extremely good,9,20 August 2021,"A superb film set in the Orthodox Jewish community, about freedom and choice. The film finds a way to reconcile those with religious values, although it is unlikely that everyone would agree with its conclusion. Although the community and its life is depicted in detail, there are only three main roles, and the feelings and tensions between them are very well conveyed by all the actors. Wonderful photography of the north London suburban settings in winter adds to the closed-in atmosphere.",Disobedience
77,hnapel,Charming contrast between Jewish religious rituals and girl-on-girl passion.,7,7 July 2018,"Coming out as a lesbian would already be difficult as it is in any conservatively oriented community, so if that community is an ultra orthodox Jewish clan closely affiliated even with the local synagogue that is understandably a more difficult enterprise. City mouse Ronit comes back to her old neighborhood to mourn the death of her father who was the head of the synagogue, her arrival is a surprise to most except to Esti who did in fact take the initiative to inform her of this bereavement also for her own personal desires. Esti and Ronit share a past of passion that was cut short but not drowned when Esti married Dovid, who is to success the deceased Rav, Ronits father. The movie is endearing for the often subdued but sometimes exploding electricity between the two women as they rekindle their love that is lasting but is forced to be continued separated eventually. The chemistry between the women is played out masterfully by the two lead actresses that for obscure reasons appear on the casting list as if they were mere supporting roles. That Rachel Weisz had great depth was known to me, but that Rachel McAdams had this ability surprised me, she really showed her loveliest unmasked face, far away from that usual touch of harshness. That moment your spirits are elevated when that one beloved person enters the room, whatever room even if it is a shoddy kitchen is one of the memorable scenes. Yet coming out is one thing but following through another, especially when you appear to have become pregnant from obligatory Friday sexual encounters with your devout rabbi. Not a bad man eventually but utterly naive to marry a woman from whom he should have known had different appetites. Religion can be so self deceptive. The charm of the movie is the contrast between the serious Jewish religious rituals and the girl-on-girl passionate encounters between Esti and Ronit, that should teach the zealots! In the end a dramatic story close to a happy end but not quite as Esti has gotten her freedom but with that given option decides to stay around for reasons we are left to guess and with a crying Ronit headed back to New York. Being left with such a melancholic end is unsatisfactory, as it gives us the pang of loss we all know so well.",Disobedience

80,Amonute-Matoaka,I really wanted to love it.,6,30 August 2018,"When the two actresses shared moments alone it was wonderful. Minutes dipped in sweetness and sadness, with an air of nostalgia. Not that I expected any less of them.Still, this movie was made by a man, and while it is soft, and feels sometimes like it has a woman's touch, the eye is clearly male. So the intricacies of a female friendship, the tight weaves, especially of one that evolved into a romance, are subdued. These two women would hardly waste time discussing trivial things. They would hardly need words to connect emotionally. Their dialogue should have entirely been a clash of viewpoints, with huge emotional undercurrents, love and lust stuck in a web of formalities and banned through a strict, religious upbringing.Lastly, this movie lacks a resolution. Esti married her husband to be ""cured"". While I understand her upbringing wouldn't leave her much choice, either do as your told or be an outcast, after all these years, after the fallout with her husband, after admitting she is not attracted to men, after realising she doesn't want to raise a child in such an environment, and after she is provided with an alternative, she stays with her husband because, what? He gave a freedom speech? It just didn't make any sense. She was an educated, full grown woman living in London of all places, she had options.",Disobedience
81,natalierosen-81679,Completely relatable,9,16 September 2018,"The film was about two women born into a Hassidic (Jewish ultra orthodox) community with stringent laws dictating the rigid behavior of men and women. Born into that milieu it is, indeed, torturous to have to choose one's fate as these two women Ronit and Esty who were in love with each other did. We thought the film absolutely wonderful. The acting was superb and writing of the film equally as great. Being Jewish I could relate to all of it . It did not end in any predictable way. It reminded both my partner and me of a gay women's film ""Desert Hearts"" in the mid 1980's where two women of different backgrounds fell in love and in the end had to make a choice either for one to live a straight life or live together as one. One did not know either in that film if they would end up together or separately alone but it seemed to suggest they would ultimately be together. Emphasis on ""seemed."" In ""Disobedience"" their taboo relationship probably going back many years was compounded by the married woman Esty's pregnancy. Truly, what could she do? In the end David seems accepting of Ronit but Ronit leaves for her home in NYC and Esty seems to stay with David but does she as she runs after the cab that Ronit is in on her way back to NYC and says she promises to keep Ronit appraised as to where she is. Thus, it seems it is not completely clear either what Esty will do -- remain with David the father of her soon to be child or go with Ronit the one with whom she is really in love and to whom she is attracted to live in NY. We were riveted on the subject matter, thought it profound and realistic. I could identify with much of it even if I was not raised in such a restrictive community. Being Jewish no matter what was restrictive enough and gave me many many upsetting moments when I knew a choice had to be made. Whether orthodox, conservative or reform the Jew that runs through my veins is as compelling as it was for both of these Hassidic women although admittedly it was not as difficult breaking away from the religiosity of the faith and questioning all of its ritualistic beliefs. Rachel McAdams and Rachel Weitz did a superb job in both reflecting the pull of the faith at war with the equally powerful freedom to choose one's life and whom one loves. It was a wonderful film and if one is gay or knows someone who is one I think can see the feelings behind it were so well done! We recommend it highly!",Disobedience
82,GuRUCLANdotcom,The title makes sense,2,15 November 2018,"I wanted to see this movie because from what I gathered it was going to be about a conflict with traditional values vs homosexuality in a devout religious setting and how that would play out.>>>>>>>>>>>>Spoilers<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< So basically what I took from it was that a woman would rather be in a lesbian relationship based on flesh driven desire than stay with her husband and provider and take their child, his child, just as much as it is hers, his only child and break the home, dissolve their marriage for selfish self serving hedonist reasons, rather than be a mother, home maker, wife and rib to her husband.My favorite part in this movie is when the husband grabs her and shakes her and asks ""what's wrong with you?"" Because I was wondering the same thing.
When she had an affair on her husband with that woman wasn't beautiful, it was revolting...especially the part where she dripped saliva into her mouth like semen or something.One thing I did take from the movie that the husband said, we all have the right to choose, to choose to serve our flesh or serve God, rather than try to force her to be with him and do the right thing by the vows she took, the child she was carrying, she chose to serve herself and her selfish abominable desires. It was the right thing to just let her go and wish her well....God only knows at what detriment that would be to the child.I didn't think this film was beautiful, or poignant, but rather about the sad demoralizing dismantling of a family. People don't stop and think how their actions and selfishness affects others because they are so focused on achieving their own happiness and their only thought is ""I want happiness"". But if you remove the selfishness from that concept....""I"" and ""want""...what are you left with?There is more to be gained in serving others than in just serving your own selfish desires. Sometimes you just have to tell your flesh NO! And not smoke that cigarette, and push away from the table, and deny lust. She would have gotten more out of serving her husband, and child in a family unit.And what's really insane to me is that in 2018 people will say this is a hateful way of thinking and absurd, where not 10 to 15 years ago, the majority agreed in the concept of a real family unit as Man, Woman then child in that order. Society is crumbling in to a state of degeneracy due to the dismantiling of the family unit and ruining future generations by falling into a state of chaos.",Disobedience
83,mshackletonchavez,A Great British Indie,8,15 January 2019,"Quite beautiful in so many ways, from its quiet approach, tonal mastery and class performances, this film was a great delight to behold.""No matter how long it takes. I will always love you"", this line has a great a many lines on love, between sparse sweeps of dialogue free sequences, and chanting in Hebrew. This film was highly intriguing, delivered mostly by the performances which were fed by good direction and a great screenplay.Rachel Weisz as Ronit Krushka was a wondrous performances, many have called it 'nuanced' and I agree, it is extremely well crafted, and performed. Giving the character greater depth, personality, motives, fears and emotion. Often in films with LGBT characters, they are left underdeveloped, however here it is quite the opposite. Playing what is a very unique performance that is highly memorable. A standing ovation for Rachel Weisz is due for this performance.Rachel McAdams as Esti Kuperman was a very strong performance, though I thought for her's to be inferior to Weisz's, it was still great in its own right. Her character is certainly more quiet, and more restrained, but McAdams plays this restraint and repression highly successfully, without being repetitive of other lesbian characters nor clichéd.Alessandro Nivola as Dovid Kuperman deserves much praise, although his character was somewhat in the peripheries and a third wheel for most of the film, by the latter parts of the second act and most of the third, his character was portrayed extremely compellingly. And by the end, his demeanour, arc and most importantly Nivola's performance is hard to forget.The screenplay and direction (By Sebastián Lelio) in tandem worked very well together, there was a certain sense of melancholia that was present throughout the whole feature, delivered by most likely the directors influence, it all felt very real. No part of this film felt unrealistic, and thus was highly engaging in that regard. However on the downside, at times it was a little slow, the events of this film would have run at ten to maybe twenty minutes faster, while still covering all the story with the same dramatic effect. It felt like too much bread and too little butter, although I felt this, I understand why it runs for almost two hours, and it still works at that runtime. I just felt it could have been perhaps more impactful at a slightly shortened runtime. However, some scenes do play out very slowly, and this works to a magnificent effect, in particular the opening 15 minutes, and when they visit the former fathers house as well as the final scenes in the synagogue. However other scenes did feel overly long and didn't carry the impact they were aiming for, thus if they were shortened I believe it would have benefited the feature as a whole, which is a fault of the editing. However, another effect of this is that the film ends up being extremely tonally consistent, every scene played out naturally, nothing felt out of place, which is a great achievement especially when one factors in the delicate subject matters the film deals with. Had the film of not had that restraint and consistence, it would not of had the same emotion nor dramatic effect, and maturity which it carried really very well. And thus that is a great strength of the editing, which is very strange to see it so strong is certain aspects yet more weak in others.The director of this film, Sebastián Lelio, clearly knew how ro construct his characters. As I stated before, nothing feels out of place. This film feels deeply human, and has huge punches of emotion and are long built up to by great craftsman ship, primarily the way he shaped the performances and his use of cinematography.Cinematographically this film was very interesting for a multitude of reasons. On the one hand, its angulation and framing was always on point, and delivered subliminal meaning to great effect, changing how it was held, where it was placed all to reflect and add to a scenes particular emotion, it did this to a more successful degree than most films, particularly most contemporary films.On the other hand I must hold my horses, for I could not tell wether the use of colour and lighting in this film was either the work of a master, or extremely boring and dull. Almost all of the film has a very flat, quite detached, mostly standard grey and deep blue colour palette. Which to me seems dull, but perhaps this is due to my jaded sense of colour as this is how most contemporary (Primarily big budget) films look, very dull use of colour. However I also think that this colour decision was deliberate, to reflect on the characters detachment from her community, family and religion, and to further heighten the atmosphere of melancholia and a past that many characters would prefer to forget. While I do think the way this film looks is more due to the latter, I struggled to separate this from how dull and boring so many films colour has become. And this film takes it up to eleven, it was difficult to tell if it was a very deep stylistic choice or a product of current trends. My sense was further offset when in the synagogue scenes the colour suddenly became more vibrant, more contrasted. This could be to mirror and add to emotions, or perhaps not. But overall I think for the film use of colour to be extremely clever, albeit it accidentally mirrors many of the boring current trends set by contemporary blockbusters.Overall this film was very much worth watching, it is a highly thought provoking piece, spearheaded by the top class performances. Although it lets itself down in certain aspects, in others it is extremely strong. Thus this film is worthy of its praise. It is a beautiful film, with a great love story which brings great thought and care into it delicate subject matters. In my opinion its a 8/10.",Disobedience

86,augustkellerwrites,Dignified & Wise,8,4 June 2018,"A tale of suppression, connection and liberation, Disobedience exudes respect in times of misunderstandings. Despite boiling with passion, Disobedience carries itself with stoic dignity through its measured scoring, direction and cinematography. The technical aspects of this film quietly maintain a traditional yet tense atmosphere as the cast is given room to express the depths of their skills. Rachel Weisz, Rachel McAdams, and Alessandro Nivola all show off their range and ability to build layers within their characters; filled with moments of true vulnerability, the performances in this cast are nothing short of valiant.Due to the restrained nature of Disobedience, there will be some who find the film lacking. This feeling could extend to the motivations of characters or the film's muted style. However, it is precisely this reservation which gives Disobedience its real impact. Among other themes, this film's message is about moving through conflict with honor and Disobedience leads by example. This movie may not fit everyone's tastes but it holds universal wisdom that all could benefit from. Disobedience is mature film-making done with dignity.Writing: 8/10

87,earthboli,"Interesting premise, bad finish and poor editing.",5,20 July 2018,"I wanted to like this movie. It's rare that A-list actresses sign on to play lovers, and rare to see romance between women on the big screen. But a lot of things didn't quite fit, from the editing, to the storyline, to the music, to the pacing.The score: whimsical at times, even in dramatic/tense scenes, which felt completely inappropriate. The score seemed like it belonged in a bizarre children's movie, but yet the singing scenes were very dark and sad/somber-sounding. This movie clearly took itself very seriously, so why the carnival music in parts?
The cast: good acting overall, no complaints.
The story: decent premise. A Rabbi's death brings together old flames in a strictly orthodox Jewish London community, and tensions rise, as well as feelings. But the end...no thanks.
Editing/pacing: abrupt at times and feeling disjointed, yet also slow and lingering too long in scenes that dragged. So many directors think that if you are slow and have long, tedious scenes, you will be considered a genius for being artsy and understated. That just isn't how it works.
Character development: eh. This movie really would have benefitted from more than just a few words about the past, but scenes depicting more of the history and story between the women. I want to see more depth with these women, but it does end up feeling one-dimensional due to the script and/or editing.In sum, even today, in 2018, 9 out of 10 movies about women who love each other end with suicide/murder, a woman going back to a man, a woman cheating on her partner with a man (or woman), or some other equally unforgivable outcome, and I say unforgivable because movie producers love to portray gay/bi women as tortured and unable to experience a healthy same-sex relationship. Guess which one this movie falls under, because I won't spoil it...My advice, skip this and re-watch Carol. I felt like this one wasted my time.",Disobedience

91,StoryArchitect,DISOBEDIENCE obeys the first rule of storytelling / Silver Knight Rating: 8 Cameras,8,25 May 2018,"DISOBEDIENCE is a beautiful movie. A beautiful story beautifully told. Thoughtful and sensitive. Bold and brave. Delivering emotionally satisfying surprise after surprise. Because the filmmakers know the first rule of storytelling.DISOBEDIENCE delivered the kind of emotional power that made me blissfully unable to hold back flowing tears. Tears that well up from the depths of our hearts and minds when we're overwhelmed by empathy and insight--what Robert McKee calls ""aesthetic emotion."" Uncontrollable tears evoked by the plight of the story's characters and the sight of the story's tellers. The kind of ""I can hardly breathe"" emotion I feel when I'm earthquaked by life seen through the lens of art.DISOBEDIENCE gave me what I paid for. What I hoped for. Waves of redemptive heartache and euphoria. Waves of awe-inspiring beauty and truth. The transforming power of catharsis. And as in any really good story, DISOBEDIENCE delivers a knockout punch of multiple catharses at the end. For four people: the three main characters and me. The three main characters and you, if you're lucky.And I chalk that up mainly to the great pleasure that I couldn't see the story's major turning point a mile away. Which means, I got to feel the full power of this story. Because the story's full spectrum of impact--the story's only power--flows from that major turning point and its reverberating collateral ""damage.""So if you know about the major turning point, the crux of the story, ahead of time? Well, I'm so sorry. Because that means you have to sit there knowing what's going to happen.Bummer.We don't get a second chance to feel the first impression of a story's full power. To get blindsided by a story's naked truth. To feel the deep visceral lightning strike of the eye-opening moment when a story takes a riveting unexpected turn. That magical moment when the storytellers Reveal what they have tried so hard to Conceal. Which means we don't get a second chance to experience a story the way the story designers intended for us to experience it. And feel it. Feel its full power. Its only power.So it won't come as any surprise to you that I didn't know anything about DISOBEDIENCE when I went to see it. Nothing. Only the title. And its rating: R. I wouldn't even look at the poster as I walked into the theater and made my way to my seat--because a poster usually gives something away. Nope. Just tell me the movie title and have a friend I trust encourage me to see a movie, and I go. Total blank slate.It all goes back to my days as a camp counselor.I got to tell stories around the big campfire on Saturday nights. Not a single camper wanted to know before I told them the story what it was about. Who the characters were. What happens. Somehow the 10-year old campers knew instinctively what David McKenna taught me in his Columbia University screenwriting course--the first rule of storytelling: ""The only power of a storyteller is to withhold.""The campers knew this. They knew that hearing anything about the story before I told it to them would spoil it. Anything. So they trusted that I would simply tell them the story. No synopsis. No log line. No nothin'. (No poster with a picture giving it all away like the poster for DISOBEDIENCE. Really??? Who in the marketing department made that call?) The campers and I had an unspoken contract. We respected the art of Story and our collaborative roles as teller and audience enough to let a story reveal itself--to let the story itself, through the calculated structure of its design, reveal everything an audience needs to know. And when they need to know it. The campers sitting in a circle around the campfire knew that the only power the story I was going to tell them could possibly have was surprise.Surprise.Surprise.Surprise.And most of all, surprise that comes in the form we least expect and treasure most--the type of surprise woven inextricably into the fabric of the story's soul. The type of surprise where we suddenly realize that the storyteller has now disclosed the deep secret at the heart of the story that they could have disclosed earlier but chose instead to withhold. Thank God.You deserve to feel the full power of DISOBEDIENCE. So maybe try being disobedient--don't read about the movie and who's in it before you see it. Don't find out ahead of time what the story is about. Don't look at the poster. Just kick back and let the filmmakers tell you a story. A story you'll have the sacred privilege of knowing nothing about until they tell you. Until they show you. Maybe like me, you'll be rewarded at the highest level of storytelling power.And if it's too late for you to do this for DISOBEDIENCE, why don't you try if for the next movie someone you trust encourages you to see. Picture yourself sitting around the campfire. Innocent. Hoping and trusting--praying--the camp-counselor filmmakers will tell you a story that you know nothing about ahead of time.Nothing.My Silver Knight Rating of DISOBEDIENCE--White Knight (Form): 7.0Black Knight (Story): 9.0=Silver Knight (Form & Story): 8.08 CamerasThe Silver Knight Rating scores a movie's level of play in what I call the Chess Game of Art.

95,kdlprod75018,Why did I wait this long to watch this beautiful drama?,8,15 January 2019,"Again the ratings on imdb have deceived me and I waited a while before taking a chance on this nicely crafted drama about unrequited love and second chance.
Critics and imdb ratings these days are so unreliable that I am baffled that I still rely so heavily on it, often times feeling baffled by the high ratings of some undeserving flicks vs the low ratings on other very deserving ones. Disobedience is one of those movies that deserve very high marks for succeeding in weaving tension, eroticism, drama and questions of morality and choice or lack thereof within the context of the lives of orthodox jews in modern northern london. The Rachel's (Weisz ans McAdams) are outstanding in their respective roles as angel and beast of desire as they can't help themselves at being who they are, lesbian lovers, in a community that doesn't allow for wayward behaviors. Dovid the husband is very credible and in the end shows that he would be a great 'rav'.
Like 'Blue is the warmest color', Disobedience really works as a lesbian drama. There is a lot of sexual tension and emotions conveyed between the two actresses. I never would have thought it'd work but it does. Quite a feat! The camera works is simple yet effective focusing on the 3 main protagonists are they go thru their own dilema and story arc.
In any case, if you hesitated about watching this film, don't, just watch it! It's so worth it and so much better than many of the movies rated 8+ on imdb these days. A solid 8/10 if I were to be honest in comparison to all the other landmark movies that are rated around 8/10, and 10/10 compared to many of the contemporaneous movies hailed as masterpieces that are not... A must see, unusual and unique film in a rather bland, homogenous and mundane selection of films on netflix and amazon prime these days.",Disobedience

These are the very thoughts that went through my mind when I started watching Obedience.
 I fully understand that the Jews run Hollywood, and that if a script is going to get approved it has a better shot if said script appeals to the powers that be, but in an industry where the main goal is to make money you would think they might considering changing things up a bit once in a while, perhaps even sometimes leaving religion out of it all together. More people would be able to relate to a movie like this, instead of always being slapped in the face with a subject most people are impartial to. As far as the film itself goes it really is painfully boring and slow. The actors do an adequate enough job with what they are given to work with, but really with such a contrived script unless you are one of the 15 million people mentioned in the title this film is utterly unrelatable and about as interesting as watching paint dry.

100,Jaffe,Incredible and Authentic Depiction,8,17 May 2018,"Ronit (Rachel Weisz), a single middle-aged photographer, returns to England from New York following the death of her father, an esteemed ultra-Orthodox rabbi who had been the spiritual leader of this non-Hasidic congregation and its institutions. It immediately becomes evident that due to personal issues she had left the community at a very young age and never looked back. As the story develops, we learn that Esti (Rachel McAdams), now wife of Dovid Kuperman (the departed rabbi's chief disciple and heir apparent, played by Alessandro Nivola) had struggled with similar issues alongside Ronit in their youth but had chosen a drastically different method of coping.With Ronit's return, old sentiments are dredged up in a manner that upends the lives of all three in a community that simply has not developed tools for dealing with the full spectrum of matters involving private life, nature and choice that have in recent years become so normalized that we hardly lend them so much weight.As each of the three struggle to cope with their issues, it becomes clear that there is a void in place of a guide in the doctrine of the community and that there is no one right way to cope with outlying struggles.The directing of the picture and the portrayal of the three main characters is stellar. Aside from two seven-candle menorahs (which have no place in a Jewish home), this picture stands out as perhaps the most authentic portrayal of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in motion picture history.",Disobedience

102,loobeyloo,"Well-shot, hammily-written",6,26 July 2020,"The cinematography's good, the casting's great, but having read the book first, I'm disappointed by this film.For context, the story is about a sapphic woman who, having broken away from the strict Jewish community she grew up with in London, is forced to come back to visit once her father dies. While she's there, she meets the woman she had an old tryst with.The novel had a lot more nuance, and by contrast the film unfortunately approaches the topic in a more indulgent and heavy-handed way. Hey, don't get me wrong, the sex scene was great, loved it, but it also made me laugh.It was so obvious that they were playing up the explosive nature of their erotic relationship for the big screen, playing cheesy romantic music when the two women were together, changing details like sending them away to a hotel instead of keeping it in the terraced house community the way it was in the book.It wasn't really a love story when it was a piece of literature - it was a story about the tension between human nature, the winds of change in the world, and religion. Sadly the film downplayed those deeper, meatier themes and opted to focus on sexy Rachel McAdams eating sexy Rachel Weisz' face and them spitting into each others' mouths. Which, okay. I get that.

111,mi-rakel,"Oh, what could have been",6,7 December 2018,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film because I was hoping to get an insight into the world of Orthodox Jews in north London, which is a world I know little about and a world that isn't really open to people that aren't already a part of it. Sadly is seems like the director Sebastián Lelio knows as little as me about this world. What we get is not an inside perspective of either the orthodox Jewish community or a lesbian relationship. The two main women in the film are always viewed through the male gaze. The whole sex scene between the two women which is completely cringe and stylised and seems to be screaming: look omg two women are having sex and they have all the same parts!! (Like the shot of hands in matching pants). And Esti's climax which according to a quote on IMDb's trivia page is very important for the story. I can agree with that but not with the way it's shot; in profile, slowing zooming in on her face. It's very stylised and obviously an outside perspective. It's not her own POV and it's certainly not Ronit's. It's the voyueristic male gaze. And of course, in the end they don't get to be together, as in all lesbian love stories coming out of Hollywood. The highlights of this film is the acting from Rachel McAdams, she has a few brilliant, intriguing moments. Alessandro Nivola's acting is also very good. Rachel Weisz's characters is so cliche she fails to ever become very interesting. As for the rest of the cast (well-known British faces) they just come across as Brits in wigs rather than members of the Jewish community.The story has so much potential but sadly, the film falls short.

116,Carmen1205,Powerful and passionate,9,16 August 2020,"This was a mesmerising yet heart wrenching film to watch. Ronit goes home to London, from New York to her orthodox Jewish roots to mourn the death of her father. Powerful performances from the three lead actors, especially Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams, had me totally absorbed from the outset. I ached for their wasted years. Ronit; excommunicated from her home and family, now a successful photographer, warring with her determination to live her life her as she chooses yet burdened with a sense of loss, and Esti, devoting her life to the Jewish orthodox faith, married to their childhood friend Dovid, yet suffocated by years of a suppressed sense of self and longing.Spellbound, I found myself holding my breath at the powerful electricity between the two female leads, 'masked' behind deadened facial expressions yet palpable in the fleeting glances, the long, lingering stares and then the slightest of touches shared between them. I fell in love with the two characters: Esti for her staunch commitment and vulnerability and Ronit for her strength of character.When Ronit goes to her dead father's house, accompanied by Esti, in the loaded silences, I found myself willing them to give in to each other and breathless at Esti's first tentative kiss. Later, the anticipation in their exchanged glances on the tube and as they walked through the city, had me longing too.The love scene can be summed up in one word: beautiful. No gratuitous sex or nudity here and definitely not your typical 'male oriented movie-sex'. Instead, probably one of the most touching, loving, passionate and totally erotic love scenes ever. It was not about two women having sex, it was two people in love being true to themselves and each other and a necessary and pivotal moment in the film. Esti's orgasm signifies release from years of repression and a key turning point for her - and for me when I realised that it is actually Esti and Dovid who are the characters with the greatest strength.I absolutely loved this film, adored it ...and if it wasn't for the 'in your face' song choice of 'Lovesong' by the Cure, when Ronit puts the radio on in her father's house, I would have given this 10/10...but it's still great.",Disobedience

I was just ASTOUNDED as how beyond well the acting was between the 2 Rachels. I had not known them before and I applaud them Grandly! I so wanted them to go off and be together. But the script ruined that. The way the movie was made, right away I felt like I was right there in that town experiencing each complexity. But by the end, the separation killed me. These actresses were just far too convincing for this script. I can only pray that the movie makers will make it up to me and have a Disobedience 2, Unless they plan another unhappy ending, then go ahead and keep the same two characters. But most definitely do Not include Weisz or Mc Adams. Their talent simply rose above the ""job description of these last characters."" And I couldn't buy the fact that nothing mattered more in Life than each other. They are still As One in my mind. Still my Favorite movie though. I loved the intensity, the passion, I cried hard, AND I smiled BIG and for REAL.",Disobedience

142,aphex-57610,Not your average Romance Drama,7,12 June 2019,"Came into this on the back of reading about the performances of the three main artists and I wasn't disappointed. Weisz, McAdams & Nivola each brought integrity and emotion to their characters. Nivola in particular was a standout for me.The story moved along at a reasonable pace, though I felt more time could've been spent on building the history between Robot, Esti & Dovid.
The live scene between the women was very intense, but appropriate for the story being told. It sat rather forcefully against the solemn religious setting, but that only reinforced the conflict in play.This movie probably wouldn't have jumped out at me if I were trying to pick a movie to watch. But choosing to watch out on the back of recommendations, I'm glad I did take the time to experience it.",Disobedience

145,pureheart-80504,lack of depth,6,16 May 2018,"I saw this movie twice just to make sure I understood all or most aspects of what was being conveyed. While the lead actors (Wiesz, McAdams) do a superb job in their respective roles, the story falls flat and rather staid due to underdevelopment. Trying to compromise, I chucked up the lack of answers (to the burning questions lingering in my head) with ""there probably wasn't enough money in the budget to film this or that"" Be it as it may, the capturing of certain moments really would have helped the film in fully unraveling its intent.One of my biggest issue was the character of Ronit. There was no real back story that allowed me to care or even sympathize for her (her person) Furthermore, the encased relationship that was once her and Esti had no build up upon Ronit's return. Perhaps a candid one-on-one conversation between the two women in Esti's home while the husband was out of the house (prior to their sexual/physical rekindling) could have cemented how they really felt about each other on an emotional level (I was curious to know what about Ronit made Esti fall in love with her in the first place) It would have also been interesting to know the relationship between Ronit and her father before he shunned her from the Orthodox community- this could have been helpful in understanding her rebelliousness and what looked to be a moderate form of genuine grievance from her part at the loss of her father- perhaps a conversation between Ronit and her aunt (who seemed to be the only other person aside from Dovid to have compassion for her) could have elaborated on her childhood relationship with her father.Finally, the ending- I am all for endings left to interpretation but this particular ending showed no real growth for either Esti or Ronit (individually or as a unit) I was left with the same initial feeling for both characters even after the credits rolled- no more, no less. It seems that neither of them truly had a sense of urgency to grow mostly due to the fact that their underlying internal conflict wasn't strong enough to warrant obvious change.",Disobedience
146,P_ink986,Great performance from all the cast!!! Well done,9,30 May 2018,"I was expecting the movie to be really slow and not to my taste. But I have to say I enjoyed the movie, both Rachel McAdams and Rachel Weisz have AMAZING chemistry together, the sex scene was so well done and realistic. This scene was all about Etsi and they looked so natural together. They heated up the screen!Growing up in a community with strict rules and not being able to express who you really are is the hardest thing and you feel suffocated. It was great to see Etsi grow and express who she really is. No villains in this movie and that's what I like about it, the ending could have been better as many lesbian movies are portrayed with a sad ending which is a shame. This is the only reason I have given the film 9* instead of 10*. The passion between both characters was great. Well done to both actresses.",Disobedience

148,carlcrit,Great Acting,10,1 July 2018,"A well acted film that displays three excelente performances by its two womans characters and a male one. The chemestry between the Ronit and Esti its so realistic, the looks, the breaths, the way they express their feelings of love, passion, desire, longing make it feels so human. Disobedience its a heartbreaking forbiden love history that takes place in an Ortodox Jews Community that is rule by religios traditions dictated by The Tora. This film uses a beautiful and warm palet of colors. The director Sebastian Lelio uses faces closeup planes to capture fellings and gestures that can speak to us without even using words. It shows one of the best sex scenes so far, they make it erotic and realistic without using nudity. The performance by Rachel Mcadams its outstanding, she deserves to be nominated for the awards. This film its a must see, even deserves to be on the awards nominatios.",Disobedience

151,eddieknox95,"Beautiful, emotive and honest",9,16 July 2018,"McAdams and Weisz are exceptional in these roles. The introduction of their forbidden romance is neither overly drawn out in a lazy attempt to create tension, nor is it rushed. The whole film delicately and expertly balances spine-tingling chemistry and heart-wrenching moments.Reviews that claim the film to be slow are perhaps written by those with little patience, or watching only for the love scene. Recommend watching when in a calm headspace with heaps of time to dedicate to these superb performances. It's refreshing to see a film with two queer female leads unfetishized and end with a promise of happiness.",Disobedience
152,eliguaripola,Excelent adaptation,10,8 September 2018,"Since Carol, I have not seen another film with quality and Sensibility like this.

153,kleinmoun,For me a masterpiece in acting and directing,10,26 September 2018,"I watched the movie because of the cast. Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams have never disappointed me , so I did not inform myself about the content and let the movie just affect me.
I was blown away! It's such a beautiful, quiet story with no over-the-top theatrics but still to say. There were a few moments where it could have but instead Sebastián Lelio reigns it in and opts for something more natural and quiet. He saves the big moments for when it really matters and even then he keeps it intimate. The characters feel real.
The chemistry between Weisz and McAdams is incredible. They both had their strongest moments when they were silent. Every feeling, every thought and inner conflict becomes visible. Especially McAdams has risen for me to the Best-Acting-League, Weisz was already there for me and she definitely stayed there. 
Conclusion for me: An authentic story about social constraints, inner conflicts, decisions and personal freedom that has been brilliantly implemented. Outstanding performances in a movie with a well-made ending, which I personally see more as an open end. All the characters felt real. To all the ""auntie Frumas"" outside, you're valuable and appreciated. To all the ""Rebbetzin Goldfarbs"" outside ""That's the way it should be!"" is never an argument. That's the way it should be! ;-) 
Without a doubt, one of the best movies I have seen for a while. Give the Rachels all awards! For me, this movie was a masterpiece in directing and acting.",Disobedience
