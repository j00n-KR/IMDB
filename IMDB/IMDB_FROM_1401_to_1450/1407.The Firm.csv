0,bkoganbing,Lawyer/Client Privilege,9,30 June 2007,"Tom Cruise, the All American kid from the trailer park who worked his way through Harvard Law School, just got the dream job with a prestigious white shoe law firm in Memphis, Tennessee. Sounds like he's on his way to the top with wife Jeanne Tripplehorn. But it turns out to be a nightmare. This Firm's main client is a Chicago crime family and they launder the mob's money. Now the FBI in the persons of fatherly Steven Hill and hard-nosed Ed Harris are squeezing Cruise to infiltrate and get incriminating information. That would result in disbarment for violating lawyer/client privilege. And The Firm isn't a gang of boy scouts either. They're not above a little blackmail and entrapment and they've got a security man in Wilford Brimley who's real good at it.How Tom Cruise gets out of this rock and a hard place situation is the plot of The Firm. Sydney Pollak gave him one stylish cast in support and everyone of them delivers. Even players like Gary Busey, Hal Holbrook, Gene Hackman, take essentially supporting roles because this film was a guaranteed blockbuster. All of John Grisham's novels have their own built in audience, The Firm is no exception. I do remember my mother was a devoted reader of his work, whereas I always await the film version.Holly Hunter got an Oscar nomination for her small role as private detective Gary Busey's secretary and girl Friday. When Hunter witnesses Busey's murder without the hit men knowing it, she sets the wheels in motion for the downfall of the bad guys. Hunter got nominated for Best Actress for The Piano and Best Supporting Actress for The Firm, a most unusual occurrence. She won for The Piano in 1993, but lost the Supporting Actress Award to her co-star in The Piano, Anna Paquin. Winning both would have just been a bit too much for the Academy voters.The Firm has a far fetched plot to be sure in the way that Tom Cruise brings them all down. Still that's the charm of it. It's almost Hitchcockian in its pace and mood, and even more resembles the Mission Impossible television series in the way it's all brought off. Small wonder that Tom Cruise was chosen to star in the big screen adaptations of that television classic.When I watch The Firm, I'm reminded of that line from another television classic that one Hannibal Smith used to say about he loved it when a plan comes together. That's what you will like about The Firm.",The Firm
1,SnoopyStyle,Good thriller but third act not up to standard,7,12 January 2014,"Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) is a young hot shot Harvard law graduate. Everybody is vying for him, but a small Memphis makes him an offer he couldn't refuse. His wife Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn) is suspicious but Mitch comes from a poor family and is seduced by the money. Soon, he finds troubling evidence that his firm is corrupt, and some of their lawyers are dying in suspicious circumstances.It's a tight little thriller based on a John Grisham novel. Tom Cruise is perfect as the young go getter. There are great acting talents in Jeanne Tripplehorn, Gene Hackman, Hal Holbrook, Wilford Brimley, and Ed Harris. On the other hand, Holly Hunter isn't wild enough in her role.Everything is going great. The last third is a bit too sloppy. Sydney Pollack isn't the greatest action director. The chases and the guns aren't good enough. For a third act, there is a lot of exposition. When it should be exploding, the movie is giving us an exam.",The Firm
2,Hitchcoc,Cruise Is Very Good,8,6 January 2017,"Tom Cruise has the look of a young hot-shot lawyer so he fills the Bill as a new graduate who is sought after by some of the biggest firms in the country. He ends up joining a small but very successful firm. He does this because he feels this is a path to great success in the future. When a couple young lawyers are killed, it leads to the discovery that something is amiss. Soon Cruise gets in the middle of two forces, either of which could destroy his career. One is the FBI and the other is the firm itself. The key to this is how he can separate himself from the firm without disastrous results. John Grisham is a master storyteller and his books really translate well into films. This is no exception. There are times when I really find Cruise annoying, but mostly I think he is quite a good actor.",The Firm
3,gavin6942,"Great Legal, Crime Thriller",7,16 December 2015,"A young lawyer (Tom Cruise) joins a prestigious law firm only to discover that it has a sinister dark side.Roger Ebert gave ""The Firm"" three stars out of four, remarking: ""The movie is virtually an anthology of good small character performances. The large gallery of characters makes The Firm into a convincing canvas but with a screenplay that developed the story more clearly, this might have been a superior movie, instead of just a good one with some fine performances."" I think Ebert is spot on here. The plot is pretty good, but never seems as strong as the characters. Every actor gives the full amount of their potential.For me, it was a thrill to see Tobin Bell. Cruise is great, and was apparently very athletic at this point in his career -- Paul Calderon recalls that Cruise was mountain climbing on weekends. Gene Hackman is incredible, Ed Harris is pretty good... heck, even Gary Busey performs better than usual. But Bell is great to see. I do not think he really became known before ""Saw"", and even then only by certain people. Here, he has an excellent supporting role as a hit man.",The Firm
4,lee_eisenberg,firmly implanted,8,3 July 2006,"When ""The Firm"" came out was - believe it or not - the first time that I had ever heard of Tom Cruise (although I didn't see the movie until several years later). And let me tell you, this was a great introduction. Cruise plays novice lawyer Mitch McDeere, who goes to work for a Memphis firm. With this firm, he has everything that anyone could want. But there's the question: why does everything seem so perfect? The answer lies in the firm's unseemly other side. And they're not just going to let Mitch blow their cover.Sydney Pollack pulled off everything perfectly here. It's sort of like an Ira Levin novel how everything plays out. You may be suspicious of everything after seeing this movie. Above all, it shows that Tom Cruise can actually do a good job when he tries. Also starring Jeanne Tripplehorn, Gene Hackman, Hal Holbrook, Wilford Brimley, Ed Harris, Holly Hunter, David Strathairn and Gary Busey.It's hard to believe that this was the first movie adaptation of a John Grisham novel.",The Firm
5,jboothmillard,The Firm,6,26 February 2017,"I knew about this film because of the leading actor, and I knew it was something to do with lawyers, so I hoped it would be worthwhile, based on the book by John Grisham (The Pelican Brief, The Client, A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker), directed by Sydney Pollack (They Shoot Horses, Don't They?; Tootsie, Out of Africa). Basically Harvard graduate Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) is an up-and-coming young man with a promising future in law, he is offered opportunities in law firms across America, including Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. Mitch settles on small, boutique firm Lambert & Locke in Memphis, Tennessee, which specialises in accounting and tax law, he and his wife Abby (Basic Instinct's Jeanne Tripplehorn) move. One of the firm's senior partners, Avery Tolar (Gene Hackman), becomes his mentor and introduces him to the firm's professional culture, loyalty and strict confidentiality are demanded, and lawyers should be willingness to charge exceptional fees for their services. Over time Mitch is seduced by the money, gifts and other perks showered on him and his wife, but within a couple of weeks two lawyers are savagely murdered, the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice approach Mitch and warn him that the firm he is working for is heavily involved in criminal enterprises for a Chicago mob family. Mitch is also warned that many young lawyers have been killed while employed by the firm, he soon confirms there is indeed corruption, racketeering, mail fraud, homicide and gross over-billing of clients by the firm. Mitch knows that he is trapped, he must help the authorities or face prosecution himself, or he must stay with the firm or suffer death from the firm security enforcers. Mitch and Abigail concoct a plan to hand over confidential files to expose the criminal activities of the firm to the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice, but the firm's sinister security agents, headed by chief Bill DeVasher (Wilford Brimley), are in hot pursuit of Mitch, they will stop at nothing to silence him and protect their interests. Also starring Hal Holbrook as Oliver Lambert, Terry Kinney as Lamar Quinn, Ed Harris as Wayne Tarrance, Oscar and BAFTA nominated Holly Hunter as Tammy Hemphill, David Strathairn as Ray McDeere, Gary Busey as Eddie Lomax, Steven Hill as F. Denton Voyles, Saw's Tobin Bell as The Nordic Man, Barbara Garrick as Kay Quinn, Jerry Hardin as Royce McKnight, Orphan's Margo Martindale as Nina Huff, Breaking Bad's Dean Norris as The Squat Man, Karina Lombard as Young Woman on Beach, Paul Sorvino as Tommie Morolto and Joe Viterelli as Joey Morolto. Cruise had tackled being in the courtroom in A Few Good Men, he is pretty suited as the rising young lawyer who discovers the dark side of his prestigious law firm, the star- studded cast all do their parts well also, I could just about follow the story, there are some suspenseful scenes of chases and the violent moments when the dodgy superiors get nasty, the only problem was that the film was a little long and the subject matter is a little dry, overall it is a reasonable legal thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music, Original Score for Dave Grusin. Good!",The Firm
6,ccthemovieman-1,A Complex Suspense-Drama,7,18 March 2006,"This is a long (154 minutes) but pretty solid drama-suspense story about corporate corruption. The film features a well-known cast, and as soon as the action kicks in this becomes a very tense story.Tom Cruise is very good as the hotshot lawyer, as is Jeanne Tripplehorn who plays his unhappy wife. This is a complex story at times, one not always easily understood, especially the ending. So much is explained so fast at the end it's tough to comprehend it all.Wilfred Brimley, Gene Hackman, Hal Holbrook, Holly Hunter, Robert Strathairn and Ed Harris all make this a really deep, impressive cast. For more details of the story, check some of the other reviews.",The Firm
7,rmax304823,"Nice performances, clotted plot",5,4 January 2005,"You really can't fault any of the performers here. Tom Cruise has a boyish high-school handsomeness and an unthinkingly naive demeanor to go with it. Jeanne Triplehorn has big dark soulful eyes and does and says what she's supposed to. But the lesser actors are the more interesting. And they are here in droves. Gene Hackman, the late What's-his-name Viterelli (I can only think of him as ""Jelly"" in ""Analyze This""), Holly Hunter looking sexy and sassy, a hypomanic Gary Busey who, when capable of it, really delivers, Paul Sorvino who underplays (honest), Hal Holbrook and Wilfred Brimley being nasty, poor Tobin Bell as the albino who must have played a dozen hit men and mass murderers by now, Ed Harris now with a completely shaved head, Terry Kinney as the pale blond nice guy who conceals his demons, and Steven Hill as a ruthless FBI man.The performances and the locations make this worth a dekko. This ought to be Sidney Pollack's turf alright -- corruption in a law firm and illegal activities by the authorities, the kind of polluted panorama that he often finds appealing. But somehow it doesn't come off. I haven't read John Grisham's book but it's hard to believe the plot could be as complicated as this movie. There were times when I was completely lost, especially towards the end when the firm begins to unravel and the chases and breathless phone calls start.Probably the most interesting character's is Gene Hackman's crooked but very human lawyer. His scenes with Tripplehorn are really quite good, his hesitations, awkward silences, embarrassed chuckles, and vapid smiles. His last scene with her, as he lies half drugged in bed, is outstanding.The ending is hard to swallow. Cruise gives the Feds just enough legal information to put the bad guys away for several years, based on the fact that the firm overbilled its clients and used the post office to do it, which is a federal offense. A clever move on the part of Cruise but I had a hard time visualizing these murdering wealthy perps doing any jail time. I mean, for what? For sending a client a bill that charged too much? That would put my plumber in jail, my doctor, my shrink, and a strange porno web site that I once unwittingly subscribed to -- but these guys? Nope. Even if they were convicted, I see Dershowitz handling the appeal",The Firm
8,moonspinner55,Tom Cruise not acting...just running,6,18 February 2009,"Far-fetched suit-and-tie thriller from John Grisham's bestseller concerns cocky young law student accepted into mysterious law firm, one where the mortality rate among the departing attorneys is exceptionally high. Smartly-packaged and produced, this Sydney Pollack-directed hit is crafted as a crowd-pleaser, keeping star Tom Cruise constantly on the run (as well as jumping, diving, and dodging). Too bad Cruise's big acting moment (his job interview, done in creeping close-up) rings completely false, mitigating any interest we might have had in this character. Supporting players (albeit hammy) fare a bit better, except for Jeanne Tripplehorn, cast yet again as an anxious wifey (why not make her the lead?). Outlandish, arrogant, cocksure picture will please its target audience...and Cruise's ever-faithful admirers. ** from ****",The Firm
9,BandSAboutMovies,Firm!,4,27 May 2020,"Jonathan Grisham had two books turned into movies in 1993, with the other being The Pelican Brief. This one is directed by Sydney Pollack and has a pretty big cast between Tom Cruise, Holly Hunter, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Paul Sorvino, Gary Busey and Hal Holbrook.Mitch McDeere (Cruise) is ready to graduate from Harvard when he gets an offer from small Memphis attorneys Bendini, Lambert & Locke. They ask for strict loyalty and confidentiality. They charge their clients high fees, which Mitch loves, because he gets an amazing house, a new car and his student loans all paid off.He learns the secret that not all of their clients are legal, so Wilfred Brimley gets him laid and uses the photos to keep him in line. Cruise's character, however, can't deal with it all and decides to go to the feds, who are just as shady as the criminals.In the original script, Mitch is killed.

He is approached by Bendini, Lambert and Locke.He and his wife, Abigail or Abby,played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, move to Memphis, where it is located. Avery Tolar,played by Gene Hackman becomes his mentor.He was offered with lots of money and showered with lots of gifts and benefits, including a house and car,he is at first totally has no knowledge to the more sinister side of his company. Then, two associates are murdered. The FBI contact him, asking him for information and informing him that not that the film is connected connected to the mob. Aside from that,every associate that has ever tried to leave was murdered. His life as he knows it is forever changed. He has a choice: work with the FBI and risk being discovered by or stay with his employer knowing that at sometime he will get involved with laundering mob money and in the end go to jail. He then devises a plan that allows him to cooperate with the FBI by finding proof that all partners were guilty of over billing, while at the same time reaching an agreement with the Morolto brothers. Aside from that,he manages to do so without breaking any laws, thereby being able to keep his status as a lawyer.In the end,the McDeeres leave their house in Memphis for Boston, driving the same car they arrived in.The movie's story isn't as powerful as the book as it played it safe for the character of Mitch McDeere. That is why it never stood out in my opinion as one of the best John Grisham novels that were turned into movies unlike The Rainmaker and The Chamber.But nevertheless,the acting was decent with Tom Cruise,Gene Hackman, Ed Harris,David Strathairn and Holly Hunter.It was also entertaining in a good way but not as great as the book.",The Firm
11,LeonLouisRicci,Disappointing,5,16 October 2013,"After an Intriguing Set-Up of a Harvard Law School Graduate's Recruitment into a Too-Good-To-Be-True Law Firm that Utilizes a ""We are all Family"" Slogan things start going Downhill at a rather Sluggish Pace as though some On-Set Billing Hours needed Padding. But this is no Devil's Advocate (1997). It could have been, but is nothing more than a So-What Mediocrity.It is a Movie Populated with a Number of Recognizable Supporting Characters trying to keep things Propped Up with some Working Overtime to make this more Interesting than it is. But it is just those that keep this from Falling completely Flat. Aside from one Woeful Miscasting (Security Chief) , the rest Deliver some Punch to this Otherwise Long, Wordy, and Confusing Story.The Ending is most Anemic as things Grind to Halt Abruptly, and without much Advocacy. Some may find this a Tolerable Semi-Thriller, like Fans of the Novel's Author, or Tom Cruise Groupies, but others may say"" What's all the fuss about?"". After all, this was a Mega-Best-Seller and a Mega-Budgeted Movie, but there is a Case to be made that could require some Deliberation as to what went wrong.",The Firm
12,Calicodreamin,Not bad,6,22 July 2020,"A well cast and well acted suspense, though it falls a bit short in the end.

Overall not bad, but a bit anticlimactic.",The Firm
13,view_and_review,"""The Firm"" means their grip on their employees",8,20 April 2020,"A year after playing a lawyer going after the U.S.M.C., Tom Cruise plays a lawyer going after his own firm.""The Firm,"" as it were, was Bandini, Lambert, and Locke; a small law firm in Memphis, Tennessee. They recruited Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) heavily and threw so much cash and perks at him that he dare not refuse. Of course, this law firm was a little bit different than most. If you start with an assumption that all law firms are at least a little bit crooked, then this firm would still be among the crookedest.It doesn't take long to find out how bad the firm is. McDeere's mentor, Avery Tolar (Gene Hackman), gave him a taste of it early on. The thing about the firm is that no one leaves the firm... well, not alive anyway. So McDeere has to figure out how he can leave the firm, satisfy the F.B.I.'s thirst, and keep himself and his family alive. It's an unenviable position.The movie keeps the pressure on with very few relief moments. McDeere is being converged upon by the firm's henchman in Bill (Wilford Brimley) and the F.B.I.'s attack dog in Agent Wayne Tarrance (Ed Harris). You can almost see the gears in McDeere's head turning as he tries to figure out how to get out of his impossible situation. One thing is for sure---he won't be able to do it alone. He'll need all the assistance he can get, even if he's not aware of it. But, behind every good man is a good woman, and in this case there are two: wifey (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and helpful secretary (Holly Hunter).",The Firm
14,neil-476,Love that ending!,8,7 February 2011,"The Firm is a solid adaptation of one of John Grisham's legal potboilers. The film is more successful than the book in my view - it is very accessible (perhaps due to the large, and excellent, ensemble cast), whereas I found the book stodgy.Where the film really wins, however, is in its ending. Protagonist Mitch, seduced by the mafia-backed Firm, and blackmailed by the FBI, is in an impossible position - either he caves in to the FBI and is forever at risk from the Mafia (not to mention betraying his legal ethics, for this young lawyer is truly ethical), or he refuses to co-operate with the FBI, and goes to jail.The movie Mitch finds a third way which enables him to turn his employers over to the FBI and thus get himself of that hook, establish an effective shield to protect himself from the Mafia, and retain his legal ethics to boot. Brilliant! One of the most satisfying movie endings ever, and far more satisfactory than the novel, where Mitch simply caves.",The Firm
15,evanston_dad,At Least It's Got Holly Hunter,4,10 February 2009,"""The Firm"" is the only John Grisham book I've ever read, and while I remember barely anything about it, I remember that the movie version veered far away from the plot of the book as it reached its climax.I also remember that the film is flabby, far too long and has one of the most annoying piano scores I've ever heard in a film. This belongs to Tom Cruise's cocky wonder-boy period (or wait, maybe he's still in that period).What I remember most about this movie is the performance of Holly Hunter in a tiny role as a secretary. She acts like she's in a totally different movie, and that's a good thing. She brings some pizazz to all of the cloak and dagger hoo-ha.Grade: C",The Firm
16,Uriah43,An Intricate Legal Drama,7,23 August 2021,"The film begins with a young college graduate from Harvard Law School by the name of ""Mitch McDeere"" (Tom Cruise) being interviewed by several top law firms due to his outstanding academic achievements. He eventually accepts a position from one in Memphis known as Bendini, Lambert and Locke which offers him an incredible financial package which includes a low-interest mortgage on a beautiful house. However, in his excitement with landing this lucrative deal he misses several small signs which indicate that there is more to this law firm than meets the eye-and they have absolutely no qualms about committing all kinds of illegal activities whenever it suits their purposes. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an intricate legal drama which sometimes presented complex situations without enough time for the viewer to fully absorb all of the minute details. Fortunately, the ending presents some clarification-so it all works out well enough for the most part. As far as the acting was concerned, I liked the performances of both Tom Cruise and Jeanne Tripplehorn (as Mitch's wife ""Abby McDeere"") along with that of Gene Hackman (""Avery Tovar"") to a lesser extent. In any case, I found this to be an entertaining movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",The Firm

18,Wuchakk,When paradise turns into nightmare,9,24 May 2018,"RELEASED IN 1993 and directed by Sydney Pollack based on John Grisham's novel, ""The Firm"" is a crime drama/thriller starring Tom Cruise as a top Harvard grad lawyer who desperately wants to leave behind his working-class origins and takes a high-paying job at a firm in Memphis. He and his wife (Jeanne Tripplehorn) are ecstatic in their affluent new world until clues mount up that the firm has a sinister side. Gene Hackman plays his mentor at the firm while Ed Harris appears as an FBI agent. Holly Hunter, Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn and Gary Busey are also on hand.This has long been one of my favorites from this genre. You really feel for McDeere (Cruise) & his wife as their utopia morphs into an inescapable hell. In the Washington DC scene you grasp how limited their choices are as they're caught in a crossfire between the Mob and the FBI. McDeere must use his wits, his knowledge and ""golden connections"" for them to get out unscathed, if possible. I always favored the piano score by Dave Grusin, which some have described as ""bouncy."" While you could call it that, it has different tones depending on the sequence. For instance, during the closing city chase it's driving and portentous. There's also a melancholic component when suitable. The positive side of the piano score is that it makes the film timeless. Consider quality movies from that general era which were horribly dated by conventional scores, like ""No Way Out"" (1987).

Based on the attractiveness of the offer and on their stated devotion to ""family,"" McDeere chooses to join a law firm in Memphis, Tennessee. Upon their arrival, Mitch's wife Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorne) becomes uncomfortable as she speaks to the wife of one of her husband's new colleagues and gets told that ""the firm"" doesn't ""forbid"" wives from taking jobs, but it ""encourages"" children. Why is ""the firm"" so obsessed with controlling the personal lives of its lawyers and their families? It's a mystery, and could have been a good one.From here on it's difficult to talk about this movie without a few spoilers. After two hours of murder, mystery and intrigue in which we watch Tom Cruise running desperately away from bad guys over and over again, we discover that all the mystery (and all the murders) stem from the fact that ""the firm"" is overbilling its clients! That's it! They're overbilling! Nothing more. A pity, really, because the premise did have promise starting out.The movie was further weakened by the introduction of so many characters. We have to keep up with the McDeere's, with the law partners, the black sheep brother, the FBI agents, the private investigator and his secretary. Too much. Perhaps this works in Grisham's novel (which is a very different medium) but it does not work in a two and a half hour movie.There was a decent enough performance from Gene Hackman as Avery Tolar(McDeere's mentor), which was counter-balanced by trying to believe Wilford Brimley as ""the firm's"" security director.In the end, a lot of promise leading up to very little. 4/10.",The Firm

The start of the story, of a hotshot young lawyer (Tom Cruise) who finds himself caught up in dodgy dealings, is a fast-paced, yuppie nightmare that unfolds with some skill. But when the brilliant Cruise decides to turn the tables on his employers, the mob, and the F.B.I. and starts to play his own game, the film descends into predictable, though unlikely, cliché.

26,g-bodyl,Not All Lawyers Are Legal......,8,5 October 2014,"Back in the early 1990's, movies based on lawyers and law were everything, so it's no surprise that many of John Grisham's books were adapted into screen during this time, including this movie The Firm. The Firm is actually a really tense, character-driven thriller that works despite a stuffy running time and a very confusing plot(especially the last half-hour.) The screenplay is effective, but kudos to those who can follow the entirety of the plot because it was hard to follow at times.Sydney Pollack's film is about this very smart man who is on the cusp of graduating from Harvard when he is offered a package at this law firm in Memphis which can afford him an affluent lifestyle. But little does he know the firm has a sinister side. When the FBI talks to him about the firm and asks him to be an insider, Mitch McDeere's life will be forever changed.This film has a well-rounded cast and everyone is put to good use. Tom Cruise does a great job using brain and muscle to sort things out. Gene Hackman does a great job as his flawed, but kind character. Jeanne Tripplehorn is effective as Mitch's wife, Abby. We also get smaller key performances from Ed Harris as the FBI investigator and David Strathairn as Mitch's older brother, Ray who is serving time for manslaughter.Overall, The Firm is a very interesting movie. The plot is all over the place and the film runs over two and a half hours, but the film never becomes boring and it's not all that hard to put the pieces together. I also like the jazzy piano score by Dave Grusin. It sounds upbeat at times, but it adds to the film. A very suspenseful thriller and I was surprised how fast my heart was beating in the three-way battle between Mitch, the FBI, and the Firm. I rate this film 8/10.",The Firm
27,lesleyharris30,"Not Exciting Enough To Be This Long,",6,29 July 2013,"The Firm is a decent movie with a promising storyline that dosen't really deliver.The movie certainly shouldn't be called a thriller,it wasn't very exciting and it wasn't something that I couldn't keep my eye away from.I was impressed with Tom Cruise,Jeanne Tripplehorn,Gene Hackman and Ed Harris performances and their probably the only reason why this score isn't much lower,because their all just very talented and did the best they possibly could with this overall dull and boring movie.I wouldn't recommend the Firm,especially not to fans of thriller's,it isn't exciting as the story makes it seem,and it is dragged out way too much,with two hours and a half,and it gets boring after about the first hour.The movie is too plain,simple and long but fans of these actors will appreciate their performances.Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise),a trained lawyer,joins a prestigious law firm only to discover their business is dangerously shady.",The Firm
28,secondtake,Can a thriller about lawyers thrill? Beware a plot filled with technical twists.,7,25 May 2010,"The Firm (1993)The twist in the plot as you realize this Memphis law firm is not what it seems, and the rather innocent freshman lawyer played by Tom Cruise is slow to catch on, is the core of the movie, and a relief. It starts steadily, or slowly, depending on your patience, and in fact plays many scenes out in more detail than we need for a kind of bookish thriller. It's not a bad ride, and there are some further, minor twists, but it's not packed tightly enough, or frankly original enough, to lift its boots out of the sand.Director Sydney Pollack, hugely successful as a director and actor, might have just had bad scriptwriting here by David Rabe, because John Grisham's book had proved itself. The acting is really solid (I'm no Cruise fan, but he's fine), but the characters are often doing things that just don't quite follow, or that are improbable or stupid. Or they end up doing something dangerous and the danger is either watered down or ridiculous. Examples that come to mind are how they show Cruise discovering or stealing or xeroxing files. We get the plot, but it lumbers along, or is just shown, not built up with suspense. The cinematographer takes a hit here, I think. Things are often nicely framed and routinely well done, but a thriller needs to hide some things, show some things, create ambiance and mystery, and so on, visually. It doesn't really happen.So, for a kind of technical high-stakes, rich person's good-guy bad-guy suspense film, it will get you through, but barely. By the last five minutes, if you aren't sucked in, you'll want to scream ""hurry up!""",The Firm

All the characters are awesome, and the story is excellent as well, plus Tom Cruise is simply amazing in this!. It has a wonderful cast, and even at 154 minutes I didn't find it to be overlong, plus it also had some great twists and turns as well. Gene Hackman is fantastic in his role, and I thought Cruise and Jeanne Tripplehorn had very good chemistry together, plus the finale is extremely suspenseful and tense. It's very well written and made, and while patience is required at times, it's never boring, and always engaging, plus Holly Hunter is terrific in her role. It will always keep you guessing throughout, and it's also quite creative as well, plus Sydney Pollack has another excellent film that he can add to his resume. It had some exciting chase scenes, and this role is ideally made for Cruise, plus I liked the ending as well. This should be higher then 6.6 in my opinion, and all the characters are extremely likable, plus Cruise and Ed Harris had some brilliant and intense scenes together. This is an excellent thriller, that's very suspenseful and involving, with a great story, and superb performances, and I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is excellent!. Sydney Pollack does an excellent job! here, with awesome camera work, great angles and just keeping the film suspenseful and at a very engrossing pace. The Acting is top notch!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, as always had tons of charisma, had a role that was ideally made for him (a cocky young hot shot lawyer), was focused, had very good chemistry with Tripplehorn, was fantastic in the action scenes, and he can add another brilliant performance here to add to his resume as well! (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!). Jeanne Tripplehorn is very solid here as Cruise's wife, she is pretty likable, and did a very good job, it was actually rather difficult role, and she pulled it off just fine, I really liked her. Gene Hackman is fantastic here, he had an unpredictable character, was likable, and as usual didn't know what to expect from him, he was just perfect for this role. Hal Holbrook does what he has to do well, and added class. Ed Harris is brilliant in his role here, he had some seriously awesome scenes with Cruise, as they were one of the true highlights of the film, he had a great role!, I loved him. Holly Hunter is top notch here, she deserved her Oscar, and really impressed me a lot. David Strathairn is good as Cruise's brother, I dug him. Gary Busey is excellent in his couple scenes, too bad we didn't get time to know his character well enough. Paul Sorvino has a good cameo near the end. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5",The Firm
30,atlasmb,An Intelligent Thriller,8,15 March 2021,"Another great film by Sydney Pollack, ""The Firm"" is a thriller with excellent pacing. The narrative is somewhat complicated, but the action remains comprehensible as Tom Cruise leads a very strong cast. Gene Hackman, in particular, delivers a nuanced performance of a man who is both a conspirator and a victim of his own conspiracy. Cruise is the new, talented attorney who gets (an unwanted) peak behind the curtain of the corporate façade.Like other John Grisham adaptations, this one is intelligent and engaging. Though others may disagree, for me the Dave Gruisin score adds an appropriate note of sophistication to the film.I have watched ""The Firm"" repeatedly over the years. A good companion to this film is ""The Devil's Advocate"" starring Keanu Reeves.",The Firm
31,The-Sarkologist,When the dream job turns sour,6,5 February 2012,"The Firm is a thriller. It is about a young and brilliant lawyer Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) who is just graduated with honours out of Havard University and has many opportunities before him, so he takes the one that looks the best -- and that one was a mistake. Unfortunately, I cannot give too much away about the movie because if I do I would spoil it. I will try to examine the movie as well as possible without saying anything.Throughout the movie we know as much as Mitch knows, and no more. There are some things that are revealed to us but Mitch realises this already. We are told a couple of things just so that we understand, but I feel that it could have been done with out this knowledge being revealed. When we first enter the firm we see it as a friendly place where everybody is close and like a family, but when we begin to look deeper we notice that it is not all that it seems. The first hint is when they say that the Firm is like a family; though one would consider any firm saying that they are like a family.Mitch McDeere is the main character in the firm. He is an innocent man, more like a boy, having just come out of law school. He neither understands faithfulness for not only does he cheat on his wife, but he steals somebody else's wife. Mitch wants to be free: when asked why he became a lawyer he tells us it is because when he was young, he watched the pizza shop that he worked for go under because the owner mucked up on his tax return. Thus in this movie he finds himself trapped, being torn by two forces that he hates and looking for a way out. Mitch is a very self-centred man; we learn that he has a mother whom he never sees and he only goes and sees his brother when he needs help. What does seem to change is that when he realises that he is trapped and it looks like he has lost anything, his brother seems to be the only body that he cares about. Yet it looks that he did care somewhat for his brother, but not until he had nowhere else to turn. Even so, he still had nothing to do with his mother and it is actually through Aggie's mouth that we learn that he has a mother.Avery (Gene Hackman) is one of the other major characters. Gene Hackman plays a brilliant bad guy (I don't think that he really suits good guys). The nature of his character changes through the movie. It is not possible to go in too deep because it will probably give away too much. Avery is Mitch's mentor, and he sort of guides him through the first part of the movie.The Firm is a very good movie with a very unravelling plot. My only gripe is that Mitch runs off with Aggie who happens to be married to somebody else. There is a distinct lack of faithfulness shown in this movie but then Mitch is faithful to very few people and has little faith in anybody else. Mitchel McDeere is definitely not a role model and should not be treated as one.",The Firm
32,slightlymad22,"Great Performances From A Great Cast, But A Tad Too Long.",8,28 September 2017,"Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to The Firm (1993)Plot In A Paragraph: Young lawyerMitch McDeere (Cruise) joins a prestigious law firm only to discover that it has a sinister dark side.After two underperforming movies in a row, Cruise is back with two back to back big hits. Personally I think this is a little too long. This is a really good movie with some great performances, but it should have been a great movie. I don't have a problem with long movies (I actually prefer them) but this movie didn't warrant such a long run time. With a bit of trimming and a tighter screenplay this would be a classic.This features a great Crusie performance Gene Hackman is his usual brilliant self Hal Holbrook is as reliable as always, Ed Harris is very disturbing looking with his bald head, Wifred Burnley makes a surprisingly convincing bad guy. Jeanne Tripplehorn is fine, Gary Busey has a role as a very small role as a private eye, and Paul Sorvino has an even smaller one. Holly Hunter was Oscar nominated for her small role. The Firm grossed $158million at the domestic box office, to end the year the 4th highest grossing movie of 1993.",The Firm
33,sol-,Paranoia Thriller,7,30 April 2016,"Invited to join a mysterious legal firm on a high salary, a law school graduate begins to suspect that something is amiss in this riveting Tom Cruise movie. The firm acts like a cult: every member is happily married, they encourage wives to have children, profess conformity to traditional values... and ten percent of lawyers who have worked there have died in horrific accidents. No lawyers have ever left either (at least not alive). This intriguing premise comes from the pen of John Grisham, and as the film veers off into speechmaking near the end with Cruise talking about learning to ""discover the law again"", Grisham's mark is noticeable. Sydney Pollack has the directing chair though, and much like with 'Three Days of the Condor', Pollack spins a superb paranoia thriller from Grisham's story with limited dialogue and instead focus on establishing a foreboding presence within the firm. There is an unshakable sense of unchecked malice in several scenes. A strong supporting cast helps, though not everyone is in top form. An always wide-eyed Jeanne Tripplehorn has zero chemistry with Cruise and makes an odd choice for his wife. Gary Busey is also little more than himself. Hal Holbrook renders his character fantastically menacing though and Wilford Brimley sends chills down the spine as a security director of sorts for the firm. At two and a half hours, the film sounds a bit on the long side, but it is gripping all the way.",The Firm

I also liked the interpretations of Tom Cruise who played as Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman who played as Avery Tolar and Jeanne Tripplehorn who played as Abby McDeere and they were all simply amazing. The direction which was made by Sydney Pollack was good and I believe that he did a great job. This movie it could be better if it was not above two hours because in some points it was a bit tiring.",The Firm
35,Dr_Coulardeau,Lawyers are honest crooks,10,5 August 2010,"Some would call that a legal thriller but that would be reducing it too much because there is little court action, in fact, there is no court action. It is all about how you can fool the FBI, get your feet out of the rich mud in which they are, and at the same time, remain absolutely true to your oath as a lawyer when you were registered, sworn in to be more precise, to the local bar, here Memphis, Tennessee, or is it generic?But it is a very good film on one legal loophole in our society.A lawyer knows about the crimes of his clients and if these clients are criminals what can the lawyer do when he is under the menace of being killed if he stops doing his ""good"" job. That's the first interest of the film. Lawyers cannot because of their oath do anything against a criminal client, and yet it is their legal duty to do something, at least to defend him if he is prosecuted. But what bout if he is not prosecuted?So, it will have to be like for Al Capone, a collateral problem that has nothing to do with the business of the client, or so little. That's the real loophole of our legal system. Everyone has the absolute legal obligation to report a crime they know about, except lawyers, and priests, and even doctors, and quite a few more, be it only if it, goes against their religious convictions, and that is immoral, even if it has to do with your religious convictions.A lawyer has to defend his client. An accused criminal has to be defended in court the best way possible. But hiding the crime you know about is not defending, it is concealing. Our society has some kind of a flaw there, and it goes back a long way. Is our justice really equal for all and just for all, victims, and criminals alike? So, if you cannot report the crimes of your clients, you can bring down a law firm that exploits these criminals by overcharging them, in fact secretly blackmailing them into paying a lot more than they should, and then laundering this money into some fiscal paradise like the Caymans Islands. But that is a myth. You can bring one law firm down, but another one will start the business again, the exploiting, and the blackmailing, and the overcharging, and the laundering, and the fiscal paradise. There will always be some crooked law firm to speculate on organized crime - more or less with the consent of the criminal clients: better pay too much and be protected than pay the right fee and be naked, nude, and bare in front of the FBI.The second interest of the film is the super-exploitation young lawyers can be the targets or the victims of. They are ""bought"" by some law firms with millions of money and merchandise just to be over-exploited for a certain amount of time, for doing what they are asked to do; for keeping their mouths shut, including inside the firm; for being the subservient servile servants of their older partners.The wives are demanded to be their wives and that's all, and that's hard enough, waiting for them at night when they work late; worrying, but not too much, when there is something strange; caressing and cajoling the ""Dearies"" when they go through a difficult period; to the endless extremity of an etc. This profession in this society is essentially misogynistic. What about women lawyers today?Then the film shows how the famous Cayman Islands were used in those days as a haven for business, crime, tax evasion, speculation, prostitution, and many other options in evil doing.Finally, it also shows how justice can be short-circuited by the simple system of ""parole"" and turned into a means to pressurize one person by paroling or not paroling another.The film is well built, full of resources, action too (the actors run too fast: they must have very good stuntmen, or they speed up the film when editing it), and rather moral in the end, even if the main criminals will go on running, in that case, the mafia and their lawyers. Our society is so hypocritical. Shedding crocodile tears all the time on the poor little poor destitute people who suffer so much. Let me give you twenty euros or twenty dollars for you to go to the restaurant and forget about your misery.And during that time millions are circulating as speculative profit or back shish under the cover or the table. That's how some nerve agent or poison can probably end up in your underwear, under the cover or the desk (one case in the film but the nerve agent is a big caliber bullet).Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",The Firm
36,zkonedog,"Hollywood Slick, But Still Makes You Think",7,8 March 2017,"There are a lot of positives ""The Firm"" has going for it: great ensemble cast, intriguing lawyer/business plot line, & great ending that comes out of nowhere. Despite being a very ""slick"" Hollywood production, those ""plusses"" make the film interesting enough to enjoy from beginning to end.For a basic plot summary, ""The Firm"" sees young lawyer Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) & his wife Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn) courted in a prestigious fashion by a Memphis law firm. After being paired with mentor Avery Tolar (Gene Hackman), however, Mitch & Abby begin to put together the dark secret behind the existence of the firm...one which ultimately involves the FBI and much business intrigue.The plot of ""The Firm"" is its hallmark, to be sure. There are enough twists and turns to keep you interested from start to finish, and you'll never quite guess what might happen next. There are many business-ethics issues in play throughout the entire film, all of which are navigated very perceptively by director Sydney Pollack.The acting is also top-notch (if not a bit over-the-top at times). Besides those mentioned above, other names like Ed Harris, Hal Holbrook, Wilford Brimley, Gary Busey, & Tobin Bell turn in good showings. There is hardly a dull scene in the entire experience thanks in large part of this enlarged acting crew.Thus, ""The Firm"" is a good ""lawyer intrigue"" movie that fails to rise to the status of, say, ""A Few Good Men"". It is very comparable to ""The Devil's Advocate"" in both overall success & material. A 3.5 star rating would be my exact choice, but I'll give this one the benefit of the doubt due to the plot-twists that surprised me and an ending that had me feel it was all worthwhile.",The Firm

So after denouncing Christmas conformism and neighbors pressure, here he explains the prestige of law firms. When all other movies stop at their brilliant career and consider them as wealthy saints, those lawyers are just crooks, criminals, killers who knows how to lure and trap partners into their scheme ! So for sure it's original and in a way, the firm has offer the same devilish promise of a prestigious career than Al offers Keanu in the « devil's advocate ». The cast is really prestigious from always convincing Cruise to old tutor Gene, to dark Harris. Even the less important parts are well filled with « Deep throat », Don Sorvino, Busey and for sure Holly Hunter ! At first, you expect that she has very limited screen time but finally she becomes an essential player and she really gives originality and punch to a character would could have been transparent. The movie offers many outdoors locations as well and the sets are really beautiful (the firm building for example) and Pollack with his old style doesn't give us headaches with violent editing !

Mrs. Shullivan was late coming home while the film was underway and it immediately caught her undivided attention even though she missed the first half of the film. So captivating was the story line about a top notch Memphis law firm who launders money for the mob, and as the young lawyers serve their purpose are each mysteriously found dead under even more suspicious circumstances.Tom Cruise plays Mitch McDeere, who just graduated with honors second in his class from Harvard University and is the next ""chosen one"" for the small Memphis firm who woos the wonder boy with a healthy starting salary, a sports car as well as a house. His assigned mentor is the smooth talking Avery Tolar (Gene Hackman) who immediately takes wonder boy Mitch to the Bahamas to close his first big investment deal.To complete the perfect life, Mitch needs the perfect wife who happens to be the independent wealthy heir Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn) who is not hypnotized by their sudden wealth (as Mitch is) as she comes from a family of wealth.

39,Anonymous_Maxine,An excellent legal thriller. One of Tom Cruise's best performances.,9,14 March 2001,"In The Firm, Tom Cruise plays an extremely intelligent young lawyer who takes a job with a tremendous firm, having been seduced by their huge financial offerings. ""The Firm"" begins to sound very creepy very early in the film, when it becomes known that 'the firm' has never had a divorce, 'the firm' encourages children,' 'the firm' is a big, happy, 41 member family. Unfortunately, it seems that another interesting little side note is that no one has ever left 'the firm' and lived.Mitch McDeere (Cruise) is hired by 'the firm,' and at first, everything is great. The firm loves him enough to pay back all of his student loans all at once, and he is completely taken in by everything, even down to the way that the firm furnished his new house, in his beautiful new neighborhood ('To make you feel at home. Hope you don't mind.'). The lives of Mitch and his wife Abby (Jeanne Triplehorn) are completely and drastically changed when he is hired by the firm, setting up a disorienting atmosphere, especially when strange things start happening, people getting killed by boat bombs and whatnot.Gary Busey plays a small, seedy role, and it works really well because he's best at playing seedy characters. Ed Harris also delivers a good performance as an FBI agent trying to coerce McDeere into helping them investigate the big bad firm. It seems that McDeere has been helping the firm in its illegal activities, making him guilty without him even knowing about it. If he doesn't help the FBI, he'll go to jail with the other 40 members of that big, happy family.The Firm really gets going once McDeere starts trying to investigate, making copies of incriminating files, etc. Some things may have gone a little too far, like the conveniently placed pillow truck, but as a whole, The Firm is a great thriller. It may not be quite as good as other John Grisham adaptations, The Rainmaker, in particular, but The Firm's complex and fascinating plot, as well as good direction and acting, makes it way above average.",The Firm

What a magnificent thrilling story. It starts out gentle and slow, yet ends with a gutwrenching suspenseful final.Maybe not suited for ADD popcorn lovers without any patience, because this movie is all about intelligent schemes that will take up a lot of time before things start happening. It is therefore definitely NOT a straight action movie, no way. Thankfully it is not I would dare to say. This is something else.

Tom Cruise is a young and brilliant lawyer student. Straight out of university he gets offered a job too good to be true: working for the highest paying law firm of the country. But not is all as rosey as it seems at first and soon Tom Cruise finds out his employer is dealing in shady business. How shady and corrupt you will find out yourself when you start watching this classic.And a CLASSIC it is, because I have seen this movie many many times over the last decades and it just stays as riveting and suspenseful as during the first watch. How is that possible? Well, all thanks are due to an excellent story by Robert Towne among others. A very intelligent story, which most wont even understand, because it has got so many intelligent layers. That doesnt distract from the suspense though, that stays riveting from beginning till the end...But most of all producer AND director Sidney Pollack (""Out of Africa"", ""3 days of the Condor"") must be thanked, because this man has brought together a bunch of talents that made this story into one of the best suspense thrillers EVER!",The Firm
41,jzappa,"If It Sounds Too Good To Be True, It Probably Is.",8,28 May 2010,"In this excitingly convoluted genre piece by Sydney Pollack---who blossomed into a straightforwardly commercial director who was happily a part of the commercial mainstream, unlike such surviving contemporaries as Sidney Lumet and Woody Allen---Tom Cruise plays Mitch McDeere, a poor boy who is embarrassed by his meager roots now that he has graduated from Harvard Law fifth in his class. He gets offers from the top law firms in New York and Chicago, yet ultimately opts for a smaller firm stationed in Memphis. His choice is money-minded. He regards money as peace of mind, however later in the film he is less certain than he's ever been of how flush he'd need to have to be truly at peace.Some movies about the law reduce the judiciary elements to the rank of incidental. This one squeezes them for all they're worth. Without betraying too much of the story, I can say that McDeere is soon enough being blackmailed by both the FBI and the firm's security chief, grizzled and mild Wilford Brimley, quite compelling in an unusual jaunt as a bad guy. To protect himself, Mitch has to exercise both mind and body, eluding hit men and outwitting lawyers, to save both his life and his license to practice law.Drawn from the novel by John Grisham, as adapted by three of the most high-priced screenwriters at the time, this star-studded suspense melodrama takes an admirable two and a half hours to work its way through a hair-splitting ethical hodgepodge. By the finale, regardless of McDeere's gasping expounding during phone calls in the middle of a chase sequence, his plan of action is bewildering. And then there is the one character who never saw two particular killers when she witnessed another character's death because she was totally enclosed and hidden, which is how she survived, but in a later scene with Mitch, she says she saw the killers and details what they looked like, even the color of one's eyes, the one actually being an albino. However, it doesn't seem as far-fetched as it would were the style of the movie not as competent even when the fine points were bleary.Sydney Pollack, usually a solid director of easy-going entertainment, liked to make big, demanding movies and he was secure working with huge stars. Whether or not that colors his movies with a sugar-coated worthiness, he utilized them as abbreviated exposition. Case in point: One glance at Hal Holbrook as the top dog of the Firm and we sense it's a suspicious organization. Holbrook almost always plays the ostensibly dignified man with skeletons in his closet. One look at Gene Hackman, as the law partner who becomes Cruise's coach, and we know he's an incredibly faulty yet essentially not such a bad man, as he always is. One look at Cruise and we get a complacent feeling, because he is, in lots of his roles, just a little slow to figure things out. His characters appear to trust people too readily, and so it seems authentic when he accepts the Firm's song and dance and inducements.The movie is practically a compilation of great small character performances. Ed Harris, menacing with a shaved head, mainly requires little more than a couple of concise appearances to persuasively disclose the FBI's case against the Firm, and to divulge its airy readiness to force a potential witness to undergo impossible duress. Another potent performance is by David Strathairn, as the brother McDeere hasn't told the Firm about. Strathairn has arisen as one of the most commanding character actors around. There are also rich performances by Gary Busey, as an articulate private eye, and especially by Holly Hunter, as his allegiant secretary. Actually, watching this high falutin' legal thriller, it hit me that law firms have to some extent usurped Army platoons as Hollywood's most enjoyed universal human setting. The new law thrillers have the same components as those reliable old World War II action films: Assorted cultural and character archetypes who battle each other when they're not battling the enemy. The law movies have one formidable leg-up: the female characters engage equally in the fray, rather than simply cooking, cleaning and writing letters.The vast peanut gallery of characters makes The Firm into a persuasive Hollywood landscape. There are enough convincing people here to give McDeere a genuine environment to inhabit. And Pollack was forbearing inwith some ways with his material. He would allow a scene to go on until the point was made somewhat more acutely. That would let an actor like Hackman be stunningly compelling in scenes where he delicately authenticates that, in spite of everything, he has a decent soul. A sensitive scene near the climax between Hackman and Tripplehorn is like an advanced course in acting. The parts of The Firm seem better than the whole. And there are some great parts.",The Firm

Other Hollywood notables include Gary Busey, the Private Investagtor, Ed Harris the Federal Agent, David Strathairn, Mitch's imprisoned relative and Steven Hill, the attorney general. The movie is packed with character intrigue, dramatic excitement and most of all, a perfect collection of cinematic ingredients to entertain any audience. ****",The Firm

45,Lechuguilla,Trapped,7,13 May 2016,"A hotshot young lawyer named Mitch (Tom Cruise ... who else would Hollywood cast as a hotshot?) accepts a job with a small law firm in Memphis, only to become trapped in a nightmarish maze of deceit and corruption. The plot has Mitch a little slow to catch on, but when he does he draws upon inner cleverness he previously lacked to set a trap himself.The script has several problems, not the least of which is Mitch's naivete when accepting the job. He tells his wife Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn): ""These are nice people, Abby"". Turns out that Abby is more perceptive about these ""nice people"" than her high-income, hotshot hubby. The plot's first half is pretty good, with fine editing; the second half trends labyrinthine with tangled and convoluted plot elements that make the film hard to follow.Fast-paced, outdoor ""action"" towards the end is unrealistic and makes the film overly long. Most of the characters consist of annoying ""beautiful people"", hip, sophisticated, and rich; I was hoping most of them would die.Production values are terrific. Great on-location filming in Memphis is enhanced by polished outdoor photography. Interior sets look detailed and realistic. Nice, jazzy score if perhaps a bit loud. Casting is credible, though someone other than Tom Cruise might have brought more plausibility to the lead role. Performances overall add to a sense of professionalism. Hal Holbrook is always fun to watch. And I really liked Holly Hunter's performance as a two-bit smoking secretary with a heavy Southern drawl.Slick and sophisticated, ""The Firm"" was made during an era when audiences were still mesmerized with American wealth and corruption. It's a polished, perhaps too polished, production. Overall, the movie does have entertainment value despite an imperfect script.",The Firm

To sum this up, the performances were top grade, the direction was flawless, and the casting was perfect.

There were a few things that were very different and many parts played like one long action sequence. The book is a masterpiece and although the movie is certainly watchable it is a bit dull at times. The book existed on incredible tension, drama and great dialogue. It was simply riveting all the way through. The movie was less like a drama/psychological thriller and more, at times, like an (action movie?).There was nothing wrong with Cruise as Mc.Deere. He looks like what I'd picture Mitch to look like anyway from the book. But I am baffled as to why this was not left alone and done exactly as the book was. After all, the book was a major success-there's gotta be a reason. Gristham is such an amazing story teller that I don't know if this could have been successfully adapted to a movie but as movie thrillers go it wasn't at all dreadful but was just alright. But Just lacked a certain something and I gotta say it again, it would have been better to stick to the book (exactly). The changes they made in the movie didn't work.(won't give any spoilers.)

And Wilfred Brimley as the firm's PI was inspired. As for Gene Hackman, well, the man is above reproach. I humbly submit Hackman has more stellar roles on his resume than any actor living or dead.

OK, that's perhaps a little bit over the top, but I really thought that the movie would have been so much better without all the action. Does that mean the movie wasn't any good? No, it certainly had some good parts. I'm not going to tell which of course, that you'll have to find out for yourself. And Tom Cruise and Gene Hackman are fine actors of course, no doubt about that, but it was just too predictable and unbelievable.As a conclusion I would like to say that it certainly had potential and from time to time there was a lot of suspense, but they should have made it more believable.

Wilfred Brimley and Ed Harris each do sterling work.There's a clever script that's worth close attention, nice music and sound-tracks. All the technical issues such as camera-work, lighting and editing are themselves as slick as the lawyers they depict.

If he didn't get out of breath, I sure did whilst watching him.I'm surprised it has such a low rating.

If you're looking for something to cut, I'd start with him admitting to his infidelity. It's so boring and soap opera. There was more than enough intrigue in the story that they didn't need to heap this on. His wife working as the honey-pot was just stupid. Once again, there was enough going on in the story to include this bit of forced tension.The weakest link in the film was his wife.

59,frankde-jong,One of the best Grisham adaptations,7,14 November 2020,"The first half of the 90s were good years for Grisham adaptations. Within two years three films went into circulation: ""The firm"" (1993, Sydney Pollack), ""The pelican brief"" (1993, Alan J. Pakula) and ""The client"" (1994, Joel Schumacher). In most of these films either the beginning or the end convinces. In for example ""The pelican brief"" the beginning is hard to believe, but when you are ""into the story"" the film is really tense. In ""The firm"" on the other hand, it is the beginning that I found rather disturbing. The way the main character (lawyer Mitch McDeere played bt Tom Cruise) gets into trouble seems very plausible. In the end however the film goes sadly in the overdrive, with unnecessary action scenes. The middle part is somewhere in between.What is so good about the beginning of ""The firm""? In my opinion two things. In the first place it is very understandble that Harvard graduate and social climber Mitch McDeere, not used to luxury, succumbs to ""the offer you can't refuse"" that a law firm offers him and so joins a company which happens to engage in and facilitate shady deals. In the second place the impact of this on the relationship with his girlfriend Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn). Abby comes from a more wealthy family than Mitch and understands that there are no free lunches. Mitch interprets the fact that the employer arranges a house and interferes actively with the private life of their employees (they prefer that the wives do not have a job and stimulate children) as togetherness (the frm as one bg family). With Abby the alarm bells ring earlier. She interprets it not as togetherness but as as making the employee as dependent on the firm as possible.By the way director Pollack shows at a very early stage that the firm does not only arranges a house, but that this house is full of eavesdropping equipment. He thereby uses a technique of Hitchcock (let the viewer know more than the main characters).The middle part of the film (starting with the first encounter of Mitch and FBI detective Wayne Tarrance (Ed Harris)) is something weaker than the opening, but still rather good. It is only in the final part (starting with the cooperation of Mitch and Tammy Hemphill (Holy Hunter)) that the movie gives away to an overkill of action scenes.That ""The firm"" only slightly detoriorates after such a strong opening is due to a couple of strong supporting roles (beside the main characters Mitch and Abby). For example Hal Holbrook as one of the founders of the lawfirm, seeming a nice and trustworthy old man, being the lawyer of the mafia. Or Gene Hackman as Avery Tolar, the mentor of Mitch. He is a decent man suspecting too little too late, and now he is totally dependant on the firm.There are also a couple of strong scenes that boosts the average of especially the midlle part of the film. I think of the following scenes:
The first lunch of Mitch and Avery in which Avery tells Mitch that the firm is strict on alcohol during working hours, and directly after that orders a martini himself.
The first meeting of Mitch and FBI detective Tarrance in a restaurant. Mitch is studying for his bar exam, Tarrance is talking to a colleague on a nearby table. Tarrance makes (deliberately too loud) a few remarks about the law firm of Mitch, that sets his suspicion in motion.
The second meeting of Mitch and a young street artist. The first time Mitch has the energy to participate in the act. The second time Mitch listlessly passes by. He is well on his way to become a second Avery.",The Firm
60,seymourblack-1,Caught In A Trap,8,27 October 2015,"Anyone who has experienced poverty or hardship in their early life never forgets the experience and always retains a certain element of insecurity about wealth, regardless of how much financial success they later achieve. In ""The Firm"", it's this phenomenon that essentially drives a brilliant young law student to ignore numerous offers of career-enhancing opportunities from a number of prestigious big city law firms to, instead, join a small Memphis partnership who offer him a fantastic remuneration package. Unfortunately, what follows, perfectly illustrates the wisdom of the old adage that ""if something seems too good to be true, it probably is"".Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) is the Harvard Law School graduate from a poor background whose exceptional academic achievements lead to him being head-hunted by ""Berdini, Lambert & Locke"". The firm offer him a huge salary, a low-interest mortgage, a Mercedes and the repayment of his student loans and in return, Mitch readily agrees to join them. After relocating to Memphis with his wife Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn), he quickly settles into the practice and regularly works long hours. Initially, he's comfortable with the firm's family ethos and doesn't share Abby's unease about some of the advice she receives such as ""the firm encourages children"" etc. A little later, however, when he realises that a high percentage of the firm's work is related to the activities of the Mob and a couple of the firm's lawyers suddenly die in mysterious circumstances, he gets the strong feeling that something sinister is going on.Mitch's suspicions are confirmed when he gets approached by the director of the FBI and Agent Wayne Tarrance (Ed Harris) who inform him about the firm's criminal and money-laundering activities. They want Mitch to supply them with information and documents to be used as evidence to bring his employers to justice and add that if he doesn't co-operate, things will be made very difficult for his brother who's in jail facing a manslaughter charge. They also emphasise that Mitch effectively doesn't have any choice in the matter because no partner has ever left the firm alive and if he simply decides to stay with the firm, he could face 20 years in prison when they go down, as they inevitably will.Mitch knows it would be impossible to pass on the documents that the FBI want without breaching the confidence of his legitimate clients and taking that action would inevitably lead to the loss of his licence to practice law. He therefore realises that in order to meet their demands without losing his career, making his brother's parlous situation worse or winding up dead at the hands of his ruthless employers (or the Mob), he needs to devise an imaginative plan to get out of the trap he's in. When he then discovers that the firm have routinely been over-billing clients for some considerable time, he starts to see an opportunity to formulate just such a plan but, of course, its success is by no means guaranteed.Based on John Grisham's bestselling novel, this glossy thriller was understandably a huge box-office success. It's intriguing, tense and highly entertaining and features a whole collection of great performances from its star-studded cast. Surprisingly though, it's Gary Busey, Gene Hackman, Ed Harris and Holly Hunter that really bring the screen to life in their relatively small parts while Tom Cruise and Jeanne Tripplehorn also do well in their starring roles.",The Firm
61,classicalsteve,One of the Best Adaptions of Grisham and Great Performances Ensemble Cast,9,7 September 2021,"I've always felt that ensemble casts were the best, rather than single-star movies. Apparently, Cruise insisted only his name be at the top of the movie poster, which is unfortunate because the film works not only because of him but the rest of a stellar cast working with a fine screenplay. Along with Cruise, just about every other actor in the cast contributes to this film's success, particularly Jeanne Tripplehorn (who has just about as much screen time as Cruise), Gene Hackman, Holly Hunter, and Wilford Brimley, who plays against type as a ruthless ""Mr. Fix-it"" for the firm. Hunter was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Honorable mention also goes to Ed Harris, David Strathairn, and Hal Holbrook.Mitch McDeere is a stellar law student graduating from Harvard. He's being recruited by all the top law firms in the US, focusing on tax and property law. One law firm out of Memphis, TN, Bendini, Lambert & Locke, makes it clear they want him badly, and make him the biggest offer than any other firm (respective of geographic location). In other words, a $100,000/year salary in Memphis is worth about $175,000 in New York.He and his wife Abby visit Memphis and the law firm, and find out a few strange things. Abby picks up on them but Mitch is rather oblivious. They hang out with another young couple whose husband has also just joined the firm. A couple of little items are mentioned by the other wife, that the firm encourages children and are not against a wife of an associate working. Huh? Since when does a law firm get to approve or disapprove of an associate's family situation? Mitch only sees the good and dismisses the red flags but Abby is concerned.Despite the red flags, Mitch takes the offer, and the couple move into a nice house furnished by the firm who also puts in their telephones. They're told that the firm does all the telephone installations. Pretty quickly we learn the firm is bugging the McDeeres' household. Then two law firm associates were killed in some kind of a boating accident. Mitch and Abby meet with the young couple they had met during their exploratory visit. Both are distraught with grief.Mitch is then paired with Avery Tolar (Gene Hackman), his assigned mentor to help with the bar exam. Mitch then learns no one at the firm ever failed the bar exam. Avery takes Mitch to the Cayman Islands to meet with one of their clients, who appears to be a bit sleazy. Who are the firm's clients? At night on the beach at the Cayman's, Mitch makes a behavioral decision which will deepen his commitment to the firm, but on their terms, not his. But that takes on more of an implication when he learns other law firm associates died under mysterious conditions which is confirmed by two FBI guys at a cafe, who inform him that no associate has ever left Bendini, Lambert & Locke alive.The crucial scene comes when Mitch is given a message at a tax law conference in Washington DC to take a bus to a park. There he meets the agent he met in the cafe and another head agent. He is told his life as he knows it is over. Or is it? The FBI agents want him to steal files from the firm, which include illegal activity of their clients. Unfortunately, if Mitch engages in this behavior, he could jeopardize his future to practice law as this could violate the attorney-client privilege which states that a lawyer cannot reveal incriminating information about his or her client.The whole point of the film is about how Mitch McDeere must straddle the pressure of the US government, his commitment as an attorney, and his life and relationship with his wife. A thoroughly compelling film from beginning to end. The finale of the film is quite a bit different than the novel, but I somewhat preferred the ending of the film to that of the book. Great performances by the whole cast. Cruise and Tripplehorn have great onscreen chemistry. Strathairn is also compelling as Mitch's brother to whom he reconnects. And Gene Hackman is compelling as the rogue associate at the firm who is allowed to mess around.",The Firm

Not a good thing.  The music too is on the same quality level.  In short, there are few positive aspects as a film alone that I can recommend.Cruise, Tripplehorn, Hackman, Holbrock, Harris, Hunter, and Busey in particular cannot be described as anything other than typical blockbuster prop-ups.  Everything is exactly what it seems.  I will give credit to the firm security chiefs for speaking in the two tongues rather effectively.  I think the locations chosen throughout the film add to the atmosphere, even if the scenes themselves are predictable.It's interesting to study the relationship between Pollack and the Steinkamps, his editors for this movie.  He's trusted them with so many other films, but those were better than this.  Notice how they understand Pollack better than he understands the script in most cases.

I think it's high time that the National Association for the Advancement of Albino Assassins protests Hollywood's blatant stereotyping.* David Strathairn. Any movie with DS in it is worth watching.

He's still good looking, of course, but when this film was made he was at his peak.It's fashionable to mock Cruise these days, but he deserves credit. He was almost eerie good looking when he was younger, and yet, unlike, say, a Matthew Mcconaughey or Brad Pitt who let their prettiness just sit up there on screen without doing much with it, Cruise had the drive of a Jimmy Cagney or other actors who had to get past their lack of prettiness. Cruise's drive is something to watch. * Jeanne Tripplehorn is so pretty but so boring to watch. And she and Cruise have zero chemistry. * There's an amazing scene where an older Gene Hackman attempts to seduce younger, prettier JT. Hackman's so poignant in this part, and the part was so well written, that you wish that that storyline had had its own movie. * And, the Elvis imitator/catfish truck driver was kind of interesting ...And no movie with Ed Harris in it is a complete waste of time.",The Firm

It was actually enjoyable. The run time didn't feel too long, and Tom Cruise was fantastic. Especially with the action scenes.

67,barryrd,"""The Firm"" is a flop",4,28 August 2016,"The Firm is a major disappointment, lacking the drama and characters that are such a strong part of the book. From the start, we get little appreciation of the characters, particularly Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise), the Harvard trained lawyer from the wrong side of the tracks who hopes to live his version of the American Dream. He joins a law firm in Memphis with an offer that is quite literally too good to be true. When he realizes he is in a nest of vipers, he finds himself in a no win situation between the law firm and the FBI, which has been trying to bring the firm to justice. The soft jazzy music throughout this ""thriller"" is an constant irritant that only lengthens the boredom of this tiresome piece of film-making. I was misled by the page turner of a book by John Grisham that gave readers so much entertainment back in the early 1990's. Tom Cruise is too much the movie celebrity to fit the role of Mitch McDeere. Gene Hackman has a key role as his mentor but doesn't fit the bill either. To me he is always Popeye Doyle from the French Connection movies. I did find Wilford Brimley and Ed Harris, on opposite sides of the organized crime machine vs. the law, to be the most convincing, although their performances were lost in this forgettable movie. By all means, read the book but take a pass on the movie.",The Firm

69,khatcher-2,"Despite being pop-corn Hollywood veneered, a very acceptable drama",6,3 November 2002,"Tom Cruise had the problem of trying not to be just the pretty boy of Hollywood, and on the whole his dramatic performances thus far clearly indicate he is a talented actor. Matt Damon, for example, has not succeeded even remotely in convincing anybody of anything. However, Cruise has calibre: ever since `The Color of the Money' (1986) with Paul Newman, the first film I can remember seeing him in, he has turned in some excellent dramatic interpretations. Among his most memorable rôles I must mention as well as The Color of Money, Rain Man (1988) as Charlie Babbitt, Born on the Fourth of July (1989) in a very powerful performance as Ron Kovic, A Few Good Men, (1992) also in an inspired rôle as Lieutenant Daniel Alistair Kaffee, The Firm, (1993) as Mitch McDeere, Magnolia (1999)(qv) as Frank T.J. Mackey, and I might just tag on his rather overcooked interpretation in Jerry Maguire (1996). And it does not look as if this actor is anywhere near running out of steam; I'm not surprised: Penelope Cruz would inspire anyone to do great things! (I have not yet seen `Vanilla Sky').In this case it is a rather naturally gorgeous Jeanne Tripplehorn who helped out in tending the loving hand of wife for Cruise in this well-paced legal thriller, indeed, one of the best of its kind. Perhaps after over two hours my concentration was going down, as I tended to lose track of where everybody was, scene shifts from Memphis to Boston to Chicago to Cayman Islands to New York (have I missed out anywhere?) and back to Memphis, punctuated by a quasi-Yul Brynner looking FBI type and Holly Hunter in all sorts of predicaments. But there is no doubting the integrity and coherence of this film as it exposes certain underhand or just illegal operations carried out by a prestigious law company. Well, we already know that in those opulent walnut-lined offices all kinds of not very transparent goings-on are going on.. whether you be in London, Berlin, Sydney, Seattle or Dallas: they would only be wallpapered otherwise.Despite being just over 150 minutes long, this film is worth your while, for the interpretative performances as well as the story-line, very correctly directed by Sydney Pollack, and with Dave Grushin supplying some interesting music played by himself.I go along with 6.6 on the voting scale",The Firm
70,cardsrock,Decent lawyer thriller,7,26 July 2020,"Tom Cruise is as competent as ever in this Sydney Pollack-directed law film. I would put his film Three Days of the Condor ahead of this one though because the Firm lacks much of the excitement and well-plotted story beats. There are a few moments of suspense, but a lot of is it pretty slow-moving. The cast is fantastic though with several standout performances. The score, while good, felt very out of place in several scenes. This was also probably at least half an hour too long. The Firm is a slightly above average thriller from the 90s that provides a good starring role for Tom Cruise.",The Firm
71,caa821,Enjoyed equally with book - liked ending in movie better,10,16 December 2006,"Since 1998, I've enjoyed seeing this film for more than just the story and performance.About five years following its 1993 release - my family and I spent a week and a half at Westin's 5* Casuarina resort on Grand Caymen. It is across the main beach road, not far from the Hyatt facility featured in the film - every bit as nice, but immediately on the beach, and on the best stretch of one of the finest beaches anywhere.We danced at the large Holiday Inn resort (now supplanted by an new facility), where Gene Hackman was doing the same when he and Cruise visited the island initially. We walked the beach at night, in what in the film appeared to be the same part where Cruise was filmed with the beautiful young island girl.I've read elsewhere, and in this site, that both Cruise and Tripplehorn's parts were preciously offered to other actors - and I feel the story is better for these others (unwisely, career-wise) ""passing.""Every single other actor in the picture is well-cast - and this is one of those films where, for me, both the story and the way the director chose to present it - as well as the performances by all concerned, merged perfectly.If you haven't read the book, please do so.

Oddly, I thought the bed scene of Jeanne Tripplehorn and Gene Hackman emitted more eroticism than Tripplehorn and Cruise. Paul Sorvino and Joe Viterelli are extremely miscast.

74,dead47548,A great legal thriller.,8,22 July 2008,"I've always loved political/legal thrillers, especially ones that deal with a man in a corrupt organization who is trying to work his way out and beat them. The Firm is definitely one of the better films of this nature that I've seen. Tom Cruise is definitely the right man to lead the story along, making it compelling the entire way through and keeping the viewer on his side. Most of the cast is quite good, but I want to highlight Ed Harris who steals every one of his scenes. He was perfect for the part and added an intensity that really impressed me, especially in the scene at the dog track. Holly Hunter (who received an Oscar nomination) should also be mentioned for a role completely unlike her work in The Piano, which she won the Oscar for in the same year. It's a cute, bubbly secretary character that feels like it came right out of some classic noir. The Firm is a crisply written, very suspenseful, well acted and well executed thriller. I'd also like to mention the excellent, Oscar-nominated score, which felt like something out of a more vintage era of thrillers. It was very reminiscent of Three Days of the Condor's, another thriller from Pollack that featured a man on the run from several organizations trying to figure out what's going on. My only complaints are that it feels a little bit too long and it gets pretty convoluted about halfway through. I'd say around when Mitch (Cruise's character) discovers the over-billing thing is when there starts to be a bit too much going on and it gets a little hard to understand everything in the moment. But it's never too over the top.",The Firm
75,tastyhotdogs,Could have been way better if they invested wisely,6,24 August 2007,"I'm gonna do this review a little different and pick on 3 major flaws of this movie. Had they fixed these, this could have been a classic.1/ Casting The casting for this movie was awful. Tom Cruise was good as the lead and Gene Hackman, Gary Busey and Holly Hunter were solid, but nearly every other actor was terribly cast. Most notable was Jeanne Tripplehorn as Abby and David Strathairn as Ray. The reason for this bad casting- David Rubin. Check out his resume of terrible movies...Random Hearts Men In Black Albino Alligator Waterworld Addams Family ValuesShame because the chemistry between Tom and Jeanne was vital to the movie, and they had the chemistry of Rob and Sandra from the 10 Late News. Also more marks taken off for the lazy casting of Paul Sorvino and Joe Viterelli as mafia guys. They sure are typecast. I'd love to see either of them as lead guys in a romantic comedy or sci-fi thriller.2/ The Score The music for key scenes was awful. Blame Dave Grusin for this. His resume includes ""The Goonies"" and ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"". How did they pick him? Was one of the producers watching ""The Goonies"" on video one night and thinking ""the guy doing this score is brilliant, but I reckon he'd be better suited to the law genre""?3/ The extra Great scene after Tom gets off a public phone about 3/4 of the way through the movie where he walks away and an extra walks across camera smirking. One of the best I've seen, the best being the guy in ""Cliffhanger"" who laughs almost off camera when a lady falls to her death.That's enough whinging. Let's get to the movie review.""The Firm"" is about a brilliant prospective lawyer who decides to join a lesser known firm in Memphis who has headhunted him desperately. The lawyer, Mitch McDeere (Cruise, in his best work since ""Days of Thunder""), can't believe his luck and after some wining and dining is sold. His partner, Abby (terribly cast once again as Jeanne Tripplehorn, and it's not anything to do with her because I loved her in ""The Fugitive"", although all she did was get brutally murdered and then utter the famous line ""Richard....Richard...he's trying to kill me""), becomes suspicious about ""the firm"" and soon her fears mount when two lawyers mysteriously die. Turns out the firm is involved with the mafia and has some secrets to hide. Mitch is soon threatened and must decide whether to keep quiet or risk everything, even his life, to expose them. Guess which road he takes?Was alright, some good moments, but could have been way better if I cast it and chose the music.",The Firm
76,kgprophet,Dated Movie still Thrills in the 3rd Act.,5,25 July 2020,"I saw this film in the theater when it first came out. I like good thrillers. I don't get terribly excited about legal thrillers, but if it's well made I will become invested in it. The angle this film takes is of the yuppy dream, to land a cushy job by strategically constructing your professional brownie points. Here, Tom Cruise finishes first in his class at Harvard. With newlywed wife in tow, it's off to the suburbs and the shopping malls with Cruise's new legal job. This is the early 1990s, the fluffy hair and dresses with shoulder pads still were fashion. It dates the film, but even back then I felt like this film was not rising above the material. The set design was generic suburban showroom. Worse, the lighting looked like a TV movie.And, oh god, the soundtrack. Even though the production hired one of the greatest pianists around, it still sounds like music for a high school play. A single piano playing pretty much standards sounds cheap and uninspired. I'm sure the director Sydney Pollack is a big fan of this kind of music, but for a prominent Hollywood movie, it's like fingernails on a chalkboard.I could tell the director tried to keep the dialogue realistic, and in the process shows the need to have the main character's background include flaws, like motivation to get rich coming from a poor family. So even though from page 10 when we know that the legal firm that Cruise has joined launders money for the mafia, we have to sit through the entire first act and halfway into the second act as we watch Cruise do his jaw-drop reactions for the first hour and a half. Cruise finally makes a decision about this and eventually propels us into a more satisfactory third act.Perhaps at least the audience can bide their time during this lightweight production by counting all the name actors parading in front of the camera. Jean Tripplehorn, Hal Holbrook, Wilford Brimley, Holly Hunter, Gene Hackman, Gary Busey!, Ed Harris, David Strathairn, and other well known character actors like Paul Sorvino and Joe Viterelli. Tripplehorn suffers the most, stuck to being the housewife (despite the smart dialogue about having a job). She stays at home and is forced to go through the humiliation of being cheated on. Although she plays a small role in the resolution, it is incredibly contrived and totally unbelievable.Once Cruise starts to figure out his escape from the Firm's clutches, the movie picks up momentum and gives the audience some twists and some good tension. Even the piano score morphs into Lalo Schifrin ""Mission Impossible"", with backing percussion. Where was this percussion before? Cruise as usual is charismatic in his role and the script allows his character to outsmart his overlords. When his escape plan materializes, I found myself cheering for our protagonist. The story, from the novel by John Grisham, neatly ties up all loose ends and almost makes you forgive the awful beginning of this film. Partial credit goes to renown script fixer Robert Towne.When I rewatched this film recently, I had the same reaction when I originally saw it in the theater. If you are a legal buff, you might like some of the reality based legal jargon. Tom Cruise, who always plays Tom Cruise, is likable in this film. However, all the supporting characters don't live up to their potential, except perhaps the few seconds David Strathairn appears as Cruise's down-on-his-luck brother. If you aren't into legal thrillers and can't stand Tom Cruise, then you can skip this one.5 out of 10.",The Firm
77,thebricks,"Propaganda, an ad for law schools",1,25 August 2019,"I was about 10 or 11 when this movie came out in the nineties. The first ten minutes were just some cringe-worthy stuff. A law student that was the son of a coal miner is being fought over by law schools all over the country. What, he accepts a job with a law firm in Memphis instead of LA or NYC? Yeah right!I used to fall for these movies before I grew up and realized the only people who get recruited like this are usually rich, went to boarding schools and connected to several rich people. It's a lie that college students are all broke, especially the ones that go to law school.This book is based on the sort of trash they used to write specifically for well-off corporate business travelers to stroke their ego. Not even worth watching.",The Firm
78,mnpollio,Painful adaptation of Grisham's page-turner,1,19 April 2011,"John Grisham fairly burst on the scene with the very definition of a page-turner in the legal thriller The Firm. His novel is slick, manipulative, undeniably fast-paced and suspenseful. Keep those last two terms in mind, because fast-paced and suspenseful can never be ascribed to the stillborn, ponderous mess that Sydney Pollack perpetrates on the viewer.The storyline centers on idealistic young attorney Tom Cruise, who joins a prestigious Southern law firm that ends up having ties to organized crime and begins to take control of his life. The novel details the dawning realization and horror that the attorney and his wife face when it is discovered that they are basically owned by The Firm and their lives are in danger should they ever step out of line. The film details pretty much the same story with some rather wrong-headed derivations and devoid of any tensions or excitement.The cast is par excellence. There is not even a minor role not inhabited by a first-rate actor. Cruise is ideally cast as the attorney. Gene Hackman is reliable as his mentor at the firm. Unfortunately, of the remaining cast, only Holly Hunter makes much of an impression as a canny private detective's secretary who ends up helping the lead couple. Jeanne Tripplehorn spends much of the film looking constipated as Cruise's wife. The film offers her a mid-way revelation that results in her spending an obscene amount of time moping on a set of swings. The various shady characters at the firm that instilled such fear and distrust in the novel are inhabited on screen by a diversity of non-threatening, retirement age actors - like Hal Holbrook. And to play the terrifying head of security and enforcer of the firm - the man that no one wants to mess with - Pollack casts Wilford Brimley - the avuncular grandfather figure from the oat bran commercials. Apparently Pollack was going for irony, but it blows up in his face. There is something to be said when Ed Harris' relatively sympathetic FBI agent comes off as more of a threat than the assassins dogging Cruise. With the likes of Holbrook and Brimley out to get him, Cruise just has to rev up to a hearty shuffle in order to avoid them.The pace is the film's worst problem. It is stagnant from start to finish. There is literally no stretch of excitement in the entire film based on a novel that was swimming in it. Part of the issue is that Pollack seems to think the story is of biblical importance and needs to be portrayed with unflagging solemnity - in short, he is too good to stoop to a thrill. The film is tragically overlong and easily feels like triple the length it is. Anything that was remotely exciting from the novel has been removed or depicted in such a painfully tedious fashion lest one break a sweat.Even worse, changes made in the story and the outcome in particular make no sense. The true evil of the firm was actually the organized crime syndicate that it fronted for. In the film, the organized crime syndicate is depicted as almost a neutral figure that can be won over by Cruise's reasoning and savvy, while the firm itself it depicted as the ultimate evil (HUH?). We never truly feel that Cruise and Tripplehorn are ever in any serious danger and that, coupled with the staggering pace and running time, gives us no rooting interest in the outcome. And when the outcome is as weak as it is here, one is just as happy not to wait around for it.The score sounds like low-rent jazz and often detracts even further from the ""action"".This production is a veritable textbook on how not to adapt a popular page-turner. A lumbering, tortuous, joyless mess devoid of tension, suspense, excitement or any recognizable human emotion. Even the most undiscerning viewers will find themselves looking at their watches and tapping their feet prior to the halfway mark. A complete misfire and a total dud - this film is indeed painful.",The Firm

82,HelloTexas11,good but unsettling,6,13 November 2007,"One doesn't usually think of legal dramas as being fast-paced; consider films such as 'The Verdict' or 'Presumed Innocent.' They almost always proceed slowly and deliberately, weaving the various plot threads into an intricate pattern that is only unraveled at the very end. 'The Firm', though, moves at a lightning pace. We are not even through the opening credits before we know more than most films of this type reveal in the first hour. Cruise's character, fresh out of Harvard, goes to work for a tightly-knit, closed-mouth law firm in Memphis; he is provided with a new house, a new car, a big salary; his wife is immediately suspicious of how controlling the law firm appears to be; and there is every indication the people running the firm are corrupt. This, as I say, is revealed before we even get to the director's credit. What follows is a very entertaining legal thriller with the requisite labyrinth plot, twists and turns, and surprise (if a bit confused) ending. I will let someone else comment at length on the preceding. Here's what I meant by the title, 'good but unsettling'- it seems to me that, at its heart, what 'The Firm' is really about is how people will sell their souls for perks. That idea runs throughout the film, sometimes just below the surface, other times driven home with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. The home, the car, the big paycheck, a plush office, trips to the Caribbean- they're all yours (or Tom Cruise's) if you just sign away your individuality, your identity, your soul. Your only loyalty is to The Firm. It comes first. In fact, there's nothing that even comes second, not your wife or family, certainly not your freedom. And to ensure that loyalty, you are spied upon, your house is bugged, you are followed when you go to lunch, you are liable to be photographed in any situation. The unsettling part for me is not just how this is presented on film (though it is undeniably creepy), it's how easily people watching this can be sucked in at first, just like Cruise's character is. Many will see the first few minutes and be very envious of the riches suddenly bestowed on him; many will feel they are watching something like a person winning the lottery and wish they were in that situation. The movie does get around to asking the question, how important is it to be rich? When is the price in return too high to pay? I suspect you could devise an interesting psychological test by asking people at what point in this movie they would say, ""No, it wouldn't be worth that.""",The Firm
83,NewEnglandPat,A great cast in a tense thriller,8,5 September 2005,Film is a tense thriller about a lawyer who joins a mysterious law firm which turns out to be quite a different enterprise. Tom Cruise and Gene Hackman head a fine cast that brings John Grisham's best-seller to life as partners who try to leave the firm find themselves and their families in grave danger. The firm has unsavory connection with organized crime which has a talent for weeding out malcontents and discouraging defections. Another troubling aspect about the firm is the strain it brings on Cruise's marriage as he discovers how desperate his situation has become.

Picture has great color and a nice music score.,The Firm
84,arthurclay,A great suspense thriller,10,2 January 2005,"This movie was the movie that finally drove the fact home to me that Tom Cruise was a good actor and pushed him to the front of the line. The casting was really really great and the plot was first rate. Cruise is a fresh out of college law student named Mitch with a pretty new wife who is dreaming of becoming a successful and big name lawyer. So as any other graduate he is sending out resumes and getting offers from different firms. But one firm from Memphis, Tennessee gives him an offer he can't refuse. It seems like a small homegrown firm that is very wealthy and prosperous and prides itself on being the best. But this isn't any ordinary law firm. It's a ""Family"" with a history of partners having premature deaths and now Mitch is part of it. And he can't get out. Not alive anyways. So Mitch has to find a way out without joining the list of expired former associates. Gene Hackman in this is incredibly, stunningly, unbelievably great. His character quickly becomes Cruise's mentor. He is an unhappy, alcoholic, womanizing ambulance chaser (albeit an highly powerful and prosperous one) who also cannot escape either and is the linchpin in the unfolding drama that Cruise and Tripplehorn find themselves square in the middle of. Hackman is the one you should despise and dislike right from the beginning but you can't even if you try very hard because he is a likable person and you know he is in serious trouble which makes you emphasize with him right from the get go. My favorite Grisham book adaptation it made him a household name to this very day. Also features appearances by Paul Sorvino, Gary Busey, and Holly Hunter.",The Firm
85,patryk-czekaj,A law thriller that will please everyone,7,7 May 2012,"I always assumed that no movie based on John Grisham's books can be boring. Why? Because all of them include the most gripping and thrilling stories ever. And it can't be denied that one of their most amazing aspects is that they are perfectly fitted to be adapted onto the big screen. I wanted to watch this film since the time that I have finished reading The Firm, this amazing book, which turned Grisham into a world class writer. I craved for more of its pure excellence. I just needed to see Sydney Pollack's vision. And I am so happy to say right now that he certainly didn't let me down.Tom Cruise, still in his early days of glory, is an ideal Mitch McDeere, the young, ambitious and somehow innocent young lawyer. The man just passed the bar exam and started looking for a job. And then he found what he thought was a perfect opportunity for a well-paid job of his dreams. Unfortunately, this all seemed a bit too good to be totally legit and risk-free. But, at the time, who could tell that this particular firm is controlled by a group of dangerous Mafia thugs?This is the moment when the fun starts. The fast-paced sequences begin to roll. The viewer starts to uncover one secret after another of the overly corrupted Bendini, Lambert & Locke law firm. The suspense is heightening with every scene and that is what makes you concentrated all the time. You simply don't want to miss any part of the action. And I can assure everybody, it won't stop until the last minute. This is what makes the movie so similar to the book - you just can't stop till you know the whole story all the way through. Of course they had to do some rewrites and cut out some of the scenes and subplots (even though the movie is still relatively long). This is probably why the movie seems a bit chaotic at times. Also, I didn't like what the did with the ending, it should have stayed as it was described in the book.On another topic, I love the way that all of the great supporting characters build up the plot. And the stars that play them. One of the most memorable cameos of this movie must be the one made by Gary Busey. The only person that really didn't convince me was Jeanne Tripplehorn. I pictured Mitch's wife very differently - let's just say she seemed more beautiful and appealing in my mind. However, that still didn't stop Gene Hackman's character as he tried to seduce her in the most adorable way (one of the best scenes in my opinion).Even though I found the book more exciting than the movie, I still highly recommend it for its ever-occurring suspense and the atmosphere that causes shivers on the back. You won't find many law thrillers like this one for sure - except maybe for other Grisham masterpieces.8/10",The Firm

91,chrstphrtully,"Convoluted, but Ultimately Worthwhile Thriller",7,8 October 2007,"By now, the specifics of the plot of ""The Firm"" are well-known. Consequently, any plot description would be ultimately useless. Nonetheless, John Grisham's plot has been given worthy treatment by its screenwriters (David Rabe, Robert Towne, and David Rayfiel), its director (Sydney Pollack), and, especially its actors.Many of the plot holes in Grisham's novel have been deftly handled by the scriptwriters, though fortuity still plays a far greater role than it should. All the same, Pollack's stylish direction, and particularly astute performances by Cruise, Tripplehorn, Hunter, Busey and -- in what should have been an Oscar-nominated performance -- Hackman, rescue the film. Hackman's performance in particular is an anchor -- an example of what Cruise's character could have become. Two particularly profound moments demonstrate why Hackman is one of the two or three greatest actors of the latter half of the twentieth century -- first, the moment outside the schoolyard with Tripplehorn, in which he is laid almost completely, emotionally bare; the second (also with Tripplehorn), in the Caribbean co-op, where his line-delivery is practically a primer in restrained, but effective, acting.As noted above, the performances of Cruise, Tripplehorn, Hunter and Busey are also noteworthy, as is the score of Dave Grusin, which keeps a percussive (and suspenseful) thread beneath the entire proceedings. In short, this is a film I expected to hate (because of the initial, contrived hype of the book's plot), but was converted by the fine direction, scripting, and performances.",The Firm

101,wpirotte,for the totally ignorant viewer,5,18 July 2020,"Admittedly the general production and acting were very good. The idea that you could bring down a law firm without getting killed by its mafia clientele is kind of clever, even if silly. However, the premise of the solution, submerged, as it should have been, until the very end of the move (yeah, there were some earlier hints, but no one would believe them)...is ludicrous. Attorneys constantly overbill their clients, and, ironically, are usually breaking their ""bar exam"" oath, as well as local ethics rules. The only clear way to sue/charge for the concommitant mail fraud would be to find a judge to interpret the mailed overbilling as possible mail fraud (an enormous order), and then to convict, with or without a jury. Since, without exception, ALL JUDGES ARE ATTORNEYS, this is close to impossible. Assuming (insanely) you found one judge to do it, the various judges upward in the appeal process would not allow the case to go forward. Modern judges will not even honor the most rudimentary aspects of the Constitution, as a rule, and are utterly devoid of any sense of fairness or common sense. Heck, they are attorneys! Everyone knows that attorneys are the lowest form of life on earth. If John Grisham actually wrote this nonsense, or if it was the suspiciously large number of screenwriters working with Pollack, I dunno. I certainly won't buy the book to find out, after waiting a prodigious amount of time on the movie. The only time judges take a radical, precedent-busting position on any law, is to hurt the Nation at large, a la Tulsa, to free actual criminals, or to kill babies.",The Firm

Law meets the Godfather"" so is the film.  I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan, he almost always plays the hot-shot (fill-in-the-blank) who's the best at what he does, but I must reluctantly agree that the man can act.  Here, he is supported by an amazing cast including a very understated Gene Hackman, the under-rated Ed Harris and the under-utilized Gary Busey.Even at over 2 1/2 hours, it is missing much from the book and the ending was completely rewritten as the chase through the Florida keys in the novel would have required a 2 hour movie all by itself.  Despite that, the plot twists and turn keep you watching and the large ensemble cast hit all the right notes (it was worth the $7 in the theater just to hear Wilford Brimley use the f-word).I own this and have watched it several times.

But the whole premise of this movie is just unrealistic if you think about. McDeere joins a law firm, unknowing that the firm represents the mob. Along comes the Feds, wanting McDeere to testify against the law firm, or else! This is not how it works in the United States. Everyone is entitled to legal representation, even the mafia and the mob. The Feds don't go after the lawyers like this. They can't, because the lawyers are bound by the attorney /client secrets privilege clause. The Feds cannot coerce a lawyer to share client secrets with them. It would be unethical in our judicial system, and if it ever made it to court, the charges would get thrown out. But still, besides this error, it's a great movie.

109,dragonshield,A decent thriller which has its problems,6,29 April 2007,"Mitch McDeere, played by Tom Cruise, is a young lawyer who is hired for law firm, where his salary is pretty much the dream of all lawyers. The firm pays his new house, his new car and basically everything, but then Mitch finds out that the firm isn't what he thought it was.... That is the plot outline, a good plot outline for a thriller. As a thriller, this movie manages itself pretty well, it's decent. The story has some twists in it, which keeps you interested pretty much throughout the movie. The screenplay's good enough, but the movie itself isn't a masterpiece, hence to what I said earlier: Decent.We all know Tom Cruise is a wacko these days, but I don't mind, as he is one of my favourite actors and can pretty much perform any role pretty flawlessly. He has this certain charisma which many actors don't have and that makes him unique in a way. In this movie I am happy to say that his role performance is probably the best thing this movie has to offer. It's nothing mind breaking, but it's still a good role performance. He is very believable in the young lawyer's role and his showing of emotions is once again excellent. That's what makes him one of my favourite actors, he's just so believable when it comes to emotions in a role. When he has to cry and shed a few tears he always does it in a so realistic way that it's always a real pleasure for your eyes. Not forgetting Mr. Gene Hackman, who is pretty much always an eye pleaser. Though the role performances aren't so significant in this movie, both Cruise and Hackman do their job like it's supposed to do. Nice.Probably one of the best things besides already mentioned Cruise's performance is the rhythm of the movie. It starts off slow, building up minute by minute and the tempo just raises all the time right till the end. It's pretty genius and for a thriller that's what is needed to make it work. The end solution is pretty intelligent as well, I myself didn't see it coming. Like I said earlier, there's twists in the plot for everyone to have a decent movie experience. I also have to mention the music, as it's also one of the best things in this movie. It's this piano music which keeps on going, raising and then going down, nothing beautiful or mind breaking, but it fits to the movie like candy for a child. Great.The movie isn't perfect, but it's not bad at all. I don't love it and I don't hate it, it's just some of those movies you can watch late at night by just sitting in front of the TV eating a sandwich and drinking your beer, you get that decent movie experience, you'll just be pleased enough. However, that is all you pretty much get. I could watch it again, so it's not boring or anything, but however I have to admit that it does have this certain dullness in it. If you're looking for a thriller nothing so serious and above the average, then this is what you're looking for.",The Firm

It's too long for the theme, Cruiser's character looks to young for the part, compared to his role in Rob Reiner's ""A Few Good Men"", almost contemporary...Is it Pollack's fault?. In a way, yes. Pollack's characters must be ""deep"", to sustain the length of his movies. Just watch again ""Out of Africa"", it's almost a miracle. The characters are deep, the script is so real, the emotions so overwhelming, the truth so historical..Maybe the fault is just Grisham's Novel.

Trying to impress his wife after a street-tumbling routine falls flat, McDeere takes a job with a high-powered Memphis law firm.From day one the partners pile on the PSI, stacking book after book of bar exam prep until McDeere can barely see over the tower. In a pivotal scene, the partners call Mitch into the biggest room in the building to inform him of his epic testing failure. Instead of hearing the truth, MM suffers a psychotic delusion wherein he actually believes he got a top score on the exam.Wasting away in a mental hospital, the delusions pile higher than the study books for the tragic McDeere as he envisions ridiculously escalating storylines that include a Red-Stripe-fueled beach romp, an imaginary convict brother, the director of the FBI, the dad from Shallow Hal, and most improbably a Wilford Brimley wiretap.Though we never learn whether Mitch comes out of his fugue state, the price of admission is worth more than the going rate (at the time) for a fried egg sandwich.8/10",The Firm

I had seen this movie a million times before today, but just now bought it on DVD. The theatrical trailer 1 is very good and doesn't even show that much of the movie. My favorite parts of this movie was mainly the ending sequences which I won't go into because you need to see them for yourself.

Only a face like Cruise's could convince us that a lawyer could swim through an ocean of excrement and come out smelling of roses. In support of his integrity is the relationship he has with his wife, the doe-eyed Jeanne Tripplehorn, where honesty triumphs over mollification. Cruise and David Strathairn, unwittingly I think, manage to reproduce the recovering affection of the fraternal relationship seen in 'Rain Man'. The appeal of this movie, which incessantly brings us throughout all the delightful intricacies of a John Grisham novel, is that McDeere (Cruise) is not only likable but credible.

The F.B.I. surveys this  strange  firm: The police knows how they do without any proof: they work with the Maffia to ""wash"" the money in the Caiman's Islands in order not to pay any taxes.

134,SampanMassacre,Cookie-Cutter Cruise Canon (turn off your brain and enjoy),6,24 December 2009,"Tom Cruise is the best fighter pilot. Tom Cruise is the best bartender. So why not be the best lawyer (actually, one person got a higher score on the bar exam, but he probably cheated). This film, directed by Sydney Pollock and based on yet another dolphin-lawyer-swimming- in-shark-filled-water book by John Grisham, is stylistic, classy, and perfectly vapid. Cruise, straight out of Harvard (yet he had to work hard to make it through, and, like all of Cruise's characters, has a troubled past he must make up for), gets a lucrative job at a firm that not only caters to the mob, but is part of their own crime syndicate. After he and wife Jeanne Tripplehorn (in an effective performance aimed at opening night audiences) are given a new house, a new car, and a great new paycheck, Cruise, after realizing the firm's corruptness, slowly figures out a loophole to beat them at their own game. What he does to strike back is confusing and would probably take a lawyer to understand (or someone who read the book), but it doesn't matter. Fun is fun, and this movie, if taken too seriously, could be thoroughly despised. Especially if you ask certain questions: Why would the firm's lead hit-man be over six feet tall with shockingly blonde hair and albino eyes (Tobin Bell) i.e. easy to remember? Or why is Cruise's character able to do acrobatic somersaults (in perhaps one of the silliest moments in film history)?So just give in to this handsomely filmed lightweight thriller with a straight-through piano score and some great actors dumbing down for the sake of being in a Tom Cruise blockbuster. Gene Hackman, as Cruise's personal mentor... a charming, womanizing lawyer who loves the vacationing aspect of his job... David Strathaim, as Cruise's glibly laid-back jailbird brother... Terry Kinney, as a seemingly innocent lawyer who initially puts Cruise at ease... And Gary Busey as a fast talking private eye help elevate things: at least for as long as they're on screen. But the show belongs to Cruise, who, as usual, delivers this pizza with tons of cheese and, unless you're expecting steak or caviar, it'll fill you up as needed.",The Firm

It's not an action movie no... but it doesn't make it boring. Smart plots aren't boring.Brilliant bluesy/jazzy piano soundtrack by Dave Grusin. I enjoy it greatly even without the movie. Every actor does a great job, especially Tom Cruise who in this movie is likable, compared to movies like Top Gun and Cocktail where he is annoying and slimy. Here he is much more believable, sympathetic and has matured as an actor. One of his best performances. One thing I didn't like though is how he handled the situation at the beach, and got away with it in the end. Setup or not, it wasn't a happy ending for me",The Firm

It was pretty close, with the difference mainly lying in the ending, and that where Sydney Pollack makes this story go from good to great: The book, at the end, makes Mitch out to be a coward and a traitor at the end, by making him give into the FBI. But, in the film, Mitch is seen as a hero who doesn't give into anyone. The FBI doesn't win and the Mafia doesn't win. Mitch wins. He bows down to no one. Tom Cruise also plays a *great* Mitch McDeere, with a lot of intensity and charisma. You cheer for him as the protagonist. Holly Hunter is top-notch with her portrayal of the vulnerable, secretary turned accomplice Tammy. Gene Hackman is also great as Avery Tolar, the one bad guy who sympathizes with Mitch and Abby. Such a great screen presence. His scenes while they're in the Kaymen Islands are key ones to watch. Jeanne Tripplehorn finally makes up for her role in ""Basic Instinct"" as Abby McDeere, the ""cheated wife"", not only by her husband, but also by the firm he works for. Sydney Pollack showcases some of his best work as director, especially by the opening segment that describes Mitch McDeere perfectly in the span of less than 10 minutes.

The movie is too plodding and edited with so many inconsequential scenes it just sucks the life out of the suspense...the best actors in the film are actually the supporting cast from Holly Hunter to Ed Harris..even the great and understated Steven Hill gives you more to think about than three quarters of this movie as Cruise and Tripplehorne give us NOTHING to really care about with mopey facial expressions and Cruise's trademark ""hold on I am thinking while staring the other direction and pointing my fingers and then standing with a perplexed look to mug for the cam in a manner WE KNOW somethings about to go down""...and then there is the score....where do I begin...the jazzy piano added NOTHING to the supposed suspense the book has created..I firmly expected a dance number to come out of nowhere in the middle of this....totally inappropriate music for this....Gene Hackman is...is......GENE HACKMAN....nuff said......the ending is just ridiculous anti-climatic and makes you think ""are you SERIOUS?....to sum this up the best way possible..my favorite scene in the whole movie involved Gary Busey...chew on that for a second or three....LOL",The Firm

Brimley has never to my knowledge had a role similar to this before and he was excellent. I had not really been impressed with his acting but in this movie I definitely was. The suspense flowed naturally and never seemed forced just to fill time. The music score was very good.

149,dragonslayor,My personal fav ... bar none.,10,16 September 2000,"My all-time top-rated film; this one has it all.  The characters, not just the leads, are real and substantive.  Hackman almost steals the show. Cruise takes you with him as a young comer with the world before him: brains, energy, confidence, a beautiful wife (Tripplehorn, who is gorgeous, sensuous, supportive and yet strongly her own person), and a dream job. Cruise and Tripplehorn sizzle throughout the movie, but never more so than in the penultimate scene when he repeatedly asks ""Have I lost you?""  Her answer simply melts the heart.The writing is of course superb, and, although the ending, different from the book, has been criticized, I found it an amazing extrication from a situation which compels the viewer to believe is hopeless.  You want the stars to somehow escape their continually worsening plight - both within their personal lives together and with the evil external forces that have ensnared them, and the movie ending does not disappoint.Disappointing, however are the last few moments, which are disjointed and seem to belong to another movie.  It amazes me that something better could not have been done.  It could only have been worse had our heros ridden into a sunset to the strumming of a western guitar ...",The Firm

He changes things for absolutely no reason and the second half of the book is completely different and a lot more exciting. I don't know why Mitch tells his wife he's had the affair. It adds tension that doesn't need to be there. The firm is not that type of movie.

152,gogo-cordell,Tom Cruise heads cast in fast-paced legal drama.,9,1 March 2009,"Tom Cruise plays Mitch McDeere, a Harvard graduate who lands a job with a Memphis law firm. It sounds too good to be true: a huge salary, a luxurious house, a Mercedes. But before long, the dream turns into a nightmare. His wife Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn) wants a simple life. Unlike Mitch, she grew up with wealth, so she's not obsessed with money. When she realizes that Mitch has to work day and night to prepare for the bar exam, as well as working on cases, she begins to worry that the romance has gone out of their marriage. Soon she has more serious concerns. Two lawyers with the firm are killed in a suspicious boat accident. Then she learns that the beautiful home the firm gave them is bugged. And it just keeps getting worse. An FBI agent (Ed Harris as Wayne Tarrance) is following Mitch. He warns him that the firm is under investigation for ties to the mob. Mitch has no choice but to assist the FBI in the investigation (by collecting evidence against the firm). If he attempts to run, he'll be killed just like the other lawyers. ""The Firm"" is a taut drama skillfully directed by Sydney Pollack, who has made such diverse films as ""Tootsie"" and ""Out of Africa."" The cast is loaded with talent, beginning with the three actors already mentioned. Gene Hackman has never been better as Avery Tolar, a corrupt attorney with a romantic side, a tragic figure who is destroyed by the firm. There are other strong supporting performances: Wilford Brimley as William Devasher, a grimly-humorous enforcer for the firm; David Strathairn as Ray McDeere, Mitch's convict brother; Holly Hunter as Tammy Hemphill, a seemingly ditsy secretary who helps Mitch pull off his intricate plan; and Gary Busey as Eddie Lomax as the tough ex-con/private eye who pays the ultimate price for asking questions about dead lawyers. But the weight of the film ultimately rests on the shoulders of Cruise, and he doesn't disappoint. Mitch is a supremely confident young man who strongly believes that lawyers can be both successful and ethical. And it is this idealism that gives him the strength to navigate through the minefield that is the firm.",The Firm

It's just a by the numbers movie. I wish one of the executive would make more effort to reach out to other directors who are super-talented, but are not in the fraternity.

I enjoyed every minute of this intense thriller, from the beginning until the surprise ending (though I'm tempted to tell what happens, I'll let you find out for yourself!).  I tell a bit of the story here, so it is possible they may be regarded as **SPOILERS**, so if you don't want to know anything about the movie, STOP READING.Tom Cruise shows off one of his best performances as Mitch McDeere, the formally poor boy who goes off to Harvard Law School and graduates cume laude.  He goes to many prestigious firms, all of whom want him real bad. One firm, though, Bendini, Lambert, and Locke, strikes his interest.  In return for joining, he gets $100,000 per year, and a shiny new Mercedes. He accepts, and he and his wife, Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn), fly to Memphis, where they get a nice house, with most of it payed for by the firm.  The story unfolds, and through the course of events, Mitch learns the dark truth about his firm. . .The acting is superb in this film.  Tom Cruise's performance reminds me of his in 'A Few Good Men'; strong and realistic.  Jeanne Tripplehorn is a pleasure to watch as his wife Abby.  Gene Hackman plays a surprisingly sympathetic role as a partner in the firm.  Holly Hunter (who received an Oscar-nomination for her role) is almost humorous as a southern-twanged secretary-turned victim-turned accomplice.  Ed Harris brings his usual fine acting style as an FBI agent, and veteran actor Hal Holbrook plays a grandfatherly lawyer more evil than his attitude would imply.  Sydney Pollack's directing is radiant, and the single piano score by Dave Grusin can be both calm and content, then become fast and furious.
In conclusion, 'The Firm' is a fun, fresh thriller, and it should be enjoyed for years to come.",The Firm

Cruise is good, but less effective- he gets a lot better in the last 45 minutes of the film though. What really surprised me was how good the directing was, in a part designed for someone to look like John Grisham's book. There are so many admirable things in this movie, and the whole concept was very intriguing.

As for the movie, I wonder if the script writers actually read Grisham's book or if they just read a Coles Notes version of it because most scenes are completely false and the ones that are similar to the book have been completely altered. Basically all the best stuff from the book has been left out of the movie making it a weak and formulaic presentation (hopefully Grisham has never watched this movie, it would make him angry).

But overall, this is an absolute delight, to watch a realistic, grounded and INTELLIGENT thriller. It's certainly very refreshing to watch a movie like this.

As he is one of the brightest students of the batch, he gets plenty of offers from the country's leading law firms, but the law firm which he chooses to work in, was going to change his life forever.He got hired in small law firm in Memphis, offering him an unexpectedly large salary, a BMW, a sign-on bonus, use of corporate jet, 10 years contract and a lifestyle he ever dreamed for him and Abby, his wife. They were unaware of the facts about the firm and everything seems perfect to Mitch as all of these he ever wanted was there. {SPOILER ALERT} But after some days Mitch realized that some conspiracy is going on in the firm and soon he found out that Firm is linked with the a Mafia family called ""Moroltos"", and soon FBI came after Mitch to reveal the facts about firm. Now he had to run from both FBI and firm. Overall plot is good and the focus is mainly on Mitch and the firm. In the movie, firm searches for the candidate who are married, young and from poor background, who can be disillusioned with the money. Tom's acting is appreciable and story is changed a little bit from that of novel to create better climax. In my opinion the story of film is not better than the original screen play of the novel but overall film is perfect for the viewers who like mystery, drama with thriller.",The Firm

I thoroughly enjoy all the actors in the movie and their characters ... when I read who else might have been chosen for the parts I just shake my head ... no one but Tom, Jeanne and Gene could be Mitch, Abby, or Avery. And Tammy - oh my, you just can't beat HOLLY in anything! As I said I am simple folk but I know what I like and what I'll spend money on ... isn't that what HOLLYWOOD, et al really cares about anyway?",The Firm
175,bwcobbs,Wrecks the Masterpiece of a Book,1,2 June 2015,"This is an example of Hollywood rewriting at its worst ! They changed this wonderful thriller of a book into a long boring commercial for the supposed high ethical standards of the legal community. A lawyer is willing to risk his life to protect client information?!? Nonsense ! The book is fast paced and interesting and yes the lawyers are just as sleazy as the mafia. This is not to say that all lawyers are sleazy but nor are they all saints. Some reviewers have said that the music was ridiculous and they are right. Unlike the book, the pace is so slow, that you will have the urge to start checking your email. Be sure to MISS this movie.",The Firm
176,hehawe,A bit of disapointment here,5,26 July 2020,"I've read in another review here that this movie is better than a book. No, it isn't. From my point of view, the most beautiful scenes were rewritten, and the idea has been destroyed. Mainly the ending is utterly different in the movie, creating a hero from Mitch, but the final scenes in the book is much more a thriller, believable and logical. All that final chasing that the story was inevitably leading to, has been removed. The movie ending is cheap in my eyes. It was like just creating a hero from the main character at all costs. And therefore, Avery's character suffers in the movie as well as his motives are not believable too.
Gene and Tom are great here, yes. But having fewer and fewer pages to read, I was looking forward more and more to the movie. I watched it a day after I finished the book and it was all a bitter taste. I liked Holly Hunter the most. So, if you seen the movie and you liked it, don't read a book. Because after the last page having read, you'd have to change your mind.",The Firm
177,raj472,The movie vs. the book,9,12 May 2008,"Wow! I've seen this movie at least a half a dozen times, but never got around to reading the book until this week. This is truly one of those rare instances in which the MOVIE IS BETTER THAN THE BOOK! I couldn't believe it! The basic plot and characters are the same, but the movie is better paced, more clever, and has a much better ending. In the book, Mitch McDeere is a somewhat arrogant rude jerk, and doesn't have many redeeming qualities. He simply takes the money, copies the files, gets his brother busted out of prison, turns the files over to the FBI, and gets on a boat with his brother and Abby. In the end, the Firm has been indicted and Mitch plans on sailing around the Cayman Islands for the rest of his life living off the money. The book is worth a read just to see the vast differences, but don't expect the same level of entertainment you got from the movie!",The Firm
178,binablair,sober pleasure of legal logic,6,3 May 2006,"The sober pleasure of legal logicNah, not that, this is not one of those movies that makes you want to be a lawyer. (Those movies are rare). I really liked the script to this movie, in addition to the casting. One can always see those little quirks of characters. I guess not every movie has to have circuitous completion. I still like this movie a lot, and would recommend it to anyone who isn't looking for the most complicated of legal situations that cannot be understood by the viewer. I am not a fan of these legal thriller things  never read a book by John Grisham (I've never been that bored on holiday!) and didn't find the glut of films from his work to be as inspiring as their box office success would suggest that they were. Despite this I always try to give a film an honest crack of the whip and so I sat to watch it. It's good.",The Firm
