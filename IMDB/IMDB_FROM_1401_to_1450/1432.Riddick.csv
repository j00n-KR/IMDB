0,bkoganbing,The wildlife gets restless,5,30 September 2013,I've always thought of Vin Diesel as a cross between Lee Marvin and Sly Stallone. The accent in Riddick is on Marvin's cynicism in this science fiction/action adventure thriller where Diesel is in the title role.Riddick finds Diesel as a fugitive who's been marooned and abandoned on a desert planet with some very unfriendly wildlife there. He's been double crossed in a criminal enterprise and there is a price on his head. That is tempting to a gang of bounty hunters who would like to see some cash for Riddick's expensive head. And there's more offered for him dead than alive. But as we see in the film Riddick is not an easy man to kill.I read that Vin Diesel sunk a lot of his own money toward the completion of Riddick. My guess is he's looking to parlay this into a series. There is enough action and special effects involving the strange wildlife on the planet which get very restless when bounty hunters come.Diesel's fans should be satisfied and we'll see there's a Riddick 2.,Riddick
1,Leofwine_draca,Superficially entertaining,5,6 May 2016,"RIDDICK is the third of a trilogy of films starring Vin Diesel as blind warrior battling aliens in outer space. The first film was PITCH BLACK, an efficient low budget horror/thriller set on a dingy alien planet; the second was THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK, which was a somewhat overblown sci-fi fantasy; this third production is a combination of the two.We're back on a smaller scale here, with Vin Diesel stranded in an inhospitable landscape with only his alien 'dog' for company. The relationship between man and 'dog' is one of the highlights of the movie. Soon enough some bad guys enter the fray, a team of mercenaries including the hulking Dave Bautista, and plentiful action ensues.On a superficial level, this is entertaining stuff. There's rarely a slow moment and lots of action to make your mind off the familiarity of the storyline. Another plus is that the CGI effects, both landscapes and creatures, are very good indeed. I saw this film in high definition and it looked fantastic throughout. Diesel has always been good in these stoic parts too, so he doesn't disappoint either. If you're looking for depth, nuance, or intricacy, you're likely to be disappointed; if CGI action is all you care for, then you'll likely enjoy this one.",Riddick
2,SnoopyStyle,More like Pitch Black but the movie misses 'Jack',7,29 August 2014,"Riddick (Vin Diesel) is the new Lord Marshall and not comfortable with the position. Others like Vaako aren't happy either. Riddick wants to go back home to Furya. Only Vaako deceives him and leaves for dead in not-Furya. He finds an unmanned bounty hunter base and activates the emergency beacon. First a rough group of mercs led by Santana (Jordi Mollà) lands. Then a second group of more professional merc lands with Boss Johns (Matt Nable) searching for answers to his son's mission in the first movie. His second in command is Dahl (Katee Sackhoff).Riddick is back. It has some fun. It's a bit of horror and a lot of action. It's much more closer to the first movie. That's a good move. However it doesn't have a character similar to Jack in this one. Jack brought out Riddick's humanity. He doesn't have that tenderness. In the same vein, Katee Sackhoff is the new Radha Mitchell and there are a different breed of monsters with a new characteristic.",Riddick
3,Prismark10,Monsters unleashed,5,6 January 2014,"Pitch Black was a low budget 'B' film that attained a cult following and made Vin Diesel's anti hero Riddick a force to be reckoned with.The sequel bought us planet Furya, Dame Judi Dench and the Necromongers who Riddick became the ruler of. However Chronicles was flabby, portentous and not a big box office hitWith the third film 'Riddick' we are back to basics. The Necromongers are quickly forgotten.Riddick goes looking for his home planet and finds himself in a desolate, harsh world, near dead with monsters lurking and then mercenaries arrive looking for his head.Then a storm unleashing heavy rain on the desert transforms the environment that unleashes giant scorpion type monsters. You got it, we have a rehash of Pitch Black. Instead of darkness bringing out the monsters, it is rain.Once again mercenaries are being picked off by Riddick before they form an uneasy alliance.The CGI was pretty good but the film felt too long and it became predictable. You sort of know one of the dog like creatures will befriend Riddick, you know some bad guys will arrive on the planet and then some monsters would emerge.Pitch Black was a one picture wonder and the sequels have done nothing much to enhance the series.Diesel cares about his character but given the lacklustre box office of the third film I doubt the film series can really continue much further.",Riddick
4,claudio_carvalho,Riddick is Back,6,19 August 2018,"""Riddick"" is an action sci-fi movie with the return of Riddick. The story is entertaining and simple with top-notch special effects. Riddick is left alone in an arid planet with predators. His only way out is activating an emergency beacon that alerts two groups of mercenaries that land on the planet with their spaceships to chase Riddick. There are many funny moments and quotes and for fans it is worthwhile watching. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Riddick 3""",Riddick
5,nogodnomasters,AND THEN THERE ARE LEGENDARY BAD DAYS,8,28 August 2018,"Tired of being a ruler, Riddick (Vin Diesel) decides he wants to return to his home planet, only to be double crossed. In the first few minutes of the film Riddick displays his toughness by setting a broken bone in his own leg...then he puts screws in it. He makes friends with an alien dingo. Eventually he goes up against only eleven seasoned bounty hunters...and we know how that goes.The special effects were decent. The dialogue meets our tough guy expectations. Good mix of drama and action, with a touch of levity. The plot is very simple, Riddick vs. bounty hunters vs. alien creatures. Good popcorn film.Parental Guide: F-bomb, nudity (Katee Sackhoff + full frontal) sex talk.",Riddick
6,kosmasp,Pitch Black reloaded,8,22 May 2014,"After the not well received sequel (Chronicles of Riddick), this gets back to Riddicks roots. Not the same planet, but very similar in the story department. Some things are tweaked (though even in Chronicles they tried something with the sun/night/dark situation) of course, to suit the story better.The movie has enough violence and enough cool character moments for Riddick and his fans to relish in. But there is pauses in it. I liked them, but I was expecting people to be really angry at those moments, where the movie takes its time. And when I say it takes its time, I mean it really takes its time. Something like me pushing and repeating my point would be a good example of some situations in the movie. Just be aware of those.",Riddick
7,Tweekums,A solid return for Riddick,7,25 January 2019,"Having been betrayed Riddick is left for dead on a sun scorched desert planet. He isn't entirely alone though; there are plenty of dangerous creatures who see him as a tasty snack. He fights past these, and even makes a pet of one doglike creature before finding an abandoned outpost where he activates an emergency beacon. Two ships respond; the first a group of mercenaries who wand Riddick's head for the reward, the second captained by a man who wants Riddick for more person reasons. These two groups don't initially want to work together but after Riddick reduces their numbers somewhat they are forced to. They don't realise that there are more dangerous things than Riddick on the planet until after he removes their ability to leave.After the slightly disappointing 'Chronicles of Riddick' this film is a return to form. It has a similar central idea to 'Pitch Black'; namely a small group of people on a planet with dangerous creatures which predominantly appear under certain conditions. It starts well with Riddick surviving against various creatures and befriending his 'dog'. When the mercenaries arrive they become the centre of attention rather than Riddick which was a pity as they were a fairly cliché group of hard-men, and one woman, who are constantly posturing as they work to catch Riddick. Things get better again in the final act when it is the survivors struggling against some nasty creatures. The effects are pretty good and there are plenty of exciting and scary moments. The cast is decent enough; Vin Diesel stands out as he does what his fans want. Of the others the most memorable is Katee Sackhoff, the only woman in the film to have anything other than a tiny role. Overall I think fans of the previous films should enjoy this although it isn't absolutely necessary to have seen them to enjoy this.",Riddick
8,ma-cortes,Nice third installment in which Riddick is left for dead on a sun-scorched planet and faces off brutal bounty hunters and an alien race of predators,7,27 November 2018,"A cool and nail-biting sequel that will keep you on the edge of your seat , being well starred and splendily made. Intriguing as well as intelligent Sci-fi movie , being compellingly directed by a good filmmaker , David Twohy . It stars an awesome cast :. Jordi Mollà , Katee Sackhoff , Dave Bautista , Matt Nable , Bokeem Woodbine , Raoul Trujillo , Conrad Pla , and , of course , Vin Diesel . Thrilling film packs intrigue , intense scenes , noisy action , chills and astonishing suspense . In this is a science fiction thriller Riddick (breakthrough film role of actor Vin Diesel) is at an unknown planet with apparently no life and where mysterious events spread across the land full of bloodthirsty creatures and he finds himself as a survivor who is marooned on a strange location . Soon, however, he finds himself fighting for survival against alien predators more lethal than any human he's encountered .The only way off is for Riddick to activate an emergency beacon and alert mercenaries who rapidly descend to the planet in search of their bounty . As there appears various warriors , ominous killers and bloody bounty hunters who go after him . But then , they learn that a merciless enemy is about to appear . The invaders find themselves being hunted by the planet's flesh-eating alien inhabitants when the planet is engulfed in darkness .The first ship to arrive carries a new breed of merc, more lethal and violent, while the second is captained by a man whose pursuit of Riddick is more personal. With time running out and a storm on the horizon that no one could survive, his hunters won't leave the planet without Riddick's head as their trophy . Then , the group is stranded in the desert and the greatest danger facing our starring has been the planet's best kept secret...until now .Rule the Dark . Survival Is His RevengeFast-moving , creepy , scary and gory Sci-Fi with thrills , chills , suspense and some familiar elements from the previous outing in which the infamous Riddick arrives on a planet , he has been left for dead on a sun-scorched location that appears to be lifeless and finds himself up against monsters and nasty enemies . ""Riddick"" takes place five years after the former movie , ""The Chronicles of Riddick,"" which was set five years after the original film ""Pitch Black."" This means that ""Riddick"" takes place a decade after ""Pitch Black"" even though ""Riddick"" was released thirteen years after ""Pitch Black."" This is a pretty good as well as bloody movie with violent events ,thrills , intriguing incidents , starked outdoors , and chilling scenes . This is a decent sequel to ¨The chronicles of Riddick¨ (2004) with nteresting screenplay from Jim Wheat , Ken Wheat and David Twohy , though the character of Riddick was a woman in an early rough draft of the script. The Pitch Black (2000) original film was supposed to be a standalone film. But, during production, Vin Diesel, and the cast and crew had become intrigued by the character of Riddick, and the ending, in which Riddick was supposed to die, was changed, so a possible sequel with Vin Diesel returning as Riddick could happen. The original film spawned three sequels, Dark fury (animated) , Chronicles of Riddick (2004) and Riddick (2013). Vin Diesel gives a hard-ass acting , as usual , as an escaped He-man with a bounty on his head who has nothing to lose . The contact lenses Vin Diesel wore in the movie, while a prototype during production, were briefly available to the public from Lens Quest following the release of the film . Diesel said that while shooting the scenes where his character was in a suspended animation , he had a claustrophobia attack at one point during shooting and had to be taken out of the chamber. Vin Diesel agreed to make a cameo appearance in The fast and the furious : Tokyo Race (2006) in exchange for the rights to the ""Riddick"" franchise from Universal Pictures. This allowed him to produce this film independently. Nice support cast such as Jordi Mollá , Karl Urban , Dave Bautista , Bokeem Woodbine , Raoul Trujillo , Conrad Plá , and the beautiful as well as tough Katee Sackhoff . It was given a ""PG-13¨ for intense sequences of violent action , profanity and some bad language. An unrated version, with more violence and language was later released. The fantastic creatures and various monsters were perfectly designed and excellent production design by Joseph C. Nemec III , though excessive use of computer generator , especially on the mascot-dog . Pulsating and stirring musical score by Graeme Revell . Colorful cinematography by David Eggby, he shows splendidly the bizarre images from Montréal, Québec, Canada Burnaby , Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada . However , due to a large number of visual effect shots, the movie had to be shot digitally. As a compromise, David Twohy added a subtle film grain effect throughout the film .The motion picture was well written and directed by David Twohy , it had a 60 days shooting schedule. David is an expert writer and director of competent Sci-Fi movies . As his first picture was the acceptable ¨Timescape¨ . He also wrote ¨Warlock¨, ¨Waterworld ¨, a script for ¨Alien 3¨ in 1988, but it was rejected . Back in May of 2000 , Fox Studios once inquired for his availability to write and direct ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator"" , but turned down the offer due to scheduling conflicts . David subsequently directed ¨Below¨, the successful ¨Pitch Black¨ with Radha Mitchell , Cole Hauser , Claudia Black , Lewis Fitzgerald , Simon Burke , John Moore and Keith David . It was followed by ¨Chronicles of Riddick¨(2004) with a good cast as Colm Feore , Thandie Newton , Judi Dench , Alexa Davalos , Karl Urban , Linus Roache and Keith David , here Riddick against an invading empire called the Necromongers, whose leader is a warrior priest who is the chief of a sect with a powerful army commanded by Lord Marshal . Furthermore , a third installment this ¨Riddick¨ (2013) .",Riddick
9,paul_haakonsen,This was a no-brainer...,4,1 December 2013,"Well, if you are looking for a mindless action story with absolutely no purpose or deep storyline, then look no further. Because ""Riddick"" is exactly that.The story here is about Riddick (played by Vin Diesel) who is stuck on some barren wasteland planet where everything is out to kill him. When he finds an abandoned stations and activates a distress beacon, those answering the call are also out to get him.Bam! Done! That was it, the whole storyline summarized right there in two paragraphs. Kinda sad, isn't it?""Riddick"" is an action movie that is dependant on the special effects. Which, I might add, are actually also what keeps the movie afloat and makes it somewhat watchable. However, it starts to become too much when everything on the planet is something that wants to kill Riddick, and it just becomes progressively bigger and more dangerous with each passed obstacle. It was somewhat of a parody, or so it seemed.They attempted to put in some comedy as well, the part with the MRE and the canine, well it was fun in itself, but for this kind of movie, the comedy was not really appropriate.This whole 'one-man-army' concept is really outdated and should have stayed back in the late 1980's and early 1990's with Stallone, Schwarzenegger and the like. It is just a little too unconvincing that one man is capable of such feats all by himself.I watched this movie on the recommended from a colleague at work. Now, of course what you like or dislike is relative and varies from person to person. He spoke highly of this movie, but it just didn't suit my particular taste in movie entertainment. I want to be entertained, and not just watch Vin Diesel pretending to be an überhuman on screen while beating up one CGI alien after the other.",Riddick
10,hitchcockthelegend,Maybe you're all scared of the wrong thing.,7,19 March 2016,"Unsurprisingly reactions to this, the third outing for Vin Diesel's sci-fi based anti-hero, has been very mixed. In truth it's hardly a great film of the ""must see"" kind, and it does in fact cleave very close to Pitch Black, the first and most superior of the Riddick trilogy. However, there's a whole bunch of science fiction fun to be had here.Plot has Riddick left for dead on a inhospitable planet, where he finds himself up against some alien creatures. His only hope of getting off the planet is to bring notice of his whereabouts, which brings two ships to where he is. Both with crews who have differing reasons for wanting to capture the enigmatic convict...And thus we get a beautifully filmed sci-fier that features beasties of both the human and alien kind. Action and moody histrionics are never far away, and Diesel is wonderfully muscular, macho, course and scary. Some of the CGI is weak, and naturally much of the film's coincidences and contrivances have to be forgiven if one wants a popcorn and beer good time of it. So the requisite here is to chill out and enjoy me thinks! 7/10",Riddick
11,LeonLouisRicci,Apology Accepted,8,13 February 2014,"Director/Writer David Twohy seems to be Sincerely Saying ""I'm Sorry"" for Allowing the Riddick Story to get Away from what it is in that Dismal and Overblown, Operatic Sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick (2004) and has Returned to the Glory Days of Lower Budgets and Up Close and Personal Mayhem.This one has a Close Resemblance to Pitch Black (2000), some say too close, but it is Different Enough and No One can call it a Remake. The First Half of this Entertaining and Gutsy Return to Closer Quarters and Tension Driven Fun, has Riddick in Prepper Mode and using His Seemingly Super-Hero Talents while Camping Out and Preparing for what's to Come.The Movie Lightens Up a Bit with a New Found Friend and that's a Good Thing because Once the Slaughter Begins it is a Dark and Violent Affair. Twohy keeps Things Pithy with some Locker Room Banter and has a Good Time with some Macho Posturing. Forgetting, for the Most Part, the Second Movie this can Stand Aside the First and is a Welcome and Accepted Apology for its Predecessor's Misstep.",Riddick
12,utgard14,"""I'll ride it like I stole it"" and other deep thoughts...",5,29 March 2014,"The first Riddick movie, Pitch Black, was a taut sci-fi/action/horror blend with a strong cast. Its visuals, while creative, were grounded in reality. One of the best movies released around the millennium. The second one....not so much. It was a kind of stupid sci-fi space opera adventure movie with over-the-top designs for aliens, costumes, sets, etc. that kind of reminded me of Dune. Not a big fan of Dune, by the way. So I was hesitant to really check this Riddick movie out, despite the cast looking like something close to what the first film had. But then a friend told me this was closer to the first movie than the second, and the trailers I saw also fit that description. Within the first half-hour, I was very disappointed as the movie was already a lot like the second one with stupid-looking alien animals and Karl Urban looking like something from a cheesy syndicated sci-fi show from the '90s.About a half-hour in, it changes tone and becomes something that is closer to the first film in spirit. The plot's about Riddick (Vin Diesel) being stranded on an alien planet with strange and deadly creatures. He activates an emergency beacon which brings two ships to get him, one full of bounty hunters and the other mercenaries headed by Boss Johns, the father of William Johns from Pitch Black. There is a huge problem here with the casting of Boss Johns as the actor is roughly the same age as Cole Hauser was in the first movie. How he could then be that man's father is never explained. I've read fan explanations but director/writer David Twohy never bothers to give an explanation of his own in the film. Lazy, insulting writing that gives the finger to the viewer.It's an overlong movie that really could have been cut severely. Had the first thirty minutes especially been trimmed down, the movie would have been so much better. Still, it's watchable, though nothing special. There are some super cheesy moments (""Balls deep"" and pretty much all of Riddick's interactions with Katee Sackhoff's supposedly lesbian character, for example). The movie actually works best on the level of cheesy B actioner. The director's cut has an ending so ridiculous I burst out laughing. Pretentious types, I swear. Just make your silly Riddick movie, Twohy. Leave the profundity to people who know what they're doing.",Riddick
13,zardoz-13,"Welcome Back, Riddick!!!",9,8 September 2013,"You've got to like Vin Diesel to enjoy his movies. Diesel plays the same 'trouble-shooter' character or a variation in all his crime thrillers. He plays a narrow range of roles. Occasionally, his co-stars make an impression, but he dominates the action. Indeed, the gravel-voiced Diesel commands attention. He is a brawny individual, with a solid, muscular physique, a Telly Savalas haircut, and gimlet eyes. Diesel lacks neither nerve nor authority. In the first Riddick epic ""Pitch Black,"" our anti-heroic, convict with man-made night vision contended with carnivorous, pelican-like dinosaur birds with huge raptor teeth. Obsessed by its insatiable lust for blood, these fowl creatures descended onto Riddick and company like bats and attacked in waves. ""Pitch Black"" concerned survival under the worst conditions against a deadly supernatural animal. The stranger in a strange land applied almost equally to this creepy sci-fi saga because the crash victims were tourists to a planet teeming with ""Jurassic Park"" predators. Basically, ""Pitch Black"" (2000) resembled an old-fashioned Tarzan movie whose setting had been altered to outer space. Instead of a private plane crashing in a jungle filled with deadly tribes and tigers, a galactic cargo vessel go down on a planet ruled by deadly carnivores. In the Tarzan movie, the heroes battled their way to safety after encounters with lions, baboons, elephants, and crocodiles. Director David Twohy's original generated considerable suspense with a number of shocks and surprises to compensate for its standard-issue plot. You knew Vin would triumph. This problem plagued the ambitious ""Chronicles of Riddick"" (2004) that plunged the protagonist into a completely different plot. He tangled with human rather than inhuman adversaries. ""Chronicles"" appeared five years after ""Pitch Black."" Comparatively, ""Chronicle"" shunned the exotic wildlife, survival-of-the-fittest themes. Instead, it introduced a race of space buccaneers known as the 'Necromongers.' The second Riddick movie looked like a ""Star Wars"" space opera. As the second sequel in the ""Pitch Black"" franchise, director David Towhy's ""Riddick"" shuns the spectacle of ""Chronicles"" and reverts to the primeval survival of the fittest combat with exotic outer space predators. The ""Riddick"" predators surpass the ""Pitch Black"" beasties, and Riddick performs some impressive feats. Altogether, ""Riddick"" tops ""Pitch Black"" but it is neither as spectacular nor as multi-layered as ""Chronicles."" If ""Riddick"" marks your first exposure to the ""Pitch Black"" franchise, you are probably going to be lost when references are made to the previous installments. Meanwhile, Riddick fans will appreciate Twohy's efforts to impose continuity onto the trilogy.If you haven't seen ""The Chronicles of Riddick,"" you may find yourself at a disadvantage. ""Riddick"" opens on a hostile planet where our protagonist has been left to perish. Richard P. Riddick (Vin Diesel of ""xXx"") is in pretty bad shape. The opening scene with a repulsive space vulture that Riddick traps in his fist sums up his predicament. The double-crossing Necromongers have abandoned Riddick and triggered an avalanche that breaks his leg. He jams his foot in a crack in the rocks and straightens out of his injured appendage. ""Riddick"" shows how ""Rambo"" like and resourceful that our hero is. The funniest scene with muted humor shows Riddick faking off a snarling Dingo Doggie. Dingo Doggies are huge, Great Dane hounds with black stripes crossing their yellow fur coats. Eventually, Riddick finds a puppy and trains it. Riddick finds himself in a part of the planet where he cannot leave without crossing a small mud pond. Remember the fairy tale about the bridge and the troll who lived under it? Lurking in this harmless mud pond is a dangerous creature that perambulates on two legs, possesses a long, scorpion-like tail with snapping pincers, and prefers to hide in water. Riddick learns from watching this alien predator that the rest of its body remains submerged until it attacks with a head shaped like the monster in ""Alien"" to seize its prey. Once Riddick calculates a strategy, he kills the creature and stumbles onto an outpost established by space mercenaries for emergencies. Space mercenaries are typically bounty hunters. Riddick activates a signal beacon like the little girl warrior did in ""Hana."" Promptly, two teams of bounty hunters respond. The reward on Riddick's head is doubled if the bounty hunters kill him. Santana (Jordi Mollà of ""Blow"") and his well-armed but rag-tag crew arrive first, while Johns (Matt Nable of ""Killer Elite"") and his team later land. Johns promises Santana that he will let him operate with a free hand. Neither Santana nor Johns realize the kind of adversary that they are going to confront.We never got a clear view of the predators in ""Pitch Black."" ""Riddick"" gives us a front-row seat to appreciate the new predators in all their intimidating glory. ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" contained one scene with caged animals. Riddick is back in his element in ""Riddick,"" and he has his hands filled throughout the film's veritable two hour running time. Mind you, ""Riddick"" doesn't wear out its welcome. Specifically, Riddick unfolds in three sections. Initially, Riddick adapts and recuperates on the planet after the evil Necromongers have abandoned him. He studies his number one enemy, and this predator returns in greater numbers when a massive storm provides it with the conditions to migrate. Riddick is essentially an outer space Rambo. He moves on phantom feet, and you rarely know when he slips up behind you because he is so quiet. Riddick and Santana are at each other's throat, and Santana is a treacherous villain. He murders a defenseless woman after he turns her loose and later cites that his growing attachment to her prompted his homicidal act. Santana promises to collect Riddick's head in a box. The pay-off to this rivalry is like something out of a 1980s' Arnold Schwarzenegger actioneer. For the sake of sheer diversity, Johns' team has a battle-seasoned lesbian who is an expert handling all firearms. Here's hoping we don't have to wait another nine years for the next ""Riddick"" sequel.",Riddick
14,neil-476,Eye-catching retread,7,20 September 2013,"Richard B Riddick, last seen as Boss of the Necromongers, is doublecrossed and left for dead on a hostile planet where he is left fighting mercenaries and critters.David Twohy's third outing for Vin Diesel's Riddick does little more than recycle the centre section of the second film and the latter half of the first film. This isn't a bad thing, though, because there is a visual sensibility to Twohy's vision which is very much its own thing, Diesel's Riddick is an effective and enjoyable protagonist, and the slight plot is perfectly sufficient to hang the action sequences and eye candy on.It is worth pointing out that not only is there quite a lot of bad language this time, there is also some fairly graphic violence. Having said that, if you liked the previous two films, you are likely to enjoy this one. And vice versa.",Riddick
15,morrison-dylan-fan,David Twohy's Riddick series-part 3:Riddick.,8,12 September 2013,"With still having great memories of watching the wild & crazy Action film The Fast and the Furious 6,I decided to take a look at lead actor Vin Diesel's IMDb page to find out what projects he was working on.Quickly finding out that Diesel was heading back to the ""Pitch Black"" universe,I found myself getting really enthusiastic about the title,due to Diesel being joined by actress Katee Sackhoff, (who gave a tremendous performance in Ronald D.Moore's classic TV series Battlestar Galactica) Karl Urban, (who had brought Judge Dredd alive in the sadly underrated Dredd) and former WWF/E wrestler Batista!, (or Dave Bautista,as he has renamed himself to!)which led to me excitingly getting ready to trip the darknessThe plot:Getting left burred alive on an isolated desert planet after being betrayed by his former military commanders,Richard B.Riddick, (who is currently a wanted criminal) pulls himself out of the rubble,and discovers that he's the only person on the planet.Desperate to find a part of the planet that contains water,and also having to deal with a number of small, deadly alien monsters who are ready to attack with their venom at any time. (Which leads to Riddick squeezing the venom out of one of the aliens,so that he can build up an immunity to the creature's poison.)Finding himself unexpectedly becoming friends with an alien dog as he gets immune to the poison on a mountain side that looks out onto the planet's vast savanna'a,Richard and his trusty dog, (who thanks to Riddick has also been made immune)battle through the hordes of deadly alien's hiding in the mud holes of the planet,until they reach a near by savanna.Sadly their chance to relax by the savanna are ruined,due to huge storm's gathering around the planet,which will allow the mud based aliens to reach the near by savanna's.Desperate to get off the planet before the storms hit,Riddick searches around for anything that can send a signal to the outside world.Almost giving up hope,Richard is relived to discover a dusty,but still working mercenary station,which contains a tracking signal beacon.With having a huge bounty on his head that bounty hunters are desperate to grab,Riddick turns on the beacon,and gets set to give the oncoming bounty hunters a welcome that they will never forget.View on the film:Taking a big risk with the film by staying away from delivering any big action scenes for the first 30 minutes,the screenplay by writer/director David Twohy instead builds up a mystical Sci-Fi atmosphere,which despite running the risk of going in an unintentional Comedy direction, (one man and his alien dog!)is saved by Twohy keeping the movie rooted in a gritty Sci-Fi setting,whilst also showing an unexpected sincerity in his building up of Riddick and his dog's (who is brought to life by amazing CGI effects,that keep the character's personality at the centre of the effects) surprisingly touching relationship.After building a strong Sci-Fi atmosphere,and also keeping references to the past movies to a minimum,so that the movie is assessable for new people to the series,whilst also including a number of sly nods that fans can enjoy,Twohy kicks the film into a nail biting action direction,by putting Riddick into ""preditor"" mode,where it is Riddick against two groups of bounty hunters,who despite having better weaponry lack Riddick's skills and ingenuity.Covering the film in a rough'n ready yellow desert colour filter,Twohy reveals an excellent unflinching eye for the movie's expertly handled action scenes,thanks to Twohy giving each of the scenes a brutal rawness which allows for every broken nose punch,""animal trap"" and beheading to be hit with maximum,deadly force.Returning to the role after 9 years,(and also having to re-mortgage his house in order to get the movie made!)Vin Diesel shows that he has not lost his skill of getting Richard B.Riddick to light up the pitch black darkness,with Diesel brilliantly making sure,that despite showing a bit more of a human side,that the centre of Riddick remains a man who is a highly intelligent,ruthless murderer.Joining Diesel,Katee Sackhoff, (who also appears naked in the film)gives a vicious performance as bounty hunter Dahl,who may possibly be Riddick's first serious opponent,whilst Dave Bautista and a cameo-ing Karl Urban give the film a good macho punch,as Riddick begins to find out how ""pitch black"" things can really go.",Riddick
16,anaconda-40658,Rotten Riddick.,2,15 September 2015,"Riddick (2013): Dir: David Twohy / Cast: Vin Diesel, Jordi Molla, Matthew Nable, Katee Sackhoff, Dave Bautista: They should have named the title character Ridiculous for all the nonsense he has been through with three stupid films. We have a world of visual effects and creatures that wouldn't be any more believable than if they were shipped from Sesame Street complete with the letter ""R."" Vin Diesel once again portrays Riddick whom he played twice before and he seeks refuge from enemies out to take his head. Of course, he is sought after and a lot of pointless ass kicking follows with a lot of under developed characters meeting a nasty end when deadly creatures emerge at night. Riddick has special glasses and eye sight that allows him to see in the dark. Unfortunately for Diesel it doesn't prevent him from reading a terrible script that also includes his less than inspiring narration. Director David Twohy is skilled but has wasted time on three of these useless projects when his talent was accompanied with a better script with the underrated and suspenseful The Perfect Getaway. Besides Diesel the rest of the cast portray mainly faceless imbeciles with a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time when it comes to survival. Just like Pitch Black this manages to be every bit as pointless and stupid, and it carries on the whole theme of people doing stupid things that ultimately result in their mindless death. Perhaps the best way to deal with a film like this is to shove it deep into a trash compactor and hope that it eventually recycles into a better film. Or at least a sardine can.

17,FlashCallahan,Betrayed again....,2,10 December 2013,"Betrayed by the Necromongers and left for dead on a remote planet, Riddick learns to adapt to the environment and rediscover his predatory instincts. When a deadly threat appears on the horizon, he is forced to activate an emergency beacon attracting two ships.But one is filled with mercenaries, and the other captained by a man with a vendetta against Riddick......Riddick, or 'Castaway 2: time to beef up', is another in a long line of 2013 blockbusters, and this one commits the greatest cinematic crime of all, its boring, and nothing happens for a long time.Plus it features the most sexist line featured in a film this year, you'll know what it is, because its so cringe worthy and out of place.Diesel spends the majority of the film looking for the new Fast and Furious movie set, while all the while over actors are searching for him.A pre Terminator 2 CGI dog keeps him company, and this has to be the strangest element to the film, a violent science fiction movie actually references Dance With Wolves, and keeps it sincere, this part alone stops the film from being one star.When I heard that they were making another movie, I like many, thought, he's being allowed to make this now because of his other franchise, and I'm not surprised it wasn't received well.Its a poor franchise, even poorer than Highlander, and although Diesel is a adequate actor, the character is as dull as ditch-water.I'm only saying what you're really thinking.A useless dud of a movie.....",Riddick
18,trashgang,"great first 45 minutes, then it goes downhill to end again in a better way",7,5 June 2014,"I was looking forward to this flick because the previous ones were okay and original. The trailer also looked stunning so finally when it came out I was lucky to catch my copy but now that I have seen it I was left with mixed feelings about Riddick. The first 40 minutes are in fact a movie on it's own. You see Riddick (Vin Diesel) resurrecting and curing himself to get fit again for the next mission. It all looked great, the CGI used, the acting, the story itself. But it's when Riddick got sent back to the 'wrong' planet that this flick just turned into a simple flick. There's not that much Riddick after 45 minutes. Sure, he still is a killer who does what he does best but once the bounty hunters do come in this changes in those old western stories, hunting for the bad guy and you can see it coming, the hunter and the bad guy will help each other. I was surprised about Dave Batista (Diaz) who I know for years from the wrestling scene. He do give a good performance. One that also got my attention was Katee Sackhoff (Dahl), she start to get my attention due being the hard lady in Battlestar Galactica and that's what she does best, playing the tough one. Here she has that hard to get lesbian look, and it works. She even surprised me with her nudity scene. Still, not that bad, reminded me a lot of those Italian post-apocalyptic flicks from the eighties. First part was excellent until the hunters arrive, then it's down hill to get back to a better part once Riddick is captured. And sure we will see another entry into the franchise with the open ending.Gore 1/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Riddick
19,siderite,"Lots of machismo, no substance",7,6 December 2013,"Riddick is double-crossed and stranded on yet another hellish planet with an implausible ecosystem. He again masters the art of survival and defeats his (incredibly badly equipped) foes. Too bad he has to do it by always saying ""here is what is going to happen"" then doing it in the most flashy and absurd way. Nice visuals, real man-love generating, but then again, I don't care how big the balls on Riddick are if that is all he does the entire film.In fact, what I found most entertaining was the beginning, when he learns to survive on the planet. The character of Johns was not only really weak, but also completely out of context. He kept talking about his son, but I couldn't remember any Johns from a previous Riddick film and I doubt many of the people did. Katee Sackhoff does her usual angry female role and even shows up a breast (nice one, Katee), but does nothing else but stay true to her nickname (Doll). If I have to choose a favorite character in this film, besides Riddick, is the one interpreted by Bautista, another impressive male specimen. However at the end he just does a 180 and breaks consistency, or at least this is how it felt to me.Bottom line: it felt more like a Schwarzenegger movie like Predator and, while it was entertaining, it held nothing but empty interactions, implausible monsters and a lot of showing off. Besides, it was hard to enjoy the movie when all I did was run ""how it should have ended"" scenarios in my head.",Riddick
20,MovieAddict2016,Panders almost exclusively to the die-hard fans -- which is good news if you're a die-hard fan.,5,17 January 2014,"I enjoyed ""Pitch Black"" when it came out in 2000 but admittedly never got around to seeing the higher-budgeted sequel, which was both a commercial and critical under-performer in 2004. There probably never would have been another sequel if the Fast and Furious franchise hadn't reinvigorated Vin Diesel's star power -- he is if nothing else quite a wry businessman, and, as a producer of the 'Fast' series, which has been hugely successful for Universal, part of his contract stipulation for signing on to films six, seven and eight was that the studio would fund a third Riddick movie.Thus, after many years, we have another film featuring the character Riddick. Listening to fans who were underwhelmed by the PG-13 wannabe- franchise over-reaching of the second movie, Riddick apparently returns to the roots of Pitch Black, with plenty of foul language, ultra- violence and full-frontal female nudity within the first 20 minutes, all basically just to titillate fanboys who cried afoul of the PG-13 rated first sequel.The beginning of the movie is quite good, as it features Riddick (Diesel) trying to survive on an alien planet. This extended sequence eventually comes to an end, which is a shame, because it's the best part of the movie.Then we get a very fan-oriented you-won't-understand-it-if-you-are-a- casual-fan storytelling device that thrusts Riddick into a man-vs-team- of-mercenaries scenario reminiscent of the original movie. Problem is, it's never quite as thrilling or fun as the first movie, and the glaringly poor CGI (it was funded on a relatively low budget with plenty of obvious green-screening) really detracts from the experience.Riddick is by definition a vanity project for its star, as he literally demanded the studio fund it in order to star in another one of their pictures, and it's clear that both Diesel and director/writer Twohy love Riddick and attempt to truly mythologize the character, framing him stoically and often displaying his actions in a kind of prophetic slow- motion glory. At a certain point it becomes increasingly laughable and kind of awkward and it's clear that Diesel and Twohy were both surrounded by too many yes-men (in fact, they probably were each other's yes men) and someone should have intervened to bring them down to earth a little bit.The action isn't particularly great, the effects are atrocious, and it's never as simplistically fun as the original Pitch Black because it tries to tie in waaay too many mythologies and story lines within its own universe.What this all means is that, for the minority of die-hard fans of the franchise/character, ""Riddick"" the movie will be exactly what they want. But for casual fans like myself and the majority of movie-goers -- who perhaps saw the first one or two films in the series but don't recall every minute detail of the franchise's universe -- it will prove to be a frustratingly alienating experience, akin to a non-Trekkie watching one of the lesser ""Star Trek"" movies from 15 - 20 years ago, when they were so self-reliant upon their own closed world that they completely failed to connect with the mainstream.I'm not bashing Riddick for being fan-serving -- it is, after all, a vanity project made almost exclusively for fans, and I'm happy for them if this is the movie they waited 10 years for. I will say, however, that for casual filmgoers, it will prove to be a frustrating experience, and many recent sci-fi series (like the ""Trek"" reboot) have proved that it's possible to make great entertainment that panders to die-hard fans while still pleasing the casual movie-goer. ""Riddick"" may have done better financially and critically if it had attempted the latter.",Riddick
21,KineticSeoul,"A cool homage or more developed version of ""Pitch Black""",7,2 October 2013,"If you like the Riddick character or at least find the character to be interesting and entertaining. Than there is a chance you just might enjoy this one. Personally it's my favorite in the ""Riddick"" franchse so far. It's kind of like a homage or a more developed version of ""Pitch Black"". Like the title, this one really brings out the character and demeanor of Riddick and his capabilities. It sort of reminded me of ""God of War 2"" where after Riddick takes the thrown he falls, and must climb back up. This isn't a amazing movie or the sci-fi movie of the year, but it goes back to it's roots. Of what makes this franchise to stand out, which is the anti-hero Riddick. Riddick is like a ninja/samurai in this with a tamed beast that works as his sidekick. Which I thought was pretty cool, since it reminded me of those badass characters that has a vicious animal sidekick. When it comes the story, it has 3 stages. The first is how Riddick falls and how he needs to use his skill sets in order to survive in a hellish planet. It really does show how resourceful the character Riddick is. The second part is with bounty hunters and mercenaries going on a manhunt for Riddick. The last stage is the team-up in order to survive. Despite few rough edges, this is still a enjoyable flick that you can be entertained while watching it with some buddies. Again if you like the character Riddick, there is a high chance you will enjoy this one. Despite the predictable storyline.7.8/10",Riddick
22,Hellmant,Nostalgic B movie fun and a great addition to an awesome series!,9,8 September 2013,"'RIDDICK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The third film in the 'Chronicles Of Riddick' franchise (following 2000's 'PITCH BLACK' and 2004's 'THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK'). It once again stars Vin Diesel in the title role and was directed and co-written (with Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell) by David Twohy (who did both jobs on the first two films as well). Diesel produced the movie (with Ted Field and Samantha Vincent) and secured the rights (from Universal) in exchange for doing a cameo in ""THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT""). He streamlined the film (from it's predecessor) and had it made for just $38 million (which is much closer to the $23 million budget of the original film, rather than it's sequel's $105 million in costs). 'THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK' barely made it's budget back (in theaters) where as the original film more than doubled it's expenses (in theaters alone), so Diesel's plan was a very smart and effective one. I found the film to be a big improvement over the last installment in the series but still not quite as good as the (now classic) original.After making a deal with Vaako (Karl Urban, reprising his role from the previous film) to give up his position as Lord Marshall of the Necromongers, in exchange for a ride to his home planet of Furya, Richard B. Riddick (Diesel) is betrayed and left for dead on a desert planet inhabited by vicious creatures. He learns to survive on his new home, battling scorpion-like monsters that live in the mud there, and befriends a dingo-like alien dog (that he finds as a pup after it's mother is killed). He later locates a beacon that he uses to alert bounty hunters (of his presence on the planet) and two ships show up full of mercenaries trying to kill him. He uses his survival skills to fight them (one by one) and tries to steal one of their ships (so he can finally return to Furya, like he originally planned).The movie co-stars Katee Sackhoff (of 'BATTLESTAR GALACTICA' fame), former WWE star (and champion) Dave Bautista, Bookeem Woodbine, Jordi Molla and Matt Nable. I loved the film and am a big fan of the series and the character Riddick. I think Diesel is outstanding in the role, he has great presence in movies like this and is an awesome action movie star (similar to those of yesteryear, like Sylvester Stallone). I'm not a big fan of 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' film series but I have enjoyed most of his other movies and he did start out as an indie filmmaker (writing and directing) so he's a hero of mine in that way as well. I like David Twohy's films too and think he's a great sci-fi director. The two together are a good team and while 'THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK' was a slight misstep I think they've more than made up for it with this chapter. It has great effects and it's even moving if you're an animal lover (the dog is fantastic). It's nostalgic B movie fun and a great addition to an awesome series!Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF2KmRw-Kng",Riddick
23,cherold,fun mindless action flick,7,26 January 2014,"After the overly ornate Chronicles of Riddick (which I recall generally enjoying), this movie is an attempt to return to the basic approach of the first film in the series, Pitch Black. It begins with a grueling sequence with Riddick trying to survive on a hostile planet. There's a brief return to the world of Chronicles to give context, and after that it's Riddick against a bunch of bounty hunters.Riddick is the ultimate warrior, smart, tough, generally unsentimental, and always cool as a cucumber. Much of the movie is simply him taking on two groups, one that is clueless as to how dangerous he is, and one less clueless. My strongest complaint involves a point in the movie where the bounty hunters do something so inexplicably stupid that it boggles the mind. Seriously, a group of forth graders would have more sense. But the movie moves so fast that it doesn't matter too much. The attitude towards women is also a little creepy; most of them are victims or scenery, and the one who is tough and capable still has a nude scene and is given the name Dahl (pronounced ""doll"") and has to suffer a lot of rape threats.Still, the action is pretty good, even if I was sometimes unclear as to what was going on, and Vin Diesel does the tough guy so well. While the movie lacks the compactness and ingenuity that distinguished Pitch Black, this is a fun popcorn flick.",Riddick
24,FeastMode,my notes,2,25 June 2019,"Pretty boring and terrible throughout. Bad acting, stupid story, very typical, and the action parts and were meh. Couldn't wait for it to finish (1 viewing)",Riddick
25,Robert_duder,Low expectations made this a fun ride for me,7,16 January 2014,"My history with this series is varied. I saw Pitch Black years ago (probably when it first released) and I am fairly certain for whatever reason I never saw The Chronicles of Riddick for one reason or another. I had honestly heard far more bad than good about Riddick. Most people seem to think it wasn't nearly as good as its predecessors so my expectations were significantly lowered. That being said...I had a blast. Is this a great movie? No. It is rife with problems, silliness, campiness, poor special effects but sometimes if a film maker is lucky these qualities can endear itself to fans and it did that for me. The green screening in this film is some of the worst I have ever seen. Some of the battle screens literally look like a play being performed on stage (and not a particularly good play.) So do I sound like I'm trashing the film? Maybe a little. These are the reasons why this could never be considered a ""great"" Sci-fi film. However, the film is simple fun. Riddick is a charismatic killer and anti-hero. The film follows nearly the same plot as Pitch Black and blends horror/sci-fi and action quite successfully. The best parts of the film are the beginning as they show Riddick surviving and adapting to this planet and the last part of the film as they attempt to escape. The middle of the film drags a lot, feels like it has little direction and doesn't feature Riddick hardly at all.Vin Diesel IS Riddick. No one else could be a stone cold killer, sociopath and maniac and make him charismatic and the perfect anti-hero like Diesel. The guy has an undeniable chemistry on screen and he is very good at it. The character is fascinating and while this certainly moves him towards mainstream, he is still a good enough hero to make it interesting. The supporting cast are decent but no one really stands out and a couple of them are really campy. Especially our lone female in the film played by Katee Sackhoff. Her performance borders extreme camp and the constant barrage of sexual innuendos is unbearable. She's a decent action heroine but she's used as eye candy and for ridiculous sexual tension between her and Diesel. Its literally laughable. Jordi Mollà is probably the best ""villain"" in the film and his character definitely gets more depth as the film goes on. He is definitely one of the better supporting characters. Same for Matt Nable who has one of the more interesting characters with a good back story with Riddick and his character seems very bland until the latter part of the movie when he really gets to shine and does well. Dave Bautista certainly fits the style of the film and I liked his character but he gets very little development and is mostly noticeable because of his size and look in the film. Everyone else is fodder essentially for Riddick and the other predators in the film.Simply put the movie is fun. It has very little depth, doesn't try to be an Oscar winner by any stretch of the imagination but if you turn your brain off, sit back and enjoy it then you'll find something to really entertain you. It is good that writer and director David Twohy has done all three of the Riddick movies because he clearly has a handle on the characters and what people want from the series. This might not be the smartest of the trilogy but is a fun sci-fi click. The addition of Riddick heavily CGI'd dog is a point of argument because for one thing the CGI is average at best, and also having a pet humanizes Riddick maybe too much. I knew right away when he befriended this pet that it would serve to create some emotion later on and it did. It strikes something in us to watch a beloved pet and protector meet their demise. For all the bad, there was something good. I enjoyed it plain and simple. Take it for what it is and don't go in with your own set of expectations and have fun with it. Sometimes simple fun can be enjoyable!! 7.5/10",Riddick
26,bowmanblue,A film of three halves?,7,30 July 2014,"Okay, I don't really like doing 'spoilers' in my reviews, but, in the case of 'Riddick' I really can't help it. If you don't know, Riddick is the titular character who first appeared in the low budget sci-fi flick 'Pitch Black.' That movie was such a success that it spawned a big-budget sequel 'The Chronicles of Riddick,' which, for some reason, didn't seem to do so well.The problem with the third instalment is... (and here come the spoilers) that it's approximately 1 hour 53 minutes long. The first thirty minutes consist of Riddick, alone on a barren world, fighting one computer-generated monster after the next. Hardly much story there. Then we see two separate spaceship descend on the planet, containing two lots of bounty hunters. And, for practically an hour, we barely see Riddick. Instead, the film turns into some sort of sci0fi 'slasher' film where Riddick stalks and eliminates these baddies one by one. Only, we know it's Riddick killing these people and we don't really care anyway as they're all pretty much horrible people. It's only in the last half hour do things pick up (I won't spoil it any more by saying how). It's fair to say that I enjoyed the last half an hour, but it seemed like I had to wait an awful long time before I go to a bit that I really liked.Basically, this is just 'Pitch Black' again, but with different characters and a different setting. If you really enjoy the Riddick universe then you should like this. I enjoyed it really, however, I was hoping it would be better (or just different) to how it turned out. That said, if ever 'Riddick 4' is made, I'll be there to watch it, too.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Riddick

The first sequel for Riddick had a terrible script but this movie gets back to the monsters in the dark.Riddick is on a planet where monsters that look like rip offs from the alien franchise, come out and about when it rains. He's been living alone but finally tracked down by bounty hunters. Of course they claim to take his head back in a box, but we know that isn't going to happen. And at the end, just like in Pitch Black, we get an adrenaline rush dodging the monsters to get back to the ship.FINAL VERDICT: It's OK for what it is, a mindless sequel and has a few bloody scenes, but not that much. I think it could have used a few more crazy deaths besides the ole kick a hatchet through the neck trick.",Riddick
28,g-bodyl,The Return of Riddick!,8,4 December 2014,"Now I wasn't one of those fanboys who was clamoring for a sequel to this decent sci-fi/horror series, but I was pleasantly surprised at the third installment of this franchise, the aptly-named Riddick. It brings back the R-rating as we get ourselves perhaps a newer retread of Pitch Black, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I feel this film was more fleshened out that the 2000 film. We got ourselves some nice creatures to look at, thanks to the creature design. I could actually dig these monsters resembling an offspring from the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and the aliens from Alien.David Twohy returns as director and in this film, Riddick is left on a deserted planet to die. Knowing he will bring a horde of bounty hunters, Riddick sends a flare requesting help. Once they arrive and are aware of his intentions, they must gang up as they face a force more serious than each other.Vin Diesel makes a welcome return as the antihero, Riddick. We learn how he uses his animal instincts to survive on a deadly planet, and I particularly liked how he turned one of the jackals into a loyal pet of his. Jordi Molla, most known for his role as the villain in Bad Boys 2, is good as Diesel's main enemy. Dave Bautista has some stand-out scenes as one of the henchmen. However, I wish Karl Urban had more screen-time, especially given the fact he is an excellent actor.Overall, Riddick is an enjoyable film even if it feels like a rehashed version of Pitch Black. It's a tad better than Pitch Black and on par with Chronicles of Riddick. I was surprised we were getting a sequel, but as an entertaining sci-fi film, I am more than happy. With these creature designs, plenty of action, and Vin Diesel giving bounty hunters hell, this makes for a good film. I rate this film 8/10.",Riddick
29,A_Different_Drummer,"Fanboys only, a spectacular disappointment",2,19 October 2013,"Ground rules first. You need to know that Pitch Black, the first in the trilogy, was not merely a good sci-fi flick but in fact one of the best of all time. It was near flawless. That it made Diesel a star and spawned the Riddick series was not the original intention. However, as they say, you eat what you have, not what you want. You also need to know that the second in the series, Chronicles, was so good that it transcended its genre and could rank as one of the best action films ever done. It is astonishing. Ground rules now established, Twohy, the creator of the trilogy, decided to return to his roots and the newest entry, oddly named Riddick, is more of the mood of Pitch Black, but lacking the originality, the surprise, and the excitement. I kid you not. There are entire scenes where the Riddick character ""predicts"" what will happen before it does. Great for fanboys. But film historians of the future will not be as kind.",Riddick
30,cosmo_tiger,If you are a fan of this series you will really enjoy this. To me it was nothing but a remake of Pitch Black with a bigger budget,5,11 January 2014,"""There are bad days and there are legendary bad days. This is shaping up to be one of those."" After being betrayed by the Necromongers, Riddick (Diesel) is left for dead. Alone on a remote desolate planet he is forced to regain his instincts and survive the harsh landscape. When he notices a deadly storm approaching he has no choice but to activate a beacon that draws bounty hunters to him. Now he has to find a way to escape while battling bounty hunters, an alien species and a oncoming deadly storm. First thing I should say is that I'm not a huge fan of this series. I thought Pitch Black was OK but didn't like Chronicles of Riddick. So my expectations for this were pretty low going in. Even with low expectations I wasn't impressed by this movie. The beginning was very slow movie and Vin Diesel doesn't have the chops to carry a movie where he is the only one it it for longer then 5 minutes so the first 20 was a struggle. Then it turned to the bounty hunters and Vin Diesel pretty much disappeared for awhile. When he returned the movie fell into a straight remake of Pitch Black. A group of mercenaries who want nothing more then to kill Riddick for a reward but realize they need his help with the aliens and storm. Dialog is awful and the movie could have been a half hour long and lost nothing. On the other hand, if you are a fan of this series you will really enjoy this more then I did. Overall, nothing but a remake of Pitch Black with a bigger budget, I give this a C+.",Riddick
31,Platypuschow,Riddick: Crippled by one poorly chosen scene,6,26 October 2018,"I've been unimpressed by the Riddick franchise, I think Pitch Black (2000) was both where it started and it peaked.This final entry was rather a surprise, who'd have thought that they'd have made another movie considering how badly Chronicles of Riddick (2004) bombed? Partially funded by Diesel himself it's hard to argue his commitment to the project.So almost a decade after the last full entry (Not including the animations) we pick up where we left off. Riddick is Grand Marshall of the Necromongers but things quickly go south after they turn on him and leave him for dead.The plot is actually sound as is the general creation of the movie. I found myself impressed which I certainly didn't expect. The movie is more akin with Pitch Black than Chronicles of Riddick, they clearly went back to the drawing board and the movie is considerably better for it.On a budget out about quarter of the previous movie it's shocking just how much better it all looks, in fact every aspect is superior. Also starring the excellent Katee Sackhoff I was gripped more than I had been since the first movie, it was really quite enjoyable.Fairly early on however I was hoping that a certain death wouldn't occur, I knew if it did then the movie would be damaged beyond repair and about halfway through my fear materialised. Had this event not transpired you'd have me just ranting about how much of a wonderful surprise Riddick was and how much I enjoyed it. Instead I'll say it's the second best movie in the franchise, but should have been the best. Poor decision making killed the film and has left it merely passable.Good addition despite the hefty flaw.The Good:Katee SackhoffLooks considerably better than the previous film which had 4 times the budgetWell played out storyThe Bad:""That"" death should not have happenedSets up for a sequel that will never comeThings I Learnt From This Movie:Even in the future on other planets people are stupid enough to smoke",Riddick
32,The-Sarkologist,More Riddick Madness,8,10 May 2020,"Well, it seemed that the film makers decided to go back to what made the Riddick movies successful, and that is namely Riddick being stuck on an alien planet with a bunch of people who initially are trying to hunt him down, which quickly turns into a fight for survival. Honestly, I don't want to give too much away because there are some major spoilers, but what I can say is that this film is much more like Pitch Black than was the previous film,Riddick had been left stranded on a planet by one of the Necromongers, namely because he has been attempting to find his homeworld. It seems as if being the Lord Marshal of the Necromongers wasn't something that he really wanted to do, and despite him being Riddick, even he wasn't able to deal with the political machinations that come about to people in high command. I guess that is sort of why he really didn't want to continue in the role - he is a loner, not a commander.
Well, the film starts off with him being left for dead, but of course, being Riddick, he does manage to build up his strength again, and he begins to look for a way off the planet, but when he sees a rainstorm coming, something sort of triggers his desire to get off sooner rather than later. Mind you, he does end up being correct. Anyway, he uses an emergency beacon, which summons a bunch of mercenaries, namely because Riddick is still wanted, and there is a very large price on his head.In part this film sort of reminded me of the difference between Alien and Aliens. The first one had an unarmed crew having to deal with an alien, where as the second one had a fully armed combat unit having to deal with them. However, that is probably where the similarities end because in the first film it wasn't a single creature, it was a lot of them.Yet, there were a lot of similarities with the first film, but that is probably because what the filmmakers were doing was attempting to return to what made the first film so good, but adding enough differences to make it appear to be a unique film in and of itself. Well, in my opinion is certainly did work, and it was definitely one of those films that kept you gripped to your seat right through to the end. Mind you, Riddick makes no effort to hide the fact that he knows what is going to happen, but he doesn't reveal anything so that we are eventually blindsided, though I do suspect that one can sort of work out what is eventually going to happen, namely because there are enough hints to help you work it out.Yeah, it turned out that this film was pretty good actually, and it is a bit of a shame that I did miss it in the cinemas, but I have now finally watched it, and I have to say that I really did enjoy it. Sure, it might not be on the level of the first film, but it still holds up, much better than the second film in fact.",Riddick

34,Reno-Rangan,Very close to the first and entertaining,7,13 January 2014,"The first movie was very simple, about surviving in an unknown planet by avoiding the attacks of the alien creatures. But the second movie was totally different with broad in story expansion about humans and human like creature's invasion of different planets of the universe. So this third Riddick movie was very much similar to the first which had very lesser characters. If you ever liked the first, probably you will like this as well.You keep what you kill, so Riddick becomes the new Lord Marshall of the Necromonger. But he's far more away from their faith, so he makes a deal with the commander Vaako. But the deal goes wrong when he was escorted to a wrong planet. Once again, Riddick finds the threats from alien animals from the planet where he is stranded. On the other side, the bounty hunters trouble him, but he must fight to get one of their ships to sail to the planet Furya. Would he succeed or not is the story briefs in the remains.As the per the entertainment prospect this movie was very good. It had great stunts and graphics. As usual the Vin diesel was breathtaking as Riddick. But if you are expecting a story to continue from where the second installment ended you will be sadden. Actually the story follows from the second, but the theme flips back to similar to the first. For me it was a well made movie in the series to fit in and as the third. Those who are disappointed will be brightened up in the next follow up movie for sure. So I believe it is not for everyone, except those who seek a good entertainment.",Riddick
35,Floated2,Decent for what it is,6,16 August 2017,"Riddick is the supposed sequel to The Chronicles of Riddick (2004), recurring writer-director David Twohy and star Vin Diesel get back to basics with Riddick, all but ignoring the events of Chronicles to make the film much more in the spirit of the original Riddick adventure, the low budget Pitch Black (2000). But maybe too much in that spirit, as the new movie at times plays almost like a remake of the earlier one.Similar to Pitch Black, Riddick tells a lean, self-contained story aside from a couple references to characters and events of the previous films — characters and events that. This third film of the franchise is quite easily better than Chronicles as it is due to its R-rating and it feels more authentic and less cartoonish. Though Chronicles was rated PG-13 it made the most from the box office. At times, this film feels quite off and boring and most of the scenes are the ones with Vin Diesel off screen, as they spend a lot of time in the second half building the side characters. Problem is, we mostly do not care for them. Riddick is a decent action film but nothing too special .",Riddick
36,leonblackwood,Could have been better! 5/10,5,18 January 2014,"Review: After waiting years for this movie, I wasn't that impressed with it. The acting was terrible and the storyline was a bit weak. Some of the CGi looked awful, especially the speed bike scene, and the script could have done with a lot of work. From the beginning of the film, was wasn't actually that bad, because the director focused on Riddick, but as soon as the bounty killers started to get involved, it just went straight downhill. It lacked the intensity of the 2nd movie which had a much better storyline, and the Z class actors really didn't help. Some of the action scenes aren't that bad, but it's nothing too amazing. Vin Diesel himself didn't do a bad job, but his lines were corny and some of the fighting scenes with the monsters were totally unrealistic and bloody ridiculous. At the end of the day, the only thing that makes it watchable is the fact that it is Vin Diesel playing Riddick, but as a individual movie, it's not really that good. Watchable!Round-Up: With such a big budget, they could have done so much more with the money. I think that most people went to see this movie because the 2nd one was quite good, but they really let the franchise down with this one. Vin Diesel seems to mumble his way through the movie and he must have the worst luck in the world because he has monster and humans against him from the get go. Apart from that, it is what you expect from a Riddick movie. The dog was a sweet add-on, although it looked dead ugly, but the pumped up bounty killers were bloody useless. I expected better from Vin Diesel, after seeing that he actually produced the movie.Budget: $38million Worldwide Gross: $98millionI recommend this movie to people who are into the Riddick franchise, but it's not the best one in the trilogy. 5/10",Riddick
37,Tweetienator,Another Furious Tale,7,2 October 2020,"Why the Riddick movies are not a greater success as those Fast 'n' Furios movies will be a mystery to me. Hopefully, Mr. Vin Diesel will give us some more adventures of that bad ass Furyan ueber-warrior.

39,arfdawg-1,Blah,3,29 April 2014,"The infamous Riddick has been left for dead on a sun-scorched planet that appears to be lifeless. Soon, however, he finds himself fighting for survival against alien predators more lethal than any human he's encountered. The only way off is for Riddick to activate an emergency beacon and alert mercenaries who rapidly descend to the planet in search of their bounty. The first ship to arrive carries a new breed of merc, more lethal and violent, while the second is captained by a man whose pursuit of Riddick is more personal. With time running out and a storm on the horizon that no one could survive, his hunters won't leave the planet without Riddick's head as their trophy.I really wanted to like this movie. It's just under 2 hours long and there is a lot of filler. There's also a lot of style for style sake. Posing. It gets old fast.About a third into the film the mercenaries get involved and the dialog is ridiculous.Unfortunate.",Riddick
40,Vartiainen,"Lacks vision, but pretty good action/horror piece nonetheless",5,18 January 2014,"And yet again the story of Richard B. Riddick continues. Vin Diesel hasn't grown bored of the character, and I don't see why he should have. Riddick isn't the most original of badasses, but a badass he most definitely is, which is often more than enough to fill a couple of hours with blazing action scenes, violence and testosterone-filled teenage fantasies. Likewise in this case.Riddick is the third movie in the saga and with it the franchise gets down to basics. Nothing more than the badass, a desert planet and a bunch of bounty hunters to slaughter. Some would call it a bit too simplistic, but I actually found it to be refreshingly direct. We don't really want to see nothing more than Riddick slaughtering ""bad guys"" and looking like a total boss while doing it. And that's what we get.This is a film that does its job. It continues the story of Riddick, it delivers high-octane action scenes, it looks nice (if you can deal with a very limited colour palate, that is) and Vin Diesel is a good action star. With proper expectations, this is a good action piece for the evening. Just don't go in looking for something life-altering.",Riddick

Not a film you have to take seriously, just to sit back and be entertained. The effects are pretty descent, and the action is perfectly put together. Vin Diesel is always fun as the anti hero Riddick, and the supporting cast do shine, Katee Sachkoff is amusing as the sexy but tough female hunter.

David Twohy is the director and he directed the first two in the series; Pitch Black in 2000 and The Chronicles of Riddick in 2004. When Vin is left for dead on an inhospitable planet, he fights his way through dangerous alien creatures-the deadliest one being a water serpent/scorpion type hybrid-until he stumbles across an abandoned station with an emergency distress beacon. After pressing the button, two ships show up. The first one is a group of bounty hunters including Jordi and Dave and the other one has Matt and Katee on board. Both groups are looking for Vin, but for different reasons; Jordi wants Vin's head in a box and Matt has more of a personal issue with Vin. Vin just wants to get off the planet, using either one of the ships, he doesn't care which one, he isn't picky. There is a lot of violence-Vin prefers using blades over guns-and even a little nudity, including Katee-WooHooo! This movie reminded me more of Pitch Black than the Chronicles in as far as the story and dark atmosphere goes.

Apples need to be compared to apples, and I gave VERTIGO an ""8"" rating because, among other things, it is not close to being the best movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock. NOTORIOUS is WAY better, and even the deeply-flawed PSYCHO is a cut above VERTIGO. On the other hand, RIDDICK is by far the best of the PITCH BLACK trilogy. It is NOT filmed in ""Dark-o-Vision"" (like the first two outings), and it is NOT cluttered by the presence of Actors, such as Dame Judi Dench, who was somehow cast in the middle film. The chicks here in RIDDICK are Proud to take their tops off for showers, just as were the gals in the original STARSHIP TROOPERS flick. Vin Diesel as the character ""Riddick"" is twice as tough and four times as credible as Sylvester Stallone playing ""Rambo."" His purgatory on ""the planet with no name"" features an interesting and internally consistent ecosystem, and is NOT crammed with pretty doodads overwhelming the story, as was the case with AVATAR. So, kudos to Diesel and writer\director David Twohy for making the best PITCH BLACK movie of all time!",Riddick
44,JoeB131,Chronicles of Rehash,6,28 January 2014,"yup, we have Riddick and a bunch of misfits fighting off a group of CGI monsters while fighting amongst themselves. Where have we seen that before.Oh. Wait. We saw that in the Movie Pitch Black.So we join Riddick as he's just been betrayed by his fellow Necromongers, (no, really, we didn't see that coming) and he settles down on the planet trying to get his grove back.Two rival teams of mercs come to find him, one of them led by the father of the guy who was bringing him in for the first movie.I want to add here my big problem is that the Mercs and the Necromongers never seemed like they really belonged in the same universe. This was my complaint with the last movie and it's my complaint with this one.That said, once you get past the set-up, it's really the same movie at the end, with a storm replacing darkness.Oh, and who survives?

45,XweAponX,Someone to put a Crown on my Head - Someone to put a Noose around my Neck,10,20 December 2013,"The first Riddick film was simply a medium budget Sci-Fi terror flick with the twist of having an interesting antihero and a kind of gauntlet that had to be run, but the unique landscape and hammer-head monsters were relatively twisted.But that first Film was enough to give us a name: Richard B Riddick, escaped convict and murderer. Riddick, who is also known as a Pilot, brought two people from that planet, one an Islamic Iman, the other a little girl who wanted to BE Riddick.The next we see these people were on a planet called Helion Prime: a planet that gathers sunlight and shares it with a whole system of planets. But this planet, and possibly all others had been threatened by NECROMONGERS, who, in their quest to find the threshold of Underverse, will convert you- or kill you.There was a day and night difference between these two installments of this Chronicle: but not that one was great and the other not, no... one was straight terror and the other a magical, beautiful story of future religions, where a planet full of a tolerant population, where all people accept and participate in the faiths of everyone else- is threatened by a militant, intolerant religion. Ironically, Helion would have accepted their religion with open heart, this is what happens when the followers of one religion think that they are so right that there is no room for any other religion.I suppose, there was terror in the second movie too with this militant religion led by Colm Feore (The Lord Marshall) with his sidekick ""Lord Vaako"".The Necromongers had a solution for the people that would not be converted: they would not just kill them they would utterly destroy their planets.""We all began as something else""The Chronicles of Riddick explored Richard B Riddick's ""Furyan"" heritage- The Furyan world, populated by people who had eyes just like Riddick's- and when the Necromongers came, they destroyed everybody killing babies ""with their own birth cords""- This is referenced in Pitch Black when Riddick says, he was found as an infant in a trash bin outside of a Liquor Store with his Umbilical Cord around his neck- And it is referenced in Chronicles of Riddick, by Iman who was quoting Aereon (Judi Dench).So this is the Riddick that we last saw- He killed the Lord Marshall and he ""kept what he killed""-The Riddick is now the leader of a religion that he hates.This movie is a clever mix of the first two: there is is the terror element, and there is also the magical element of the Necromongers. We are shown a little bit of what happened after Riddick became the Lord Marshall, apparently they were none too pleased with his leadership.Riddick reflects on this as he heals his injuries after being stranded on this waste planet. But it's a new planet with its own ecology, animals, and creatures: some of them dangerous- and it all comes in with the storm.In order to trick himself a way off the planet he sets off a mercenary beacon, and that is when the fun begins as two Merc ships show up and start competing as to who is going to put Riddick's head into a box.But not all is as it seems one of the Mercs is not really trying to capture Riddick or kill him and bring him in for the Bounty: he just wants the answer to a question that was posed in the first movie. And it is a pretty interesting surprise as to who this person is.As usual we get to see Riddick kill Merc after Merc with all kinds of interesting contraptions, but that is not the point, something bad is going to happen and only Riddick knows: so how does he get them to quit shooting at him and listen to what he has to say?Eventually I came to realize: as much as Riddick hates the Necromonger religion- he believes it, and in the end he knows that Lord Vaako (a cameo by Karl Urban) was actually another man with a straight spine.This film has fulfilled my admiration for this character, and for Vinnie Diesel. And for director David Twohy.""You Keep what you Kill""",Riddick

Replaced here by a gritty, back-to-basics approach that's more in line with the first film, 'Pitch Black'.I've always been indifferent to 'Pitch Black', and had mixed feelings about 'Chronicles', but I enjoyed the heck out of Riddick. 3rd time's a charm.",Riddick
47,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Another wicked awesome chapter in the saga,8,2 August 2016,"Being a huge fan of the two previous Riddick films, I was overjoyed to hear that Vin Diesel would be raiding his own couch for change to save up in order to make this R rated follow up, still helmed by David Twohy. It's reassuring that in a franchise with more than a few haters, Diesel has the passion and ambition for his character to go out of his way in bringing this to fans. Not to mention what a kick ass, gnarly little space yarn it turned out to be. Pitch Black was a claustrophobic horror fest set on a single harsh world, and The Chronicles Of Riddick opened up into a vast galactic space opera. This one reigns it in closer again (partly because of budget, I would imagine) and gets back to the roots established in Pitch Black. After defeating the Necromongers and becoming their King, Riddick is betrayed and sent into exile by the treacherous Lord Vaako (Karl Urban in a brief but memorable reprisal). Cast out into the stars with a ship running low on fuel, he finds himself marooned on a small, deadly planet that's more challenging than any other he has found himself on (and if you remember, he has been to some hellish little nooks in the past). This world is a dry, acrid rock where every form of wildlife seems to be incredibly lethal, and out to get him. The first half of the film is pure genius, and consists of Riddick playing Survivorman with his environment, battling aliens and elements and befriending a small hell-pup type doggo that grows up into a teeth and claw ridden killing machine that is at one point referred to as a 'dingo dango thing'. This is where it's at for the film, and as soon as the more generic second half arrives, the air gets a bit stale, but it's still heaps of fun. After mastering the terrain and ingeniously dispatching a snakelike alien that seems to have wandered right in from Wolfgang Petersen's Enemy Mine (practical effects POWER), he encounters trouble of the human variety, in the form of bounty hunters. Two teams of outlaws have arrived to claim him: the stern Boss Johns (Matt Nable) who has an old bone to pick with Riddick, and the psychotic A-hole Santana (Jordi Molla, who I think of as the Latin Gary Oldman). They bicker a whole bunch on who gets the prize, unknowingly being infiltrated and messed up by the guy before they've barely landed. Katee Sackhoff is nutso awesome as Dahl, a lesbo tough chick who legit has the line ""I don't f*ck guys, but occasionally I f*uck them up."" Soon there's more charming wildlife, this time in droves of shrieking reptilian predators who intend to see each of them, Riddick included, dead. This forces an amusingly unstable team-up from all forces to battle the uglies and escape this godforsaken place. It's giddy sci-fi pulp good times, and benefits from its hard R rating, something which the other two films never had on their side. Diesel was born to play Riddick, the growling teddy bear, and I hope he gets to continue wearing the goggles for more of these movies, indefinitely if possible. A hell of a great time.",Riddick
48,3xHCCH,Getting to Know Riddick More,6,20 September 2013,"As the movie begins, we see Riddick abandoned in a strange planet only inhabited by vicious predatory beasts. His will to survive is strong even in such inhospitable environment. He tames an alien dog to be his companion. Later, mercenaries come and try to take Riddick back with them for bounty. These mercenaries clearly do not know who they are up against.""Riddick"" is already the third of a series that began with ""Pitch Black"" (2000), followed by ""Chronicles of Riddick"" (2004). If ""Riddick"" is the first one of the series you are watching, you will not really appreciate it as well as one who has seen all three. I don't think it stands alone by itself. I believe you should at least see the first film, ""Pitch Black"" to get introduced to this unlikely lead character with the shiny eyes.""Pitch Black"" is a great science fiction film with a great story and awesome special effects. Riddick is a murderer who has special eyes which can see in the dark. He was a passenger of a spacecraft that was forced to crash land on a planet with flying predatory beasts that thrive in the dark. When an eclipse plunges the planet into pitch black darkness and the beasts come out in deadly swarms, the crew needed Riddick's unique abilities to get them out of there.The events of ""Riddick"" happen about 10 years after those in ""Ptich Black."" Basically, ""Riddick"" follows the same progression of story: Riddick on a new planet with violent beasts, Riddick to interact with new human characters, Riddick fights the beasts to get out of the planet. Among the mercenaries who try to capture Riddick are the crazy psychopath Santana and a man with a connection to a character in Riddick's past, Boss Johns. The best scene of the film was that one where Riddick makes good his promise of getting Santana's head in a box. As for Boss Johns, you may not pick up the connection right away if you have not seen ""Pitch Black"" where one of the guys on the ship with Riddick back then was also named Johns.The most interesting facet of ""Riddick"" is with the character development of Riddick in the first act, from a broken man to one who rediscovers his inner animal instinct and confidence to fight and survive. We will get to meet the softer, more human aspect of this ruthless killer. These aspect elevates ""Riddick"" from being a one- dimensional violent sci-fi kill-fest into one of deeper meaning.",Riddick
49,aharmas,Diesel is the man!,7,7 September 2013,"I love previews! If they are good, I will go see the movie in the theatre, but if they are loud and boring... You do the math. ""Riddick"" surprised me because it was even better than the preview, and I couldn't figure out half of the surprises. From the beginning I was really captivated by the way his character shows his strength, adapts, and proves he is a survivor. There is very little doubt that no matter what he has the resources or will find the tools to vanquish his enemies, nature, animals, or even other devious human predators.The first third of the movie is the best, with Riddick learning from its surroundings, fighting a nasty creature that reminds us of the Aliens' monsters because of its nasty disposition, and it is interesting how he shows us how to make a pet out of well, a creature that looks like a dingo that was exposed to too much radiation. For those 20 minutes or so, we can see what a great director can do, and then the humans show up.There is promise here, but it gets derailed quickly when too much time is given to grunting and boasting. I found the Santana character at best annoying and superfluous. There were too many of them, but he just opened his mouth way too much, and for an evil guy he was in the wrong setting. The film keeps going, and we just know there is going to be backstabbing, double crossing, some male bonding, and a wasted female character who looks like she might be an asset but is given little to do here.The audience is going to be happy with the pacing, the look of the film, and some nifty special effects. I was looking forward to more outdoor scenes and less interaction among the boring bounty hunters. The last third almost brings back some of the energy from the opening scenes, as we wonder how in the world Riddick is going to make it out of this mess, and it pays off. You are going to love the choreography of those last fights, and why it is important that we see more than just a quick cut and an expression. We go to the movies to see that dance to the death, and we want to see those millions of dollars that we keep reading about in these big studio movies.Maybe there is another sequel, and they will give us more. After all, this is an interesting character, and the way Diesel plays him, with determination, with just the right amount of physical energy, and still withdrawing enough so there is an aura of mystery, it is engaging. Let's find another challenge, another world full of temperamental and irritable creatures where he can prove his mettle.Thumbs up!!!",Riddick
50,peterp-450-298716,Riddick Who ?,5,6 January 2014,"Never heard of Riddick or seen any of the previous films ? I would recommend to move along an skip it . Briefly I assumed that this was a self-standing SF , not knowing that this was the continuation of two previous movies . Weird, I had never heard of Riddick. For me it was like reading a book written in braille . You can see that there's something , but you can't understand a thing from it. After 20 minutes I had no idea what was actually going on and what Riddick was talking about.I limit myself only to the way the movie looks and ignore the story. It would be unfair to judge the movie on that part. The images of the desolate planet where Riddick ended up ( I suppose it was actually the intention to execute him there), looked quite futuristic and menacing . Only thing what bothered me after a while was the predominant orange color . It looked like a stadium full of supporters from Holland at a World Cup football match . A sea of orange hues . The life threatening species looked stunning in terms of computer animation . Especially the hyena -like desert dogs I found a success and the relation (if you can call it that way) that Riddick had with the puppy was sometimes amusing to see . I found it a pity that it died in the end . The scorpion-like monsters that were in the mud looked convincing in close-up. Only at a distance they looked like rubber-figures.Riddick was a really cool figure who acted like a half-god with those glittering eyes , his apparently invulnerable body and its ability to predict the ending of certain situations . When the bounty hunters land on the planet it all became more interesting for me. Especially the figure Santana was damn well played with his boastful arrogance and condescending view towards others . The result was a few punches, especially from Dahl , on his tanned face . It's always amusing when some annoying person gets a good spanking. The systematic elimination of the bounty hunters was entertaining and the climax was the cut of head from Santana. A nicely timed and filmed moment. I didn't think the ending was such a success and looked more like a scene from "" Alien"" but in a sort of Sahara . Furthermore the hover bikes looked like an updated version from those of "" Looper "" . And the spaceships looked suspicious alike like those that Zod flew in "" Man of Steel "" . Don't know who stole that idea from whom.I wasn't that impressed about the movie ""Riddick"" . The interaction between the bounty hunters on the one hand and the calculated and cold-blooded Riddick on the other hand were positive. I found that Riddick was sometimes an oracle who could feel how things would work out. Perhaps this was a characteristic of the Riddick himself. The biggest drawback was the lack of knowledge of the prehistory . Perhaps a brief summary at the beginning would have been an option.More reviews at meningvanfilmfreak.blogspot.be",Riddick
51,masonsaul,Boring,4,25 December 2018,"Despite a really good performance from Vin Diesel, Riddick is surprisingly boring. The first half is enjoyable and the 2nd half could have been fun but it decides to focus on it's boring one dimensional bounty hunter characters opposed to it's title character, grinding the pacing to a halt. Wasted potential but not an original concept (very similar to Pitch Black).",Riddick
52,davidmvining,Can it be a return to form if it was never really in form to begin with?,7,10 May 2021,"Without the kind of financial success expected from The Chronicles of Riddick, the Riddick franchise seemed dead. Through some negotiation and a cameo in the third Fast and Furious film, Vin Diesel acquired the rights to Riddick from Universal, and he and David Twohy scrounged up the money independently to finance this third entry in the fractured series. You could buy the conceit that Pitch Black was supposed to be akin to The Hobbit in to a Chronicles of Riddick version of The Lord of the Rings, but the second movie so botched the job that the third film couldn't follow the larger canvas set there. The only direction to go now was smaller, to return Riddick back to his roots and come up with a similar story to the one that audience's held any affection for. That decision might have been due to an unfortunate series of events, but it seems to have been the right choice for Riddick finally finds the right balance of storytelling to actually tell an interesting genre tale. Finally, this series has a pretty good movie in it.Dealing with Riddick's place as Lord Marshall of the Necromongers in what essentially amounts to a prologue, Riddick was the victim of palace intrigue that capitalized on his desire to discover his home planet of Furya. Taken to a remote, desolate planet, Riddick was betrayed and left for dead, and suddenly the character of Richard B. Riddick is (gasp) interesting for literally the first time in the entire franchise. Near death, the first half hour of the film is Riddick learning to survive on an alien, dangerous world. He survives a small pack of alien dogs, adopting one. He has to face a new creature that lives in the only water supply, adapting to its poison before fighting them. It's a largely wordless extended sequence that shows why Riddick is so awesome in a tangible way. This is probably the best this franchise ever got.Riddick and his adopted dog traverse across the surface for some time (long enough for the puppy to become full grown, so who knows how long) until they find an abandoned merc camp. It's when he sees an incoming storm that he knows will bring the dangerous creatures in large number that Riddick kicks off the emergency beacon that scans his face and lets the universe know that this wanted man is alive in a specific place.Already you can see the mirror of events in Pitch Black with the horde of scary creatures and their impending dark environment that will bring them in greater number. This really is a return to Riddick's roots, and it far more effectively uses Riddick than in Pitch Black. Riddick being the quarry of two mercenary groups with different motives for wanting to chase him down is a quality scenario. That we actually got thirty minutes building up Riddick's badassery is a welcome change and a very good starting block. Far too much in this series up to this point has Riddick's awesomeness been just assumed by the filmmakers, negating a lot of the effect of the films' senses of danger. Here, the work actually enhances that sense and makes the middle section a whole lot more fun that it otherwise would be.Now, the two merc groups having completely different motives is really interesting. The first, led by a man named Santana, is a ragtag group of mercs who all look, sound, and act different, most prominently Dave Bautista's Diaz. The second is led by Johns, the father of Johns from the first film, and they wear matching armor and are all far more professional, the most prominent follower of whom is Katee Sackhoff's Dahl (a female character named ""Doll"", interesting choice). Santana wants Riddick for the money, and Johns wants Riddick not so much for revenge but simply for the knowledge of what happened to his son on that backwoods planet. Johns and Riddick end up mirroring each other, both needing to deal with their past in different ways, providing an interesting connection that extends slightly deeper than simply Riddick was around when Johns Junior died.Riddick being the dangerous quarry, he sets a series of traps when the mercs deny him his demand that they leave one ship for him. The middle section ends up being a game Riddick is in control of, but told from the mercs' perspective, turning Riddick into a monster just on the edge of the frame. Actually giving us Riddick becoming awesome in the first act pays off here by making Riddick feel dangerous even when he's off screen.The third act is a repeat of Pitch Black with Riddick leading a small team out into the monster filled rain in search of a pair of glowing items to power the ships, and then return back. What makes it different is the relationship between Johns and Riddick. It pays off well here, though the film's relative uninterest of exploring the relationship to any real depth, essentially creating it and doing little else, prevents it from giving the final act the kind of emotional weight it could have had. It's fine, providing genre thrills with strong CGI monsters and enough character work done before to help the audience invest in the action.It's a solidly good space fantasy thriller, the height of the franchise up to this point, taking the concept of the first film and actually delivering on it in a complete package. It's not great entertainment, but if Diesel and Twohy can somehow manage to get another film made (eight years on and nothing but a script, apparently, so doubtful) then Riddick could end up on a solid narrative course in the future. I'm not holding my breath, but I'd happily check it out should it come to pass.",Riddick
53,p-stepien,Over the Underverse,7,12 September 2013,"The general consensus has ""Pitch Black"" as a surprise classic sci-fi movie, arguably the best ""Alien""-inspired survival horror out there (of course apart from the sleazy Nostromo original), largely owed to the surprising anti-hero Riddick (Vin Diesel in his most defining role), who introduces a riveting twisted morality into the backdrop of deadly predators. The follow-up ""Chronicles of Riddick"" was a ridiculous misstep by both Twohy and Diesel, which expanded the universe mythology into Star Wars exaggerated epicness, a far cry from the blood and grit of the original character. Given the end result was a bombastic failure, it came as no surprise that the movie bombed and the future of further Riddick stories became questionable.Nonetheless Vin Diesel physically came to rescue the franchise, apparently self-aware enough to recognise the impact of Riddick on his career, thus striving to reignite the concept character and forward the story with the aide of David Twohy. The story itself suggests a sense of remorse from its creators for the dreadful sequel, as Riddick narrates that he needs to regress, become more primitive to recapture, what makes him such a deadly adversary and intriguing protagonist. With what is a pretty blatant self-criticism in the form of breaking the fourth wall, Riddick reboots himself by dropping the ludicrous concept of being crowned king of the Necromongers (thankfully quickly and efficiently disposed from the plot within a matter of minutes) and returning to the survivalist core of what made ""Pitch Black"" such a memorable hit.Still not all is right in the new movie, as it is evidently structured around three separate arches, each one decreasingly successful as far as narrative is concerned. Much like in movies such as ""I Am Legend"" the film works best, when Riddick is left for dead on a secluded and deadly planet, with only his instincts and years of experience left to survive on the carnivorous planet. At first broken and bruised the flirt with death is a gruesome toil, but slowly Riddick takes a stranglehold on his fate, not allowing the brutality of the world to become his demise.The second act also works pretty well, when Riddick becomes aware of an incoming storm that brings with it a deadly scourge. Thus he is forced to send out a distress call into the quadrant, which quickly has bounty hunters scavenge for his head (as he is worth more dead than alive). When two ships appear at the site, the question quickly arises as to who is truly the hunted and who is the hunter in this dance with death. Focus shifts away from Riddick and towards the band of mercenaries, who slowly come to accept that their trophy may result in their untimely death. At times filled with tension, the setting works nicely, especially given the despicable presence of Santana (Jordi Mollà) and the boisterous Diaz (Dave Bautista) to amp up proceedings.After such a nicely structured setup, ""Riddick"" does unfortunately drop off with the culmination - as the menace hidden in the storm descends upon Riddick and the survivors, bringing a rushed rehash of the ""Pitch Black"" story (with somewhat reduxed opponents), but without the tension, colourful interaction and grit. Riddick on the one hand is presented as the only one, who can save the remaining mercenaries, but ultimately the character hardly has anything to brag about. The bounty hunters easily hold their own, while Riddick takes a back seat, only to falter close to the end. Were Riddick's downfall to serve as an instrument for further formation of the character, maybe it could have worked (Riddick realising he is not indestructible and infallible, accepting some weaknesses or being unable to cope with it), but instead it serves solely as an self-serving instrument for a cheeky ending. After this ordeal Riddick remains as condescending and brutishly confident as always, hence no character shift or impact.Both Vin Diesel and director David Twohy clearly enjoy the character they formed together, one of the rare few iconic heroes in movie lore of the current age of filmmaking, one so perfectly fit for Diesel's brash voice and masculinity. The on-screen testosterone is clearly old school 1980s, but the execution is modern with some of the best special effects of the summer, created for what must be considered a minuscule budget. All in all ""Riddick"" definitely doesn't hurt the franchise, instead recuperates after a slightly ridiculous sequel and reinvigorates it for future outings, possibly this time around having him venture back to his homeland: Furya.",Riddick
54,Rob_Taylor,Difficult to review adequately.,8,19 December 2013,"I say that because on the one hand, Riddick is basically a variation on Pitch Black, with many similar scenes and dialogue moments. On the other, it is undeniably enjoyable enough that it makes you forget about that fact.For me, enjoyment is the key to overlooking a lot of sins. If the movie sucks me in and takes me away, it can commit horrible movie atrocities and I'll let it get away with it.Riddick does this. It helps, of course, that the main character is the most entertaining and enjoyable scifi creation since Ellen Ripley first popped out of a cryo pod. Riddick is, or perhaps I should say, was, the ultimate anti-hero. Giving not one damn about anyone else, he ploughs through anything that gets in his way with a kind of gleeful sociopathy that you can't help but like.Then there are the monsters. Imaginative and well realised, if ultimately no match for our hero. I won't say the setting for them is original. Creatures that can only stray from water when it rains is a well-trodden path (The Legacy of Heorot by Larry Niven featured a similar set of beasties) but it is a first for cinema.The bad guys are wonderfully over-the-top and enjoyably mean. There is even the goofiest early-warning system you'll ever see in a movie.In short, it's just fun. Which allows you to overlooking the less fun parts, which I shall now list below.Riddick isn't consistent. He gives a monologue near the start,bemoaning the fact that he's lost his ""edge"" and stating that he will get it back.What is the first thing he does to revive the old, animalistic, Riddick? He gets a puppy! No, I'm serious! He gets a li'l poochie! Hardly the edgy character. He even treats it like a pet. I'll admit, there was a bit of a Scooby and Shaggy thing going for awhile.The other main concern was the similarities between this movie and Pitch Black. Similar dialogue and scenes - Riddick sitting on top of the space ship whilst the owners look everywhere else for him - Riddick being chained up and getting loose - Riddick spying on the female character like a perv. All kinds of similarities.But, as I mentioned, it is still fun! Which is why this is a hard film to rate. Derivative and unimaginitive it might be, but it has plenty of energy once it gets going. It never quite manages to recapture the awesomeness of Pitch Black, but it tries.SUMMARY: Nothing original. Wisely does away with the whole ""Necromonger"" plot line early on. Not Riddick at his best, but fun nonetheless.",Riddick
55,moviexclusive,"Exactly the 'Pitch Black' sequel fans would love, Vin Diesel's third outing as the intergalactic anti-hero is pulpy, gory and a whole lot of violent fun",7,6 September 2013,"Since 'The Chronicles of Riddick' was such a critical and commercial disappointment, it only seems logical that franchise helmer David Twohy would adopt a back-to-basics approach with this sequel. Indeed, right down to its pared down title, this titular intergalactic anti-hero's third big-screen outing forgoes the overwrought politics that made its predecessor such a bloated and ill-conceived mess and instead opts for the stripped down intensity of 'Pitch Black', pitting the escaped convict once again against both aliens and humans in a sun-scorched desolate planet.Opening with a near-wordless sequence with only Vin Diesel's trademark basso-voice occasionally punctuating the cries of the wild beasts, the first half-hour is an instant riveting grabber; and as Riddick orientates himself to his new surroundings, we too are acquainted with the dangers that surround - the winged pterodactyls, the dingoes with razor-sharp teeth, and most memorably the giant slithering scorpion-like denizens of the swamps. Besides the elemental man-versus-nature struggle, we are also treated to some gorgeous otherworldly vistas - not unlike that of the planet with three suns that Riddick was first marooned on in 'Pitch Black'.Except for a brief filler to provide continuity with the events in ""Chronicles"", this is otherwise a highly focused, edge-of-your-seat gripping introduction that fans will love. Yes, in that flashback, those who sat through the last movie and came back for this will be familiar with the Necromongers (including a certain Commander Vakko, whom Karl Urban reprises in a cameo) Riddick had last been seen fighting against, and for whom earning the title of Lord Marshal is not enough to stop from being double-crossed and left for dead on a planet identified only as ""not Furya"". Not that one needs to bother - even Riddick acknowledges that ""somewhere along the way I lost a step gotta find that animal side again.""And so Twohy treats us to plenty of that here, as Riddick fashions his homemade weapons to deal with the unfriendly fauna standing in between him and survival. Yet, Riddick hasn't gone all cold and callous - in fact, this Riddick seems even more human than his earlier iterations. Not only does he seem more vulnerable (his face and body bearing some clearly grievous wounds from being double-crossed), he also shows off a heretofore unseen more playful side through his domestication of a wild dingo he raises from young. The fact that Riddick's newfound levity in no way diminishes his bad-assness is a sign of the assurance both Twohy and Diesel have in the character this third time round, leaving utterly no doubt that Riddick owns the movie.It is precisely because the movie rests so heavily on Riddick's shoulders that the middle section actually sags. Activating a distress signal on an abandoned station, Riddick summons two groups of bounty hunters after his head - the first led by an over-the-top Jordi Mollà's Santana and the second by a stony Boss Johns (Matt Nable). The equivalent of 'cock-blocking' ensues, with Santana eager to shut Johns out and claim Riddick as his prize - until of course he finds himself predictably outwitted by Riddick, and thereafter reluctantly agree to work on Johns' terms. Unfortunately, even with Katee Sackhoff's kick-ass female character Dahl, the ego posturing gets tiring after a while - especially since Riddick gets pushed to the periphery for far longer than necessary.That said, Twohy here aims for the cheesy cornball sci-fi flicks of the 80s and early 90s, and in that regard, he succeeds in injecting the movie with pulpy fun - thanks to some choice lines by tough babe Dahl and the utter incompetence of Santana and his crew. This is the kind of movie where Dahl asserts her lesbianism with a line like ""I don't f**k guys. Occasionally, I f**k them up if they need it"" and Santana gets to trash-talk with homophobic insults and rape jokes before getting his butt kicked by Dahl; it is also that kind of movie where most of the ""mercs"" are disposable and the one that stands out (i.e. Santana) is prepped for a particularly gleeful comeuppance.Rest assured he does his, in a jaw-dropping bit that makes delightful use of a machete, a box and half a severed head. In a nice nod to 'Pitch Black', it is a storm that unleashes the darkness in which all hell breaks loose, setting in motion a climax of non-stop exhilaration as the bounty hunters are forced to rely on Riddick to get off the planet. If there was any doubt that Twohy could return the franchise back to the R- rated thrills of the first movie, then this extended finale should firmly put those worries to rest; in fact, we're willing to guarantee that you'll find yourself cheering at the way Riddick outwits, outplays and outlasts his enemies in exuberantly gory fashion.You have to hand it to Twohy - after somewhat losing his way following an obviously studio-driven sequel, he once again restores credibility to the cult status of Richard B. Riddick, arguably the genesis in the kind of modern cinematic masculinity that Vin Diesel has continually built on through roles in 'Fast and Furious' and 'xXx'. By returning Riddick to a story more akin in structure and style to 'Pitch Black', Twohy also does a successful reboot that puts R-rated fun back into the sci-fi genre. And even more if you have been a fan of 'Pitch Black', this back to genre basics tale of Riddick's quest for survival is exactly the sort of sequel you have waited 13 years to be made.",Riddick
56,quincytheodore,Return to Pitch Black,7,11 September 2013,"In a throwback to Pitch Black lore, Riddick regains some of its sci-fi tension and although is not as incredibly colossal as some action movie recently, it's a decent action thrill with proved traditional approach. Once again Riddick finds himself in a strange realm chased by hunters, both humans and beasts. The premise is set so similarly after Pitch Black, down to some of its stereotypical characters, I couldn't help the surging feel of deja vu as I watched it. The simpler theme, for most and better part, works well for dark action Riddick is known for.Vin Diesel returns to his old fugitive character after a while, it's a good direction not to portray Riddick as constantly overwhelmingly hero. He's vulnerable at some points and relies on his predatory stealth skill instead of sheer brute force. The highlights of the movie is when he tinkers with the mercenaries and outwits them with trickery. He is presentable as hazard to other human beings and built like the part as well. However, the acting might stumble a bit as Riddick barely registers emotion aside from taunting grin or low pitch grunt.As for the incoming threat of monsters, it may be hit-and-miss. These creatures don't have the presence of the old photophobia beasts from Pitch Black, and appearance-wise a bit too generic. CG for them is acceptable, especially for the space dog for Riddick's companion. Action goes smoothly even if there are segments that look awkward. The use of lightning and color dye fit the atmosphere of dry hostile planet, scenes in the dark are meticulously done as they are still coherent and focused. I personally dislike the habit it does with shining the flashlight straight into the audience though.Cast is wildly brash. Most of these characters might be offensive or irritating, as the mercenaries are supposed to, but the script doesn't really help adding personality into them. Everyone is one dimensional as they come, from the erratic merc leader, the more sophisticated merc leader, the usual henchmen merc and one sexy merc. If you have seen the trailer, these people will act as expected as that thirty second shows. For depth and characters, I'd say the original Pitch Black has more likable ones, at the very least more tolerable.Riddick is old school sci-fi action, it doesn't use flamboyant CG and rightly so, since the appeal is the larger than live legend Riddick has. The ending might slightly underwhelming and it is placed in more niche category compared to the recent Pacific Rim or Star Trek, nevertheless it's still an enjoyable foray to the dark realm which its claims victim one at a time.",Riddick

58,Terryfan,"It's a improvement but still lacks in what made Riddick, Riddick",6,21 August 2015,"Riddick is one of the most powerful and dangerous characters ever created. Riddick is just one of those interesting Anti-Heroes.Vin Diesel is the only man who could bring this character to life and he puts his heart and soul into the character.Once Vin Diesel got the rights to Riddick he went to work on making this film.However I have to say I was kind of let down with this film. Mostly because it felt like Pitch Black 1.5 if you compare the two movies together you will see there is more than enough to clearly say they are pretty much close to being the same film just with different cast members.Such as Matt Nable Katee Sackhoff, Jordi Molla, Dave Bautista, Karl Urban and others. The visual setting is what you would expect from Riddick to match the tone of the character and you could always be sure the darkness is where Riddick shines.Also the film feature some creative quotes and good effects which makes the film watchable. But where the film is disappointing is that the fact the film really feels too much like Pitch Black no this is not a Reboot no no no it just feels like Pitch Black Plus the film does get graphic at times so be warn. Being R rated is understandableAnother plus is there is tense moments in the film which is part of the series history and some good acting can be found here in the filmWhile there is something for all Riddick fans it just feels like there is so much more that could have gone into the film but to be fair they at least try to make it a improvement over The Chronicles of Riddick I give Riddick an 6 out of 10",Riddick
59,DJAkin,The best of the trilogy,10,6 September 2013,"This movie was so good. Count Vaako was hardly in this movie but since his character was played by the Star Trek guy, I am not shocked. I was shocked how much I loved it. I was the only person in the entire theater which was a tad strange. Then again, I went at an early showing. This movie shows Riddick on a sun scorched planet. Riddick is pretty much all by himself for most of the beginning part of the movie. He tells his story about how he got there and became very close to a dog that he raised up from the puppy's early years. There were lots of amazing monsters on this planet. Some of them were like scorpions and could kill with their venom which was amazing. There were also fish that Riddick would eat to survive. The main bad guy was Santana who wanted Riddick's head in a box for some reason. This was not just any box but a special box with devices to keep the head alive I presume. Johns was also in the movie and played a guy who wanted answers about his son (the Cole Hauser guy from Pitch Black). Riddick looks pretty much the same as he did in the first movie. There was a lot of great plot in this one though. Riddick is able to be very elusive and he challenges anything that is put to him. He really puts people to the test and when he get's angry, look out! There is no telling if Riddick will make another appearance of if this is the end of the saga. I certainly hope not. The thugs that Santana had were amazingly cruel. They underestimated Riddick though and never saw him coming. There were many times during the first 45 minutes when it was pretty much a movie about Riddick and his new dog and how they bonded. It reminded me of Old Yeller. There was a scene where Santana is attacked by the dog and I will just leave it at that. Congrats Vin, you made another masterpiece. The Computer Generated scenes were amazing and put George Lucas to shame.",Riddick
60,Troy_Campbell,Surprisingly enjoyable,6,13 September 2013,"Similar to Sly's return to action hero status in the last 8 years, the ultra-successful F&F franchise has allowed Vin Diesel to reclaim the clout he once had in Hollywood, both as star and producer. This means we get a belated third outing for futuristic outlaw Riddick – a morally-corrupt protagonist made famous by Diesel in the excellent 2000 film Pitch Black – despite the critically hammered, box-office-flop sequel that was 2004's The Chronicles of Riddick. Don't roll your eyes like I did when I heard of this threequel, it's actually pretty darn enjoyable and certainly a welcome return to form for the cool-as-a-cucumber killer. David Twohy makes his relatively small budget of USD$38m go a long way, with visually intriguing beasts, an apocalyptic landscape and a handful of memorably gory moments all realised with surprisingly strong CGI. The cast is also fairly decent considering the second rate premise they're working with; Diesel gives 100% in a role he clearly cherishes, 'Battlestar Galactica' fan favourite Katee Sackhoff holds her own as the sole female amongst a bunch of rowdy men and Matt Nable anchors the movie as the non-flashy mercenary leader, however Jordi Molla hams it up way too much as a mouthy bounty hunter and Nolan Gerard Funk (you couldn't make that name up) is a complete waste of space as a young bible basher. When it's all over and you have ample time to think back over the film, the sheer stupidity of Twohy's own script - with plot holes galore - becomes evident, but in the moment this trashy sci-fi delivers the b-grade goods.",Riddick

The opening half hour featuring badass in space Vin fighting for survival is a real highlight of the entire movie, with its complete lack of dialogue and inventive looking monsters. The plot itself is generic as they come and very simplistic, so too are the 80's Saturday morning cartoon characters, but the movie's scaled down ambition after the hit and miss ""Chronicles"" works very well here, and any fan of the series, along with sci-fi fans in general, should take at least something away from this decent little movie that was better than I first thought it was going to be.",Riddick

63,Vivekmaru45,Shades Of Pitch Black?,4,14 January 2014,"After Twohy's colossal flop film The Chronicles of Riddick(2004), he decides to recycle elements from his earlier two films: Pitch Black(2000) and Chronicles Of Riddick into a third film called Riddick.The films continues immediately after the events in Chronicles Of Riddick. Riddick, who is the new leader of the Necromongers wants to desperately leave this sect and so he strikes a deal with Commander Vaako; the location of Furya and a ship to take him there, in exchange for Vaako becoming the next Lord Marshall. Led by Vaako's aide, Krone, Riddick and a group of Necromongers arrive on a desolate planet. Recognizing it is not Furya, Riddick kills most of his escort when they attempt to assassinate him. In the chaos, Krone causes a landslide and buries Riddick alive. Emerging from the rubble with a fractured leg, Riddick manages to reset and splint his broken leg. His next task is to fend off the hostile predatory creatures that thrive on the planet(similar to Pitch Black), try to survive and find a way off the planet.We then see some Bounty Hunters arrive on the planet. The leader in particular wants to collect Riddick's Head in a box. Soon another ship arrives, which consists of Mercenaries lead by Boss Johns. So the hunt is on for Riddick. Will he survive and get off this planet? You will have to see for yourself what happens next.The film consists of C.G.I. special effects which have become the staple of Hollywood films. Photography is decent and sound effects are what you'd expect in a film of this genre. The main problem of the film is the predictable and boring plot of the film. Really if you think about it, Chronicles Of Riddick is even better than this film. The alien creature in the film seem to have been influenced by H.R. Giger's Alien creature design.Even Diesel's acting prowess doesn't lift the film above its average quality.Conclusion: rent it and watch it. If you like it then you can watch it on the big-screen cinema in 3D. I give this film an average rating of 4.",Riddick
64,ersinkdotcom,Not the sequel people wanted from this franchise,6,29 January 2014,"After nearly a 10 year gap between films, many were wondering if we really needed a sequel to ""The Chronicles of Riddick."" The 2004 follow- up to ""Pitch Black"" veered off from the simple ""fight-to-survive"" scenario and took us into a world overstuffed with CGI razzle dazzle. What would Vin Diesel and Director Dave Twohy do with the third installment in the franchise, simply titled ""Riddick?""What they've done is return the lead character to what he does best. I can't completely say this is a good thing. Riddick is a survivor. Whether you think him to be good or bad, the guy has a way of saving himself while ""accidently"" saving others at the same time. Strange thing is he's always rescuing people he doesn't even care about.Director/Writer David Twohy has found a way to mash together elements of ""Castaway"" and ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" with ""Aliens"" and ""Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation."" In the first part of the film, the title character is banished from the city of the Necromongers. He's making his way solo through the desert fighting off all sorts of alien beasts. The second half has Riddick trapped in an abandoned outpost with a group of mercenaries and bounty hunters while fending off water monsters that have surrounded the motley bunch.The CGI and practical effects in ""Riddick"" aren't so bad. They're a lot easier to stomach than what we were served up in ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug."" The visual effects are scaled way back from what we saw in ""The Chronicles of Riddick.""You can tell Vin Diesel loves the character of Riddick. He fully embraces the role and savors every moment on screen. Katee Sackhoff portrays one of the bounty hunters like she's playing a grimier version of Starbuck from ""Battlestar Galactica.""""Riddick"" is rated R for strong violence, language, and some sexual content/nudity. The only nudity is an extremely brief and very unnecessary shot of Katee Sackhoff in the shower. The rest is just sci- fi gore and bounty hunters cussing like sailors.For the most part, ""Riddick"" gives the viewer a sense of déjà vu. The survivalist beginning of the movie does keep it from completely falling into retread territory. However, I'm still pretty sure it wasn't the sequel people wanted from this franchise. I can't tell you exactly what I wanted from it, but it was something different from this.",Riddick

I love these Riddick﻿ movies, and the character just makes me feel so much less of a human being, because he is just so great. Vin Diesel﻿ really doesn't need to do anything else, I know people get bored of the same thing, but Riddick's Universe is as good as Star Trek's, or Wars' for being a fully realized Universe that can have so many different stories fold out of it. No rush Diesel is young enough, and the effects will just get better. Yes you can tell that for most of this movie they are in a room that itself is in a sound stage. The walls are painted as badly as the OK coral episode of the Original Star Trek, but the story , and acting carry enough of the load that you hardly notice. Great work by all of the actors, and the CG Dog is a nice touch, though a bit Scooby-Doo﻿. Well like I said I like these so you know I Enjoyed this a lot. I think most people will get a good ride out of this movie. It is not a horror, and there is really not that much blood, and the people who die always prove to deserve it(in the movies).",Riddick
67,dfa120374,Thankfully Better Than Chronicles,6,16 January 2015,"Thinking that he was being taken back to his home planet of Furya, Riddick (Vin Diesel) finds that he has been betrayed once again and has been left for dead on a seemingly inhospitable planet. Riddick finds a remote station and while knowing the distress beacon will attract unwelcome guests he sets it off regardless as it may be the only way for him to escape the planet. The beacon attracts two parties of bounty hunters, so now Riddick must not only escape the planet before a deadly swarm of vicious creatures arrive, but he now has to contend with deadly mercenaries, one of which has very personal reasons to hunt Riddick down.I'll start by saying that thankfully Riddick is much better than the disaster that was Chronicles of Riddick and while this film continues on from Chronicles, the story itself follows on more from Pitch Black. There are similarities between the two so I guess that even though there is a story here, it's just not really an original one.With that being said, however, we all knew this was never going to be a movie with an Oscar-winning storyline but where there's a lack of originality, there's a decent amount of action and visuals to make up for it. I liked a good few of the effects, but one I especially liked was the way Riddick's eyes glowed in the dark. Just like in Pitch Black, it's a really nice touch and adds to the overall mood of the scenes where you see this.Some of the acting from a couple of the cast members is pretty suspect, especially from Dave Bautista. He doesn't have that many lines, though, and is really there only for a bit of muscle, so thankfully it isn't enough to ruin what is overall a pretty decent action/sci-fi flick.You don't really have to watch Chronicles - thankfully - to know what's going on in Riddick but I definitely recommend watching this one, especially if you enjoyed Pitch Black.",Riddick
68,DareDevilKid,David Twohy and Vin Diesel Combine for Another Cult-Classic,9,10 September 2013,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4/5 starsDavid Twohy is back to his roots, and thankfully coincides ""Riddick"" with the tone and plot-line of the cult-classic ""Pitch Black"", rather than the overblown and messed up ""The Chronicles of Riddick"". It might have quite a few recurring elements from the series' first installment, but to Twohy's credit, the film also ends up standing on its own as one of those darkly haunting sci-fi tales that's interlaces plenty of action, suspense, and horror, to keep you riveted and guessing till the end. The monsters are scary, well-made, and appear only when required, so that they are used as a major plot device to add a lot of depth to the narrative. The actions is brilliant, but never overdone, and successfully enhances your viewing pleasure instead of numbing your senses (as is the case in most overblown CGI fiascos passing of as sci- fi nowadays).The character of Riddick has already been established as a sardonic, strong, dubious, and enigmatic personality, and here, this dark anti- hero just grows on you with each passing frame. Vin Diesel brings all his star power and macho charisma to the role once again, and reminds you why he's currently one of the world's biggest moviestars. The rest of the cast, especially Katee Sackhoff also do a good job. ""Riddick"" is a treat for hardcore sci-fi fans as well as fans of the franchise, and is sure to remain with you long after leaving the cinema hall.",Riddick
69,RevRonster,Riddick is back...,8,15 January 2014,"I truly believe that Riddick is the best character that Vin Diesel has ever played (yes, better than the Iron Gianteven though he may me cry in that one""Superman"") and he really felt like he was born to play the iconic anti-hero that can see in the dark and kick tail like nobody's business.I've pretty much enjoyed every film, story and video game that has had the character in it and was a little more than excited for this one when I saw the first trailer. For the most part, my expectations were met and I wasn't at all disappointed. The action is great and brutal, Vin Diesel is still awesome and killer as Riddick, the special effects look great, the monsters were cool and some of the new characters (including one who is attached to Riddick's past) are fun and fit in with the established universe Riddick belongs to.Granted, the film is a little shaky when it comes to balancing out its very rigid three Act format for the story and many characters go undeveloped so they can be tally marks for the body count meter; however, this is seen in a lot of action and Sci-Fi films so it wasn't that surprising or distracting to me. Additionally, since I think Riddick is already such an interesting and awesome character, I can overlook these small shortcomings in order to enjoy the man's latest adventure.Hi! My name is Rev.

70,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Dark Rules,8,6 September 2013,"Forget all the backstory and let's start fresh Vin Diesel's RIDDICK has been abandoned on a desert planet where the only creatures are dingo-like, zebra stripped man-eaters on land, while in pools of water live some kind of poisonous tentacle beast that makes the hell hounds seem like butterflies. For Riddick this is only a problem till he figures out how to get past the water-creatures after giving himself, and a tamed land animal he raised from a pup, immunization to survive. And survival is what RIDDICK: RULE THE DARK is all about.If you've seen FIRST BLOOD, where Green Beret Vietnam vet John Rambo is hunted by lawmen way out of their league, you'll remember the line: ""We're not hunting him, he's hunting us."" That's exactly what happens when two groups land on the planet after a contrived distress signal – one a motley crew led by a gruff Spanish bounty hunter; the other an official uniformed team including a stalwart captain and a sexy blond woman tougher than nails. The suspenseful second act, after Riddick learns to survive on a planet literally out to devour him, could be called THE LEGEND OF RIDDICK as we hardly see him at all. He's nervously discussed by the converged party, who wants his head for money, and in the Rambo fashion they're picked off one-by-one especially at night when Riddick has the most power. Despite some Cable-TV special effects and corny muscle-bound dialogue, these are the best scenes: our ghostly hero, appearing in silhouette, wreaks havoc on the same people he'd warned from the onset.But the energetic cat and mouse game morphs into an all-out creature feature as, during a thunderstorm, the formidable water beasts inhabit the entire planet. Eventually our anti-hero has to reluctantly band together with those determined to kill him... here's where most of the action occurs. It's too bad the characters, fleshed out during Riddick's absence, become much-too-easy victims of a menace so large in number you'll wish it never rained in the first or rather the last place. From here a movie that took it's time in the build-up races desperately for a conclusion.",Riddick
71,PyroSikTh,"Enjoyable, but too similar to Pitch Black",7,10 September 2013,"Riddick picks up right where Chronicles left off, sort of. Riddick finds himself on a barren planet being picked on by all sorts of alien wildlife. Once he finds a place to rest we flashback to his time as lord of the Necromungers, and how he found himself here. He's got to build himself back up again and fight to survive. He also makes a friend along the way; a Furyan and his alien puppy. Thankfully his relationship with the puppy is built up very well and you can't help but find it all adorable. We see Riddick at his softest yet without breaking character. That's the whole first act, so I'm not going to lie, it takes a while to get into it. The second act deals with the mercenaries who are there to hunt him. Riddick and his puppy very much take a much more backwards seat, becoming the ghosts in the shadows, while the focus shifts the new array of characters.Unfortunately the trailer I found reasonably misleading and actually fairly spoilery. It carried implications that this would be another story of Riddick and a gang of misfits verses a deadly alien threat lingering in the darkness. That is not the case. The alien threat is only the third act, making it's appearance to create a fitting climax at the end. It's not like it comes out of nowhere though, as it's hinted at fairly early on, and lingers on throughout. The trailer also spoiled the death of a particular character, again with the implication that it occurs fairly early. If it was early on I wouldn't have minded, but it actually happens way into the movie; halfway through the third act.As you might be able to tell, the story shares a lot of similarities with Pitch Black, which used pretty much the same three acts - surviving on an alien planet, Riddick lurking in the shadows, alien threat lingering in the darkness. It works, and is injected with a few refreshing concepts, but it prevents me from praising the plot too much as it's unoriginal, even in the context of the franchise. If anything this is the kind of movie you'd expect to see as the second instalment, as it rides on the coattails of the first. It ties back to the first movie in more than just this, as we're introduced to a merc named Johns. Sound familiar? That's because it's the father of Johns in the first film. It's a nice touch, but I couldn't get behind it. I mean the first Johns looked at least thirty, probably more. This film happens ten years later, and his father just about looks middle- aged. By my count that means he fathered his son when he was between five and ten years old?! I didn't buy it.The visuals were a bit hit and miss, I have to confess. For the most part it was fantastic. The world that was created looked beautifully bleak, and the incoming storm adequately dark and threatening. Also the shuttles and general equipment used also looked as you'd expect, both futuristic and functional. Where it gets hit and miss is with the alien creatures. There's at least four creatures here; flying reptiles, eels, dogs, and strange scorpion-like water-dwellers. All of them were designed brilliantly. They all looked like animals that could actually exist had they evolved on a different planet. The dogs were especially impressive with their large ears to not only hear better, but also keep them cool, and a light, patterned coat to camouflage them against their own predators. The scorpion things were also really well designed, and early on we even got glimpses of how they hunted. Unfortunately by the end they just become a faceless swarm, but it was interesting nonetheless. The miss in this regard comes from how they weren't rendered particularly well. Sometimes they'd bleed into the picture really well, but unfortunately a lot of the time they stuck out like saw thumbs. The most obvious example of this is when Riddick traps his pup in a bone cage. Of course the cage was physically made, but the pup is CGI'd inside and it just looks horrible; so obviously fake, which is unfortunate.It's definitely a movie worthy of franchise, dialling everything back to the basics, although maybe taking a few too many leaves from the first film. The visuals are impressive at times, but lacking at others, but in general it all shows a great attention to the world that's being created. At the end of the day it was a thoroughly enjoyable watch that I wouldn't hesitate to buy on DVD and put on my shelf. That in itself is recommendation enough. I give Riddick a good 7/10.",Riddick
72,Al_The_Strange,Riddick review,8,13 September 2013,"It's been a long thirteen years since Richard B. Riddick made his debut in Pitch Black as the wicked, hardcore serial murderer who would become a hero to a few desperate survivors. Riddick fought monsters again, in the form of a tyrannical empire, in The Chronicles of Riddick. With a couple of decent video games and a cartoon also in Riddick's name, the man has become one of the most popular antiheroes of modern cinema. It's hard not to love how savage and badass he is.It's been a long, barren stretch since 2004's TCoR (one's thirst for Riddick being only a little quenched with the 2009 video game, Assualt on Dark Athena). Finally, this third film continues the chronicle, dumping Riddick back into his element and invoking the brutal, primal forces that made the original Pitch Black so appealing. The film immediately tracks him on some barren, unknown planet; he's wounded, vulnerable, and hunted by all manner of wicked creatures. A few flashbacks provide the necessary bridge between this and the last film, before picking up again with the raw struggle for survival. These scenes are pretty cool as they are, but things gets pretty serious when Riddick activates a beacon that summons mercs to his location. Then, he becomes the dead man stalking. Things get a little stupid and ridiculous from this point on, but it's still pretty awesome to watch Riddick mess up some mercs, both physically and psychologically. The fights are cool, the suspense is gripping, the kills are gruesome and awesome, and the overall tone and atmosphere exudes sheer savagery. This film represents the essence of who Riddick is and what he does best.The story is pretty lightweight and thin, going so far as rehashing the general structure of Pitch Black (they're both films that are split pretty evenly between men fighting men, and then turning around to fight monsters and get the hell off the planet). Most of the characters are pretty flat and borderline unlikable (and mostly pretty stupid), and there are a few parts where they make a sudden change of heart that seems rather unlikely. As the centerpiece, however, Riddick shines through as the biggest strength to the story. From the start, he is presented as a man who lost his edge, rendered soft and weakened after the events of TCoR. The bulk of the film is about him getting his edge back, and with the later turn of events, maybe even finding a little bit of absolution. While most of the movie will come off as pretty average storytelling, I personally applaud it for digging deeper into Riddick's own savagery and immersing us into his dark, primal nature.The film uses decent photography and editing. Some of the action is a little shaky, but thankfully, this film is way more steady and pleasant to watch than the predeceasing Riddick films. Acting from most of the cast is nothing to scream about, but Vin Diesel does show surprising maturity as Riddick; he shows far more expression and vulnerability in this role than he did before, and it does effectively add more dimensionality to the title character. Writing is pretty stupid some times, pretty awesome other times, but all-around kinda bad. This production uses cool-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is pretty decent.Riddick echoes a lot of the same things that made Pitch Black so cool, but I think Riddick is a better, funner, more awesome experience. TCoR is still my favorite of the lot, because it was so epic and cool, but Riddick is a welcome return to form, and I'd be interested to see where the man goes next.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Average | Film: Pretty Good)",Riddick
73,Offworld_Colony,When I first watched this film I was overly critical (0.5 stars!).,5,14 February 2020,"Watching it back, to wind down after a tough day (and a tough previous film!), it was a fun and fairly unique combination of B-movie, tough-guy and sci-fi tropes. Twohy, with a serious attempt at a return-to-form and erasure of previous film's failures, manages to make something reverential of this left-field franchise, and yet also standalone.
Yes the dialogue is ludicrously bad, and sometimes even deeply cringey and possibly misogynistic/LGBTQ-phobic and it's dumb, dumb, dumb. But somehow the concept of the two Bounty Hunter teams, the opening where Riddick God of War 2's himself and after being ousted for being soft and gets his powers back in a fun self-contained little first act, makes the film quite fun. It's just a very good example of what this film could be, it probably couldn't have been much better and that's ok.",Riddick
74,nikola17,Vin Diesel comes again to Finish his Franchise of Riddick (A Little Spoiler),10,24 September 2013,"this more then SC-FI Movie this is more of Action Movie Believe me this is Really good film in (2013)it was been a awhile they made Riddick since (2004) All Way to (2013) wow that was longtime. Vin Diesel should do different movies he is just doing Fast And Furious Franchise i enjoy Fast and Furious Movies i Really love them but he should do Something Different but Any way he wants to complete Franchise of Fast and Furious and this now i Really like it his idea i love This Movie after 5 years when second Riddick was Done Riddick has become increasingly uneasy in his role as Lord Marshall of the Necromonger fleet. he killed his escort when they attempt to assassinate him (Karl Urban)Didn't do Much in this Movie but he was fine but i like new Cast Actors i liked Dave Batista he was Awesome as Villain Again like in The Man With Iron Fists (2012)and this is funny the girl form Pitch Black (Radha Mitchell)looks like Women in Riddick (2013) Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica is now in another Movie like Battlestar in Riddick Awesome kinda same characters same hair but she is more of Badass Girl then another one and Shot of Picture with landslide where Riddick Broke his leg in very nice view of place. i like the Action Scenes when Riddick kicked Machete to Guy Head because when guy said i will put your Head into the cube. Riddick was Unchained to his leg he kicked guy,Machete fell Riddick Kicks it Machete Chopped guy head off in half fell into cube. that was Awesome and Fight Scenes were Awesome when Riddick was fighting Big Guy,this movie was pretty good inserting in 5 years and i Remember when Riddick was talking about Johns his Father was in movie in actor in Pitch Black character of Johns William J. Johns was son in Pitch Black and Father was in Riddick 3rd named Boss Johns he was better character then his son in first one his son William was a bit of idiot as character but his father was more smarter he does a lot in this movie he was pretty good. i like part when Riddick was fighting with guy, Riddick throws the knife and guy with gun shoot's it they both dodge it the same time in slow motion that was awesome this movie was good i think you should check it out it is Violent,gore movie with lot's of Action thanks to Vin Diesel for bring franchise of Riddick.",Riddick
75,p-jonsson,Fairly okay but I was expecting more,6,19 January 2014,"Well, I did enjoy this movie. That has to be said. However, I was definitely expecting more out of it.The scenery and quite a lot of the action was not bad at all. When Riddick was in his best bad-ass mode I really enjoyed the movie. Sadly whoever wrote the script goofed that bit up quite a lot. I was expecting Riddick to haunt and take out the mercs one by one in his usual bad-ass way until only a few remained. Sadly enough this didn't happen. It started out quite well with the animal traps but then it just deteriorated into a rather silly plot with the mercs, especially the first group, being more than stupid.Speaking of mercs, what is this nonsense of ""new breed"" of mercs in the blurb for the movie? These are mercs are just normal Hollywood-style overly stupid humans. That was another thing that I was rather disappointed about.The first half of this movie, where Riddick fought the natural flora and fauna and got his cool ""pet"", was definitely the best. After that the script turned more nonsensical and Riddick lost much of his bad-ass cool-factor. The last bit was nice from a special effects point of view but it was not the Riddick that I hoped for.I would not say that this is a bad movie, I did enjoy it, but it is yet another opportunity for a great movie squandered by a poor Hollywood-style script. Of the three movies about Riddick I still consider The Chronicles of Riddick the best one.",Riddick
76,johnnymacbest,Riddick is back and better than ever!!,8,7 September 2013,"After brushing his shoulders off from the ambitious but critically panned Chronicles of Riddick(though I liked the director's cut)Riddick is back in his prime; more brutal and badass than ever before. Gone is the mythological stuff that was previously present, and in it's place is a tight, well-written storyline that feels similar in tone to the first film, but nevertheless is it's own beast of a film.Surprisingly, and to some which may be unexpected, Riddick actually has a soft spot. Considering that he's essentially a hardcore convict and murderer, the amount of heart that he shows to the alien dog is fascinating to watch as he explores the desolate planet's ruins to seek shelter from the harsh landscape and the vicious alien creatures that inhabit it. And the villains come off well-developed as well, with loads of humor, but also doesn't let us forget that they are cold-blooded and ruthless, who are more apt to stab you in the back for momentary personal gain.Also worth mentioning is the small scale of the conflict. Not too OTT action scenes which are well made, personal character studies(one gets the impression that Riddick secretly wants to die, but something is holding him back from doing so, which may be resolved in the sequel)and above all, a much better story with lots of twists thrown in. A far cry from Chronicles of Riddick, which many people were not to kindly off, but to some, has it's merits on it's own terms.The real question is: What's next for Riddick? Hopefully, this film does good business and gets a sequel that will further flesh out the intergalactic badass's character and universe. Riddick is back and better than ever!!",Riddick
77,rooee,Bargain Vin,4,13 September 2013,"Pitch Black was a streamlined sci-fi survival horror with real menace, which benefited from the fact that we were new to the character of Riddick (Vin Diesel), so we genuinely didn't know where his loyalties lay. Chronicles of Riddick couldn't repeat the same trick, so expanded into a planet-hopping saga, as replete with sub-Shakespearean political intrigue as it was with slow-mo shiv-swishing. Both films had their throwback charms.Perhaps Riddick – an independently financed attempt to recapture the high concept of the original movie – is a throwback too far. Riddick has always been tough as old boots, and David Twohy's universe has always been one where morality is an endangered species, but this time around most of homophobic and misogynistic dialogue seems to be laser-guided at Katee Sackhoff's mercenary, Dahl. The first film had Radha Mitchell's Fry; Chronicles had Alexa Davalos's Kyra. Both were whip-smart women who could hold their own. Here, Twohy is happy to give us a topless shot of Dahl (pronounced ""Doll""), but shies away from showing her letting the blood of an attempted rapist. Poor decisions.The story is episodic. We begin with Riddick upon an unknown, hostile planet. It's Vin versus the environment, and these are the best scenes: glorious primal vistas, choked with sulphuric smoke; weird creature design; weapons fashioned from rock and bone. We even get a cool canine companion. We EVEN get a cameo from Karl Urban. Soon, Riddick finds a bounty hunter station, and calls the mercs to his position. Two teams arrive: one reckless and greedy, the other cold and professional. Now it's Vin versus the mercs. But there's a storm coming, and it brings beasts...The film looks luscious, especially considering its sub-$40m budget. Twohy has a real eye for composition; and when the action comes, it is always clear and unfettered by silly editing. Riddick remains a reasonably compelling character, and it is endlessly amusing to watch him being the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time.But this is still the weakest in the series so far. After the strong opening, which recalls the Mad Max sequels in its sense of dangerous discovery, the middle act really drags. The mercenaries aren't as distinctive as the ensemble in Pitch Black, nor as marvellously OTT as the caricatures in Chronicles, so getting to know them is mostly joyless. The endless posturing becomes boring very quickly. Set-pieces that don't deserve the screen time are stretched beyond the patience threshold – the opening of a cupboard takes about ten minutes. It's a pity, because the final act – a return to the impossible odds of Pitch Black – is thrilling.Ultimately, this feels like a filler movie. It has great moments, but the unnecessary run-time, the ""old-fashioned"" humour, and the sluggish second act prevent it from matching its predecessors.",Riddick
78,bluesman-20,Riddick trapped on a planet almost as savage as he is.,10,7 September 2013,Do not see this if you have not seen Pitch Black and chronicles of Riddick first.This is a movie made for fans of Riddick. and it answers all of your questions that was left at the end of Chronicles. The storyline is basic. Riddick is betrayed and left to die on a planet that is hard boiled desert. the animal life on it is deadly to anything human. That is if it doesn't eat you first. Riddick is more animal then human. His savagery and cunning soon makes him king of a deathtrap of a planet. But Riddick wants revenge. He makes his way to a Merc emergency station. These stations are scattered throughout the galaxy. For the benefit of stranded Mercs. Riddick sees something that's so bad and so scary that he activates a emergency beacon that ID's him and that sends out a signal to two ships of bounty hunters. Both are after something only Riddick can give one wants the truth about the events that took place in Pitch Black. The other wants his head in a box. The Bounty Hunters and Riddick are forced to band together to fight a menace that'll devour every last one of them. Team infighting and mistrust give Riddick a edge that he uses. However when it comes done to survival they must do what they can to survive including trusting Riddick.the movie has witty one liners. And a smart sense of what it is trying to do. Vin Diesel once again triumph's in his portrayal of Riddick. The movie takes place in one location. The savage nameless planet. My wife expected more like chronicles of Riddick. Butthe action stays in one place like Pitch Black. If you watch all three movies together you'll see they tell one Story. And Riddick four if it gets made will continue that story even further. The only realized and fleshed out characters are Riddick. the Bounty hunters are just stereo types usually found in Sci-fi Movies. But Still Riddick is meant to be big screen entertainment. And it delivers.,Riddick
79,rollernerd,Unleash the animal within,7,25 August 2020,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the third and so far the final entry to the Riddick series, the action adventure sci-fi titled simply Riddick (2013) where we are reunited with Riddick played by the furious Vin Diesel who was named Lord Marshall of the Necromongers. Riddick is hating life as he does not accept the way of the Necromongers and finds himself as prey to assignation attempts. He is given a way out - give up the throne and in return he will be taken to his home planet Furya. Obviously, he gives up the throne to Vaako played by Karl Urban and is taken to a scorched dead planet where he is betrayed and left for dead. But what happens when you leave an animalistic man who is barely alive? Fighting for survival, just like the previous movies. But this time against alien predators more lethal and wilder than he has encountered. It's like an episode of Riddick vs the wild.The first few minutes of the movie there is no real dialogue as we see how Riddick tries to escape from the new planet's inhabitants and we get to see these creatures. The second part of the story is an introduce of a new bunch of characters - two groups of mercenaries who are on the hunt for Riddick. One group aim to take the bounty head, quite literally, while the other group is captained by a man whose pursuit of Riddick is more personal, which pays homage to Pitch Black. The third act of this flick is a massive storm covering planet where these mud creature like inhabitants are on the prowl for human flesh.The story is entertaining and we have decapitations, a battle between the mercs and the mud creatures and cheesy yet awesome one line dialogue. The supporting characters who are the mercs are well played and are developed just enough to be either liked or hate. Especially Bad Boys 2 alum Jordi Molla who plays the unsavoury Santana and Katee Sackhoff who plays Dahl as this hard headed merc very convincing, which is expected by the BattleStar Galactica actor. Her lustful and flirty like smirks and badass comments really nailed it. To me the real letdown in this flick was Dave Bautista's character Diaz, who had such promise. The acting was good but not enough character development was given. Like all we needed was a few more minutes so we see the full hidden agenda out of this character, plus the fight scene was a waste. To me Diaz was written as a dumb merc who towards the end did a few betrayals.The arc of Riddick felt more animal like where we get to see true survival skills and allows us to see what one does to make himself a proclaimed lord of the jungle or for this instance a scorched planet. The dynamic between Riddick and the dog really make this film and it sucks what happens in the end. The closing is arguably abrupt but is possibly intentional as it leaves you wanting more. Overall, another good science fiction story that links all previous movies and hopefully we get a fourth, 7.4/10",Riddick
80,dk77dk,The Extended Cut,8,31 March 2021,"Back to real action movie and R rating.The film is exactly as it should be, brutal, bloody and with a dose of humor. Again it's action on a desert planet, fighting monsters and surviving, but this time without some of the irritating characters we saw in the first part of the saga (Pitch Black).The film is well directed, the cinematography is good, the cast is not bad, the action scenes are great.The cinematography is good, the film is visually interesting, and some of the scenes are spectacular. The atmosphere is tense, and yet with a dose of dark humor.The extended version of the film is more complete than the theatrical version, contains more action and fills in some gaps. Vin Diesel is good in the role of Riddick, but the other characters are just as fun and interesting.A film that wants to entertain the viewer and definitely succeeds at it.Brutal, dark and entertaining.",Riddick
81,Jerghal,Return to the origin,8,24 September 2013,"After 'Chronicles' Riddick returns to the origins of the series with a smaller, more minimalistic film with fewer characters and more direct interaction. We get a new kind of monster and night gets swapped for day (mostly). 2 teams of bounty hunters come after Riddick's head and get caught in a game of cat (Riddick) and mouse (Poor Bountyhunters). The movie has quite nice visuals and decent effects considering the modest 38m$ budget. Diesel knows this character all too well so his performance is excellent. They do lay the 'legend of invincible Ridick' on bit thick sometimes. It's a good film but it can't match Pitch Black in quality or atmosphere. Considering the lack of box office success it will probably be the last in the series...",Riddick
82,martinrobertson300482,"I actually found myself liking ""Riddick""",8,25 October 2013,"Never saw ""The Chronicles of Riddick."" But I vaguely remember the first movie to star this ""tough"" character played by Vin Diesel - ""Pitch black."" I'm not quite sure what the draw of this character is, but they keep making movies about him, so I'm likely to occasionally get dragged along.I actually found myself liking ""Riddick"" however. And that's probably because I had absolutely no idea what was coming. I ended up liking most of its elements though. It goes from lone wolf survivor movie, to a monster movie similar to the first one. But does this with a great atmosphere, an interesting supporting cast, and is also brought to life by some great special effects.I don't think it really did that well at the box office, so this will maybe work better now as the end of a trilogy. I'm not going to jump on the same wagon as all the haters though. Because I was pleasantly surprised with it. Though maybe others (Like hardcore Vin Diesel fans) will have greater expectations.",Riddick
83,galahad58-1,Summer Movie At Last,8,8 September 2013,"In a summer that has been ridden with garbage (Lone Ranger type movies) it is nice to see a very well made movie come along. Riddick will not win any Oscars, but it is well made in every aspect. The acting is very good for an action/sci-fi/adventure film; the script is quality for the genre of movie; the special effects are fantastic; the action is believable and nicely done; and the cinematography is excellent. While there is that deja vu from the first film, it works and it is a very nice and enjoyable movie worth watching. A bit too many f-bombs that did not need to be in the film and the nude scene also didn't have a need to be there since nothing about it contributed to the plot.",Riddick
84,digdog-785-717538,"Well done, starts cool, becomes boring, ends badly.",6,12 September 2013,"Well done, starts cool, becomes boring, ends badly.End of review.Thank you for enjoying my awesome reviews, and i hope my Riddick review wasn't too short. I deliberately chose to avoid mentioning why the film is disappointing, just to make it easier for you to read the review.But if we really must, here is the problem.The film is well done. Vin Diesel is good at what he does, and the first half of the film creates a decent premise; it's also well filmed, well directed, at least in the first part, when the setup of the story is constructed.Unfortunately the second part of the story, the ""development"", doesn't really excite - and it also becomes too similar to the first two films, but in a bad way. The mercenaries are not viable characters, not in the same league as Riddick is. Frankly, we don't really care about their personalities, because they are just ""stock character: mercenary"", a far cry from the evil, perverted and lascivious William Johns from Pitch Black (the ""fake cop""). So a bunch of stock characters die, and meanwhile Riddick is out of the scene, so basically we are left waiting while the film pauses. At this point, i knew the film was dead in the water - too much runtime had passed, and there was no way to make the story go further.And the story doesn't go any further, it just deteriorates on yet- another bit from Pitch Black, with monsters coming out of the woodwork and Riddick as the dark-angel saviour. But do not be under the impression that i didn't like the ""same as Pitch Black"" thing; what i didn't like was the ""nowhere near Pitch Black"", no same pacing, no constructing the whole story around said monsters, no good characters, and not enough Vin Diesel.So take it as it is - a short, one hour of random Riddick adventures, fit for a YouTube cartoon, and another hour of filler, lifted right out of Gears Of War. One's good, the other's a bit rubbish, and that's it.My final vote - 6/10 Riddick fans yes, other no.",Riddick
85,Bruce722,In between the first two.,7,13 September 2013,"Riddick was a good movie and an interesting installment to the ""franchise"". I put quotes around it because these movies haven't really connected all that well. In fact, they've almost been more of stand alone films than anything. Vin Diesel was a B.A. as usual and the rest of the cast was solid. The overall feel of the movie didn't quite meet that Pitch Black vibe that was so special but it didn't feel like a Star Wars movie like Chronicles did. There's not much else to say other than it was just a good movie that doesn't quite reach that epic feel. There's that same situational dialogue humor that has been in both of the prior films and some really cool fight scenes. The entertainment value is pretty high but it doesn't feel like much progress was made towards any real story arc, which is probably it's biggest fall back for me.",Riddick
86,Tcarts76,Squeezing every ounce of juice from the lemon,2,9 December 2013,"""Riddick"" is the third installment of a series of Sci-fi action movies staring Vin Diesel. The First film ""Pitch Black,"" was actually a good film, the second, ""The Chronicles of Riddick,"" had a great cast and even though it got a bit muddy it wasn't bad. This one....It is just squeezing every last drop they could out of the first 2 movie's money train.This one is horrible. The actors enlisted are well below the ones in the first 2 but, I think they were decent actors who got handed horrible directing and a crappy script. The special effects were there, as expected, but if your over the age of 15...the dialog and script are just plain garbage. Vin Diesel usually, and especially in this series, gets a lot of little, entertaining one-liners, here they are just plain stupid, adolescent, and really just show this movie is less about entertainment and more about ripping people off by making people buy a ticket/rent a sub par, peace of crap product.I give this one a 2. It only has 2 redeeming qualities, there is violence, and Vin Diesel is in it. That's it. Anyone who wrote a glowing review...probably thought ""Show Girls,"" was the greatest love story ever made. After the first 2 in the trilogy, this one feels like a cheap Chinese rip off of an already bad DVD. My advice, rent Prometheus instead!",Riddick
87,pivic,"Wholly, hole-y not so good",3,22 February 2014,"Spoiler alert! At the end of this film, Riddick is almost eaten by a huge hole, that is, a gigantic mouth with massive teeth attached; he is then rescued by a woman whose lesbian sexuality is somehow important to the film; he has converted her, she now wants him. While this film is surrounded by a hole umbrage - pun intended - the lack of acting skills and the lame script lets this film down. It's like a mix of ""Rambo"", ""Alien"" and ""Starship Troopers"" but with the mouth of Philip Marlowe on Riddick, played well by Vin Diesel. All in all: avoid unless carnage is what you're looking for; I would encourage you to see the first Riddick film instead of this.",Riddick
88,FountainPen,Riddick-ulous,2,31 January 2018,"This flick got off to an extremely dull, draggy, boring start, and improved only very slightly, with a couple of bouts of heavy action & violence. I found the lead character, whom I refer to as Riddick-ulous, totally implausible and silly. 
I did like the machinery, the guns, and the nifty space scooters. 
One VERY major objection I have to this movie is the outrageously excessive use of the ""F"" word. No, it is NOT macho or cool to throw in an eff or an effing in almost every other sentence. I took two points off because of the obscenities. BAD writing! 
The female character Dahl was pretty cool. I'd liked to have seen her as the lead, instead of the rather odd ""Diesel"". 
Sorry, but I cannot recommend this flick. 2/10.",Riddick
89,rgblakey,Vin Diesel returns to the dark with Riddick,6,7 September 2013,"When Pitch Black burst into theaters in 2000 and introduced the world to Riddick and in turn Vin Diesel, it came as no shock that they moved forward with more adventures. Sadly the bigger budget follow-up Chronicles of Riddick didn't get the same reception so it seemed we had seen the last of everyone's favorite Furyan, but thanks to some smart business decisions and passion for the character Diesel and director Twohy have delivered an all-new adventure aptly titled Riddick, but does it return to what made the character great or continue on with the larger scale cluttered world? Riddick follows Furyan Riddick who has been betrayed and left for dead on a desolate planet fighting for survival against the deadly predators. But with something more dangerous on the horizon, Riddick sends out a distress beacon in hopes to bring bounty hunters to the planet for his escape, but those seeking a bounty and revenge walks into Riddick's vicious vengeance and become the hunted. With this latest installment they streamlined it back to more like Pitch Black and delivered a film miles above the previous entry. While it isn't quite as good as Pitch Black, it still brings everything you could have wanted from this type of film. The first half of the film is easily the best spending one on one time with Riddick as he struggles to survive. There are a few moments during this time that helps to effectively and simply explain how he got from ruling a planet to being near death on this planet. When the bounty hunters come things shift gears a bit and it feels more like the original film with Riddick somewhat knocked to the back allowing these mercenaries to take center stage. This is where some of the things don't work as much as most of their performances are pretty bad with the exception of Bookem Woodbine, the always badass Katee Sackhoff and beast of a man Dave Bautista. Sackhoff is easily the coolest of the bunch and while not given as much time with the action as she deserves still manages to make sure you know she's not playing around. Bautista is slowly establishing himself as a force to be reckoned with on the big screen with this his last and successful test run before bringing Marvel's Drax to life.The rest of the mercenaries just don't work all that well but mostly due to performances and cheesy dialogue. Diesel dives right back into the character like he never left showing a true passion he has for the character. Sure there are some cheesy moments from him, but that is part of the fun of the character. Well that and his complete bad ass look and ability to kill everyone and everything around him. The CGI was decent for most of the movie with the only real issue being the dog-like creature that was a central character. At first it was easy to dismiss them, but with one becoming a major player alongside Riddick it needed a little extra time spent to get more realism to the character. That being said with the streamlined budget to the film it is easy to let it go and just enjoy the old school science fiction aspect to the overall film. Sure there are some ridiculous moments and decisions made by some of the characters, but part of that is the charm of it all.The story here is pretty simple, but they did an interesting job of adding elements to connect this latest addition with both Pitch Black and Chronicles will letting it be its own movie. Diesel risked a lot to get Riddick back on the big screen and looks like it paid off. Returning to the roots of the character and making sure to include both throw away characters as well as badass ones that work made for an entertaining genre film. Hopefully this will be the return to this cool character and we can get more adventures that will hopefully continue to keep them simple as that's what makes the character so cool.",Riddick
90,CleveMan66,"""Riddick"" finds Vin Diesel on a very inhospitable planet (again), and entertains (again)!",7,27 August 2015,"""Riddick"" (R, 1:59) is a popcorn movie - and I mean that in a good way. Vin Diesel is back playing his futuristic escaped convict with the ability to see in the dark. It's the role that helped made him a star in the surprise hit ""Pitch Black"" in 2000. For the third time, Riddick is stranded on a VERY inhospitable planet. (Can't this guy ever get marooned on a planet with a nice, quiet beach or something?) This planet looks like the New Mexico desert, if it were designed by the ancient Mayans. A political rival from the planet that Riddick found himself on in ""Chronicles of Riddick"" (2004) sent him to this planet to die - and the planet seems willing to cooperate.To survive, Riddick has to battle lethal creatures on land, creatures in the water and creatures that go wherever the heck they want. Riddick really needs to just get off this planet. To do that, he sends a message into space, identifying himself and his location, hoping that someone who wants to bring him to justice will come to him... but only so he can steal their ship. Two ships arrive - one full of ruthless bounty hunters, and one captained by a man from Riddick's past who wants something more than Riddick's ""head in a box"". These two groups of men (and one very tough woman) are now at the mercy of the strong, smart and resourceful Riddick, as well as the planet that just might kill them all.This may sound like a typical sci-fi actioner, but the especially strong supporting cast make the film very interesting to watch and Riddick's impressive survival skills and just the right amount of humor make the movie a lot of fun as well. In the end, there may not be much more to this movie than seeing who survives and how, but with this movie, that's more than enough. I'm not ready to be rid of Riddick just yet. I give ""Riddick"" a ""B+"" and hope there will be another equally entertaining installment in our future.",Riddick
91,niutta-enrico,Amazing Sci-Fi Landscapes and Gear but,5,21 December 2013,"Well, you know, Riddick is from Fury, he is a warrior with no match in the entire Universe, he thinks and acts much faster and much more furiously (eh eh eh eh) than any other man so you must treat him very carefully and consider wisely if you really want to bother him.Unfortunately Galaxies are full of dumb oversize people who do not do they math before challenging such a tough nut and who do not watch his movies otherwise they'd be aware of what awaits them.So you can understand my disappointment when after watching this movie I realized that I enjoyed much more the really beautiful yellow and red planet landscapes and the really good looking weaponry and gear than the rest.Confrontations are slow, over spoken and repetitive, almost boring. Dialogues are dull and the overall script seems pointless as if the authors themselves have grown weary of the saga. What a pity.",Riddick
92,ivko,If you liked Pitch Black...,6,26 November 2019,"I admit I'm a fan of the Riddick series. They aren't great movies, but they're a fun bit of harmless diversion if you like the theme, which is moody, atmospheric sci-fi with some action elements. Like the previous films, Riddick starts with the eponymous character stuck in a bad situation that seems hopeless until his display of superhuman survival skills and guile. Also like the previous films, there are some authority figures that will reveal themselves to be worse than the famous outlaw and will mostly serve as cannon fodder before the end of the story.The movie has three main acts. The first is Riddick surviving on his own on a barren planet with a really hostile ecosystem. The second act introduces some human antagonists and shifts the narrative focus from Riddick to the new arrivals to give the viewer some time to get to know them. The third act is when everyone still alive has to (mostly) put their animosity aside for the sake of survival as the conditions on the ground suddenly change for the worse.The movie borrows heavily from 'Pitch Black'; so heavily, in fact, that the last act feels practically like a re shoot of the last act of the first movie, but with some updated cgi beasties. Barren, desert-like planet? Check. Dormant threat that only emerges during rare planetary conditions? Check. Gnarly monsters in the dark that only Riddick can properly see since apparently night vision technology is far more rare than it is in our world? Check.None of this completely ruins the movie, for me at least. It's a great setup that really made the first movie memorable. It just feels a little on the lazy side, and it's not the only place in the movie where it feels like they were cutting corners story-wise.In the second act there is a scene where the people battling Riddick take certain actions to safeguard themselves (I'm being intentionally vague here to describe the issue without revealing major plot elements). Riddick uses some trickery to plant seeds of doubt in their minds about their precautions, ultimately provoking them into checking if their defenses have been breached. So far, so good, but after verifying their systems they inexplicably leave their defenses offline and unguarded. It makes no sense at all and runs completely contrary to their earlier cautious actions, except that it serves the plot by allowing events that lay the foundation of the third act.There are a couple more situations like that, where people's actions don't mesh very well with previously established character traits and feel like the writers just needed them to be stupid for the sake of the plot. There are also some plot holes around the way the planets native lifeforms work, although at some point you just kind of have to accept that not everything is going to make sense and enjoy the movie for what it is: escapist fun.In the end it wasn't my favorite film of the series, but I still enjoyed it. Especially the first act with Riddick just finding a way to survive using his wits and whatever tools he could scrounge on a hostile world where, in his own words ""everything wants a piece of him."" Vin is a charismatic lead and it's fun to watch him growl his way through the insurmountable odds as he adds another chapter to the character's legend.",Riddick
93,datorsiers2,"Same old stuff, but worse.",3,17 December 2014,"If you have seen Pitch black and The Chronicles of Riddick, you have seen this one too, but this movie is not as well made as the first 2.This movie was not necessary, by hoping to take the franchise further, they only made it look worse, the first 2 parts were not bad and were quite enjoyable, but this was just the same movie, only with way worse effects and scenery. Well c'mon everything on the sun scorched planet looked like plastic, it was really low quality, i didn't expect the third part of this franchise to be that bad, many fans hoped to see something new and fresh, and yet almost 10 years after the part 2, we get this?

The 3rd Riddick movie returns somewhat to the style of the first, that is, to a deserted and dangerous planet with monsters, but also mercenaries.

It's not a serious movie like the previous two. It implies continuity at the end.",Riddick
95,achyutaghosh,Great comeback!,8,12 September 2013,"Riddick is a joyride for hardcore Vin Diesel fans, and then some. The most important news comes first- this may be the third film in the series but it is certainly not the end of it, rather it is a new beginning. The titular hero that bows to know man, likes to play the game of who is the better killer, can see in the dark, is virtually unkillable and other yada yada- Fans know for sure that the legend of Vin Diesel was build on this very character. The story is reminiscent of the first movie in the series- Pitch Black, where a group of survivors are left to guess on their own peril, whether Riddick is the bigger problem, or the planet and its other inhabitants. The first half of the film gets the I Am Legend treatment- focusing on Riddick trying to survive in an inhospitable planet, replete with reprehensible predators. As usual he does the unthinkable with minimum fuss in his own inimitable ways- including mending his own broken legs, domesticating an alien dog- hyena-zebra hybrid, and making himself immune to poisonous aliens. The second half is built more like Assault on Precinct 13, when two groups of bounty hunters, each replete with over the top characters, come to claim Riddick's head. ""One down... Three down. You see where I'm going with this? ""The movie is a shrine in honor of Vin Diesel- no one else really matters. The villains in the script are in awe of him, and even WWE superstar Dave Bautista does not survive more 30 seconds against him. Diesel in turn effortlessly carries the film- partly on his charisma, and partly on his biceps. As is a necessity for sci-fis, the visual effects are wonderful, the action is plenty, and there is no cutting back on gore. Sliced off brains and chopped off limbs are just starters, the main course is served towards the end, when Riddick single-handedly annihilates an entire race of blood-thirsty mud monsters.This is not a film vying for Oscars or critical acclaim. Riddick firmly sets to anoint Vin Diesel as the ultimate action hero of this generation and actually succeeds. At the same time, it quietly brushes under the carpet the abysmal second movie- Chronicles of Riddick. The stage being set now, bring on a fourth, David Twohy! 8/10",Riddick
96,repojack,The perfect role for Vin Diesel,8,28 October 2020,"The third Pitch Black film ""Riddick"" is much more focused than its predecessor and a welcome return to the formula that worked so well for the original movie.

97,azanti0029,One of the more interesting characters on screen today - but get a better writer,6,22 September 2013,"'Riddick' is the sequel that Vin Diesel put his house on the line for, and you can see he enjoys playing the character, he's played his twice before in the original Pitch Black, and the more epic, but less well realised 'Chronicles of Riddick' The visual images of these films have always been very strong, and the same can be said here of the third in the trilogy. Marooned and betrayed on a hostile world. Riddick seems happy enough to cut a living to survive in a hostile environment. He catches a young pup wolf (A cross between a wolf and a tiger) trains him, and has him as his companion. The first 30 minutes is not unlike the 1986 film Enemy Mine, as he learns how to combat the various beasties on the harsh planet and decides eventually he will have to leave, trekking to a mercenary outpost and calling its emergency beacon. It's here that the plot begins to weaken. Two teams arrive to collect Riddick, one wants his head, the other wants him alive. To ensure their ships cannot be stolen they remove key drives from each and lock them in a small tin cupboard which they attach an explosive device to (Seriously? The ships don't have a lock on the door or anything? Maybe you could just programme a code that needs to be entered on take off) Unfortunately the possession of these drives by one side or the other make up much of the remainder of the film. The dialogue here from some well drawn characters is especially weak and this is the films main Achilles heel. Diesel himself must have had a fair bit of sway with the director, so next time a good writer to work on the dialogue should definitely be called for. That said this is a beautifully made film, the CGI dog is actually very real and far less annoying than it could have been. Diesel does well with the lines he has and all but acquits himself and the supporting cast fill out their roles as needed. So its worth seeing and seeing on the big screen, but with the last twenty minutes a total retread of 'Pitch Black' it would have been nice to see some more original ideas and some variation.Worth your time, but its one of those films that when you leave you find yourself having wanted to like it more, which makes its flaws all the more glaring.",Riddick

99,quinnox-1,Good genre movie for science fiction fans,7,9 September 2013,"""Riddick"" was better than I thought it would be. I had read some mixed reviews and went to see it not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised, it was a good science fiction and action movie, and I think fans of the genre would be pleased. The storyline is a little bit confused, especially if you forgot what happened in the previous movies, but you can follow it along good enough and make sense of most of it.The movie starts out very strong, with Riddick stranded on an inhospitable and deadly alien planet filled with forbidding vistas and predator type wildlife that would love nothing better than to snack on a human for a quick meal. Riddick, the ultimate survivor, must contend with these creatures, and also with basics such as finding water and a place to shelter. I really enjoyed this opening act, and also the special effects and general look of the planet are very well done. I especially liked the colors used, a lot of yellow and orange hues that are striking to look at on screen and its effective in creating a rich atmosphere of a forbidding alien planet.I thought the acting of Riddick and the other characters in the movie was good overall, and even though most of the characters are minor, the actors did well to create a memorable impression.The movie is no masterpiece though and has its problems (some lame dialog, some of the action gets a bit tedious, and the movie also runs too long, should have been 90 minutes), but it has a definite appeal for fans of the previous movies and fans of the genre, and is entertaining to watch.",Riddick
100,JPfanatic93,Riddick rides again,6,21 September 2013,"Belated third installment of the so-called 'Riddick trilogy', which started with the moderate hit Pitch Black (2000) and continued with the overly grandiose The Chronicles of Riddick (2004), like this film (which in some territories carries the ominous subtitle Dead Man Stalking) written and directed by David Twohy. Vin Diesel returns as the muscular Richard B. Riddick, a member of the enigmatic, near extinct humanoid race called Furyans that can see in the dark, is adept at survival against all odds and generally proves hard to kill. Nevertheless, Riddick's new army of followers he conquered at the end of the previous film tries to do just that, leaving him for dead on a barren world populated by all manner of vicious beasts, where he himself still reigns supreme as the most dangerous predator of all (as usual). Nevertheless, driven by his primal instinct to return to his home world, Riddick decides to let his continued existence be known via an emergency beacon on a vacant outpost, after which two different teams of bounty hunters arrive to hunt him down. One of these is out solely for money, with the clear intent of 'ghosting' their prey as he's worth twice as much dead as he is alive, while the other is on a mission of a more personal nature, led by a father who believes he once lost his son at Riddick's cold hands. The latter team also comes with Katee Sackhoff, almost reprising her seminal role as Battlestar Galactica's Starbuck playing a tough woman who takes crap from no man and is fully able to defend herself from everybody who dares to try. Gratifying as it is to see Sackhoff can still balance smart, strong and sexy, her character proves fairly redundant as she has no singular action scenes of her own, save for a brief suspenseful shower sequence, while she's plagued by being the butt of sexually intimidating jokes for most of the film. After Riddick has outwitted and caused the deaths of half of the men out for his head, as well as having made off with vital starship components which prevent the teams from leaving, he successfully convinces them to seize hostilities for a while as a huge storm front is sweeping over their heads and brings forth great scores of hungry carnivores that want a piece of all of them. Soon, it seems as though even Riddick will not make it out alive this time, but we as an audience know better of course.For those who watched the trailer and wondered how the heck Riddick went from being a virtual emperor of the galaxy at the end of Chronicles of to a lone survivor on a desolate world at the start of Riddick, a narrative connection between the events of this film and its predecessor is all too briefly incorporated, as we are treated to seeing Karl Urban's Lord Vaako again for less than 60 seconds of screen time (a waste of a terrific actor!), despite the suggestion that the information he relays is crucial in some way: it would appear Twohy still has some sort of big pay-off in mind to close off what he started in the second film, but apparently he either didn't have the inspiration or the budget to treat that specific subject in this film, necessitating him to return to the tone and substance of the original. It all proves overly familiar territory, and often feels very much like an uninspired retread of Pitch Black, which also witnessed Riddick making an unlikely alliance with his enemies in order to escape the jaws and clutches of hordes of creepy creatures out for human blood on an inhospitable planet. Problem is, though Riddick ends up a fairly entertaining popcorn flick (especially for those who are new to the franchise), Pitch Black did it all better. It had more original visual design, less obvious digital monsters and made the character of Riddick feel more menacing and alien, while at this point we know exactly what to expect from his persona: a limited vocabulary, general growling and the usual bloodshed of (mostly unlikeable) characters standing in his way. Riddick sadly remains a one-note character played by an equally one-note actor. Now that Twohy has displayed there's just little more he can do with the Riddick character and the latter's coolness factor has decidedly worn off, this may be a good time to put an end to this franchise that so clearly was never meant to be a franchise, Twohy's hints at a fourth film not withstanding.",Riddick
101,tinovalkki,Pure Riddick,8,7 September 2013,"Riddick is Vin Diesel's gratitude to his fans and not bad one at all. Riddick is more like Pitch Black, than unsatisfying sequel of it. Story here is much basic and brutal than Chronicles of Riddick was. Riddick is partially quite beautiful to watch, but also quite shoddy in time to time. Cheap CGI looks quite unnatural partly. After box-office flopped Chronicles of Riddick Vin Diesel bought Riddick franchise from Universal and raised himself for this movie. 38 million is not a small budget, but compared to Chronicles of Riddick over 100 million budget it is a small budget to this kind of sci-fi movie. Movie splits in to two parts. First part of the movie tells the survival story of Riddick where he is left to die to a hostile planet. Second half of the movie is about to get away from the planet. Riddick is forced to launch a rescue beacon to get someone to come to pick him up. Unfortunately the first ship that arrives is full of bounty hunters. Shortly after this second ship lands with another group that want to find Riddick. Last part of the movie is typical cat and mouse play where enemies have to unite their power to survive from planets hostile creatures. It is almost like a renewal of Pitch Black, but that hardy let down Riddick fans. Story is quite linear and predictable. After all Riddick is quite tolerable sci-fi thriller. If you liked Pitch Black you surely like this one too. End of the movie leaves adequately room for sequel, which is quite guaranteed if box-office is sufficient enough. Hopefully it is and the Riddick will get well-earned ending for his saga.",Riddick
102,Sci-FiHorrorFan,Is this supposed to be a Sequel or Just a Crappy Remake of Pitch Black?.,4,23 October 2013,"I really wanted to like this film but sadly i Didn't,This Film Sucked. Everyone complains about the chronicles of Riddick being SO BAD yet THIS film gets the PASS? This film was BORING! and it had NO Action in it for the first Hour!!.Also everyone complains about how the chronicles of Riddick was NOTHING like pitch black and how chronicles should have been more like pitch black but yet We now have This film which is NOTHING like CHRONICLES and instead this third film is just like Pitch black.I don't blame the director for making this film just like the first film and i know why he did it,he did it because everyone was MOANING about how much they hated Chronicles and wanted to see pitch black again so that's obviously why the director chose this story,he made it like pitch black to please everyone,since everyone hated chronicles so much,Well i'm sorry but the chronicles of Riddick blows This Film Away!.Chronicles was Miles Better! because it had more Action and more fights! yet THAT film gets No Praise and THIS Boring Film gets the pass?. Nothing happens in this film for the LONGEST TIME! yet for some reason a lot of people think this film is better than chronicles???. Sorry i disagree and i feel that Riddick is the WORST film in the series. At least the chronicles of Riddick had the guts to be different but what does this film have? it has Nothing.All this film is, is a Crappy Remake of pitch black! you may as well just call this film Pitch Black 2. All this Film does is copy pitch black,This film is almost a duplicate of it,So This film Fails at Originality for Starters.I Can't Believe This is the ""FANTASTIC"" film that everyone likes???.I don't understand that,I nearly fell ASLEEP! watching this film!. The film has such a slow Pathetic beginning that it made me want to puke!. All we have is Riddick narrating and telling us what happened and how he ended up on the forbidden planet and how he was Betrayed by the Necromongers (As if i didn't see that coming) and then we have a flash back to the end of the second film,then we see what happens after that film and we see Riddick as the new Lord Marshal and we see Karl urban for only two minutes! which is pathetic!,i would have liked to have seen more of Karl urban! but NO instead all we get is a short cameo appearance from him and he does Nothing!. What was the point of Karl Urban returning as Vaako if he doesn't do anything??. We only see him in the flash back and after that we never see him again!.All i can say is i hope to see him again in the fourth film and that film will probably be better than this one!.The film then goes on and we have Riddick walking around on a desert for the longest time! and then he becomes friends with this creature and the creature becomes his companion and Riddick walks around everywhere with him.Now i will Admit I liked the bond he had with the creature i thought that was nice and i can say that was something different but that's about it because nothing else was. The film Then Drags on and Riddick fights ONE creature and that's it!. And this is the ""Great"" (Action packed) film that everyone Likes! and thinks is better than Chronicles???.BallSh*t! that makes NO SENSE!. This Film has LAME villains and week Boring villains and stupid characters that i didn't care about!. The only character i liked in this Film was Riddick! and that's it! he was the only good character in the whole film!. What kills me is that everyone looks at this film as Riddick returning to his roots???. People act as if he stopped being tough in chronicles. I hate to break it to people but he WAS Tough in chronicles,he kicked ASS in chronicles! but he does NOTHING in this film!. He does more Badass stuff in chronicles than he does here!. Riddick had a few cool moments in this film but not many!. there were times in this movie when Riddick did stupid things and he just didn't seem like himself and then he gets captured by the bounty hunters! because of a stupid choice he made! and that makes me Angry. Riddick is supposed to be cool Tough and SMART Not someone that gets himself captured!. I thought the bounty hunters were Lame bad guys and frankly i found the creatures more interesting than them!.I'm sorry but Karl urban and Colm Feore were tougher villains than anyone in this film!.The only good thing about this film were Riddick and the creatures i thought the creatures were cool but everything else Sucked! and it was a VERY SLOW film.Also the ending of this film was VERY LAME.

103,krbodkin,Mediocre,6,7 February 2020,"If Pitch Black was a happy accident, this is deliberately campy.There's too many instances of corniness.

If it was just him on a desolate planet this may have worked, but instead became an exercise in eye rolling.",Riddick
104,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film review: Pitch Black 2,7,8 September 2013,"I have been invested in Vin Diesel's Riddick since first experiencing Pitch Black and I find it hard to believe that it's been 13 years since it was released. The duality of this character or I should probably say multi-faceted character is fascinating and the journey to understand who he is and why he is this enigma of a perpetually reluctant hero has consistently been engaging. Initially, I was unable to truly discern from the trailer if the story took place pre Pitch Black or post Necromancers, but it appeared that he was wearing Necro attire which would place the story at some point after he commenced his reign from the edict that 'you keep what you kill. What I could discern from the trailer was that he was in another situation that was wrought with a deadly collection of monsters all of which were extremely dangerous. The how of what places him on planet Notfurya, which I prefer to call Predatorium was a fairly brief recollection of events by Riddick. The thing that took something like forever was the opening credits and his odyssey to adapt to this hostile environment. This story provided a connection to both predecessor films and was more like the first, than Chronicles. The special effects that delivered the aircrafts, the landscape of the planet and the carnage were first rate. The creature special effects could have been improved upon, the scorpion-like baddies were too similar to the creatures in Pitch and the canine's movement was too animated to ever truly believe that they were real. I was intrigued by the casting, I don't know what fountain of youth this guy is drinking from but Bokeem Woodbine (Moss) is simply ageless, I still see Joshua from Jason's Lyric and that was nineteen years ago. He is an actor that I feel should be given some serious recognition for his talent, he is always convincing no matter what type of role he plays. The only thing that I can say about Keri Hilson's (Prisoner) memorable acting debut is 'wow', she has a bright future as an actress. I will continue to follow Riddick on any and every future adventure but to date Chronicles is still my favorite, I have and can watch it repeatedly and am always entertained. I had high expectations for Riddick and it was more like Pitch black recycled with a splattering of some Die Hard with a Vengeance. Nevertheless, it was still entertaining and should be seen on the big screen for the effects. I give it an amber light.",Riddick
105,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,6,6 September 2013,"The first two Riddick movies, Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick, were just plain bad. The first one featured bad acting and worse CGI, and it was also really boring. The second is somewhat better from the CGI aspect, but the bad acting and boringness seem to have become a constant in the series. This year we got 'Riddick', and obviously I didn't expect much (who did?), but I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. That doesn't mean Riddick is a good movie - because it isn't - but if I compare what I expected after the first two and what I actually got, Riddick is so much better than I expected. If they really have to make more sequels, I just hope they keep getting better, like they seem to have done up to now.At the end of The Chronicles, our main character Riddick (Vin Diesel) had accidentally become lord of the Necromongers. At the beginning of this movie, however, he's lost on a deserted planet, fighting all sorts of aliens while looking for food and water. We discover he was betrayed: Vaako (Karl Urban) made him believe he'd bring him back to his home planet, Furya, in exchange for the throne. Riddick naively accepted and was left on this unknown planet. After being alone for a long time, Riddick finds a bounty hunters' house and sends out a distress call. Two ships respond, and the hunt between Riddick and the bounty hunters begins.The movie's fist act is almost perfect. Riddick, struggling to survive with a broken leg and multiple wounds, is attacked first by a pack of dog-like creatures, then by some strange scorpion-like aliens that live in water. He steals a small puppy - perhaps from the same ""dogs"" that attacked him? - to keep as a friend, as someone to talk to, and as someone to help him. This part also features good cinematography, some quite lovely wallpaper shots and the story is really interesting. But when the other characters enter the picture, this movie becomes a copy of Pitch Black - better, but still a copy. Although, the part where Riddick is hunting the bounty hunters while they think it's vice versa is also good.The following acts contain simply too much unnecessary cursing and sexual innuendo/reference/threats/pointless half-naked scene/you name it. Apart from Vin Diesel and a brief appearance by Karl Urban, there are mostly unknown actors in the movie, and they do a fairly good job. Not that their roles were too complicated to execute, mind you. Considering the small budget Riddick had, it looks really amazing, especially the CGI and especially when compared to the previous two. And again, comparison is necessary since after the first act 'Riddick' becomes Pitch Black - even some of the actors look similar. While a remake can be a good idea, a remake masked as an original movie isn't. Let's hope the next movie in the series will be more original than this one.Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",Riddick
106,horizon2008,Chronicles of Ridiculous,3,10 September 2013,"Needing to be a great actor isn't really necessary when it comes to action movies, and it takes a lot for there to be an exception to that rule, but three cheers for Vin Diesel, he's surely managed it here in Riddick. I haven't seen such bad workmanship in such a hotly anticipated movie in quite some time, gee this thing really stinks. The reviews here (so far) are giving the movie between 8 and 10 stars which is really quite surprising, given that it's so bad. Wooden acting really isn't the word for it, it's practically fossilized. Not one character carries the flick with any sense of power or direction and the lines, man the lines, they're cheesier than stilton. To watch Diesel spout dialogue which Arnie might get away with is cringeworthy, Diesel might think he's the next great action hero but he definitely ain't, the Riddick character is laughable to say the least. The CGI monsters aren't up to much either as the movements haven't been programmed that well. Really, I couldn't wait until it was over so I could at least say I got to the end. You will find yourself looking at your watch many times before you finally escape those cinema doors.It's sad that movies like this get such high scores on IMDb undeservedly as it creates comparisons with other great movies when there simply aren't any. Avoid this rubbish like the plague.",Riddick
107,evan_harvey,Fail as Riddick sequel,5,20 September 2013,"7.1 rating? Not even close. Flat 5. Here's why: It's basically a remake of the original Riddick film, but without as good a concept behind it, with a bucket of money and millions of green-screen shots. Very unambitious and a major step backwards after the second Riddick film. That's why it's so disappointing. On it's own merits, it's okay and quite watchable. As a sequel, it blows big time.To be fair, making a decent sequel to The Chronicles of Riddick would be a tough ask, as that film had a surprisingly good script, and leaves the ending somewhat ambiguous. It had a solid story that was coherent and ambitious, and connected decently with ""Pitch Black"", Riddick's first outing.However, they didn't bother making any effort to follow the second film. They tossed in a few scenes about the Necromongers that are completely foreign to the character of Riddick as some sort of justification for this film. Completely lazy.As a film, it's the standard 1 set C-grade type of film, but this time with a boatload of money for CGI. It does look great as far as that goes, but the story is mediocre, with so many egregious plot holes it's a little embarrassing.For what it is, it's actually not bad. However, as the sequel to the ambitious Chronicles of Riddick, it's a poor effort. The first 20 minutes are a charming take on one man and his pet dog, then the rest of the rubbish actors show up and it descends immediately into a cheaply-scripted, poorly plotted, badly acted straight-to-DVD flick.",Riddick
108,The_moan_of_all_moans,Nothing special.,5,12 September 2013,"I knew coming into this film what to expect; it was going to be very average, with drab acting and a plot with as much depth as Vin Diesel.It is a standard action film, with admittedly some cool scenes and for 10 minutes i felt genuinely hooked, but that's about it. Vin Diesel's voice is extremely annoying so when he begins the film narrating i was already beginning to slouch in my seat. Let's just say he's no Morgan Freeman. I honestly can't pick out one single performance worth noting. But it is what it is; there's no expectation; the trailer basically spells out what you're going to see.It is worth a watch despite it being the worst of the trilogy in my opinion. Just remember Vin Diesel is in it so it was always going to be average at best.",Riddick
109,s_campanale,"Back to Black for an Unchronicled Riddick - A simple cat and mouse sci-fi actioner heavy on gore, comedy and cute dogs.",8,6 September 2013,"2000's ""Pitch Black"" helped launch Vin ""that Jewish sniper guy from Saving Private Ryan"" Diesel as a star with his turn as amoral stellar outlaw John Riddick, stranded with various rag tag survivors on a desolate planet where vicious creatures came out only at night to hunt. Three years later Twohy expanded the mythology with ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", a ""Dune""/""Conan"" like saga that ended on a tantalising cliff- hanger with Riddick unexpectedly crowned king of his enemies the all- conquering religious cult the Necromongers. Alas the film tanked and Diesel's popularity was on the wane, and we were left hanging in eternal suspense, seemingly never destined to know how things turned out.Fast forward to 2013 and after re-launching himself to A-list with 3 audience and critic pleasing ""F&F""s he's finally turned his attention to Riddick, with Twohy back in the director's chair. Both have leaned from their bitter experience with ""Chronicles"" and gone back to a simple stripped down hunt and survive on a deadly planet scenario as per the original PB, a Friday night B-Movie with humble ambitions and an even humbler budget (38 Million, peanuts for a major film these days)The film starts with Riddick marooned on yet another inhospitable desert planet, fighting for survival against various local predators. The loose ends of ""Chronicles"" are finally resolved, showing how the crown ill fit his bald brow and how he was duped by his jealous rival Vaako (Karl Urban returning for a one-scene cameo) into a deadly ambush while searching for his original home planet of Furya, which had been enslaved by the Necromongers when he was but a baby. Beaten and humiliated Riddick realises he's going soft after the events of ""Chronicles"" and does it show. He looks scared now when facing monsters, and he even adopts a cute local Dog creature as his pet and companion (which looks and acts like it belongs in a Disney movie rather than an R-rated actioner) yet he is still a mean killer and tough guy. Needing a ride out of there, he sends a distress beacon which calls down two separate teams of Mercenaries, one a decent professional outfit run by Boss Johns (Matt Nable) and his tough right hand woman Dahl (Katee ""Starbuck"" Sackhoff), the other a bunch of crude and bad space pirates led by the vicious and unpleasant Santana (the great Jordi Molla) Most of the rest of the film is a ""First Blood"" like game of nerves between Riddick and the two teams played out in the desert and in the compound base. Lacking an ending, they create another ""countdown to doom"" planetary situation, after the fatal night of ""Pitch Black"" and the fatal daylight of ""Chronicles.."" we now have the fatal rain which brings out the deadly venomous lizard like predators which look like mini Cloverfield monsters with long scorpion tails. Sadly they cannot compare with the original ""PB"" monsters, being quite small and puny and easily killed off. The survivors race to retrieve the ships batteries that Riddick had stolen as collateral, and here Riddick learns to rely on others and know when and who to trust. He also discovers Boss John is the father of Johns, the drug addicted mercenary who was Riddick's main human opponent in ""PB"", who wants to know what really happened 13 years previously.The film moves along at a cracking pace and is never boring. Diesel has star power now and coasts along on it quite happily. The look of the film is Spartan, but effective, with yellow filters and color correction giving everything an other-worldly feel. The SFX aren't great but this film doesn't rely on them so much. The spaceships and space bikes look cheap, as do the Cloverfield scorpions and the space dogs, which seem to be motion captured Great Danes with bigger ears and furry shoulders, but it doesn't affect the movie that much. The supporting cast are good, especially during the middle ""cat and mouse"" section which is seen largely from their point of view. Molla makes for another slimy villain who gets a memorable if predictable demise at Riddick's hands, while Sackhoff is a veteran of the tough military space chick thing and does it again here. Nable creates a credible blend of menace and sympathy, especially at the end, and has probably the only character arc here. The other mercs are well played also, including Neil Napier as the young Bible-belt recruit, and Dave Bautista as Molla's burly Lieutenant who allows buffed but proportionate Diesel another chance to go one on one with a massive wrestler as Stallone has always been wont to do. The others, including Bokeem Woodbine, Raul Trujllio, Conrad Pla, Noah Danby and Neil Napier are all fine and mostly act as comic relief. The air generally is quite light, much lighter than either of the previous instalments, and there is even an upbeat happy ending (which left some fans bemused). Riddick may be going soft, but that is probably how we want him now, or at least how we want Diesel anyway.Finally tying up loose ends 9 years late, and reminding the world there's always been more to Diesel than Domenic Torretto, this is probably just the first in another chain of on-going adventures that'll be hitting us every couple of years. Not as Pitch Black as ""Pitch Black"" nor as epic and mythical as ""Chronicles"", it's an exciting fun film that will keep you entertained on a Friday or Saturday night.",Riddick
110,coljam21,Expected better,4,16 September 2013,"Surprised this got a rating of 7. Was excited to see this cause I loved The Chronicles of Riddick, but alas I was disappointed. This started out with a bore and ended with a bore. The only bit of excitement throughout this film was the silhouette of Riddick's naked body.The two mercs crews coming to retrieve him I understand. What I did not understand was the rapport between him and the Johns fellow. Who the heck was little Johns? Why would the director choose to base the relationship between Riddick and Big Johns on the son when we did not know him? That was confusing.Big Johns kept asking questing questions about his son little Johns and people in the audience were lost because we had no foundation to base this conversation, these questions on. Well the action was lack luster, the dialogue not much better. The characters a joke. Didn't really like anything about the movie save the dog.",Riddick
111,the_real_smile,Unbelievable remake of Pitch Black full of clichés,6,24 December 2013,"Wow, how many clichés can one put in a movie? First of all, let me tell you this is just a remake of Pitch Black, but instead of flying monsters there are crawling monsters and they copied the ""get the energy thing to the ship across a field of monsters"" exactly. The bad guys present themselves as the best of the best, yet are able to make the dumbest mistake after another and even lower themselves to act like a group of 5 year old children. In a particular scene Riddick comes to the bad guys, drops his weapons, the bad guys approach him and .... also drop their weapons ..., makes no sense at all. Then you must understand there are 2 groups of bad guys, who are competing at each other, yet the second group allows to put their precious energy cell of their vessel in a safe by group 1, the safe only being allow access to group number 1. Then they argue if their IDENTICAL ships can exchange the power-cells between the ships, which off course remains to be seen. Later in the story Riddick tricks them to open the safe, and instead of closing it right away, they leave it open to have some sort of coffee brake in the next room. If you still can stand the clichés and keep watching you have the usual ""don't look at that window"" scenes etc. Then the CGI, even a 2 year old can see the ""dogs"" aren't real, far from it, yet the whole movie is full of it. I would not say it's unwatchable, just don't expect an intelligent movie.",Riddick
112,StonedMagician,Good: 7.0,7,28 July 2019,"Almost a decade has passed since Vin Diesel last inhabited his starmaking role, the insanely tough, incredibly dangerous ex-con Richard B. Riddick. 2000's Pitch Black kicked off the series (and its lead's career) with an entertaining, if derivative, sci-fi horror flick. 2004's The Chronicles of Riddick, while visually striking, was neutered with its PG-13 rating and bafflingly incoherent storyline. This third entry gets back to basics, and in some ways feels almost like a reboot of Pitch Black, and one that comes with all the pros and cons that distinction implies. This time around, Riddick has been abandoned on an unnamed planet that is teeming with dangerous creatures that sleep by day and hunt by night. In a bid to get offworld, he activates a distress beacon, hoping to steal one of the investigating ships. Of course, bounty hunters arrive first, and what ensues is a claustrophobic mash-up of Mexican standoffs, hard stares, and bloody carnage. Like Pitch Black, the story here is minimal, action maximum. If this appeals to you, check it out. If not, simply don't bother.",Riddick
113,jake-179,Best sci fi movie in a long time!,10,17 October 2013,"I was really excited when I first learned they were making a long-anticipated third installment of the Riddick series, and I went to see this movie at the midnight showing opening night. It was every bit as good as I hoped it would be. If you liked the character of Richard B. Riddick from ""Pitch Black,"" ""The Chronicles of RIddick,"" and the video games and animated short, then this movie is an absolute must see. David Twohy and Vin Diesel did a magnificent job of furthering the story of the titular character and delivering a great Space Western, which is my favorite of the Sci Fi genres. If you like Sci Fi movies, especially Cowboy Style Space Westerns, this movie will not disappoint. Being basically an independent movie, Twohy and Diesel were free to make this movie as the passion project they envisioned, and that always has a better, more sincere quality than most studio projects. They really managed to recapture and further the awesome story of Richard B. Riddick. Riddick is just a great anti-hero, much like the various Clint Eastwood anti-heroes such as Josey Wales and Dirty Harry, or like Kurt Russell's Snake Plissken. Besides Diesel's bad-ass performance, the story of the movie is really awesome. The thing I liked about it is that it was very tight. Action packed, moving forward with great motivation and clever setups with exciting payoffs. It is great fun to watch how Riddick is out thinking his quarry, setting up traps for his attackers, and managing to out strategize his foes. The writing in this movie is just really smart and well thought out. It makes you sit there in your seat and think, ""I wish I could be that smart. I wish I could take on enemies like that. I wish I could come up with a strategy like that if I was ever in a similar situation where I had to fight for my life."" Don't listen to these dumb people who have been ripping on the movie. It is so unfortunate that, for whatever reason, audiences are very harsh when receiving Sci Fi movies. It seems like the nerds just can't wait to start blogging and ripping apart any movie that ISN'T Star Wars or Star Trek. Give this movie a chance! It is a really great story with some very interesting characters that are played against each other from every angle. The movie is totally action packed and is accentuated through out with Riddick's trademark low rumbling voice narrating his inner thoughts. I loved the movie, and I wish there were more movies like this. Totally awesome start to finish. Don't miss out on ""RIDDICK."" I know that Twohy and Diesel actually have two more sequels in mind, but I doubt we will ever see them. Such a shame. Riddick is an awesome character and very iconic. I wish they could come out with a new Riddick movie every couple of years.",Riddick
114,aaronjbong,"Revisiting ""Pitch Black""?",6,6 September 2013,"That's the kind of experience you're going to face when you watch this third installment of the ""Riddick"" franchise. Coming off the moderate second film, ""Riddick"" goes back to its roots and presents itself as basically a replica of the first film, a tale of survival. There is practically no story here. The only scene that had more of a story lies in the first ten minutes. And it's not part of the main storyline, it came as a flashback describing how Riddick ended up in the desolate planet that will become the setting of this film. It is revealed that after Riddick became the Lord Marshall of the Necromongers, he wished to go back to his home planet of Furya. He made a deal with Vaako that he will be brought to Furya in exchange of him relinquishing the crown to Vaako. After Riddick lands on a desolate planet which he believes to be Furya, it is revealed that it is not Furya and he has been betrayed by the Necromongers. The Necromongers leave him and Riddick is stranded here. From then on, there is no single mention of the Necromongers anymore and it's basically a revamped ""Pitch Black"" all over again. (At one point, Riddick even said that it was the beginning all over again). The first part of the movie was delivered in a very slow pace. We got to see Riddick beat up the deadly animals alone. There isn't a variety of creatures here; I only found three (striped feline creature, giant scorpions, and pterodactyls). However, there was one bright spot of the film that offered humor for the film and was a bit unexpected. Riddick takes care of one of the striped feline creature and soon it becomes Riddick's companion. The creature is actually quite adorable (an unusual word used to associate with the term ""Riddick""). That was the only character that was actually quite interesting. The other characters (the mercenaries) were dull and boring except the incredibly annoying Santana. I'll admit, at some points, he was actually pretty funny and provided the movie a comedic tone. However, sometimes, he just came across as being annoying and presenting the characters with additional problems. The side characters were basically unknown. You only know their names, but you don't know who they actually are. We don't know anything about them, because they're all so busy shooting the monsters. This is what goes on for the rest of the movie. The mercenaries hid the battery as they intend to use the function-less ship as bait. Riddick stole it and put it somewhere far away. They don't make an agreement until a storm comes where large hordes of giant scorpions come lurking out. The two alliances comply to each other's terms and attempt to pass through the large flocks of scorpions and retrieve the battery. That's basically the whole movie aka ""Pitch Black"" all again. The action sequences were quite thrilling, but nothing to brag about. It was quite standard with all the slashing and blood. The film is actually quite bloody and extreme. There are many decapitations and lots of blood. The creatures are too quite disgusting with all the organs lying around in some cases. But the action scenes were one of the positives of the movie. Another positive is the comedic theme incorporated here. It actually worked and was quite well done. ""Riddick"" is certainly an improvement over ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" but is definitely steps below the original ""Pitch Black"". It is basically a revamped version of ""Pitch Black"". Newcomers won't find this that great but fans should find themselves quite satisfied with this installment (although I was a bit let down by the alarmingly close similarity to the first film). Rating: 6/10Final Verdict: ""Riddick"" is a near-exact replica of the original ""Pitch Black"" that should offer enough to satisfy fans, but not newcomers.",Riddick
115,dutchchocolatecake,It just gets better and better,10,21 September 2013,"I really liked this movie. I hope Vin Diesel makes another one.I'd give this an 8 or 9 stars, but I'm upping it to 10 for all the fake bad reviews that are totally unjustified. This movie deserves better than 6.9 out of 10 for sure. Most people saw the other two movies, so I'm not sure what they were expecting with this one. If you've seen Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick; then you should know that you're going to get raw, gritty dialogue; bitter fights over who wears the pants of dominance, with some crazy action scenes. Riddick continues this tradition, so why people have a problem with it *now*, I have no idea.But here's a real kicker: this movie is a lot more psychologically complex than the other two, which has confused a lot of viewers who are used to disengaging their brains when they go to the movie theater. I saw this with Prometheus - a perfectly good movie trashed by the nonthinking masses because they were too dense to notice the finer subtleties.With Riddick there is nothing subtle, so nobody really has an excuse to pretend not to get the point. So it seems they just don't care for the underlying themes; which are a mishmash of primitivism and disdain for the domesticated life of privilege and how it divorced him from his survival instincts. The movie starts where Riddick is recalling what went wrong that led to the events of being stranded on a no-name planet; and it was being led away from his natural instincts by the artificial pleasure of the Necromunger Industrial Complex. I found the scene with the naked Necromunger women interesting - contrasting that with Dahl - a strong, muscular possibly-lesbian Merc he eventually takes in an interest in demonstrates his desire for naturalistic women who like him, act freely in self preservation.The issue with Dahl is interesting: She says she doesn't have sex with men, but ends up hooking up with Riddick towards the end (or at least it's implied). Two possibilities: One, that she Furyan and does not have sex with human men, but only male Furyans; or two, she really is a lesbian and thought he had genetic fitness to produce strong offspring. People don't stop to think that yes, lesbians in fact do want and have children; and that the process of choosing a donor may require the male proving his genetic fitness. The Darwinist perspective would fit well into this film.Like I said, this film is a lot more psychological than the other two; but that shouldn't stop people from enjoying it. If it does stop people from enjoying it then society has gotten a lot more dumbed down than I thought.",Riddick
116,Squrpleboy,Deep Space Mr. Potatohead,4,30 June 2015,"I think it really says something about your lack of ability as an actor (or your unrestrained ego, perhaps) when you allow yourself to star in a film where you are the lead character and yet everyone else is soooo much better than you in their roles. This, sadly, was my experience in watching Vin Diesel in RIDDICK.The movie had great production values and very believable special effects, realistic CGI, the story was a bit basic but entertaining enough, and the actors surrounding Diesel give their best with what they given throughout (the stand-out being Matt Nable, as Johns, who was excellent even). Then there was Vin Diesel. For one, I had to put on the English subtitles just to understand what mush was coming out of his mouth (his narration is hideous, he actually says ""nother"" in place of ""other"" and the preceding word did not end in an ""N""), he emotes throughout with virtually the same lack of expression one might order a pizza over the phone with, and quite frankly, his head just looks like a potato. I know that sounds mean and nit-picky but every time he came on screen I just couldn't stop thinking that he looks like someone glued a Mr. PotatoHead on a muscular body. It was hard to suspend your disbelief when you add it all up. I might have even been prone to forgiveness if he was a least laughable (like anything with Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson in it is), but it was just annoying.If you like scary aliens, spaceships, mercenaries, tech and other-worldly adventures this movie might be right up your alley, those parts of RIDDICK were decent, even good. But if you expect great, or even good quality, believable acting from the main and (what should be) most important character in the film I'd suggest skipping this one with a vengeance.If Mr. Potatohead and Star Trek had a baby, it would have been RIDDICK.",Riddick
117,aldri-feb,An empty-brain movie which is still fun to see,5,6 September 2013,"'Riddick' is a typical B-movie that surprisingly quite works as entertainment. Most of the film is thrilling and enjoyable. David Twohy as director has succeeded combining sci-fi action and ultra violent in a good way. Also fine performances from their entire casts (included Vin Diesel of course) help to increase the tense of the movie. Unfortunately, 'Riddick' lacks in a familiar storyline and ridiculous, non-sense moment. Some scenes in this movie remind me of 'Alien: Trilogy' and some kind of movies about people's survival in an unknown place. Riddick's character is pictured too strong that perhaps makes audiences bored and easily guess how it ends, also it sometimes dull and felt overlong. Overall, 'Riddick' is still acceptable especially for audience who loves seeing sci-fi action movie stuff, but don't mind of it's poor storyline just enjoy the action.",Riddick
118,Wirxaw,Quality remake.,7,16 January 2014,"What can I say... ""If you can't hate it - you are left with a choice whether to enjoy or not""... Well, at least this statement would fit the movie.While there are some lousy details, like clichéd biblical youngster(Pirates 4), rather pointless nude scenes, similar scenario to Pitch Black and opening premise, which parallels to Iron Man 3 - the way you DON'T want to see the main character... Riddick still manages to deliver.Good mix of survival\action with nice domesticating detail - cheesy, but as long as it doesn't twitch you... like many modern films do - what's wrong with that? Fair enough merc acting, Riddick is his usual state: ""The *censored* balls on this guy"" - good line from the film. Could be better, most certainly, but again - nothing revolting.Very diluted ending... very. Like the whole brutal movie ended in a soap opera. But at least it has a follow-up.It's sad that it took them 9 years to make a movie, but I suppose it's because of unfortunate financial failure of the sequel. Hopefully with profit from low budget of Riddick - we can expect to see part 4 sooner.So the conclusion would be that you may not enjoy the movie, but it would be pointless to dislike it. I've chosen to enjoy it, and for me it's worth 6-7\10.",Riddick
119,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,Are you afraid of the dark?,5,14 January 2014,"I have been a die hard Richard B. Riddick fan since the first movie. I bought the movies, I played the video games, I went to see the movies as fast as I could. When I saw that the third installment was coming out I was extremely excited. My childhood hero coming to the big screen again! And the result: O boy! What have you done?!This movie has so many problems it is almost impossible to analyze all of them. So let me focus on the main problems and maybe try to find something worth while in this disappointing flick.1) The story. There is nothing original, nothing interesting, nothing innovating about the story. It rejects the bad guys from Chronicles almost as if they are ashamed of them. One mention and a disappointingly small role by Urban. I had a feeling they wanted to erase the second movie form existence but they needed an intro into this one, and that is the only reason why there are about 7 min/119 min of Necromongers. The mercenaries are almost the same (phisically) from Chronicles and one of them has a link to Riddick that actually is nothing more that an homage to Pitch black. And that is actually all this story is, an homage to Pitch black. Almost the same sequences and the exact same plot. The interesting element is the first part where Riddick's life is holding on by the skin of it's teeth (and not the only time). So, we see Riddick in another form, vulnerable and hurt which is an interesting asset. The second part is the same as Pitch black, and the final half an hour is a good action packed part, but again - THE SAME AS PITCH BLACK (with one interesting twist).2) The production/direction. Visually, the movie is beautiful. The colors are bright and fit the story (!!!) perfectly. The movie has a good feel to it. No hard cuts or breaks in the storyline. It is elegant and watchable, dynamic and one has no feel that two hours passed. So, one good element is the fun this movie actually brings.3) The ending. I read somewhere that today Broadway refuses to create endings to it's plays because it leaves it to the imagination of the viewers. Was this the idea they had, or did they just run out of money? This movie has no ending, it has a great sequence near the end but no real ending. And that is maybe the worst problem of this movie. 4) Riddick. Hurt, left for dead, vulnerable, but every sequence he is in, he proves strong and dominant. This movie, if anything, shows that Riddick is Diesel's life role and alter ego.In conclusion, as I said in the beginning, there are a lot more problems than I stated (the acting, the holes in the story, the pathetic attempt to be politically correct etc.) but it is still a fun movie to watch. Do not expect a real sequel, expect a sort of remake of Pitch black with a few new elements that give it a new feel. But let's be honest, this script was a rewrite of Pitch black, and it lacks the legendary sentence: ""You're not afraid of dark, are you?"" I will never understand the need to create a sequel if a good script is not made. The same thing happened to Iron Man 3. Both times, the Riddick movies had a good script and Pitch black is considered a cult classic. A far better movie was expected. Richard Riddick deserves better than this!",Riddick

It's so annoying and needless. Equally annoying is the completely unnecessary animal violence. It seems like every movie that there's a beloved pet, the pretty always dies in a horrible way. Very frustrating and very again unnecessary!! I find it interesting that a good majority actors are animal rights activists yet they go along with this storyline everytime. WHY??

For the sake of it, the last third of the movie is a remake of the last third of pitch black. Its all set on one desert like planet, so no more space adventure or fancy technology. There is no army and few spaceship effects. Its basically a western film, more than a sci-fi.You've seen the story before in films like 'Soilder' and 'Rambo'. You've seen the monsters before in Pitch Black and Lassie. Ill even throw in 101 Dalmations as it seems fitting in this analogy. Riddick has super speed powers at some points of the story then loses them when it affects the plot, then gets them back (sortoff) before losing them again. I have no idea how his powers work or why.

Decent sci.fi. story line and effects. +1 for idiotic bounty hunder Santana. +1 for alien dog-like creatures. +1 for stamina and resilience to poisoning. +1 for toughy Katee Sackhoff. +1 for Diesel flirting with her. +1 for cinematography and barren scenery of obscure alien planet. -1 for story depending on overcomplicated spaceship driving details. +1 for not excessive gore, which doesn't bore. Overall, quite satisfying and recommended for fans of the sci.fi. genre.",Riddick
123,Valkonian,Good addition to the series,7,2 June 2021,"I enjoyed this movie, and it holds up on repeated viewings.Riddick is his pure badass self in this. I really wish we had MORE Riddick movies than the utter trash Fast and Furious movies we've been given. Vin Diesel is much better in this role. The female actor here I don't know why they went out of their way to make her so tough it ruined her character, and her acting was overplayed with the lines she was given. Some minor gripes but still a good action movie and good addition to the Riddick franchise.",Riddick
124,dinalt10,Dire rehash of Pitch Black,1,17 January 2014,"Another score on IMDb that beggars belief - how do these turkeys score more than 5 ???? This film screams low budget 'B Movie'...........which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as many low budget movies are excellent.Unfortunately Riddick isn't one of them.Pitch Black was an excellent film, and Chronicles of Riddick was a good film in its own right.So what went wrong with Riddick ??? Well, essentially it's almost a remake of Pitch Black from the second half onwards - except Pitch Black had far superior script and direction.And following on from 'Chronicles', this film had a rich universe to explore - instead of which it decides to concentrate on cheap CGI and an awful script.After hearing Karl Urban had signed up, I was expecting more than 2 minutes of screen time too. His character would have been a good counterbalance to Riddick..........instead of which we get a bunch of intellectually challenged 'Merc's'.In essence this was just a 'look how hard Vin Diesel is' film, where the Merc's (or most of them) fear him.And despite the poor CGI, the only time I felt emotionally involved with the film was when the poor CGI dog got shot!!!! And that says it all really - the characters were 2 dimensional at best.Despite that, I hope there's a 4th instalment - if only to find out if Riddick actually finds Furya.But avoid this turkey and rewatch Pitch Black if you want to see Riddick.",Riddick

126,TheMovieSnob247,Will they ever recreate the magic of Pitch Black?,3,17 June 2014,"In one word: disappointing. After a fantastic trailer, I had high hopes for this film and hoped it would recapture some of the magic of Pitch Black. Sadly, that didn't happen. While I liked that this went back to the essence of Pitch Black, the story wasn't very compelling, the dialogue and actors were horrible and this was easily the worst of the three films. The bright spot here is that Vin Diesel remains fantastic in this role and there's enough action to make it an enjoyable watch. In the end, this just seemed like a filler to reboot and relaunch the series. Even though I'll still watch the next Riddick film, I say pass on this one. Enjoyed my review? Keep in touch!

128,LordJiggy,Tough Guy and CGI,1,19 December 2013,"""Riddick 3"" is an ugly collision of B-movie tough guy clichés bathed lovingly in a lot of average to inept CGI. The basic plot has Riddick marooned on an inhospitable planet. It's a set up that gives Vin a chance to flex a lot, grunt, grimace, and mimic standard ""he's a real bad-ass"" trophes. One of them is seen in the trailers, which are basically flying motorcycles, including high rise handlebars, as made famous by ""Easy Rider"" and every other motor cycle fetish movie/magazine around. The other (spoiler) was uncomfortable to watch, and completely unnecessary to the film, where Riddick predicted he would be ""balls deep"" in the character played by Katee Sackhoff, and yes, at the end of the film, her character asked Riddick to boink her. It was so out of left-field for that character, completely unearned in the arc of the story, and embarrassingly juvenile: it made the film feel like fanfic written by an intelligent but completely socially awkward junior-high kid. There is a reason this film essentially tanked at the box office.",Riddick
129,Osmiumos,"Ahah ha ha, Twohy got his CGI dog",4,9 January 2021,"I remember watching the directors conversation on Chronicles of... and they didn't have the budget for the CGI for the dog to join them on the race against the rising sun so they had to kill the dog. And here we are, the whole point of this movie is that they have a budget for a CGI dog, because they clearly didn't have budget for an engaging story or quality dialogue. I like the Riddick movies, the first was a ripper, and the second was an ambitious epic... unfortunately this one is a remake of the first movie with a dog and it's a disappointing end for the Riddick saga.",Riddick
130,moby1974,Great to see him back,9,6 September 2013,"OK big fan of the 1st one, and I do like the 2nd one (directors cut though) and I can also see why some did not like the 2nd, it has some issues but the main one was the ALIEN 3 problem, that been after Aliens and all its army and guns, ALIEN 3 was no guns no army......people wanted more of the same, which in this case its funny to see that a 3rd Riddick film which gives people Riddick vs monsters is getting ""its a rehash"" Not sure what people want from a film like this, its pure comic book action, and I loved it, but you have to see what they were playing with, less than half the budget of the 2nd film and half as long to shoot, this is a labour of love for the Director and Vin, by today's PG13 Hollywood standards its a miracle it was made as a R/15, as for the film itself they seemed to make good use of the low budget, some very nice setups and yes in parts the low budget shows but as a whole its good, and that about sums up the film...GOOD, I rate it higher than most of Joe public but I am a fan and get more of a kick out of it, and going by the others in the cinema the feeling was ""a good action film"" while fans came out ""great, been waiting ages for this, now give us a 4th, finish the story"" I will go see it again and look forward to the BluRay",Riddick
131,InMyHonestOpinion,Sometimes your only option is to kill so you can survive,4,26 January 2015,"Trilogy's; Why do they exist, what is it that makes a writer, director, producer, film company say to themselves ""this story will be told in three parts"" Why do they find it so necessary? Is it all about the financial side of things? Or is it more deep rooted and they believe that the story they have to tell is so intense it will only be given a true identity if told over time. Ever since the dawn of cinema sequels and trilogies have been made but my question for you reading this right now is. Are they necessary? Why can't we take the entire story in just one sitting, perhaps less dialogue for those action films, or perhaps less landscape shots for the travelling films? Either way Riddick is the third installment of the Chronicle of Riddick films written by David Twohy, who previously wrote and directed the first two installments, Pitch Black (2000) and The Chronicles of Riddick (2004). All staring Vin Diesel as the man Riddick. I'm not sure if this particular trilogy is necessary I mean I loved the sequel The Chronicles of Riddick and kind of had high hopes for the finale. Following on from ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" film of 2004 Riddick has become uneasy in his role as Lord Marshall of the Necromonger fleet. He refuses to swear into the Necromonger faith which has caused lost trust among his people. Commander Vaako wishes to take Riddick's place as Lord Marshall so Riddick comes to an agreement with the man that he will take Riddick back to his home of Furya to live out his life. One of Vaako's aides Krone takes Riddick and few other soldiers to the planet but it isn't long before Riddick realises he has been played and he is in fact not on Freya but some other lost planet. Krone in an attempt to execute Riddick causes a landslide and buries Riddick alive, believing he has done what no- one else seemed capable of he then leaves the planet unaware Riddick has survived. Riddick ends up composing himself; fixing his broken leg he begins his long trek to find a way off the planet. Along the way he befriends a canine like animal as well as some alien creatures looking for their next meal. Riddick finds an abandoned mercenary station where he activates an emergency beacon in an attempt to get off the planet. The beacon ends up bringing two ships to the planet, as the time plays on a storm is getting ever closer Riddick is well aware of what that storm is bringing and needs to desperately leave the planet's surface before it's too late I've never been a huge fan of Vin Diesel( Need for Speed, XXX), I find him to be a perfect definition of the term ""meat head"" all brawn and very little brains, I mean sure he has done some decent things in the past but can you honestly say he's one of Hollywood's greatest stars? In saying that he doesn't disappoint in the third installment of The Chronicles of Riddick, his character is a meat head so I doubt any acting skills came into play whatsoever. You don't like him, you don't care for him, the character is lifeless, he says very little and if it wasn't for the awesome CGI companion he meets along the way this film would be unwatchable. What I did love though was the CGI; from the aliens to the canine I thought it was outstanding, great creature designs. The locations were amazing, not exactly sure where it was shot or even if it was all green screen, either way it looked amazing. The supporting actors Karl Urban, (Star Trek, Dredd) Jordi Mollà, (Bad Boys II, Blow) Matt Nable, (Arrow, Underbelly) Katee Sackhoff, (Battlestar Galactica, Longmire) and Dave Bautista (WWE, The Man With the Iron Fists) just to mention a few were just as terrible and really did nothing on screen worth mentioning. Riddick is a good film for what it is, it's classed as Sci-fi not sure if I agree with that though, it defiantly has sci-fi elements to it but then so does Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. It's great that David Twohy returned to his original idea of Pitch Black for the final installment with the setting and critters but due to the poor acting and even poorer storyline (especially after the second installment which I really enjoyed and totally class as Sci-fi) I really believe this is film to watch when you have nothing else to watch and you just want to watch something mindless. Not for the kids due to very graphic death scenes.",Riddick
132,miltonmunster,ridiculous,1,23 September 2019,"This has to be the most sillily scripted nonsense,I mean some of the others were like what the... but this was laughable.There were many ridiculous scenes but the one standing out is the tiny little cupboard you could chew through with an explosive lock for storing a tiny little power supply for an intergalactic space ship.Then the wacked out alarm/motion detection thing just made no sense whatsoever",Riddick
133,Camelot_2000,"Another Adventure From Riddick, But No Surprises Here",5,30 October 2016,"I saw this continuation of the ""Riddick"" series at the theatre with my friend when it first came out even though she truly wanted to see a horror flick playing at the screen next door. She seemingly enjoyed it and I'm glad I dragged her into it though she was somewhat feeling unwillingly.You see, I was a major fan of ""Pitch Black"" and the subsequent movies to follow and I felt the need to check out this newest instalment of the ""dangerous planet"" action adventure. It truly did deliver and Vin Diesel showed what fans expected, but you can't help, but feel it's giving another retread of the first film.Those desert, sometimes infernal, worlds really are inhospitable places to be and Riddick, without fail, always conquers that. He knows how to fight and kill anything- no matter how lethal - to come his way, but I felt something more 'newer', ""unexpected"" and ""more challenging"" would have sufficed. There were no surprises here.The characters were extremely likable though, with ""Boss Johns"" the bitter father holding a grudge against Riddick for killing his son in a previous film, but later forgives him after Riddick saves his life. The heartwarming moment was when they fly out of that hellish world in different spaceships and Johns blocks Riddick's to say goodbye. Luna, the young guy on Johns' crew, stands next to Johns and listens to what Riddick says about forgiveness and how we ""all eventually have to head home"".Obvious to see that Johns had another young guy (Luna) to replace the son he bitterly lost and that all concerned had reached a resolution of sorts. A very pleasing finale.",Riddick
134,schnoidl,laughably bad,5,30 October 2013,"watch it with the sound off, and enjoy the visuals. mostly. ignore the dumb animation of the dogs, which look like flowing weightless silk. enjoy the scary creatures, the honey light that tells us we're on weirdworld. ignore all the eyeroll moments and ridiculous plot holes (if you play a shots-for-clichés drinking game of any kind with this movie you won't make it 15 minutes before you pass out). Or, turn the sound up and hate your life. Vin Diesel, besides having the dumbest name ever, is little more than a security staff/bouncer with a really fantastic voice, but no charisma whatsoever to back it up. Watch him on a talk show sometime, and any power his voice has for you will disappear in a flash: he's really a nobody. His voiceovers are milk- through-the-nose howlers, so flat, so corny. I like the general idea of the Riddick character, but i really wish the franchise would at some point be turned over to someone with a working bullshit detector, but judging by the drooling approval this crap keeps getting, I doubt anybody's going to go to the trouble of changing the dopey formula.this is the kind of movie that gets made when your audience is people who spend 40 hours a week gaming.",Riddick
135,said-buet10,Back to the original formula,6,24 July 2017,If you liked Pitch Black you will like this.The story is again written in the original structure of 'Pitch Black' after taking a messy detour with 'The Chronicles of Riddick'. This coupled with some good action and common badass nature of Riddick resulted in a decent sci-fi flick.The direction and over all making is good. CGI is significantly better as we should expect from this time period.The casting I must say was pretty good. The actors playing all those heartless mercenaries were so good at their roles that this easily became a very likable solid action movie. And Riddick with his one liners and almost ridiculously planned schemes is too impressive to say the leastI personally have some issues with the third act of the movie but even with that this is a good action movie. I would easily recommend this to the action lovers.,Riddick

This is a more ADULT 'Riddick' with salty language not heard too much in the previous two films so it was a little bit jarring, yes i understand there were two teams of rowdy bounty hunters but this became a little repetitive with a lazy script.It is a fun and Entertaining Sci-Fi 'B' flick & Mr Diesel is again brilliant as Riddick.Is it the Best in the series? NOT for me that honour goes to the wonderfully made ""Chronicles"" most I know won't agree with this but that's fine...for me it upped the ante and was bigger in scope and more inventive.""Pitch Black"" 8/10 ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" 8.5/10 This 3rd movie ""Riddick"" is a fun one but scores a 7.So a thumbs up from me & i'd guess from the majority of Riddick fans but I do respect those who might have been a little disappointed by it.I know we've had three films but just HOPING WE GET at LEAST 1 MORE in THE SERIES (I'm sure the DVD's & Blu-Ray's for this series sell well for a 'cult' movie series much like ""DREDD"" and that should be enough for Universal to stump up enough for a fourth outing)",Riddick
137,felixmartinsson,Same old dark and monotonous,5,8 December 2013,"When the dragon-like bird began to gnaw on the hand coming up from the grit and the voice over by Riddick (Vin Diesel)first started I thought, wow this is going to be a great 119 minutes long movie. It was light, and you could actually see the good quality of the picture and visual effects. Because I had seen the other two Riddick movies I had high expectations on this one. I hoped for a movie that was less dark and monotonous, something new and fresh. It turned out to be just like the others, not bad but not great either. I was looking for a: ""This is phenomenal"" kind of feeling, too bad it never occurred.I think this movie has come to a pint where there should be no more, or David Twohy (The director) has to think of a new way to show Riddick. I mean Riddick is a interesting character and well executed by Vin Diesel, so I think there is something there. Speaking about characters, the actors in this movie did a great job with their characters, and that's the good thing about this movie, but the only good thing which is why I gave it 5/10 on IMDb.",Riddick
138,tiffanyyongwt,"it was even more interesting to watch Riddick ""flirting"" with her in his somewhat-sexy-drawl.",7,8 September 2013,"Here's another movie to add to my collection of ""Haven't-watched-the- first-few-installments-but-reviewing-the-sequel"". I had no idea this movie was a sequel, as the name of a sequel will usually indicate that it's an installment. This sci-fi movie is steered towards some humor and gore and a lot of action (duh!), which kept me engaged except for the lack of subtitles which left me wondering what Riddick was drawling about at certain parts of the film.So Riddick, a human-lookalike ""alien"" who can see in the dark, also known as a Furyan, a warrior race species (yes, it's a Alien versus Human-lookalike Alien war!). He's a survival, pretty smart given that he had no formal education. If you have not watched the first 2 installments, the opening might leave you a little befuddled. But it would kinda make sense 5- 10 minutes into the film, and everything was actually pretty straight forward and clear from then on, once the revelation sets in.My friend found the plot predictable, for example, the people who would die in the end, but I thought there were a few good surprises and twists. I like how there were 2 groups of mercenaries coming to capture Riddick, each with a different purpose. Before I could familiarize myself with every single one, three went down, saving me the trouble of remembering who's who.Boss Johns (Matt Nable) was the smarter leader of the two, someone you would expect to capture Riddick, and he had a complicated back story to unpack with Riddick (which will help you uncover his motives if you try re-watching Pitch Black beforehand). The only female in the male- dominant movie (unless the monsters are female), Dahl (Katee Sackhoff) behaved almost like guy, handled the sexist Santana (Jordi Mollà) as easy as you remember your alphabets. It was satisfying to watch how she punched him hard, showing some girl power. But it was even more interesting to watch Riddick ""flirting"" with her in his somewhat-sexy- drawl.Another notable character would be Santana (Jordi Mollà), he was so unscrupulous (Right From The Start!) that I couldn't wait for his death. His boastful shout-out to Riddick (wanting to put Riddick's head into the box for double bounty) came back to haunt him at various points of the film. And I have to admit, those moments are indeed heart-stopping. I shouldn't be giving too many spoilers if you haven't watched the film, but it is as scary and exciting as the Russian roulette. Not to forget, his own death, which give the audience a look at the cross-section of a human's head.Luna (Nolan Gerard Funk), the more humane (or you can say timid) one amongst the money hungry bounty hunters was perhaps the next best thing besides Riddick's matrix-like slide across the underside of the scorpion-like creature to kill it. He's such an eye-candy standing within the group of bulky hunters that I can't help but keep noticing him. You can bet many of the laugh-worthy moments came from him and his God-praying moments. And (Spoilers ahead) I'm glad to tell you, he was one of the few who survived the alien battle. Seriously, I was thinking halfway through the film (when I realize that the mercenaries were dying one by one), that I simply can't bear to see him die in the film (it would be such a pity!). I was very glad that the director/scriptwriter agreed with me too. :PFor full review: http://tiffanyyong.com/2013/09/05/riddick-movie-review/",Riddick
139,RagingDraugr,"OK, come on guys, you need to come up with better film titles for this series. They're just getting confusing...",6,23 January 2019,"(P) Positives(N) Negatives(?) Other points/Neither positive or negative(P) The story follows directly on from the events of 'The Chronicles Of Riddick', but it shares a lot more in common with the predecessor to 'Chronicles', 'Pitch Black' - due to it focusing on a smaller group of people on a single planet rather than spanning multiple planets. The plot centers around two groups of mercs arriving at a beautiful but dangerous planet filled with vicious creatures after receiving a distress call from an emergency beacon down on the planet's surface - a beacon which indicates that the notorious criminal, Richard B. Riddick, activated it.(P) Combining the best of the previous films - that being the action from 'The Chronicles Of Riddick' and the suspense and tension of 'Pitch Black'.(P) Much like the first film, despite much of 'Riddick' being a slow burn, it never feels sluggish or poorly paced.(P) Most of the characters were highly enjoyable, with Santana, the leader of the first group of mercs to arrive, being unstable and quick-to-anger; Diaz, played by Dave Bautista, whose dialogue is one of the only attempts at humour that actually work in this film (unlike most of the jokes involving Riddick's pet dog); and 'Boss', the leader of the second group who is later revealed to be William J. Johns' father (a character whose importance is not lost on those who have seen the first film) - he is searching for Riddick to find out what happened to his son.(P) Elaborate detail in the sets, props, and visual effects draw you into the world which the other two films did not accomplish as proficiently, which helps to further build the world (even if the CGI can be distractingly bad at times, particularly on the younger version of Riddick's adopted pet dog).(P) The cinematography is probably the best it's ever been in the series or at least a very close second to 'Pitch Black'; helps to make the colour and lighting 'pop', further showcasing and bringing to life the hostile alien world the film takes place on.(P) Action choreography was well done (or at the very least, was much better than 'Chronicles'), with a few creative kills dotted about. My favourite was Santana being killed by his own machete with Riddick still tied up - Riddick kicks the machete into the air, kicks Santana back into the wall, balances the knife on his foot before flicking it up and kicking the machete directly into Santana's head, slicing it clean off (As Keanu Reeves might say, ""Woah"").(P) Excellent and/or funny dialogue going back and forth between Johns' and Santana's teams; in particular, the scene which reveals that 'Boss' is William J. Johns' (from 'Pitch Black') father is very well done and stands out for how well it sets up said reveal.(P) The blood messages left by Riddick on the door and cabinet draw your attention thanks to the cinematography, and also demonstrate how he uses his mythical and legendary status as a ghostly killer to put all of the mercs on edge.(P) ""Morphine's always one of the first things to go"" - Dahl, one of Boss Johns' mercs --> Nice throwback to 'Pitch Black''s William J. Johns' morphine addiction as well as helping to 'tie' the universe together, connecting Boss Johns to his son.(P) Boss Johns learning from his son's mistakes by ""having a strong spine"" (i.e. coming back to save Riddick rather than abandoning him) which was an effective if somewhat simplistic character arc of letting go of his demons, and his hatred of Riddick - and trying to be 'the better man'.(?) Vaako's crone is actually called ""Krone"". Wut. Seems a bit too obvious a name for a henchman; but whatever, I guess.(N) It seems that when bringing elements from the first two films into this one, the amount of plot contrivances was also included in that transference. Here are just a few that I noticed: ""Why would you leave the cabinet with your ships' cells wide open, the things you absolutely 100% need to get off the planet? Makes it even easier for someone like Riddick to remove them noiselessly and escape. Also, leaving that skylight that's right above or at least very close to the cabinet open seems like a poor decision or oversight on Boss Johns' part...""; ""Why did Cyclops, the robot whose specific use is to track and pick up lifeforms or other structures at long range and in tough conditions, only just pick up those weird snake-scorpion-things when they were right on top of the mercs? Seems like this sudden limitation in Cyclops' abilities was included at this point only to add urgency to the situation at hand...""; ""Santana, even in his unhinged state, should be smart enough to know that his attempted attack on Riddick, even in chains, was extremely telegraphed - an infant would have seen it coming a mile away. Why not attack him from behind? He at least has a better chance of killing them (although, it must be said that this does end up leading to one of the more creative kills of the film...""; ""Why did Diaz keep firing his handgun after he was mortally wounded by Riddick's bone axe, which destroys the engine of the hoverbike - their only real form of transport? Did he do it on purpose? Seems convenient for the plot if Johns and Riddick can't easily make their way back to the ships...""(N) Santana's female prisoner is introduced, released and killed in the exact same scene by Santana; perhaps just to show us how evil he is? Seems the film could have gone about it another way other than having a scene with a character that ends up getting killed in said scene, making it seem like pointless padding.(N) The vast majority of jokes or moments featuring Riddick's new pet dog (throwing the knife/metallic object at the beginning hoping that the alien dog is like an earth dog that plays Fetch...and it actually does; relieving himself on a packet of dog food reserve etc).
Overall: 7/10 - maybe a mid to high 6 or a very low 8.",Riddick

Killer, quite, and cool is just the way Riddick should be, and Vin Diesel does a great job getting back to this character in the film. It started with the Necromongers (oh no them again) and got straight to story, monsters, and this time (not like the stupid comical ones from the second movie) ruthless bounty hunters. I take away a few points for unnecessary f-bombs that riddle the script, and add a few more back on with Katee Sackoff looking all macular and sexy. All in all I really liked the film.",Riddick
141,mecheart,"Thrilling days in the life of Richard Riddick, made for fans",10,7 September 2013,"While the scope of Richard Riddick's first silver screen appearance in 'Pitch Black' was limited to playing darkly well the false villain to an effective ensemble cast, and 'Chronicles of Riddick' raised him to malevolent demiurge status and added some mythological flesh to his bones, 'Riddick' narrows down the focus on the titular character and brutally demonstrates how titanic is his will to survive.This third installment of the epic of our heroic spacefaring Furyan is a much tighter character study which fulfills the aim of further developing Riddick by driving him to his limit and then much further. Where in the previous two films the screen was busy at times with other characters, races, even the interstellar campaign of an undead army, here Diesel's Riddick remains center stage for most of the running time. This film is a story about our hero ... that's it and it is absolutely the movie Riddick fans needed to see.Act one gives Riddick fans an extended, intimate, and savage what if scenario played out by their hero in several jaw droppingly rendered sequences set up to test every bit of his will and volcanic might. Interspersed with flashbacks used effectively to connect the second film to this third outing, the first act is paced slowly providing fans an opportunity to spend extended screen time with the interstellar barbarian many have compared to 'Conan' in space.The second act follows in the wake of Riddick's triumph over one of his toughest enemies yet and foreshadows an impeding doom even he does not want to stick around and face. The story finds him discovering a possible means of escape from his current predicament - as always at the expense of one or more mercs. Here the supporting cast appear and all perform suitably well considering who their characters are up against. Eye-shined doom anyone? To reveal even the name of a certain character introduced here would spoil a major sub-plot (do not read the dramatis personae!) but suffice it to say old demons come calling on Riddick but pale in comparison to what draws nearer on the horizon.Act three proves once again that while many, many mercs and other assorted would be do-gooders are just dying to meet Riddick, mostly they just die - and in some real eye catching spatters. As before Riddick must carry out his best laid plans carefully choosing who to trust, who to manipulate and who to remove from the scene. The climax and resolution are somewhat different from the other two films however, in retrospect although I did not at first care for the ending, I must admit it does show another side of the once Necromonger King and develops further his character in an important manner.Convict. King. Savage. Survivor. Riddick is the kind of hero in the shadows lacking for too long from contemporary cinema and print. He is someone most any of us can root for, sympathize with and outright raise up as he takes us out of our mundane cocoons and takes on lurkers in darkness none of us ourselves could stand up too. He is possessed of protean anger, monolithic strength and yet one of his greatest fears is that someone will feel enough for him to not betray his trust. Riddick is no merciless killer but he easily urges that mythology to precede him in most situations, allowing his legend to deal with the innocent who would impede him so he does not have too.In conclusion, the quality of the film is top notch. Science fiction elements are sufficiently, awesomely cool and neither the effects, the plot, nor the execution fall short of excellence for what they are - a few days in the life of one of the most interesting, resourceful and totally badass moster slayer characters in fiction today.So, was 'Riddick' worth the wait? Heck yes and then some - for fans; Absolutely, for everyone else who has seen the other two films or enjoys Dark Fantasy laden Science Fiction.Ten out of ten stars and two phantom ones for Riddick's construction and bloody awesome use of a bone and obsidian sword.",Riddick
142,sunshinebeachcinema,"Pure cheesy action, full of violence, monsters and one-liners.",6,29 September 2013,"The bleak yellow panorama of an arid alien landscape heralds the opening of Riddick, narration courtesy of Vin Diesel's resonating baritone, a rumble so deep that at times, you can barely understand what he's saying.A hand protrudes from rubble, drawing the curiosity of a circling vulture, dramatically strangled as Diesel punches through the surface to begin his latest outing as the space faring mercenary known as Riddick.This is the third reunion of producer/star Vin Diesel and writer/director David Twohy. Diesel's clearly a sucker for his sci-fi and fantasy: aside from writing the foreword to Dungeons & Dragons retrospectives, one of the reasons he agrees to keep making new instalments for the Fast & Furious franchise is for the rights to keep making Riddick films. Twohy meanwhile spends years at a time honing the script, with all the overblown action lingo he can muster.Looking briefly into the other films in the series, I have learned that this third instalment is something of a return to the series' roots, after the higher budget blockbuster The Chronicles of Riddick (2004) which did more to expand on the universe's mythology. Riddick is more monster movie than space opera.The first act is a survivalist story, which sees Riddick navigating the harsh alien terrain. It's an engrossing, character based introduction featuring little dialogue aside from Diesel's continuing snippets of narration. Flashbacks reveal that Riddick was recently the Lord of a dark and violent alien race, but was deceived and marooned on the planet where the action takes place. The gig obviously did not suit his loner survivalist personality.The locations are stylistically impressive. Far from claustrophobic, the wide other worldly vistas, every frame passed through an extremely yellow filter, emphasise the isolation of a single man, alone on a planet. It's not clear how long Riddick spends struggling against the elements, but he manages to entomb himself within the ruins of an ancient civilisation to heal his injuries, develop an immunity to the poison of a vicious mud monster, and raise a completely CGI, but thoroughly convincing canine companion, an alien jackal native to the planet, from a pup.But from across the savannah, brewing in the ever approaching rain, comes the threat of a whole swarm of these mud monsters, prompting Riddick to call an end to his solitude. He activates a distress beacon, drawing two teams of mercenaries hungry for the huge bounty on his head (which is doubled if he's brought in dead).The first are a rag tag band of piratical thugs led by the unhinged Santana (Jordi Molla, who plays well). They are soon joined by a second, more professionally organised team, who Santana resents for muscling in on his catch. The latecomers are helmed by a man named Johns (Matthew Nable).Johns has deeper reasons for being here that tie in to other films in the series. He and Santana are at loggerheads for much of the film, leading to some entertaining conflict. Their differences, naturally, become their undoing.Until now, we have seen little other than Riddick, but the man of the hour takes a step back and becomes a creature in the shadows. The narrative moves to follow the mercenaries as they try to root Riddick out, but are toyed with and picked off in the process.His natural abilities and time on the planet enable Riddick to run rings around the pursuers, leaving cryptic messages in blood around the mercenary station where they are based. By the third act, the common foe (the aforementioned monster horde) forces the two sides together, revealing who is the most ruthless and desperate.It is a testament to the versatility of the Riddick character that he can play lone protagonist, mysterious enemy and eventual saviour over the course of a single picture, elevating him above a mere muscle-bound one-liner spewing action hero.The lone female character (aside from a captive of Santana's, who exists as an establishing character moment for the sadistic mercenary) is Dahl (Katee Sackhoff), a member of Johns' team. Her unfortunate name allows the rest of the characters to call her ""doll"" and she is subjected to an unsettlingly misogynist treatment from the rest of the characters, and a throwaway line about her sexuality offers two interpretations.The best case scenario for the film's morality is a feint by Dahl to secure some kind of standing in the testosterone-fuelled world of the mercenary. If not, then the direction in which her relationship with Riddick (which stretches a little too far from banter) progresses becomes somewhat homophobic as well.Some of the character motivations are a little baffling given their situation, especially as the film progresses, but most of these other 'characters' fall into simple archetypes and exist only as fodder for either Riddick or the monsters, and are swiftly dispatched. The monsters fall prey to classic movie conservation rules: one on its own is deadly, but by the time the swarm comes, they are frequently dispatched, left, right and centre, with relative ease.Going to see a third Riddick film is essentially the sci-fi equivalent of going to see the latest Transporter, Die Hard, or indeed Fast & Furious. It's pure cheesy action, full of violence, monsters and one- liners. There's plenty of machismo, from the mercenaries, certainly (Dahl included) but especially from Riddick himself, who sets his own broken limbs and cauterises egregious wounds whilst fighting off hordes of alien beasts with an improvised jawbone machete.It's an easy entrance for newcomers, so casual viewers won't be disappointed, but fans of the series and mythology may regret the lack of any development to the overarching chronicle, as Riddick does little to advance this. It exists entirely to indulge in the character, throwing him an outlandish situation, and a couple of hours of screen time.",Riddick
143,Greekguy,"Back To Basics, or How Old School Rules",6,8 September 2013,"A good antihero is a wonderful thing, and Riddick is a commendable example. Having watched the evolution of this character over the course of one very good Sci-Fi outing (Pitch Black)and one very passable Sci-Fi mega-production (The Chronicles of Riddick), it was nice to welcome him back to smaller budgets and the authentic claustrophobia that befits an interstellar fugitive.""Riddick"" is a film that delivers what its core audience wants: the story never strays from what has been established, although there is the unfortunate drift towards ""How Incredible Is This Guy?"" that afflicts so many film series (cf. ""Iron Man"",""Dirty Harry"", ""Rocky""). Nonetheless, the action is both gloriously implausible and entertaining, and director David Twohy does a great job of keeping you in the same universe where you first joined this ride. In short, Riddick is spot-on, while ""Riddick"" is a little overblown.I will not reveal the end, but I will reveal that I was a little disappointed in its neatness. Clearly the script writer has more faith in the redemptive power of revealed truths than I do. This notwithstanding, for the period that I was in the cinema, I had a good time with my dangerous friend Richard Riddick, and I imagine that anyone who liked the first two films will do so, too. It is particularly recommended to those who preferred ""Pitch Black"" to ""The Chronicles of Riddick"". David Twohy is back home, and feeling fine.",Riddick
144,bm2759,It's not that good,5,16 September 2013,"Initially I wanted to write this off. I wasn't a huge fan of Pitch Black (PB) and Chronicles of Riddick (CoR) but I wanted to like this film. But then I heard from people that have already seen this and seemed to love it. But I didn't want to be swayed by popular opinion and thought I'd see it for myself. I had no expectations when entering the cinema.As the credit began I came to the conclusion this is not as good as PB and better than CoR. The first act was the best of the whole film where we see Riddick surviving and thriving. Along with back story on how he got there. Comparing this to the second and third act I wanted more of act one. The reason is as the film progress is becomes less enjoyable because the mercenaries were just not believable and their dialogue was poor. Also the way these mercs go about their business is just laughable, like children being given guns and told to go play.The serious tone of this film present until the mercs arrive is completely undone by not just their antics, but how Riddick goes about his. I won't spoil anything but the method he goes about his business doesn't make sense. You'll know what I mean as the film enters it's third act.I really didn't care about any of the characters either. Not one of them is worth it and seeing them die evokes no response. They are all just cannon fodder after all.No spoilers but the ending is a let down and bad.It passes as enjoyable and entertaining",Riddick
145,chi-cerca-trova,Spade Review for Riddick,2,1 October 2013,"Overall: This is a textbook example of poor editing, poor writing and poor directing. The first 20 minutes of this movie are slow and unnecessary, and by the time something interesting starts to happen, all interest is lost. Poorly acted and shot, with few saving graces, Riddick is a missed opportunity to make a passable, late summer sci-fi thriller. 2/10Detailed Review:A) Story/Script: Riddick ultimately suffers from extremely poor pacing and lackluster screen writing. The script takes easy, cheap routes with no thought to telling a coherent story. Hitting every sci fi/action cliché, this was an overall weak effort that barely warrants the time spent watching it. Case in point: before the actual business of the monsters comes into play, Santana and Dahl are wrestling on the ground, implying a possible rape (this comes after much posturing by the both of them). The scene fades away, with a shot on Riddick observing the situation; when we return to the scene, there are the results of a bloody fight on the ground, with a body imprint, bloody handprints, blood streaks, indicating a body being dragged away, etc. However, both Dahl and Santana are fine, breathing and standing, with only a casual explanation ""I had to smack him around a few more times"", and it is dropped. Just one of the many dropped threads in the story that detract from an already weak script. 2/10B) Characters: The ultimate problem this movie runs into with characterization is there is really nothing interesting for them to do. This is Riddick's show, so everyone else is essentially monster fodder. You have your sci fi thriller clichés: quiet leader, arrogant antagonist, tough as nails chick, etc. Ultimately, there is nothing there that really sets them apart from each other, each of the dying in surprisingly bland ways. Riddick is slightly fleshed out, but only by the virtue of this being a franchise movie. Other than that, these characters are mostly preoccupied with useless posturing and grimacing at each other. 2/10C) Design: There were some interesting creature designs, specifically the main monsters, but everything else was passable. Basic sci-fi architecture and design, but nothing that particularly stands out. 4/10 D) Sound/Music: Music is pretty forgettable, with a stereotypical techno/rock score. The foley mix is not terrible, but nothing particularly creative either. Bland all around. 4/10E) Purpose/Misc: ""Riddick"" really is a missed opportunity; a simple thriller like the original Pitch Black is not particularly difficult to make. The biggest issue with this film is the fact it seems to forget that ""Chronicles of Riddick"" is nearly 10 years old; the character is not one that has a significant recent memory outside of a relatively small fandom. You cannot make a movie about a character that the movie going public is not familiar with and expect to make a direct sequel. Overall, a lazy effort that is a disservice to loyal fans and waste of time for others. PS: Putting a ""tough"" chick in a movie that only growls about tough she and smacks a guy around once or twice, to only fall for the hero at the end does not make her a tough chick. This is not the 80's; there are plenty of female roles out there that do not need to bray about how tough they are; they just are. 3/10",Riddick
146,jojifrey,I only voted 6 stars -- and many spoilers abound,6,17 September 2013,"...as much as I like Riddick. As much as I missed seeing Vin playing this character for 9 years. Riddick is a brilliant potential character with a fantasy world that could be expanded more than just a story stuck in one unknown planet full of greasy aliens.But, that's the story that Diesel and Twohy came up with, and thus that's the movie I must watched to relinquish my thirst of waiting too long for a sequel of my most favorite anti-hero.Vin's physically still the best man to play an action movie, yet he looked... larger than expected. I like the picture, the beautiful imagination, and the dingo-alien dog. But the mercs.. hmmToo easy. Not a single interesting character within those hunters. Not even the female.Comedy?Dark gory bloody humor maybe.But no real good line compared to the chronicle's script.And Riddick healing his wound by himself: Oh-So-Rambo-Like!!!Welll... I know Vin really love his fans, and he tried his best performing in this movie, and all... but my feedback would be:Please make the sequel a BETTER WRITTEN SCRIPT.PLEASEEE UNIVERSAL PICS SUPPORT VIN DIESEL MAKING THIS RIDDICK SEQUEL BY GIVING A BETTER FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO BUY AND MAKE A BETTER MOVIE?YES, YES, I KNOW YOU HEARD ME, THANK YOU FOR THE ATTENTION.WILL WAIT FOR THE 4TH INSTALLMENT NEXT YEAR?TA!",Riddick

148,rune-andresen,Weak Script and Storyboarding - misleading rating on IMDb,3,20 January 2014,"As a Sci-Fi nerd I loved Pitch Black, and Vin Diesel did a great performance.However, this time the script and story boarding is very weak. I did like the very beginning of the movie, but the rest you already have seen before. Although some of the action scenes are pretty entertaining, they don't justify spending time & money to watch this move. Actually, IMDb let me down this time. I have been mislead to think this was a OK Sci-Fi with a 6.5 rating, but in my opinion this is hardly a 3.0. Actually, from now on I cannot trust the reviews and rates on this web page – at least not without some benchmarks.Some times a great movie is low rated, and sometimes a very weak movie is high rated on IMDb. I can only speculate why this is the case, but maybe my European taste differs a bit form the average American taste? Or, maybe it is just something else? Anyways, this time I was very disappointed. Vin Diesel himself didn't do a bad job. He repeated what he always did on these movies, neither in a very good or a very bad way. The true weakness of this movie is the scripting and the storyboarding. The other actors where OK as well (Though, I doubt if the will win any prices for their acting.)",Riddick
149,joechang-1,Big disappointment!,1,6 September 2013,"I went to see this movie with high expectation. Man, I was very disappointed.Pitch Black was a great film and Vin was in great shape. I thought The Chronicles of Riddick was bad enough, but Riddick 2013 was even worse.The first 30 minutes was boringly telling how Riddick got to the godforsaken planet, he discovered 3 animals, fish, dog, and a two legged scorpion. The fish for food, the dog for company and the two legged scorpions are the villains besides a bounty hunter named Santana. How stupid is that?I think the biggest problem is the directing skills of the director, he should be directing B class films instead of this type of big budget movies. He is just not there yet. Some scenes are just boring such as the conversations between two groups of bounty hunters, simply idiotic! The bounty hunters with the technology do intergalactic travels gotta be smarter than this!Vin, I saw you are one of the producers, I am sorry to tell you that ""job not well done.""And Vin, you should work out more like Dwayne Johnson, you looked fat and slow!",Riddick
150,mitcherator777,Great movie/sci-fi,8,14 September 2013,"This is one of the better Riddick movies out there. I really liked it a LOT. I don't want to give away too much so if you want the details..go watch it for yourself! I watched this movie for a few reasons: 1. It has Vin Diesel & Katie Sackoff in it..No better reason not to watch it just from that! 2. it's a Riddick movie. 3. Kick-a** Sci-Fi Movie!I really liked the movie a lot and there were a lot of great parts to the movie. The character that Diesel plays is pretty bad-a** and I gotta admit I really liked the way he played it. Even if you haven't seen the other Riddick movies I would HIGHLY recommend seeing this one. It is one of the better ones in my opinion and they did a an AWESOME Job on it.I am into Sci-Fi/Fantasy Genre and this one blew me away. 8/10 Stars on my watch. There were a few things that could have been improved however an 8 seems fair to me there weren't too many things I could complain about just minor things.Riddick was one of the best Sci-Fi Movies of 2013 in my books, next would be Oblivion & Elysium coming at a close 3rd or 4th.",Riddick
151,YellowTea,A Step Below Predecessors,6,6 May 2021,"A lukewarm rehash of Pitch Black, except with a bland cast, poor special effects, and some fairly lame dialogue.Diesel and Twohy clearly just wanted to get this film out before too much time had elapsed, but did so at the expense of quality. Diesel himself personally funded some of the film, which is a testament to how under-cooked and premature it was. Instead of waiting a little longer to expand the universe in a meaningful way, we get rain instead of darkness, ground-dwelling mud monsters instead of pterodactyls, a dog (which was cute, probably the only good thing about the movie), and Johns' dad.I hope Furya is better than this, but I'm not getting my hopes up if this instalment is any indication.

152,madsmartinussen,What a waste,5,4 November 2021,"When you make a film establishing a backstory for an entire universe and several different races inhabiting it, the sequel should expand on this, not dumb it down and focus on one boring dessert planet, 2 new creatures and a bunch of recycled characters. What a complete waste of the amazing mythology established in The Chronicles of Riddick (2004). So much could have been done with the world building in that film, Vin Diesel even said his vision for the Riddick films was something estimating The Lord of the Rings universe, and I truly believe that could have been the case if Twohy had decided to continue building on the amazing universe he created for ""Chronicles"". That movie was an epic adventure, with so many interesting characters and backstories, and this one could have done so much with that. One of the scripts apparently was about Riddick going to the Underverse after Kyra. THAT SOUNDS AMAZING!!?? Or, you know, he could have actually gone home, and we could have learned a bunch of new stuff about Furya, his parentage etc.But no! For reasons I'll probably never understand, Twohy decided to make Pitch Black again, only slightly worse. I say slightly though, because even though I was very disappointed with the departure from the mythology, I did enjoy the movie to some extent. But it is the worst of the three, and I really hope the next one will pick up where ""Chronicles"" left of.",Riddick

The way they manage to link all the movies together and bring the story forward is very nice.I was SO happy to learn that there was going to have another Riddick, I could not believe it and all the work they have put in this fourth movie is incredible.

If you want to watch something compelling then this isn't for you. Period dot. If you just want a mindless action movie then go for this one. People compare it to Pitch Black and say it's just a knock off, and, well, they're not totally wrong, but the predator chasing the prey story is one that's been around for years and it works. Are not all the sequels to Alien essentially the same? Are not all the Predator sequels the same? This follows that same formula, except, this time, Riddick is the predator and the bounty hunters are the prey, with a dash of aliens thrown in for more fun.
Ultimately, I don't enjoy this film because it's mind blowing the way the Terminator movies were. I enjoy this movie because Riddick is a mysterious character with a lot of depth and and I like to see him be redeemed. It doesn't get old.

156,The-Plague,"Left for dead on a new planet, Riddick finds himself pitted against new creatures and bounty hunters.",5,9 June 2014,"""Riddick,' which is the third installment in the film franchise (excluding the animated feature), follows Riddick (Vin Diesel), injured and left for dead on a new planet. As if the new planet's terrifying creatures are not enough to combat with, Riddick soon finds himself up against two different groups of mercenaries, one of which being highly trained. This movie, like the others is not short on violence, or scenes with mercenaries and large alien creatures that seemed to pop right out of a child's nightmare, but it is missing that certain something that undeniably made 'Pitch Black' the superior film.It seems that Riddick's appeal in 'Pitch Black' is that the audience knows nothing about him, but by the third installment of the film franchise we know too much. Rather than revamping his character, they give him a dog, and in their defense it is a pretty cool alien dog, but it certainly did not add dimension to his character. ""Riddick' is short on those Vin Diesel one liners from 'Pitch Black,' and he was just too dull. The alien creatures in the movie are too easily killed, along with the mercenaries, and at times it seems like the only reason you are rooting for Riddick is because his name is in the title.To the movie's credit, if tone and character development are taken out of consideration, this is not a bad action film. Granted, no one shouts ""get to the chopper!"" but it was at least visually appealing at times. The main problem I have with franchise reboots like 'Riddick' is that they rarely get rebooted. 'Batman Begins' was a proper franchise reboot, but 'Riddick' was more like the bucket of pig's blood falling on Carrie's head. You know what is going to happen but you have to watch, and afterwards boy do you regret it.",Riddick
157,mwburrows,A good return to form. Fans of the original will be pleased.,7,9 September 2013,"The third instalment in the Riddick series sees the titular anti-hero conned into returning to his native planet by the necro-mongers whose favour he was won, if only temporarily. When he is double-crossed and left to die, Riddick embarks on a journey of survival as he ""resets the clock to zero"" and starts all over again. Riddick has improved on the sequel to Pitch Black, ""Chronicles of Riddick"", in that it goes bigger but at the same time holds true to the original premise. Chronicles failed because it was TOO big, and too loosely tied to the ideas of the original. 2013s Riddick really goes back to basics with a small cast of characters and a focused plot - in fact, in some ways I think there was potential for three sequels squeezed into this film. The first act is a kind of wilderness survival, the second a tit-for-tat game of cat and mouse, and the third an epic confrontation between all the forces at play. It really changes direction several times and I wasn't quite expecting what I got. There is some quality comic relief on show and the rarest twinge of an emotional bond between Riddick and an alien dog he adopts, but it is underdeveloped and underused, which irked me as it had great potential. The writers also tried to form some kind of sexual innuendo between Riddick and ""Dahl"", the only female character. It is ultimately ineffective and leaves much to be desired. The Riddick-dog relationship yields the most emotional investment for the viewer, who will see as I did the waste in ending that bond too early in the film. Another note on sex: there's some very crude aforementioned innuendo in Riddick. It feels kind of unnecessary and threatens to drag the film into B-movie territory at points. No amount of good storytelling can excuse it, as the blatant sex talk feels like something a teenager would write and serves no real purpose. The character of Dahl too, feels unfairly used as a vehicle for it, and it never amounts to anything but more bad jokes.There's a couple of annoying clichés besides the ""tough chick"", including the ""religious guy"", for example. The writer acts wisely by limiting our exposure to them, especially the preachy kid who really annoyed me. ""Santana"" and ""Johns"" were the highlight of the supporting cast, providing just enough charisma and identity for you to enjoy their on screen presence.Story aside, Riddick looks spectacular. I'm not sure if it was filmed in 4K, thought it certainly looks like it. Some of the CGI was of such a high quality I found myself questioning whether it was prosthetics or not, or a combination of the two. It's really reached a level of quality so high that it feels like the creatures occupy the same physical space as the actors, adding to a grittiness that captures the action well. Creature design is great (although some obvious inspiration is taken from Alien), and rivals that of the original. Though carefully paced and (at times) not quite sure what it wanted to be, Riddick is a fitting conclusion to the trilogy that returns to the territory Pitch Black first explored. Those who didn't like the sequel Chronicles will definitely enjoy this 2013 offering instead, as it has all the essential components of the original mixed with some new ideas and a twist or two keep the story going. It's a flawed epic and won't win any awards, but it certainly will keep you entertained and is well worth the two hour investment.",Riddick

159,brendan-268,Haven't we seen this movie before?,5,29 October 2013,"I am a huge fan of the Chronicles of Riddick series.Pitch Black was a dark horse that came out of nowhere, and even though it borrowed elements from the Alien franchise, it sparkled with an originality and uniqueness that made it a memorable little film.Then along came the sequel, the Chronicles of Riddick, which has to be one of the best sequels, after The Empire Strikes Back, for taking a franchise to a whole other level rather than simply repeating the same formula from the original hit.I had been waiting for the third film with baited breath for years, and really couldn't wait to see how this trilogy was going to be developed, or ended.What I got was a paint-by-numbers rehash of the first film, but without any of the things that made the original so great.There are literally entire segments and concepts that are stolen from the first film, from the chained up Riddick, to the alien monsters, to the tough blonde female.What was so frustrating about this film was the fact that they had been handed a golden opportunity to develop an amazing story following on from the ending of the second movie, yet it is all just thrown out within in the opening act of this film with a cheap plot device that doesn't even really make a lot of sense when you stop and think about it.From there Riddick just follows the formula of Pitch Black, except this time the execution is nowhere near as competent.When the monsters do arrive the tension hasn't been properly built, and then the final stanza is rushed - the end result being a movie with a forgone and drama-less conclusion.To make matters worse we have a cheesy ending that literally looks like it was tacked on as a quick and easy wrap up to the film.As a fan of this franchise I have to say that Riddick was the worst of the three films, and it has squandered what easily could have been a sci-fi trilogy as unique and memorable as the original Star Wars one was.",Riddick

You don't end up caring about the fates of any of the mercenaries. They are just a bunch of people who show up and die.The creatures, who appear very early on in the movie, just don't make sense. So there's millions of them on this desolate landscape, but they don't eat each other or seem to come from any obvious location. They just all spring up when it starts raining.The lines are corny and uncomfortable. All in all it just wasn't a very good concept, and was made purely to cash in on the cult of Riddick, which is a shame. I just have a hard time believing it is a plot/script that the producers - Vin Diesel included - picked up and though, ""That is great!"" Still, my 13 year old son enjoyed it.",Riddick
162,firstruleofmethclub,May have put the nail in this struggling franchise,6,15 April 2015,"In this latest incarnation, Riddick goes boldly goes where no previous entry has gone before: Nowhere. Say what you will about the previous film (Chronicles of Riddick) at least it had the guts to take some risks. Sure, almost all of those ended up being complete misfires, but they were still taken. Riddick on the other hand plays it safe. It's a path not entirely without benefit, but one that was not expected from the series spawned by Australian cult-classic Pitch Black. Shoot me for saying it but I'm actually a huge fan of Davind Twohy (The Arrival, Waterworld, G.I. Jane, A Perfect Getaway) so I actually sort of hoped for more from the piece. Sure Chronicles was silly and disjointed, sure Dark Fury was totally unnecessary and Dark Athena/Butcher Bay were only intermittently decent, but overall the Riddick franchise will always be compared to Pitch Black, and against this prodigy, the latest movie is simply subpar. The Necromonger storyline has been all but dropped, any connections to previous characters (sans Riddick) are completely unbelievable and the events are a shameless rip off of the first film. Seeing a more ""survivalist"" and intelligent Riddick is nice, as it's always been sort of more insinuated than outright shown. The entire world that the events of the film take place on is even moderately interesting, and none of the actors or characters are outright let downs, but overall Riddick falls much closer to the ""barely watchable"" category than the ""brilliant"" one. It's ""cool"", it's pretty and it's most certainly entertaining, but it's not new, it's not clever, and it's most certainly not as good as Pitch Black. 62%-Gimly",Riddick
163,jacobywarner,7/10 You Must be Crazy,7,26 November 2019,"Looking at some of the reviews I think that there is far too much undeserved hate being attached to this film. I think that the overall final product is an enjoyable movie about a bad alien ruler who finds that he has lost who he is. Stranded on a deserted island he is forced to adapt becoming his bad original self. Although there is not much implicit meaning when it comes to this film, this is not an artsy non-mainstream movie and it should not be unfairly judged as one. This movie is a blockbuster meant to entertain the masses and I think that it does this perfectly, and maybe it is just my childhood love of this franchise that has allowed me to overlook the lack of depth but all and all this is an awesome movie. Vin Diesel fights alien scorpions for got sake, how can that be anything less than spectacular. So if you find yourself debating weather. or not you should watch this movie, please do and don't hate it for what it isn't love it for what it is.So that being said I give this movie a 7/10, and I hope that everyone will give it a chance. (However start by watching Chronicles of Riddick and Pitch Black first)",Riddick
164,dramafreak42,Three Different Films Crammed Into One,5,2 October 2014,"Despite being probably the most quality inconsistent franchise in recent memory, I've always like the Riddick films to various degrees. ""Pitch Black"" was a great intro for the character while ""Chronicles of Riddick"" got away from itself a bit but was still fun. My own personal favorite though is actually the animated short ""Dark Fury,"" and I kind of wish the makers of this film had done three shorts rather than make this movie. Because there are three extremely separate and distinct sections in this film, and they vary in quality as greatly as the rest of the franchise has.The first, and by far strongest, section is a straight forward survival story. Riddick has been left for dead on a near barren planet and has to figure out how to survive. He has to work his way around the local wildlife and figure out how to get the essentials he needs to keep from dying on this rock of a planet. This is all done with almost no dialog, and it's possibly the best thing that's ever been done with the character. No macho one-liners, no ridiculous mythology, just one complete bad-ass surviving on his own.Then the mercenaries hunting Riddick show up and the film shifts into its second section. This chunk of the film is told primarily from the perspective of the mercenaries, of which there are two competing teams. Riddick himself becomes something of like the boogie man in this scenario, popping up to pick off the mercs but otherwise sticking to the shadows and occasionally messing with their heads. While not as strong as the first section it's still an interesting take. Had this been a stand alone piece it would have worked like gangbusters, but the shift in perspective is a bit jarring coming off the heels of the first segment which focused so exclusively on Riddick himself.The final, and regrettably weakest, portion of the film is a straight up retread of ""Pitch Black"" where the characters who haven't already been killed have to band together in order to survive a wave of monsters and escape the planet. How badly this segment apes the original ""Pitch Black"" really drags the rest of the film down, especially since it's meant to be the overall climax of the movie. It's serviceable, but if you've seen ""Pitch Black"" then you've seen it already, and even if you haven't it's still not nearly as interesting as the first two portions of the film.This really does feel like they took three ideas and strung them together to make one film, and the flow is just as clunky as that description makes it sound. The film might have gotten away with it if the segments didn't get weaker and weaker with each one. Starting on the high note and ending on the low note just isn't how you want any film to progress. Had these been done as separate shorts then the first segment would probably have been my new favorite Riddick story, with the middle segment still being a good time. But by forcing it to be a feature length film and ending on the weakest note possible it bogs down the entire experience. As a Riddick fan it was worth seeing the once, but I doubt I'll ever feel the need to revisit this one.",Riddick
165,joelsmith190,Riddick (2013),6,29 January 2015,"This was the second Riddick movie I watched.It starts off really slow, and picks up really slow.The action and standoffs in this movie are really cool, it has some neat special effects, and so on.Plot-wise, it's a snore, and it's like Watchmen in the fact that every time you're about to give up on it, something cool happens. It's also very predictable.Another wacky kill happens that is hilariously cool and towards the end, it gets really good. But then it ends, leaving you wanting more.It's highly entertaining but is too short on the runtime and plot line. It's also painfully predictable.",Riddick
166,McCamyTaylor,"More Like the First Movie Than the Second, and Vin Diesel's Voice is The Star",7,30 September 2013,"The most important question for anyone trying to decide whether or not to see this film in the theaters is ""Is it more like Pitch Black or the fluffy sequel?"" Happy to say, it is more like Pitch Black. That isn't a spoiler, is it? I don't think so. If you have seen the previews or read the newspaper reviews, you have already figured that out for yourself. Glad to see the franchise getting back to its roots.Now, about Diesel's voice. It is amazing. Seriously the most amazing voice since Orson Welles. I usually hate voice over narration, (think Harrison Ford ruining ""Blade Runner"" or Tom Hanks going on about a ""box of chocolates"") but in this one it worked. It worked so well, that as I watched the movie, I began putting together a sci-fi version of ""Heart of Darkness"" in my head. Welles was always supposed to do Kurtz but never got around to it. Just set it on an alien world and have Diesel play the conqueror-gone-native that you don't get to see for the first half of the film so by the time he shows up he had better be something special a la Orson Welles in ""The Third Man"".Don't get me wrong. I love the whole Alien/Aliens feel of this film, with Riddick as the Alien/Aliens (who will he leave alive?). But if I had been completely engrossed in the movie, I would not have had the time to pitch another film idea to myself, now would I?",Riddick
167,starlimitz2,"Pitch Bla-- I mean, Riddick!",7,13 May 2014,"It's pretty much Pitch Black. It may be hard to believe that they would rehash the same basic premise from the very first movie so much that, aside from a few changes in character archetypes, it was almost plot- point to plot-point the same movie. This leaves a horrible smudge on the movie that is very hard to shake. Still, once you get past that little fact, there are still some good action sequences, as well as some new little tricks that one would come to expect from our main protagonist. There are some decently set up bounty hunters and space police clashes that bring a good tension, as well as some well-deserved horrific death scenes. As a stand alone movie, this could have been a great science fiction/horror film, but that's the problem, so was Pitch Black upon its first release. It had everything other than a massive budget, but that's what made it very unique. It introduced Riddick, who was a mysterious, and unknown bad ass at the time that the fans seemed to favor quite a bit. It's just a shame they had to scrape his character and stretch him over a franchise that should have stopped a long time ago.",Riddick
168,dmurilloroman,A Testosterone Filled Actioner,8,7 September 2013,"I am a huge fan of Riddick and now of this trilogy, which is sent off with a crowd pleasing bang. This film starts off fast and furious, mixing its action and outstanding special effects effectively. This film differs from the other two installments by adding more of a comedic factor into the story and also the character of Riddick seems unfamiliar at times by being, well, too comical and down to Earth, this transformation compares to John Mcclane's change of character in Die Hard 5. Surprisingly, this specific action flick hold's your attention completely throughout it's 2 hour runtime which seems to get more rare in films throughout the years. Even though the film obviously has a more limited setting and it's plot may look thin on paper, this flick is able to pull it off due to different and likable characters as well as visually stunning environments and effects. The hard R rating is pushed to the brink here, this is by far the most brutal and bloody outing from the Riddick trilogy and this just adds to the already entertaining adventure.",Riddick
169,ktyson9426,This should have been the 1st sequel,6,19 January 2014,"""Riddick"" gets back to the roots of the original Riddick character in the movie Pitch Black. Which I was glad to see them do. I LOVED the movie Pitch Black and the original Riddick character is one of my favorite tortured bad a$$'es with a heart anti hero's of all time. When they evolved the character to be some superhuman battling metaphysical forces in ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", it really irritated me. I loved the simple bad a$$ role and I just didn't get off on the over the top comic book approach.The movie does get back to the Pitch Black roots a bit to much and the plot is surprisingly similar to Pitch Black. Enough so it had me going ""wtf?"" towards the end... I mean if you're going to spend $20-$30M to make a movie, at least take the time to come up with an original plot.With that aside, the drama was sort of tired and recycled. While I love the Riddick character, I didn't find myself caring to much for any of the other characters like I did in Pitch Black. There was also a slight subtle humor in Pitch Black, and the original Riddick character had a really dry sense of humor that I thought was great. Unfortunately it was utterly lacking in this. There was a lot of action in this, which I would expect in a Riddick movie. Some of it was a little over the top with a certain degree of comic book silliness in my opinion, but I'm sure it would satisfy most fans of the character. The effects were pretty good, with one that was graphic enough to surprise and excited this cynic.Overall I liked it... And I think this should have been the sequel to Pitch Black in my opinion. My expectations might have been a bit high and I was a little disappointed, but it was much better than the 2nd Riddick movie in my opinion and leaves me with faith in the Riddick character.",Riddick
170,Jothos,WHY does Vin Diesel think these riddick movies are good??!!,1,20 September 2013,"SERIOUSLY! It's like these retarded, cheesy, wanna-be bad ass Riddick movies are Vin's pet project or something. If that's true, he should have picked a better pet project than these lame movies. The graphics look like something from the early 90's first of all. Second, the story is not interesting, and was made up by a room full of down syndrome patients. That's a fact. Probably. I already used to wonder why he made the first one. Then was baffled that he made a 2nd. Then when I saw the add there was gonna be another one, I was like ""WHY the F does he think this is a great franchise??!!"". It's a mediocre at best franchise. It should have died after the first steaming pile in the series he made. But he talks so passionately about them, like they're good. They're not Vin. Sorry. :-( Go cry now gay wadd. I've always saw Vin as one of those douche's that was a big geek (and not the cool kind, but the annoying kind) who thinks cuz he got buff, that he's not a dork anymore. He still talks like a gigantic douche-bag annoying geek though. Vin, go screw. :-)",Riddick
171,jvg37,Very entertaining popcorn flick!!! Not for young ones!!!,8,6 September 2013,"I saw Riddick last night and enjoyed it very much. No, it wasn't a perfect film, but I knew going in that I wasn't going to see an Oscar contender!!! The action and special effects were great, the story is nothing we haven't already seen before though it was well done, and the acting was as expected for this genre. What it does lack in originality, it makes up for in intensity. It is a violent film, but it is action violence and nowhere near ""torture porn"". Yes, you will have to suspend a good deal of belief, but no more than in any other action film. If you are looking for a heartwarming tale of humanity at it's best -- skip this one. If you are expecting a modern retelling of 2001, than forget this one. If you are looking for mindless entertainment with a lot of action and a plausible storyline, this is for you.",Riddick

Obviously made by fans of the series for fans of the series. Contains all of what people loved about the first two movies and combines it in an even more slightly adult (at least with the sexual...innuendos?) manner. Innuendos being questioned simply because it wasn't really HINTED at as much as said out right. The violence is there is all its fun, fantastic Riddick fashion. I was slightly disappointed in a lack of VARIETY with the terrifying aliens, although the ones that were there thrilled very well.

It starts off really well, Riddick being betrayed by the Necromongers under the pretense they will take him to Furya (it's worth noting at this point that although Karl Urban is high up the billing he is only in the film for 2 minutes). Riddick is instead taken to a desolate desert planet full of beasts that want to kill each other & Riddick, you later find out that things are going to get much worse once the rain engulfs the planet forcing all involved to find the displaced power nodes to she ships in order to escape from the planet (sound familiar?). In summary; Riddick raises a native puppy thing which inevitably dies later forcing him to shed a tear, too much talking, too little action - if you've seen Pitch Black then you've already seen this movie.",Riddick

A Furian conquers all just with its bare hands out of pure fury against the immoral, where fury and ethic are the most powerful forces in the Universe. This was the ultimate concept for many of us. Well the survival in this movie does not really depict the Furian, its just a sequence of lucky escapes and well timed exits that become predictable. Also, what about the big hole between The Furian Leader and the Necromongers, are we to assume they go on to conquer the universe? The Riddick was high in the action sci fi list for us all, it failed to really connect, and I am being polite, with the amazing introduction. I guess they pushed themselves too hard or maybe did not realize the true value of the story was in the pure element of relentless survival and conquer with biodegradability and the innate ability to adapt an improve rapidly. A real Furian should have walked back into the Necro's and had sex on the way with that queen, kept what he killed and done this with his bare hands. YOU MISSED OUT ON THIS ONE DUDES.",Riddick
176,btnthx,Fade to black,4,5 September 2013,"The science fiction genre is unique in the world of movies. The reason why this is so is because no other genre has fans that are so passionate about certain characters and their respective franchises. Think of the biggest followings out there for movies, with the exception of the comic book movies, are mostly science fiction. Love runs deep with these franchises, and there is little room for error when comes to the fan base. In 2000 ""Pitch Black"" was released and introduced us to Riddick and a new Sci-fi franchise, and I kind of have mixed feelings about that.While ""Pitch Black"" was new and fresh, with that hint of that old school sci-fi, it was everything that after that where the problem lies. ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" was more on the forgettable side and now we have ""Riddick"", shorter title, but still the same results. Riddick (Vin Diesel) is in his own words ""having one of those legendary bad days"". Still trying to get home, Riddick is left for dead on a planet that is unknown. Luckily for Riddick he is a survivor, or was a great Boy Scout at some point in his life, because he figures out how to live off the planet he is on. He does everything from fixing his broken leg, to taming the planets wildlife. For most of the first part of the movie, I thought I was watching a story about a boy and his dog. Riddick takes his new pet and finds a sort of ""time share"" place for bounty hunters when they are on the planet. He uses an emergency beacon to lure someone there, so that he can hitch a ride. Two different parties show up, and while they don't get along at first, they realize if they want to live, they will need to team up to get Riddick. The problem is that there lies a bigger problem than Riddick, and everyone must work together if they are all going to get off this planet alive.Now I always like to root for the hero, but I don't know if Riddick is the hero or the villain. Maybe anti-hero since he is an escape prisoner, so that should be a hint. Either way, I was not really rooting for Riddick to survive, because that could mean another sequel. Vin Diesel has a very limited range, he is a great voice actor (Iron Giant), and he can do the tough guy who is too cool (Fast & Furious), but that is about it. You will never have to worry about seeing Diesel in a David Mamet film, because he is a man of very little words. ""Riddick"" was written and directed by David Twohy who wrote and directed the previous two films. While surviving is pretty much the theme of the movie, you may wonder how you survived having to watch two hours of something that should have ended after ninety minutes, of the first film. Although Diesel has hit franchise gold with ""Fast & Furious "", lighting in most cases does not strike twice. To me it is easy, this is one franchise everyone involved should let fade to pitch black.Brian Taylor http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",Riddick
177,philipperousseau1,Out of Diesel,7,24 September 2013,"I gotta say that I'm not a HUGE fan of this trilogy and honestly I watched Pitch Black for the first time a bit later than I should've, actually I never understood it until recently and it was after I owned the chronicles of riddick and understood it. But this Riddick movie, 13 years after pitch black, I gotta say that it is kind of a bit disappointing. To be perfectly honest I just wanted more. Still the picture is pretty good and is worth to be seen. The riddick trilogy made me fall in love with sci-fi movies definitely and I am now a big fan of the Star Wars, Aliens, and stuff like that. So, visually, the film is astonishing. The special effects you see in it will look better to you than in many crappy 3D movies, and the thing is that the movie is....in 2D. The character, Riddick, is awesome. It is so much fun to watch him making jokes and being so relaxed all the time, in perfect control of his emotions whatever the situation is. So at the end, I wish there was more action in it and maybe some more solid stuff about the screenplay. But so far it stays a riddick movie, 13 years after pitch black, same director and same actor. Definitely not better than pitch black, probably better than the chronicles, well, depends of your opinion. Sci-fi movies addicts, fans of vin diesel movies, or whatever, you must see it.",Riddick
178,tetraslash,"Riddick was really just a retelling of Pitch Black, but in another setting",6,26 September 2013,"I give Riddick a rating of 6.5/10, with it lowered to 6 to weigh on the IMDb rating. This is an honest review of what the movie truly desires, and is not a hyped up review.When I watched this movie, I was going in expecting it to build onto the last movie and show him ruling as an overlord. What I didn't expect is for him to get thrown onto a random planet for the entire movie.But well, sure, fine. I'll let that one slide. So at this point, I'm expecting something interesting to happen, if that's what the movie is to be about.Turns out that it's just a filler movie, meant to earn a bit more revenue and not really serve any other purpose. There's going to be another movie after this, I assure you that (for those who haven't watched this yet).To keep a long review short: Riddick is essentially a remake of Pitch Black with different characters, setting, and scenes. But the premise and objective remains the exact same: Reluctantly help other people while escaping from the planet. Heck, even the whole idea of darkness-lurking monsters remains the same.I was relatively disappointed that the movie would just be a double of the original flick. The action felt a bit stale as well, and there weren't really any ""OMG"" moments added into the movie. There wasn't any truly unique scene to admire.I think the main problem with this movie is originality. The scriptwriter and planners couldn't think of what they wanted the third flick to be about. It would've probably been a much better idea to watch Riddick be an overlord (as you were led to believe in the last movie), but no, the director decided to bin that idea to make him be a wanted criminal again.At this point, since wasn't any character development, I'm not exactly sure where the series is headed. Riddick leaves with no friends or personal ties to anyone or anything in particular, and doesn't exactly have any goal in mind but to stay free. We all know that he's not going to be committing a crime anytime soon, so what will he come to? I just feel like the series is going to head downhill, unless the director twists his storyline and makes it head somewhere totally different.",Riddick

180,FugitiveAmoeba,The stakes are lower than ever,6,10 January 2014,"Riddick has long thrived as a cult-favorite for good reason. Everyone can get behind a reluctant hero, an outcast and more importantly a badass.As the title suggests, this is a no-frills, back-to-basics survival story of Riddick on a hostile planet. The wit, one-liners and cheesy action sequences are all there promising much in the first act of the film and by the end of its runtime, it delivers. Barely. The film is gimped by an important plot reference to ""Pitch Black"", which for the life of me I couldn't recollect and some strangely gratuitous sexism towards the only female character.With David Twohy's Riddick you always know what you're getting into. B-grade visuals, which would be egregious in any other action film become the hallmark of the series which is all about Riddick.

I take it Hollywood hires college kids to troll IMDb and write fake reviews to get people to to watch it! I can see why it barely made a profit over budget. I am so glad I did not wast $28 for 2 tickets. Acting was horrible. Vins lines were about as long as my review. There was no plot and was comical to see some of the primitive weapons used. What's with the golf ball? You never get into the characters because they are just thrown at you and you have to figure them out. Santana is horrible and annoying. Well, this will be the last riddick I see. I doubt they will make another because it only made $3 mil over budget which is like a happy meal profit to the rest of us. Thumbs down.

182,KoreanPenguin,Riddick... A Wasted Opportunity,5,23 September 2013,"""Riddick"" is a prime example of a movie you just don't spend money on Unless of course you fulfill a few different criteria. One being that you are a die-hard fan of the Riddick franchise/have an enormous man crush on Richard B. Riddick, which is completely reasonable by the way. The other being that money is simply not an obstacle to you, so spending it to excess or waste isn't a hindrance.Take this review with a grain of salt as this is only my opinion, and please don't spend as much time as I have mulling over the story and plot of this inadvertent remake of the first film in the Riddick franchise, ""Pitch Black"". Fanboys should remember the failure of 2004′s ""Chronicles of Riddick"", yet despite its toned down PG-13 rating, director David Twohy brings ""Riddick"" back to the gory and more explicit formula that made ""Pitch Black"" seem to work so much better. I might add I was a fan of Riddick in both previous entries.""Riddick"" starts out Book of Eli-style as Riddick chokeholds an alien on some planet he's been stranded on. There's a little bit of back story, narrated of course by the low tonal voice of Diesel himself. You are guaranteed to be lost if you aren't at all familiar with Riddick's back story (as told in the other films) but even those who know their way around will soon realize the storyline clearly never really mattered to Twohy anyway.It's not so much the environment. In fact, the opening 30 minutes of ""Riddick"" is quite entertaining. Riddick learns to survive in the harsh conditions of this new planet and he even trains up a wolf-alien-beast-dog. Audiences may grow just a little attached to their on-screen friendship. However, just as soon as we start thinking we are in for a treat, the ""Pitch Black"" formula is suddenly executed. Unfortunately, you can't teach an old dog new tricks Or in this case a wolf alien dog or something.Riddick finds some distress beacon or something and before you know it, there are bounty hunters crawling all over Riddick's territory. Clearly he just needs a ride off the planet, but the 'mercs' that land are here to kill. This is where ""Riddick"" starts to fall apart. Suddenly we don't see Riddick for a while, and Twohy forces us to hang out with two groups of mindless killers. We miss him, and we don't like them, and by the time he's finally getting screen time, Twohy has lost us completely.Jordi Mollá plays Santana, the boss mercenary of the first group, alongside Diaz, also known as wrestler Dave Bautista, who for some reason decided to pursue an acting career. If you have seen the third installment in the ""Scorpion King"" franchise, or ""Man with the Iron Fists"" you might be skeptical as well. Diaz is so-so, and Santana is a mess. He's somehow landed the respect of a group of cutthroat killers yet he flinches at the sight of a fellow mercenary being cut into thirds. He's a revolting rapist who we feel no sympathy for. Perhaps we wish he wasn't even in our story.Within time, a second group lands on this undisclosed planet. I guess the leader of this group, Boss Johns (Matt Nable) is the father of some character from ""Chronicles of Riddick"" or something, but who knows at this point. He brings some forgettable gun-slingers with him, and also the butch Dahl (Katee Sackhoff). You may know her from ""Battlestar Galactica"" but all we know is Dahl finds every opportunity to counter an argument with whatever string of curses come to her mind first. She's quite bland, and besides the completely endless and pointless 30- second shot of some naked women caressing Riddick earlier on, she stands in the nude, taking a shower. This is a wonderful example of a director who seems to have lost his vision of what makes a movie work and resorts to including absurd and fruitless scenes that do nothing to push the story forward. It almost feels borderline offensive, especially if Twohy had to stand in front of a room full of women and explain why he believed these were thoughtful and meaningful inclusions to ""Riddick"" But I digress.The script plays not only off of ""Pitch Black"" constantly (mercenaries here to kill Riddick realize that nightfall will kill them first, then realizing they need Riddick in order to survive) but relies on well-known sci-fi references or clichés to move forward. Aliens try to break in through every crevice of a building filled with guys with tons of firepower ""Aliens"" anyone? Or how about when the 'mercs' hop on their Harley Davidson inspired hover bikes? It screams swoop bikes from ""Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"". Sometimes elements like these work as homage to the old greats in filmmaking history, but here they feel lazy, and devoid of imagination.The banter back and forth between characters is sometimes painful, or usually painful. It's the kind of dialog you are writing in your head as the movie progresses. Imagine two four-year-old children bickering back and forth. Now pretend they are twenty years older and are dropping ""f"" bombs every other word.I've been harsh here, but it's only because I believe Twohy could do much better. This is practically a give-up effort, and it's sad to see the franchise has fallen this low.In order to prevent the two ships from leaving the planet without him, Riddick steals some sort of power core from the groups. In effect, he holds the entire situation in his hands, without anyone able to leave. Riddick holds collateral over the mercs, not allowing them to leave the planet, and in the same way, the only thing holding us in our theater seating is the fact that we paid $9 for a movie ticket.",Riddick
183,woodiphora,Yawn ...,2,5 November 2013,"In a word, expensively dull. OK, that was two words. Diesel gets another outing as Riddick, but stripped of pretty much everything that Pitch Black did well and Chronicles did passably.I've a strong impression that Pitch Black was a good movie by accident, rather than design. Twohy assembled a group of B-list actors and unknowns, but whom gelled well and gave the whole movies a lot of personality. The set and monster design, sub-plots and back stories gave the movie a lot of extra life (note, not directly Twohy's work), the CGI was relatively minimal ... and Diesel didn't actually say that much. Riddick was just one of a number of players. And there was humour. It worked, enjoyably.Chronicles was an interesting attempt to build on the Riddick character and had some entertaining extended set pieces and concepts, but burned itself out towards the end of the movie. The canvas became very overworked.So, number three ... largely Diesel grunting and groaning his way through various ugly situations, with unconvincing CGI effects, and discovering ... what? There are no sympathetic characters, no humour and no ending.Give an infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of typewriters and an infinite amount of time, and eventually they'll come up with Hamlet. Give David Twohy an infinite number of B-actors, an infinite amount of funding and an infinite amount of time, and I maybe he'll make another entertaining movie, but this isn't it. Just dumping Diesel in the middle of a dull script and hoping the CGI will hold the whole premise up does not make a movie. Must do better.It's watchable 'til the end, hence two stars, not one. But then so is the tumble dryer.",Riddick
184,mstyles-624-399356,Very good,9,11 July 2018,"I love the Riddick movies.. This bizarre planet, the creatures, the mysteriousness of Riddick and him narrating parts of it. They have their own brand of uniqueness, it has it's own environment, much like Startrek and Stargate, had their whole own universe..(I'm certainly not comparing this to above franchises. This one isn't as 'abstract' as the others. It kind of filled in our understanding of Riddick a bit more and the world he lives in.. There were some small bits of humor, and light-heartedness. Plenty of strong action, and violence. The supporting actors contributed also. Every once in a while, you get a hint, Riddick, might have some other powers, strengths, we are not aware of yet. If you liked the previous Riddick, this is more, slightly different, you won't be dis-appointed.. I hope Vin Diesel continues to make a couple more sequels..",Riddick

I really liked CoR and saw it a couple of times. I will NEVER see this movie again.Changing cannon, CGI dogs, actors not old enough to have kids a certain age, token tough blond girl, predictable plot, a deserted planet seen three times already and infuriating stupid characters are just a few highlights of this movie. It was like seeing a dumbed down version of Pitch Black.Also, it turns out that Riddick is so manly and badass that he cures lesbianism. So that happened.",Riddick

187,shashank-mishra2008,You can't get a better Sci-fi flick within 38 million $ of budget....,7,11 September 2013,"Riddick - RULE THE DARK I've been a fan of this film series since its inception. Pitch Black was, by all accounts, an interesting and different film. What otherwise should have been a modern cult classic in the making (on its own); turned out to gain a sequel in Chronicles Of Riddick. I wasn't completely fond of Chronicles, it seemed to me like an over the top expansion of a universe that we were seemingly interested in, and ended up not really wanting.THE BAD - The beginning of the film dragged on for a very long time. The writing was tenuous at various points of the film. To some degree, nonsensical dialogue tied to continuation of the story that had almost no purpose.THE GOOD - I was extremely interested in seeing Dave Bautista (Batista) in this film, because I wanted to see his acting ability prior to Guardians of the Galaxy. Bautista handled himself well overall,the few lines he had were relatively memorable & funny.Once the movie (actually) gets started, which is about 25-30 minutes in, you get immersed in what feels like a proper Pitch Black sequel, and that part of the film is fun, action packed, anxious, and filled with randomly interesting characters that help you understand Riddick out of context. And Vin Diesel was GREAT like always.IN ALL, A DECENT WATCH .",Riddick
188,svanlijnden,All Chronicled Out,6,6 February 2014,"When Pitch Black came out in 2000, it seemed like an unassuming, stand- alone horror-movie which borrowed heavily from Aliens, while adding enough uniqueness to the formula to make it interesting. It starred Vin Diesel as the not especially talkative Riddick, the enigmatic prisoner of a bounty-hunter. Stuck on a planet with a little group of people and swarms of deadly creatures, it was unclear if he was friend or foe to his companions. The movie became somewhat of a cult classic and I really liked it.However, writer/director David Twohey and lead actor Vin Diesel were not done with the character and his universe yet. The Chronicles of Riddick followed, once again plopping the titular character into captivity, but this time as part of an overblown, special-effects riddled space opera powered by what seemed like intergalactic Egyptians and metaphysical meanderings. It didn't do so well, but Twohey and Diesel persevered, using their own capital, so now there is a new chapter in the saga, simply called Riddick.Riddick – the movie – bookends itself by referencing Chronicles but seems to want to get back to its Alien-esque roots. It's divided into three distinct acts. The first is an overlong section about one man's survival on a hostile planet, the second one is a pretty standard action movie involving mercenaries, and the third one is a monster movie that apes Pitch Black but lacks tension and the element of surprise. Flowing throughout is some truly awful dialogue between the characters. They try – and miserably fail – to sound tough and cool. It's like they just filmed the first draft of a script, one that apes better sci-fi and action movies without understanding what actually made them work .Riddick – the character – gets less interesting the more we see of him. Cornball dialogue hurts his appeal and he just seems to be a bit of a dick, as well as creepy in seemingly unintended ways. Among the mercenaries is woman who is matter-of-factly established as a lesbian (played by Katee Sackhoff of Battlestar Galatica fame) but that doesn't stop Riddick from hitting on her and commenting on, among other things, the color of her nipples. (Don't ask.) Of course, this is also the kind of movie where he intrigues her and she flirts back, because in this macho fantasyland, all it takes to turn a lesbian straight, is to meet the right, über-butch guy. (Natch.)You'd hope the Riddick saga would end with this movie, but it doesn't. The final scenes set up yet another sequel that would head into space opera territory again. Twohey and Diesel seem determined to continue expanding their universe, even if it takes them decades and even if they have to self-fund the undertaking. So whether or not Riddick makes its money back, there may indeed be a sequel. You have to admire their dedication, even if it is hard to admire the final product.Ps: there is also duo of prequel video games named The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay and Assault on Dark Athena. Especially the first game received high marks from reviewers, so if you want more Riddick, you may be better off hunting down these games. Specifically the X-Box 360 version, which bundles them together.",Riddick
189,tortillachips-972-975637,Disappointed,6,18 May 2014,I am a true fan of the first two especially Chronicles of Riddick. The plot was good and great Sci-Fi action and visuals. The third one I thought perhaps a different director and screenwriter. I was shocked to learn the same. Movie basically same as first and the vulgar language and constant profanities!!! Totally not necessary. Very disappointed. The acting was not great. Was the nudity really needed? We got the point in the other films. The excessive violence I was a tad surprised of too. I thought if you make a trilogy you would follow the same them with how you show it. It could have been so much better. It didn't have the same feel at all. It felt to me like they rushed to make the film. I say the first two are Sci-Fi classics but this one. I am not sure.,Riddick
190,chrysoberylz,"Not So Good But Not a Bad Movie, Though",7,7 September 2013,"Well, I am not a really big fan of this Riddick series/franchise so I will just give my opinion about this one movie. The trailer first.. Yeah, the trailer is always awesome, because trailer is a form of promotional media which persuades us to watch the movie. It succeeded in persuading me to watch this movie.And honestly I am a bit disappointed. It is not as spectacular and amazing as The Chronicles of Riddick. It does not mean that this movie is that bad, I just think that this movie did not entertain me. I must admit that the visual is really good, the sound effect is thrilling, and the ""creatures"" are so awesome. But I think the story plot is flowing so slow in the first one hour. Honestly, although the visualization is good, the first one hour of this movie is really boring.I do not really recommend this movie. But if you are still curious, or maybe a big fan of this franchise, just watch it. I just give my opinion and my opinion is subjective, so you maybe think differently about this movie.",Riddick
191,superwomanproductions,Man Vs. Wild on Not Furya,8,12 September 2013,"I went into Riddick with a completely open mind. Knowing that it has been nine years since this character was seen in a movie, I was first thankful that Vin Diesel (love, love, love him) was the person to reprise the role that introduced him to movie goers. I was also thankful it was a continuation of the story of Riddick and not a reboot/remake of one of the previous stories or even a prequel. Seeing Riddick go back to his ""savage"" ways was an action packed experience and even coarse in some scenes. Even in moments when the special effects and creatures (c'mon now, isn't that what we loved most about ""Pitch Black""? Of course it needed to be done again after nine years) were what I considered to be a little overabundant, it was still fun. There were a few lines that the female character said that would've been more clever if said differently. But oh, well. Basically Riddick is a futuristic Man VS. Wild on a planet that is not Furya. Which to me is somewhat of an intentional pun. I'd give Riddick a nine, but I'm taking one point off for an overabundance of creatures and the unrealistic physics in one scene that made someone question the possibility of that situation actually ever being humanly possible. But it was still fun. Especially the brief glimpse of Vin Diesel's chiseled body in the nude. In fact, consider it a nine; I'm adding a point for that.",Riddick
192,veltonlishke,best riddick yet,8,16 September 2013,"I absolutely loved this film , this what Riddick should be about, back to basics unlike the second instalment this goes back to the pitch black style film but so much better, apparently done on a lot less budget it doesn't show, dark gloomy and brilliant, riddicks back to been his best with a hybrid dog type thing at his side.. thankfully not done in 3d as that would have ruined it for me I am actually considering going and watching this again this weekend which is something I have not done in a while if your looking for a dark violent sci fi then this is the one and I hope there are many more after this.....",Riddick
193,pierce-declase,Awesome movie,8,20 January 2014,"After around 8 years of no Riddick movies, finally the third film has arrived. This Sci-Fi film is amazing in many ways. If you love action than this is the film you will enjoy, from the get go you have action. Actually there is just action in the first opening 10 minutes of the film. Slowly it gets more into the story. Characters- The main character of course is Riddick who is as bad ass as ever! To those giant beast arms to those amazing glowing eyes. Typical riddick shows why he is the most wanted in the galaxy. Every time he is on the screen you will be enjoying it. As for most of the film. There is really no character development but who would want any when he already complete. Other characters are the 11 bounty hunters who comes after him. The most interesting one would be Dahl the only female character. I think she does well in her acting,credit goes to Katee Sackhoff. Boss Johns also is a very influential character in the movie, who also has a pass connected to Riddick. Out of everyone he would show the most character development. Story- The Story is pretty basic which suites the film. Though there is some aspects which have a larger meaning to it which will be interesting to see in future films, the main story is to get of this planet, well for riddick. There is really no twists in the story but none is needed. Action- Well what can you say, this film is full of action from Riddick killing wild animals, to slowly killing of the bounty hunters. This film has none stop action but does not bore you out. Some kills and specially one my favourite kills in whole of riddick. Overall this film is a must watched and very enjoyable film. Full of action and nice special affects. You will enjoy it from the start to the end. If you have not seen the Riddicks then i suggest watching 1 and 2 before watching this film but even if not, you will still understand what is going on. Very good movie.",Riddick
194,bravo-super,Cheap and low production,2,22 December 2013,"Several people of one wasteland with some scorpions. There is no scale, no struggle, there is no uniqueness. For a while it was shown a brief history of how Riddick ended up on this planet. The man who had a plan and could be a threat to Riddick has been modest man. Inserted is a servile sexuality unrelated to the story. Important object that is locked suddenly was left unlocked just like that. This film is far from true Chronicles of Riddick. This film is an insult to those expected for Riddick. Yes, sure profit is good, yes, probably so done to cash market expectations, but it is not a long-term strategy. Which means that from now, Riddick will be small dark theater.",Riddick

Riddick is better as an animal as told in the movie as he couldn't adapt himself with social people.Can be seen only for one time and some of Riddick's moves were predictable for those who have seen the other sequel, but some moves weren't predictable like killing other people when he had the chance to kill.Can other people comment whether he could kill all the monsters alone at the end of the movie and that he wouldn't have needed help.",Riddick
196,Emhilradim,"The third film, but seems vaguely familiar",8,25 September 2013,"As fans of the franchise, having played the games and watched the films, we went into the movie with expectations that it would fall victim to sequel lag where a third movie literally crawls its way from start to finish. Not entirely wrong, but definitely not right at all, the third film does a pretty good job. It felt Riddick, it felt good, and it was most definitely exciting. But if you were expecting something ""new"" then you're probably going to say ""what the hell was that?""Seemingly a blend of two parts Pitch Black, and one part Chronicles, we see a return of Richard B. Riddick. The film feels just like Pitch Black, and that's probably because it has almost the same plot behind it. Riddick is stuck on a desolately hellish world, and is being pursued by some mercenaries who decide that they want to try their hand at the Riddick grand slam. The catch, however, is that Riddick is valued higher dead than he is alive -- something we the audience know from the start, but Riddick doesn't until like the end of the movie.Just like in Pitch Black, things don't go according to plan, and we're thrust into another ""long darkness."" Now most of us who have seen Pitch Black start scratching our heads and wondering ""why would Vin Diesel do the same thing twice?"" You got me, but whatever, it works for the character I suppose.Sadly the film doesn't really go anywhere up until the last 40 minutes, and let's be honest, just like the first one it doesn't really go anywhere. It's a nice film if you weren't expecting much in the way of character growth, because we've already had Riddick defined for us in Pitch Black and just like in Chronicles of Riddick he doesn't really progress as a character. It's just Vin Diesel running around finding inventive ways to kill people and hostile creatures alike.So if you want something deep and meaningful, you should probably go see The Butler instead, but if you want to see something exciting and adrenaline filled then Riddick may be your cup of tea. It definitely pushed all of the boundaries of the R rating. But if you're going to watch it, you should probably watch the first two movies first so that you remember what the franchise is all about.",Riddick
197,mjconway1,Phoenix Rising!,7,6 September 2013,"PITCH BLACK was made for a relatively low budget and became a minor hit. Probably being overconfident, the producers made THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK for over 100 million dollars and it only grossed about half of that at the American box-office. The possibility of a 3rd movie looked bleak....If you've read the reports of on again off again, production shutdowns, securing a new budget, you would be excused for expecting the worst from the new RIDDICK movie. After CHRONICLES, they really had to pare the budget down. But, this is a labor of love for Vin Diesel (also producer) and writer/director, David Twohy. I'm happy to report that this movie is quite good! I just went to opening day, so I have to guess how this movie will fare. I suspect it will do very well, especially now that Riddick has been around on DVD, as a cartoon and as a video game or two. It's time for this series to go mainstream.The new movie is a true sequel, so it relies on some of the backstory, introduced in the first two live action movies. For the new viewer, you should first see PITCH BLACK. This introduces the ""prisoner,"" Riddick, who has eyes that can see in the dark, and his captor, a bounty hunter named Johns (Cole Houser).Next up, see THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK. This movie introduces a planet conquering race, the Necromongers (much akin to the Borg). These are the guys in the weird suits, in the new RIDDICK flashbacks. We also learn that Riddick belongs to a race, called Furyans - a bad-ass and defiant people! Now, that brings us to the third, live action installment, RIDDICK. Riddick is broken and stranded on a desolate planet. We are introduced to some alien species and rocky terrain. This is a ""hunter/prey"" movie with some pretty cool imagery. I'm not going to give much away - not that there is much to give away, but the pace is good and full of dark fun.I really have to give props for the production pulling through and giving us a movie that I think is somewhat better than CHRONICLES (which I actually like) and closer to the rawness of PITCH BLACK, even if it is self-derivative. It's a great piece of adventure/sci-fi to close out the summer with.",Riddick
198,jnaps098,Photocopy of the original...not inventive at all,6,11 September 2013,"This movie is way too similar to Pitch Black. Ironically this is simultaneously its strength and weakness. We are back on an inhabited planet where the local wildlife is going to turn things real ugly.I thoroughly enjoyed this ""returning to the roots"" approach. Overall it has a very simple premise like the original. It was like meeting an old friend and brought a smile to my face. I hadn't watched the trailer and was expecting space ships and planet hoping like the previous entry.There's familiar and then there's shot by shot copy, which is what the final act of the movie turns out to be (not be mention the creature design) and was the biggest disappointment for me. Worst, it didn't end in any gratifying way like Pitch Black. There could have been some redemption.From a production point of view, I thought the movie looked gorgeous, double so given its budget. It perfectly suited, perhaps even helped, the simple premise. Probably the biggest evidence of the low budget is the cast. Not a single performance is even worth mentioning. This is where I feel the original really shines in comparison. It had no star power but superb performances all around. You were interested in several characters, not just Riddick.Speaking of Riddick, this movie's more Vin Diesel playing Vin Diesel than Riddick. The movie starts off differently but quickly abandons the approach. Soon there is no situation that is even remotely challenging to our titular character. I don't think Dominic Toretto would have done things any different.Overall, the movie should be worth a watch for Riddick fans, perhaps more for Vin Diesel fans. I cant help but feel that the enjoyable bits of film work only because of the complete contrast brought in by the previous installment and not through merits on its own.",Riddick
199,interquam,Riddick: The complete Trilogy.,7,6 September 2013,"FINALLY!! Unlike prometheus Ridley Scott adds in a 100 more questions. David Twohy answers all questions.Nobody needs to be afraid of Riddick. Thats when he's gotta kill skittish people who are afraid of him and leave him for dead. Not the ones who see him in the eye. He hates it when people are afraid of him who eventually tried to get him killed.Katee Sackhoff as Dahl is a solid woman just like Sigourney as Ripley. She is a turn on and I don't really get turned on by looking at women. She even got riddick up! Riddick finally gets his own woman. Yipeee! She cant wait to mount him towards the end. Maybe in Riddick 4 he gets a son or a daughter. And neither can he resist himself to her sexuality and she to him. Mind you its not cheesy, teenagers crap who get emotional about losing virginity. Riddick is an animal who likes to mount his woman and likewise she wants him on spot, nothing less!Sackhoff for the most part of the movie is not shown to wear makeup like teenagers or in bling films where the pout looks overtly sexual. But they do. Without the makeup i couldn't take my eyes of her face. She is sexy to the core. And even riddick comments about her, well, teats.Its a basic rule or fact. Most wrestlers are hardcore actors. Bautista is a testament. I wouldn't be surprised if they start taking more wrestlers. Also their persona and girth leave nothing for anybody. Riddick looks like a match stick in front of him. And No i don't mean body mass, instead dialogue delivery and the ability to hold the camera.David twohy starts off by Riddick being left for dead on a destroyed world by necromongers. Its unclear what the world really is because he finds a golf ball given to him by his pet 'dog' who he raised as a pup.The necromongers told him the world is Furya. Its not. So he summons for contact by activating a beacon. Mercs rush in followed by 'cops' if my guess is correct. They technically are not keepers of the law. In space there is no law. These new guys mostly even off or collect bounties for people on a wanted list. This movie also shows Riddick's basic need for human contact and companionship. Its something he understands more than anyone else and the fact that his life depends on help by others when he needs it.One of the 'cops' is big daddy Johns. Yes you guessed it right, he is john's father from pitch black. Unlike his junkie son, he and Riddick meet eye to eye. The movies ends with them as comrades and Big johns gives him his own ship, well the ship is that of the mercs who want Riddick's head. So at the end he leaves for Furya and tells Big Johns he's heading home. A new story starts.THe best part being Katee Sackhoff who approved of Riddick as a mate in the human animal kingdom. She wanted and couldn't wait to mount him. Nuff said! Go watch.I hope the 4th part comes up with not only survival skills but uncanny ability to control human minds and not just situations.",Riddick
200,FurianXO,Very disappointed,4,21 September 2013,"I am a huge Riddick fan, but this movie doesn't make the cut. It is basically a bad version of the first movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed. It's very disappointing to wait almost 10 years for another one, only to be presented with this.The entire movie takes place on one planet, and basically boils down to Riddick killing the bad guys, then all of them trying to survive the alien lifeforms on the planet. The second movie completely blows this one away in every way. There is space travel, the evil religion element, planet conquering, prisons, prison escapes, former characters, lord marshal killing, etc... This movie has none of that... almost the entire movie is basically filmed around one little outpost.",Riddick
201,james_scott_mcs,More Pitch Black than Chronicles of Riddick,8,17 March 2015,"Probably my 2nd favorite of the Riddick movies. It's hard to compete with the great sleeper hit Pitch Black. And I personally thought Chronicles of Riddick too effects heavy, even though it had some great scenes and lines. And the whole ""you are the last of your race, species, tribe that is destined for greatness"", was so played out in Highlander2, Scorpion King, etc. This movie takes off right where the last one ended. The Necromongers are shown at the beginning, but then are quickly shoved aside for we really want. Riddick kicking butt against unsurmountable odds. One man versus a group of Mercs while a impending certain everyone dies timeline is a great throwback to Pitch Black. I really hope that David Twohy writes another Riddick Movie. If you loved Pitch Black, you'll this movie. Acting- 8 out of 10 (not much to complain about, everyone is believable in their roles). Directing/cinematography- 9 out of 10 (has the same feel as Pitch Black and Chronicles) Story- 7 out of 10 (great story, but major plots are way to obvious/predicable) Special effects - 9 out of 10 (the alien creatures and world are believable.

Watched Mad Max II the other day, same deal, pet dingo. Pathetic. It's not as if the world needs more callous animal hating dicks is it? If a human character shows loyalty they often get to survive because this is seen as a positive attribute... not for animals the only reason that bond is shown forming is so they can sacrifice themselves to save their ""masters"".It's bad enough that humans treat animals like crap it real life without it happening in fiction too...This film was ruined by that scene and made me angry.

203,extcontact,Abandoning Chronicles to remake Pitch Black,2,6 September 2013,"Chronicles thoroughly abandoned Pitch Black, but was forgiven for executing well on Chronicle's expansive new playing field. So it's now utterly bewildering why Twohy and Diesel now abandon the inherent opportunities of that richly-appointed stage in order to serve up a predictable and boring reprise of Pitch Black when so much potential loomed out there in the darkness. And why? We've already seen this movie. Was it a lack of budget? A lack of the creative vision necessary to follow through on Chronicles? I am personally left thinking it must be the former, but still, why circle back to kill a horse you've already left for dead in the first movie? It makes no sense, feels like clumsy thematic lurching, and represents the wasting of an opportunity which doesn't come along every day. So from where I sit, we (Twohy, Diesel, and us fans) all lose out in this weak offering. I wanted so much more from this movie and instead left the theater just as parched and starving as one surely would if marooned on a deserted planet bereft of all hope.",Riddick

Not sure on the title..... the movie however I am sure on..... Riddick is a really good movie.Riddick takes place sometime after ""Chronicles Of Riddick"" and Riddick, after being stabbed in the back by the Necromongers how claimed him new king he finds himself trapped again on an isolated plant with some pretty nasty natives to keep him company.The first 10-15 minuets of the movie lost me a little..... mostly silence with Riddick facing off against several of the native creatures. He then starts a very touching friendship with a native K9. after discovering a storm on the horizon (containing snakelike scorpion creatures) he decides its a good time to activate the help beacon (in some interstellar truck stop??) and two teams of Mercs come looking for him, one looking for his head and the other looking for answers....... Will either of them get what they want before the storm hit (DAH DA DAH DAH DAAAAHHHHHHH)I really like this movie! but the next few line are really going to sound like i didn't... but i really did...... Riddick almost felt like a little bit of a step back.... as when you see this you will undoubtedly be reminded of the original in the series, Pitch Black, but without the feeling of isolation and at times claustrophobia I would like to see s sequel to this movie... but would i just be watching Chronicles again? Which makes me think this could be the last in the Riddick in the series.....I would of course like to see more of the universe that the series is set in but not at risk of pure repetitions and pointless sequels.To summarise, Riddick is not the direction i expected the series to go in after watching ""Chronicles"" as i expected more exploration of the universe that the second in the series opened up. It in fact goes back to the original movie in the series... Less of a part 3 and more of a part one part 2......... But i liked it!Peace and Afrogrease IMDb",Riddick
205,Tab132,Riddickulous,5,6 September 2013,"okay so i saw pitch black and chronicles probably when i was around 10 and 13 respectively. i saw them both once and i thought they were fine, nothing special. but still after chronicles i never expected them to make a sequel, and now riddick's here after about a decade. the short version : it's dumb as hell. starts out with a tie in with chronicles, diesels become the king of a empire and he instantly gets betrayed and kicked off a cliff in a deserted alien-infested planet. diesel proceeds to hit random animals in the head with a club for about a half hour until bounty hunters show up. he jacks some vital ship components than buries them. then just walks up to the hunters trying to negotiate, and he gets captured. a rain storm hits and pitchblack-type creatures appear and so they have to go grab the components. that's pretty much the entire movie. the dialog is garbage, complete with a crap narration from vin diesel. it relies heavily on cgi so all of the creatures look cartoonish, most of the action is humans killing said creatures which leads to an abundance of cgi blood and gore. the acting is pretty solid considering the material, and i will have to admit i didn't think the movie was boring. it's just not worth the $12.50 price of admission, hell i wouldn't even recommend it on cable unless your a huge fan of the first two. it's laughable at best.",Riddick
206,vamsynkrishna,"A complete let down, albeit.....",6,14 September 2013,"Albeit a good presentation of monsters and different planets with great CGI affects; the movie was a complete let down, compared to its prequels.There is no story, but pretends to be, and actually is just an extension of the conceived concept. Maybe, it bridges the gap between the prequel and the sequel, if there is ever going to be!You would enjoy the character Riddick, but not much of an appealing he is when compared to the prior releases. The audience are assumed to be the followers of The Riddick series movies. So, you can't completely feel of what Riddick is capable of, and how it distinguishes him as the lead character!If you have to know about Riddick, you should have watched or watch now the first two releases in the series.So, in my opine, this release is a let down for the series and will definitely disappoint much of the Riddick fans!",Riddick
207,rudy70,Riddick returns.,8,27 June 2019,I recently watched the unrated version on blue ray and really enjoyed the added scenes and way better ending than the theater cut. The film is right and the action is fast and crisp. The only negative is there is a little too much swearing.,Riddick
208,senderik,Enjoyable 80s style action,8,24 September 2013,"Vin Diesel clearly wants to be seen as the baddest ass of them all. The result is a fun filled action movie that anyone who likes the 80s action heroes like Schwarzenegger and Willis can enjoy. Sure the story is a rehash of Pitch Black but it is done in a great way and shows that Hollywood mainstream should pay attention and does not only have to bring out endless streams of CGI drivel to make a buck or two. With a bigger budget the story could have been expanded which is a bit of a shame. I kept expecting Riddick to find a hidden city underground or some other form of civilization but with the money Diesel will make from this movie, he should be able to continue the Chronicles beyond escaping monsters and mercenaries.",Riddick
209,platomd,Riddick: scifi the way it should be,8,16 September 2013,"Riddick is an iconic character played by Van Diesel in three movies: Pitch Black, the Chronicles of Riddick and the newest installment Riddick- Into the Dark. Van Diesel recreates his version of Riddick 9 years after the last chapter was released. Left for dead on a planet with no name, the anti-hero of this film has two needs: vengeance and survival. With an interesting array of alien creatures desiring to kill our protagonist in nearly every scene, you may not want to take a break to the candy stand. A wanted criminal in half the galaxy, bounty hunters seem to find him no matter where he is. Riddick is able to outwit the lowlife and the more advanced animals chasing him, to his own advantage. Small hints of nontraditional sexual roles are sprinkled throughout Riddick's negotiations with his potential captors. Background sets flesh out the harsh reality Riddick must contend with to survive. Into the Dark is more reminiscent of the first movie Pitch Black than its sequel. David Twohy wrote and directed this latest chapter of Riddick, allowing his imagine to move as far as the set designers would permit. In the event you are searching for pure scifi, such as a Star Wars adventure, this is not the movie for you. Ingenuity is embedded in this well written script, loaded with twists and turns, to keep the audience on edge. Twohy has the so-called good guys and gal desperately searching for our anti-hero, who is not very far away. For hardcore science fiction addicts, who rebuff the dilute and worn out nature of the Star Trek series, this movie was created for you. Van Diesel, no stranger to sequels, would do himself and the audience an injustice if he did not develop this character any further. I suggest there may be several sequels to follow. Running time is approximately 2 hours and worth the watch. Mark Davis MD, your intrepid reviewer at large. For comments: twitter.com/americassage or americassage@gmail.com",Riddick
210,johreh,Not what I expected,3,18 January 2014,"Some minor spoilers! Let me first tell you what this installment of Riddick IS NOT: ""Look, I am not with everyone here, but I will take a piece of him."" Fans of this franchise know what happens then, why it happens and the context and story in which it happens.In Riddick, Riddick wants to find Furya. He bargains with Vaako who has the map to Furya inside his head. Riddick is transported to a planet which is Not Furya and killed (or so they think). He survives, becomes friend with a kind of a dog and then finds a shack with seems to be a mercenary hideout. He activates the beacon and two different mercenary parties land on the planet to find Riddick.It starts to rain and out comes some really nasty monsters, going after everyone in and around the shack.Riddick is not a complete waste of time as there are some cool action scenes, but nothing you haven't seen before. To a certain extent, this movie is a repeat of Pitch Black. I had hoped for something else. Something to add on to Pitch Black and The Chronicles. But there is not depth to the story and after a while it gets boring which is definitely nothing you want to realize when watching a Riddick movie.If this movie was an effort to build on the franchise, they failed. If this movie was an effort to produce some good action, I guess it was not a complete failure, but as a fan of Riddick, this movie was unnecessary. It would have been so easy to build in a little depth and perhaps a twist. What about the golf ball the dog found. That was never explained.I liked the equipment the mercenaries had...it was kind of cool. I have read reviews saying their equipment was way behind the technological curve as they have interstellar space travel. That might be true, but I still think the equipment was cool.Overall, this movie could have been, and should have been, much better as Riddick and the audience so deserve.",Riddick
211,Matt_bobco,A bloated collection of mediocrity - watch Pitch Black instead,3,2 January 2020,"This was a missed opportunity that resulted in a bloated movie impressed with itself for no good reason and which barely rises above mediocre.The plot is broadly serviceable - as you would expect, since it is identical in all meaningful ways to the surprisingly good Pitch Black.
The increased budget made for a better looking movie but the production team seem to have confused quantity for quality. There are some interesting monsters, some nice industrial design, the lighting is pretty good, and the cinematography is adequate. But there is just too much movie with nothing to say and nothing to show us. Lots of things happen, and they sometimes look great, but it all comes off feeling shallow and boring.The acting is mostly atrocious, and the script somehow even worse than I expected, but undermining everything is some truly terrible editing and pacing. Action scenes, such as they are, play for a few minutes before the movie grinds to a halt. Then we are subjected to another exchange of poorly written and delivered chatter, or scenes of actors standing around looking meaningfully at things. Fully half of its runtime could be cut without losing anything important.Ultimately this is a bloated, tedious, poorly made, but no doubt expensive waste of time. If you like the premise, just watch Pitch Black instead.",Riddick

213,imdb-neweyes,"Same formula, some plot holes but watchable",6,12 April 2016,"To be frank, I like this movie much better than Pitch Black. The reason is, that I find the characters much more interesting.I never liked the young Jones in Pitch Black. The new villain Santana and the older Jones are much more interesting. I even like Dahl. The other characters are the standard typical Mercs (with one exception, though also not interesting either -- every Riddick movie needs a religious man, it seams) ... nothing to remember here.The story, to be frank is basically a copy of Pitch Black with some different CGI. Maybe they thought, that if it worked once, let it do the job twice. The plot is simply rather dull and predictable from the beginning. Even the ending is very disappointing (I read somewhere, that the directors cut version shall give a little more ... but not much).Some plot holes are there also - for example two ships with top SciFi-equipment that shall detect any movement, but Riddick seams to be able to move without detection everywhere ... no hinting, why or how. Again Riddick is just without physical limits ... for me, a little to implausible, but who cares ...At least some cool lines and watchable interactions between the people -- I found it more interesting than Pitch Black.",Riddick
214,Prophet89,Painfully disappointing,4,30 January 2014,"The first I watched was The Chronicles - thought of it as a quite good SF/Fantasy watch, even though there were some ridiculousness' here and there, and that the plot felt like it was a part of some bigger universe with wide lore and stuff, like it assumed that the viewer will just know some wider aspects of the story. Then I watched Pitch Black which was one of the best, non-expensive (because it wasn't just cheap) SF flicks I've seen. Then played the games, which were also quite good all things considered. I am a big fan a the genre - seen hundreds of such films.And then 'Riddick' came by, loudly announcing it's arrival, having a trendy, seductive trailer and all. It's not gonna be long, folks, the movie is just really, really poor. The main problem is it's script - it's just like it was written by some fifteen year old, Luc Besson wannabe, who never wrote anything else. The other things are like: some bits of good acting, by Diesel mainly, the rest is quite dull, some less-than-decent CGI for such a budget, plot that's almost exactly copied off the first movie but not in the good way, and some of the cheesiest dialogues I've heard in a movie. Quite good pictures and editing though. Oh, and the soundtrack is almost non-existent, and the scenography seems like it was left for the end and the film's budget ran out while the decorations, costumes and props were still being developed.On the last note, I am surprised the movie didn't catch any attention of LGBT, for depicting a lesbian in a tribute-to-the-'80s manner. Probably because it didn't catch that much of attention at all.Seriously, for me it only lowered my overall feelings about this whole range of titles set in that universe.",Riddick

I watched it on bluray in 5.1...and even if it starts slow slow....the movie is 1h.50mn so not a problem... Anyway the story is weak, but who cares, Vin diesel is incredible as riddick! probably the best act of his career! Action is not so intense, but the ambiance of the whole planet is what makes it amazing, and the attitude of the hero.I really don't understand why this movie did not have a better success! but thank god Vin diesel made it using much less money than the previous one;so box office was positive and riddick 4 & 5 will be planned!!!

217,jerzykunce32,a complete disaster,2,8 December 2013,"I'm really amazed by such high ranking of this film. If it deserves at all for a name of a film, because film should have something called plot and should be played by people called actors. It starts like a fairy- tale and ends like the some low-budget commercial. It seems that Riddick was a king of some Necro-civilization, but he left his kingdom to find a planet called furya. Of course there is no explanation why. Who would ask at all ? He is betrayed by his guide and left on some planet which is similar to Texas, where he adopts a dog and trains it a while. He even managed to kill the main predator-species on this planet - a sort of an eel and scorpion in one (the effects are like on PC ten years ago). He leads this interesting hunter-trapper life, but unfortunately on this desert planet the clouds are gathering - the storm is coming. So he travels to find a kind of shed (where did it come from?), equipped with beacon and sends a signal into space to make someone come to him and get him a ship. Of course it takes only few hours and at least 2 ships arrive ! The one contain a group of marauders with Russian accent, the second a father of someone from the past of our hero (no explanation who he was and what is it about). The rest is typical (i will reveal that they kill the dog !!!) - but completely deprived of suspense and sens too. The ending is so stupid that i can't find the words for it. Just leave this absurd alone - because it is not a film but a series of moving pictures - even first horror in the history - without sound and color is better - watch Nosferatu of Murnau from 1922 instead of this nonsense.",Riddick

It was all pretty much been done before it all the other movies about Riddick (The third movie is the best in the series in my opinion) . It seemed to have really slow build up also to fighting the monsters at the end. I ended up feeling tired in the middle of it & had to stop watching it to have a nap and then continued watching it again later. I was really hoping for something that would make this movie unique and didn't find much, Although I did like the relationship he had with the Dog at the beginning of the movie that was a nice touch.",Riddick

220,emil-karajic,Good sci-fi but feels to much like a Pitch Black Riddick reboot,8,11 January 2014,"Loved the movie because I'm a big Riddick fan, but lets be honest - this movie is just a bad Pitch Black remake with a bigger budget. The movie is a bit too long, it drags at some segments and the pacing is way off. The plot is predictable and at some points over the top cheesy. As far as the storyline goes the movie feels like a step back and lack overall progression over the the trilogy. it basically feels like a reboot. The biggest disappointment was Karl Urban SPOILER who is in this movie for like 5 seconds!!! but they still plaster his name all over the posters, trailers and credits - thats just low and dirty marketing!Other than that it is a very enjoyable sci-fi movie with kick ass Vin Diesel.

""Riddick"" though is IMHO the movie to avoid, as it brings nothing new to the table. Honestly, when I look at it now, I have a feeling that the the facts important for the story development could be described in just one sentence... and maybe 1 minute long video. Maybe it's only me, but I expect more from the movie than just pretentious (to not say - silly) voice and shining eyes. And one-liners delivered by Vin in ""Riddick"" define new level of crap. When I heard what he had to say about the only representative of the women in the movie, then I simply couldn't believe - was he desperately trying to prove that he has a sexual attraction to an opposite sex? :) How pathetic!",Riddick

What else do we have here?The third installment of the series, simply called ""Riddick"", starts with an impressive planet full of atrocities and nasty beasts. Cinematography looks fine, as do the alien creatures. Riddick fights for survival on a planet that seemingly tries to suppress his attempts. Now and then, we catch glimpses at the past and at the Necromongers who betrayed our beloved antihero. After half an hour or so, we meet some extremely 'nice' mercenaries who, to our surprise, ahem, find their way to said planet and try to hunt down Riddick. They are not aware, however, of the extreme violence radiating off the planet. Besides, what or who could be more dangerous than Riddick cut loose?If you feel reminded of ""Pitch Black"", it may have to do with the somehow similar story. If you liked ""Pitch Black"", you will most probably enjoy ""Riddick"" as well, to a certain degree at least. I, personally, would have preferred a smarter pacing during the whole merc-scenes. They seemed a bit lengthy at times. I would also have wished for some answers considering the second movie. I had expected more scenes with Vaako (Karl Urban). It was okay, though. It's still Riddick, isn't it?It's still fun and I'm still looking forward to the next Riddick movie.",Riddick
223,bonniedarko57,Riddick Not Even on the Same Planet as Pitch Black!!,4,9 September 2013,"The newest addition to the sci-fi, thriller Pitch Black (2000) franchise was released this past Friday. I was fairly excited for the return of nocturnal renegade, Richard B. Riddick, played by Vin Diesel. Sorry to say, the movie just made me want to gauge my own eyes out instead of cheering for the silver-eyed brute. Too much time was spent in the beginning developing a fluff, man and his dog motif, and just like Will Smith and his companion in I Am Legend, the dog ends up like every black guy in horror movies.Riddick struggles with the same obstacles, trying to survive a new planet through unrealistic, choreographed knife scenes and the worst pick-up lines you'll ever hear.""I like your toes...they match your nip----."" I find it shocking that movie-goers have banned together in order to rank Riddick as a 60 percent-er on Rotten Tomatoes. I understand the nostalgia one must feel imagining this film as original as the first, but mass delusions have been known to happen.",Riddick

It seemed unnecessary. How critics rated this above pitch black and chronicles is beyond me. This is easily the worst out of the trilogy. Some of the dialog is dry and cheesy. The CGI has its good moments and bad moments. I appreciate them using special fx and not CGI in some areas.It left more questions than it answered. I really enjoyed the first 45 minutes of the film. Then it felt like it dragged. Didn't really have a solid plot. Solid C+",Riddick

I'm aware that there is always a lot of silliness and bravado in there, but that's all part of the fun and charm.However, Riddick left me completely and utterly gutted. It didn't really go anywhere, it was badly executed, plot holes reigned supreme and more than anything we didn't really get to see Riddick do all that much.This is a childish film that I suspect will only appeal to simpletons I'm afraid. If it hadn't been Riddick (and I wasn't with a friend that was also desperate to see it) it's one of the few films that I would probably have walked out of because I genuinely had better things to do!",Riddick
226,Clyph10,Riddick review (never seen Pitch Black or Chronicles of Riddick),6,7 September 2013,"Reminder: I've never seen Pitch Black and/or Chronicles of Riddick, other than the ending, which is summarized in this third installment. Throughout the whole movie, it seems like I was saying to myself ""how did that happen?"" It seems no matter where they go, Riddick (Vin Diesel) stalks the bounty hunters like a bunch of blind mice. Constantly, Riddick somehow sneaks into the mercenary base (never shows how), goes inside and taunts all the hunters, whether its stealing huge batteries to the aircrafts from a safe they just so happened to leave unlocked for a second, or jamming the gigantic tracking device that has full view of everything around it. In the beginning, he's tricked and becomes stranded on some random deserted desert planet, not knowing what or were anything is. There's only 2 creatures in the WHOLE movie, other than the vulture thing in the intro. After fighting off one of the species, a big, cheetah like dingo, he finds a cub and raises him as a pet, which wasn't too bad, just reminded me a little too much of Mad Max (loner + desert + dingo buddy). The other creature, some type of land/water scorpion, was the main and only creature he kills throughout the whole movie. One characteristic I rather enjoyed is how the creatures would migrate with the rain, using little puddles or ponds as an advantage. 2 teams of bounty hunters fly in; one sloppy, raggedy team with the worst leader I've seen, and a clean, goody-good marine type. Here's the 2 elements of the movie that really stirred me the wrong way. First off, half way through, Riddick and the mercenaries have a little negotiation over the batteries. Riddick walks casually towards the base all BA and talks to the mercenaries face to face with no weapons, until Captain Raggedy disturbs the peace and the leaves the dingo dead. Riddick is then paralyzed and taken prisoner. The main problem for me was when Captain Johns, leader of the marine group, confronts Riddick about his son's death. Riddick claims that he didn't kill his son (from Pitch Black I'm assuming), instead explains how he OD on heroin. Johns says his son would never do anything like that. Yet from that point on, him and Riddick have a little bro-love going on. Riddick is left fighting off the scorpion things and the remaining 3 hunters, one of which is the biggest pussies I've seen, acquire the batteries and fly off. Before Riddick gets diced up, Johns bombs the battle ground and picks up his bud Riddick so they can live happily ever after...... What a load of horse crap. Anyone who's not acquainted with the Riddick films, or anyone in general, will find this film to be a waste of time. Animation is cheap and there's constant, none-desirable humor throughout. This movie was literally ""Riddickulous"". 1.5*/4",Riddick

I wanted to see more of the into part of the film with Carl Urban and the necros or rather I would of preferred the movie to exist in that atmosphere and not the planet(been there done that). The fight scenes and cgi were all amazing. I like Vin as the anti hero and Riddicks fighting skills, but there really was no point to remake the first movie and called it a third chapter. I want to see more of Riddick as king of the necromancers- that would be more interesting then this. I liked seeing Katee Sackhoff again but, she was fun to see but her role was too minor in my opinion. I wish the she would of filled the role of John instead and could have been a sister rather then father of little john. Like Joss Whedon Strong Female leads, I wish she would of had a larger part here, or like Claudia Black in the first movie.",Riddick

First of all. He got stuck on a planet where during a very certain rare event on the planet, a group of killer aliens appear. I mean come on. Someone actually got paid because ""he/she came up with this idea"".
15 minutes into the movie there were at least 10 dramatic close up on Riddick's face, and eyes.

Plenty of cheesy one-liners and good action scenes set in a sci-fi world.The story wasn't anything spectacular, no breaking new ground here but it does set the stage for the next (hope we get a next!!!!). Graphics were well-done, alien life wasn't anything unique but were suitably scary.If you liked the 1st and/or 2nd film you'll enjoy this. It pays more homage to the 1st than the 2nd.

230,steven-958-904210,Disappointing,4,20 January 2014,"Jeez, I really liked Chronicles, it had a good mix of stuff going on, and the story line was kind of believable.. Riddick's role was cool and you felt he was a winner and you backed him all the way. This story is too disjointed, it kind of makes a half ass attempt to carry on from Chronicle but it doesn't work. There is some suspense, some good CGI and there are some good moments, but it could have been much much better. On the whole, too predictable, too convenient and a generally weak story line. The whole thing about the space ships and locking the battery away and then hiding it and going to get it again was so tedious. He should have just killed them all and gone home, that would have been a more interesting story. The ending was diabolical.",Riddick
231,revenant83,Should Be Called 'Ridic',3,1 October 2013,"The production values were pretty high, the FX and sound we're good/decent, and some of the supporting acting was not bad.The most enjoyment I got from this film was the 2 hours my friend and I spent ridiculing it afterward as one of the worst movies we'd ever watched. Taking itself much too seriously for what it was, there was almost no redeeming value. The script, Vin Diesel acting, and plot were harrowing. I can suspend a great deal of disbelief, but at some point things just jump the shark, so to speak, and that happened about 10 minutes into this meandering monstrosity -- and it only got worse from there. From a planet inhabited only by apex predators, with no prey to be found, to meaningless ""supporting"" characters, to an implausible and ridiculously convoluted plot, this film left a lot to be desired. Riddick's exile to a barren world -- never fully explained to the satisfaction of any rational thinker -- was both implausible and virtually impossible. Why would he sacrifice his position as some sort of emperor (of what?!?) to find his home world? Why would his adversaries bother with landing him on a planet that wasn't his home world to begin with? Why not either kill him outright or else take him to his actual home world? Why did he stay put behind a rock when the ground was shaking from under him? How did he survive a 1000+ ft fall? None of these questions were answered to any satisfaction, nor was there much of an attempt to do so. Suffice it to say, he's on a stark and mostly barren planet because he is.This film could have been so much better that it was. It was almost written like a good kid/tween flick, but it had far too much profanity and gore for most youngsters, and I say that as someone who is not afraid to drop an F bomb in front of my own kids, or someone who tries to shelter them from the reality of the world. This did not depict reality as anyone knows it, nor was it a good escape.In a face palm of an ending, we're essentially given the message that lesbians can be turned straight when exposed to a high enough dose of machismo, which is insulting to both lesbians, and frankly to meatheads. Vin Diesel might make character driven films, but that doesn't mean the material needs to be idiotic either. There is a middle ground.All in all, I can't recommend that anyone spend time or money watching this movie for any reason other than cheap thrills and/or to laugh at it. I can only assume that most people who aren't devoted to action flicks didn't watch this, because I can't think of any other way this movie could get such relatively high ratings. Definitely the worst in the series, and a sore disappointment.",Riddick

In fact, Riddick expands what was basically a 5 minute sequence at the start of Chronicles--namely Riddick stranded on a (frozen) planet and escaping using the bounty hunter's ship into a two hour bloated yawner. Nuff said. Riddick does not advance the plot/saga in any substantial way. The first third of the movie with its Robinson Crusoe riffs was easily the best part of the two hour runtime. But the movie is utterly ruined with the arrival of the bounty hunters. After nearly 80 minutes of running around there is no closure at all. The one character who is villainous was dispatched spectacularly. But that sequence was included in the very first trailer for the film!!! When the money shot is in the trailer and in the film it occurs with 20 minutes left, there is no place for the movie to go but down and fast.The creatures are nasty for sure ... are they in the caverns below the surface or are they in a dehydrated state? Should we care? They show up in vast numbers and then not at all and then again in an inconsistent manner (Pitch Black did not suffer from these sort of inconsistencies). They are unable to eliminate one character who makes it back unaided to ensure that the Riddick saga continues! This is a huge plot hole (maybe they will make a movie out of that...)An unfortunate attempt to introduce element of sexual tension in the film fails utterly. Riddick's declaration of lust for the one surviving female character is spectacularly at odds with the internal dynamic of the story and of Riddick's own character development to this point in the saga. If you want argue that this is simply lust at first sight, how can it NOT be anything less than objectification of a beautiful woman? My thinking is that the film has undergone significant trimming and reorientation during the editing process. There is probably more story and additional advancement of the plot involving the necros left on the cutting room floor. There must have also been more scenes between Riddick and Dahl to justify Riddick's subsequent declaration of his intentions for her. Its number one at the box-office. The bad news is that for people like me who demand story/tension/internal logic and some originality, this bodes ill since the movie's success vindicates what I detest in this film. The good news is it portends installments 4 and 5. Apparently the creators have already plotted out the trajectory of the next films in the saga. Hopefully no rip-offs are in the offing....",Riddick

234,alexander-khalkho,Get Rid of this movie,1,8 November 2013,"I just hope this movie had not been made. I had wished for a Pitch Black movie sequel since I saw it. Pitch Black had a great plot. A group of people crash landing on a planet, alien monsters and double faced characters and the execution was awesome. My wish was granted with Chronicles of Riddick, but it was in a completely different direction. The world of Pitch Black was explored and less of the intensity of the original was there.Riddick was the sequel that I wanted, but not like this. All the elements were the same as the original. But the execution was poor. The tension of being stuck in a planet, similar to the original movie, was not there. The characters were dumb. The action was not enough and the special effects were pathetic.All I could say is that, being a huge pitch black fan, i was totally disappointed with this one.",Riddick
235,Silverleafs,Anticipated and it was all awesome till...,5,11 September 2013,"... they killed Riddicks partner. No matter what the species. Portraying the murder of protecting domesticated is such a big turn off.The movie starts slow with an unneeded softy partnership. The graphics & industrial design (artwork) is mighty fine. The smart interactions start to fail when the human nature starts to corrupt the storyline.The writers have tried combining all the best elements from the previous movies into this one and utterly failed to mesmerize the end result. You can walk out of the cinema impressed only by the high quality if graphics.It is Riddick without the ""raw furyan"" mystique.Karl Urban outshines the cast in absence.",Riddick
236,docnova-264-364862,Disappointing Third.,5,2 January 2014,"I was so looking forward to this release. 'Pitch Black' was original and 'Chronicles' was a superb follow up and is one of my favourite syfy movies of all time. When 'Chronicles' didn't quite make back its budget at the box office, I thought it would be shelved forever but the DVD sales were impressive afterwards and has placed the movie into cult status. So of course I was delighted that a third film went into production. From the beginning, we were all aware that the budget was significantly reduced and the story would be based around a 'Pitch Black' scenario - trapped on a planet and alien creatures. So I wasn't expecting the gloss of 'Chronicles' but still be on par with 'Pitch'.I must admit, the first 30 minutes were very entertaining until the moment he adopts Pluto. And when the 2 groups of mercs landed, the film fell into the vortex of stupidity. Then the ending where Johns has a change of heart and rescues our antihero, the franchise has run its course in my eyes.I will still give the movie 5 stars. Vin Diesel does right by Riddick and my main complaint is the script. The reduced budget did effect the CGI in some parts and made it like a 90's movie but the script just fell to pieces.",Riddick
237,geolot1256,"""Riddick"" as Pitch Black part 2 instead of Chronicles part 2",7,15 September 2013,"I really liked Pitch Black but loved Chronicles of Riddick. I was hoping a sequel would be made to that storyline and sadly ""Riddick"" isn't it, but it's still a fun movie. I had heard that Chronicles wasn't received well and I can't relate to why that is. It was in my top 5 scifi movies of all time. I loved the whole necromonger concept and Riddick's part to play in that saga. I know that a sequel to that story-line would be expensive and easy to screw up, so we get a film like ""Riddick"" instead. How I would describe ""Riddick"" is like maybe a polished version of Pitch Black (which isn't a bad thing) with a very quick tie-in to the necromonger story-line. Riddick didn't really advance the story-line much at all, but gave us another glimpse at him and kind of reinforced his amazing skills and intelligence. The Tie-in with his former bounty-hunter nemesis John from Pitchblack was pretty good since it was a bit more than one-dimensional vendetta that you might normally see. The new Johns (Pitch Black John's father) seemed more thoughtful than his son and began to perhaps respect Riddick a little bit after their discussion about his son and after Riddick saved him during the ride to the buried power cells, and certainly after their hand fight with the creatures where it was plain that Riddick saved Johns Sr from one of the creatures before Riddick had become injured.Riddick said earlier to the bounty hunters that he ""liked to be a man of his word"" and I think that Johns Sr must have seen the truth in that. They seemed to part maybe not as allies, but at least with a good understanding of each other. Riddick perhaps becomes a bit more human when he says that everyone needs to go home at some point. What I got from this is that he wants to find his home planet of Furyia and perhaps after that, he may be able to start building a normal life for himself...I hope for a sequel that continues from there and reunites him with the necromongers... obviously revenge would be on his mind. Oh, and the underverse is too interesting to leave unexplored.",Riddick
238,nacho-iyaam,The Riddick franchise is officially dead,2,4 January 2014,"Like many others here, I loved Pitch Black and thought Chronicles was a fairly decent movie. So, I had high hopes for this.They go with the quite common ""How did I end up here?"" opening. It's a little slow but pretty promising. But it's all downhill from there.A lot of people were complaining about the bad Visual FX, but I thought it was pretty decent.My main complaints stem from a complete lack of storyline. It felt like a poorly written Straight to TV remake of Pitch Black. It felt like there were no characters in there apart from Riddick - just generic extras that happened to have a lot of screen time. Even Riddick's character was just a generic Anti-hero lead role.None of the events seemed like they were character driven. There was nothing really there to explain how the events panned out. The only thing you take away is that Riddick is an incredibly lucky guy.Then there's the dialog. That was just a collection of bad one-liners. Some of them incredibly bad!So, to describe this movie as anything other than a waste of time and money is pretty much a lie.There, you have it!",Riddick
239,Jack_Slater,"Alone in the dark, where the demons are torturing me.",4,8 September 2013,"This movie is utter dreck.Vin Diesel does a sub-par Bear Grylls impression for the first act. We then need to endure two teams of muscle-bound mercs spout rejected clichés from 'The Expendables' for the second act. With an Xbox-style ""if it moves, shoot it; if it doesn't move, shoot it anyway"" battle to finish this most unnecessary of sequels since the last outing of Riddick.Did nobody realise the most interesting aspect of 'Pitch Black' was *not* actually Riddick, but the weird yet fascinating aliens?! Drop another unsuspecting bunch of space tourists on that planet, and I'd pay to see it.Save your time and money on this Complete Galactic Incompetence, and just watch 'Pitch Black' instead.",Riddick
240,tdunl1,A B+ retake on Pitch Black's original plot,6,6 September 2013,"This movie was okay. A restart for the franchise, brought the story line back to Riddick and away from the necromancer subplot. I Liked that it was low budget like the original, it helps create a more subtle story. However, unlike the first movie which is a sci-fi retelling of Hitchcock's 'Lifeboat' introducing the Riddick character; a convict with a heart. This story focuses on Riddick and moves his life a long, which is good because that's what the whole story is really about. Riddick's redemption and road to finding out who he really is and where he actually belongs. The pace of this movie is slow and drawn out, similar to Pitch Black. We see the monster before it comes down on all the humanity in the movie. The action scenes are still classic. Everyone's on their toes around Riddick.The dialogue isn't as subtle and deep as Pitch Black. There's no question as to what's going to happen. Riddick actually gets his girl this time and says he's going too. Guess he's tired of having them die. Nor is she a protagonist, she's a supporting character. The Male Captain takes on Fry's role which is an irony all for itself that works out very well for Riddick.if you have enjoyed the Riddick series, definitely go watch this. it's better than Chronicles.",Riddick
241,shibbirac,brilliant,10,6 September 2013,"absolutely fantastic to see Mr Riddick back and back to what he does best dealing death and quips in a way only he can. considering the rating it is violent in places and the special effects even on a budget aren't bad at all putting bigger budget films to shame. Also the cast play their parts very well each with their own set of values or lack of values should i say. I also like how they dealt with the necromancer issue in order to go back to its roots. glad they kept the original director as only he could have done this film justice, also glad and liked how he changed the films into three acts each time shifting up the gears. Riddick is like seeing an old friend after such a long time.All I can say is roll on the next instalment.. PS you keep what you kill..",Riddick
242,Magicnet2,What the hell happened?,5,7 October 2013,"Before I start I want to say, I'm very big fan of Pitch Black, although I'm not a big fan of Vin Diesel. When I first seen the trailer for the first movie, I didn't expected much. I loved the movie and watched it several times. I didn't like CoR that much, but it was an interesting twist on the whole Riddick story. When I heard that a third movie was coming out I was more than cautious, because I feared what they'd do to this lovely franchise. And my fears got true. This movie was one of the worst and boring movies I saw.Pitch Black was wonderful for many reasons. Great character development, good acting, generally good script with believable dialogues and plot, plus very good cgi. The new Riddick movie tried to do the same in many ways and failed in every single category. The characters in this movie are very weak, with little to no logic in their behaviour and the dialogues are just stupid. Santana was simply a joke throughout the whole movie. The Luna guy doing nothing apart from spewing his religious nonsense at the weirdest times didn't bring anything to the movie. Dahl was very promising at the beginning and I was hoping for some kind of a stand off / fight with her and Riddick, but unfortunately, she just beat up Santana. The big boss Johns was a complete disappointment too. And Riddick - he said at the beginning he wanted o find the animal side again. Well I didn't see anything like that in him the whole movie. He looked like an empty shell of Riddick - looked like him, sounded like him, maybe even moved like him, but it wasn't Riddick. The rest of the characters, behaved more like robots - no substance, no personality, just came, said/did their thing and went away. They looked exactly like the type of character, that's there just so they can be killed off one by one. Storytelling was terrible as well - they completely destroyed the suspense of the unknown predator monster, when they showed it right at the beginning. There was no surprise left to get, there was nothing left to see. Everything was completely predictable. The story was exactly identical to Pitch Black. Even with details - They come to a planet, start hunting Riddick, instead he hunts them, them the dark comes, then the monsters come, then they run for power cells, and then they leave. Simply said, this movie was a cheaper and a lot worse Pitch Black ripoff. I presume the director wanted to continue like the Alien series. Get back to basics. Alien 3 managed to do it right, Riddick 3 didn't. It just took the first movie and made it worse in every aspect. This was a HUGE disappointment and I seriously hope, that the next one will be done with more care and intelligence behind it's script. My rating - 5 out of 10, just because it's about Riddick, otherwise it would be 4.",Riddick
243,mr_budalah,Great Riddick movie,7,28 December 2013,"I gave it a 7 because it does not even aspire to be a top movie. But if I were to give it a score based on it being a one of kind ""survival/sci-fi/horror/action"" genre type, I would give it a 9! This is a well done Riddick story that carries on the ""Riddick"" brand. I didn't expect anything more than that and had a very good time watching it. I enjoyed every Riddick title up 'till now and hope that the franchise will keep on going. I am thankful for Vin Diesel's praised involvement in the production of this movie - he knows how to keep his fans, and we love him for this. This is the kind of movie that suits him, and I pray he never stops doing it! Thank you producers! Thank you Vin Diesel! Pleeease keep this franchise alive! I would love it if they'd make a a riddick movie every year, as it is an endless and wonderful universe to explore.",Riddick
244,ferricOxide,A Movie That Knows What It IS,8,15 September 2013,"Is this movie a great piece of cinematic art? Hell no. Then again, it's not meant to be. It's meant to be a bit of eye-candy. It's meant to be a couple hours of disengaging your brain and entertaining yourself. Like most of the rest of the franchise, it succeeds at that.The action is solid. The acting is sufficient. The effects are good without being overdone or too-obviously CGI. Yeah, the settings and the monsters were probably a bit of a rehash from Pitch Black, but that's not a bad thing: Pitch Black was another solid, ""knows what it is"" action movie.While not a great piece of cinematic art, I definitely didn't feel like I'd wasted money having seen it at the theatre and in IMAX.",Riddick
245,sworup_shakya,Riddick is awesome but the movie is not,6,21 September 2013,"Ever since Pitch Black came out back in 2000 I've always been a fan of Riddick. I guess the character of a genuine anti-hero makes itself really intriguing. Riddick's moral compass is crooked; it points toward one thing and one thing only, survival. That's in the so presumed nature of a Furyan, to adapt to a harsh environment, to call it home, Riddick has very quick skill for adaptation, which had kept him alive after most of his race was dead and wiped out. Riddick is a mean killing machine; he has no remorse, no regrets and would do anything moral or immoral, good or bad to survive. But this is where the moral compass comes into play. Riddick would not forsake those who show mercy to him. He has the immense need to preserve the good and innocence in people who actually have it. This makes for the times Riddick would tend and take care of women (at least with the ones with fairly good moral standings) and children.The movie Riddick comes after a long hiatus, almost nine years since the second movie The Chronicles of Riddick, and Riddick fans like me have been eagerly waiting for it since its announcement few years ago. When I heard that the charismatic and infamous Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace of Battlestar Galactica, Katee Shackoff, would be playing a bad-ass role in the movie, I was even more excited. There they were two of my favorite action heroes, male and female, and they were in the same movie. I just couldn't wait.The Chronicles of Riddick was an epic adventure type of movie; Pitch Black was a survival horror. I liked the adventure movie too but Riddick really shines when he's cornered and kept in these survival mode situations. Riddick is not really a decorated general, born leader type of soldier that The Chronicles of Riddick leaves him to be, so it is said that he was betrayed, cornered and left for dead. That's cool, because that would turn Riddick to his survival mode; and now he's in a planet that is more hostile then the one in Pitch Black, that is supposed to be more fun. Riddick the movie has a relatively bigger budget, and a slightly more glamorous star-cast then the first movie, but this one lacks where the first movie had most of its charm. The characters, other than Riddick, in this movie, have next to no significance. Even Dhal, the character of a headstrong woman mercenary played by Katee Shackoff, has not much of a character definition, or even a more prominent role. Riddick does everything here, and since he's highly qualified to do them, all the other guys just stand back and admire a legend at work and just step forward when it's their turn to die. It really weakens the movie though, since we don't know much about the characters, we don't really care if they live or die, and their deaths, one by one, just seem like an excuse to stretch the movie. There is no suspense and thrill. Only time we feel some amount of thrill is when Riddick is in danger, and there could only be so many of these scenes. It would have been some fun if Katee Shackoff's character got into some trouble and kicked ass to get out, but oddly enough, despite her great demeanor as a tough girl, she never really steps away from the ship or the base. She has, as far as I remember, not one scene with her and one of the creatures in the same frame. That's not cool. Vin Diesel is awesome as Riddick, he's always had been, and he single handedly with his presence, hold the movie together, but I always found Riddick the sneaky bastard more fun than Riddick the ultimate warrior, and this movie has none in the set of characters for Riddick to play mind games with. Everything happens so fast that they seem to have started without properly knowing each other. Riddick does try to pull a few strings in the heads of the other main characters when the movie starts but one of them an idiot, another one is genuine good guy (which makes playing mind games really hard) and the last one is a girl who seems to have done an advanced degree in putting up a wall in the head. She just could take any amount of verbal abuse and doesn't at all care for mind games. Ofcouse our good Dr. Riddick never really has enough time in this movie to show this side of his talents but then we only see his warrior side in a survival horror.I had waited a long time for this movie, and this is not a bad movie, but it is not enough. It tries to be the same as the first cult classic in the Riddick series but it lacks the psychological profiles and even the character profile of the creatures that made the first movie such dark and grim horror/thriller. The likes of Katee Sackhoff, Bokeem Woodbine and Matt Nable, are almost wasted in the movie for the lack of good character sketches, and these are good actors. I really missed Cole Hauser's bounty hunter character and Radha Mitchell's ship pilot with a guilty conscience. This movie has none of those. It has good action, but in terms of action I think The Chronicles of Riddick was better. This movie, for me, is not up to par for my high expectations; but it's not because of Riddick's character. Vin Diesel still got it and I would still wait impatiently if they'd announce another Riddick movie, but I would have loved the writer to breathe a little more life to the other characters in this one.",Riddick
246,d_gipp,Didn't I watch this 2 movies ago?,6,13 May 2020,"This movie felt more like a remake of Pitch Black then an actual sequel. While it does take place after Chronicles, it just seemed to be the same story. Planet goes dark, aliens come out, group of survivors try to fight it out, the fakeout leave behind.

All well and good, except the movie never establishes why they can't just run around everywhere, a la Pitch Black monsters being burnt by the light. The weird Egyptian looking dog he hangs around with is a lost opportunity to imagine man's best extraterrestrial friend and is, to me, pretty jarring.I would only recommend watching if you REALLY need to know what Vin does after the disaster that was Chronicles.",Riddick
248,martin-pucher,Great movie??? What a joke....,1,21 September 2013,"I don't know where to start. I had no great expectations but even these were smashed to pieces. Vin as Riddick is cool. Point. That was the positive part. The rest of the so called actors are most of the time ridiculous. But maybe it is because of the real flat storyline and the dump dialogs so it is not their fault they could not give more... A furry big eyed cuddly toy? Wtf. What for? My girlfriend? Yes she smiled... me too... but honestly: Is that really suitable for a Riddick film?I thought Disney also grabbed the rights for Riddick now after Star Wars. One of the worst scene is the one the 'dog' dies. The fight prior to it.. so cheap.I don't want to go into details, I just can't believe that some fanboys give it a ten as 'great movie'. Low budget as excuse??? Have a look at 'District 9' or 'Dredd' which had a similar budget and were much better. OK, Vin Diesel was not cheap for sure...Another extreme strange scene: The motorbike ride. 3 of them copied into the landscape that it looked so obvious as I would expect it from 30 year old movies...I could go on and on but enough. I give it 1 out of ten to balance the 10 from obviously paid people...I'm still so full of anger about this poor film and even more about the 'Excellent movie!' people that I even got back here to strengthen my opinion (while watching Pitch Black right now, which was a great movie!).I know, it's a matter of taste, but I still CAN'T BELIEVE the 10 stars ratings! My guess is that 1- They ones got paid for rating it so high OR 2- They want to show that they want to get more Riddick movies.The second one I would understand a bit at least....",Riddick
249,chrisleary186,Great stuff to watch,10,6 September 2013,Riddick is a movie about Riddick and not really much more.This movie explores a deeper side we have not seen but not all is given away.Riddick knows to keep something back and even under duress. I loved the back story and how he ends up where he is and how he uses people and objects to get where he wants to be. The characters in this move are quite wooden with no need for any real acting and who were really only there for body count. Riddick plans his moves carefully like chess and plays people against each other to his advantage. Riddick has a mixture of traits that make him a real action hero and really hope that there is more in future. I would say he is the ultimate action hero and we do need more in future.,Riddick

This should have continued the story where the last movies or games left it. Its simply the worst movie i've seen in 2013, easily. In fact i cant think of a worse movie in the past 3 years! If u want that Riddick universe to stay great and unspoiled in your mind, avoid this.Vin Diesel acts great as usual, but other characters LOL!

251,frostyjack,"Riddick is a visually stunning sci-fi epic, exuding an atypical authenticity from a combination of multi-faceted aspects.",8,3 April 2014,"It seems it was only a matter of time before Vin Diesel donned the iconic contact lenses and goggles to reprise the role of the formidable anti-hero Riddick – the character that had a helping hand in kick-starting his career back in 2000's Pitch Black. In the latest installment of the Riddick saga, Vin and director David Twohy have scaled back on the colossal galactic universe they created in 2004's The Chronicles Of Riddick and aimed for a more sombre, back-to-basics approach that made the first feature a sufficiently competent sci-fi. Working with a quarter of the budget, Twohy and Diesel managed to round up an impressive ensemble cast including Karl Urban (Star Trek, Dredd), Katee Sackhoff (Battlestar Galactica), Jordi Mollà (Columbiana),WWE superstar Dave Bautista (Marvel's upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy) and Bokeem Woodbine (Total Recall).From the outset, the slow paced one-man-journey is a surprisingly nice touch, which allows for some staggering visual backdrops and fiendishly entertaining encounters with some unfriendly inhabitants. It is due to this nicely paced beginning that we are able to see a less demanding side of Riddick, as he builds a strong companionship with a canine-like creature, which makes for some nice comedic elements and empathetic touches.The second act of the film is when the fun really begins, with Riddick becoming what we love; and what essentially defines him: a monster in the darkness, toying and playing with his prey in a daunting game of hide-and-seek.It is during this second act – when Jordi Mollàs and his crew of bounty hunters arrive – that Mollàs'pulls off a memorable performance as the aptly named Santana; playing it slightly over-the-top and juxtaposing an ominously menacing character – ruthless in his agenda of capturing Riddick – with a comedic, fawning and sycophantic twist. The character could have been terribly clichéd, however, Mollàs is having fun with the role, and pulls it off with a generous conviction.The film unfortunately loses its way in the final act, despite FTN favourite Katie Sackhoff showing up as a ruthless mercenary and potential love interest (if a fourth gets the green light). The ending feels rushed and unfulfilling in comparison to the strong first and second acts. Akin to the old adage – when it rains it pours – suggesting that the worst is yet to come; it is a perfect microcosmic analogy that sufficiently nods toward the sudden drop in quality that encroaches way too deeply into Pitch Black's stratospheric sensibilities and thus, losing it's own idiosyncratic identity that was so adeptly and promisingly incrementing in the first two acts.As a result, Riddick's conclusion becomes a standardised rehash failing to carve out its own mesospheric identity with too much acknowledgment focused on the fundamental aspects, which made the first movie a cut above the rest on its original release. However, despite this, Riddick is a film that will satisfy fans and non-fans respectively, and is a welcome return to the role that defined Vin as a bona-fide action star in Hollywood.The Unrated version will no doubt be even more appealing to core fans of the franchise with both an extended intro (with similarities to the Blindsided comic – see below) and an alternate ending that further addresses the Underverse – filling the gaps from Chronicles – and connecting the Necromonger / Furya storyline that runs throughout the second movie. Saying anymore would lead to spoilers, but overall it is a far more satisfying cut for fans of the second installment with a fulfilling ending that comes ambivalently full circle, whilst leaving an opening for the creative team of Twohy and Diesel.Not only does Riddick look visually stunning; but it also exudes an atypical authenticity from a combination of multi-faceted aspects which all point to the ethos of a good director at the helm, implementing a thorough determination and relentless ambition both; to entertain the casual film goer and to please the core fans of the franchise. It also goes to show that creativity is sometimes best produced under constraints due to the fact there is no room left for complacency. Testament to the effort that went into getting this film kick-started and off the ground.",Riddick
252,michela,Best chick flick ever,1,21 January 2014,"You know when you're feeling a little emotional and need some downtime to curl up with your loved one and a good flick? I've got one word for you... Riddick. Warm cuppa. Cuddly slippers. Hot cold beefcake with them dreamy sparkly eyes. From its stylish minimalist no-dialogue prologue this was always going to be about the man and his battling skills (but there is a couple of chicks as well). I missed out on seeing The Chronicles of Riddick so the 2 min flashback was very helpful to get a feel for what the Necromongers were all about. Hot harems! But not too much back story, just enough to whet your appetite for the main event. Riddick has everything going for him. Moves like the wind. Stunning breath control underwater. Awesome backswing with a trusty thigh bone. The fire and discipline to screw loose armour back into his own flesh. He's good with puppies. You could read Riddick as the tragic tale of a man and his (zebra)dog(thingy) - charming, witty and ultimately heart-wrenching. Or not. I'm pretty sure that his dog dies. Either that or it just runs off after it gets shot with a glowing green bullet.This is not just fluff and puppies. It's deeper than that. In a subtle dig at anti-vaxxers everwhere, writer/director Twohy manages to slip in a timely pro-vaccination message - a little poisonous critter goes a long way if you can milk it in advance and inoculate yourself. It's great know-how that you no longer get in Girl Guides and once our favourite rogue has regained his mojo and and cleared level one in record time, you know you're onto a clear winner. That's because once Riddick clears the puddle Boss, makes it up the stairs and out through the archway, the payoff really kicks in for fans of the first film. It's the Pitch Black action and set-up you remember. Except this time it's different. There's rain. Which changes everything.The only quibble I had with this movie was not seeing enough of those cute little aliens with the snappy tails. One more would have topped off the climactic battle nicely. Otherwise plot-wise, pretty perfect. Not only does RBR live to fight another day but he's even starting to convert the lesbian. Battlestar babe Sackoff was smokin', especially on the end of a rope as she winches Riddick to safety. Reeled in nicely bruv!",Riddick
253,roh_dude,Reaquainting with the inner homicidal maniac.,6,12 September 2013,Quite a good action-er but when compared to the first two installments perhaps a little flat. Obviously not the life of the party the necromungers thought he would be Riddick finds himself on a harsh world and decides he is soft. A little delicate soul searching later and he is facing down some delightful hell world denizens. Some nice fauna and mercenary canon fodder make for some OK action scenes. An ancient world of arcane destruction we get a thumb in a certain classic movies direction. An apocalyptic setting with some reminiscence of pitch black were pleasant indeed however I felt the whole affair had an odd vibe that I could not fully get into.,Riddick
254,BudrodaHooligan,Riddick is back to being a bad-ass again... Sort of,9,6 September 2013,"First of all, my native language is not English, so pardon my grammar mistakes. I'll try to show as little spoilers as possible.This movie is all about survival, told in 3 different ways in 3 different acts. We have the first act which is all about Riddick's survival on a desert-like planet against deadly creatures. This act is the best one since he meets an unusual companion. It is also a good study of the Riddick character and how resourceful he is.Act 2 is about survival against bounty hunters who want a piece of him... Literally! This act shows Riddick in shadows so it's more about getting to know the characters. Jordi Molla, I love this guy, is basically the main bad guy in the movie (ofcourse there are others too). He plays again the sleazy foulmouthed a-hole, which he does best.Act 3 is again about survival against deadly creatures, but this time not with the purpose of staying alive ON the planet, but to get the hell off it. This part is a homage (or rehash if some have called it) to Pitch Black... Which is a good thing in my opinion.Visually this movie is great. Only a few scenes make this movie look cheap, but the rest is well done on such a tight budget. Lots of creatures scenes showing 3 types of creatures which look good enough for me. That said I am easily entertained when it comes to creature movies as long as they look believable. Favorite movies of mine are the first four Alien movies, Gwoemul, Outlander, The Relic, Grabbers, Prometheus, Attack the Block, The Hellboy movies, Mimic and even Godzilla. This doesn't say that the movies are good or bad. Speaking of bad, Godzilla might be the worst on that list, but its monster creator, Patrick Tatopoulos, is the same one that created the creatures in Riddick and this guy knows what he's doing. Weird that he isn't listed in the cast and crew list on IMDbStorywise the movie is simple, so I don't expect people saying: ""but why this and but why that"" much. I just wished there were a bit more Necromancer scenes, especially when you know, after seeing the movie, what they did. I can tell for sure there's already a follow up coming if this movie does well enough at the box office.So I gave it a 9/10 because I was entertained a lot and my needs for violence and creatures were fulfilled. It loses one point because of the lack of Necromancers and what Riddick's actions are against them after what happened to Riddick. Maybe in a future sequel...Go see this movie!",Riddick
255,mgdrk3,Good old-type action movie but...,6,22 September 2013,"hello ...I had the chance to be invited for a premiere of this movie to our local theater. Having no initial intentions of paying a ticket for this one, the price of free was far more than decent for a movie I would consider as acceptable but still wouldn't pay for it.I'm not saying that this movie is bad, as anyone would expect this is my opinion based on my feelings. If one wants a 'simili-human- superhero'like movie where the main character is shown as powerful as overconfident, with one liners showing some form of arrogance, well ... enjoy to the max! Yet this is no Clint Eastwood! At any moment did I feel the pain or any satisfaction for Mr. Riddick, having missed The Chronicles for some reasons, was thinking that I didn't have some elements to enjoy this one, while I remember liking Pitch Black, even if I shall not go through it again.This movie can be disappointing if you have great expectations, just take it for what it is, a fantastic action movie on a desert planet with a real macho-type hero that sticks to his promises.Cheers!",Riddick
256,voodoojew,do not watch this,2,1 December 2013,"worst movie since Babylon ad. no real story, 1 dimensional characters that they spend ton of time attempting to develop but just jump around when they run out of ideas and hope you forget what happened so the writer can just start over. no one associated understand what a sequel is why not just make new characters? because no one with any talent is associated with this piece of garbage. . the writers attempt to make this a sequel over and over again but never actually continue any story and also no continuity in the current story can be found.there are some decent special effects Just don't see this please save your self some brain cells and just don't watch",Riddick
257,gallagher1454,Decent but...,6,18 January 2014,"The movie is decent enough, nothing too exciting. The casting is a strong point for me.One thing I will give the Riddick series is the creature creations. Not just the CG rendering of those creatures, but the imagination that goes into creating them. Pitch Black and Riddick both have very good original creatures.My problem with this movie lies in its similarities to Pitch Black. Riddick borrows heavily from the original movie. I had hoped for something with the strength of story and originality of Pitch Black, but not a copycat. While Chronicles is relevant at the beginning and end of Riddick, it is largely ignored.The movie starts pretty slow but once it gets going it moves along at a good pace. A good flick for a couple of hours entertainment.",Riddick
258,aftermik,cheap & worst,2,19 December 2013,"2 for the cgi guys that just did what they were told to do; 0 for the rest.There is no scenario and not one original idea, the characters are totally shallow with ""who care ?"" background stories if any.The bad guy is really bad and stupid, his big friend proves he is even more at the end like he had no time to understand he would not stand a change confronting Riddick. The girl is bad ass and has not much to say or do except maybe showing her big breast, she fall for Riddick although nothing happened in the movie to explain how their relation get built. It just happened.The actors are seen having a hard time hiding how they could not care less about this job. Face expression, speech, all out of tune... Watching this cheaply thought ""thing"" the only idea that came to my mind have been : some extremely lazy (or that have lost any sense of creativity or just untalented) people had to pay their taxes.NB: I enjoyed the first 2 Riddick movies.",Riddick

The story, special effects, action, and actors were all great. You can tell much care went into staying true to the character and Mythos of his universe. This was in all ways a movie for the fans.Bottom line this movie is true to the character and the fans that screamed for a sequel. Vin Diesel came through for us, so let us show our support right back.If you have not bought it yet, buy it now. Show your support if you are a fan, so we can have more Riddick in the future.",Riddick
260,juarezajj,Recap of trilogy ending with mixed feelings,7,26 January 2014,"I was very excited to see this movie. With the success and enjoyment I had for the first two, my expectations were pretty high. After watching it, I'm a little mixed.Just for clarification, I'm going to share a slight recap of the first two movies to help explain my debacle of emotions with the newest installment.The first movie, ""Pitch Black"" was about an escape convict being transported by a mercenary onboard a civilian transport with innocent by-standards onboard. A catastrophe occurs causing the ship to crash land on a backwater planet with vicious nocturnal aliens which picks off the survivors one by one.In short, it's an alien action movie starring Vin Diesal.The second movie, ""Chronicles of Riddick"" is about Riddicks past. It talks about his roots from a planet called Furyia which met a horrible fate at the hands of a religious group called the Necromongers lead by an entity called The Lord Marshall.In short, it's a science fiction action movie with depth.Now, I was excited to see this movie, thinking it was going to progress with even more narration, but instead taking place in the now instead of bringing up Riddick's past. That didn't really happen. They took a step backwards with this movie, going back to an alien action movie.Normally I don't complain about non-sensical science fiction violence in movies (I'm a typical red blooded male after all) but I had higher expectations by wantin a meaningful story. So, this movie was more or less like the first one with a different cast and different planet.It started kinda slow, giving some insight to what happened to Riddick's time as the new ruler as Lord Marshall and how he ended up on the planet he currently resides on. Some people would prolly complain that the first half an hr are really dry and slow (which seem like an eternity in a 2 hr movie) but you do get to see more of Riddick's tendencies and personality through this part of the movie.The rest of the movie was about pure survival and tactics while slowly building to some action, which I did enjoy. Other than the lack of progression of the story, which I can forgive, I think they could have made the conclusion a little bit better. It was a little corny and in a movie that already shook my faith of being as great as I hoped it to be, such a conclusion can KILL a movie. You can have a decent to great movie, but ruin it by having a shitty ending (The Call, staring Halle Berry comes to mind) I'm not trying to spoil anything, I'm just expressing my opinion especially from what I know from the other 2 movies.Final thoughts, if you love seeing Vin Diesal taking on aliens with little story, than this is for you. If you were hoping for progression in what COULD have been a bad ass trilogy, you might have to wait a little longer.",Riddick
261,mr-hasanaoun,Loved it !!,10,5 September 2013,"I really don't get some people. Everyone was saying how Chronicles was so much more different than Pitch Black (which personally I don't find a negative thing)and they should have stuck to something more like Pitch Black. Then Riddick comes out and people are saying its like watching Pitch Black again. Make up your minds people !Second, if you're expecting this movie to win an Oscar, please don't watch it. It's a sci fi movie with action, killing, fighting and blood. If you got any problem with any of those I don't know why you paid for a ticket really.The movie itself was very good. I've been waiting a looong time for this movie to come out. I've watched the other two Riddick movies waaayyyy too many times for me to remember. If you're a Riddick fan or feel like watching a kick-ass movie then I would recommend going to see Riddick. You don't really need to have watched the first two movies, but I would recommend seeing them anyway if you haven't.",Riddick
262,s-mason9,Riddick performs for the fans.,8,12 September 2013,"Some say garbage, some say boring, and some say it doesn't live up to the previous 2 titles. These people could be overly jaded or just extremely hard to impress. 'Riddick', always succeeds in taking you off world but leaving that fact as a background melody. It doesn't try to brag about it's fiction, it just sits you in the front row and begins. Riddick's new found pet is, in my opinion, a very cool mixture of animals that suits the star's character very well. We get a double dose of bounty hunters and some back story influence. This isn't a fancy dance, but it is fluid and every part of the story has meaning for a later event. If you like the character and it's previous incarnations, this movie will not disappoint. There are no pots of gold at the end of this rainbow, only what you expect. This is why I love this movie.",Riddick
263,jokermtb-787-720009,Great Sci-Fi action film,9,9 September 2013,"I've enjoyed the previous Riddick films, and this one is just as entertaining. I like how this movie shows the Riddick character going back to his roots - quite a contrast from what happened in the last movie's story arc. If you think you've seen it all, with these types of movies, you haven't. Riddick brings good storytelling to the table. And, the characters are not 2-dimensional, you'll actually want something bad to happen to a few of them. Tarantino wishes he could do sci-fi like this. Yeah, I said it.Thoroughly enjoyable roller coaster ride! And yes, I liked the space dog - it was a good foil for the Riddick character. The ending was a little abrupt, and if you never saw the first Riddick movie ""Pitch Black"" you won't know what Riddick and Johns are talking about. I'd forgotten about that from Pitch Black, but it didn't detract from the movie one bit. Find out on your own about the backstory.Go see this movie!",Riddick
264,AverageMoviegoer,"A fun, mindless, interesting visual thrill-fest.",9,13 September 2013,"If you enjoyed the first installments of the Riddick franchise (I'll go so far to include the video games, and additional animated film), you'll enjoy this film for exactly what it is: another installment in the ongoing (hopefully) genre of the mass media serial entertainment that is ""Riddick"".I didn't feel that this film was nearly as all encompassing in its depth or scope comparative to either either Pitch Black or The Chronicles of Riddick. If I had seen neither of those I would however still find it a brainless thrill ride throughout. There is something relatable with Riddick's one-liners and the character as a whole who is the ultimate anti-hero in a seriously f---d up universe. Who has had one of those ""legendary bad days"" after all?If you don't like sci fi, can't handle sexist comments in every direction back and forth, and don't mind four letter words coloring every third sentence, this film like the other ""Riddick"" installments is a cheap thrill that forgoes class and cultural norms for gross adventure and pulse racing action.",Riddick
265,maclaw84,Downsizing the potential of Riddick,4,11 September 2013,"I usually do not write reviews, but after watching Riddick something in me snapped and here I am. I've watched both Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick and loved them, so the bar was set pretty high for Riddick. This movie as many other reviewers say is a Pitch Black ripoff. The potential of the ending of Chronicles of Riddick was enormous so it comes as a surprise they decided to downsize the scale of the movie. From survival horror in Pitch Black, and full scale destruction of the planet in Chronicles of Riddick to Bear Grylls on forgotten world in Riddick.The pace of the movie is too slow for an action movie and the dialogs and plot are too weak (or non existent actually) for drama and having guns and all sort of other equipment takes the thrill away so the movie just can't be a horror. I do understand that the creators of this movie wanted to show us the other side of the Riddick, but they could have started by explaining what he did in the first place to have a such a huge bounty on his head. Some action scenes are so unrealistic that it actually hurts to watch and other are just laughable.Where did they made the mistake? To be honest I think that script was just awful, cheap ripoff of other Riddick movies smashed together and re-shot in different environment. They idea that Riddick needed to get in touch with his wild side is good, but they could have made a movie where by his selfindulgance he looses control over necromongers, is ""killed"" or cast away, and returns for revenge and coordinates of furya. To show the downfall and rise of Riddick. Instead we have the movie where everything is just bogus no action no plot. But the hell if producers want to pay for this its theirs choice. God forbid any intelligent plot in an action movie.All in all I gave it 4 which means i did not like it but from my perspective movie was done well. My only regret is going to cinema for this one.",Riddick
266,SciFiBuf,Excellent movie worthy as the third installment in the Riddick trilogy...,9,7 September 2013,"Please be advised that this movie contains some genuine 'R' rated scenes, so you'll definitely want to leave your younger kids at home! That being said, making this installment of Riddick an 'R' rated movie was a very shrewd move on the part of Twohy and his staff. That's the same that they should have done that with the second installment of this series (Chronicles of Riddick).If you liked Pitch Black and/or Chronicles of Riddick, you'll really like this movie. If you don't like Vin Diesel as an actor, David Twohy as director, or any of the three installments in the Riddick series, then don't bother watching it. You'll be better off watching some kiddie stuff like Star Wars or Star Trek.This was a far better follow-up to Pitch Black in concept and content than it was to Chronicles. As far as this movie goes, I absolutely loved it. It gives Richard B. Riddick more depth of character, and shows him as a true anti-hero (either you hate and fear him, or you admire and want to follow him). He does not come across like some serial maniac who likes to gut alien creatures and ghost mercs/bounty hunters alike with gusto and without discrimination. It shows Riddick as an intelligent survivor, and cunning warrior with a mission - staying alive, and out of triple max prisons.The scenes where the movie is set is a little too reminiscent of Pitch Black and so were the creatures. Even if the latter had a little bit more variety, the flocking or swarming behavior of the water scorpions(?) were a little too similar to the eclipse-triggered surge of the winged predatory carnivores of PB. I thought this venue could have been improved by using a swampy or jungle-like environment with a different mix of critters like monkeys with improved intelligence capacity, but that's just a matter of taste. It would have given the backdrop to the movie a little more imagination, than simply re-hashing the venue from PB.The character acting by Katee Sackhoff (Dahl), I thought was absolutely delicious. She didn't leave me wondering if there was any potential in sci-fi soft porn. She convinced me of it. Her lascivious smirks, salacious comments, and her bitch smacking of Jordi Mollà alias Santana, made the movie all the more interesting and appealing. Speaking of which, I thought Jordi Mollà's acting was C+ at best. His best performance was serving as blade stopper for one of Riddick's MMA tricks. Vin Diesel was typically and as usual B+ or A, depending on your dislike or like of the character. Katee Sackhoff definitely gets an A+. No doubt about it. I'll never again look at another episode of 'Battlestar Galactica' with the same sense of dull interest as before.It was good to see a sense of connection with Chronicles of Riddick brought back to the forefront. Karl Urban as 'Vaako' was excellent, albeit too brief, unfortunately. Karl Urban's acting ability was underutilized entirely too much in this film. The scene of the Valkyries(?) or Necromonger groupies(?) was very well done leaving little to the imagination. It was also good to see Riddick developing some weakness for a change thanks to his implied behavior as a decadent Lord Marshall, however brief his tenure was, and his enemies taking advantage of it. It was also refreshing to see a generous amount of blood, snot and gore flying when the Necros take on Riddick on this forsaken PB redo planet. It's also a shame they left out the blood, snot and gore from a similar fight scene in Chronicles.I only wished they would used more of the 'R' content demonstrated in this film in Chronicles instead of trying to water down the latter for the rating committee. If anything ruined Chronicles it was exactly that. Spending over $100 million on CGI etc. and then cutting bits and pieces from the final version. That left the theatrical release audience annoyed, confused, and mortified that more was not left in. The Director's Cut was far superior to the theatrical release version. I honestly believe that, if that version had been used, it would have helped the audience make better sense of the overall movie plot, and would given Chronicles better overall reviews. Chronicles stands out in my mind as vastly underrated for its potential.In closing, this was a good movie, but not a real block buster. To do the series the justice it deserves, I would like nothing better to see a re-release of Chronicles (in 3D) using more of the soft 'R' material that was deleted, as well as some of the other scenes which were gratuitously cut, and a follow up to Chronicles with Riddick 4. I for one, would definitely like to see a resolution to Kyria's untimely death, and her subsequent possible resurrection in the Underverse, with Furyan nation taking on the Necromongers in a furious cosmic bloodbath! If exploited properly, the entire (Riddick) series has some serious legs left in it for future releases. Also, don't forget to leave the kids at home, please.",Riddick
267,gradinko,is this a syfy production!?,4,23 December 2013,"I'm all for outsourcing CGI to developing countries but why did you have to entrust this particular one to Albania? It's painful to watch Riddick's pathetic doge (wow, much 3D, so computer, many generated). Too bad there was no story or idea to distract from the horrendous visuals. Every single story element is so derivative and/or bland that the peak moment for me was when some monster ate its own intestines. If Aliens 3 was your favourite from that series, go see this one two. Otherwise pirate Riddick 2013, like I did, so that you only need to right a spiteful review after watching it and not riot for your money back (just don't pirate the most hi-res version, it's embarrassing to see all the detail of the film's failure).",Riddick
268,brentonscook,Really?,1,15 January 2014,"What a waste of time and money. I'll try to save you both with my review. First half of movie, Riddick forms bond with dog (literally the only positive aspect of the whole movie) and some bounty hunters show up to kill Riddick. Terrible acting ensues, the director uses the Riddick/dog bond to hold the audience in suspense for several different scenes until the dog is killed...cue second half of movie. Second half of movie is Pitch Black. If this sounds fun, then by all means fire this turd up and enjoy. Otherwise, look elsewhere for some entertainment. Bad plot + B movie dialogue + uninteresting characters = 1 star. What a shame. I really enjoyed Pitch Black, and I though CoR was pretty interesting. Riddick was neither enjoyable nor interesting, just disappointing.",Riddick

I don't remember any scene which looked specially awesome in IMAX but sound effects were nice. The story is simple Riddick is stuck on a planet and he plans to get out of it, to get the bounty on his head a group of bounty hunters arrive on the planet only to be killed by Riddick. I didn't watch any of the Riddick movies before so I think I missed the connection to the back story but you can still watch it and enjoy without missing anything major. Nice special effects throughout the movie!! Don't watch it for the story but if you like special effects then you should watch it!My rating 7/10",Riddick
271,bartekb81,I'm really disappointed...,3,8 September 2013,"I love Pitch Black movie. In fact, it is one of my beloved movies and one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever watched. A perfect mix of horror, action movie and a drama, with colorful and interesting characters and same anti-hero. Chronicles wasn't so good but still was entertaining and fun to watch. So I'm even more disappointed now... Riddick was to be expected as returning to the roots; simply being a better Pitch Black, and proud continue of this great franchise. Unfortunately it isn't half as good as Pitch Black is. Moreover, it is really bad, BAD movie, so bad that I can't understand how David Twohy managed to do that. Riddick sucks in almost every way; it is a truly boring experience most of the time. Script is bad, dialogs are weak, like written by 10 years old. Characters are dull and empty - including Riddick character(Sorry, Vin). Only neurotic Santana seems to be at right place and feels somewhat interesting. Besides of Riddick, I'm truly disappointed in Dahl character - thought she would play a greater role than a plaything to our anti-hero. Not to mention Luna guy who brought to the movie simply nothing. Weak, weak, weak. Riddick is still a tough guy like he was expected to be, but this time he is just unconvincing with his cheesy lines and strange behavior. The only good thing is his bond with a dog, and really, NOTHING else. There is no tense, no dynamic in this movie. Riddick was supposed to be a predator so I thought he would be a real bad-ass finishing off his opponents one by one. But no. There's no single action with him worth to mention. And this one with Santana is a 'bit' awkward... I'm heavily disappointed in this film, in David Twohy and Vin Diesel. Sorry guys, but you totally let me down. Not recommending it.",Riddick
272,estevao-rosa,Another Riddick Great,9,21 September 2013,"Another action packed Sci-Fi flick in the intriguing ""Riddick"" universe. As someone who absolutely loves the Riddick character and has been tracking his evolution from ""Pitch Black"" and then through "" The Chronicles of Riddick"", I can comfortably say this is another great installment to the series. I watched this in the local cinema in Brussels, Belgium and it was an amazing experience - people even started clapping *during* the movie. Its popcorn entertainment and a show of sorts. A tale of an exceptionally gifted yet cursed man against difficult odds, his extraordinary will to survive and talent that plays out like a ballet. Skirting the edges of suspension of belief and dosing us with some awesomeness. I give it solid 9 out of 10 on the basis that it fits the genre neatly, entertains and also as a little tip of the hat to David Twohy and Vin Diesel who have fought hard themselves to continue the Riddick series. I noticed that some reviewers have not found it all that great, I'm not sure what were their initial expectations or how much they understand the character and his universe, but I for one give it a double thumbs up.",Riddick
273,LachieD,Nothing short of brilliant,8,7 September 2013,"I was happy to catch a sneak preview of Riddick already on 4th of September, which I went out to see almost on a whim while not being a fan of the series nor space operas in general, and it turned out to be one of my most enjoyable and satisfying cinema experiences ever.To fully express my opinion of this third installment in the series, I feel a need to digress with my opinions on the first two films.I quite enjoyed Pitch Black, but was not thoroughly impressed by it. I think it had a great setup and pace, and the photophobic monsters worked wonderfully to propel the action and create suspense. But despite the R rating, it felt like a terribly conventional piece of mainstream cinema, with its bland look and writers (or maybe studios) need to remove all the ambiguous elements from characters' personalities, by slowly revealing the bounty hunter as a murderous junkie coward and Riddick as a courageous hero, who eventually gambles his own life to save the others. It all diminished the ability of the movie to test and challenge the morals of the audience and not just their expectations, simply ending up with a criminal (which in my book doesn't render someone a bad person) being a positive character and a hero. I felt the movie could have done more in that direction. Nevertheless, it's a solidly interesting and entertaining sci fi monster fare.Now The Chronicles of Riddick, in my opinion, was a huge misstep by Twohy, and quite an embarrassing one. Despite the obvious positive aspects of the movie, mostly in the production value and some parts of art design, the nonsensical hybrid of the setting established by Pitch Black and Dune inspired fantasy plot simply doesn't work. Removing Pitch Black on the side, the setting and the plot Twohy lays out in The Chronicles is simply clumsy, shallow, uninspired and badly executed, for the great part in the acting department. But since the dialogue is so poorly written and characters so one dimensional, the actors could have not done any better beside appearing cheesy and hammy. Twohy's failure to combine the beautiful potential of the Pitch Black world with a bigger budget in order to create something in the line of a futuristic noir setting, featuring humans spread across the galaxy, living in worlds with various climates, cultures and political systems, his inability to connect it with a story of political plots, assassinations, social and moral dilemmas connected with Riddick's dubious past and nature as a protagonist is a mind-boggling omission. I have no idea how he ended up with script featuring Harkonnen like all evil religious cult spreading terror throughout the galaxy and being lead by characters named Vaako and Lord Marshall. What is even more mind-boggling, instead of throwing that script in the bin, he seeks and gets full support from Vin Diesel, now also the producer, to film that nonsense of a story.Riddick (the movie) from the trailer felt like an uncompromising and non-pretentious throwback to Pitch Black, but more visceral and self- conscious. Perhaps that's what attracted me to see it, and it fully delivered on that promise. The marketing did not lie this time. The movie turned out to be surprising in many positive ways, mainly in its structure, making it a quite unconventional beast. With its slow and engrossing survivalist opening act, to beautifully structured cat and mouse game between Riddick and the mercenaries in act 2, featuring a surprising array of memorable faces and characters and the entertaining interplay between them, to the final act so unrelentingly schlocky and comic book like, that to dislike it you truly must be either very cynical or simply misunderstanding the intention of the filmmakers. Riddick the character is much better developed in this installment, more brutish, dark, unpredictable and in the end compelling.Despite the lower budget, I must compliment Twohy and the art designer in creating a gorgeous looking world. I found the grassy savannas especially impressive. The colors, the shapes, the entire scenery, it's all just wonderful to look at.Quite a lot of people complained on the special effects (mostly CGI), and I'm not sure I fully understand. I think today's audience is perhaps too spoiled by mere technical quality, to appreciate more the value of design in special effects. Also, on several places where the special effects do look subpar, to a person with a positive mind and likeness for uncommon looking stuff, these scenes look more appealing and charming than superbly technically executed but passionless CGI.Above all the movie in fun, well written, occasionally smart, enjoyable and highly rewarding to watch. It simply delivers on its promise of entertaining you.Some SPOILERS below.Of the minor flaws I can mention the necessary but clumsy flashback featuring Necromongers, Santana character wanting to kill Riddick while they still didn't know where he hid the power cores, and the conveniently disappearing and appearing venom creatures in the third act, but I understand that without the element of creatures fearing light it was difficult to construct that part of the movie more convincingly and better.I understand that there are many fans of The Chronicles out there, that they enjoyed the references to Necromongers, but I remain convinced that The Chronicles storyline and universe is broken and can't be fixed, despite the passion of Twohy and Diesel for the mythology. I fear of the next Riddick film because of that, but this sentiment still won't stop me in enjoying Riddick 3, and I will continue to recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining and unpretentious movie to see, either in cinema or at home on DVD.

"" quotes.Most setup stories had no real foundation or logical progression, just crap, crap is what I have to say.Most of it seemed to be padding, and some extra nonsensical ""I'm so hard that I'll do this to you"" or ""He is so hard that he'll do that to you"" or Let's show some muscles and boobs for no apparent reason, preferably in the moonlight even though he couldn't walk at all in the previous scene.But oh! See the heartless murderous antihero has a soft spot for animals, and for that reason he must be alright.PS: Vin Diesel is so hard he turns lesbians straight!",Riddick
275,yarmen12,So worth it,10,30 September 2013,"I travelled miles to another city to see this movie and was not disappointed.If you're familiar with Riddick, as I am, this film ticks all boxes and delivers the brutal in-your-face-action, suspense and ironic moral values you would expect from a Riddick film. It's dangerously butch.When compared with the previous two instalments it DOES NOT disappoint in these respects, I believe it exceeds the previous films in these respects.However, it could be said the main purpose of this movie is re-introducing audiences to Riddick. Don't get me wrong, I never noticed this when I saw the film, but you have to remember it's been nine years since the previous movie.This is a good thing because you DON'T need to have seen the previous films to understand Riddick. One criticism that has been pointed at this film is that some audiences may find their attention lagging. To this I say: ""Get your head in gear! This is a suspenseful, deep and edgy thriller, appreciate good cinema when you see it!""",Riddick
276,spaceapex,my brother fell asleep,5,5 September 2013,I loved Pitch Black and have watched it many times. Chronicles was good and could have been great if edited properly. I felt like I was watching a B movie script with big budget special effects.. Well even some scenes were B movie at best. The writing was childish. I am peeved that a franchise that could continue to grow and evolve into something of legend like Star Wars and Aliens (ok maybe not on that level but you get my drift) turns into copying the first movie but using a friggin painting for a backdrop in some scenes. The tech in the movie is a joke considering what we saw in the others. BLAHHHHH. My brother literally fell asleep in the theater. The writing could have been a bit more adult and intelligent to get me up to a 6. Pitch Black 8. Chronicles 7. PEACE,Riddick
277,colitisscope,A waste of time and money,1,23 September 2013,"This film makes 'The Spirit' look good by comparison. The cgi work is bottom of the barrel, about 30 minuets in the script turns into a re-write of pitch black and to make up for the terrible production they toss in over the top nudity and the most divisive sexist nonsense I've yet seen used in cinema. Very tastelessly they point out that Katee Sackhoff's character is a lesbian and then take this grotesque bated sexually driven plot gimmick to another level by having her character submit to an over the top sexist invite by Riddick to have sex.Riddick is written overly omnipotent to the entire story while it is happening while interacting with other characters yet fragile and bumbling at times when acting alone. What was a rather skillfully crafted character in the previous films is now ridiculous and one dimensional. There is absolutely no continuity between the Riddick in the previous films and this character.Truly, who ever wrote this went to the Michael Bay School of scripting. This film was made for people who go to movies and want to be made fun of by the very film they just blew ten dollars to see. Literally, this movie is so obviously loaded and half baked there is no way it can or should be taken seriously by anyone with an IQ above 40.",Riddick
278,storabambis,Riddick the first aid nurse,3,14 December 2013,"I read a rave review of this movie that claims all sorts of things and also, almost 200 people found it helpful. Something is very wrong. They say 'The movie is not sexist'. Well, there is one female character, her name is Dahl (though it sounds like Doll all the time),she's a feisty Dolf Lundgrenette lesbian who beats the ____ out of guys. Wait for it. Aaand now she wants to _____ Riddick. For no apparent reason. Well, apart from him being a nice piece of meat. A role model feminist indeed. They say there is no horrible see-through acting. They may be correct.There is not much acting at all. There is some walking through vast awe inspiring landscapes. Quite a lot of sitting on things. Some fighting with CGI fauna, which looks like it popped out of the minds of the creators of Sharkzilla and Dinocroc. Some reciting of 'insert every possible cliché line that you have heard in every b rated action movie'dialogue. Oh, and they say it is 'one of the best Vin's performances to date'. That actually might be true, but it should not have been too hard to surpass the dramatic brilliance of XXX. They say there are no boring parts throughout the movie. How about manly baldy rising up after having been badly wounded. Almost dead. Aaand he comes back up again. Oops, almost dead again. Some heavy breathing and he's up again. Just sear the fist sized wound with some red hot stone that conveniently fell down from the sky a couple of frames before. Good as new. OK OK, fair enough, maybe I am not supposed to expect for character development and a coherent storyline in a B action movie. But a lesbian getting all wet for the baldy? SERIOUSLY?!",Riddick
279,calebbrinkman,Riddick,9,25 September 2013,"So I saw Riddick which is a 3rd movie in the trilogy taking place after the last movie Vaako turns on Riddick to leave him stranded on a sun scorched planet. Good movie 9 Stars from me. Over 20,000 people on IMDb give it 6.9 Stars it was kind of weird how Riddick positions himself in the movie I don't know if that's something goes back to the original Pitch Black or The Chronicles of Riddick. He gets a pet dingo who manages to break up the tension but this dog is a fighter and helps Riddick a few different times in Riddick's desperation to get off the sun scorched planet he is on Riddick activates a beacon and plans on stealing a ship taking a chance that he will be found by bounty hunters. He is found by bounty hunters and starts to kill them slowly this is where the movie becomes a sci-fi horror film just like Pitch Black in fact as I was leaving the theater one person suggested it was too much like Pitch Black. The movie dose a good job of getting you scared for the bounty hunters in fact there is a big portion of the movie where the focus is on the bounty hunters and Riddick doesn't even speak for around 20 minutes of the film or so it seemed. I don't want to spoil anything else and I hope this last detail doesn't spoil the end may suggest that there will be another Riddick movie. When Riddick says, ""Sooner or later we all must return home."" So at the end Riddick decides to go to Hellion Prime. I believe to settle the score with Vaako.

280,bkresto,Pitch Black 2,6,14 September 2013,"Writing a quick review since it does not seem that any of the other reviews negatively mentions that this movie is practically identical to pitch black.Was really looking forward to this movie since i loved how the last one ended with him taking charge of the necromongers. This movie practically just skips everything that happened in his time with them as being story less and just goes back to him kicking alien ass on a deserted planet and killing some bounty hunters, which isn't bad at all but i don't think it develops the Riddick storyline at all and in the end i got the feeling of 'what was the whole point'.",Riddick
281,wwb12,Strong continuation of a series that lost its way,8,22 December 2013,"I'm a massive Pitch Black/Chronicles fan, but I've often thought that Chronicles was over-indulgent and lacked what made the original movie and the overall story great. Chronicles had the glitzy effects and the huge cast... But I just didn't feel that comfortable with it.Here we are, almost a decade later, with Riddick. I'm going to keep this short and sweet. This film isn't Pitch Black. This film isn't Chronicles. This film is a whole other beast. Imagine 127 Hours merged with Cast Away and Pitch Black. That's really the only way I can describe this film. It has a bit of a wobbly intro, but once it gets going, the first hour is an absolute treat. Then the story shifts to bounty hunters, and the overall plot gets stronger and deeper. Overall, the plot and pacing of the movie is excellent - better than any Riddick film before it.The acting is also great. Vin Diesel does his thing, and we get to see him as Riddick actually looking vulnerable and weak, which really adds to the intensity of the situation. Katee Sackhoff brings her usual hard ass persona to the mix, and the rest of the cast really hold their own (especially the two captains.The only thing that was a bit patchy in places was the effects, but that really can't be helped considering the budget constraints.My final thoughts: -Different, but in my opinion stronger than the previous two movies. -All the actors performed brilliantly, especially Vin and Katee. -Effects were lackluster. -If you're a fan of any of the previous two this is worth watching. -You get to see Katee Sackhoff's boobs - and that is worth buying the movie 10x over if you're a Battlestar fan.Final verdict: 8/10. - a bigger budget and a bit less baron desert would've seen it climb higher, because it really was a fun movie.",Riddick

I meant to say it was good enough to end a series.All in all, what was seen here was another Pitch Black movie, the same base story-line anyway. Riddick ends up stranded on a deserted planet, Riddick kills people, Riddick finds a greater threat, teams up with people he was once killing, someone turns on him, he kills them, rest of team escapes planet.It's easy to see that there was nothing original in this story line when compared to Pitch Black. Unfortunately however, there seemed to be a moment toward the end when hint was made toward a sequel to this movie. IN THE EVENT that a new movie is made, it will have to contain a new story line and be much better than this one if it is expected to bring this saga back from the category of series-ending movies.",Riddick

I was easily able to figure out what was going on after I dozed off. In addition to being bored to tears, I was insulted by the treatment of the lesbian character in the film inappropriately named Dahl, which all the male characters pronounced as Doll.As if the name of the character wasn't demeaning enough, she was subjected to repeated rape threats, and innuendo that she could be easily and ""willingly"" converted by Riddick.The film implied at the end that Dahl did indeed had sex with Riddick, the most boring and unattractive man in the universe. Not even Katee ""Starbuck"" Sackhoff presence could save this film from its misogyny and backwards views on lesbians. If this is Hollywood's way of being ""inclusive"" of gay and lesbian characters I'd rather they keep them in the closet.",Riddick
284,rebel-825-7133,Same old same old,5,6 November 2013,"First of all i love Riddick character and that is not because i am bold headed too. Riddick is a type of 80s hero that is in your face and can not be stopped. That is hard too pull of because mainly heroes of that type create psychological counter-reaction and we end up cheering for the bad guy. Vin Diesel still menages to balance Riddick character and create hero we all can enjoy watching in movie. This is good part of the movie.Now the bad part. Main reason i gave this movie score of 5 is because its the same old same old Pitch Black movie but slightly worse. There is no development in the story franchise, short explanation of how the emperor fell to the desolate planet is more than lacking. Same plot and same twist, desolate outpost, incoming monsters when the dark/rain comes and again desperate run to fuel the ship exactly the same as in Pitch Black.The thing i find odd in the movie is if the Riddick was an emperor of Necromongers and he sends the signal from the outpost to attract the mercenary's how the hell Necromongers did not picked the signal? So long story short, this movie is in best average. It has the same story as Pitch Black wrapped in slightly worse package. They can do much better than this, just look at the game and anime.",Riddick
285,zplazm,highly underrated cult film,10,4 November 2013,"I thought it was better than Prometheus, and the reason why this has a low rating is that people went in expecting it to be a car film set in California. it' s full of mucus drenched monsters, and the lines are cynical, delivered crisper than Clint Eastwood shooting aliens. Totally gripping and delightfully OTT. it has a indie film, personally involved, production and will certainly be a cult, if you like monsters and suspense, grittiness, and live silent landscapes, this is great. this is the good, the bad and the ugly of the extra planetary monster flicks. at some points, the film simply cannot be faulted. there are leaps in time where something was going to happen and then illogically, doesn't, and some slight tackiness, and if you have the ability to shrug off inconsistencies in order to enjoy an exceptional lonestar villain tarzan wildman versus slimy monsters and headhunters film, you will love it.",Riddick

I have to tell you, the alien dog is one of the best CGI creatures I have ever seen.It really shocked me to find out that the budget on this movie was of only $38 million!! How in heavens did they do this amazing looking movie with such a low budget. Well, $38 million is no pocket change but today's blockbusters carry a price tag of at list $120 million.I was really sorry that this movie was not a wild success that it deserved to be. It earned $98,337,295 worldwide.The meager success of the previous ""Chronicles of Riddick"" movie was the reason why it took so long for the sequel to come out.I just hope that Vin Diesel is not discouraged by this anemic box office performance and continues investing on this cool franchise.

This movie was really great, it was entertaining all round the graphics in it were good without being over bearing like many of todays movies seem to be. God forbid a movie gets credit for being well written lets just smash graphics into it and forget the writer. Well not in this case! The story was good, Vin Diesel was good.

288,Uhura88,Extremely UNDER-rated film...a MUST see!!!!,10,1 March 2014,"SETTING : The beginning of the movie sets the tone, with what seems to be a dead hand on the ground, ready to be devoured by an alien bird. The world of Riddick truly comes alive in this film. The creatures are unique, in particular the mud-amphibian. The sky on the un-known planet is simply breath-taking. There seems to be a shattered planet or possibly a satellite that illuminates the skies during the night time scenes. The landscape is filled with exotic plants and large red sedimentary rock pillars that add to the mystery of the planet. ACTORS: They say that actions speak louder than words. Although we do not get more background information or much dialogue from Riddick, this film gives the audience an abundant amount of non-verbal communication through Vin Diesel's behavior. He went from the leader of the necros back to square one; deserted on that forsaken planet. He shows the audience how he was weak, and how he gained his strength back. The other characters in the film added a comical touch that definitely had me laughing periodically. I did not expect for the other characters to have a more developed storyline, like other people who reviewed this film did. Though it would have been interesting it would have been unnecessary, unwarranted and taken time away from the plot. PLOT: With that said the plot in this movie was great! We see that Riddick was blindsided because he grew weak, then we see how he develops into the old strong, level-headed Riddickthroughout the movie. I do not want to say more in fear of spoiling the entire movie. OVERALL: AMAZING film!!!! The scenes were entertaining and kept me interested! Especially when there were a couple of twists throughout.",Riddick

The aliens that go with Riddick try to kill him. Riddick kills some of the aliens and the cliff he is standing on gets blown up. Riddick survives the fall and makes his way to a medical outpost/station. He calls for help and bounty hunters come to get him. Once the bounty hunters get there, Riddick and the bounty hunters fight. Then the situation gets worse when it starts to rain.Long story short, Riddick is like Pitch Black except the main monsters come out during the rain. Pitch black has one bounty hunter while Riddick has multiple bounty hunters. In the extended cut (which I saw) Riddick had more blood and nakedness than Pitch Black.",Riddick

To cut to the chase we both found the film highly entertaining and found it to be one of the better films we've seen this year and is now on or list for must buy blu rays.. hopefully before Christmas.Yeah sure the film does a bit of a rehash of pitch black but who cares its done very well with some great action and for some reason reviewers marked it down for being a rehash, how picky can you get the sheer amount of films out there that have rehashed stories is mind boggling.. die-hard anyone.Anyways all I'm going to say is that if your a Sci Fi fan and you love a good action film then go and see this this film, it deserves to make a profit and I for one would love to see Vin Diesel make another and seriously any score less than 4 you really need to take that review into question.",Riddick

Normally a fool proof tool, I was shocked and annoyed at how poor this film was. Firstly, the plot. The first 30 minutes of this film are painfully slow and completely pointless. It's there just as a preamble to show how Riddick becomes immune to a venomous creature by injecting himself with the venom.which has never been proved to work. What a crock of painful insert. Then we a crew of ""mercs"" coming up because he stood in front of beacon! Random.Next, the script. Don't get me started on the use of the words ambulance when referring to rescue ships. Or ""jailbreaking"" a ship to get it to work. COME ON! Jailbreaking?!?! Really! Slipping in with lines that should be in The Fast and the Furious, ""Drive it like you stole it!"" And from other films, ""shoot him on general principal"" (Pulp Fiction), it was more like a Spoof Sci-fi than an action film.I would have walked out, but I became curious as to how bad it could be.Seriously, if you can avoid this film, I would suggest you do. Shocking.",Riddick
294,der_feriale,Only for comic fans,6,29 October 2013,"The opening scene is really promising (great end-time atmosphere). But then the movie continues like a TV-series: Everything unfolds slowly, stretched by superfluously non-entertaining dialog or monologue from Riddick. Unlike in a good TV-series, there is only simple character-building: the characters are more like comic characters. Riddick is the anti-hero with amazing skills while most of his adversaries are hollow heads. Especially the mercenary that wants to find out his sons fate is a moronic character and doesn't fit to his profession. Can't say that it is boring though. It's just not first or second class entertainment. One could compare it with one of those comic books with lots of volumes. While reading one of those, you realize that it's crap and a waste of time but you keep on reading.",Riddick
295,Graeme_Redmond,Riddickulous...,1,29 August 2013,"After having come back from a preview of Riddick, the sequel to Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick I found myself to be so annoyed at the film. Granted, I wasn't particularly looking forward to it, especially after the not so great Chronicles of Riddick, but that's besides the point.We find Riddick(played by Vin Diesel), stranded on a lone planet, with nothing to help him only his wit's. Left to fend for himself against Vicious dogs and many other mutated creatures, he finally grows a strong enough bond with a puppy he found and fed after it's parent was killed (You'll find the dog to be possibly the most likable character in this film). After a while he finds a mercenary base where he can give himself up, allowing people to come and hunt him down, he fights with them,(kind of...) and has tonnes of gory action involved, including 2 giant bear traps. They then aid Riddick in getting off the planet and after he bribes them. End story...All in all this film fails on so many levels, it lacks in a decent story, and the cgi is some of the worst I have ever seen. There's also some form of sexual joke that Riddick makes towards one of the female characters that is borderline on rape...oh and he also has the power to change her from being a lesbian to straight, what I don't even know...I also found myself nodding off while watching it every now and then, nothing was keeping me entertained or grabbing my attention.There were some moments however, the costume design was decent and some jokes here and there were quite good.However for anyone expecting a lot of Karl Urban, prepare to be sorely disappointed.I give this film 3.5/10 and will most likely never watch it again.This is my first review and I hope I did a good job!",Riddick
296,Claudius101,"The film, the directing the works",7,21 February 2014,"Just finished watching Riddick ( 2013). David Twohy throws another Riddick(sounds like a vegetable) at us with the hope of regaining but actually losing Riddick fans. The creator of the Riddick Chronicles gives us another film mostly filmed on a set with obvious and unfortunately out of today's date effects. Plenty of green screen contains scenes become obvious especially when the Vin Diesel is walking sideways and not straight into the field. For instance when he is on a lookout for predators which are bound to hunt him down. Overall the film is not actually bad. The cast is decent and the actors make brilliant work of the given set, and reduced budget in comparison with other big titles for 2013 and the recent 2014 films. Scenes full of straight humour and a few one liners make the film's digressing de picture and shallow effects easy to swallow. You can relate to the characters and even learn a few lessons about determination. Moreover one of the film's lessons is not to be out of shape treating being normal and sidetrack as a sin. I recommend watching it mostly for the fans of The Riddick stories and of course Vin Diesel who does a tremendous job in terms of acting and using his powerful voice to create some impresser monologues. One that got my attention is his monologue while he is in chains threatening everybody's lives and showing off a cocky attitude whilst 'Not Givin'a'f**k) pardon the use of the words 'whilst'and 'attitude'.

I hadn't seen either before and found the first to be pretty decent and second to be good enough to make me wonder where things we're going to go. There were so many places to take this within the Riddick universe but fifteen minutes in I said to myself ""damn, I hope the whole plot isn't him trying to get off this planet."" Too bad I was right! There was absolutely nothing good about this movie and it did not add to the plot-line in any way. Just a bunch of Riddick drivel......implausible medical procedures, yup, nonsense ecosystems, yup, killer creatures coming out at dark, yup, pending intractable darkness, yup, the token friend of Riddick that originally he didn't want who then dies, yup. It even includes the worn out Riddick line ""it's not me you need to be worried about it's them."" My relative likes just about every movie you put in front of her and even she thought this was dead awful. The fact that this movie has a 7.3 on IMDb makes me seriously concerned there may be review scamming by these big media giants. People can't seriously be this easily sated......

I rushed to the cinema and bought the tickets.Lets begin by saying that after about half an hour i started wondering what does this film reminds me of? Well it's pretty much Pitch Black all over again. Deserted planet, people hunting Riddick, monster, dark falls monsters come out. It is a copy of the script apart from a few minor tweaks. Even the characters were copied, they had a religious guy, a girl (who was kind of boyish), the good cop and etc. I must say it was a great disappointment and I did actually consider leaving the cinema about half way through.

300,scophi,"Should have been title ""Pitch Black 2""",6,9 September 2013,"Although this was a good film on it's own, I am disappointed by the continuity of the story line. Diesel and the cast were great. The action scenes were pretty good. And the special effects were about where you'd want them. There's even a little humor thrown in. But the storyline itself is definitely a step backward in the overall Chronicles arc.Pitch Black was big on action, short on plot. But that was OK. It set up the character of Riddick. It worked as a first installment...a beginning. The Chronicles of Riddick then opened up a whole universe to us with Riddick's back story, the decimation of Furya and his people, the Elementals, the Necromongers, the Underverse, etc. It gave us politics and religion and revenge and a dark story to follow. Riddick, this third film, basically dismisses the last movie and repeats the first movie with a few character changes...almost like a reboot. In my mind, it's Pitch Black 2, not Chronicles 3.Don't get me wrong...it's a good movie in its own right. Twohy does a great job of bringing the audience right back into Riddick's world without missing a step. I was just disappointed that it didn't advance the overall story.

Riddick The Review by LeonidNot seeing last part of story within saga, but rather as a separate movie is useless, so any review that gives critique about what movie is and does not incorporate whole story as basis and than points shortcomings is by my opinion plain ignorant.So I will respect your time and be precise with few words as possible.The movie gives presence of ""or else"" from its 0 moment, interrogating your memory and setting scene for Fury, for it will burst, when it is supposed to, so there you have a timing and ticking voices in hypes, so you can predict danger feel it with Furian senses, eyes ears and vibrating your whole body (in selected theaters only: just kidding)Yes you along get bitten, fall of a cliff, fight incomprehensible dangers, and than they become clear, obvious, breathing, around and planning to simply chop a piece the sooner the better.You fight with Riddick, and along him, he does not give reactions you would, he defies reason in moments, but looks as only logic is his, jumping towards fear emitting surroundings focusing on beast, one after other, bigger, more fearsome and deadly, poison, powerful flesh tearing jaws in front. He tames one, use venom of other, even exploit it, and when ready sinks into bath with mother of monsters itself, proves her wrong.Finally, Furian, inside his natural habitat, desolate world with nothing to survive with, breathing full lungs of danger, calling the scourge of the galaxy to find him... (actually those were danger underachievers).As points of story take place, once again, the ultimate super-silent, fast as blink of jet fins Riddick driven to gain freedom in his own right, puts feet on unknown ground, fearless, again, he asks for fer deal from his executioners to be, which are by than bloated with fear from everything that moves or make sound or ... have or not ... name.YES that is Riddick Movie I want to see. 10 out of 10.",Riddick
303,sofie-kodal,Riddick back in action,7,29 September 2013,"It was a real pleasure to Se Riddick back in action. (Sexy as always) In Denmark it received a lot of criticism that it didn't deserve, witch resulted in me not having any expectations. It has a a really slow start (first 20 min. or so), but makes up for it later. The overall plot works fine, with a bunch of entertaining moments ""Head in a box"" (This was the best laugh ever) :) . I would have preferred it to ""move"" a little faster, but overall i was entertained and if you like the other two Riddick movies i can definitely recommend it. It has a big similarity to the pitch black, which some may find too much, but i don't think its a problem.",Riddick
304,b-wight,A bit boring !,6,15 January 2014,"I was a bit disappointed with instalment of the Riddick saga ! The plot is paper thin,script is poor at best and as for Vin Diesel, Oscar material he's not !! Gave it 6 stars really for the special effects and for me that was the only highlight of the whole thing. Maybe I expected too much,but this toiled to brighten up a dull January evening.I recommend that you wait until it's in the bargain bin of your local HMV before you buy it ! Let's hope they think long and hard before they make another !",Riddick
305,earleshane,Average at best.,4,5 December 2013,"Was very disappointed with this film, the other 2 were great and full of action and all followed a good narrative. However, this film fell short of my expectations. The story line is exceptionally boring, It's almost two hours of just Riddick being stuck on a planet, on his own, fighting the same people... What was most disappointing for me was, in the other films it shows how powerful and awesome Riddick is but there was no display of fighting.However, Vin Diesel is a great actor in it and fills the role of Riddick perfectly, it's a shame that the writers didn't give him a chance to shine. It's worth a watch if you are bored one night, but don't go out of your way to watch it.",Riddick

The Chronicles were alright, but didn't deliver the same edge as Pitch Black. The third part went back to simplicity. But honestly, it is far from being a good movie. The good ratings on IMDb are a complete mystery to me. Special effects were mediocre, acting of some of the mercenaries belonged buried deep underground and the dialogs... saving the best for last... the dialogs were so indescribably bad that I have to assume they were made up on the spot. Seriously, even Vin Diesel's lines, and he really didn't say much, sucked!Don't go to a theater for that. It is a waste of good money.",Riddick
307,dyardich,remake of pitch black.. been there did it done it.,1,18 September 2013,"disappointing. Vin was way to cool, way to bad and a cheesy remake of Riddick 1. we have a bad desert planet everyone will die Riddick kills the monsters and saves the day but doesn't get the girl in the end. been there did it done it. movie could have been reduced to 10 minutes due to no substance. The problem is Riddick 2 set the bar. This movie was boring, my girlfriend and I walked out to get popcorn and wanted to leave =/. If you want a Vin D fix you got it. Furthermore Vin wasn't in 1/4 of the movie. Just lurking in the background watching others spooked out because Riddick is gonna get them gets old. yes folks don't waste your time wait for HBO. I doubt there will be a Riddick 4 and end the misery if this is all you got. Heck I had to pay for gas 15 dollar popcorn and two 5 dollar cokes =(",Riddick
308,quahogman78,They needed to push the release date back for this....why?,4,6 September 2013,"Were they trying to get a box office bump on the heels of F&F6? Certainly the extra time didn't make this movie any better. I loved the first one (Pitch Black) and liked the second one even though the Chronicles of Riddick was panned by some. I found the CoR to have some interesting characters and a novel story line. David Twohy is capable of much better writing, but in this movie ""Riddick"", Twohy just mails it in. I was hoping much of Riddick's back story would be filled in, but very little was added. The dialog was sophomoric and over the top even for an action flick. Even worse, the rest of the characters were shallow and uninteresting. I know this movie was supposed to be made less expensively than most of this genre, but why does the writing have to suck?...and suck badly?In Pitch Black, the appearance of the aliens were not completely revealed until the tension had a chance to build a bit. This made PB more suspenseful. On the other hand in Riddick, the aliens that Riddick and company are to do battle with later are completely revealed at the beginning. This is a mistake in the plot. By the time the aliens start their rampage, I'm not scared at all, (especially since I haven't been made to care about the dull and flat characters).The CGI was OK, visually the movie is decent. Riddick's pet Tasmanian Tiger was sort of a sweet touch. The best thing I can say about Riddick is that it didn't seem that horrible compared to the mindless schlock of other movies in the 17 minutes of previews, that I had to endure before Riddick started. I like Diesel and Sackoff and really wanted to like this movie. After 9 years of waiting this is a big disappointment. This movie probably killed the franchise. If they do manage to do another sequel, Twohy and the other writers need to be fired. The first run of this movie should have been on the Syfy channel. Save your money and wait for it on cable.",Riddick
309,ninjaeatingataco,Riddick Returns to Darkness,9,6 September 2013,"There have only been a few time this year that I have gotten to leave the theater with a giant grin on my face, Riddick was one of those times. I spent a little bit of time reading others reviews before I started typing this up and, I won't lie, they kind of ticked me off. Riddick is a movie that took its 40 Million dollar budget and stretched it to the absolute MAX, I also feel like this is one of Vin's best performances to date. There is no sexism in the film...There is no horrible see through acting...there is no moment during this movie when I was bored...It's a thrill ride. A brief summary Act 1-Riddick is stranded on what might be his home planet and has to re-man up after becoming soft while leading the Necromongers (Riddick being the only person hard enough to ever soften up when taking over a galaxy dominating army) There is a dog in act one but it plays very well into the story and I personally got attached to the pup...think of Will Smith's dog in ""I am Legend"" Act 2-Mercs are brought to the planet and the fun begins...for the next forty five minutes the story is about the Mercs and Riddick becomes what we all love...a monster in the Darkness.Act 3-It starts raining...I'm going to stop there on act three because I want to spoil nothing... The End-Was exactly what I wanted and had me leaving the theater with a giant grin on my face. WARNING: This is not a happy sing along movie with a perfect hero who saves the day in the endthis is also not ""A Piece of Art."" This is Riddick it's Muddy, Bloody, Painful and as always FUN!",Riddick
310,MrFLiLv,Looks like it was made 10 years ago,4,15 September 2013,"Watched this movie yesterday in Imax, and the first thing that appears on screen is that this movie does not represent Imax experience and quality.Looks really bad. Movie effects are awful. Acting was bad. Corny lines and typical old action movie jokes.As for the cast i see Keith Urban is on the front page, and he was in the movie for less then 1 minute.I was disappointed, and really cant say anything good about this movie.Would not recommend it, but if you are a Riddick fan watch it when it gets on DVD, cause there is no point of watching it in cinema.",Riddick
311,mahendranx4,Not even close to what I expected,3,6 September 2013,"The only reason I went to see the film was because it had a 8.0 prerelease rating on IMDb (The first one was really awful). I regret paying a 100rs for such a bad movie.I really do. The only thing good about it was Vin Diesel. The direction was kinda average, But the environment, camera-techniques and the animation really sucked. The story too is below average. The actress looks amazing though, it was another good thing about it.Most parts of the film is kinda boring because, they tried to add a feeling of ""loneliness"" into it... and the drastically failed at it. I am not saying the movie is unbearable, up to a certain extend it is good and all, but it ain't worth a good rating and a good review. The dog featured in the movie was a good idea, it succeeded in helping to depict Riddick as a good guy and that was the only thing ""good"" about Riddick",Riddick
312,jayantakhumballambam,OK that wasn't Badass that was unrealistic.,6,27 December 2013,"Come on man, the movie had everything it takes to be a perfect sci-fi movie, a secluded planet crawling with unknown creatures and stuff. But sadly the director seemed to think somehow that he can make his hero do whatever he fancy. And whats more he wants us to believe in it.The scene where he cut off the head of Santana was not badass that was a turn off. Hollywood really need a touch of reality these days. You cannot still talk badass and do badass when you are in chains ( that too iron chains not some silky loose ones )and surrounded by at least five men with guns in their hands. It just didn't work for me maybe it wold have had I been a seven year old but sadly I know what is possible and whats not. At some point the movie makes me wonder if I am watching a sci-fi movie or a super hero movie. I wonder if Riddick and Superman had a duel, who would have won ?",Riddick
313,auryg-9,Best Riddick film so far,10,2 June 2014,"Excellent film. It sums the best aspects of ""Pitch Black"" and the ""Chronicles of Riddick"". Again we are back to a single planet, but seeing Riddick challenge survival here comprise probably the best part of the film for me.Riddick seems completely at ease and fitting with this lonely but deadly landscape. His words are just like his actions - measured and well-placed. His style shines in this film, way more than in Pitch Black.Sadly, we don't see as much of the Riddick universe as we have seen with Chronicles of Riddick, but it's fine nonetheless as it expands his story (or legend) a bit further.Any excuse to see Diesel performing his stealth-silent-deadly criminal is a good excuse, I say.Here's hoping that Riddick 4 has a greater budget to show once again more of his universe (or the underverse and Kyra).If you liked any of the previous films (or both), this isn't a waste of your time.",Riddick
314,deimosweb,Riddick's Next Chapter,9,8 September 2013,"Riddick's newest chapter definitely fits the dark worlds seen in previous installments. The graphics are spectacular and while the overall story stalls in places (intentional pacing is my guess), the plot and characters are solid. Riddick's gritty and vengeful nature is evident. Some of his capabilities make me wonder if he's more than human at times. He's an antihero that you cheer for. If you're a Riddick fan, this is something you don't want to miss on the big screen. The sound effects and visuals add so much to the dark atmosphere. You want the theater effect. Twohy did a masterful job in creating this strange world and bringing it to life on the screen. Definitely worth watching several times.",Riddick
315,raiden395,A bland march through a sullen rehash,6,7 September 2013,"I saw Pitch Black in 2000, and quite frankly I was amazed. What I found truly significant about that film was the build-up. Pitch Black spent somewhere around an hour in heavy character development before unleashing the monsters. By the time you saw serious action, you already had feelings towards each character, you cared whether they lived or died, you could relate.In sharp juxtaposition, Riddick offers none of that. What makes this contrast so devastatingly drastic is that the stories consistently parallel one another. If we step back and view them side by side, we have the same formula: tremendous hardship occurs, people hunt Riddick/ character development, darkness falls and monsters ensue, run for fuel cells, escape. This formula worked well for Pitch Black for several reasons: the acting was well above average, the characters (and their subsequent actions) were plausible, the CG was pretty state-of-the-art at the time, and the story, although not untold, was given a novel approach. What we're faced with in Riddick is one tired cliché after another. I feel like we spent a large portion of the movie either watching Riddick heal himself, or converse with his dog. As was mentioned in other reviews, the monster was spoiled within the first few minutes of the movie. By the time you get to the characters, you've almost had enough. Once Santana arrives you may think that things will speed/shape up, at least development-wise. Sure he works well as a comic relief, but I'm sorry to say that significant development will not be had. Santana, who is immediately identified as a psychopath, simply continues in that vein, offering no substance to the role other than what is plainly superficial. What's more is that each character follows in much the same way. They come into the scene, state who and what they are, and that is as much character development as you'll get.I'm not sure if I needed to state this explicitly or whether it was implied in my comments on development, but the script was drab and uninteresting. Having characters that were sub-par only made the futility of each uttered word more obvious. You would find a chuckle here and there, but most of the time you'd find yourself thinking ""I've heard that line a dozen times before"", or, as I was, thinking the lines that were about to be said.It's as if, in this movie, the director/writers were intent upon building Riddick's character solely. This put them at a huge disadvantage. Riddick's character alone was never enough to drive a movie, as he's an anti-hero. Take the two proceeding movies: in Pitch Black what was ultimately fascinating was Riddick's interaction between Johns, Fry, and Imam; in CoR, his interaction between Vaako, Toombs, Aerion, and the slew of other characters.The bottom line is that this movie suffers dearly from an unoriginal story, poor character development, deplorable writing, and very little suspense, basically all the things that made the first two, especially Pitch Black, enjoyable. I give it 6 out of 10 because I'm a fan of the series and was happy just to see a progression, even if it wasn't, in my opinion, the best direction. My hopes rest in this series furthering itself beyond this travesty of cinema and the next (movie) being more worthy of its predecessors than this bland rehash.",Riddick
316,danrsteer,7.0 - Really!!!! What film did everyone else watch?,5,18 September 2013,"This film should have been names Pitch Black 2 - as it was more or less a remake of the first film but not quite as good.Pitch Black was a great Sci-Fi fright film that introduced you to a great character - Riddick, with the fun of aliens jumping out at you from the dark and an awesome crash scene at the beginning - one of my favorite films.Chronicles dived deeper into that character and opened up a whole universe to you and much deeper story line, with great atmospheric surrounding.Riddick - back to a barren planet, more aliens but not nearly as ""jump out at you"", no furthering of the character... first film in a long time I've left feeling disappointed.I give it an average 5 - as I would watch it rented on Blu-ray but sooner not have bothered with the cinema, was fun.",Riddick
317,tobacbas,Riddick Quick Review,10,4 September 2013,"The dynamic between riddick and the dog creature which i assume is cross between a great Dane and a dingo is amazing. Nice to see the softer side of riddick which kind of reminded me of the end of pitch black when he let go of Carolyn and this time he takes in the puppy which is a really nice contrast to letting her go and taking something new in.The sequence of him injecting himself with the venom as well as the dog is genius which i take it was a few months on that desolate world and then when he finally gets through sets us up for the call to get some mercs on the scene knowing full well 2 ships will arrive. The choice of characters for the mercs was spot on especially Katee sackhoff as dahl (god i love her so much) such a talent. But for me jordi molla was a great choice as Santana.Im going to skip on a bit here to 2 scenes which got me thinking. There is one scene at the start of the movie where we see mountains with odd shaped rocks and then again later on in the movie. I am convinced they were shaped purposely in that way to resemble the creatures from pitch black in particular their bones or blind spot bones ;) If so this was a genius addition to the movie and i even asked my mate who was with me and he agreed it had to be there on purpose.Rolling on into the action sequences towards the end they were fast paced and hard as nails especially when riddick was climbing up the mountain and the creatures were following him, like that scene is alien vs predator when the predators were kicking the aliens off the mountain (really great scene though and very well done) Over all the ending was immaculate just like pitch blacks ending and hopefully leaves it open for another part in the future. As a long time fan of pitch black and Vin diesel this movie was worth every penny and the fact he risked his house on this movie was a great move as it was worth the risk.Well done Vin another job well done and thank you so much for bringing me back 13 years into my past to relive another pitch black adventure.",Riddick
318,afiefikhwan,Not interesting !!,4,5 September 2013,"I wouldn't recommend all of you to watch this movie. This movie is just focusing too much about Riddick and the movie seems like lack of character.The storyline is too slow, and makes me really bored. The beginning of the movie already make me bored. And after reading back the synopsis of this movie, it says Sci-Fi Film. Oh crap, Sci-Fi Film not an interesting movie to watch.But the good thing of this movie, I like the Graphics of this movie, the sound clarity of this movie. Last but not least, don't waste your money for this movie. Just go watch another movie.",Riddick
319,cjtcook,More Conan than Conan,9,9 September 2013,"Cut out the spaceships, laser guns, and the other trappings of any space opera and you will have the nuts and bolts of a great Conan story surpassing any true Conan film to date. The first half of the movie focuses on Riddick's softness of being too civilized by ascending to the throne of the Necromongers. This led to their ultimate betrayal leaving him near death and marooned on a savage planet. The later half of the film focuses on Riddick coming back to his noble savage ways and once again becoming the ultimate predator while being hunted by opposing groups of mercenaries. Vin Diesel's performance is strong throughout the film, and it showed that even after all these years, he could slip back into the dark, menacing yet charismatic Riddick persona with ease. Katee Sackhoff, Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica, provided a powerful female rival as the mercenary Dahl, who was a great homage to another classic Conan character, Red Sonya. The special effects of this movie were pretty standard with Vin Diesel interacting with plenty of CGI creatures, but the fighting choreography was top notch, reflecting plenty nods to Frank Frazetta's cover work for Conan. On the other hand, the musical score jarred against the flow of the movie with its slow, almost oppressively heavy metal beats.Like any Conan tale, this story begins by Riddick losing both the girl and his horse, and by the end of it was able to win a new horse and the heart of a new woman, as they rode off together into the sunset.",Riddick
320,rehtaehsedai,Disappointing,3,15 September 2013,"Racial stereotyping, lack of a cohesive plot and poor scriptwriting make for a terrible mix. Even with Vin Diesel as Riddick, there is no escaping this trifecta prescription for failure.As a Riddick (and Vin Diesel) fan, I saw this in IMAX, so I was ready for a great ride. However, partway through, with a lack of tension, lack of empathy for the characters, including Riddick, and a lack of clever dialogue, I found myself looking at my watch and envying the audience members who had already counted their losses and left before the climactic storm even came.The movie started off well enough. Riddick is inexplicably stranded on hostile planet, with a multitude of scary CGI creatures for him to render into submission, or die trying. How did he end up here? Where is he going? Will he survive? There is mystery and there is tension. What happened to the Necromongers? Will they return before Underverse Come? Strangely, Karl Urban is top-billed but only has a disappointing 2-minute cameo.A storm is coming on the planet, and clearly Riddick must leave. Why? What is in the storm? He finds a merc post and scans himself in for pick-up. Clearly, however, he is conflicted about outright stealing a merc ship, killing them off one by one, and helping them escape the upcoming storm. Once the other humans arrive, the movie declines quickly.There are Latino and African American characters who are, yes, you guessed it, stupid, character stereotyped, and who will die. I was disappointed in Vin Diesel, who is bi-racial himself, for allowing this blatant stereotyping in his film. The lone, surviving strong female is rich on the ""F-word"" and blatantly declares, ""I don't F*** guys"". Additionally, there is a none too subtle declaration that the main Latino character plans to rape her. In the middle of the mission, she inexplicably begins a spit bath at the sink. The audience gets a gratuitous boob shot. Why on earth would a soldier, merc or otherwise, bathe in the middle of a mission? Especially when surrounded by self-proclaimed rapists and the cleverest, scariest bounty in the Universe? By the time the storm comes, although you know there will be creatures, you really don't care what happens to the characters, not even Riddick. I think that's why several audience members had left by this point. I didn't get to ask them. Not surprisingly, something, something, something happens with the creatures and then a group of white people escape the planet, including a young, superfluous Christian boy. Oh wait, Vin Diesel is bi-racial, so I guess he is the lone ethnic survivor. But you already knew Riddick would escape, didn't you?Save yourself the money and wait for the next film. Hopefully Vin Diesel will find his way back to clever dialogue and an interesting plot.",Riddick
321,yoda3657,Hope your not afraid of the dark,8,4 October 2013,I really enjoyed this movie as it went back to the original Riddick origins. Riddick is as always alone with the odds against him. Obviously there are some unbelievable moments but that what makes this film more fun. I am also happy that they tied in a nice transition from the second movie (Chronicles of Riddick) to help the viewer understand the progression and the reasoning why they are on this planet and the end goal.I think they could have done more and let the viewers realize that there was more hope but overall i would say this was a enjoyable film non-the-less.,Riddick
322,LumpysFriend,More than a fun sci-fi flick,8,4 September 2013,"I wasn't expecting much. When I heard of the sequel I assumed it'd be a bigger and ""better"" chapter in the Richard D. Riddick series. Then I saw the trailer and thought that going back to the basics of Pitch Black felt like Twohy didn't know how to go bigger and was reverting into his safe bubble. I was wrong. This is by far Twohy's strongest script with a surprising range of fleshed-out characters. The first ten minutes of the movie has no dialogue and right from the get-go I was pleasantly surprised. It begins to feel like an appropriate direction to take the character. There are jokes that don't work but most do. While Riddick's monologue is a little... quaint (and a cgi dog companion that feels a tad out of place; but i get why it's there) i really think it's important that 'Riddick' is a success at the box office -- to help open the way for genuinely fun, inventive sci-fi narratives with a budget.",Riddick

But eventually catches pace as the bounty hunters land on the planet. The dull daylight look do disturb, but then comes the night, what exactly we are waiting for after Pitch Black.Ending was a little unexpected and not Pitch Black like, should have left with a feeling of Riddick being a selfish self-centered character. But by the time it ends, a Vin and Riddick franchise fan would be totally satisfied with all that has happened. Overall a must watch treat for Vin fans.",Riddick

I wouldn't say I was dragged along to the latest installment of gravel voiced bulk of confusion - Vin Desel's Riddick (Cert 15), but I wasn't really looking forward to it either, especially after the previous 'Pitch Black and Chronicles drivel...Our hero wakes up on a barren planet after being left for dead and then spends the rest of the movie trying to get off the planet whilst all the time behaving like a human being!!, (he cries, he's in pain, he cares,and oh and boy did he get old and chunky), I thought the planet a rather nice place actually, especially as i didn't see any cinemas with posters of upcoming Vin Desel movies..the whole thing chugged along without much rhyme or reason and I kept imagining that a 15 years old boy had written the script and was shouting from behind the camera ""more tits, more tits"" and trying to get as much (bad) CGI in as he could, the dialogue was actually more painful than the fight scenes ""he tried to ghost me"" growls some muscle head to another muscle head, I'm fairly sure that all with all the testosterone there was little space for important words.. Well then, now for the good points: it finished, um... err...the guns were nice...um...ahem.. I'm sure that if you're reading this then you're thinking of seeing it you will queue up, pay your money and, no doubt, enjoy it but it just seems like they needn't have bothered.At best a diversion, at worst a ridiculous piece of cod aliens/ predator that just continues to annoy...",Riddick

I was wrong, congratulations Vin, you pulled it off. The whole first 1/3 of this movie was a complete waste of time. Space dogs, really? Then the mercenaries say, while standing on a foreign planet, when contemplating calling for additional help is like, ""an ambulance calling for an ambulance"". So people from other planets, far in the future have ambulances? Even worse is a crime that Diesel himself commits, he being a Furion, from the planet Furya apparently calls people a ""Jamoke"". Do me a favor Vin, if you want another sequel, drop me an email, I can whip up something better for what will be, I'm sure far less than what you paid for this abomination.

326,james_stopford,Great Summer Movie (spoilers),8,5 September 2013,"The negative reviews for this film are clearly people who go to the cinema looking for pieces of art etc. Me personally, I love a good old summer blockbuster and this certainly fits the bill. The first 40 minutes of Riddick exploring and adapting to the new wasteland he has been abandoned on are visually amazing, a long way from the small budget Pitch Black had to work on. I was a bit concerned when Riddick started training a puppy devil dog but this actually allowed for some interesting scenes. Then the 2 merc teams land and the film really kicks into gear with Riddick outplanning and outsmarting his foes, picking them off one by one without them even knowing he was close. Low and behold, a deal between the mercs and Riddick takes a sour note and Riddick is captured just as a storm which unleashes the mud monsters hits. This last 20 minutes of the film is a nod to Pitch Black and is still done very well. The cast all play their roles very well, with the occasional wooden acting. I have read in a review on a professional website that Katee Sackhoff's character is portrayed in a sexist manner and is just there for eye candy but I personally have no idea what film this reviewer was watching. Throughout the film she is more intelligent than her male counterparts and regularly kicks the behind of a fellow merc. The only criticism is a fairly important character in the film is directly linked to a character from Pitch Black but with no reminder me and my friends struggled to remember who they were. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie but I went in knowing what to expect. If you're expecting a drama filled piece of art you may be better off going to see Rush. If you want an all out popcorn action film, definitely go and see this. One last question I'll leave everyone with to answer after you've seen the film, who was the bad guy?",Riddick

Richard B Riddick is up to his old tricks again, and if you're a fan, you won't be disappointed, definitely a must see.Vin Diesel is great as always, playing a character that never ceases to enthral me, and the rest of the cast is great too.You know a movie is good when it makes you watch the previous movies when you get home from seeing it. The music is also exceptional I found too, fitting in very well with the action scenes.I've always found Riddick to be a movie that is very rich in its universe, it pulls you in without really telling you much, and this movie does exactly the same, worth a watch even if you're not a fan.",Riddick
328,email-784-270407,Late summer fun,9,6 September 2013,"Being a confirmed Riddick fan I found myself in a nearly deserted West End cinema last night, just 2 days after UK theatrical release. But who cares? Great sound, comfyish seat, big screen and old shiny-eyes up to his usual ripped tricks. Lagoons of blood, relentless demonic monsters, gallons of goriness, umpteen Mercs and loads of That Music. Just the ticket.I too would have liked a more involved segue from Chronicles though suspect we'll see more of Vakko and gang before long.Good atmospheric build-up and enjoyed the spectre of Riddick owning a puppy (of sorts). Splendid special effects throughout and suspect I'll watch this again when it comes out on DVD. All in all a noisy and fun 1hr 50 mins. Bring it on!",Riddick
329,suzzie526,You have already seen this movie,3,6 September 2013,"If this weren't another Riddick movie, I would have walked out.If you're a huge Riddick fan, and you've already seen Pitch Black, then you've essentially already seen this movie. Except ""Stay In the Light"" and ""Stay Out of the Light"" are now ""Stay Out of the Wet."" There's a lot of recycled content in this movie, from the concept to the music and even some of the alien monster noises. The monsters themselves even resemble those found in Pitch Black, though without the awesomely gnarly protruding eyes.But now Riddick has a dog. And suddenly he's concerned about right and wrong instead of being the classic anti-hero from all previous movies. Nothing is solved. Like Pitch Black, the entire movie is about him getting off a planet infested with alien monsters bent on eating him. The huge mass of predatory aliens only come out into the world when it rains, which apparently, judging from the desert-like conditions is extremely rare. Sort of like another certain planet, also desert-like, whose creatures only venture out when it's completely dark, another uncommon event.I was surprised that Karl Urban got such high billing considering he's on the screen for about two minutes. If you were seeking resolution concerning Furya and the necromongers, forget it. Instead, you'll get Vin Diesel and his CGI canine. He almost manages to eek out a tear when it inevitably dies. A softer, kinder Riddick.Save your $10 and just wait for the video if you HAVE to see it. But this movie was such an obvious ploy for money without regard to the Riddick series that I'm going to black it out of my memory and pretend it doesn't exist.",Riddick
330,Indeepsurf,Heck ya! How long have we been waiting.,9,6 September 2013,"Another great Riddick flick. I am glad Vin did what he said he would a few years ago about what he'd do if he could not get cash to make it.I give it a 9 only for two reasons.1. No Toombs... Even a cameo would have been cool. 2. See #1.If you are looking for badassery and classic Riddick lines lines like ""You came light. A four man crew crew for me."" it will not let you down. The CGI is not at The Avatar level, but not much is. Darkness hides a lot. Sackoff is good in her niche role. It was a good casting choice. As others have me mentioned it is a combination of the two previous movies which is fine by me. If it ain't broke etc. Enjoy!",Riddick
331,prasanna11-784-19849,Typical Riddick Movie Series,8,6 September 2013,"The movie is good one for Riddick fans. however, I liked Chronicle of Riddick and Pitch black better than this one. My only guess why they made this movie low budget is because of loss of Chronicle of Riddick in box office. They want to make significant profit in this movie to take next one. Thats the only reason i can think of.Overall, the movie is typical Riddick Movie where Riddick is tough man who survives even worst adverse situation where a normal human being cannot survive. I liked the 1st half better than the second half.New Planets, New Creatures and New Fight sequence all add spice to the movie but its no way close to PITCH BLACK which to me is ultimate. They need to come up with new storyline that should involve combination of Alien Creatures and Different planets. for example, Chronicle of riddick came up with different planets which was exciting and thrilling. This is the only movie series where different planets are seen. Thats why I like this movie very much.anyway, this movie may just make good money because of brand name 'Vin Diesel and Riddick character. They should probably use the success of this movie to come up with better ideas and new storyline that is more exciting and thrilling.if they keep repeating the same thing, people will ultimately get bored.My overall take on the Movie is OK to watch once. They definitely must improve if they want to take riddick series further. my guess is Fans may get little disappointed on the movie. we normally give 1 chance to make it better but there is no second chance. so better next riddick movie is good.",Riddick
332,random_darkangel,Excellent Movie,10,6 September 2013,"A Spoiler free Opinion!This movie brought everything to the screen I expected of it and then some. A few critics have bashed it for shorting the character 'Riddick' (Vin Diesel) of emotional outlets but I think these people are over thinking one aspect of the character and missing out on everything that has gone before and is happening in this point of the story. This movie does have similarities to the original Pitch Black but I don't look at it as a fault, the differences help show the growth of the character and how events have changed and shaped things up to the present, while the similarities to the past really bring about a intense kind of reflection on the characters involved. The set up for another movie is a grade A stage waiting to erupt with purpose and passion! My only reserved complaint is that I hope we don't have to wait another 9 yrs to see the next installment of this series.",Riddick
333,nkbarretto,Expected it to be better :(,5,7 September 2013,"Saw Riddick last night and I was hoping it was a little better than it was. It was a little dragged out. Seeing that it was always on one planet, one little station made it bland. It would have been nice to see more hand-to-hand combat as we did in Chronicles of Riddick and Pitch Black. The ending left me with a smirk on my face. Riddick being SAVED? Not what I was expecting, the bad ass hero outlaw should never be saved. I do believe Riddick fell short on this film. Motor cycle jet packed bikes were cool but too fabricated to the point where it was noticeably digitalized. The alien-like creatures made me feel like I was watching a replay of Sigourney Weaver's 1979 Alien movie. I was often left clueless about this characters son ""Johns"". I could not remember who they were referring to from the Chronicles of Riddick. Too much talking, not enough ass kicking. Full frontal nudity came to me as a shocker and I would love to b-slap the parents who brought their 6,7,and 8 year olds to see the movie (yes, there were many in the theater). You all should know better, it's rated R.Overall, I recommend seeing Riddick if you are a big Vin Deisel fan but do not expect to leave the theater saying, ""That movie was awesome!!!"" because you won't. The theater was actually very quiet when the credits came on...We want more Riddick, but with a NEW STORY!",Riddick
334,caleyshoemaker,Disappointing end to a hopeful franchise,4,7 September 2013,"It is unfortunate that the producers of this film were willing to fund a whole new story- that was basically the same story as Pitch Black. Pitch Black was a great film, with dusty, underground sci-fi appeal that was completed with the matured, complex sequel Chronicles of Riddick. Riddick basically glazed over the complex, political upheaval of the ""necromancers"" during Riddick's reign to focus on his training of a dog, and then the fighting of monsters that came out during the rain/dark. This movie was a re-hash full of sexual innuendos and testosterone fueled jokes, that, while funny, ruined what could have been a great end to what could have been one of the great sci-fi trilogies. It was fun to watch, once- but will ruin the Riddick franchises's hopes of making it into the history books as a true classic. I wish I hadn't watched it and that they had left me with Chronicles of Riddick - and hopes of a better ending.",Riddick

Ridiculous dialogue along with sub par acting made the audience laugh at what were supposed to be serious scenes.The start of the movie was really good and looked as if we were in for an epic sci fi adventure. That quickly went away and the film went downhill from there.Riddick states that he was returning to his old bad ass ways, then adopts a dog. Cheesy and very disappointing. I thought it was disgraceful that they added Karl Urban's name to the credits. He is in the film for maybe ten seconds.",Riddick
336,projectslimeball,Teenage Fanboy community highly active on IMDb. Don't believe overly positive reviews.,3,9 September 2013,"No one should be giving this a rating above 4 stars. If people keep giving a high rating to this movie, then the producers will keep making this substandard tripe and we won't get another good movie out of this franchise.I love you Vin, but this movie was just POOR. I know you and David are buddies, but please think of having someone else write the script for Riddick 4, that is if there is one. After 3 movies featuring a desert planet setting, the whole Tatooine thing is now officially played out. Try a dark temperate rain forest for the next sequel, OK.The first 2 movies correctly went for a dramatic start that grabbed the audience early. The beginning of Riddick3 was slow and drawn out. Also I didn't need to see the scorpion-like creatures with an endo-skeleton until later in movie. However, once you all start fighting them, everything was over too quickly. That was the portion of the movie needs to be drawn out more.The movie starts with 11 mercs, one is a woman and then there's the more genteel bible boy. The other 9 of them are pretty hard-boiled. Some are more fearful of their impending doom, but essentially there's not enough nuanced differences between the roles to give the cast texture. There's not enough depth within each personality or among the types of personalities. Certainly, not enough to hold the interest of most audiences.I went to see this movie in the afternoon with about 15-20 people in the theater. At the end, the disappointment was palpable as the audience quickly and quietly left the theater. My only hope is that since this movie was made on the cheap it will do just well enough for a sequel. Then we can get a chance of a better movie, that's more worthy of the franchise.",Riddick
337,amanter167,I am available to write a plot,2,9 September 2013,Okay so lets start with a plot. The movie does not have one. The opening could have been shorter. Was the planet ever inhabited? What was with the golf ball? I think they could have watch cast away to get some ideas. Now lets talk science fiction. A shack on a useless planet has a interstellar phone that only dials mercenaries? Really? Okay so explain how people have speed of light travel with cryo-sleep and they still use conventional weapons? They can't lock the spaceship? What is with the one bullet at a time sniper rifle? Just plain stupid. Now lets talk about characters. Is there any way possible to come up with something other than a band of morons who act tough? How about an all female amazon race? Vin Diesel is not that tall so it would be easy. How about a technically advanced race that cannot adapt to a primitive world? This was a bad remake of pitch black. Pathetic from start to finish.

It explores his capabilities, strengths, weaknesses, and the ever present underestimating his enemies perform.As far as the critiques that this is a Pitch Black rehash, I see it more as these are the worlds in which Riddick lives, so there should be parallels.The visual effects were very well done. The planet environment looked very interesting, offering a wide landscape variety.I recommend this movie to all Sci-Fi fans.",Riddick

Or even play old Riddick, that can be interesting.I want to be able to escape into your acting and the Riddick universe for the rest of my life. Push for more R rated movies.You don't need great supporting actors to make a great Riddick movie. But Katie S was fantastic, and extremely sexy. The largest caveat in the movie was the pep talk line at the end of the movie, supposedly said to ***** but really targeted at the audience; cut that sh@t out.

341,dhimmel73,A Riddick fan let down,5,16 September 2013,"I loved Pitch Black, I watched it before I knew anything about it and it was great, and then came Chronicles and I actually like that better than the first movie (even though it was supposedly critically shunned). The third movie installment left me a bit underwhelmed. The CGI especially of the creatures and his pet were not that well done and did not look life like to me, and the ending is awful. There are parts in the movie that are good, and what you expect from a Riddick movie (ie Riddick's on liners and his ability to get out of situations and always be one step ahead) and the guy who plays John's in the movie is good as well, but the storyline in bland and when you think it is building up to something, it seems to let you down each time. And again I am going to mention the ending, it is nothing short of terrible. Near the end, when they are heading off on the hover bike things to go find something Riddick has hidden, it seems to take a while to get to the location, then when they need to get back on foot, it seems to take only a few minutes. I know it not meant to be science fiction, but there needs to be some semblance of truth in the story.",Riddick
342,vincemus,Disappointed,5,18 September 2013,"I expected much much more from this sequel to Chronicles, and am sorely disappointed.The plot is pathetic, and so the rest of the movie (action, visuals, acting) dies as a result.If I were a newbie to Riddick and watched this movie first then I might find it an OK movie, but with no real hunger for more Riddick. I had that hunger after seeing Pitch Black, and then after the fantastic Chronicles movie I was absolutely ravenous for more.I have waited so long for this movie and have been sorely disappointed.If you are a Riddick fan then watch it, yes, at least to get your Riddick fix, but don't expect much.",Riddick

I would never watch this again, are you serious? we have to watch him bond with a dog for 30 minutes? get out of here. This franchise is officially dead. And don't get me wrong, I love vin Diesel , and i love the other riddick movies, this is not a riddick movie. It has no other actors of not besides Deisel, and don't try yo tell me starbuck is an actress. shes don this and bsg. come on.

The Story Is A Good Lead Up To A Continuation For More films. Now That Vin Owns The Rights To This Series It Is Really Possible That The Story Could Become Something Better Than We Thought Possible. It Is My Hope This Will Be Well Liked By Others. And Cannot Wait For This Story To Continue. The Story Started After The Last Movie . There Is Plenty Of Speed Action And A Actual Story To This movie. There Are Plenty Of Action Movies Out But Not Many Give A Real Story Line That Is Pleasing To See. There Is Some Nudy In A Few Small Parts But Is Limited. Some Bloody Gore But Not Much.

I liked it.. However, I felt the first half hour could have been trimmed by 15 min and over all some parts of movie could have been trimmed to make it more watch-able.. Vin diesel is good as ever.. In fact he's growing as an actor from movie to movie.. still within his comfort of being the macho-super man kinda persona.. but hey, that's his strength and he does a good job of it.. Overall once watchable.. I might give it 6.5 but since there's no 6.5.. I'm giving it a 7..",Riddick
347,sapphireblu76,Disappointed,6,24 September 2013,"I have waited soooo long to see this movie! I love Vin Diesel in everything, but I was honestly and sadly disappointed with this movie. The acting was great, as usual, but they should've called it Pitch Black II or Pitch Black Reloaded. It was just too much of the same thing. If I had never seen Pitch Black, I would've liked this one a lot better. Still enjoyed parts of the film, but left the theater feeling I should've just waited for it to go on DVD. It wasn't worth the cost to see it in the theater. Sorry, Vin. Sorry, David. Maybe when the next installment comes out, you will impress us more. We love Riddick, please don't ruin him.",Riddick

The crown jewel of it all the end (almost) scene, I will not ruin it for you, but you will know it when you see it... The most surprising thing of all is that CGI - one aspect that you would expect to be good in a modern SCI-FI was on par with stuff they were making back in the days of Terminator 1.

349,juancamceballos,Stays close to the original and keeps you entertained.,9,5 January 2014,"The movie wasn't a disappointment and was very similar to the original. There was a continuation of the previous film's plot line, which wasn't the best of the films. For the budget the movie was made on the special effects were absolutely great, however they were ""just enough"" and didn't have a ""wow"" factor. Vin Diesel continues to play an intriguing, lovable character and the story is left with an opening for another. The story line doesn't evolve very much during the film, with the most important information being recaptured during the beginning, and the most important story line information being revealed in the beginning also. The rest of the movie is just pure ""Pitch Black"" action. The film however doesn't leave you over the top excited, it leaves you satisfied or relieved that the franchise wasn't ruined like many others usually are.",Riddick

Characters get 7 out of 10 though and some good lines for amusement. Good music to go with the action scenes. I don't think this a spoiler, not telling circumstances for Riddick's situation, but basically, bad guys want Riddick, they decide they need his help when nasty indigenous creatures come out in the dark when it rains, only way to escape is to recover fuel for the ships which means battling a lot of nasty's. They do it of course then fly off into the sunset. See why I said bad carbon copy?

But I think people are just too serious at times, yes there are a couple cheesy parts but for the most part it is just an entertaining and fun movie.There is action, there is darkness, there is a tie in to the overall story (Furya), there is Katee Sackhoff, and there are some creative action/kill scenes. Not sure what more you can ask for. And I wasn't expecting a lot, I just wanted a decent show and this more than delivers. If you enjoyed the first two as much as I did, then there is no reason why you won't enjoy this one. Just don't be overly critical and have some fun and enjoy it.If you remember why you are watching this in the first place (the character Riddick) then you should be happy with what you get. As fans, we need to support the effort if we hope to see more from this franchise.

When the film started i said OK Riddick find a way to leave and go to your planet or take back our throne but as you may guess something like this never happened, the whole movie takes place in the same planet with evil monsters.As for Vin Diessel he is great like he always is, good performance from all the actors and nice effects.All in all its worthy to see but you may end up expecting something better",Riddick
353,deric-venra-xbox,Another Pitch Black with Higher Budget,4,3 January 2014,"I have to first start off with saying that I loved the 3 movies(dark fury as well) but I felt Riddick has fallen short.I will agree that the actions scenes are cool and if your into your action movies then definitely go see this. If your more interested in the dark-hero Riddick, don't watch it, or lower your expectations to pure fighting as the story is weak and re-hashed. I doubt anyone can deny it, if you look closely enough to both Pitch Black and Riddick alone.I read some of the other reviews where some people claim they did well due to a modest budget but if we compare to Pitch Black which had less of a budget what kept us gripted was the story, the characters as well as the action. This to me felt like the story was made up from Pitch Black and Chronicles. As most other have stated, he ends up on a planet, deserted for some reason apart from the local animal life(like Pitch Black), but he befriends a Dingo like pup(sounds like chronicles with the leopard like prison creatures) which near the end dies trying to save him. He finds an abandoned structure which seems to have survived the rainy season, when all the crazy aliens rise from the ground, sound familiar.Riddick is even seen in one scene in chains banging the struts he is chained to as the aliens start to take over.The last thing I have to say comes from the storyline, if all the bounty hunters from all over the galaxy fit into 2 ships then Riddick's got it easy, especially when at the end they admire him, the lead bounty hunter wanting to only know what happened to his son, Johns from Pitch Black.If your into action and love the Riddick movies then I really do suggest to go watch it for the pure Riddick/Action entertainment. It was really good, if your like me and want more from a movie, apart from having the relationship to his pup which brought a lump to my throat, then you'll be slightly disappointed.",Riddick
354,loki1147,Back to basics,9,4 January 2014,"The original movie where we meet Riddick was one of awe, a truly back to basic Horror/Action Title that brought an edge back into movies at the time.The Second chapter in this Saga challenged a great many fans of the first to take a strong look at where that Character came from, and what the future had in store for him.This movie takes both aspects of what we have seen of Riddick and brings them together while still striving to stay true to that first film, and that is why I gave it a nine.To be able to bridge both worlds, both idea's, while carving a path of death and destruction we haven't seen since that first Riddick film. I applaud the work that went into doing this, the ""spine"" it took to back this idea and bring it into creation.This is what we saw in Pitch Black, this is what we wanted in the second film, this is what made the original the film we all loved.",Riddick
355,garyrmccray,"Almost straight redo of first Riddick with new monsters, sadly.",3,15 January 2014,"I really liked the first Riddick and loved the video games and even the second Movie was pretty good.The problem with this one is two fold.It really is just a slightly modified redo of the original movie even though it is set after previous events:Riddick alone on hostile planet with Bounty Hunters after him.The effects, monsters and dingo dog things are cool and one of the best parts is the Pup he raises and befriends.But a storm makes it obvious that conditions are about to go seriously south so he summons the bounty hunters who of course are no match for Riddick.OK so no surprise there, but Vin as Riddick actually seems to be just kind of following through the role as he remembered it from before and there really isn't anything new or interesting happening.I won't spoil the ending, but if you saw the first movie it would be hard to avoid.Worse is after the second movie, the much hyped Riddick was in a position of power to potentially rebuild the decadent people and government of the place that had spent so much effort trying to destroy him.But at the start of this movie, it is apparent that is a potential he has completely failed to live up to and now he is as much a part of the problem as the rest of them.Seems to be more about Vin Diesel in this sense than it was about the heroic Riddick character himself.If it was really Riddick he would have gotten it straightened out, but since it is actually Vin Diesel pretending to be Riddick, no such luck.In the end he's right back where he started, all the corrupt people betraying him and sticking a bounty back on his head - 3 steps forward and 4 steps back.The movie on its own I'd have given 5 or 6 stars too in spite of Vin's slightly lackluster performance.But what I can't forgive is the incredibly disappointing back story that resulted in the premise for this movie.",Riddick
356,jmichels86,Consider Watching If Braindead,1,30 January 2014,"This movie was, by far, one of the worst I've ever seen. Not this year, not in the past decade, but ever in my life. The weird, out of place one-liners, the lack of any semblance of logical plot development, and the general stupidity of the movie was staggering. ""Okay, lets kill him now....oh wait, now that he kicked a machete through someone's neck, I remembered that we need him to get off the planet"". Don't even get me started on Dahl's character...I literally cringed for Katie Sackoff out of embarrassment every time she said something stupid (which was most of her scripted lines). Oh, and let's not forget the locker situation. The logic of that whole thing seems to be as follows: 1. lock up a part of each ship that is needed for takeoff to prevent Riddick from hijacking a ship. 2. Identify that Riddick has been inside the compound and has written something on the outside of the locker. 3. Open the locker to make sure the ship pieces haven't been stolen. 4. Leave container unlocked and unguarded while discussing plans, and then act surprised with the pieces get stolen. I mean, seriously, have American audiences slipped so far that they can't see how poorly this movie was done? Do people just sit back and chug their 64oz coke and drool on themselves while watching this and then leave satisfied? Ugh.",Riddick
357,chris-jamieson,Essentially an inferior remake of Pitch Black,5,1 March 2014,"It's a shame this series never quite seems to get the script and direction it deserves. Riddick is a great character and Diesel is made for the role. The first third of the film which focuses on Riddick and his survival amongst a the nasty native fauna is the strongest. There's some good action sequences and the effects are a cut above. However, as soon as the other human characters come on the scene its all down hill. The plot, character development and pacing are all lacking. The last half hour of is so similar to Pitch Black I had the feeling I was simply re-watching the original.

Stranded on a planet, figuring things out, discovering that bad things happen when the weather changes, and then dealing with those bad things and getting scooped off the planet at the last minute with monsters chomping at the feet, but only after having been stabbed through a major part of the body by a monster's stabby piece. It was a huge disappointment. I was expecting the next ""chronicle"" of how he dealt with becoming Lord Marshal of the necromongers, and how he dealt with his internal and external emotional struggles, or at least something meaningful like that. Instead we get 2 minutes of explanation of what transpired with his time as Lord Marshal, and then rewind to the start of Pitch Black.Ugh...",Riddick
359,jeabsanchez,Riddick,8,30 August 2014,"Riddick I have always been a big fan of the Riddick character and also Vin Diesel. One of the things I love and hate about the character Riddick is his eyes as I presume that many people wish they had these eyes. But, there is only one problem they are no good on the day only at night. I mean sure he can see in the night and this is an advantage for the most part but what about the day? I really liked the movie it had great characters a lot of funny comments. They really made Riddick back to look like a regular being for a while because he even makes the puppy his best friend and loyal companion. They make Riddick believe he is now an animal again but it makes him feel more at home or more peaceful. All that comes to an end by the mercenaries who kill his new companion. This is a big mistake for Riddick has no mercy upon them and will get his revenge. I prefer them to keep making Riddick a little softer like more on the nice side but still be the evil good guy. this makes people more drawn to it than a heartless killer who just survives.",Riddick
360,bsmith840,How many film sequels have actually been better than the previous?,10,10 September 2014,"Taking into consideration that pitch black was excellent on a shoe string budget. Then wonderfully continued with a new take in the chronicles of riddick. I thought it would be a hard act to follow or even continue but somehow just as riddick says the clock is zero and we are back to pitch black but so much better.So 3 movies each better than before. Now you can be picky and fussy about the quality of the CGI and some of the script but did the movie keep you at the edge of excitement?For me, it definitely did. Now hats off to Vin for sticking to this character. He's a great person overall for being brave in moving forward on this story. He's definitely shown himself through the character and that's what makes it stand out. Vin is no riddick but the human side of riddick is definitely Vin. It's an action movie with story and excitement. I've not come across any 3 movies in succession that have equalled this, except for maybe Star War 4-6.Vin, well done, keep up the great work and keep this character going for as long as it has a story to tell. Riddick needs to get home but let's make it exciting up to the last second of the next series of movies to follow on. Plus, thanks for funding part of the movie to finish it off. You've made many people happy.",Riddick
361,shellmaan,Survival and action-packed sci-fi about a bad-ass guy called Riddick,8,8 December 2013,"Some people criticize this movie saying that its too similar to Pitch Black. But i say that it doesn't really matter. Riddick-movies to me is all about this bad-ass guy showing his awesome survival-skills against all odds, and that is what you get from this movie.Do not expect a follow-up or something similar to the Chronicles. In this movie you see Riddick returning to his lonesome and hard life where he is always hunted but ends up being the hunter. Riddick is an interesting character and Vin Diesel portrays him well. This is sort of a well made B-movie containing cool action-packed sequences performed by a unique and awesome highly skilled predator. But in the end you get the feeling that there should be more, this adventure is a bit too short and i would really love to see Riddick facing more then the same old mercenaries and monsters.",Riddick
362,joebarrett-79644,"Exactly as expected, good",7,1 June 2016,"Vin Diesel stars in this action-packed thriller as his typical jacked bad-ass protagonist who keeps his speaking to a minimal and still needs to work on his conflict resolution. The film also includes Batista, which was neat and I was glad to also see Katee Sackhoff who is basically playing the same role she plays on Longemire but that's due to the fact she is pretty good at it so far.Overall, good movie but only thing holding it back from a higher rating is the ""impossible"" moves Riddick performs and his ability to continuously make it out alive even though the odds are severely against him.",Riddick
363,maijalempiainen-24218,"One scene's worth of plot, movie's worth of action",5,6 October 2016,"Being a fan of this movie series, I had high hopes for this film. In the end they didn't quite crash and burn but... they didn't soar either.Technically, it was a decent film for this genre. The CGI was noticeable, but not really in-your-face, and there was the neat sequence at the beginning where there was hardly any spoken dialogue, as Riddick was at the time alone and just trying to survive in his new environment. Some gimmicks in the plot even caught me by surprise, like the final when the two way battle between Riddick and the mercenaries became a free for all as they all found themselves trying to survive the swarming local critters.In the end this movie suffers from nothing so much as the fact that it is pointless. Because what does it contribute to the ongoing plot of the series? That Riddick is no longer in control of the Necromongers, as he was in the end of the last film.Really, that's it.You could summarize it as: Necromongers betray Riddick and dump him on some hostile planet - Riddick fights some mercs - Riddick steals the merc ship and escapes.Really, you could have covered all that in a one-minute flashback scene. There was some attempt to tie the movie with the previous films by having one of the passing side characters question Riddick about the fate of another character that died way back in Pitch Black, but even that leads to nowhere, as in the end they amicably part ways, presumably to never meet again.So thanks for the action flick, but you didn't answer any of the questions you left open in the previous part. Hopefully someone decides to add a proper closure to the series before Vin Diesel is too old to pull off the role.",Riddick
364,piracy-63270,1 Tab + This Movie = A new view on life,10,24 August 2018,"Riddick is Rididculous.I took 1 tab and watched this and it literally changed my life.Rididick is like the first nations and the french guy is the first one to show up then the American guy trys to mess it all up. But Ridick stay strong!Also did you know that vin diesels name sounds very similar to vince vaughns when your on acid hence the ""Vince Vaughn Block Chain Theory""IF vince vaughn was in this movie it would have been much worse but funnier not that its not funny already but its better with vince dieselGoodbye I love you all except the amish cause they cant read",Riddick
365,antalias,If you love Riddick you got to see this movie,10,7 September 2013,"Riddick 2013 feels like ""Pitch Black"" with the rough environment, killer animals, and wanting to get off world. I can't say specifically what I loved about this movie because I'd be writing ""spoilers"".If you love Riddick you must see this movie. There is action against man and beast. Katee Sackhoff (aka the new Starbucks of BSG) is very butch and I love her too much. We got a hostile environment, big futuristic guns, jet powered motor cycles w/o wheels, (totally cool), killer creepy creatures, sarcasm, and harsh language. Everything you'd want in a Riddick movie. Plus we got Vin Diesel doing Riddick, showing a tender side that is surprising, and a opening for a sequel. What more do you want?This is not for kids, ergo the R rating.",Riddick
366,celiacampbell,Love this series and the main MAN!!,10,28 June 2018,"I am not a real critic but I am a huge fan of Vin Diesel and this series! If you are a fan then you will like it or love it. For me, it gives you a new insight into the first movie, Pitch Black. The movie also brings everything full circle. I highly recommend it! One of my favorites in the series!",Riddick
