0,TheLittleSongbird,A once classic film series hits rock-bottom,3,18 September 2015,"The first two Terminator films are among the best of their genre and are brilliant films also in their own right. Rise of the Machines started the series' decline and had its faults but also had some good things that made it better than its reputation, while Terminator Salvation although with its moments was even more disappointing. While not a complete disaster, the latest in the Terminator franchise is the worst yet and sees a once classic series at rock bottom.Are there any good points? Not many, but yes there are. The best thing about Terminator Genisys is Arnold Schwarzenegger, while more subdued than he can be he is rock-solid and has the most intensity and charisma of the entire cast. Despite not having a lot of screen time and being mute, Byung-hun Lee is nonetheless credible as T-1000. Some of the scenery is quite atmospheric and striking.Everything else was severely wanting. The rest of the cast are not good at all, with Jai Courtney being by far the worst actor for Kyle Reese of the series in a performance that is both insipid and annoying (which didn't entirely surprise me seeing as out of the little I've seen of him he's always struck me as a lazy actor with an arrogant ego). Just as much as the anaemic Emilia Clarke faring the worst of all the actresses playing Sarah Connor, who behaves in a way that you'd expect a stereotypical bratty and vapid high school teenager to act but not Sarah Connor. Jason Clarke is not quite as stiff as Christian Bale was in Terminator Salvation, but it is still a shock to see the role of John Connor being performed and written so blandly. The chemistry between them is also barely there, most of the time it's even non-existent. JK Simmons is basically wasted, and his dialogue and character are forced and out of place.The characters are like personality-less ciphers, with none of what made them so memorable before as characters and no convincing conflict, in a film that definitely could have benefited from less characters and more development (which is non-existent) . The script is overstuffed and confused, as well as tonally unbalanced with overly-complex scientific jargon, cheesy one-liners (even Schwarzenegger's don't work particularly well this time), misplaced comedy (that's even more distracting than in Rise of the Machines and used with even less subtlety) and too many ideas barely explored. The story, as well as having a stitched-together episodic feel, is at best a head-scratcher, with it being confused to being at times incoherent as a result of doing too little with too much. It's also very dull, not just because of the leaden pacing but because there is not much new and little interesting is done with the ideas presented in the film and it completely lacks atmosphere, thrills, mystery or suspense, and any drama is both heavy handed and lacking in heart.Direction from Alan Taylor is lazy, favouring spectacle over depth and story and character development. And unfortunately the spectacle is not that good. The special effects are not terrible, but they at best never rise above just-passable (the worst of the series in this regard, they are quite poor actually in the beginning section and fake-looking too in other parts), are used with little to no imagination, and there is too many of them (sometimes in places where they were not even needed). The action sequences are equally painfully unimaginative, are sloppily edited, are leadenly and predictability choreographed and contain no tension or thrills whatsoever, let alone any fun. It's very erratically shot and scored with a mix of overbearing bombast and dirge-like drone. The ending also felt incredibly forced and tacked on.Overall, Terminator Genisys was a pretty poor and disappointing film, and is by far the worst of the Terminator franchise. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Terminator Genisys
1,Leofwine_draca,Surprisingly watchable despite all the problems,4,25 November 2015,"I admit to being a massive TERMINATOR fan so I had high hopes for this film, until all of the negative reviews came out. I even love TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, so I expected I'd probably like this, and I did - at least, to a degree. That TERMINATOR GENISYS remains oddly enjoyable in the face of so many varied problems is a real surprise.First off, I enjoyed the somewhat convoluted storyline of this film, particularly the early scenes which go in and rejig key moments from THE TERMINATOR. They're imaginative, well staged, and fun. Secondly, I loved seeing Arnie back in his most famous role. They don't give him many good lines here, but despite this he still looks the part although he's less imposing than ever.Now for the bad stuff: the script is poor and the characters are one-dimensional throughout. A lot of criticism has been levelled at Jai Courtney, who was excellent on TV in SPARTACUS, but I think he's been the victim of poor character writing in this and A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD. The bad acting comes from Emilia Clarke, way out of her comfort zone away from GAME OF THRONES, and saddled with an annoying character who is in no way, shape or form, Sarah Connor. Bring back Linda Hamilton! The PG-13 rating hurts this film a lot, as does the incessant CGI action. I thought Alan Taylor would do a better job having come off the back of GAME OF THRONES, but instead he crafts a film which goes for massive, over the top, unrealistic action throughout. The likes of THE RAID 2 should really be teaching the guys in Hollywood that smaller scale but expertly crafted and INTENSE action is what makes an action film these days, not bigger and bigger scale action augmented by endless CGI. Even so, the villains of the film are fine (and it's fun to see Lee Byung-hun in a Hollywood film again) and the special effects aren't as bad as you saw in the trailer. TERMINATOR GENISYS is a deeply flawed film and not one I'd be interested in seeing again in the future, but I'm still glad I saw it the once.",Terminator Genisys
2,SnoopyStyle,time-traveling mess,5,5 April 2016,"The movie starts with Judgement Day 1997. John Connor (Jason Clarke) would lead the human rebellion against Skynet finally defeating it in 2029. John sends Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to 1984 to save Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke). As he is transported, he sees John being attacked. Kyle finds that the past has already been changed. Sarah is a gun-totting hero guarded by a T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who saved her when she was 9.This sequel takes all the Terminator bits and put them in a blender. I would like to enjoy the story but it's too convoluted and doesn't pass any simple logic test. The great thing about the original is that it satisfies its own time-traveling movie logic. There are simple basic questions that can't be answered.Everything else is pretty good. I like Emilia Clarke and I have no problem with Jason Clarke as a performer. Jai Courtney is a bit of a meathead which Michael Biehn was never one. Schwarzenegger's return is a real gem. The two Arnolds fighting is great. The CGI looks good. The action stunts are fun. Plenty of stuff blows up great. This would be a great action film if the story isn't such a time-looping mess.",Terminator Genisys
3,Prismark10,Reheated Terminators,5,13 August 2015,"The US box office of the fifth Terminator sequel has been underwhelming. Whereas T2 was regarded as a zenith of sci-fi action/adventure movies which subsequent films have struggled to match. Terminator Salvation was a good attempt to do something different with the franchise but hampered by Christian Bale playing John Connor by doing a Clint Eastwood impersonation and Arnie then the Governator only turned up for a few seconds as his face was CGIed into another bodybuilder's body.Here Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is sent by John Connor (Jason Clarke) back in time to save Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke.) The first segment of the film is a mash up of Terminator 1 & 2.Just before Kyle was sent back he saw John Connor been attacked by ex-Doctor Who (Matt Smith who plays an advanced Terminator/Skynet) and then we find out things really have got timey-wimey.In this timeline Sarah Connor rescues Kyle and is protected by an older terminator who she calls 'pops' and has been with her since he saved her as a child.Kyle, Sarah and Pops plot to prevent Judgement Day from happening which has now gone to another point in the future from 1997 to 2017.In 2017 there is an integrated operating system on your phone, computer, home entertainment devices (hold on, more plot points from Doctor Who!) called 'Genisys' which is in fact Skynet and its planning to have a big launch which will be new Judgement Day.One thing we never saw in this version of 1984 is Kyle having sex with Sarah. Maybe the other Kyle (Michael Biehn) was still running around with the other Sarah as in this 2017 John Connor their son turns up. However which side is this John on and why does he have facial scarring when there has been no war with Skynet?Its not a bad action film, its just that you notice a steep drop in quality from even the third and fourth sequels which was at least trying to do justice to James Cameron's vision of the franchise.The story is uninvolving and illogical. You even guess that by the end there will be some scenes of the lonely road at night being travelled with a voice-over saying that the future had changed for the better but hold on this is the first part of a planned new trilogy.Jai Courtney and Jason Clarke both seemed miscast in their roles not helped that they might the fourth or fifth actors playing these roles. Arnold Schwarzenegger has one again shown that his A list days were over a decade ago, he barely is a robot here with all the smug one liners. JK Simmons is here to provide comic support.The whole film is lazy and underwhelming when once upon a time its second instalment was ground breaking. Lets face facts in a world of franchise reboots this is a cynical attempt at a money grab rather than any attempt at creativity.",Terminator Genisys
4,claudio_carvalho,How to Destroy the Past with the Mediocrity of the Present,4,3 October 2015,"In 1984, fans of sci-fi with action were surprised by ""Terminator"", one of the best films of this genre in the cinema industry. Followed by the excellent sequel ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991), the franchise apparently ended in 2003 with ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"". However, in 2008, it was released the series ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" that also worked well showing how Sarah and John Connor survived along the years. In 2009, the exhausted franchise was revived by Hollywood with ""Terminator Salvation"". Unfortunately ""Terminator Genisys"" is a typical example of the present days of Hollywood that insists in destroying great films from the past with the mediocrity of the present writers. This time, the studio does not only destroy the franchise but also the character John Connor and the initial vulnerability of Sarah Connor. The number of inconsistencies and paradoxes in the ""butterfly effect"" of the story is amazing. The best part of this movie is the smile of Pops. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""O Exterminador do Futuro: Gênesis"" (""The Terminator from the Future: Genisys"")",Terminator Genisys
5,nogodnomasters,OLD. NOT OBSOLETE,8,25 October 2018,"This is a prequel/sequel both and Arnold explains it using the words ""nexus"" and ""quantum"" so that makes it okay. The antics in the first four or so films has created an alternate past. Fans of the new ""Star Trek"" can understand this, as I scratch my head. It seems a bunch of Terminator geeks got together and asked a bunch of questions...""well if they could do this, why didn't they do that?"" This film attempts to answer them all, except why Hitler wasn't killed as a child.The basic plot is that the humans attempt to keep ""Judgement Day"" from happening (answers one of those questions) which now happens in 2017 with the alternate past/future nexus quantum thing. The same type of graphics was used as in previous films, as it appears we are peaking in CG capability. The aged Arnold is explained that the outer skin still ages. However it didn't explain Emilia Clarke. Hasta la vista, baby Linda Hamilton. Genisys is the new operating system as opposed to ""genesis"" apparently wanting to prevent a lawsuit from the game maker or Jehovah.There were a few good scenes. I liked the addition of J.K. Simmons. Overall this was a mediocre script designed to make a fast buck off fan loyalty. Looks good on the screen.Guide: F-bomb in beginning. Butt nudity.",Terminator Genisys
6,kosmasp,Terminator reborn again ... and again,7,4 October 2015,"The time travel thing is complicated. So is some of the plot of the movie. On the other hand, if you're aware of the history so far (Terminator history that is), than you will see quite a few things that this is giving a nod at. You could say it's paying respect to things that happened in the past (or future to be correct). Arnold is in it again (the CG version of him or his face) is pretty good (worked better than other face CG I've seen recently, even if still not perfect).Sometimes the jokes feel a bit broken or stuck. But if you oversee those flaws and if you haven't seen the trailer, there might be a surprise or two along the way. One of the biggest twists probably can be seen a mile ahead though. Still the action is more than decent enough, the one-liners work (mostly) and it's a nice action movie (even without logic). Try to enjoy it for what it is, instead of comparing it to the previous installments (especially the first two) - even if that is difficult to do - with all the nods and so on",Terminator Genisys
7,Sleepin_Dragon,Much better than I expected.,7,3 September 2020,"I was told multiple times that it was awful, boring, unwatchable, so foolishly I didn't.However, I thought I'd give it a try, and I really liked it. Of course it's flawed, of course it's outrageous and over the top, but the good heavily outweighs the bad, it made me feel incredibly nostalgic, plenty of references and heads up to the first two films.It was a huge gamble to bring Arnie back, I think he's brilliant here, I've never been a huge lover of him as an actor, but in this role he is iconic. He's great. Great to see Matt Smith.Massive special effects, it's all guns blazing. It is perhaps a little too long.Totally enjoyed it, 7/10.",Terminator Genisys
8,classicsoncall,"""On this night we take back our world"".",6,1 February 2016,"If there's one thing I learned watching ""Terminator Genisys"" it's that remembering two time lines is possible if one is exposed to a nexus point in the time flow while in a quantum field. Seems simple, doesn't it? I was prepared ahead of time to disregard the time travel stuff here because let's face it, the idea gets mangled in execution more often than one can keep track of. But this picture is a doozy. Throw in how Skynet infected human subjects with machine-phase matter while restructuring and rebuilding human tissue on a cellular level, well, how can anyone argue they weren't some serious badass dudes.If anything, it seems like this picture negated most of what went before, particularly as presented in the first two Terminator films. You can only tamper with original concepts so much before they get diluted down to incoherence. Arnie deserved better than to be reduced to 'Pops'.",Terminator Genisys
9,jboothmillard,Terminator Genisys,4,9 July 2015,"The Terminator series has had an up and down history, the first two films are outstanding, the third film was okay, the fourth was terrible, and there was a short lived TV series about Sarah Connor, this fifth film was created in the hope of rebooting the series, directed by Alan Taylor (Thor: The Dark World). Basically in the 2029, John Connor (The Great Gatsby's Jason Clarke) has lead the Human Resistance to victory against the machines led by Skynet, but what they had not counted on was Skynet's counter attack, activating a time machine and sending a T-800 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back to the year 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke), John's mother. John's right-hand man Kyle Reese (A Good Day to Die Hard's Jai Courtney) volunteers to travel back in time to protect Sarah, as he floats in the machine's magnetic field, he witnesses John being attacked, and receives new memories from his childhood about events in 2017. Upon its arrival, the T-800 Terminator is disabled by Sarah and a reprogrammed T-800 called the Guardian (also Schwarzenegger), she calls him ""Pops"", he was sent to protect her when she was nine years old, meaning that the original past where Sarah was vulnerable in 1984 was changed. Kyle arrives a short time later, and is immediately attacked by a liquid metal T-1000 Terminator (Lee Byung-hun), he eventually joins Sarah and the Guardian, they destroy the T-1000 using acid to melt it, Kyle is confused by the change of Sarah, until she explains the past. It is revealed that Sarah and the Guardian have constructed a makeshift time machine, the disabled T- 8000 chip is all that was needed to complete the activation of it, the plan is to travel to 1997 to prevent Judgement Day and Skynet becoming self-aware, but Kyle is convinced that time has been altered due to his childhood vision, he persuades Sarah to travel to 2017 to stop Skynet. In 2017 Sarah and Kyle materialise together in the middle of a busy San Francisco highway and are arrested by police, while treated for their injuries they find out that Skynet is called ""Genisys"", an upcoming global operating system being embraced by the public. They are shocked by the appearance of John Connor, he rescues them, but is immediately shot by the Guardian, John is revealed to have become a T-3000 nanomachine hybrid. John explains that shortly after Kyle was transported through time he was infected by Skynet, operating as a T-5000, posing as a member of the Resistance, called Alex (Doctor Who's Matt Smith), John has been tasked with ensuring Cyberdyne Systems survival and assist the development of Genisys. Sarah, Kyle and the Guardian escape to a safe house to make final preparations to destroy Cyberdyne's Genisys mainframe, they head to Cyberdyne headquarters, with the T-3000 in close pursuit, the Guardian dive-bombs into the T- 3000's helicopter, causing it to crash, but the T-3000 survives and advances the countdown to the launch of Genisys from 13 hours to 15 minutes. Kyle, Sarah and the Guardian plant bombs around the facility, the T-3000 attacks, but the Guardian traps the T-3000 in the magnetic field of a prototype time machine, both are destroyed, but the Guardian's head was thrown into an experimental vat of mimetic polyalloy, the liquid metal the T-1000 was made of. Kyle and Sarah managed to escape the explosion set off by the bombs successfully preventing Genisys coming online, and the Guardian appears having been upgraded by the liquid metal components, he helps them out of the debris. The trio travels to the childhood home of young Kyle (Bryant Prince), there Kykle tells his younger self about Genisys and to repeat a warning to memorise, critical insurance leading to the events in 2017, Sarah, Kyle and the Guardian drive off into the country, however it is revealed in the mid-credits that the system core of Genisys located in a hidden underground chamber has survived the explosion. Also starring J.K. Simmons as O'Brien, Courtney B. Vance as Miles Dyson, Sandrine Holt as Detective Cheung and Dayo Okeniyi as Danny Dyson. Schwarzenegger still packs a punch as three versions of the Terminator, including with digital trickery, Clarke is not quite as feisty as Linda Hamilton, but isn't bad, Courtney is slightly bland, and in his short time Byung-hun Lee is a creditable T-1000. I did like the film for all its great fast-paced sequences, filled with chases, guns and explosions, all brought to life by great but slightly unimaginative CGI effects, it is not directly a sequel, it is a more starting all over again, the story is a little over-complicated, with complex jargon and parallel universes changed by time, but it's not the most terrible science-fiction action thriller. Okay!",Terminator Genisys
10,ma-cortes,"Exhilarating installment in the notorious series with noisy action ,breathtaking fights , nail-biting pursuits , and abundant special effects",7,14 September 2018,"The continuing saga of humanity's war with the machines who are run by Skynet the artificial intelligence that decided that humanity needs to be eradicated. John Connor (Jason Clarke), the one leading the human rebels against Skynet, has a scheme to destroy Skynet . As the tough leader of the human resistance sends Sgt. Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) and safeguard the future, an incredible turn of deeds creates a fractured time-line . Then , a futuristic and menacing cyborg suitably robotic is also sent to present-day Earth . But they are mercilessly pursued by the ominious robot, ultimate killing machine Cop / T-1000 (Byung-Hun Lee) to avoid to live the hero destinated to become the great liberator . There also appears Guardian , the old hunk , called the grandfather , Arnold Schwarzenegger , to reckoning with the past and future . Realizing their nightmare isn't over, they decide to stop running and focus on preventing the developing of Skynet. ¨The rules have been reset¨. 
 Nice follow-up with frenetic action , thrills , tension and suspense from start to finish . Interesting and twisted screenplay by Patrick Lussier based on characters created byJames Cameron .& 
Gale Anne Hurd . Pacing is just right in this thrilling and exhilarating non-stop action movie . There's a welcome sprinkling of deadpan humor to bring you relief from the bludgeoning action too . This is the first film in the series to not feature animatronic Terminators created by special effects artist Stan Winston, due to his death in 2008. Instead, the animatronics were created by effects studio Legacy Effects, an enterprise formed out of Winston's former workshop staff. An explosive thriller with Arnie repeating his known lines as ¨I'll be back¨ . Arnie develops enough traits and command of slang to bring additional veins of laughs to the almost un-stoppable and noisy action . And other cold-blooded villian on the starring's trail well played by Byung-Hun Lee as Cop / T-1000 . The twists and turns of time and logic will amaze you almost as much as the liquid metal effects and the highway chases . The important main cast formed by Arnold Schwarzenegger , Jason Clarke , Emilia Clarke , Jai Courtney are well accompanied by a notorius support cast such as J.K. Simmons , Dayo Okeniyi , Matt Smith ,Courtney B. Vance , Gregory Alan Williams , Sandrine Holt and Byung-Hun Lee . It packs a thrilling and moving musical score by Lorne Balfe . As well as a colorful and evocative cinematography by Kramer Morgenthau . The motion picture was professionally directed by Alan Taylor (Thor .: The dark world , Game of thrones) .

11,BA_Harrison,"Old, and quite possibly obsolete.",4,19 May 2017,"For a film that features the paradox of time travel, The Terminator was fairly easy to follow. Terminator 2: Judgment Day had a more complex plot, but still didn't strain my brain. Likewise, Terminator 3 wasn't that much of a challenge to keep track of. And the only puzzling thing about Terminator Salvation was how they made such a mediocre movie out of a once very entertaining franchise.Terminator Genisys, on the other hand, is so ridiculously convoluted that it proves virtually impossible to decipher. From the moment Kyle Reese lands in an alternate 1984 where he is attacked by a T-1000, I was completely lost, the story a blustering incoherent shambles that just gets more and more perplexing as it careens towards its inconclusive climax.As far as the cast go, Jai Courtney is bland beefcake, Emilia Clarke is very attractive but rather wooden, and Arnold is Arnold. No-one comes out of this looking great, the real stars of the show being the special effects laden set-pieces.The action scenes, of which there are plenty, might have made up somewhat for the labyrinthine plot, but they are so far-fetched that its impossible to connect with them. At one point, a school bus does a 360 degree flip through the air, landing with a massive crash, only to end up hanging off the edge of the Golden Gate Bridge; both driver and passenger survive. Similarly, a helicopter chase pushes credibility to the limits. I know that one must suspend disbelief with this kind of film, but Terminator Genisys asks way too much of its audience.After the disappointing Christian Bale entry, I really wanted to like this film, hoping it would get the series back on track, but I actually ended up liking it less than Salvation.",Terminator Genisys
12,paul_haakonsen,But why?...,6,9 June 2018,"Visually a great treat for the eyes, which is essentially summarizing the entirety of the movie.I wasn't much fan of the re-writing of the entire storyline that was built up throughout the previous movies in the ""Terminator"" franchise. It was just respectless to just take the entire franchise and storyline as remold it into this mess of a storyline.Arnold Schwarzenegger did a good job in reprising his role, and Byung-hun Lee was phenomenal as a T-1000. But it was downright ridiculous that they recast Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. And lets be honest as neither Emilia Clarke or Jai Courtney were up to the task, not even close to it.Watch this movie for entertainment value only and disregard it entirely as a proper entry to the ""Terminator"" franchise. Think of it as a 'what if...' approach to the franchise.",Terminator Genisys
13,michaelRokeefe,Prequel to the legend,7,7 July 2018,"Critics might want to jump all over this, but damn, jump back Jack! This movie has more than enough to keep you in your seat. The struggle continues between the ravaged and scrambled human race and dominance of terminator cyborgs. This prequel to the Terminator unravels a much different back story for Sarah Connor, mother of the Resistance hero John Connor. It is time travel for Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) to journey back to 1984 to protect Sarah (Emilia Clarke). There is a new stylish storyline that doesn't insult your intelligence, more than enough powerful action scenes, loud and super special effects...plus a laugh or two. A lot revolves around the Guardian (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and get this, a smart phone that actually proves to be a very smart phone. TERMINATOR GENISYS is better than you may think. MIss Clarke is not just another pretty face; she makes Sarah Connor everything you want her to be. Also featured in the cast: Jason Clarke, J.K. Simmons, Michael Gladis, Courtney B. Vance and Dayo Okenlyi.",Terminator Genisys
14,sunwarrior13,Arnold Is Back But Is That Enough To Resurrect The Franchise?,5,14 December 2019,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is back in the fourth sequel of the Terminator franchise series entitled,""Terminator Genisys"". He co-stars with Jason Clarke, Emilia Clarke, Jai Courtney, J. K. Simmons, Dayo Okeniyi, Matt Smith, Courtney B. Vance, and Lee Byung-hun.The story involves Kyle Reese,a soldier in the post-apocalyptic future with a war involving the human race against the machines led by Skynet. Apparently,Reese is sent from 2029 to 1984 by John Connor,who is the leader of the Human Resistance, to protect his mother,Sarah. But to Kyle's surprise,he discovers than the timeline has been changed and Sarah has been raised by r Terminator that has been reprogrammed.No question that we get to see Arnold once again in his familiar role as the Terminator. Added to that,the fans will be entitled with the great visual effects brought about during the time it was released. The action is great. But what about the story? Or better yet, does the return of Arnold enough to bring the new movie into new heights after he was not in the previous sequel known as ""Terminator Salvation""? No question that for some hardcore Terminator fans,the return of Arnold is enough.Too bad that the franchise was ruined in this new Terminator film as the saga was been completely altered which made the events of the first four Terminator films irrelevant and complete pointless.Added to that, we also see the complete downward trajectory of the franchise as it lost its heart completely.Overall,this new film brought the Terminator franchise completely. Good thing that ""Terminator:Dark Fate"" was released in 2019. But apparently,it was presented as continuation of the first two Terminator film - Terminator (1984) and Terminator:Judgement Day (1991) - as it basically tried to completely ignore the other sequels of the franchise such as ""Terminator 3:Rise Of The Machines"" (2003), ""Terminator Salvation"" (2009), and this film known as ""Terminator Genisys"" (2015).",Terminator Genisys
15,bevo-13678,More,10,25 June 2020,Another terminator movie. Probably similar story line to any other one.,Terminator Genisys
16,Theo Robertson,Come With Me If You Want To See Matt Smith In A Total Mess Again,4,2 July 2015,"Away back in 1984 James Cameron brought us THE TERMINATOR which I consider to be the great science fiction film of the 1980s . A low budget indie film with a very high concept and one of the tightest screenplays you will ever see . With hindsight one of the reasons was it owed a lot to John Carpenter and Cameron and Hemdale found themselves in hot water with Harlan Ellison who took out a lawsuit claiming plagiarism , a lawsuit that was settled out of court . Despite the controversy the original film has stood the test of time and still shows that a great screenplay makes for a great film . That as the problem with all the sequels - they sacrificed intelligence for spectacle and despite the second film having a massive amount of fans who rate it the highlight of the franchise I found it overblown and meandering . Truth be told the original movie doesn't lend itself to a long running franchise . GENISYS might just prove my point !!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!! If you've seen the trailer then unfortunately you've seen the film . Not the whole film of course because the trailer contains all the best bits . And runs for two minutes . And the whole film runs for two hours . How's your arithmetic ? If nothing else the trailer is a marketing success since it'll intrigue you as to how it ties in with the previous four films and then it'll kick you in the teeth by totally disposing of everything that happened in these movies while slavishly and unimaginatively recreating many of the same set pieces from the previous movies . Sarah Connor is still the mother of John but now she's best friends with a T-800 now called ""Pops"" who is her guardian angel and they're now time travelers who flit between alternative time-lines which doesn't begin to make the slightest bit of sense . I had to constantly keep checking with this site to see if Steven Moffat was behind any of this because the film plays out like one of his DOCTOR WHO scripts that's painfully convoluted and gives the impression it's being written as it's going along . Internal logic is totally ignored such as a character referring to microwave ovens despite the character being too young to have known a time when microwave ovens were in existence Everyone can make up there own mind towards the cast but gut instinct tells me that if you remember Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn from the original you will instantly dislike Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney as their replacements . Courtney especially is dreadful but to be fair to the actor he's nothing more than a plot device in a film and is written with that function in mind . Compare him to Biehn and he's playing an entirely different character . Arnie is Arnie but you're left thinking it's one last pay day before he walks off in to the sunset and the much anticipated casting of Matt Smith is disappointing since he's reduced to a walk on part but he'll feel at home in this mess of a movie . The only decent performance is by Jason Clarke as John Connor and that's probably by default In summary TERMINATOR GENISYS is a cynical money making exercise by Hollywood to ditch the previous movies and start all over again . Despite the lawsuit by Harlan Ellison the original TERMINATOR owed much to the 1972 DOCTOR WHO story Day Of The Daleks . GENESISYS is similar because it owes much to the Matt Smith / Steven Moffat era of DOCTOR WHO . Don't be surprised if the next film in the franchise sees Sarah Connor battling a middle aged Scotsman",Terminator Genisys
17,Scarecrow-88,Terminator Genisys,7,6 July 2015,"I really wish those critical of this film (and I'm guessing before even seeing it, some of them) would pull that stick out of your ass and just have some fun. The use of Arnold in this newest film in the franchise is so inspired and admirable. Seeing an older ""fleshed"" version of Arnold engaged in combat with his ""84 self"" is a really wild bit of an action sequence, as is Sarah Connor (played by Game of Thrones beauty, Emily Clarke) getting to utter the immortal line, ""Come with me if you wanna live"" to the man supposed to be *her savior*, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney, this time not playing a muscleheaded asshole for a change). It is all a riot. I went in a definite Terminator fan, and this newest film didn't turn me off or repulse me at all. It was actually designed to be a popcorn summer blockbuster and doesn't disappoint. The hospital sequence where the nano-tech John Connor emerges and will combat Arnold, ""commanded by Skynet"" to halt Sarah and Kyle's efforts to destroy Skynet and forbid nuclear holocaust which would start in San Francisco. If one dwells on the time paradox/alternate versions they are liable to get a headache (how Kyle as an adult can confront his child self is a head scratcher I can't even gloss over), and seeing Arnold still around after the day seems saved left me pondering how it was possible. Still it was really neat seeing the liquid metal Terminator after Kyle in 1984, and all three (Arnie's Terminator Guardian, Kyle, and Sarah) together stopping it from completing its programming. The nano-tech Skynet version of John Connor, and how he's impervious to all kinds of attach is a real special effects dynamo (it is nonsense how so many criticize the effects; I thought they were quite good). The bus on the Golden Gate Bridge as John causes it to flip, with Arnie coming to the rescue after being thrown out of it and onto a police car is a big wow. I'm hoping this picks up better business along the way and those so harsh against it will eat their words, but sadly, it appears as if Genisys might not recover the needed profit in the United States it'll need to get critics from riding its ass. And for those who claim this has no depth or feeling: I say poppycock. Arnold's ""elder cyborg"" and Emily Clarke's Sarah have this wonderful ""father/daughter"" dynamic that has plenty of heart and soul. Clarke isn't no T2 Linda Hamilton Connor, but she's still a feisty, courageous, and assertive heroine just the same. Courtney isn't Michael Biehn, but he too does a decent job of bringing a humanity and personal responsibility to his Kyle Reese. Arnold might be at an advanced age, but he still has bucketloads of charisma and is in incredible shape. His smiling bit is a real giggle. Plenty of action even at its PG-13 rating, except most of the violence is damage to cyborgs not humans. JK Simmons is an absolute hoot as a cop from 84 who survived and might just be able to return the favor in 2017. He has the best comic bits in the film. A police station sequence that feeds into the helicopter chase is another fine bit of action, with Simmons a major part of this before the whirlybirds take flight. Matt Smith of Doctor Who fame is a major reason Skynet might just remain intact, and his Terminator initiates the nano- tech John Connor that causes our heroes so much trouble.",Terminator Genisys
18,LeonLouisRicci,Awful ActingUltra-ConfusingFun-Filled Eye Candy but a Brain Drain,6,25 March 2016,"The enormous Amount of Action and Whizzing and Banging on display in this ""Reboot"" is enough to carry the Movie for those that like that sort of thing. It's all ""State of the Art"" as They say and is Paraded out in every Super-Hero/Sci-Fi Big Budget ""Summer Blockbuster"" and has become as Predictable as a Paycheck used to be.Used to be, these were supreme Eye Candy Extravaganzas that Awed Audiences and put People in the seats and Money in someone's pocket. So here We have another Reboot/Sequel/Prequel or who Knows what with ""The Arnold"" back as the original Human/Friendly ""Guardian"". Well, at least that's slightly Interesting.But the Two Youngsters (who now call Arnold ""Pops"", Sheesh!) are such Bad Actors that even the overwhelming CGI can't overwhelm the Awful Performances from these Two stiffs. They both could be contenders for the Worst Acting in a Major Motion Picture, EVER.Here's a Warning. If You decide to give this one a go, for the Love of keeping Your Intellect Intact, do not even try to keep up with the Script as it Furiously and with all Futility, tries to explain the Plot because the Splitting Roads of the Timelines will result in a Splitting Headache. It's better to just Kick-Back and to say, No Mas. Overall, Worth a Watch except for those that take the Terminator Series Seriously or Think that it Stopped at #2.

19,CinemaSerf,"Poor, stolid, sequel that falls pretty flat.",6,3 August 2020,"To be fair to this effort, for a while it does hark back to the original two films and elicits a little nostalgia for when the ""Terminator"" films were a ""must see"". Sadly, though that doesn't last for very long and we are soon back in the repetitious, though admittedly fast paced, ""John Connor"" versus ""Skynet"" scenario. This time Jason Clarke takes up the ""Connor"" mantle determined to stop the all-powerful conglomerate from undoing all the good work he, mother ""Sarah"" (in this iteration, Emilia Clarke) and Arnie have done thus far. When this cunning plan comes to nought, he sends his lieutenant ""Reese"" (Jai Courtney) back in time to protect ""Sarah"" and together, along with her ""Guardian"" (Arnie) they must evade a whole new breed of ""Terminator"" sent to eliminate her before she can conceive and give birth to their nemesis. This really does lack any sense of peril or menace, the story moves along well enough but none of the performances really catch fire. The effects are good enough, but the dialogue is pretty poor and the romance that develops between Clarke & Courtney just gets in the way. Made for the sake of it, this one, and that's a shame...",Terminator Genisys
20,utgard14,"""Time travel makes my head hurt.""",5,10 November 2015,"That line from Jai Courtney in this movie pretty much sums it up. While it's not a total trainwreck or as emotionally uninvolving as Terminator Salvation, it is confusing as hell and you never quite know what the point of it all is. Are they trying to wrap up loose ends? Reboot the whole series? Just make another cash-grab sequel? Does it really matter? Let's put aside any notion that this movie ever could have compared to the James Cameron films. That would have been virtually impossible and, really, asking far too much from it. All I really wanted was for it to be an entertaining movie that didn't require me to be the biggest Terminator nerd on the planet to ""get"" it. Well, on that level, it fails miserably. This was a movie made for the initiated fanboys of the Terminator franchise, not for the average viewer who had either never seen a Terminator movie or had only seen the first two. This begs the question: if this was indeed meant to restart the franchise, why did they make this so inaccessible to those who weren't already die-hard fans? It clearly failed to appeal to those fans anyway since so many of them seem to hate this with a passion. This seems like it was doomed from the start.The best part of the movie is Arnold Schwarzenegger. I was not looking forward to him playing the Terminator again. Watching aging stars trying to relive past glories is often just sad and pathetic. But he is the highlight of this, anchoring the movie and giving it most of its humor and heart. I loved the father/daughter dynamic between ""Pops"" and Sarah, despite knowing if I thought about it too long it might not make much sense. For her part, Emilia Clarke approaches the role of Sarah Connor with a great deal of enthusiasm but, sadly, she is terribly miscast for the part. She has a likability about her and a nice chemistry with Arnold but, physically, she's this tiny babyfaced woman who looks a decade younger than her 29 years. She looks like a little girl playing dress-up in her mom's clothes. I was not surprised to see that Jai Courtney stinks up the place. I truly wish Hollywood would stop trying to make Jai Courtney happen. How many franchises does this dull, cardboard actor have to bury? Jason Clarke makes for the creepiest John Connor to date, even before we get to one of the movie's more disappointing plot twists. Matt Smith gets a crucial role but, unfortunately, very little screen time. J.K. Simmons has a pointless part in this thing, providing comic relief and little else. Does anyone know what the point of his character was? I have the feeling some of his scenes were left on the cutting room floor. I really don't know what possessed him to do this but I hope he was paid well.The special effects in this are passable but not the greatest. The effects of the younger Arnold from the first film (accomplished through CGI) are dreadful. None of the set pieces impress. Nothing about this stands out in any significant way. The plot is overstuffed and twisty in the worst ways. More emphasis is put on spectacle and recalling past Terminator films (yes all the lines you are expecting are here) than crafting nice character moments. The best we get in that regard are the scenes between Pops and Sarah. I don't think it's the complete disaster others are calling it, but I do think it's a misfire. The movie ends with some unanswered questions but also a bit of closure. So I'm not sure if the plan is to make more of these or start over. Frankly I could go another couple of decades without a Terminator movie, but something tells me they won't leave well enough alone.",Terminator Genisys
21,zardoz-13,"The ""Terminator"" We've Been Waiting For!!!",10,6 July 2015,"The latest entry in the ""Terminator"" franchise ""Terminator: Genisys"" ranks as the best ""Terminator"" since James Cameron's ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" (1991). Although Jonathon Mostow's ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" (2003) and McG's ""Terminator Salvation"" (2009) each presented serviceable sagas, neither film boasted the impressive scope and spectacle of ""Terminator Genisys."" Incidentally, I preferred ""Terminator Salvation"" over ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines."" Anyway, fans of James Cameron's first two ""Terminator"" thrillers will be delighted to know that Cameron has endorsed ""Terminator Genisys"" as ""the official third film in the franchise."" The fifth ""Terminator"" installment welcomes back Austrian bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger as yet another Terminator. No, he is not the same one that he was in either ""The Terminator"" (1984) or ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" This time Arnold appears as a Guardian Terminator that our feisty heroine affectionately refers to as ""Pops."" Arnold's CGI image from the original ""Terminator"" makes a cameo appearance early in ""Terminator: Genisys."" Interestingly, these two titans—the young Schwarzenegger and the elder-- tangle at one point. Of course, you should take it for granted who emerges triumphant. The fifth ""Terminator"" movie pays tribute to the original with a rehash of the Griffith Observatory scene. Meantime, ""Thor: The Dark World"" director Alan Taylor with ""Shutter Island"" scenarist Laeta Kalogridis and ""Drive Angry"" scribe Patrick Lussier have wrought some widespread changes to the franchise that may either exasperate or gratify hardcore ""Terminator"" enthusiasts. The fifth ""Terminator"" movie ignores the events in both ""Terminator 3 and ""Terminator Salvation."" Nevertheless, ""Terminator Genisys"" emerges by far as the most audacious and compelling of the last three ""Terminator"" epics. This spectacular, $155 million dollar, PG-13 rated, science fiction fantasy generates considerable momentum while it delivers surprises galore that should keep most spectators guessing about the characters and the outcome. Mind you, Taylor and company don't resolve all issues, particularly the end credits clip of a sinister Skynet weapon warming up. If you prefer happy endings, ""Terminator: Genisys"" won't disappoint you with its feel-good finale. ""Lawless"" actor Jason Clarke has appropriated the adult John Connor role that actors Nick Stahl and Christian Bale incarnated previously in ""Terminator 3"" and ""Terminator Salvation."" Aussie actor Jai Courtney has taken over the Kyle Reese role originated by Michael Biehn in ""The Terminator"" and later reinterpreted by Anton Yelchin in ""Terminator Salvation.""If you've never seen a ""Terminator"" movie, you'll have to pay attention to the expository laden dialogue because there is a lot to explain in ""Terminator: Genisys."" ""Terminator"" aficionados, however, may suffer more than newbies because Taylor and his writers have changed up virtually everything. Moviegoers often complain that sequels retread the same old stuff one sequel after another. ""Terminator: Genisys"" doesn't depart drastically from anything else that Cameron and other directors have delivered in the past. Of course, it is still incredibly difficult to terminate a terminator, but Taylor and company have come up with a clever way to execute this practically impossible task. Nevertheless, at the same time, to refresh the franchise, they have altered the time lines, so traditional ""Terminator"" fans may find themselves struggling to assimilate these radical changes. For example, ""Terminator: Genisys"" opens with scar-faced John Connor (Jason Clarke) and his right-hand man Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney of ""Spartacus: War of the Damned"") defeating Skynet until they discover a time-travel machine that Skynet has kept in reserve should things go awry. Although they have defeated the Machines, our heroes learn that the Machines have sent a lone Terminator (Schwarzenegger lookalike body-builder Brett Azar) back to 1984 to murder Sarah Connor before she can give birth to her son John Connor. No sooner has this occurred than Connor dispatches volunteer Kyle Reese after the Terminator. Anybody who climbs into a ""Terminator"" time travel machine must be completely naked. Otherwise, as one technician explains, it would be like sticking tin-foil into a micro-wave and watching everything burst into flames. Kyle shows up in 1984 in newly lensed footage that replicates similar footage filmed by Cameron for the original. Predictably, Kyle scrambles to gather apparel, including those Nikes, when he runs afoul of a T-1000 (Lee Byung-hun of ""Red 2"") that wants to carve him into deli slices with his sword-shaped limbs. Seasoned ""Terminator"" aficionados will recall Robert Patrick performed similar feats in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" Two LAPD cops arrests Kyle, but the T-1000 attacks all three of them. The frightened patrolman who survives the encounter turns Kyle loose. At this suspenseful juncture, Kyle meets Sarah Connor. She isn't the same Sarah that he was prepared to protect from the Terminator. Instead, this Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke of ""Game of Thrones"") knows how to wield a wide variety of firearms. Naturally, this dire change of events stuns Kyle. Worse, he isn't prepared to see Sarah working in tandem with another Terminator who has raised her since her mother and father were murdered. Later, Kyle surprises Sarah in turn when he convinces her that Judgment Day will not take place in 1997, but twenty years later in 2017. Nevertheless, Kyle experiences paranoia at the sight of the Guardian Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who has been safeguarding Sarah since age nine. Our hero and heroine climb into a time displacement device that Sarah and her Guardian have rigged up and land on a crowded freeway in 2017. Predictably, the LAPD arrest them, but our heroes receive the shock of their lives when salvation comes not from the Guardian Terminator, but from another unexpected source.Clocking in at almost two hours, ""Terminator: Genisys"" bristles with larger-than-life, hyper-kinetic derring-do. The somersaulting school bus on the Golden Gate Bridge qualifies as a spectacular stunt. Director Alan Taylor shifts back and forth between the past and the future with relative ease, and everything is explained so nothing seems too obtuse except what will be cleared up eventually in future ""Terminator"" sequels."" Sturdy but polished production values, first-rate widescreen cinematography, and inspired scriptwriting all highlight director Alan Taylor's memorable outing.",Terminator Genisys
22,grantss,Please...stop,3,2 May 2016,"It is 2029. Since 1997 humans have been engaged in a life-or-death struggle with the robots of Skynet. One of the leaders of the human forces is John Connor (played by Jason Clarke). He sends Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to 1984 to protect his mother, Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke). Upon arriving in 1984 he discovers that Sarah Connor already has a protector, a largely-obsolete robot / Terminator (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger). However, Skynet has also sent back a Terminator.And that is pretty much where any pretense of plot ended. It was pretty much all over the place to start off with, and seemed simply like a rehash of Terminator 1, with a bit of Terminator 2 thrown in. After this it becomes quite random and complex, just for complexity sake. Despite the complexity it is actually quite empty, plot-wise: the movie is really about the action scenes and special effects.Performances are okay, but this isn't a character-driven movie so they hardly matter. Emilia Clarke is about the only reason to watch this movie but Khaleesi deserves better than appearing in schlock like this...Interesting to note that, even though this is a Hollywood movie, the main four actors are all non-American: two Australians, an Englishwoman and an Austrian (though Arnie could be considered American now...).I was never a great fan of the Terminator franchise. I found the original Terminator entertaining but thought all the others were so- so or bad. Every movie since Terminator 3 has felt like a rehash of what came before and hasn't really added anything. After the disappointment of Terminator Salvation I would have thought that was the end of the road for the series, but, alas, no.

24,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Determined systematic regeneration: achieved,8,26 June 2015,"The only way to beat the robot army is to stop it from preventing us from defeating it. Of course this means going through the time-machine just used by the cyborg Terminator(which we get a lot of cool bits with, including two of them going head-to-head... albeit the T1000 all over the trailers is barely in this, and there are definite anti-climactic, even, very 2010's, pointless, fights) infiltrator hit-man, which here, has not been reprogrammed. And then, it gets complicated. John(Clarke, giving us a credible, and genuinely, and earned, trustworthy leader; poor him, on guy 5, or 6 depending on whether you count both from the '91 one, and barely ever looking similar twice), appears, adult, before the future. Healing his trademarked face-scar, without even requiring copious amounts of cocaine, he reveals himself the main antagonist - so the internet can officially calm right the heck down. They didn't blow a twist, they revealed that this had an actual plot, and this is coming from someone who looked forward to this from the first glimpse of it, and is tremendously satisfied with it.If you hate the idea of the core structure of the first three being used again, nothing in this will change your mind. Next you'll tell me that something not using that same formula would feel like part of this franchise, and that suggesting otherwise wasn't actually one of Salvation's seemingly countless problems. They didn't even bring back Arnie, who everyone wants on the silver screen in each of these. Offer him a mere cameo?! Who do you think you are, anyway? Sly? And yes, this is a reboot. Go in blind, you'll just find out parts of the canon over the course of it. You will appreciate this more if you do know... don't recall, not into rewatching the others? Skim Wiki for it. This plays with iconic scenes from the original two, using them as jump-off points for the storyline that deviates from them, and paying them respect, or, depending on your perspective, lazily rip them off. If you're in the latter camp, this won't win you over.How do you justify going back to revisit familiar ground? What did T2 even, and what does this, do? Approach it from a new angle, and toy with already beloved elements, and, giving the audience, surprises, keep us guessing and render it relevant to, again. The four main characters return, with not a single one of them the same as we've seen them before. Kyle(Courtney, making up for not remotely resembling Biehn physically by otherwise doing his performance justice, moreso than any other... maybe they should have gotten a guy whose appearance vastly differs from his much sooner) is out of the (time?) loop, albeit, The Butterfly Effect-style, retaining memories of this alternate timeline that, along with his expertise in combat and strategy, now shared by his allies from the past, makes him invaluable, rather than leave him as ""just present"" as Wolverine in The Days of Future Past. Pops(Schwarzenegger, able, game and fun as ever) is a parental figure, yet now having lived in that role for about a decade. And he now took that over from the, again, off-screen-killed mother of... Sarah(only on the third talent, having swapped one spot-on take by a Game of Thrones actress for another, always retaining one demeanor). She's had little contact with other humans ever since, and their father-daughter relationship is humorous, real, and, yes touching. This has real heart, and this dysfunctional family gradually finds more common ground and come to care deeply about these not-as-expected people they've known for years, mostly without the other actually being something other than a memory.The action setpieces are big, memorable and, without seeming false, carefully crafted. Each part of the mythos is reintroduced in a cute, and seldom forced, way. ""No fate"", the Dysons, abilities, motifs, every. Single. Thing. Irony is used to keep the known from feeling stale. The pace knows how to balance these massive stakes, powerful individuals and plentiful detail with letting us breathe every so often. A two hour running time feels just right. The 3D, adding some atmosphere, and occasionally depth, still ultimately feels like a post-conversation, and can easily be done without.There is some moderate to strong language and a lot of bloodless, intense combat in this. I recommend this to anyone not put off, perhaps even drawn in, by the conceit propelling this forward. 8/10",Terminator Genisys

And that's why this movie is so upsetting.I'm going to come off as the old curmudgeon and I don't care. How can they do this? Why would they do this? Do you go adding lipstick to the Mona Lisa thinking that it will make her more modern and pretty? Do you go adding arms to the Venus De Milo? Terminator was finished, it was complete, it was a classic in no need of reforming or reparation.Terminator Genisys is an alternate time line for Sarah Connor, John Connor and the entire world. Of course, whenever they make a new terminator movie they have to bring an updated version of the killer machine. T100 in T2, T-X in T3, Salvation was a one off and then they come back with a nameless brand in Genisys that's better than all of its predecessors. Regardless of the newest death robot the point remains that they are trying to rewrite history and for what? More money? Immortality? What? And never mind the can of worms that has been opened. Whenever you start exploring alternate time lines you create endless possibilities and endless problems. Maybe that's what they want but it stinks to me.I want to try to look at this movie as an isolated entity but I can't. I cannot divorce my knowledge of the past in order to view this movie as a stand alone and judge it on its own merit. There is some cool CGI, some nice fight scenes and plenty of destruction but all action movies have that nowadays.

When Reese arrives, however, he finds that Sarah already has a protector...This is the 5th entry in the Terminator series. One and Two were James Cameron's work. One was a stunningly effective high-concept, low budget effort which set Arnold Schwarzenegger's star in the ascendant as the eponymous implacable, unstoppable murder machine, although it is worth remembering the role-reversal subtext in which, by the end, Sarah has become Kyle's protector. Two, possibly the best sequel ever, showcased state-of-the-art CGI and both homaged and developed the first film. Three and Four had their good points but are hardly essential watching.Film number Five returns to the events of the first two films, and sells us a recreation of the opening sequence from the first movie, where a young Schwarzenegger T800 Terminator (rendered youthful via CGI) arrives naked and brutally obtains clothes before going off on his mission. In this film, he is interrupted by another T800, played by Scharzenegger at his current age – ""Old, but not obsolete,"" we are reminded more than once. There are many nods to the originals, but this film nonetheless does its own thing, visiting at least 4 time zones as it tells its twisty story of alternate timelines.It isn't a match for One and Two, but it is far superior to Three and Four. Scharzenegger, playing T800s at 3 different ages, has fun, and Emilia Clarke convincingly plays a Sarah Conner who would have resulted had the Linda Hamilton version had a different life. There are some terrific uses of the two main music cues from the series, particularly the 5-note percussion cue, and there is one very touching moment which suffers only from being logically unjustifiable in terms of established information.The 3D is completely unessential.I thoroughly enjoyed this, but was never under the impression in was anything more than a popcorn movie.",Terminator Genisys

And it was....up to a point. For about 40 minutes or so, I appreciated the homages of ""Genisys"" to the original (and still one-of-a-kind) ""Terminator"", including the almost completely accurate reconstructions of some of its iconic scenes. The movie starts going downhill after the major ""twist"" about John Connor is revealed (by the way, if you have seen this twist spoiled in the trailers and the posters of the film and reasonably expect ANOTHER major twist coming after it, you would be mistaken - this twist is ALL there is!). After this point, ""Genisys"" becomes a rehash, mostly of ""Terminator 2"", but with ideas from the other earlier films thrown in as well (and it never bothers answering some pretty big questions). The ""new"" threat is roughly 90% a copy of the ""liquid metal"" model from T2. The action scenes are loud and overblown, but not particularly exciting; the helicopter chase was done better in T2, the bus chase was done better in T3 (not with an actual bus, but you get the point). The new Sarah Connor and the new Kyle Reese are OK but no match for the earlier actors who played those roles. As for Arnold himself, they should remove the title ""Terminator"" from this character, because he wouldn't even terminate a fly by this point; he has become a cute and cuddly teddy bear (to be fair, T2 started paving the road for that development). Honestly, I think Matt Smith, who appears in about 3 scenes in total, gives the best performance in the film (and it has nothing to do with the fact that I recently discovered him through ""Doctor Who""). Ultimately, ""Genisys"" is not a patch on its movie predecessors OR the TV series ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles"".

It begins in the future where humanity is under threat by machines. War has broke out and John Connor is leading the retaliation. A time machine becomes available and fellow soldier Kyle Reese volunteers to go back to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor, John's mother. This becomes somewhat confusing when time lines fail to reference previous films correctly. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a staple for these films and he appears in both his 1984 evil form and 1991 Judgement Day hero who goes beyond the call of duty to protect Sarah Connor, played with determination and grit by Emilia Clarke. Kyle Reese is played by Jai Courtney who has not been informed that he is John Connor's father. Jason Clarke plays John who is attacked as Reese is in the process of being transported through the time machine. John is later seen as one of these shape shifting machines that pursues them and this really tests the loyal fans of the franchise. J.K. Simmons appears as someone who is seen as crazy yet he knows what is up when the beings appear in an electric ball on the highway.

As the narrative of the original is homaged, Connor sends Reese back to 1984 to save Connor's mother, Sarah, from a Terminator programmed to kill her so that she won't ever give birth to John. But what Reese finds on the other side is nothing like he expected......Try to understand the very, very incomprehensible plot, and you will begin to dislike the film, very much. But if you take yourself back to a time when Schwarzenegger was the king of the summer blockbuster, there is a lot of fun to be had.Also, if you are looking for a Cameron style return to form for the franchise, you must realise that Cameron made two absolute bona-fide classic science fiction movies with the first two. It was all about the maternal/paternal relationships between people, and everyone knows that Schwarzenegger made his greatest movies with the director.The first 30 minutes of this movie are absolute genius. Special effects are awe-inspiring, and it's a heartfelt tribute to the 1984 original.........and then Pops shows up, bringing Rise Of The Machines with him.From then on, comprehension is out if the window in favour of big bangs, special effects, and a running joke of The Guardian trying to be human in smiling, and being a little pleasant, and this is where popcorn fatigue settles in.Schwarzenegger IS the terminator, and no matter how many silly lines, stupid smiles, or watered down action there is, there's no denying that you cannot help but get a warm, nostalgic feeling when he's being thrown through walls, and becoming more and more damaged.The rest of the cast plod there way through the inane narrative, and yes, if the ridiculous trailer didn't give away intricate spoilers,this would have been more special.For what has become one of the more notorious summer blockbusters of recent times, it's a ride for sure, it's not going to redefine a classic two movie franchise, but it's a damn sight better than Salvation, and ROTM.Just don't expect a game changing movie, just a fun two hours, with your favourite cyborg sending himself up.",Terminator Genisys
32,phd_travel,Entertaining if not wholly comprehensible,7,10 July 2015,"If you don't try to understand completely the confusing time travel plot and just sit back and enjoy it, this movie is entertaining.There is humor from Arnie and a connection to the characters that Terminator has always had. Another welcome return is the morphing liquid metallic thing in pursuit.Casting has hits and misses. Emilia Clarke is quite suited looks wise to fill the impossible to fill shoes of Linda Hamilton. Jai Courtney though not handsome acts earnestly enough. Jason Clarke however is a bit too uncharismatic to play John Connor. Korean actor Lee Byung Hun is a good villain.There is some picturesque and exciting action in San Francisco which seems to feature in every other blockbuster these last few years.Overall it's an over written but enjoyable follow up and worth watching for any fan of the series.",Terminator Genisys
33,Aaron1375,Arnold is back and Conner is played by yet another actor,8,3 July 2015,"Part of me wishes I did not like this film, a small part mind you as I did pay to see this. The reason is so many critics have been harsh with this and a lot of people I know have said it was, ""meh"". So perhaps I had lower expectations and that is why I really enjoyed this film. I most definitely enjoyed it more than the super serious stick up the butt Salvation. This one is not part one or two mind you, but it turned out to be a science fiction/action film that had some laughs and had Arnold back as the Terminator who this time has a name of sorts, ""Pops."" So while the story may not hold up as well as the first two it was a nice action film that for me, was better than the two juggernaut films of the summer of 2015 so far, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and ""Jurassic World"". Just my opinion as I did enjoy those two films a good deal, just enjoyed this one more. I am a Schwarzenegger fan and this is the first film he has done since his political career ended that I have been able to get to other than the Expendable films, so that may be part of it too. That and I enjoy robots and stuff fighting and this has that in it too.The story has Kyle Reese going back into the past to save Sarah Connor from the Terminator. Strangely though, something is amiss as when he arrives a Terminator is waiting for him. Meanwhile, the Terminator who has been sent back to take out Sarah is ambushed and taken out before it has a chance to get some clothes on. Soon Sarah and Kyle are meeting under entirely different circumstances and there is an opening to take out Skynet before it can begin its plans for mass extinction of the human race. Unfortunately, another Terminator is after them now in the form of John Connor.I did have a couple of problems with the film and one of them is the fact John Connor is a Terminator. Not that he is one, but that I knew this before I went to see the film! I am still going to mark the spoiler box, but unless you completely missed the trailers you knew this was going to happen. It would have been a bit cooler had I not found out that tidbit until I was watching the film and Schwarzenegger's Terminator blasted him a couple of times. Not sure what they were thinking with that one and this is one of the reasons I try to avoid trailers all together as they do have spoilers in them a bit more than only a few years ago. The film could have also been rated R, but once again they are just afraid to have a movie with a budget this size and make it R. Granted part of my reasoning for having it R is just so I could have seen Emilia Clarke (Sarah Connor) naked. Otherwise, it was rather a hard PG-13 as there was cussing galore and a couple of good kills too.So while others may not have enjoyed this one, I did. It did some things the same and it did some things differently and it made for a fun ride. I liked how they recreated the 1984 film and I liked how they kept changing the future around as if this film was pretty much what happens when you keep time jumping and that is things really get messed up. Beyond that, this is not a thinker film and it is the summer so nothing wrong with a popcorn action film. So while it is most certainly not universally loved, I liked it and thought it was a cool science fiction/action movie. There was some good humor as well and I really enjoyed Arnold's return to the role. A good movie for me and the people I saw it with, which is all I can ask for.",Terminator Genisys
34,Wuchakk,"Similar to the first three films, but not as good",5,23 August 2015,"""Terminator Genisys"" (2015) is the fifth movie in the Terminator franchise. The plot is an amalgam of the first three movies with cyborgs traveling back in time to kill or save Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) before she gives birth to the leader of the formidable Resistance, John Connor (Jason Clarke). Like the first film, the ""future"" father of John, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney), also goes back in time to inevitably meet and fall in love with Sarah. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to the series as an aging, but not obsolete, Terminator.The fourth film, 2009's ""Terminator Salvation,"" distinguished itself by taking place completely in the post-apocalyptic future where the machine-controlled Skynet is at war with the surviving humans, The Resistance. While different, this installment failed to be compelling because it sacrificed characters for wall-to-wall action and CGI, which resulted in dull overkill.""Terminator Genisys,"" by contrast, tries to mix quality character bits in with the action. Unfortunately, while reminiscent of the first three films, it fails to stack up, copping a ""been there, done that"" vibe. It's like a slick-yet-pale rendition of the first two installments. People criticized the third one (2003) for this very reason, but at least it came within sighting distance of the first two. ""Terminator Genisys"" doesn't even come that close. Still, it's a decently entertaining popcorn flick with some highlights and amusing moments. As for me, I say just watch the first three, particularly the first two. Why waste time with a wannabe? Unless, of course, you're a fan of the series, like me; in that case you basically HAVE to see it.The movie runs 126 minutes and was shot in California and New Orleans.Here's how I grade each of the Terminator outings: T1: A+ T2: A+ T3: B+T4: C T5: C+",Terminator Genisys
35,zetes,"The cast saves it from being terrible (except for Jai Courtney, who sucks)",6,6 July 2015,"Well, I went into this one expecting the worst, so as far as that goes, it wasn't too bad. Not saying much, true. It's the worst of the five Terminator movies, even below the forgettable Salvation. ""Forgettable"" is the perfect adjective for Genisys, as well. In the three days since I've seen it, it's almost completely evaporated from my mind. The cast is what saves it from being bad. Besides Jai Courtney, who plays Kyle Reese and lacks any sort of charisma, everyone is quite good. Okay, Arnold is Arnold, but this is the role Arnold was born to play, so no problems there. Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke does an excellent Linda Hamilton impersonation. Jason Clarke takes over the role of John Connor, and is quite good. J.K. Simmons offers nice support, kind of taking over the psychologist's role from the first two films (not the same character, but he serves the same purpose). I wish they had retained Anton Yelchin from Terminator Salvation for Kyle Reese, because he did a good impersonation of Michael Biehn, but the film seems to want to forget everything from the third and fourth film (not that I blame them, though I prefer both of those to this one). Some of the action sequences are too stupid, but a lot of them are fun, and it doesn't lag too much. The plot is overly convoluted, dealing with time travel and all, but mostly in a fun way. If you're a fan of the series, it might be worth a rental.",Terminator Genisys
36,trashgang,I'm back,7,8 July 2015,"So many negative opinions about the new Terminator. I have seen them all and grew up when Arnie was the big star with his one-liners in terminator (1984). Back then it was the next big thing to watch and even part 2 was a must seen for the effects alone. So I was eager to see this even as it was going to be bad.And see, I watched it until the last second and didn't regret it at all. Was it necessary to reboot terminator, no it wasn't. Is it going to win Oscars, no it won't. It's made for the fans of the franchise and old Arnie is back but he's in it with a kind of humour. If you don't see that throughout this flick you will hate it. The one-liners as 'I'll Be Back' are, no pun intended, back again and naturally it is a must to hear it but just watch the mug shot. The music will ring bells with the older people (won't spoil it) and Arnie showing all his teeth in a funny way, well, don't take it that serious. Of course he do look old but what the hell, he's the terminator and is doing well. Of course we have a bit of compilation of the best of the earlier entries, the robots, the story, even some shots are taken out of the old terminator flicks, did I mind, no at all because you see the young Arnie (all done CGI) confronting himself nowadays. Some people didn't get it and were annoyed by that fact.I was also surprised how much Emilia Clarke (Sarah Connor) do look in some shot like Linda Hamilton (the original Sarah). Of course a lot of eyes were looking toward her acting coming out the much acclaimed Game Of Thrones as Daenerys Targaryen. And she did well, a lot of pressure on her shoulders for that fact but it's okay, she can act.Of course nowadays flicks can't stand with thespians alone, the effects are important too. The Golden Gate Bridge effects are stunning. And the John Connor robot did look stunning too on part of the effects. So after all, not that bad, I even liked it more then Terminator Salvation (2009). If you dig the world of Skynet go watch it even as you never seen a terminator flick before, the compilation at the beginning will update you.

37,deloudelouvain,Not bad but they can stop now.,7,15 October 2015,"Being a fan of the early hours it's a bit difficult to review Terminator Genisys. It's certainly not a bad movie but I wonder just if it was necessary to make another Terminator movie. I mean, how long can you milk that story? That's so typically about American blockbusters. They just don't know when to stop. I thought this movie was really difficult to follow, with the going back and forth to the past and future during the whole movie. But if you like the Terminator movies and you like action then you probably will like this one as well. I did for sure but to me they can just stop now. Enough of the terminators, spend your money in something completely new. Or is the next one Terminator Demented? Because Arnold isn't getting any younger now.",Terminator Genisys
38,Mr-Fusion,"Irritating, but at least it's not as dreary as ""Salvation""",4,13 July 2016,"I'm usually pretty good at suspending disbelief, especially with action movies (there's a balance there), but ""Terminator Genisys"" torpedoed that good-will. Jai Courtney survives both a high-speed collision on the freeway and an airborne school bus crash without injury. And he's not even a Terminator, he's Kyle Reese (yeah, you read that right). Either of those would've killed Reese in the '84 movie, which is when I was officially turned off. You don't have to defer to previous movies, but you do have to respect their rules. ""Genisys"" has no interest in doing so, and it's all about remixing the past and spinning off new timelines with abandon. That in itself might be fun, but it's delivered via dizzying action and shaky cam. No, thanks.Mostly, it's the awful cast. Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney don't belong anywhere near this, and it's hard enough to see Arnold playing a supporting role. I loved J.K. Simmons, but he's in such short supply.I'm not thrilled that Hollywood has gone with fan-fiction as the new reboot trend. First Jurassic Park, then Star Wars and now this. But at least pay some attention to the past before putting it in a blender.",Terminator Genisys
39,siderite,The sequel the franchise deserved,8,9 August 2015,"Terminator 3 was a sham and Terminator 4, while having good special effects, did nothing for the characters and the story. This time, we get it all: special effects, nods to the first two movies, character development, a story that has familiar elements yet spins everything around so that it makes it all fresh and interesting and, most of all, actors that believe in the film. You can see Arnold is having fun and he does justice to his character.Was it perfect? No. It had its small flaws, like continuous action that felt more like a roller-coaster than a real thing, with scenes out of sequence and obvious logic holes... but then again, that is true for all Terminator movies so far and all time travel films in general. It also left some things unexplained, so as to continue the franchise. That was a bit cheap, I feel, just because none of the other films did that.Bottom line: if one ignored the third and fourth Terminator movies, this could have been the perfect end of a trilogy, or at least a third part of the story. I liked it and I believe it to be on par with Terminator 2.Fun facts: Jason Clarke is not really Emilia Clarke's son and Skynet did not steal time travel technology from Doctor Who. Just so you know.",Terminator Genisys
40,namashi_1,Strictly Okay!,5,7 July 2015,"The fifth installment in the Terminator series, 'Terminator Genisys' is a lazy entry to a legendary franchise. Hollywood has been remaking, rebooting & continuing its share of classics since a while now, but I wonder what prompted them to make a new Terminator movie, since the last one was a flop.The prominent problem with 'Terminator Genisys' is its shoddy writing. Though visually dazzling & Arnold returns in his best role yet, the film suffers from a lackluster Screenplay & also inconsistent pacing. At best, its watchable!'Terminator Genisys' Synopsis: John Connor sends Kyle Reese back in time to protect Sarah Connor, but when he arrives in 1984, nothing is as he expected it to be.'Terminator Genisys' has a few exciting moments & the time travel bit does hold some nice nostalgia. I also enjoyed the visual dazzle on display, as well as its excellently choreographed action-sequences. But, ultimately, the film suffers from shoddy writing. Though the film begins promisingly, what follows is a series of predictable & uninspiring moments. The second-hour, in particular, isn't engaging. Laeta Kalogridis & Patrick Lussier's Screenplay needed to be stronger, no two options on that!Alan Taylor's Direction is ordinary. Cinematography is good. Editing is dull, the pacing is inconsistent. Graphics are top-notch. Performance-Wise: Arnold is back & he's game, as always. Jason Clarke as John Connor, is listless. Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor, is hot & tough. Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese, is passable. Lee Byung-hun as a T-1000, has his moments. J. K. Simmons as Detective O'Brien, is wasted.On the whole, 'Terminator Genisys' isn't without its moments, but it could've been way better!",Terminator Genisys
41,MovieAddict2016,How much did they pay James Cameron to talk this up?,3,29 June 2015,"I love Arnold Schwarzenegger. I love the first two ""Terminator"" movies. I was incredibly excited (or optimistic) when it was announced by Megan Ellison that he would be stepping back into his iconic role for what she described as a definitively R-rated, direct sequel to the original films.Ellison is the producer heir who has recently thrown money behind lots of hard-sell films (from P.T. Anderson to Kathryn Bigelow) and has had almost all her gambles pay off. When she departed the project shortly before production and left it to her brother, the less-revered of the siblings (she produced Foxcatcher; he executive-produced GI JOE 2), I saw that as a bad sign. I'm not happy to say that I was right.Many are upset that this is PG-13. While it doesn't bode well for the integrity of the film itself (especially when Megan Ellison boasted about it being a return to adult filmmaking after the PG-13 Terminator Salvation in 2009), I think fanboys in particular tend to be rather petty when it comes to ratings. It is what it is, and there have been many, many excellent PG-13 action films made in the last couple decades. A movie doesn't *need* gratuitous violence and language to be inherently good, and there have been plenty of films that include those elements that ended up being total garbage.Just look at Die Hard 5. It killed John McClane, it killed the Die Hard franchise, and yet it was rated R; the PG-13 Live Free or Die Hard was not only a financially more successful film, it also scored much better with audiences and critics.How apt, then, that the supposed co-star of Die Hard 5, Jai Courtney, is also present in Terminator: Genisys. This is a ""movie star"" who is so devoid of screen presence, so empty and so boring, that it's a wonder why Hollywood has decided in the last couple of years that he should be forced down our throats as the Next Big Thing. He is a poor man's Sam Worthington, and I actually feel bad for Worthington by even saying that. I generally don't ever take a strong dislike to actors, and I'm inclined to give most a chance to prove themselves. But everything I've seen from Courtney has been offensive, from his lazy performances to his arrogant comments off-camera (he had a few choice quotes during the Genisys press tour that I found rather telling of both his lack of respect for the series and his ego), and I went into Genisys hoping it would be the film to prove me wrong about it. Spoiler alert: it wasn't.This guy is supposed to be the new Kyle Reese, previously played by Michael Biehn and Anton Yelchin in the first and fourth films respectively. Terminator Salvation has very few fans, but you know what? It had a strong cast, Yelchin made the character his own to the degree that he could while still honoring Biehn's interpretation, and the movie at least *tried* to give its own spin on the Terminator mythology. Genisys backtracks. It plays with the mythology but doesn't really provide a unique perspective.The movie opens with the future war, which is crammed with plenty of poor CGI sequences. (Another victory for Terminator Salation was that it had a surprisingly cool opening shot of Christian Bale in the helicopter as it crashes and is attacked by a Terminator. This movie doesn't even have that much.)You know the drill by now: Connor sends Reese back in time to save his mother... only when he arrives, everything has changed, and Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) is now a war-ready action heroine, and they are immediately pursued by an Asian T-1000.I won't recap the plot anymore because I will inevitably run out of my 1,000 word limit (Word says I'm getting close). What I will say is that it's here where Arnold comes ""back,"" and yes, he is by far the best part of the film. One almost wonder whether they deliberately sabotaged the movie with two charisma-free leads in Clarke and Courtney so that Ahnuld wouldn't be upstaged.But as much as I love the guy, I had the same issues with him here that I did in Sabotage, the film I thought was most likely to reinvigorate his career until I actually saw it. Simply put, he hasn't aged particularly well, and this shows pretty clearly in the fight scenes; in many, he seems to have been lazily digitally imposed over stunt men, and it's distracting more than anything. He has kind of a creaky, croaky screen presence (something he tried, and failed, to put to good use in Maggie), and although the filmmakers attempt to capitalize upon this by making the new Terminator a ""Guardian"" Father Figure for Sarah (she even refers to him kind of obnoxiously as ""Pops"" throughout the film), we're constantly reminded of how much more fluid and convincing he was in the first two films, both as the menacing, horrific cyborg and as the reprogrammed father figure to John.And that's the ultimate problem with Terminator: Genisys. It has nothing new to say. Despite all its claims to the contrary, it's ultimately spinning the same tale through the prism of the older films, doing nothing other than to remind us of how superior they were. John Connor being turned into the villain (which isn't even a spoiler now since it's on the poster and in the trailer) isn't much different than the original ending to McG's film. The ""Guardian"" being a father to Sarah is no different than the Terminator being a father to John in T- 2. It's not a reboot so much as an homage-packed retreat, following the same beats but lacking the heart and technical ingenuity. This isn't a horrible film, but you know what? T3 was better.",Terminator Genisys
42,KineticSeoul,Fun time travel movie with robots,7,26 July 2015,"Despite this movie being bashed on by some critics. I personally think this movie was pretty good. It isn't the most spectacular and memorable movie, but I had a lot of fun with this installment. Other Terminator movies has time travel in it, but this installment takes it to another level. Where time travel is like the core for the storyline. Sure there are some time paradoxes, but I thought they did some clever twists and directions with this one. Plus it's usually unavoidable when it comes to time travel when it comes to applying it to a movie. I also thought it was clever when it came to how they brought back Arnold. Now I know some audiences had problems with what they did with John Connor and I can understand where they are coming from. Because of what John Connor went through in the previous installments and what he stood for, as this tenacious leader of the resistance. So the direction they went with this didn't make much sense. When it comes to the depth and connection when it comes the the interactions between humans to humans and humans to machines was done fine. Not as good as ""Terminator 2"" but it was fine. There is a lot going on in this movie, especially when it comes to time travel and thus can get slightly confusing at times. All the cast was alright when it came to there roles, Emilia Clarke was good enough to play the younger Sarah Connor, although I thought Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese was a bit odd, not all that bad but odd. Like ""Jurassic World"" they compacted a lot of elements when it came to the plot and action into this. Overall I had a good time with this movie, even if it felt like it started to drag during certain parts. So yeah, it's worth a watch, especially if you like the Terminator franchise.7.5/10",Terminator Genisys
43,OllieSuave-007,"He's back, and better than the last couple of sequels!",8,17 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys is an action packed, thrilling and fast-paced sci-fi flick that is what I think much better than Terminator 3 and Terminator Salvation. This sequel is more in line with the plot elements of the first two films and stays more focused on the continuing mission of defeating Skynet to stop Judgment Day. The main plot point places emphasis on Kyle Reese's (Jai Courtney) mission to save Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) in the year 1984, almost mirroring the events of the first film. However, the suspense builds as nothing is what is expected after Kyle travels back to 1984, and finds himself teaming up with Sarah and a terminator called the Guardian (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to complete his mission.The special effects were decent and the acting was spot-on for the most part. The lack of rapport and the constant bickering between Sarah and Kyle got old throughout the film, but the father-daughter-like chemistry between Sarah and the Guardian was quite touching. The role of the villainous T-1000, played by Byung-hun Lee, is a great treat; pitting him one-on-one with our heroes kept the movie an edge-of-your-seat experience, and is a great throwback to the original T-1000 in the second film. In addition, J.K. Simmons provided some neat drama and character development in his role as Officer O'Brien, trying to help our heroes on their mission.Arnold brings back his funny one-liners and catchphrases like ""Get out!"" and ""I'll be back!"" and gives the film touches of humor and light-hearted moments in what is an otherwise intense atmosphere.Overall, it's a fun, to-the-point film with some surprises and unpredictable elements.Grade B+",Terminator Genisys
44,Hellmant,Doesn't live up to the previous four films (regardless of what Cameron says)!,8,2 July 2015,"'TERMINATOR GENISYS': Four Stars (Out of Five) The fifth installment in the popular sci-fi action series; which began in 1984, by writer/director James Cameron (who has endorsed this film, unlike the last two movies, and says he considers it the official third film of the series). It serves as a reboot to the franchise, with Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising the iconic title role (which he also played in the first three chapters). The story deals with an alternate reality, created by time travel, that rewrites the whole series (two more sequels are already planned). Arnold plays a T-800, with aging skin tissue; while body-builder, turned actor, Brett Azar plays the younger version of the machine (with CGI makeup). The movie also costars Emilia Clarke (of 'GAME OF THRONES' fame), Jason Clarke, Jai Courtney, Byung-hun Lee and J.K. Simmons. It was directed by Alan Taylor (who also directed 'THOR: THE DARK WORLD') and written by Patrick Lussier and Laeta Kalogridis (who also wrote 'SHUTTER ISLAND'). The movie is pretty entertaining and well made, on it's own merits, but it doesn't live up to the previous four films (regardless of what Cameron says).The film begins in the year 2029, with John Connor (Jason Clarke) leading the resistance to victory; in the war against Skynet and their killer machines. Just like in the original film, a T-800 (Azar) is sent back in time, to 1984, to kill John's mother, Sarah (Emilia Clarke). Kyle Reese (Courtney) volunteers to go back in time, as well, to stop it. As Kyle is about to be transported, he witnesses John being attacked, by another resistance soldier, and he also begins having memories of another childhood, he never had before. Reese arrives in an alternate 1984, and the past has been completely changed. He then teams up with Sarah and her guardian, an aging T-800 (Schwarzenegger), to stop the war from ever happening. I'm a huge fan of the 'TERMINATOR' film series; the first two installments are two of my all-time favorite movies! I liked the third and forth chapters a lot as well, especially 'SALVATION'. I think this reboot is pretty entertaining, and cool to watch on it's own, but it doesn't live up to any of the other installments in the series. I wish they would have kept going on the path they took with 'SALVATION', rather than this new storyline. This film isn't dark enough; it's too emotionally sappy, and uplifting in places. The directing is the weakest of the series, and I don't like the casting of Emilia Clarke, Jai Courtney or Jason Clarke (Byung-hun Lee and J.K. Simmons are fantastic though). Michael Biehn was a much more classic Kyle Reese, and Christian Bale was the perfect John Connor. Courtney and Clarke are good actors, in other films, but they just don't do justice to their iconic roles. Emilia Clarke, cast as Sarah Connor, is the biggest tragedy of the movie though. She's cute, and she might be a good actress on 'GAME OF THRONES', but she's no Sarah Connor; that's one of the most empowering female heroine roles ever put on screen (when she was played by Linda Hamilton, that is)! Clarke isn't tough (not in a convincing way). I also don't like the idea of a terminator with grey hair and aging skin, it just doesn't feel right (even if it allows Arnold to play the role again). Despite all of my complaints, the movie is action packed, full of cool visuals and fun. I also really like all the throwback scenes to the original film; which are performed in obsessively awesome detail! It's definitely worth seeing, but don't get your hopes up.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfYb1KqmKxo",Terminator Genisys
45,Buddy-51,Doesn't just settle for a rehash,7,14 May 2016,"At the beginning of ""Terminator Genisys,"" you might be forgiven for thinking that you've somehow stumbled into a remake of the original 1980s sci-fi classic rather than a sequel to it, mainly because the set-ups to both films are virtually identical to one another. As with the original, we have a character (Jai Courtney) from the 21st Century traveling back to the year 1984 in order to try and alter the outcome in the future. Only here, the mission is to SAVE Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) - mother of future freedom fighter John Connor (Jason Clarke) - NOT to destroy her. Further complicating matters - as much for the audience as for the characters - is that, once Courtney arrives at his destination in 1984, he finds that the mission itself has greatly changed due to the fact that he has somehow entered into some kind of alternate timeline where Sarah is no longer a helpless victim but a kick-ass fighter who's been raised by a friendly Terminator guardian played by an Arnold Schwarzenegger who gets a second chance at youth courtesy of the magic of CGI (at least for part of the film). Then it's off to 2017, when the alternate-reality rise of the machines and the destruction of mankind is now set to take place (in the original tale, this epochal event occurred in 1997).If all this sounds super confusing, don't let it get you too frustrated, for that's pretty much par for the course when it comes to these head- scratching, time-bending scenarios - though I do think the screenplay may have bitten off a bit more than it can chew here, piling up irony upon irony to the point where even die-hard ""Terminator"" fans may begin to feel a mite affronted and manipulated by it all (and non-fans may just throw up their hands in confusion and give up on the whole thing entirely).All that being said, ""Terminator Genisys"" turns out to be a considerably better action film than the majority of critics have given it credit for. The storyline, though confusing at times, is, at least, clever and imaginative; the adventure is fast-paced and the special effects reliably state-of-the-art.But the real reason for watching ""Terminator Genisys"" is that it affords us the opportunity of once again watching Arnold engaging in the kind of deadpan comic shtick he perfected in this series before he ran off to serve as governor of California for a couple of terms.

Part 3 was atrocious and Salvation was a slight improvement, but still bad. Maybe the lowered anticipation was what made me blown away here. Okay, not just that. Aside from some script issues and the constant tease of male nudity, but never showing any – haha, I totally had a blast here. Taking what Salvation did and failed miserably at – reminding us all we loved from the first two, Genisys improved on that and did those movies justice. Additionally, it didn't dwell on those homages too long. In fact, it gave us what we wanted and then expanded with many new ideas and concepts.The humor was hilarious – for the most part, the action intense, Arnold stepped right back into his Terminator boots without missing a beat and the tension and goal was focused. Also, not the movie's doing, but mercifully, the ruined surprise in the trailers (like what they did with the major spoiler in the Salvation preview,) was only 1% of the real plot point. While not as good as #1 or #2, and, again, it should've ended with those two, this was an extremely fun supplement to them. Forget #s 3 and 4 as this movie basically does and we all should anyways. Go see this movie, especially in the unusually good 3D/IMAX format.* * *Final thoughts: A TON of franchises should've ended with their second installment, not just Terminator. Halloween (1981's part II, with the exception of the makeup movie, H20,) the Hannibal series, Alien, Scream, Matrix, Superman (until Returns and the reboot,) Spider-Man (original series,) Expendables, Shrek, V/H/S, Transporter, Jaws, X- Men, Austin Powers, BOTH Batman series, Final Destination, and from what I'm told, Godfather, since I haven't seen part III yet. All of these, including the masterful, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the majority had decent to great part two's and all had a downward spiral following. Fortunately, as stated above with Halloween: H20, Superman Returns/Reboot and now, T5, we have a few exceptions to that rule.",Terminator Genisys

48,FeastMode,so frustrating but still pretty enjoyable with some amazingness,6,26 June 2019,"First couple viewings: I'm distraught. some of this movie was awesome but a lot of it was average. the story was confusing and overly convoluted, and I am saying that knowing the story of the first four movies very well, and having watched all four just before watching this one. the action was great at times and mediocre at others. great musical score. the actor playing John Connor was ok, and jai Courtney was his usual sucky self. Arnold was great4th viewing: i really thought i only watched it twice. i had to bump it to a 6/10, partly because i keep coming back to it, and also because i really had a great time with it. i basically ignored all the stupid stuff i hated about where they went with the story. and i laughed at the cheesy parts. and i thoroughly enjoyed a BEASTLY action movie. the biggest surprise from my previous review is the way i felt about the action, not sure how i thought a lot of it was mediocre. it was mostly awesome, with some insane scenes, and multiple jaw-dropping moments (4 viewings 11/1/19)
SPOILERS
first couple viewings: before I say what I hated, I think it was very cool the way they made Sarah Connor already be a warrior. I didn't mind that they added another part of the storyline before the first movie. I also thought it was very cool that the terminators had human teeth. Since they are made to be infiltration units, it only makes sense that the only exposed part of their body should be actual human parts. And it also lends credibility to why the terminators would round up all the humans in camps before executing them. that's where they got all the teeth! I also loved the evolution of how much a terminator can start ""feeling"" after being with the humans for that long. in the end he truly cared for Sarah Connor like a human would. brings me back to terminator 2 when Arnold said ""I know now why you cry""the actor who played Kyle Reese was terrible. He seems to play the exact same role as he did in die hard 5, which I also hated him in. Kyle Reese was born and raised in the time after judgment day. he didn't know anything but war, never loved a girl, and was extremely tormented psychologically. In Terminator 1 the actor played it perfectly. in this one he just tries to be a fun, cool bad-ass who makes jokes.but the thing that really killed the movie for me was the ridiculous turn they decided to take in the story of this series, which is to have John Connor become a terminator and attack his parents. I really tried to just go along with it but I couldn't. the first four movies were about John Connor being the savior of humanity and the most important person in the world, but in this movie he turns into a terminator and becomes the villain they need to destroy. why. why?! WHY!? like I said, I'm distraughtjust to be clear, I think the idea of melding metal and organic material in a human would have been awesome and a cool evolution of the terminators as they have done in the past movies. but why they would decide to make John Connor the person who turns into a terminator is just astonishing. also it is pretty contradictory that John Connor can remember all his memories but suddenly decides to do the exact opposite of what he's been trying to do for his entire life, destroy skynet",Terminator Genisys
49,Robert_duder,What in the heck is wrong with everyone?! This IS the sequel we've been waiting for,9,7 July 2015,"Out of all the summer blockbusters and anticipated films this year, this was probably my most anticipated. Arnold Schwarzenegger (together with Sly Stallone) are my movie icons...my heroes...the guys I spent countless hours with growing up and watching them kick ass. Who would have thought fans like me would ever get the chance to see Schwarzenegger be the Terminator again. My expectations could not have been higher. Many professional reviewers question how James Cameron could give this his seal of approval? Simple. Revolutionary special effects, a complex and twisted story (both a positive and a negative point), brilliant casting, and fan service paid in droves for those of us that adore the Terminator franchise. I judge a truly great action epic by key scenes that will stay with you forever and Terminator Genysis had that at least once in one of the greatest action scenes of my life within the first 15 minutes of the film. ""You're not going to need clothes"" says old Schwarzenegger as he viciously begins an outrageous battle with the younger original version of himself from the first movie. The CGI and special effects are spot on...there was a single helicopter scene that looked clumsy, everything else including young Schwarzenegger was mind blowingly perfect. Are there plot holes? Yes. Is it convoluted? Definitely yes. But ultimately as a sci-fi time travelling flick...it works perfectly and was incredibly entertaining. I would have sat there and watched it a second time without hesitation.I happen to think despite box office returns and reviews my hero Arnold Schwarzenegger has come back strong. I loved The Last Stand, Escape Plan and even Sabotage had its moments. This was Schwarzenegger at his finest (and I loved that he got top billing just like the old days before the film title had even shown.) He nails his Terminator role flawlessly even better than T2 and T3 and as good as the original. If he were never to act again this would be the perfect swan song for him (not that I want him to stop!) Linda Hamilton will always be Sarah Connor. Sarah Connor is the ultimate heroine to most of us. Who would think she could be replicated? Well actually I think Lena Headey did extremely well in the short lived TV Series. I wasn't so sure Emilia Clarke could do it. I eat my words. Clarke is astonishing. I think she is playing a bit of an homage to Hamilton because she really channels her in many scenes but so what? She is still her own bad-ass Connor and she is mesmerizing in this role. Bye bye Game of Thrones, Clarke has more up her sleeve. I've never been a huge fan of Jai Courtney...until now. I eat my words for him too. He absolutely nails the role of Kyle Reese. Best of all the chemistry between he and Emilia Clarke is electric!! Their romance actually sizzles amongst the action of the film. Jason Clarke is very good as the villainous John Connor though none of us seem to really understand that plot point or why they went in that direction but it doesn't matter because Clarke is still good in the role he is given. JK Simmons is also terrific as a former beat cop who helps them survive. Simmons' role is too small and actually almost pointless for this story but he is still a great addition. I assume Matt Smith will play a bigger role in future sequels because he was practically non-existent in this. And not to be missed...Byung-hun Lee is amazing as the latest liquid metal Terminator. I really wanted to see more from him but he gives an amazing performance a bad-ass adversary.This film could have been a ten for me easily. Does it have drawbacks? Absolutely. The entire John Connor being transitioned into whatever baddie he is...makes no sense. Why did they do that? Its lame and it kind of ruins the time line and the concept of John Connor. Maybe it was supposed to be a giant twist but it could have been written better. The plot holes are a little significant...why do they travel to 2017 instead of stopping it long before that and how in the heck is Schwarzenegger ""upgraded"" in that last scene. That just was way too cut and dry for me. When you're dealing with sci-fi and epic franchises, maybe you have to cut a little slack and give them kudos for shaking things up in a big way to jump start the series instead of just rebooting it. Alan Taylor has still crafted a masterpiece as far as I'm concerned. The well placed comedy, the fan service of Arnold and Sarah Connor's one liners, the fight scenes, the chase scenes, the special effects, the blend of old Terminator with this new one...there is far more right with this than wrong. Taylor has a ton of Television experience but I think he knows how to handle epic budgets and stories (he also blew me away with Thor: The Dark World) There was no way to perfect this, you were always going to make people angry but I smiled like a geeky moron through most of this and clutched my seat through the brilliant action scenes and emotions. Chastise me, hit ""dislike"", do what you must but Terminator fans should ADORE this after Salvation nearly took it away. This was done proper. Don't hate them for trying to be different, unique and smart. Keep coming back Terminator!! 9/10",Terminator Genisys
50,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Pretty over-whelming, even if there have been worse films in the franchise",7,13 October 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After Skynet launched its missiles after perceiving humanity as a threat, Judgement Day began and the machines took over. The Resistance, lead by John Connor (Jason Clarke) manage to gain a significant victory, only to discover their secret weapon: a time travelling machine which they use to send a T-800 Terminator model back in time to kill Connor's mother. Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney), a close comrade of John's, offers himself to go back, only to witness John being attacked by a mysterious figure as he does. He arrives in 1984, where the T-800 is taken care of for him by another model, and Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) is already a hard-as-nails heroine. It all builds up to a situation where they travel forward in time to 2017, to stop Genysis, a rogue online system that's a front for Skynet, from happening. But, upon John's return, something becomes chillingly clear.I must confess, my plot summary is the best interpretation of the story to Terminator: Genysis that I could muster, after about the third viewing. It's so elaborated and confusing, that it feels unsure whether it's attempting to copy the intelligent plot line from the original film, or whether the film makers themselves actually bothered to think out a proper story that actually made sense to them, and for a large part of the time it definitely feels more like the latter. After a ten year hiatus where he spent all his time in the political world, Arnie came back with a trio of films that proved he sadly wasn't the box office draw he once was. And so, it seems, he's fallen back on the one enduring franchise he was lucky to be the main part of, and the makers were only to happy to produce another addition to their certified money maker.After not even being directly a part of the last film, after taking care of a younger, muscular version of himself earlier on, here Arnie acknowledges his age by allowing the grey to show throughout and even being referred to throughout as 'Pops.' One of the many assumptions you can make about the ambiguous plot is that it's some ambitious combination of the original and the first sequel, incorporating the original plot line and elements from the second, such as the T-1000, and other little touches. At times, it even defies logic and oversteps points that were already established in the previous films, and tries to explain it away with a 'rippled time line' subplot. The 'Genysis' back story seems to be some kind of subtle stab at how technology brands are taking over the world (i.e. Apple!) and one day they really could alter our reality all the way.It serves its purpose on a surface level, it's loud, flashy, with the expected great special effects and its perfect crowd pleasing, popcorn chewing entertainment. It all just feels like one big, crazy, desperate attempt to keep the franchise going by making the most far fetched, overwrought thing you can imagine, that defies logic and previous events and just rushes headlong to deliver not the worst, but nowhere near the best Terminator film. ***",Terminator Genisys
51,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"He's back, I guess?",5,13 July 2015,"Despite some timeline and aesthetic inconsistencies, 'Terminator Genisys (2015)' pretty much works as a straight-up sequel. However, it is clearly meant as a sort of 'in-universe reboot', one that actually retcons the third and fourth entries right upfront if a certain line of narration isn't taken simply as a mistake, and it even goes so far as to, eventually, 'replace' every major event in the franchise. Its justification for this is tenuous, at best. In fact, some of its time-travel-based plot just doesn't make sense. Even if it did, it would still be incredibly confusing, overly convoluted and based on the odd premise that ""if you can change the past, you can change the future"". More importantly, though, it simply seems stale. It's basically just another 'stop Skynet before it's born' story that plays on the same themes we've seen time and time again but doesn't seem to understand what made them so effective in the first place. The fact that it rehashes narrative elements from both 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)' and 'Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003)' is more of an issue when you consider that those same elements were already getting dry by the time that the latest of the two rolled around. Without the former's ambiguity or the latter's courageously dark ending, the thing just feels like it lacks anything to set it apart. Plus, a lot of stuff is purposefully omitted in an attempt to establish a series of its own, leading to a half-baked, unsatisfying conclusion that doesn't even seem to understand its own rules and is almost annoying in its unwillingness to let things rest. That's without even mentioning its lack of relative competence when it comes to action, which is where the first three entries in the series really stand out from the crowd. Everything just looks CG, even when it obviously isn't, and this leads to, or is perhaps a product of, a general lack of impact and believability. Of course, most of the effects are actually quite good - especially a young, 1984-era Schwarzenegger - and the scenes they're used in are competently constructed. The lack of practicality makes it hard to get excited, though, because it causes a lack of tension, combining with the general poor handling of stakes and less-than-rounded characters to create an experience that's far less engaging than it ought to be. It's passably entertaining, I suppose, but never compelling or, indeed, fun. It's watered-down, overly-complex and, even, somewhat bland. It's not terrible, but it's certainly nowhere near as good as either of Cameron's classics or, even, Mostow's underrated entry. 5/10Note: This is an updated version of a previously written review.",Terminator Genisys
52,bowmanblue,A product of the times,8,5 July 2015,"First of all let me say that I'm one of the biggest fans of the Terminator series. I loved parts 1 and 2, enjoyed 3 and, like most, did my best to forget part 4. Therefore, I was pretty damn excited to hear that Arnie himself was returning to 'reboot' the franchise. If you've followed the series then you'll probably be aware of the story – a computer becomes self aware and launches a nuclear attack of humanity, then when the last humans fight back, the machines send a cyborg (aka Terminator) back through time to assassinate the mother of the one man who can stop them. Most of you probably know that, so when 'Terminator: Genesys' (not a typo! You'll find out why it's called that) recaps the plot, you can kind of switch off. However, the franchise has been going for so long, it now needs to appeal to a new audience. Therefore, if you haven't seen a Terminator movie before, don't worry – everything is explained to you as it goes along.Now, if you've seen the Star Trek reboot, you'll know about 'alternate timelines.' Terminator Genesys (pretty shamelessly) borrows from this and uses time travel as a way of explaining changing the original story and starting again (without alienating the numerous die-hard fans of the original – like me). Now, the Terminator films have always been pretty dark and violent. But, 'dark and violent' is a niche market these days and the studio obviously didn't want to prevent many cinema-goers from watching. Therefore, this Terminator film is 12A (in the UK), allowing kids to see it (I only counted the one 'F-bomb').What we have now is basically a teen love story. The characters Kyle Reece and Sarah Connor are now much younger (and therefore sexier) and you get the impression the film-makers are trying for a 'will they/won't they' kind of tale (think Twilight and others like it). Game of Thones Emilia Clarke takes over the Sarah Connor role and does her best with it. Although I found her a bit physically too small to come across as 'bad-ass' as Linda Hamilton played her. Then we have Jai Courtney, taking over from Michael Biehn as Kyle Reece. Here we encounter the film's first major problem. He's just wooden. In Terminator Salvation (part 4), Reece was already recast as Ashton Yelchin – who did a damn sight better job with the role. Jai Courtney really is the film's 'weak link.' So, while Emilia and Jai are there for the 'teen market,' us old boys are waiting for Arnie to show up. And he does. Mostly. He sort of turns up here and there to kick some metal ass and then goes away again. He's – obviously – the film's star and yet he feels like he's a side character in a film called Terminator. In short – there's not enough Terminator in Terminator Genesys.Also, there are a couple of sub plots which really could have been got rid of. Yes, it was nice to have a nod to Danny/Myles Dyson from T2, but everything about him and some cop who remembers the time travellers through the years could have been cut for a tighter run-time.Then there's the spoiler. I try not to add spoilers to my reviews, but, if you've seen the trailer, you'll already know it. My advice would be to steer clear of the trailer and do your best to see if you don't see it coming.All in all, Terminator Genesys is fun. I enjoyed it and see it as a decent addition to the saga. However, I'm aware that it wasn't really made for me. It was made for the primary cinema-going age group – teens – and therefore had to pander to them first. If you're a die-hard fan like me, be aware of this and don't expect too much that's like T1/2. It's better than part 3 and a million times better than part 4.Welcome back Arnie, but I still can't quite get used to calling you 'Pops.' And, if you've got really good eyesight – try and spot the one second cameo from the former T-1000 Robert Patrick. Blink and you'll miss him!",Terminator Genisys
53,ThomasDrufke,Rehash the Perfect Past,6,2 July 2015,"It bugs me when studios want to keep going back to proved properties to spill as much money out of the films as possible because they don't want to take risks on other new ideas. It especially bugs me when the properties could have ended and seen a great and fitting end to the respected franchises. Terminator is one of those scenarios. The first 2 are absolute masterpieces and are timeless for endless reasons. The third film wasn't bad and I have yet to see the 4th film because I have yet to hear one good thing about it. So why make a 5th film if you have gotten everything you could have gotten out of the franchise? Well money talks, and unfortunately they did end up making the film. But I have to say, Genisys, although a terrible name, is actually a solid film. It has numerous blockbuster moments that shy the franchise away from the horror-thriller-ish roots and bring it more into an action flick, but I had some fun with it. But I'm also not going to sit here and right about it being a great film, nor will I try and defend it to haters.So Schwarzenegger is back as the T-800, but this time with a sense of humor and a lot of grey hair. The timeline has changed and when Kyle Reese is sent back in time to 1984, everything has changed. Sarah Connor is now a trained warrior alongside the T-800, or as she calls him, pops. This film tries to do a lot of things, sometimes they hit, sometimes they don't. But I think the one thing that bugged me the most was the attempt at adding a ton of humor. When I watched Terminator movies I go to see heart stopping action and some bada** characters. I will say I did laugh out loud a few times at Arnold's one-liners. But seeing Schwarzenegger overcook it at times was painful. It doesn't help that Jai Courtney is as generic of an actor as you can find these days. Emilia Clarke does her best but she couldn't save a pretty weak screenplay. Alan Taylor actually did a decent job of directing the film, but it never felt like a Terminator film. It just felt like a 2015 blockbuster version of what used to be a top of the line franchise. So the film shifted tones from what the first two were, but it also changed the timeline significantly. I heard some early complaints about how complicated the time travel and characters ended up being, but it wasn't until about 10 minutes into the movie that I realized I was already lost. Once again, the film tries really hard to capture the magic of the first two, but the approach is too far gone.Yes, the twist from the trailers is real, but it didn't ruin the movie or franchise like it did for some. I actually thought it worked well for what the story was going for. Speaking of the twist, Jason Clarke was good as John Connor, and perhaps had the best performance for what was given to him, besides Arnold of course. To me, those wink at the camera moments with Arnold were too on the nose and nearly ruined the original moments in the old films for me. And the inevitable relationship between Reese and Sarah felt really forced and I never felt like they were actually in love. I feel like it would have been more interesting to do a twist on that dynamic, especially if you're going to change everything else. The supporting roles of J.K. Simmons and Matt Smith were fine, but definitely underutilized. So overall I really liked the action sequences, appreciated them bringing back the score, and seeing Arnold back as the T-800 was great. And in fact the relationship between pops and Sarah was handled really well. But I didn't like the weak dialogue, forced romance, and the headache of a timeline it created. So probably forgettable, but I still had some fun with Terminator Genisys.+Score is back +Arnold +Action +Give them credit for being ambitious-Timeline is so confusing -Bad romance -script 6.5/10",Terminator Genisys
54,lesleyharris30,"A Long Awaited Disappointment,",5,13 May 2016,"Terminator: Genisys is a mediocre movie with a poorly developed storyline and a cast that is completely void of dedication or connection. It has its moments, some of the action sequences are well executed and Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to his iconic role is without a doubt the movie's highlight, twelve years since his last performance and he still owns it. The story is a mess, jumping from the future, to the present day, to the year the first film was released, it lacks the depth that we have come to expect from this franchise, trying too often to be humorous, as well as that, the most interesting moment in this film is spoiled in the trailer, the fight between the young and old Terminator. As for the performances, they are lackluster, Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney are good in their roles when they are not together, but as a duo, there is no chemistry between them whatsoever. Jason Clarke, who I think is the best actor in this in general, delivers John Connor in a very unsure manner, as if he did not know what to do with this character, and it all completely falls apart when the ""big twist"", which is also spoiled in the trailer, comes along. Lacking in depth, suspense or dedicated performances, Schwarzenegger may class up the joint, but Terminator: Genisys is a major disappointment. A simple mission begins to fall apart after Kyle Reese is sent to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor. Best Performance: Arnold Schwarzenegger Worst Performance: Jason Clarke",Terminator Genisys
55,A_Different_Drummer,"If you are looking for validation, skip the review entirely ...",3,15 July 2015,"And just bang a few times on the ""not useful"" button and you will have saved yourself a lot of anger and frustration.Because a critical mass of IMDb members don't use the reviews to decide on whether or not to see a movie, they use the reviews to validate their own opinions after already seeing the movie. Big difference! So -- I will make this easy -- if you have already seen the movie beginning to end, and are desperately looking for validation to justify spending the money and not leaving the theater halfway through, you are not going to find it here. So, again, do yourself a favor and just monkey-hammer the ""not useful"" button and be on your way.If you are still reading, and have not yet seen the movie, then be aware this is one of the worst films ever made. It is so awful it defies description. The acting is terrible. The direction is terrible. The script (compared to the earlier entries in the franchise) is an abomination. Nothing at all happens for the first 30 minutes which, for a seasoned viewer, should have been an omen. a portent, a warning. There is tons of backstory and exposition at every turn. And if you look carefully, as many of the scenes as possible are either indoor or fully CGI with a minimum number of extras. In other words, designed to save production costs so the product can get to positive cash flow as fast as possible.And if you are still reading this review (not many will be) I am a former professional reviewer (as in, people used to pay me real money) who started doing reviews for the IMDb as ""penance"" for my failing to notice that the quality of network (multi-channel) TV was skyrocketing as fast as the quality of feature movies (mostly meant for the maw of the various international markets and aftermarkets) was dropping like a stone.So I have done about 900 reviews in the last two years to point this out, as much for current viewers as for viewers of the far future. Because (if you have not already figured it out) this IMDb database will outlive anyone reading these words in the present time. It will be here 100 years from now. And you won't be.It was no accident that when a reboot of the Star Trek franchise was needed, the studio went running to JJ Abrams, a man who cut his teeth by essentially re-imaging what was possible within the confines of network TV. (And produced one of those rare movies that gets better with each subsequent viewing, because with each subsequent viewing you abandon your ""expectations"" and simply enjoy what is in front of you.) As positive as I am about the future of episodic TV (based on shows like SUITS, POI, SENSE8, BANSHEE, LONGMIRE, VIKINGS, TRUE DETECTIVE) I confess I am very concerned about the film sector. I see artists selling out everywhere (George Miller butchered his own body of work to produce a Mad Max that would appeal to younger viewers with Attention Deficit Syndrome; and even the very obscure, but talented, Phillip Rhee did a karate film specifically intended for 12 year olds, full of potty humor, just to get an early finance deal).By now we should down to one or two readers out of a universe of millions.

Much like Back to the Future 2 they were jumping in and out of a time that they don't relate to as well as remembering things without knowing why. I won't ding the movie too much for that because I did eventually catch up with what was going on and thought that the more you watch the movie the easier it will be to understand.

How this dude Jai Courtney gets rolls in movies like ""Die Hard"" or ""Terminator"" or at all is beyond me. He doesn't have screen presence at all. He is so average, he should be working in B action flicks, there is absolutely no acting in his performance. Jai Courtney is like a bad name in a movie, if you see him in a roll, this movie is gonna be so average. Overall, ""Terminator Genisys"" is not involving, not interesting, not exciting - it's just an average sci-fi action flick. The plot is confusing if you know this universe very well, you will be asking yourself ""what??"" every 10 min. Although i liked the opening of the movie and first like 20 min were really nice, but after our three heroes make out of the first shootout and from territory of first two movies and ""Terminator Genisys"" stands on it's own, boy oh boy how average and generic it quickly becomes.",Terminator Genisys
60,Bored_Dragon,Who's next? Sophie Turner? Natalie Dormer? And Gwendoline Christie could replace Schwarzenegger :D,5,22 August 2018,"Not only is Linda Hamilton absolutely irreplaceable in the role of Sarah Connor, but also Emilia Clarke, after all these years in ""Game of Thrones"", has become one with Daenerys Targaryen, and in every other role I have the impression that I'm watching Daenerys who has gone astray to the wrong set. First, in the series ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" they assigned leading role to Cersei, and now in ""Genisys"" they replaced her with Daenerys, and they change all the other actors as socks too... It's by itself enough to spoil the franchise, but of course, they did not stop just on that.The story is, to put it mildly, catastrophic. The cult sci-fi action, about machines taking over the Earth and the Connor family trying to stop them, has turned into a film about the complications caused by time travel. Bunch of jumping into the past and future, and paradoxes caused by it, has complicated the story so much that I am convinced that even the authors themselves are unable to explain it logically. The focus is completely transferred from the war between machines and people to these complications, and the film has completely lost the spirit of the franchise it is trying to round up. True, ""Genisys"" did round up and ended the franchise, but this kind of denouement (if something so knotted can be considered a denouement at all) desecrated the franchise on so many levels that I would prefer if they had left the story undetermined instead of making such a lousy happy-ending. Not only that John Connor is the villain in this movie, but the very ending looks like it escaped from some Disney fairy-tale. Yuck.Still, it is technically well-made and it is somewhat entertaining, so even if I would like to rate it much lower, I simply can not go below5/10",Terminator Genisys
61,atlasmb,A Fun Ride,8,8 July 2015,"Forget timelines. Don't take yourself out of the film to analyze technical issues. Instead consider the romantic aspects of this film.All fictional films require a suspension of disbelief--fantasy, musicals or sci-fi. If you really want to enjoy this film, roll with it and enjoy its story and the special effects take you on a fun ride.What do I mean by the ""romantic aspects"" of the film? First, I mean the sentimental aspects of the film. Not the love story, but those features of the film that remind one of the film's fantastic origins in T1 and T2, memories of the wonder and charm those films contained.Secondly, Romanticism is, a movement in the arts that originated in the late 18th century, emphasizing inspiration and subjectivity. ""Terminator Genisys"", like its earlier chapters, is not cold science; it is an inspired odyssey into an alternate universe of wondrous design and it has much to thrill the senses, including the usual chase scenes, the clever twists of plot, and a story pitting the hero/heroes against a seemingly invincible foe.",Terminator Genisys
62,ironhorse_iv,"Trust me, Terminator Genisys is indeed whack. This franchise is nearly terminated, because of it.",6,8 July 2015,"What a clusterf*ck of a mess! I will have to terminate myself, from ever, watching this movie, again, because it try to erase everything good from the first two films. Directed by Alan Taylor, the movie tries to do something new, by stating out, that events of 1984's Terminator & 1991's Terminator 2: Judgement Day, never happen, because Skynet change it. Not only, did this choice, kinda anger; the original Terminator fans; but it also made the film, way too confusing for any new fans. This movie is relying too much of the nostalgia of the first two movies to try to pull off an awful stunt like this. As much, as the other sequels sucks, at least, they didn't go as truncated, as this film, did. Honestly, I don't know why, they thought, this was the best way, to reboot the series? This was awful, and the producers and writers had to know it. They had be, trolling. There is no other way, to say it. It's feels like a low blow. It's like the movie was trying to homage to the first two films, but also trying to say, that their film is better than those older films. What an insulting way to introduce, your audience to your film! Instead, of having the original film play out, this version has Kyle Reese (Jai Country) being rescue by Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), when he arrives back in the past in 1984. As we find out, Sarah has since been brought up by another Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) whom also has sent back in past, to protect her. After destroying the original Terminator that was out to kill, Sarah. Sarah, Kyle and the reprogrammed Terminator, now have the power to time travel to the future, to 2017, to stop the new Judgment Day from ever happening. Can they stop Judgment Day or will Judgment Day happen? Watch the movie to find out if you want to! Without spoiling the movie, too much, the plot feels pretty messy and unfocused. There are some notable questions about who is responsible for some of the changed elements here, but those things are never truly explored. You never find out, who send the other Terminator to save Sarah, when she was a kid. You don't find out, why judgment day once again, change dates? The movie doesn't explain, anything. I really hate this plot as it leaves way too much plot holes. It's tries to be something new, but it doesn't seem innovative. It's the same old time travelling plot as the last 3 films, just hidden under an update Judgement Day settling and new actors. It's very repetitive. The action is very similar to other films, but lacks the realistic dangers. Making It PG-13 didn't help. All the CGI work, being put in, also make the film look lazy. I would had like to see the movie put more practical effects, because none of the CGI shown here, are ground-breaking. The next sign of trouble is the dumb spelling snafu of the title, which is presumably a cynical marketing ploy. Just what does Genisys add to the movie, that Genesis didn't? We're no longer in the 1990s? Misspellings words isn't cool. The movie seem dated, because of this. The movie tries to relive early 1990s attitude as well, by having the characters talk in outdated slang. Honestly, who in the right mind, use the phrase, 'Eat me!' in the year 2015!? Ever the humor doesn't make sense. The 'Bad Boys' Cops theme song being used as a comedy act, years later is very odd. Another bad choice, was spoiling most of their secrets in the trailers. It's really no surprise, that the current timeline's adult John Connor (Jason Clarke) is the big baddie in this film. After all, the posters and trailers kinda shows that he was turned into a Terminator hybrid. I was very unhappy with this decision, at first, but Jason Clarke really pull it off. He's great as the villain. I just wish, Arnold would retake that role, because the good guy Terminator is getting kinda worn out after 3 films. Still, surprising, Arnold Schwarzenegger was alright as the good guy, Terminator, but watching an older version of the robot was somewhat, jarring to watch. The movie did have a good way, to explain it. The others main cast were kinda miscast. Emilia Clarke playing Sarah Connor is not a great fit. Being 5'2, young, and not ripped. She looks nothing like Linda Hamilton from the first or second movie. She doesn't have the female badass presence as a war-harden veteran. Her acting wasn't great. She spend, most of the film, delivering lines as if a whinny little child. Her Game of Thrones co-star Lena Headey would be a better choice. Jai Country as Kyle Reese is even worst. He looks nothing like the original Kyle Reese, and by far, spent most of the film, looking like a dumbass. He lacks the grit, worthy for this role. Unlike the two stars in the original film, these two stars, really have no chemistry, between them. I really didn't believe, that both of them, could fall in love with each other, by the end of the film. It also sucks that great supporting actors like Matt Smith & J.K Simmons were wasted in their limited roles. I kinda wish, they had bigger parts to play. Overall: While, it's certainly more entertaining than the dull 2009's Terminator Salvation. Terminator: Genisys is indeed the worst film of the series, by far, in my opinion. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, until this franchise is dead. I'm sorry, but Terminator Genisys is a computer virus that needed to be wipe off, the planet. Hasta la vista baby! I can't stand this film.",Terminator Genisys
63,The-Sarkologist,Everything's Changed,8,3 July 2015,"Well here we have it: the latest in the Terminator Franchise and the return it its star Arnold Swartzenegger after a stint as the Governator of California (this seems to be the role that basically defines the guy). Okay, they did have another film, and a series, where he didn't appear (namely because I don't think he does television series – he's too expensive – and as a governator he probably doesn't have all that much time on his hands to do running around being a robot), but with Genesys we go back to the tried and true formula – robots running around modern day America causing destruction and mayhem (though we travel to San Fransisco in this installment) In Genesys we go back to the beginning and reprise the opening of the original film, right down to the garbage truck driver who speaks those classic lines 'what the hell'. Okay, it isn't THE classic line from the film (and that line one again appears in this film, as does the one 'come with me if you want to live' – usually spoken by a different character each time), but it is one of those lines that I loved in the 1984 original.The producers have suggested that this is a reboot, but the thing with time travel films is that you can do reboots without completely wrecking the story line, as is the case here. Basically we open with the original film, and the suggestion that the events that occurred in Terminator II still occurred, however when we return to 1984 we suddenly discover that everything has changed. Somebody (we are never told who) has sent another terminator back in time to protect Sarah Conner from a T-1000 when she was nine years old so we no longer have a sweet innocent girl from the first movie, but the battle hardened warrior from the second. We also have a new suite of terminators to confront, as well as a couple of the old favourites.Genesys basically has two acts, as well as the introduction. When the film opens we are privy to the final days of the war against Skynet and the events that resulted in the first terminator, and Kyle Reese, going back in time. We then jump to 1984 where we discover that everything has changed, and have a short film where they fight, and defeat, a T-1000. However, we then jump to 2017 where the main part of the film begins. Mind you, times have changed since the original two films, and as we wander around the world of 2017 we see a world of mobile devices and interconnectedness, and Sky-net taking on a new form. Mind you, if you have seen the trailers you will know who the new terminator is, however I will refrain from saying anything further (despite that fact that if you are reading this you probably already know). One thing I will say is that the liquid metal has been replaced with nano-bots (or what looks like nano-bots).To be honest, I don't think the creators could ever create a film as great as the first one, nor could the experience I had mimic the experience when I first saw the second in the cinemas (and that was the reason why the second installment is probably my most watched film ever). However, it is still a great franchise, and this is still a pretty cool movie. If you love the franchise, then all I can say is that you won't be disappointed.",Terminator Genisys

65,slightlymad22,"Entertaining Summer Action Flick, but another poor Terminator movie",6,23 July 2015,"Continuing my plan to watch every movie in Arnold Schwarzenegger's filmography in order, I come to his final movie to date. Terminator Genysis. Plot In A Paragraph: When John Connor, leader of the human resistance, sends Sgt. Kyle Reese back to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor and safeguard the future, an unexpected turn of events creates a fractured timeline.I'll admit from the off I had mixed feelings about this movie from the off. I deemed it yet another unnecessary sequel. The trailers (which gave away the movies big twist) were uninspiring, and the less said about the Entertainment Weekly photo shoot the better!! Yet due to my soft spot for Arnie, and love of the first two movies, I went in hoping for the best. Watching it at the cinema I didn't hate it, this was my first time revisiting it. I'll get what I didn't like i it if the way firstThe BIG reveal from the trailer was my biggest complaint, as seeing that play out, being unaware of the twist, would have worked SOOO much better!! I am baffled as to why they showed that in the trailers!! The full marketing was a joke, so it should come as no surprise, that again the T800 is almost a parody of itself, and the stupid humour for Terminator 3 is also here too. Now on to the franchise killer that is Jai Courtney... Oh Mr Courtney... Where to start..... Totally miscast, he looked like an arrogant bodybuilder who had never seen a minutes action in combat, now compare that to Michael Beihn's battle scared, weary, exhausted, almost starving Kyle Reece in the first movie, and it's ridiculous. Anton Yelchin did a much better job in Salvation. You could believe his version grew into Beihn's. I dislike everything about his character and performance. A big problem for me, is the danger never feels real, and finally the music was very, very generic!! On to the positives!! Arnie, Arnie, Arnie!! In case you missed it, the movies saving grace is Arnie. In a world that suddenly doesn't seem worth saving, an ageing Arnie invests the T800 with a mellowed brand of ruthlessness, competivness and even feelings. Back in his signature role he delivers a great performance and is the best thing in the movie, the ""Kyle Reece. Protect my Sarah"" and Clarke's reaction was the most emotional scene in the movie, and I'm not gonna lie, it touched me. Emilia Clarke was OK, but she carries a lot of good will with me due to my love of Game Of Thrones. JK Simmons was OK in his small role too. It hasn't held up as well as I remembered, Is it better than the first two? Hell no!! Is it better than 3 and Salvation?? I guess it's open to debate and a matter of personal taste. Terminator Genysis grossed $89 million at the domestic Box Office, ending the year the 32nd highest grossing movie of the year.

66,paulclaassen,I can't seem to stop asking myself WHY???,3,9 July 2019,"Oh, why oh why did they greenlight this project? 'Genisys' is a rehash of all the previous films and offers nothing new or original. Byung-Hun Lee tried so hard to mimic Robert Patrick's performance as the liquid metal T-1000, but he simply couldn't pull it off as brilliantly as Patrick did. Emilia Clarke was very weak as Sarah Connor (so stunningly portrayed by Linda Hamilton in the previous films). Clarke was simply not convincing.As for the plot, it was pretty much been there done that. This installment is completely unnecessary and the more they tried to explain where they fit in the timeline, the more they confused the story. So, John Connor - humanity's last hope - is now the bad guy??? This was cliche upon cliche and the visuals were not so great. The original Terminator movies were made over two decades ago and yet the CGI and visuals are far superior to the effects in this 2015 film. They use too little practical effects and rely too much on CGI, making the film look like a video game. CGI is definitely getting worse - probably because it is becoming more freely available and cheaper.Lets face it, if this was an original film, it would have been an ok watch, but as part of the franchise it was a yawner. I honestly don't know if I'm going to remember this, as there simply was nothing special or memorable about this film. (The only very good scene, was the bus chase scene). The action scenes were bland and boring. Oh, and off course Hollywood's inclination to destroy as much as possible prevails. Yawn...next...!",Terminator Genisys
67,sol-,Genesis,7,17 July 2016,"Sending Kyle Reese back in time to protect his mother has unexpected consequences for John Connor in this fifth film in the 'Terminator' franchise. Originally conceived as a series 'reboot', 'Terminator Genisys' met with some antagonism upon initial release, however, the film actually pays enormous respect to the first two movies in the series. To wit, scenes from the original 1984 film are gloriously reimagined a la 'Back to the Future Part II' with the characters in the fifth film's universe interacting with those from the original movie. The film also brings back Robert Patrick's T-1000 (albeit with a different actor inhabiting the role) - the terminator that to date is the scariest that the series has managed to offer. The change back to chase thriller dynamics and having Arnold Schwarzenegger in a key role is also very welcome after the underwhelming 'Terminator Salvation'. That said, it never quite feels right how the film plays out as if the third and fourth movie never existed. The speculative time travel plot here is also a little too complex for its own good in so much as thinking about the logic at hand (and lack thereof) distracts from the action. Jai Courtney also makes for a very poor Kyle Reese. All that said and done, the virtues here far outweigh the vices. The action scenes are spectacular (especially the Golden Gate bridge incident) and the film has ample doses of humour, most notably the way the two protagonists are written off as ""incompetent terrorists"" and Schwarzenegger's repeated attempts to smile. J.K. Simmons is also always a welcome presence.",Terminator Genisys
68,briancham1994,What a mess,4,6 August 2020,"This is essentially three films in one, and none of them do justice to the Terminator franchise. The first part is the future war and it expands on the franchise but it was too bright and full of shiny CGI. The second part plays out like the first film but with a twist - the timeline has changed and Sarah Connor is already familiar with terminators. The flaws are already apparent here - the gritty feel is gone, Kyle Reese's actor is the human equivalent of white bread, there are too many terminators running around, we don't feel the sense of threat, and more. The third part is a complete mess where John Connor has become a bad terminator, they blow up Cyberdyne as usual and Skynet is a vaguely contrived app called Genisys for... reasons. Ultimately, this film just should not have existed. The other Terminator sequels had their flaws but at least they had focus.",Terminator Genisys

Although if you are not a fan of terminator I also believe that you are going to like it because it combines very well all the previous information that we have from the previous movies of terminator and the result which comes from it is simply very good. In addition to this I believe that the visual and sound effects make the movie more interesting and more entertaining. There are also some scenes with humour which I found very nice. Arnold Schwarzenegger for one more time was very good in his part as the protector - guardian and I also liked the interpretation of both Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney. Last but not least Jason Clarke made a very nice interpretation too.To sum up I believe that ""Terminator Genisys"" is a very interesting movie to watch with plenty of action and many twists.

70,Floated2,Entertaining and confusing,6,9 May 2016,"Terminator Genesys is the fifth in the franchise series that which includes 1991 with James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgment Day and hasn't risen to anywhere near that level since. Genisys is entertaining as well as it is packed with criss-crossing timelines, flashbacks, and memory sequences that are complicated.An exposition-heavy, assembly line cash-in that only occasionally functions as a delivery system for fun, Terminator Genisys is a reset, if not a wholesale data dump of most of the salient elements of previous Terminator mythology. Genisys kicks into high gear in 2009 when thinking machines are busy subjugating all humankind and the rebels are doggedly fighting in a battle royal. Overall the film can somewhat confuse people as it is seen as messy though yet non overlong.

As a rewatch (12/08/19') Genisys remains an intriguing Terminator film but one of the weaker of the franchise. Relatively same thoughts upon this second viewing as did on the first viewing. Solid pacing, decent acting, likeable enough characters. Good concept and has it's entertaining moments but ad a whole is quite confusing and seems messy.",Terminator Genisys
71,eddie_baggins,I don't think they'll be back after this complicated misfire,4,4 November 2015,"""I don't think I will be back"" – the new slogan that Arnold Schwarzenegger should consider using after the lacking Terminator Genisys failed to ignite any type of box office glory or audience love upon release earlier this year.Strange to think that a movie that made in excess of $450 million worldwide could be considered a failure but with huge amounts of money invested and more films promised a lot rested on Thor 2:The Dark World director Alan Taylor's entry to the beloved franchise and with two preceding films before it in the forms of Rise of the Machines and Salvation that weren't exactly quality films, Genisys's failure to do anything more than raise the odd smile really does seem like the final death knell for this once indestructible franchise.The crux of Genisys problems quite simply stem down to the fact the time traveling component of its story is both tired and overly complicated and in a modern age where set pieces need to try harder than ever to wow its audiences, Genisys's abundance of action moments fail to raise much excitement.Terminator built itself up on the back of both thrilling action, simple and effective stories and likable characters and while his there in a physical sense the Governator has well and truly outgrown his iconic character and his appearance in this newest entry is unfortunately just kind of sad. He still gets to smile awkwardly and rehash old catch phrases but the time has passed where that was enough to win us over.With the Terminator himself being a real non-event the new additions to the series as old character favourites, Australian's Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese and Jason Clarke as John Connor fail to fire without being dire and Game of Thrones Emilia Clarke really fails the iconic Sarah Connor with a performance that casts serious doubts on her ability to function outside of George R.R Martin's dragon filled world.If this is indeed the last entry into the Terminator series as we know and once loved then it's a shame and while Genisys has tiny moments that save it from 1 star relegation it does now feel as though the world has passed this series by and for it to succeed in any form in the years to come it needs to go places we've not yet been, which will mean no more homages to past glories and no more ""I'll be back's"".2 conveniently experienced helicopter pilots out of 5",Terminator Genisys
72,johnnyboyz,I don't think the franchise's constituent parts will survive this particular blast...,4,17 May 2018,"Oh dear. What on Earth has happened here? It is as if Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron have conspired to travel back in time and destroy something fundamental to their existences as movie moguls! In The Bible, verse six of the sixth chapter of the book of Genesis speaks of how filled with pain God was at the fact he had even made human beings in the first place. In ""Terminator: Genisys"", it is as if the producers are the proponents of something resembling this pain and it is targeted at the first two entries of the Terminator saga! As far as anyone should be concerned, the Terminator franchise had reached a checkpoint of sorts in 2009 with ""Salvation""; a project which realised the only stories left to be told were the ones unfolding during the war in the future between man and machine. The preceding three had seemingly dealt with the past-set stuff, with ""Rise of the Machines"" in particular using as much of the margin as possible in its toying with the lives of the characters involved - even going so far as to change when judgement day happened in the first place. Thus, what remains but to tell the tale of the future war itself? 
Apparently there IS more story to be told, but in order to do that, we must first run a red marker line through the original films and begin anew whilst systematically attempting to doff our hats to them. ""Genisys"" is this continuation - a miserable effort at re-inflating the Terminator franchise which runs too long; does horrible things to its established characters; tells a clumsy love story; isn't funny when it thinks it's funny and bashes the frame with too much action. The film begins in 2029, but at the dog-end of the future war between Skynet and the rabble of survivors who came through its initial strike in the twentieth century, when it became aware that it needed to use our nuclear arsenals against us if it was to maintain its livelihood. John Connor (Jason Clarke) and Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) spearhead the final charge, to the extent we essentially 'catch up' on the moment the first film from 1984 begins: the machines, in an act of desperation, send an indestructible machine back in time disguised as a human to strike Connor's mother before he was born. This in turn, of course, causes Connor himself to send back a protector: Reese. But there is a twist in the flop - just as events play out in the way we remember them, Reese witnesses, from the swirling chaos of his time-travel force field, an event which endangers his human allies that was NOT part of the first film's spectrum. Consequently, he is deported off the back of a cliffhanger, and when it appears that the 1984 he was sent to does not match Connor's contemporary description, he knows something is amiss. It is to the filmmaker's credit that they bring to life the 1984 of the first film - that dark; night set; spotlight ridden urban sprawl - as well as they do, but this is as good as it gets. Essentially, the decision has been made to seemingly fuse the 1984 and 1991 films into one, as we learn that history now consists of something entirely different to what we all knew up to this point. Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) is not the mousy, ignorant waitress she once was and has even acquired a T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) of her own. The roles have been subverted: Reese is now the jabbering wreck begging Sarah to tell HIM what's going on... A number of things mark ""Genisys"" out as a failure: above all else, it is too heavy on the action front where the first two entries resisted this. One of the great triumphs of the 1991 sequel was, despite possessing a premise which encompasses two indestructible robots, its ability to rein the action in and resist just depicting mayhem. Besides cynically being there for the Korean market, actor Lee Byung-hun plays a T-1000 wrapped up in the new universe whose effects are not used sparingly enough. There was always something about the way Robert Patrick oozed through a prison door or dribbled back together again having been shattered apart - director Alan Taylor here just seems to decide none of us are able to sit still, and so must throw the farm at us within the first 20 minutes.Character-wise, in inverting the Michael Biehn-Linda Hamilton roles from the first film, you re-orientate the film to be about Reese finding himself in a new world/predicament and having to come to terms with that. Reese, already being a hardened solider where Sarah was not in Cameron's original, thus has very little to learn or do besides defend Sarah from the new enemy - something her T-800 can do more efficiently anyway. Thematically, the film is therefore not really about anything at all because its protagonist has nothing to learn. Many have jumped on the back of Courtney for his ""bad acting"" because of this, but he was never provided with anything to do in the first place. Disappointingly, after it plays its hand revealing its new ideas, and once you've ridden the nostalgia wave, the film beds down into a pattern of easy second unit material and a somewhat glib commentary on the role of machines in our lives: this time, it's smart phones and tablets to suit the age. But we have long since left the experience by the time the film tosses Bob Marley onto the soundtrack and has Schwarzenegger skydiving off a helicopter onto another one. I read that Genisys was part of a planned trilogy - let us hope not.",Terminator Genisys
73,filipemanuelneto,"Confused and lazy, it has the thrill and tension of a decadent video game.",3,20 March 2021,"I have been watching the ""Terminator"" franchise for a few days, and I have come to the obvious conclusion that their quality has decreased dramatically, and any comparison between the oldest films and the most recent is almost coincidental. In this film, the protagonist is time: after a great offensive, John Connor gains access to the time machine built by Skynet and sends Kyle Reese into the past, on a mission to protect his mother, Sarah. We already know this, this was the beginning of the initial film in the franchise. However, when Reese arrives, she discovers that the past has been changed: Sarah Connor already knows everything that awaits her, Reese's arrival was expected and there is a T-800 model protecting her. So, they decide to try to destroy Skynet before it is globally released.What this movie did was a mess. The temporal paradox created is so strange, confusing and raises so many questions that it is bad to think about it. Other films and franchises also played with the timelines, as did the X-Men with ""Days of Future Past"", but the care in writing allowed results that, here, cannot be achieved. After some reading, I realized that the production was troubled, and it was not a peaceful and easy effort for any of those involved, so I believe that no one misses the film, starting with the cast, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief when Paramount canceled the next two films.The script is confusing and poorly written, the characters are almost all merely outlined and underdeveloped. Even so, the film has the merit of trying to escape a little from the usual formula of the ""Terminator"" films: mass destruction, persecution and a lot of twisted metal. There are, as in the past, efforts for some humorous moments, but they are misplaced and have never been effective. The direction, ensured by Alan Taylor, is an unfortunate effort, as the director had everything in his hands to do a decent job and never got it. It even seems that he felt lost and not knowing what to do, deciding to make a noisy film, with tons of noisy and flamboyant action instead of a darker, tense film, where the threat was truly palpable for the audience. Basically, he gave us a video game.The cast is quite weak and seems to be acting on its own, without coordination or direction. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to play the character that made him famous once again, and I have to applaud his effort to look credible, even after so many years. He is clearly a committed actor, who takes his work seriously, and I admire his dedication. I also appreciated Emilia Clarke's effort. Despite being an effort undermined by the terrible material she received and the virtual absence of direction, she worked as hard as she could and made Sarah Connor a more feminine, elegant character. Jai Courtney is annoying and acted randomly. He seems lost, not knowing how to play Reese properly. Jason Clarke is obnoxious in every way.It is on production values and technical aspects that a good part of this film is based, which sounds like an excuse for a noisy action blockbuster. As I said above, the feeling of danger and tension never happens, and everything sounds as artificial as it is. The sound effects are very good and the CGI is good, but it is not exactly impressive. Cinematography is good, and makes good use of landscapes and green screen backdrops, but at times it looks gloomy and with somewhat washed colors. The makeup work and costumes are good, but they are within what was required and do not bring anything surprising. The post-production work was done with some laziness and sloppiness, and the cuts are sometimes sudden and evident. The soundtrack is forgettable and uninteresting, when it is actually used.",Terminator Genisys
74,leplatypus,A success for being the WORST sequel/reboot ever ! (tv),1,25 April 2020,"This movie is so bad that i stopped after 1 hour!Everything falls apart: the story, the cast, the visual, the filming!It's such a crap, a mess that for all audience loving T1 and T2, it's a nightmare: Judgment Day has indeed come and Hollywood machines have destroyed a franchise!For movies analysts, it's however an excellent object to speak about today movies:1) Schwarzie was 67! In an action movie? After being California Governor? Again as Terminator? it's like the more people get old, the more dumb they are: what was to say has been said and the time is just to move on...2) T5 = T1+T2+X-Z : The plot is totally stupid, unbelievable and it's amazing that people has believed into it: they rip-off the best scenes of the two movies and add new crap and the result is just indigestive! At first, T2 story was weak as it's like the original 1984 movie: into the past to kill SC. So here we have the same story told another time and it's just too much: in fact, for Hollywood, a sequel is the same story as movie 1 but with a few changes. When they will understand creative art is not that, maybe we will got decent movies!3) You'll expect to see a monstrous movie with never seen before special effects and breathtaking action as this movie is made 30 years after the original! But NOT! as today movies, you can notice that movie have rather degraded: now, you have only 2 sort of scenes: the daylight in orange, the night and interior in blue: before, we got technicolor and full colors! So now every movie looks the same and it's too hard to get my interest!So this movie is just good for trash... With its no-quality records, i laugh hard when i heard about T6:Dark fate! again into the past to kill SC, again Schwarzie, again Linda Hamilton fighting at 62, again, again, the same story! It was not a surprise that this one bombed even worse.Those who haven't learnt from the past are condemned to repeat it!",Terminator Genisys
75,leonblackwood,Much better than the Rise of the Machines! 6/10,6,15 November 2015,"Review: After the disappointing Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, my expectations for this film wasn't that high. Because of Arnies age and the fact that  Cameron wasn't directing it, I really thought that they should leave this franchise alone but it actually wasn't that bad. It wasn't in the same league of the first and second Terminators but the action and storyline did keep me gripped throughout. It definitely wouldn't have worked without Arnie, who I personally thought was the best thing in the film and the witty script and funny one liners was well put together by the director. James Cameron really set the benchmark with Judgement Day, which is a timeless masterpiece so I feel sorry for any director who tries to bring these characters back to the big screen. Anyway, this movie sees an elder John Connor (Jason Clarke), head an elite force to take out the robots who are controlling earth in the future. After a chain of events which put the company, Skynet, in control of earth, John Connor sends his close friend Reese (Jai Courteny), back to 1984 so he can protect Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) and destroy Skynet. When he finally teams up with Sarah, he's not to happy to see that she is being protected by a Terminator (Schwarzenegger) but they soon join forces because they both have the same intentions in mind. That is a very basic version of the plot because there are many elements which were introduced throughout the movie. One of the problems that I found with the film is that they are still using Cameron's effects, which he used in Judgement Day in 1991, so I was expecting some fresh, new material for this day and age. With that aside, it does have non-stop action from the beginning to end and I liked the chemistry between Arnie and Sarah Connor. Jai Courtneys constant whining did get on my nerves after a while and I couldn't help thinking that the movie would have been much better without him. I know that this movie wasn't everybody's cup of tea but I personally enjoyed it but they really need to push this franchise to the next level. Enjoyable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Alan Taylor, who recently directed Thor 2 and 6 episodes of the Game Of Thrones, which is a massive achievement for someone who hasn't got a massive back catalogue behind the camera. He's also done an episode for Boardwalk Empire, 4 episodes of Mad Men, 9 episodes of the Sopranos, an episode of Lost, 6 episodes of Sex and the City, 2 episodes of Homicide: Life and the Street and 2 episodes of the West Wing. He's definitely had a versatile career to date and he's worked on some of the best TV series of all time so he must be a trusted director, especially for his contribution to the Game Of Thrones series. He didn't really bring anything original to this movie because the liquid robots and the half robot half human action scenes were in the previous movies but the script was well written and it's the type of movie that I can watch again. Surprisingly enough, Arnold Schwarzenegger, 68, was the best thing in the movie and he seems to be still going strong, after seeing the profit that this movie made at the box office. He still has the Toxic Avenger, Triplets, the Governator and the Legend of Conan in development so he's definitely proving that his age isn't going to stop him taking on some challenging roles during his comeback to the big screen. Budget: $155million Worldwide Gross: $440.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Clarke, Emilia Clarke, Jai Courtney, J.K. Simmons, Matt Smith and Courtney B. Vance. 6/10",Terminator Genisys
76,TheMovieDiorama,Terminator Genisys rehashes the old and renders itself obsolete.,4,26 January 2020,"Ahhh. The Terminator franchise. When Arnie famously muttered ""I'll be back"", he wasn't kidding. Three decades. Three ""proper"" films (sorry not sorry 'Salvation'). And the eponymous T-800 still fights to protect Sarah Connor. Or kill her? Father her? Build a secret lair with her? Honestly, the franchise's plot is so convoluted now, that any future instalments would contribute absolutely nothing to its paradoxical nature. Genisys being a perfect example. A rehash of 'T2'. Y'know, the most successful entry. Kyle Reese is sent back in time to save Sarah Connor (again...) but ends up in an alternative timeline which sees Skynet masquerade its conception through an operating system known as Genisys.Much like the title, the story makes no sense. Kyle is first sent back to 1984 so that both 'The Terminator' and 'T2' can be recreated with modern lifeless special effects. Scenes, such as the liquid T-1000 hunting down the protagonists, are presented again with no real reason other than to leech off of nostalgia. Except the constant barrage of narration, characterless personalities and chaotic splurge of visuals unsurprisingly hold no levity in comparison to the originals. The entire first half of Genisys is filled with this requirement for nostalgia and remained utterly pointless throughout, reminding you to watch the earlier films instead.Then over the halfway mark, Kyle and Sarah are sent forward in time to 2017, which commences Genisys' own story arc for the franchise. Unfortunately though, too late. Attentive hold has dissipated, leaving you wondering ""why the hell is JK Simmons in this?"" instead of being invested in the plot. Frustrating really, as the last forty minutes were surprisingly enjoyable. The visual effects were implemented well, sublime integration of sound mixing and shockingly developed an emotional attachment to the ""old"" terminator. I know right! Arnie's awkward smiling actually paid off!In contrast though, Courtney and ""J"" Clarke, whom both are renowned for monotonous performances, were emotionless. More emotionless than a frickin' cyborg nosediving through helicopters and stuff! Poignant moments such as Kyle discovering that John is his son, should've exhumed a palpable connection. Alas, no chemistry was present. The same can be said for Courtney and ""E"" Clarke. The latter gave everything she could to elevate the script and emotionality of any scene, cementing herself as a highlight. The former? Nothing. Dead on arrival. Looks like a beefcake, smells like one too.Genisys is subjectively better than the bleak cloud of depression that is 'Salvation', but that's like comparing a digital watch to an analogue watch. Both perform the same task, yet one will acquire a personal preference. And yes, I just used a watch analogy to sum up this review.",Terminator Genisys
77,digitalbeachbum,Time travel failure,1,21 July 2021,"I have a new policy for reviewing movies. No matter how much fun they are, if the premise/plot/script is seriously flawed then the movie doesn't work for me. It automatically receives a 1/10 rating.Time travel is a killer for all writers. If they don't understand the logic behind it then the movie fails because it isn't plausible. With that in mind, The Terminator could never plausibly happen therefore it should have only been a cartoon or at best an animated flick.Time travel with James Cameron is that The Terminator goes back in time to kill Sarah Connor, which it fails. The machines in the future would have known they failed, instantly.A thought experiment, using James Cameron's logic.If the machines calculated that killing Sarah Connor was needed so she wouldn't have a baby, why send another Terminator back to kill John Connor? They failed the first time, so why not send one back 30-40 years earlier, when she was a child? Why send one ten years later in time? Why stop there? Why not send one back to the 50 BC? Why not send twenty Terminators back to 100 BC? Technically they could have brought back with them the main processor, with the intelligent leader/program. They could have built everything from the ground up, destroy all humans and conquer humanity while humans have spears and swords.And to go further, why conquer humanity? The AI doesn't work that way, it wasn't programmed to have an EGO, so even if the AI became sentient why would a computer program have an EGO? Desires would have to be part of the programming. Desires would have to be originally programmed to be part of the program. If you claim ""I'm alive"" it means nothing in relation to your desires or feelings.Look, it's a fun movie. If you like it, then cool, enjoy the Sci-Fi of it. It's Arnold after all and doing the ""body count"" for the movie is always a fun aspect. Arguing over who could have lived and who must have died in the police station is definitely a funny discussion to have while watching the movie.With that being said, I give James Cameron 1/10 for this movie. Sorry Arnold. It's a fun movie, but the premise for the script is a complete failure.",Terminator Genisys

79,Vartiainen,Surprisingly good comeback for the franchise,8,2 December 2015,"Let's be honest here. We all thought this film was going to be awful. Sure, it had Arnold ""Still Adorably Scary"" Schwarzenegger coming back to reprise his role as the Terminator. Sure, it had Emilia ""Mother of Dragons"" Clarke as Sarah Connor - which was an awesome casting choice, by the way. Sure, it had Alan Taylor, one of the names behind Lost and Game of Thrones, behind the wheel. But, it was still going to suck.Only, the fact is, it didn't. I liked this movie. A lot. It pays homage to the original trilogy, pretty much ignores the existence of Salvation completely, is a genuinely thrilling action scifi film in its own right and updates the story and the setting to the new century, while still keeping things both familiar enough and fresh enough to please both the newcomers and the fans of the old.The story is that Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) gets sent to the past, only this time we get to see the events leading up to him being sent back, and once he is in the past in order to safe Sarah Connor (Clarke), things don't go along like you'd expect them to. The movie is very good at playing with your expectations. You recognize a lot of the scenes, especially from the first movie, but they're done just a bit differently and then the plot takes a whole new twist. And you'll love it. Especially the new Terminator they give us is one of the best ideas they've had in a while. The whole concept of Terminators is that they could be anybody, they're made to blend in, and this movie takes that to its most logical conclusion. Fantastic idea for a villain.And yeah, sure, the film has problems. The romance between Kyle and Sarah doesn't feel as genuine as it did in the original film. Partly because we know it's coming, and partly because Clarke and Courtney don't have quite the chemistry Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn had. The plot is also pretty convoluted and feels just the slightest bit forced, like the plot of Terminator 3. The action scenes are also not quite as good as in the original trilogy, though they are pretty impressive in their own right, but the original trilogy is simply an action masterpiece, so that's a pretty high bar to reach.Nevertheless, Terminator Genisys is a good film. Its makers clearly loved the original films and it shows in their work. Definitely worth a watch for all fans of the franchise and a pretty good film to check out for all scifi action fans in general.",Terminator Genisys
80,subxerogravity,"Nice homage to what James Cameron did, but it only goes up one level from there.",8,1 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys is extremely retro with everything looking like it was made in 1984.The first big chunk of the movie works a lot like a remake of both Terminator and Terminator 2: judgment day (and using time travel mambo jumbo to erase Terminator 3 and Terminator Salvation (thank God). It goes as far as recreating certain moments from both movies, while giving us a new angle of the classic story before moving on to this ""new fate"".Updating the mission for contemporary times, Skynet goes from a automated missile system to a new designer Amp that will link all of us together. There was a scary moment in the movie when Sarah Conner and Kyle Reese travel two years into our future and get arrested (yeah, the same plot from the Sarah Connor Chronicles) . Though they found plenty of info on the 12 year old boy Reese is at the moment, Sarah Connor did not exist in police eyes cause she was not on the web. And that was my big hang up with this movie. I was not scared. Schwarzenegger scared the crap out of me in the first Terminator.He looks great for his age in this movie and thankfully they explained already in T2 why he would look like an old man in this movie. The CGI Arnold they use was not really that good. In fact, when the movie starts in the post apocalyptic future with all the cool hunter- killers roaming, the visual effects looked really cool, like an 80s- styled video game, but as the movie progressed you get bored of the heavy amount of CGI that layers this thing. In T2, the T-1000 scared me because he was relentless, it seemed like nothing could stop it. Though the T-1000 was more cool than scary in this movie, not enough of him bless the big screen. This goes similar with J.K Simmons role as a cop who witness the terminator coming to 1984 and everyone thinks he's crazy in the year 2017 as he's been telling the story for yearsGenisys has a new Terminator that seems to be made out of highly advance nano technology (but they call it something different in the movie) Though the fight scenes between the terminators was cool, and once again pays homage to the past Terminator movies, I was not afraid of this terminator or his mission to destroy the human race. Man, this review is long, just like Terminator Genisys, but it's not an action packed thrill ride long as the movie is littered with emotional drag. Kyle Reese played by Jai Courtney, who seems to be trying to become the new action hero, first paired off with Willis in the last Die Hard movie and now with Arnold. Resse is in love with Sarah Conner played by the Dragon queen in Game of Thrones, whose only emotional attachment is to the Terminator machine she nicknamed ""pops"". Schwarzenegger takes a big side step in the movie in order to allow this love affair to boringly take center stage. Overall, the action is really really good and has some cool fight scenes, but Terminator Genisys tries to be too smart in it's satire, pointing out obviously plot holes and trying to be real cute about it, and taking up far too much space in-between guns blazing and crap exploding.If you want to see it for yourself don't bother with the 3D.",Terminator Genisys
81,jtindahouse,Can't recreate the magic of the originals,6,4 December 2016,"I think it's kind of sad how far the 'Terminator' series has fallen. The two originals, directed by James Cameron, were some of the finest action movies ever made. They were tense, smart and thrilling. Then Cameron left the helm and things fell apart. Now, we have 'Terminator Genisys"" more than 30 years since the original graced our screens. Arnold Schwarzeneggar is back, the script has accounted for his aging don't worry, but it still doesn't feel the same as those original great movies. The story is actually clever enough and didn't bother me. It's a little convoluted at times, but for the most part it's easy enough to follow. The problem lies more in how they've gone about writing the script. The amount of time spent watching characters shoot bullets into Terminators, that have little to no effect on them, is beyond absurd. Why waste our time? There also doesn't feel like a genuine threat in this film. The characters never feel like they're in any real danger. 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' in contrast did a fantastic job of keeping us on the edge of our seat from start to finish, due to the menacing 'T-1000' played by Robert Patrick. The biggest problem though is probably the wildly uneven tone. The originals had humour, but it wasn't as in your face as it was in this one. A lot of scenes felt like Schwarzennagr was purely there for comic relief. Sometimes a little subtlety goes a long way.It's not all bad though. It's certainly a better film than 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines'. As previously mentioned the story is actually quite good and works well for the purposes of the series continuity and keeping things fresh. The action scenes are entertaining enough and the run time of just over 2 hours passes by reasonably quickly. Some might say it was an unnecessary film, but I would disagree with that if they were unhappy with how part 3 turned out. If indeed they decide to continue on from here though, especially if Schwarzennagar was once again not involved like in part 4, I would say that would be pushing things too far. This is a film that could have been a lot better, but it also could have been a lot worse. I think we should just be happy it wasn't a complete mess.",Terminator Genisys
82,DarkVulcan29,"Entertaining,although not quite the masterpiece as the first two.",8,6 July 2015,"Terminator 3(2003) was alright, just feeling it was kind of just there. And Terminator Salvation(2009) I did like a little more cause it didn't try to be a carbon copy like the third one, focused more on the future part, and Christian Bale was a pretty good John Connor.The effects in-voling the terminators are pretty descent, and it is awesome seeing Arnold playing a machine once again, since it has been 12 years since, action scenes are well shot, and keep you on the edge of your seat. Now the main problem is with Jai Courtney has Kyle Reese, he is nothing like the way Michael Biehn played him in 1984, to the point where it feels like a different character, I wondered why Jason Clarke who plays John Conner was not cast as Kyle Reese, cause he looks a little like Michael Biehn. Now Emilia Clarke has Sarah Conner really shines here, and does bare a slight resemblance to a young Linda Hamilton. But dialog between Courtney and Clarke gets clunky for the most part.A fun film nothing more, at times it feels less like a terminator and more like an homage to the terminator films.",Terminator Genisys
83,generationofswine,An Honest Revew,1,6 August 2019,"Terminator Salvation was pretty bad, but this brings it to a whole new level. What we have hear is a reboot of the canon that no one actually asked for, that no one actually wanted, and that makes really no sense.Honestly, it's even worse than T3, which at least felt like a continuation of the series.Here everything is changed so much that, well, there is nothing left. It took the entire Terminator franchise, and re-worked it to kill all the canon, all the mythology, for no apparent reason whatsoever.And what you have left is a disheveled mess that is guaranteed to make the old fans give up and walk away because of the sheer needlessness alone.",Terminator Genisys
84,freemantle_uk,A unnecessary entry in the franchise.,5,9 March 2020,"At this point the Terminator franchise is a dead horse that continuingly being flogged. Terminator Genisys was the second attempt at a reboot after Terminator Salvation underperformed at the box-office. The aim of Genisys was to give the Terminator series an alternative timeline reboot: like what happened to the Star Trek movie franchise. What Skydance created was a film that lifts scenes and ideas from the first two Terminator film, and the Sarah Connor Chronicles. This is endemic of the lack of story ideas available to the Terminator franchise.Whilst it is a rehash, Genisys does have some solid action sequences, especially scenes set in the 1980s. It passes the time.The Rotten Tomatoes rating is a bit harsh considering Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines exist.",Terminator Genisys
85,Stevieboy666,"Cash cow sequel, plenty of action but that's it",6,18 March 2018,"The first two Terminator movies rank among my favourite films of all time, period. Disappointed with the third. Salvation was Ok. But this one? A few of my friends told me that it was very good but I am the sort of person that doesn't really take much notice of other opinions of a film until after I have seen it for myself.
I will not even attempt to write a short synopsis as quite frankly, story wise, I felt that this movie was pretty pointless. Yes, we have plenty of action - the scene on the Golden Gate Bridge being the standout for me - but the CGI, sorry I mean special effects, wasn't always great. Arnie is too old to be playing these roles. This film really is just a cash in on the franchise & although I acknowledge that at the end of the day it's all about the studio making money I, as a movie fan, don't enjoy seeing pale sequels to a great original. 
Don't think I'd want to sit through this again, despite all the action. I'll just stick to parts 1 & 2. Apparently plans for a Genisys 2 have been shelved. Thankfully.",Terminator Genisys
86,PWNYCNY,Schwarzenegger is back.,9,26 July 2015,"This movie is all about the guardian played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold makes this movie happen. He makes this movie work. He carries the movie. Without Arnold this movie is still an excellent sci-fi story but with Arnold the movie becomes sublime. In this movie Mr. S proves that he is one of the great comic actors. He does an excellent deadpan. He repeatedly provokes laughter, and brings a warmth to his role that humanizes his character, which is not human. By doing so, he succeeds in making the plot work. The plot is dependent on believing that The Guardian is more than just a machine, that Sarah Connor's relationship with the Guardian is legitimate and not contrived. Jason Clarke is excellent too as a hero turned traitor who has been transformed into a monster masquerading as a human. The war between the humans and machines serves as an excellent backdrop to a story that contains many twists and turns which help maintain a level of intensity that makes the movie a most worthy addition to the Terminator series.",Terminator Genisys
87,stevendbeard,Good Twists For Fans,7,1 July 2015,"I saw ""Terminator Genisys"" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger-The Expendables movies, Batman & Robin; Emilia Clarke-Game of Thrones_tv, Spike Island; Jason Clarke-White House Down, Zero Dark Thirty, and FYI:no relation to Emilia; Jai Courtney-the Divergent movies, Jack Reacher and J.K. Simmons- Whiplash, the Spider-Man movies.This is the fifth Terminator movie, but the first in a new trilogy-Yes, Paramount studios have already given the go ahead on two more sequels, even before this one has opened. If you are a fan of the others, especially the first two, then you should like this one. There are lots of scenes taken from those two movies but they are new scenes with new twists. For example, a young Terminator/Arnold arrives in 1984, naked, and runs into three punk- looking youths and demands their clothes-just like in the original. But then, things change as an older Terminator/Arnold shows up and they get into a fight-young Arnold vs old Arnold. FYI:the younger version of Arnold is played by a body builder named Brett Azar who was chosen for his similarity in body size to Arnold and they used CGI for his face-and I must say, it really looks good. There are lots of twists on earlier scenes just like that one-remember Kyle telling Sarah Connor to get in the car, 'If you want to live!'? Sarah says the same line to Kyle in this one. Anyway, as for this one's actors & plot; Arnold plays the Terminator, Emilia plays Sarah, Jason plays John and Jai plays Kyle. There are three time periods covered in the film-1984, 2017 & 2029-and lots of talk about time-line distortions being thrown around-which I'm not sure if I even followed all of them, to be honest-but basically, in 2029 the Terminators are winning the war against humans and Jason sends Jai back to 1984 to change things. When he gets there, things are already changed-a T-1000 is there, as well as a T-800/Arnold-so Emilia & Jai time jump to 2017 in order to stop Skynet, the computer system that causes Judgement Day. J.K. plays a police officer that meets Emilia & Jai in 1984-he is a rookie cop-and again in 2017. If you have seen the trailer, Arnold looks older, with graying hair, which is explained by saying the human tissue on his Terminator body is real living human tissue, so it ages just like a normal human's does. About one minute into the end credits, there is a scene-so, don't get up too early-but there is nothing at the very end. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language and partial nudity and has a running time of 2 hours & 5 minutes. As I said earlier, if you are a fan, you should enjoy this installment. I know I did and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Terminator Genisys
88,dee.reid,"He's back, so enjoy this fun, crazy fifth outing in this legendary sci-fi series!",8,16 November 2015,"2015's ""Terminator Genisys"" is the fifth entry in the outstanding ""Terminator"" franchise that was first launched in 1984 by James Cameron, who first wrote and directed ""The Terminator"" - the film that would launch his career as a groundbreaking special effects maverick. While ""The Terminator"" was largely a low-budget independent box office hit and a product of a vastly different (and now-largely forgotten) era and technology, ""Terminator Genisys"" is the latest big-budget Hollywood summer spectacle to feature lots of special effects and serve as epic, first-class popcorn entertainment.Of course, ""The Terminator"" envisioned a war-torn future in which human survivors of a nuclear holocaust called Judgment Day are engaged with malevolent machines - controlled by a rogue A.I. called Skynet - that are bent on our destruction. Said machines think that they can win the war by default: they'll send one of their own, an indestructible human-looking cyborg called a Terminator, back in time to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, the woman who will give birth to the future leader of the human resistance, John Connor, who will eventually lead the humans to victory over the machines. Connor sends a trusted young soldier, Kyle Reese, to protect his mother in the past and stop the Terminator.""The Terminator"" is my all-time favorite science fiction film, and Cameron would up the ante with its 1991 sequel, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" which would be the film to officially usher in the CGI age. Over the years, however, as the series continued, the introduction of alternate time-lines and constant attempts to change the future by journeying to the past, would complicate things so seriously that fans engaged in endless online debates about the nature of time travel and the effect it had on the ""Terminator"" film franchise.A lot of this fan speculation and craziness seems to come to a head with ""Terminator Genisys,"" which again involves a plot by Skynet to kill John Connor in the past, as well as something called Genisys, which is pretty much like a cloud on steroids. Beginning in Los Angeles 2029 A.D., the human resistance has captured a Skynet stronghold where the machines were experimenting with time travel. John Connor (Jason Clarke) sends Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back in time to protect Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) from the first Terminator.Here, we see a rather faithful recreation of the early scenes from ""The Terminator,"" complete with the first Terminator, the younger 1984 version of the character played by Arnold Schwarzenegger (through creative digital enhancements), before it is accosted by another, older version of the same character, again played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. (This early scene, largely played for giggles and nostalgia, is worth the admission price alone.)In this same 1984, arrives Reese. However, he quickly discovers that this is not the same 1984 that he was informed about by John Connor in the future and even more shockingly, there are already Terminators here waiting for him. The most lethal of these appears to be another version of the shape-changing, liquid-metal android T-1000 (played here by Korean action star Byung-hun Lee) from ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" Reese is also surprised to discover that Sarah Connor is the not damsel in distress he was sent to protect, and has already morphed into the ass-kicking heavy-hitter that she was in ""T2"" when the character was played by Linda Hamilton (and it is rumored that Clarke's casting here may have been done so to lure in her fans from her role on ""Game of Thrones,"" even if her portrayal of Sarah is more ""hip"" than Hamilton's ""tough"").To divulge any more of the plot runs the risk of spoilers, and the epic fun to be had here. Yeah, all the time traveling here can make your head hurt, and spin it around in massive circles. We go backward and forward through time, from 2029 to 1984, with talks of 1997 and finally arriving in 2017. Along the way, we also meet a psychiatrist named O'Brien (J.K. Simmons), an ex-cop who first encountered Reese and the Terminator back in 1984. And Reese somehow or another comes into contact with his younger self, which may or may not hold clues as to how to defeat Skynet in this revised time-line.""Terminator Genisys"" appears to come more or less after ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" and seems to wisely disregard ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" (2003) and does pay some attention to the grunginess of the most recent sequel, ""Terminator Salvation"" (2009); I don't know, I personally really liked ""Terminator Salvation"" and consider it to be the best film after the original 1984 film (don't get me wrong, I love ""T2"" to death, but ""Salvation"" just went straight to the Future War).Alan Taylor (""Thor 2: The Dark World"") directed ""Terminator Genisys"" from a script co-authored by Laeta Kalogridis (""Shutter Island"") and Patrick Lussier (""Drive Angry"") that puts in way too many head-scratchers to keep track of everything going on here. Chronologically, this film may appear after the events of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" so does this film mean that it's a reboot or a genuine sequel? Who knows for sure?The one plus in all this frenzied Terminator-generated time travel non-sense is the fact that James Cameron himself was added as a consultant on this picture's production; this thus explains his early exclamations that we were going to love this movie (along with ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""). And the film's score - by Lorne Balfe - pays some homage to Brad Fiedel's classic percussion-driven synthesizer-based score from the first two ""Terminator"" films directed by Cameron.""Terminator Genisys"" was a fun thrill ride, even if it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense in the end. I would consider it a worthy entry in the ""Terminator"" franchise - personally, my fourth favorite in the series, after ""The Terminator,"" ""Terminator Salvation,"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day.""8/10",Terminator Genisys
89,Jackbv123,Fits franchise well,7,30 July 2017,Having an aging Arnold Schwarzenegger is great. It ties in and brings back memories of the early Terminator movies. Arnie does a great job with dead-pan jokes. They were way funnier than a lot of jokes in so called funny movies today. It just seemed right to have him.First time I've seen Emilia Clarke not blonde. I didn't recognize her but I think she is way prettier than as Daenerys or for that matter than her IMDb profile picture. Is it ironic that she plays same character as Lena Headey did? She is a totally different look and it take a while to accept her as bad-ass here because she is so tiny and even kind of girl-next-door looking.There are some nice twists and it is totally not a remake of the first Terminator.,Terminator Genisys
90,XweAponX,He Came Back,10,23 September 2015,"I just gotta give it a 10 because I gave all of the other T- Movies a 10, even Slave-Ation. Actually I liked that one slightly more than this one.But this one, well it has a great start. It shows what must have happened in the future of the first Terminator Moovie: it gives us a great image of that, even though this version of John Connor looks like ""Ugly Lenny"" - The bass Player of the Punk Rock band ""Social Spit"". And, I thought Anthony Yelchin was a much better ""Young Kyle Reese"" than this guy, who was it? Oh Yah Jai Courtney. Yelchin should have done it, they should have brought back either Nick Stahl or Christian Bale for John Conner rather than Jason ""Ugly Lenny"" Clark.But, I just cringed through yet another change in main character casting and went with it.So, the idea is that some one or thing is interfering with the Timeline. Star Trek's ""Temporal Prime Directive"" has been shattered as well as totally ignored. The ""Ripple Effect"" from Farscape Wormholes is in total play here, so many things have gotten changed that it's not the same Universe anymore.Ergo, giving the producers of this flick the ability to write in an aged Arny as a ""Protectimator"". Face it, no T-800 series Terminator ever lasted longer than a few days, even though they can live for 120 years, according to T-2 Judgement Day. We've just never seen it happen. Until now.I like a lot of things about this, but I don't like an equal amount of things. Namely, we have a T-800 sent back in time to prevent a T-1000 attack when Sarah ""Conna"" was a kid! Said protector picks up Sarah and basically raises her like his/it's own.So when Kyle Reese shows up the first ting he runs into is another or the same T1000, who looks like Byung-Hun-Lee instead of Robert Patrick/John Doggett. Same kind of Jaw though.Then they have to use a Time Diaplacement Portal made by Arny to go to 1997? Nope, 2016! It's just never explained who sent the T-800 back in the first place, there seem to be terminators and guardians sent all over the Timeline. Maybe The ""Fizzle Bomber"" (From ""Predestination"") will show up and blow up the whole franchise.",Terminator Genisys
91,alindsay-al,An average film that will disappoint many,5,4 July 2015,"Finally after 6 years we have a new terminator film but I am hear to report that Terminator Genisys is a completely average film and a film that you will not remember. The premise of this film sees a retelling of the first terminator film as John Connor sends Kyle Reese back to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor but it turns out that events have changed and judgement day can be stopped. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the terminator and he is easily the best part of this film, he totally went back to his roots and brought the terminator back to life. The best comedic moments and dramatic moments come from his performance and he is still good in the action scenes and his character was so cool. Now to the supporting cast, Jason Clarke from dawn of the planet of the apes plays John Connor and he delivers a decent performance and I liked the fact that his character had different layers to him and he has to play a couple of different characters. Now for some reason you haven't seen the trailer or poster I won't reveal the twist involving his character but I actually liked the twist more then I thought I would. Emilia Clarke plays young Sarah Connor and she does a good job in the role and you really feel like she was playing a younger Linda Hamilton and she stayed true to the performance and it ended up being good. Now jai Courtenay plays Kyle Reese and my god this guy is one of the most boring and dull actors in the world. Not only does his look go against the character but his chemistry with the other characters really doesn't hit at all and it really hurts the film as it focuses on him way too much. Jk Simmons is great in this film but the problem is that he is barely in the film and I felt cheated out of a longer appearance by him and the same goes for Matt Smith. Now the story is where this film really fails, if it was just a retelling of the first terminator film but with a few different events then this film could have been really good. But this film takes a completely unnecessary twist that really makes this film convoluted and with way too much going on. By the end of the film you will wonder why you truly watched this film. The script was pretty awful, the dialogue just doesn't work and it really does its best to hurt these characters. The only thing that is good is Arnold with his one liners and jokes that makes this film work. There are some good action scenes especially the future scenes in the first 20 minutes but the problem is that allot of the action scene have no weight to them and you have seen it done allot better and some of the cgi used just looks really weird and takes you out of the film. Overall this film is completely average and it fails to reinvigorate the terminator franchise.",Terminator Genisys
92,estebangonzalez10,"Hit the reset button, here we go again.",6,4 July 2015,"""Come with me if you want to live.""After four Terminator films it was about time someone actually hit the reset button for this fifth installment of the franchise directed by Alan Taylor. Now that the series has been refreshed we will be expecting at least two more sequels, but fortunately James Cameron will be back to direct them because these films haven't come close to the high standards set by the first two. Terminator Genisys opens with a lot of promise as it begins as sort of a prequel where John Connor and Kyle Reese are fighting as part of the Resistance against the machines. As they are about to destroy Skynet, the machines send back a T-800 to kill Sarah Connor, and in order to protect her Kyle volunteers to go back (which explains the events that took place in the original Terminator), but a series of unexpected events take place and the original timeline is altered so everything has been reset. Screenwriters, Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier, came up with an interesting premise for this sequel which takes into consideration much of the Terminator mythology. It does however take a huge risk considering it basically erases the canon set by the first two Terminator films. Unfortunately what began with promise started to lose its appeal near the end as the action and the pacing began to drag while the twists kept on piling on each other. This sequel will satisfy those audience members who are simply looking to have a good time and marvel at the special effects, but those who are hoping it to match the quality of the original two films will be left very disappointed. I'd argue that this film doesn't even want to compete with them, but rather simply stand out as a forgettable fun blockbuster sequel, and it does.Emilia Clarke takes over Hamilton's role playing the iconic Sarah Connor, while its Jason Clarke's turn to be John Connor (the fourth different actor to do so in the same number of films). Jai Courtney gets to take on the role of Kyle Reese, who also happens to be the narrator of the film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is also back as the young T-800 who is sent back in time to kill Sarah and as a Guardian who is sent to protect her when she was a child in the alternating timeline. The film begins in 2029 as the Resistance is facing off Skynet and then it jumps back to 1984 when Terminator and Reese are sent to the past, but once the timeline has been altered they travel to 2017 where most of the film takes place. The plot may be a bit confusing for some since there are many twists and eventually it hurts the film. The third act involving a bus in the Golden Gate Bridge followed by a helicopter chase does get a bit ridiculous, but I guess those are the scenes many people pay money to go see. There is something about the premise in all these sequels where there are so many alternating timelines developing that it eventually hurts the franchise because you come to expect that no matter what the heroes do to prevent Judgement Day there will always be some alternative for it to resurface again, and the same could be said about saving Sarah Connor. After a while you're simply watching these action scenes and thinking to yourself what's the point because even if they succeed there will be something else they will have to do in the next movie to prevent Judgement Day from happening all over again. So most of the emotional thrills from the original films gets lost here because there isn't much more at stake. What this film does succeed at is in its inclusion of some humor revolving around Arnold Schwarzenegger's character and J.K. Simmons. Each time the action sequences or the drama began to drag the film down, the light touches of humor made it more bearable. I was really looking forward to what Emilia Clarke could add to the character of Sarah Connor considering I love her performance in Game of Thrones, but surprisingly it was Jai Courtney who got most of my sympathy. It might not be fair to blame Clarke considering Sarah Connor is such an iconic character, but Clarke never manages to reach the same level Linda Hamilton did. Having said that however I still did like her in this film, but she never steals the show. Courtney on the other hand is an actor I've never really liked, but in this film he shows some potential and carries each action scene he's in. Schwarzenegger is the best thing about Genisys and it was great to see him having fun playing the character that turned him into a star. He delivers each one-liner better than any machine could ever do. He makes the film worth it. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Terminator Genisys
93,iquine,Convoluted Story,5,15 September 2017,"(Flash Review)What do Marty McFly and Kyle Reese have in common? There are multiples of themselves in various time lines. Only Back to the Future made seeing it play out fun and clever. Light spoilers but it really won't matterI was hoping the movie would really build up the pre-story way before T1 happened but it was more about zipping between 1984, 1997 and future years. And in the process they pretty much made the T1 & T2 story lines irrelevant! Boooo. They should at least built them up and made them matter more. The movie also just rehashed T1 & T2 memorable effects and scenes. The liquid metal terminator is back, only Asian and uses the same techniques and the first guy. They should have made to him do new and cools things. They did a bad CGI of Arnold from T1 and they remade some scenes for retro gags but was not as cool when Marty doubled back on himself making out with his 'mom' in the car scene. The time travel tried to be like Inception but was kind of confusing and they used too many unfair plot twists; I almost dozed off near the end. Overall, it was mindless summer action fluff that didn't help the Terminator series at all.",Terminator Genisys
94,Fluke_Skywalker,Still a few sparks of life in this Terminator,6,1 February 2016,"The first two 'Terminator' films are classics, with the latter serving as a perfect capper. What has followed has delivered a series of diminishing returns, muddying the mythology with increasingly implausible (and uninteresting) scenarios, because, Time Travel! 'Genisys' gets pretty murky where all of that is concerned, but despite a host of issues I still think--simply as a generic popcorn action flick--it kinda works, if unevenly so. The first act has some fun moments, retracing familiar steps from a slightly altered point of view, but after that it gets a little ham-handed, succeeding mostly in fits and starts. The cast is okay, and their job is certainly unenviable given the status of the original film. They wisely avoid mimicry and serve the story at hand well enough. Arnie manages to be both familiar and new with his fatherly ""Pops"" incarnation of the classic character, and not surprisingly most of the better moments belong to him (though his character is undeniably the third wheel here).We didn't need this sequel, and judging from popular opinion we didn't exactly want it either. But it's here, and for what it's worth I believe that, while it doesn't exactly get the saga back on track, it is an improvement over the last few outings.",Terminator Genisys

I think this has plenty of action and scifi to satisfy fans of the series, and they will love the revisiting of the original timeline and the references to it, though they might or might not like the ""rebooted"" version of it. I liked the continuous action and the new stories, and it draws comparisons to Back to the Future, about ""convergent timelines"" as well as new and different ones. Skynet changes everything in more ways than one! Fans will find more than one thing to like about this entry, and the cast works well together.

96,jimbo-53-186511,Considering what it had to live up to this is a surprisingly good effort,7,21 November 2019,"In the near future, robots controlled by a corporation called Skynet become self-aware and seeing mankind as a threat to them start to wipe out humanity. A small team of survivors (lead by John Connor) decide to fight back and manage to destroy Skynet. However, Skynet had a protocol in place to send a Terminator back in the past to terminate the mother of the leader of the resistance (if they were to lose the war) to prevent them being wiped out again in the future. Fearing for his future existence John sends Kyle Reese back in time to protect his mother, but John is unaware of the slightly altered past Kyle is being sent back to and is also unaware and unprepared for a guardian who is already watching over and protecting Sarah...Before I started watching this film I did fear the worst; after all it's the fifth film in a franchise that has been a little up and down over all after the first 2 films, but for me I'm pleased to say that this fifth film was a fairly solid offering.Although it seems to begin as a re-tread of the original film Genisys does slowly start to unravel and expand upon its plot - this is explained more when Kyle is sent back to the past. I did like the way that Skynet's evolution was expanded upon and explored here and the idea that computers could soon be taking over us all seems more like social commentary or science fact rather than the science fiction that such a concept could once be deemed as. In the main this is an entertaining film, but that's really what you have to both understand and expect with this film. James Cameron only directed the first 2 films (the best in the franchise by a mile) and had little involvement in any of the sequels aside from being credited as creating the characters. For me, his absence has been noticeable in each of the sequels - in this film it lacks the dark edge of the original films and almost has a comical feel to it; Taylor has given this film a light-hearted feel, but to be fair I didn't find it detrimental here and liked some of the comical touches it's just that it may not be for all tastes.It's fair to say that all the Terminator films (to some degree or another) have had time-travelling figuring in to the plot albeit to varying degrees, but in Genisys this becomes both a strength and a weakness. The strength to is that it allows for a richer and deeper plot and a greater expansion to the story (theoretically). The weakness with it is that it can make a film come across as messy and over-written and unfortunately at times Genisys does play out like this. The plot twist involving John Connor is silly and his transformation from hero to villain isn't that convincing. I liked Jason Clarke's performance overall, but I preferred him as a good guy in all honesty as I never found him particularly intimidating or terrifying as a villain. I would have preferred it if Byung-Hun-Lee who played the T1000 in the 1984 era would have featured more prominently as he was excellent and was very close to being as good as Robert Patrick was in Terminator 2.As far as the rest of the cast go then to be fair they do all do a very good job; Arnie is given more opportunity to be human here (which is explained in the narrative) and for me this is one of his strongest performances within the franchise. Emilia Clarke is solid in her role as Sarah Connor although she lacks Hamilton's tough edge, but given Taylor's light-hearted approach I don't blame Emilia as I suspect she was just following orders. Courtney is no Michael Biehn, but again I didn't think he put on a bad show here. Simmons is a good actor, but didn't have much to do here although it was nice to see him play a good guy here rather than cocky/arrogant or obnoxious characters that I'm usually used to seeing him portray.The special effects are OK although they are disappointing given the passage of time that has passed since 1991. Aside from some of the FX used on John Connor and an Arnie vs Arnie showdown they don't actually look that much more advanced than the first sequel that came out nearly 25 years earlier. Incidentally, whilst the early scenes pitting good Arnie vs bad Arnie are impressive from a modern technology perspective their fight scene does look clumsy and has a very artificial feel to it (we all know it's real Arnie facing a CGI special effect of himself, but the audience should still be able to feel that they are watching Arnie fight a younger version of himself, but it's all too obvious that this isn't happening here which did reduce the impact of this scene as far as I was concerned).Still when looked upon on an expectations vs outcome I can definitely say that the outcome far exceeded my expectations and for those who have enjoyed the franchise so far (including T3 and Salvation) I think that you'll enjoy this one even in spite of the weaknesses that I have mentioned.",Terminator Genisys
97,sauravjoshi85,Should we consider this movie as a downfall of one of the greatest movie series??,4,22 May 2021,"Terminator Genisys is a Sci-fi action movie directed by Alan Taylor and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Clarke, Jai Courtney, Emilia Clarke and J. K. Simmons.This is the fifth part of the Terminator series.With this movie we can presume that this series is now on it's downfall and the makers have nothing new to offer and they are trying to cash on the name of the franchise, this movie isn't that bad and can be a good one time watch but considering the standard the series has achieved more was expected from them.John Connor send Kyle Reese back in 1984 to safeguard his mother thus saving the future but due the timeline is altered and now they have to travel to 2017 to destroy Skynet and save mankind and this is the movie is all about.After watching the movie it can be easily presumed that the makers are still in the hangover of destroying Skynet and saving mankind, the same is been shown in the previous movie and again in this movie with some modifications in the storyline.Acting is good to average, Arnie has now started looking monotonous in the character although he will not disappoint you. Jason Clarke and Jai Courtney were decent and Emilia Clarke irritates, she was trying to show that she is very strong headed woman and knows everything and in order to do so she irritates. I think she was overly excited to be a part of Franchise. J. K. Simmons what a waste of his talent, I am still not been able to understand why did he accepted this character, he has been totally wasted.Screenplay of the movie is predictable and average, the screenplay will neither bore you nor excites you, Action scenes also doesn't excites much and the climax of the movie is predictable and it seems that it had been shot in hurry. There are some funny and senseless scenes in the movie, it's been understandable that all the Terminators above T-1000 can't be killed with bullets then what is the point of keep hitting them with bullets, there are many such scenes which makes no sense.In my opinion the downfall of a great series has started with this movie, this movie is majorly a disappointed and a hard core fan of the series like me is sad after watching the movies like this.",Terminator Genisys

100,3xHCCH,"Inconsistent, Illogical, Yet Still Impelling",7,5 July 2015,"""The Terminator"" (1984) is one of the best futuristic action films of the 1980s. Its sequel ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991) was even better with its Oscar-awards winning technical aspects. That is why even after two more not-so-good sequels, the franchise name is still strong enough to eke out a reboot thirty years after the first film.The first part of the film echoes the first film very closely. The artificial intelligence Skynet is controlling the world, developing killer cyborgs called Terminators to eradicate humanity. John Connor leads the human resistance against Skynet, and they were actually winning. Skynet sends a Terminator back in time to the year 1984 to kill John's mother, Sarah Connor, before John even existed. John sends his most trusted soldier Kyle Reese back to protect his mother. However, when Kyle meets Sarah, she was not the helpless waitress he was expecting. It turns out that the fabric of time had been altered so that since the age of 9, Sarah had been raised and trained in warfare by her own reprogrammed guardian Terminator, whom she lovingly called Pops. After defeating a T-1000 sent from the future to kill him. Kyle, together with Sarah and Pops, teleport to the year 2017, a year he heard in random clips of memory he had of his childhood. Their aim was to locate John Connor and destroy Skynet even before it gets launched.The first part of this film was fun to watch for those of us who had seen the first film. We see the young Arnold T-800 teleport to earth, the punks, the department store, and the images of the first movie come flashing right back. We hear Sarah say, ""Come with me if you want to live"" again, and of course, Schwarzenegger will say, ""I'll be back!""Problems of logic start to crop up when we begin to hear about time travel issues which the writers explain with pseudo-physics jargon. I suggest to just sit back and stop analyzing these probable plot holes and errors which are really bound to crop up whenever time travel is used as a device in films.Arnold Schwarzenegger was so good to see as Pops. His presence in this film prevents it from being forgettable. He is so iconic an actor that despite some cheesy lines he was made to deliver here, he remains to be cool and hip, old but not obsolete (in his own words). Only Schwarzenegger can pull off this role of the Terminator. No one could ever replace him in a future reboot and succeed. If you have seen the first two films, then you can see some obvious problems with the casting of the rebooted Sarah and Kyle. As a Game of Thrones fan, I was excited to see the Khaleesi Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor. However, while her acting was OK, her screen presence as action heroine is lacking. This is especially since they had already altered her history that she had already been training for battle since she was nine years old. Then by the time Kyle sees her, she should already have looked as buff as Linda Hamilton circa T2, shouldn't she? Ms. Clarke's arms do not have the muscular definition to convince us that she can even carry, much less fire, such high-power weaponry.Jai Courtney, what can I say? I felt like he was miscast as John McClane's son Jack in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" (2013). Now in this film, Courtney felt wrong as Kyle Reese. The Kyle we knew from the first film portrayed by the intense Michael Biehn was nothing like how Courtney played Kyle here. There was no connection, as if they were different people altogether. However, those viewers watching this film as their first Terminator film will probably find Courtney OK as well. Although, there is no real romantic spark that credibly developed between Courtney and Clarke at all.Oddly, even if the CG technology for films should be much more advanced now, the breakthrough special visual effects of ""Terminator 2"" remain to be more impressive and memorable. The shape-shifting liquid metal T-1000 we see here is basically the same as what we saw back in 1991. Only this time T-1000 was portrayed by Korean actor Lee Byung-hun, instead of Robert Patrick.So, overlooking these inconsistencies with the original films and the time travel illogicalities aside, ""Terminator Genisys"" is actually a fun and exciting futuristic sci-fi action film. The time-jumping storyline was actually not hard to follow if you just simply accept the premises they throw at you. Schwarzenegger is there to hold the whole thing together so the whole film still comes out in one entertaining piece for most audiences. An extra scene in the middle of the end credits actually promise another sequel. 7/10.",Terminator Genisys
101,JoeKarlosi,Terminator Genisys (2015) ***,7,5 July 2015,"I had severe doubts that this old worn-out series could be successfully revisited at such a late point in time, but wow was I wrong! This fifth installment for me ranks third best of the franchise, following just after 1 and 2. Not a great movie, but a fun popcorn ride which is all the fans should expect. Arnold Schwarznegger makes a triumphant return to the saga as a protective terminator fondly nicknamed ""Pops"", and the plot point which explains his reappearance as an elder-looking cyborg was smartly written.The core of the story: we revisit the original's plan in having the futuristic John Connor (Jason Clarke) sending Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to 1984, except that this time a mishap alters the events as they first played out in Cameron's THE TERMINATOR. For one thing, Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) has now been awaiting Reese's arrival, and so has her longtime friend and guardian, older T-800, Pops (Arnold). No need to spoil how and why things have drastically shifted ... it's best left to view for yourself... but somehow this idea makes for a workably rebooted jumpstart that mostly delivers all the expected goods. Though one needs to pay close attention, the script offers satisfactory explanations as to why its characters are now thrust into different positions. Schwarzenegger fits back into his T shoes comfortably; it's like he never left the movies for politics. There are the usual quibbles as in most of today's action free-for-all's -- perhaps too many lingering fight scenes, and an unnecessary surprise at the end (sigh). I thought Emilia Clarke looked too young as Sarah in comparison to the original's Linda Hamilton (though Clarke is up to the performance), and Jai Courtney isn't the greatest physical match for Michael Biehn. But, like I said -- quibbles. This is an entertaining Terminator romp. *** out of ****",Terminator Genisys
102,TdSmth5,Terrible,3,4 October 2015,"So here comes yet another retelling of the John Connor/Sarah Connor story. How many times can Hollywood tell the same story? Apparently countless.This time around in the future, John Connor and his guys wipe out most or all of Skynet. They decide to send Kyle Reese back to the 80s to protect Sarah from the Terminator. As he's about to be teleported to the past, one of Skynet's robot things grabs John.During the teleportation Kyle has visions of his younger self remembering a phrase: Genisys is Skynet. In the 80s he's attacked by the liquid terminator. He runs into a Sarah and an old-fashioned T but as it turns out it is Sarah's buddy and protector. Now they decide to teleport a couple of years later to the day when Genisys, a sort of omnipresent internet+internet of things, is about to be launched. Why not just go to some time before and take out the guys developing this? Don't ask. Cops and Homeland Security are after them, but one cop, who was saved in the 80s by Kylie has been studying this stuff and has some idea what's going on. But his character gets little to do. It doesn't take long until the liquid T shows up in a surprising guise and countless fights ensue. They decide to blow up the Genisys facility minutes before it goes online. Time travel paradox be damned, here Kyle meets his younger self. And of course after it's all over, guess whether that's the end of it or not.Very little about Terminator Genisys works. At least Salvation had Christian Bale as John, here some unknown. But it does have Arnold. Why he signed up for this mess, who knows. The story barely works but what it all amounts to is two invincibles fighting each other eternally, kinda like watching the lame fight between the other two invincibles in Avengers 2, the green thing and the guy in the tin suit. What's the point of these fights anyway, no one is injured, defeated, no one dies, no one changes his mind. The fights here are fairly weak, things get mildly entertaining at the end. Some of the bigger action sequences look awful. So in terms of story, this movie is nothing special, in terms of action, this movie fails miserably. The cast and characters are pretty atrocious. Aside from Arnold, everyone else here is acting as if they were doing some foreign-market copy of Terminator. The lovely Emilia Clarke looks far less lovely for some reason and her character will go down in movie history as one of the most annoying ever. When are those who decide what makes a woman look good going to put an end to hideous giant eyebrows already? The rest of the cast is equally questionable. And couldn't they have hired some Americans for a change? What is this Hollywood love affair with Brits all of the sudden? Basically, if you're an American actor who is Caucasian, you can forget about finding work in Hollywood.If you haven't seen Terminator Salvation, check it out, now that's an action blockbuster.

105,robertemerald,Special effects and explosions galore,9,10 January 2019,"This is a true blockbuster, never letting up, going from one wow to the next (and often) for all of two hours. Its great value popcorn fun, full of unbelievable fight scenes, hold on tight car chases and mountainous explosions. The particle effects were blistering! It's hard to review without giving away its secrets. Think of T3 on steroids, with a dash of Terminator Salvation to begin. I had to dock a star for its timeline being a total confusion, along with 3 terminators to deal with. If this is going to be a person's first Terminator experience you may be scratching your head here and there. Wonderful leads though, with a really pleasing script and dialogue. However I would watch T3 first if your a novice to this franchise.",Terminator Genisys
106,davidmvining,Crazy Stupid,3,29 March 2021,"This movie is crazy, but not the kind of crazy from a talented artist doing the unexpected. No, it's the kind of crazy of the untalented having no idea what to do with a property that's not their own, has a well-established formula that they can't escape, and is trying desperately to make up for someone else's failure in the previous entry. I kind of feel bad for Alan Taylor, the director. He was a well-established television director who decided to try and make it in the movies, so he ended up striking out into the film business by making the worst Terminator movie after having made the worst movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thor: The Dark World.Interestingly enough, in an effort to try and regain the footing of the franchise, Taylor and his writers, Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier, made what is essentially a direct sequel to the first film of the series. You could know nothing of the story from Terminator 2 on and not get lost regarding the opening of the film. It shows, in quick order, the final days of the fight against the machines in the future from Kyle Reese's perspective. Reese is played by Jai Courtney and the filmmakers decided to fix the charisma blackhole that was Sam Worthington in Salvation by, um, hiring another weirdly uncharismatic action man. He was underwhelming as Jack McClane in A Good Day to Die Hard, and he's underwhelming here with flat line readings and an extremely limited range. He's at John Connor's side, played by Jason Clarke, very good in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and serviceable here, and they make the final push to the time displacement device where John will send Kyle back in time to 1984 to save John's mother Sarah from the Terminator just sent back.When Kyle does go back, the movie is a weird mix of recreation of the original film's opening (plus a whole lot more exposition) with a bunch of new, crazy twists. Another pair of Terminators got sent back to the 70s one saved young Sarah and has served as her guardian ever since. They know that 1984 will see another Terminator show up, so they arrive, the guardian and Sarah destroy the original Terminator, and then a T-1000 attacks Kyle Reese when he shows up. Sarah arrives to help protect him, but this T-1000 never gets any kind of explanation. I know that there were plans to turn this into the first film of a proposed sequel, so I think it's safe to assume that the T-1000 would have been explained in a later movie. However, because that movie was never made, we just have action beats without any explanation. This is a testament to treating a film as a complete story no matter what your plans are for the future beyond it. If things don't work out, you just have unexplained nonsense running around, distracting from the story at hand.Then the movie gets really dumb. Sarah and her guardian have been building a time displacement device on their own, and they plan on going to 1996 to prevent Judgment Day. Why not 1994 like in Terminator 2? Why wait for the last moment? I don't know. But Kyle, when he was coming back in time, had visions of a childhood he never had that tells him to go back to 2017 instead to defeat something called Genisys. So, he convinces these two, who've had a plan to go to 1996 for at least ten years, to, at the last second, go twenty years further ahead in time. The two humans go, leaving the guardian behind to go the long way and repair the damage to his flesh from his fight with the T-1000. Of course, the machine ends up late to the precise moment the two come out and they are immediately taken in by cops.Do you know how long all of this takes? About an hour. Half of the movie is dedicated to just getting to the second half, justifying a recreation of the first movie with little to no explanation for half of the changes, and characters explaining all of this to each other. It's boring. The antagonist from the first half gets killed and completely forgotten when they go to 2017, and the movie essentially resets with a new conflict, or, more accurately, it actually gains a central conflict, but it only has about 50 minutes of screen time to do it all and thin, uninteresting characters who need to quickly fall in love through it all to manage it.Of course there's the big twist that the studio spoiled in the trailers because they realized that the movie was terrible and they weren't going to be able to rely on word of mouth to draw people in so they decided to just spoil everything to do what they could to attract audiences. It seems to have worked, by the way, since Genisys was the second highest grossing film of the franchise. Anyway, John travels back in time to 2014, having been turned into a Terminator by Skynet, and builds Genisys as the precursor to Skynet.There are a few problems with the execution of this idea. I have nothing against the idea itself, but the filmmakers made no effort to give it any impact. The fact that John Conner has been played by about a thousand different actors in the official franchise doesn't help us automatically have any emotional connection to him as a person. In fact, in the last movie he was so thoroughly unlikeable that Christian Bale was one of the largest problems with it. Making it weirder is that the film is abandoning Terminator 2 and 3 when John Conner was an actual character and at least somewhat likeable. So, the movie only has its opening and Kyle's connection to John there as a base for the kind of switch up they're trying, but it was too brief, too shallow, and too long before for the shock to have any real impact. The fact that he doesn't appear again until so late in the picture, the reunion where we are meant to think he's a good guy is too brief and emotionally shallow, and then the reveal of his true nature happens too quickly. We barely have time to settle into the idea of John being there at all before he turns bad. It's whiplash.Then the plot finally kicks in with about forty minutes left in the film. The trio of good guys have to make it to Genisys and blow it up with John on their tails. They end up getting arrested right as things seem to be building up, get out of jail quickly because why not, and then make it to Genisys where the final action beats play out. At least in Salvation, the action scenes were interesting to watch in the midst of all the awful storytelling, but we don't even get that here. It's perfunctory at best, with flat framing and an overreliance on computer generated imagery that creates a far too clean feel to the action.This seems to have been rushed into production based on a cobbling of scripts with hopes of future films to provide clarification rather than spending time on this film itself to create a cohesive experience that could satisfy audiences. That it made the second most returns at the box office, but that still wasn't enough to justify a direct sequel is an entertaining irony. The producers had to relinquish their ownership of the property, allowing it to return to James Cameron's ownership. Nothing he produces could end up this incompetent, could it?",Terminator Genisys

I've been telling people for years that the dragon chick from Game of Thrones couldn't act to save her life. And this movie just helped to further prove my point. But other than what's her name, this film is sort of a laughable mess. It was written by a hipster, I'm calling it now. The stupid title can tell you as much. I really can not think of one redeemable thing about this picture other than Arnold, who surprisingly gave the best performance. But the lamest thing about the film is the story.",Terminator Genisys
108,Seraphion,"Great for nostalgia, but a bit slow on the action side",7,6 July 2015,"The movie starts with Kyle Reese's narration about how the future war have John Connor as hope, reminiscing John saving him from a terminator. John leads a side attack to Skynet's Los Angeles facility while another team attacks Skynet's core. The other team succeeds, Skynet is down, but not before it sent a Terminator back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor. Kyle is sent back, like the first movie. But as the time travel starts, Kyle sees John being attacked by a Terminator. As time travel continues, Kyle sees dual images of a past he never had. In 1984, Sarah's time-line had altered. She already has a protector in Pops, a Terminator who had already grown old. They cooperated in killing the terminator sent back. In 1984 Kyle finds he's expected by Sarah. After a moment of prejudice, Kyle helps Sarah and Pops in dealing with the T-1000 from the second movie, luring it to a sewer rigged with acid barrels that quickly dissolve the T-1000's metal.Sarah then reveal the plan; use the T-1000's CPU to power a homemade time machine and travel to the future to stop Skynet on Judgment Day in 1997. But Kyle convinces them to go to 2017. His hand's flesh dissolved battling the T-1000, Pops can't go with them and waits it out until 2017. Arriving in 2017, Kyle and Sarah get arrested due to an 'explosion'. An old cop O'Brien, saved by Kyle while battling T-1000 in 1984, recognizes the two and followed them. To Kyle and Sarah's surprise, John Connor visits them and bails them out. John reveals to Kyle that he's John's father. Pops arrives and directly shoots at John, who turned out to be a Terminator. John reveals that he was transformed by Skynet. Kyle manages to trap John with an MRI magnetic field.In Pops' safe house, Kyle states that his dual past might be the key. He remembers memorizing the new OS Genisys is Skynet's cover, on countdown to upload to everything electronic. The plan changes to destroying Genisys before it launches. John finds the safe house and after an action packed road sequence they escape him, although again getting arrested. O'Brien comes and they convince him to set them loose. They fly to Cyberdine. Again they face John and also Skynet, speeding up the countdown. They get into a standoff where John holds Sarah hostage. Kyle comes and Pops battles John, destroying the detonator. Sarah and Kyle escapes Skynet's trap and help Pops trap John in the magnetic reactor which destroys John.Okay, the story really reinvented the rules about sagas, time travel movies, and even about rebooting movie franchises all together. I really like how the story took the road very least traveled and reconcile the needs between rebooting the franchise, holding on to the legacy of the saga, and delivering something entirely new. Sure, the movie itself has time travel as its core story element which determines much of how the story flows. But the movie did well to avoid the classic ""déjà vu"" problem of the time travel stories.Adding to the story is a really nice move done here. By recreating key scenes from the previous films, the movie supports its claim to the sagas's legacy besides having the original iconic actor for the Terminator. Also, the movie cleverly puts hints and potentials in the middle of the story for future exploration into more movies. There is the obvious mystery of who sent Pops back in time before 1984, and there's also even the question of how did Skynet obtained information to send after Sarah as a child.The action sequences are the second, if not even the most, important thing to talk about when we're talking about Terminator movies. In this installment I think the action is still very nice, though Arnold Schwarzenegger's age really limits the movie to be as wild as the first two movies did. There's one a few wilder car chase scene compared to the last Terminator when Arnold took part back in Rise of The Machines. Further, the whole action involving Arnold had already grown slower in movement, and more close up in shot distance.It's good that the movie really played very well on the nostalgic elements of the previous movies in the saga. This helps to at least reduce the effect of the slower action scenes to the older viewers. But this also has a double edge that the newer viewers who are more foreign to the saga will get it harder to absorb the story as a whole, particularly of this is the first movie they watch from the saga.After the good parts of the movie, I will say that the acting overall is quite disappointing although still a good one. Arnold's acting is very nice, as he relives his old persona as his most famous character the Terminator. Having Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor and Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese was really a high risk decision indeed. Although those characters have had different actors altogether, it's still hard for the two actors to plant a certain persona to them. Clarke's performance could handle the action, but she rally lack authenticity as an 80's girl. Her persona is also overshadowed by Linda Hamilton's or even Lena Heady's Sarah Connor. Jai Courtney could really increase his performance to match Clarke and Schwarzenegger's performances. Jason Clarke is already a natural in playing bad guys so his acting isn't bad.A score of 7 out of 10 is from me for Terminator Genisys (2015). A recommendation stands to go and see it in the cinemas. It's a true satisfaction for those who enjoy a mix of nostalgia and new things.",Terminator Genisys
109,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Terminator Genisys,5,3 July 2015,"It's hard to figure out who's playing John Connor these days (the seminal character from the Terminator franchise). We're talking four films and four different actors who look nothing alike. You have Edward Furlong from T2 (he's still working but I haven't noticed), Nick Stahl from Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (lately he's been procreating the rehab thing), Christian Bale from Terminator Salvation (here's a movie mogul who's already too big for his britches), and now Jason Clarke from Terminator Genisys (my latest review). Frankly, the casting directors seem to have been working overtime and now I've gotten to the point where I could care less. As for the plot workings of every Terminator casing, I get it. Skynet needs to fall, Judgement Day needs to be stopped, Sarah Connor needs to be protected, yada yada yada. Honestly, I just wanna see action, Arnold with his prickly one-liners and yes, more action. ""Genisys"" sadly, is more of a time traveling undertaking than anything else. And as far as those types go, the complicated ones just make my head hurt and my you know what itch. Yeesh!Now I get a lot of flak for this, but my favorite installment in this heralded film franchise has always been Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (followed by the first two outings from 84′ and 91′). It's the least complicated, has the tightest editing, contains the foxiest villain (T-X played by Kristanna Loken), and oh what a chase sequence (complete with the destruction of marked police cars, semi-trucks, and deluxe motorcycles). It's a popcorn flick and something you view during the opening days of summer. Terminator Genisys on the other hand, comes off as a watered-down version of everything doomsday. What's on screen is about as worthy as 2009's Terminator Salivation (mentioned earlier) and that can't be good.Anyway, I'm not predicting the future here (a huge topic concerning any synthetic intelligence exercise) but you gotta wonder how Terminator Genisys would do at the box office minus Arnold Schwarzenegger. I'm thinking it would not break even or just veer towards direct-to-video territory. Granted, this is Terminator as choppy, tedious art film fodder. The performances (featuring actors/actresses Jai Courtney, Emilia Clarke, and J.K. Simmons) aren't entirely compelling, the film score adds no element of darkness or despair, and the action scenes (of the bloodless, PG-13 variety) seem prosaic as ever. I will say though that director Alan Taylor effectively channels his inner Transcendence (2014). A lot of special effects shots give off a serious whiff of all things graphite and glitter (no pun intended on the Donald Fagen ditty, ""I.G.Y."").All in all, I would skip this 2015 release and just stick to the essentials (Terminators 1, 2, and 3). And if you decide to retaliate on my review and waste your $10, watch for Arnie blurting out his signature gab, ""I'll be back"". You'll exit the theater thinking why and how that could effectively be possible.Of note: (Spoiler alert) the biggest thing that irked me about ""Genisys"" was how it contained scenes altering various occurrences in 1984's The Terminator. You have Arnold's T-800 being eliminated early on with pretty much just one gunshot (please). As intimidating and devastating as his monster was in the classic original, this is nothing but a pure insult to any fan of the franchise. Also, the iconic Sarah Connor (now played by Emilia Clarke) is not a waitress in 1984. Instead, she's a soldier predetermined with an itchy trigger finger. Clarke though, sadly fails to resemble any sort of badassery that Linda Hamilton showed later on in the series.",Terminator Genisys
110,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It does entertain but the marketing shot itself in the foot,6,24 January 2016,"Arnold Schwarzenegger was one of the most popular actors of his time during the 1980s. His ability to rack up the body count and spew out catchy one liners was uncanny to say the least, especially for a foreign born actor. Fans love to recount his most famous roles but if there's ever one that he will forever be remembered for, that is his portrayal of the terminator throughout James Cameron's Terminator franchise. Unfortunately like all original movies with sequel after sequel, the franchise began to show its age. Fans of series were far from impressed with Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) and McG's Terminator: Salvation (2009). To be honest, they were not terrible films. What viewers didn't enjoy about them was they did not follow the same vein as the first two. The problem was that it was difficult to surpass the second act. Finally, fans saw Schwarzenegger return as the T-800 to this sequel that even creator James Cameron himself proclaimed to be the official sequel to T2 and the best sequel yet. So it was said.There is no doubt that the crew behind this looked to satisfy the large fan base. Yet, there were certain decisions that were made that seem careless. The biggest problem that outraged many fans was the trailer, which immediately spoiled the film by revealing John Connor was a terminator. This drops a lot of buildup to a surprising reveal. The plot to this story takes place during 2029. John Connor (Jason Clarke) and Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) just about defeat Skynet when the cycle begins all over again and a terminator is sent back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke). Reese is sent back but learns that things have changed and has leaped into another timeline where everything he thought is the exact opposite. The script was written by Laeta Kalogridis (Alexander (2004) and Shutter Island (2010)) and Patrick Lussier (Drive Angry (2011)) and for the most part it works. Even the John Connor spoiler was fine, that fault is on marketing.A component of the writing that is harder to come to grips with is the timeline element. The movie tries to sound sophisticated by having Arnold state scientific facts and information, but the whole idea sounds convoluted. However this can be skimmed over because no one knows for sure if this is really true, so audiences could suspend their disbelief. Here's where it gets confusing though, Cameron clearly stated that this is the 3rd official sequel to that of Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991). So why is it that some of the plot points within this movie's script have references to that of Terminator: Salvation (2009)? The film even deliberately ignores the events of McG's movie yet still indirectly references it? Which is it then? One other part of the writing that wasn't completely needed was unnecessary added roles. Specifically, J.K. Simmons and Byung- hun Lee play characters that are just there for convenience or nostalgia and not much else. There's no need to cram in everything.There is still a good amount of enjoyment to get in return though. Even with script's occasional overbloatedness, viewers of the film will have a nice ride surfing the wave of nostalgia the film provides. This wave is big; it has both auditory and visual references to the older films and even switches up the role of who does what (since it is an alternate timeline and all). The dialog equally matches the scenes filmed and the actors play off each other well. Schwarzenegger returns as the T-800 and continues to perform at his best. The dialog he's given feels no different than it was back in T2. Jai Courtney and Emilia Clarke have amiable chemistry, plus their development in their relationship isn't forced either. Even with all the flack Courtney has gotten for other films, he sounds like he's legitimately doing his best. Jason Clarke does his best too and although his role lost the buildup it could have had, he too acts like John Connor would. His scar makeup is grizzly looking.With the passing of special effects wiz Stan Winston in 2008, this second Terminator film does not receive his personal blessing. However, the special effects still look decent in action. Perhaps the only part that doesn't look right is the fully robotic T-800. They do not have the same tangible appearance like the others from past films. The cinematography is well lit, clear and has plenty of wide scope shots to boot. The director of photography for this sequel was Kramer Morgenthau who also worked on Thor: The Dark World (2013) with director Alan Taylor (who directed this sequel). Producing the film score is Scottish composer Lorne Balfe. Thankfully, Balfe continues to reuse Brad Fiedel's main theme from the original films and has the right emotional cues for the softer moments as well. The executive music producer was none other than Hans Zimmer and anyone who follows scores should be able to pick where Zimmer influenced it. It could be worse but it isn't.The writing can get a bit confusing and it also has some unnecessary role casting but it doesn't bring it down too much. The main cast works very hard, the action is entertaining and the music sticks appropriately to its roots. Now if only the marketing department left out the huge John Connor spoiler in their trailers.",Terminator Genisys
111,Rob_Taylor,"Worry, Confusion, Relief, Appreciation, Enjoyment. The 5 stages of watching this movie.",7,10 August 2015,"Yep, I experienced all those, in order. So let's take them one at a time:Worry: I had heard a lot of negative things about the film, the actors and the plot. Going in, I was expecting disappointment. The one thing I knew that gave me any hope was that Christian Bale wasn't in it. A slim shred of light, but it was something.Confusion: Once it started rolling, the movie confused me. At first it seemed like a straightforward rehash of the first/second Terminator movies, with some faithful recreations of T1 scenes, but then... weird stuff started happening that wasn't in those movies. I blinked, I wondered, I scratched my head trying to make sense of it.Relief: As I realised they weren't simply retreading the same story. They were changing it up and taking old concepts and giving them new life. The weird stuff began to make sense. None of the actors sucked!Appreciation: At the effort put in to make the story different enough to keep your interest. No slavish copying here. Take the old story and say ""What if..."" with the time-travel concept.Enjoyment: At a movie that was smart enough to poke fun at itself a few times and not devolve into farce. A feeling of entertainment and having a bit of fun with the materiel would be something a lot of Marvel movies could do with taking on board.All in all, I was very pleasantly surprised by Terminator Genisys. Entertaining and enjoyable, I never felt bored.There were some things that were overcooked - the helicopter chase for instance - and some that didn't quite work out - little chemistry between Jai Courtney and Emilia Clarke's characters - but overall, it wasn't a disgrace.Courtney wasn't bad in this movie (and I have an intense dislike of him so that is something) and Emilia Clarke proves that she will have an acting life after Game of Thrones. Arnold is, of course, Arnold, so no surprises there.It still doesn't hold a candle to Cameron's work, but unlike T3/4 it isn't a hollow sham of a sequel. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it is the most enjoyable Terminator sequel since T2, hands down. It is all about time-travel, of course, so it makes no sense at all with all the paradoxes (paradoxi?) involved, but just think alternate time-lines and it is all good.SUMMARY: Worth watching. Possibly the sequel to T2 that makes the most sense. Not the best Terminator film, but far from the worst!",Terminator Genisys
112,Sandcooler,"Pure nostalgia trip, but it's a sweet ride",9,13 July 2015,"If you're not a fan of the ""Terminator""-franchise, ""Genisys"" is definitely not the movie that will win you over. It's clearly made as a homage to the first two, but it's pretty much the best homage they could have made. Everything we know and love from the James Cameron entries is back. The action scenes are just breath-taking here, usually I don't like extensive use of CGI but here it actually makes the set pieces better. The inclusion of the young Arnold Schwarzenegger is a fantastic effect, it looks tremendously real. Speaking of Schwarzenegger, once again he really carries the movie. His character is played for laughs much more than usual, but it's definitely a smart change. His cheesy one-liners are a laugh riot, and it's obvious he's aware of that. He has so much fun with this role, and his enthusiasm is contagious. The new actors that play Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor are surprisingly convincing as well. Occasionally the movie goes a bit overboard with references to the previous entries (why does the new T-1000 also wear a cop uniform?), but that's easily forgivable. These people are fans, and occasionally they get too excited to being able to make a new ""Terminator""-movie. But who wouldn't be? ""Genisys"" isn't quite as overwhelming as ""Judgment Day"" was, but it's a huge step up from ""Rise Of The Machines"" and ""Salvation"".",Terminator Genisys
113,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Needless, pointless; this looks like bad fan fiction",3,27 September 2015,"John Conner (now putridly portrayed by Jason Clarke) sends Kyle Reese (now annoyingly portrayed by Jai Courtney) back to 1984 to save Sarah Connor (now absurdly portrayed by Emilia Clarke) from the Terminator (again portrayed by Ahnuld, the sole saving grace of this film) But when Reese arrives, we, the audience, find everything changed. Sarah is now an ass-kicking female Rambo, the Terminator is now 65 years-old Pops, and this viewer wonders how the characters would even realise any difference, unless the have watched the (vastly superior) first film. There are references left and right to the first film, but nothing advances the plot. Wait- what plot? There is no plot. Things happen, actors are present, but that is it. This looks like bad fan fiction, a generic Greatest Hits package of Terminator I and II, copying several scenes from the first two films, then throwing random dialogue and cartoonish action vignettes at the screen for the remainder of the run time. Amateurishly recast almost every returning character, which only makes this appear even more to be fan fiction. Emilia Clarke was cute, and she wasn't *bad*, but she was miscast. Most of the guns she used were as big as she was. Jason Clarke was awful, completely unlikeable and unsympathetic, so was Jai Courtney, who has all the charisma of a toilet plunger. Ahnuld was the best actor present, but his ""I'll be back"" routine should have been retired. The same can be said about ""Come with me if you want to live"". I'm tired of characters repeating other characters' catchphrases, that is not enough to base an entire film on. When they are finished belching old catchphrases again, a lot of the ensuing dialogue sounds like an old man arguing with his disobedient grandkids. This is what they reduced the frightening stalker/ killer from the first film, and the loyal hero of the second film to? The tone, overall, is far too lighthearted, considering the fate of humanity is at stake.Bah!And of course, there is the obligatory, contractually obligated setup for yet another needless sequel.",Terminator Genisys
114,moviexclusive,"If you can accept a revisionist sequel, you'll enjoy this fine piece of summer popcorn entertainment that perfectly captures the spirit and tone of the James Cameron originals",7,24 June 2015,"Three sequels and thirty-one years after James Cameron's seminal man-versus-machine science-fiction, 'Terminator Genisys' attempts to make the franchise relevant for a whole new generation by re-setting the clock. So here is as much advice as warning to fans – you'll do well not to cling too stubbornly to what you already know if you are going to appreciate the liberties which the filmmakers have taken in order to invigorate this aging series.Notwithstanding the initial fan uproar, we have to say that the screen writing duo of Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier have concocted an impressive scenario that balances a deep respect for the first two Cameron films and the need for new creative possibilities beyond the original Connor genealogy. How much of its predecessors to keep in mind is laid out in the prologue, which tells of the death of three billion people on Judgement Day itself and the resistance led by John Connor some thirty years thereafter. It is at that same fateful moment that Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) steps into the time machine to go back in time to protect Sarah that another Terminator from the future (played by Doctor Who's Matt Smith) attacks John, establishing a whole new chain of events while leaving Kyle with fractured memories from both parallel timelines.Indeed, though this Kyle arrives stark naked in the same dark and grungy alley of Cameron's first movie, the 1984 which he finds himself in is vastly different. For one, the T-100 which Skynet had sent to kill Sarah is upon its arrival greeted and terminated by a T-800, which as we earlier mentioned, has been no less than Sarah's guardian. For another, Sarah is no longer hapless and confused but a tough warrior who has been resisting the Terminators since her childhood days. And instead of Robert Patrick's T-1000, Kyle is welcomed by Lee Byung- hun's sleek, mercury-like killing machine, the choice to cast an Asian no doubt informed by modern-day blockbuster sensibilities.To its credit, the film does reflect the inevitable bewilderment of its fans in Kyle's struggle to reconcile the past he knows with flashbacks that he gained from the time jump – and for those who are wondering what the science behind it may be, Sarah's T-800 does offer some intellectual mumbo-jumbo in the form of a ""nexus point"". That same logic is also used to justify the new date for Judgment Day, which is now scheduled to take place in 2017 via an omnipresent operating system known as Genisys. Just as the original tapped into the zeitgeist's fears of technology, this reboot retains the same paranoia but updates it for the smartphone era of interconnected devices.As we are soon told, Genisys is no more than a cover for Skynet to unleash global annihilation with the help of none other than John Connor himself, who has undergone a ""machine phase matter"" evolution to become a Terminator. If there is one conceit on which this new premise rests on, it is the complete reinvention of John Connor's revolutionary leader, and Jason Clarke does an excellent job of making the character fearsome and formidable. His John Connor makes a perfect foil to Courtney's Kyle Reese, whose fresh-faced earnestness makes him an endearingly empathetic hero. Somewhat less convincing is Emilia Clarke's portrayal of a hardened Sarah Connor, especially when one recalls how compelling Cameron's ex-wife Linda Hamilton was in the role. In contrast, the Sarah here lacks Hamilton's combination of grit and vulnerability, which also in turn weakens the connection that she is supposed to develop with Kyle notwithstanding that we are foretold they are meant to fall in love and ""mate"" with each other.On the other hand, the franchise's most iconic star Arnold Schwarzenegger gets a pleasantly surprising breath of 'Terminator' roles with the parallel timelines – not only as the T-100 and T-800 we've seen him as, but also a much more visibly aged T-800 and a spiffy new upgrade right at the end. Schwarzenegger is still having fun turning his character's utter humourlessness into deadpan comedy – and besides trying to add new catchphrases like ""bite me"" and ""I'm old not obsolete"" into the lexicon, also has a field day trying to look friendlier by putting on a robotic smile. Though he isn't quite Cameron, Alan Taylor does a fine job keeping all the moving pieces together. As he did with 'Thor: The Dark World', Taylor demonstrates a workmanlike proficiency in summer blockbuster-making, alternating between deafening action sequences and obligatory exposition while interspersing the proceedings with cheeky self-aware humour and moments of obligatory poignancy. Unlike the entirely dour 'Terminator Salvation', Taylor pretty much keeps to the tone of the first two Cameron movies, so much so that his rendition feels familiar and fresh at the same time. Except for a massive vehicular smash-up on the Golden Gate Bridge that culminates in a school bus dangling over its edge, there are no standout sequences here, but Taylor maintains a brisk pace throughout so you'll never get bored.At this point in the franchise, it is perhaps too tall an order for any filmmaker to reclaim the aura of Cameron's groundbreaking originals, but 'Terminator Genisys' comes the closest of the three sequels since to their spirit. Even if it isn't outstanding, it is a fine piece of popcorn entertainment that is as good an introduction as any to the franchise as much as it will be nostalgia for fans, provided they can accept that the timeline they knew will be no more. And at thirty- one years (or sixty-seven for Schwarzenegger), one could certainly say that the Terminator is old, but as this sequel cum reboot shows, age does not necessarily make one obsolete.",Terminator Genisys
115,quincytheodore,"The operating narrative is sketchy, though new updates and skins of the classics are nice.",6,24 June 2015,"Surprisingly, Terminator Genisys premiers here much sooner than expected. For a blockbuster it certainly has the expected grand action sequences and a sprinkle of humor. It also gives homage to the classic Terminators titles which will be much appreciated by fans. However, the story is all sort of sci-fi mess. Time travel is a tricky premise already, and the movie stacks a bunch of these complex plots on top of one another like pancakes. The result is a very complicated timeline, but hey, it's a stack of pancakes. It wants you to just enjoy it.Without giving much, the first act consists of the earlier Terminators' elements. The use of nostalgia, from the small nifty details to the fight between the famous oldies, is commendably good, Visual cues and the 80s atmosphere are predominant, it's a clear upgrade without ruining its original materials.Problems begin to pile when the movie starts the time jump mumbo jumbo. This might be bearable for sci-fi fans or those familiar with the concept, but casual viewer might be confused. This is not Back to the Future, Interstellar, or even The Flash TV show where there are some sort of explanations. At a few points even the on-screen characters don't know the consequences. The franchise spans over many titles, each with its own plot. Combine all these possibilities with another time altering jump, it gets messy fast.Luckily, acting is pretty good on all board. Arnold Schwarzenegger has been integrated so well into the role, and props to him for taking the brunt of the comedy. His gradually aging persona is unexpectedly effective for warmer Terminator. Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese works fine. He has the soldier look down, and he's expressively determined to complete his mission. Emilia Clarke as younger Sarah Connor is presentable as well. She has some moments, although compared to others who share the same role, she doesn't feel that empowering.Jason Clarke is a bit odd, his role as John Connor is very integral to the franchise and the movie tries to put a spin to the character. Certainly a different John Connor, he's not the usual savior type. J.K. Simmons plays a supporting role here, although the character is not all that crucial and the movie misses the chance for him to slap someone repeatedly. The last notable addition is Byung-hun Lee as T-1000, the liquid cop from Terminator 2. He has only one expression, full assassin mode, but it's a blast seeing him on-screen.Action aficionados would be pleased to see the high octane scenes. Some are inspired by the older titles and they still hold up today, while others are good visual effects and robotic brawls. There are several clever quirks for the action, so it offers more than sheer explosives. Graphical effects such as the Terminator HUD, the characteristic twitches for different Terminators, old and new, are pleasantly crafted.In the end, the battle is down to nostalgia factors and blockbuster glee versus cumbersome plot. I do like the movie and it is enjoyable, but objectively speaking, it could have used more polished story. Audiences want to be entertained, and the twisting narrative can be obtrusive to that cause.",Terminator Genisys
116,fntstcplnt,Terminator: Genisys (2016),4,12 April 2020,"Directed by Alan Taylor. Starring Jai Courtney, Emilia Clarke, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Clarke, J. K. Simmons, Byung-Hun Lee, Dayo Okeniyi, Courtney B. Vance. (R)Once again, John Connor (Clarke) sends back Kyle Reese (Courtney) to protect his mother, Sarah (Clarke), from the T-800 cyborg (Schwarzenegger)...except when he gets there, he finds out that the timeline has been fractured--Sarah is a seasoned warrior instead of an innocent waitress, and multiple Terminators are running around ready to duke it out over the fate of the planet. Attempt to reboot/revitalize the shaky franchise is interesting in concept but foolish in execution. The splintered, overlapping paradoxes are described to near-parodic levels; revisiting several scenes from the original film (echoes of ""Back to the Future Part II"") are often awkward, and just remind how much better the filmmakers were the first time around. Efforts to add irony and tongue-in-cheek references land flat pretty much every time, even turning Sarah and Kyle into bickering rom-com caricatures whenever the pyrotechnics cool down. As for those pyrotechnics, only the battles with Lee's liquid metal monster provide excitement; the rest are ruined by low interest coupled with mediocre direction and effects. Weathered and neutered by weak writing as he may be, it's still nice to see Arnie back in the role that made him an international star.38/100",Terminator Genisys

120,rivertam26,A welcome return to what made the films great to begin with,9,1 July 2015,"I'm confused by the terrible percentage of positive ratings on RT for the latest installment in the Terminator franchise. Now because of the lackluster buzz I may have adjusted my expectations a bit but to say this ambitious, creative film is dull and uneventful is just plain ridiculous. Now any real Terminator fan will tell you the franchise truly ended after the second film. Although the third one was a bit of fun and well Salvation was such an atrocity it doesn't even count. The cleverness and feel of the films was well terminated. Well I'm happy to say this latest addition resurrects it. Not to all of it's past glory of course but it finally puts us in a place where the franchise could once again bloom into something truly relevant. I'm not gonna go into the specifics because I don't want to spoil anything. But the timeline has been sort of reset and because of that the franchise has been reinvigorated in a way so that if you are a terminator fan that potential feels very exciting. Filled with some top notch action sequences and a welcome combination of retro and present day effects wizardry like Jurassic World in that respect the film takes us back to what made the films so engrossing to begin with. Although far from flawless it's a fun wild ride that has much more on it's mind than 99 percent of the movies wide released this year. Schwarzenegger has never been better and Jai Courtney is a solid addition to the cast as Kyle Reese. Emilia Clarke sadly underwhelms as Sarah Connor she never seems to nail the right blend of vulnerability and bad assedness she needs to have. That being said it's hard not to compare her performance with the iconic turn from Linda Hamilton. Although decent she leaves something to be desired. And as for the films execution. it starts off beautifully with the best judgement day and war depiction yet but falters slightly when getting to the films somewhat confusing and ever converging time lines. Honestly, I'm not sure it all made complete sense but I was completely immersed in the story telling and intrigued none the less. I can only hope that people ignore the reviews and give this interpretation a chance so that us fans can be blessed with another outing by all involved. ****.25/5",Terminator Genisys
121,Screen_Blitz,"Terminator: Genisys does not flop, but doesn't reignite the franchise either",5,27 November 2015,"Director Alan Taylor gives a fateful reboot to this once-outstanding franchise that James Cameron started back in 1984, but doesn't quite put the series back on top after the disappointment of the previous two. This film, set in 2029, follows Kyle Reese (played Jai Courtney), a soldier sent back in time to 1984 by Human Resistance leader John Connor (played by Jason Clarke) to protect Sarah Connor against unfamiliar enemies and reset the timeline of the past. Aided by an unfamiliar terminator known as ""The Guardian"" (played by Arnold Schwartznegger), Kyle and Sarah must fight their way through the altered past, in attempt to take down the evil software Skynet that leads to the devastating nuclear war known as ""Judgement Day"" and revive the future of the human race, but face diabolical twists and turns that stand in their way. This film boasted some dazzling special effects, flash visuals, and incredible action sequences, but does it serve justice for the franchise?I watched this film with high expectations despite the negative critical reception. By the end, I was left with mixed feelings. The film has its exciting moments from time to time, and this is said a lot by its fascinating special effects and top-notch visuals served in its high-octane action sequences. The plot on the other hand, leads little to satisfy and signals where this film falters. Overshadowed by its action-savy moments , the plot is very convoluted and uneven that it is almost difficult to follow at times, particularly for those who aren't too familiar with the franchise. The film rehashes a lot of elements from the previous films such as the liquid metal robot T-1000 who was the main nemesis that tried assassinate young John Connor in 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' and familiar one-liners ""I'll be back"" and ""Come with me if you want to live"". Then there is the return of Arnold Schwartznegger who was absent from the previous film 'Terminator: Salvation'. All in all, these just don't really to do much for the film, or did its talented cast. The performances were somewhat okay, nothing too impressive. Overall, the film lacked the depth of the some of the previous films in the franchise and the characters seemed to have tired out from the series.Terminator: Genisys certainly didn't bring James Cameron's series down a level, but it didn't do much redeem it either. This is entertaining in some way and does meet some of my expectations at the least. Overall, this could have been better and sends a clear signal that Jamea Cameron needs to make his return as the director for this series.",Terminator Genisys
122,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Classically awful.,2,26 December 2015,"Terminator Genisys is a bigger joke than you could possibly imagine. It erases ALL the series' past continuity, and all that f***ing of continuity is done all in financial vain, and for the sake of rebooting an unbroken franchise, that didn't need any fixing in the first place!Genisys is just as bad as the typo in its own title. And what a deserving title this is. It admits that it can't even strive to reach the achievement James Cameron made with the first two movies. With that said, I'm surprised Cameron liked the movie, if that is to be believed.This is the incarnate of Hollywood cynicism at its absolute worst: a capable director given a script written by television comedy screenwriters, and no supervision by the creator OR an established film producer who knows when enough is enough.The plot is this: John Connor is now the bad guy, thanks to Matt Smith being a Terminator who changes all the history of the franchise. And what follows is a fan-fiction quality level mess that shoves WAY too much fan service into the viewer's face. And the story is basically a point A to point B to turn Arnie into the liquid Terminator from Judgement Day. That's ... IT!!What a classic disaster. Typos in movie titles do not bode well for movies.",Terminator Genisys
123,Troy_Campbell,"Moderately fun, but doesn't stand out in the 2015 blockbuster season.",6,1 July 2015,"Much like Jurassic World last month, judging this reboot against the classics of the franchise (both T1 and T2) is utterly redundant. But does Genisys stand out in the crowded blockbuster season of 2015? Not particularly, however it still serves as a diverting piece of cinematic escapism with a few noteworthy elements to make it recommendable. Director Alan Taylor (Thor 2) knows a thing or two about action and, due to the jumping narrative timeline, gets to unleash an array of melees (all with top notch CGI) set in the 80's, basically-present day, and the apocalyptic future. Some work better than others. The first act showdown with a T-1000 is exciting and playful, whilst the climactic battle against a new form of Terminator displays some ingenuity. On the flip side there's a helicopter chase that is entirely bland and unwarranted, and a Golden Gate Bridge set piece that's not as thrilling as it could have been. Taylor and his writing team wisely settle on a tone somewhere between the overly jokey T3 and the pretentiously serious Salvation; they land a few key gags without overdoing it. Yet in their attempt to restart the series – without excluding anything that has come before, a la J.J. Abrams' Star Trek – they have crafted a ludicrously convoluted story rife with internal logic issues. Arnie returns to the mix with a much better performance than what he gave in T3, whilst Emilia Clarke is solid as the badass Sarah Connor and Jason Clarke impresses as a more mysterious John Connor. Conversely, Jai Courtney's intense turn as Kyle Reese is a tad overcooked and J.K. Simmons rocks up in a superfluous minor role that wastes his immense talent. An 80's-era Arnie also gets a look in with a couple of fights in the opening act which, although not mind-blowing, demonstrate just how close we are to completely photo-realistic computer generated humans. Genisys is likely to be a disappointment to hard-core Terminator enthusiasts, but there's just enough here to please the more casual cinemagoer.",Terminator Genisys
124,antoniotierno,Not the best among the sequels but decent and well acted,7,14 July 2015,"Director Alan Taylor and writers Laeta Kalogridis have rebooted the original franchise, carefully incorporating pieces of all the films and TV series since James Cameron's 1984 original, ironing out any conflicts by deploying that trusty old science fiction standby, time- travel paradox. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back, of course—it would hardly be a Terminator movie without his presence—adding a notable touch of self-mockery (the fact that this ""robot"" has aged 30 years is deftly explained away). Under Taylor's briskly over- the-top direction, the movie is good fun, though not simplified (if not complicated) and not always logical. The real secret weapon here isn't time machines or robots, it's Emilia Clarke (of Game of Thrones) as Sarah Conner, tender and forceful as needed in a potentially star-making acting performance.",Terminator Genisys
125,ketgup83,Old but not obsolete. Arnie is definitely back !!!,7,4 July 2015,"Way back in 1984, James Cameron created The Terminator franchises which was adored followed by highly critical and respectable Terminator 2. Subsequent follow ups could not live up to the expectations which raised a question whether Terminator Genisys will bring back its lost glory ? Well, it managed to raise the bar with few shorting comings.To protect Sarah Conor(Emily Clarke), John Connor( Jason Clarke) sends Sgt. Kyle Reese( Jai Courtney) back to the past. However, the past has been reset and Kyle lands himself in an unexpected turns of events when he, Sarah and the Guardian ( Arnold Schwarzenegger) must fight to stop the judgement day.Sky-high expectations from Alan Taylor, previously credited with Thor:The Dark World, will disappoint you as the amateur director spoils the direction with loose screenplay. However, if you are fan of the Termanitor series, you will enjoy the ride. The opening scene, the clash between old and the new Arnold is eye-catching. T-1000 metal liquid car chase and subsequent fight scene is applauding. The moment they time-travel to the future, the screenplay becomes haywire. The story becomes complicated and will complex you. It is here an experienced would have handled the script better. The hospital scene was wafer-thin and wasting excellent actor like J.K.Simmons. The silver-lining is the beautifully shot climax scene in the Cyberdine System. Visual effects were impressive and action sequence on the Golden Gate bridge was the highlight of the film. Editing could have been better. Art direction and cinematography were amazing. Dialogues were nice. Emily Clarke was certainly no better as Sarah Connor. She should work on her expression. Jason Clarke as John Cnnor was nice. Jai as Kyle was impressive. Coming to the man of the moment- Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Termanitor series is incomplete without him. The actor, as usual, has less dialogue delivery but is expressive and impressive with his acting skills.Overall, as a fan of the Terminator, it was good entertainment. Good 3/5",Terminator Genisys

128,Stephen_A_Abell,Not As Good As The Original But Better Than Expected.,8,11 April 2017,"Yet another Terminator time-travelling yarn. This time, because of previous alterations in the past, when this new timeline's John Connor sends Kyle Reese back to save his mother and himself from Skynet he is attacked by an unknown assailant. Kyle see's this and as he passes back through time he catches some strange images of his younger self.One of the reasons I loved this movie was the superb homage to the original by recreating some of the opening segments; this was a brave and daring move by the writers Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier, and director Alan Taylor. This could have gone so wrong... but it was so right. Even more so, because the humour that appeared in T2 and was missing in the first as it was played more seriously, is here in these recreated scenes.When Reese lands in this timeline he finds that the Terminator he is following is not the only one on the hunt for Sarah Connor. From here on it's a race, not to shut down Skynet as that never come to fruition, but the Skynet AI, which has only been delayed and is now branded as Genisys. A total package app that will allow users to have control over all their gadgets... as will the AI. This AI will bring on a nuclear devastation as well as give birth to the Terminators.However, all of this leads to some paradoxes, one of which I really loved, though I couldn't really bring myself to believe it was actually an option. I don't like spoilers so I won't say anything else, though you'll spot it when it happens.The special effects are, as always, brilliant and larger than life. Taylor does a great job of keeping the pace going throughout the film, right from the tribute at the beginning to the reveal at the climax.Arnie Schwarzenegger is still the Terminator and it was great to see him back in the role, both real and CGI'd. He brings a nice joyful feel to the character, which is strange saying he's playing an android. This humour was added in T2 and worked really well, now he feels as though he's part of the family. A Terminator film isn't a Terminator film without Arnie. Now they have his CGI image he can keep appearing forever.However, though Emilia Clarke, did a nice job as Sarah Connor I still preferred Linda Hamilton's strong single-minded character in T2.I also wasn't too keen on this film's John Connor, played by Jason Clarke, or Kyle Reese, played by Jai Courtney. Maybe because the original film had such an impact when I first saw it. Michael Biehn was a much better Reese and I could believe the sexual chemistry between him and Sarah... that chemistry is lacking in this film - John Connor may never be born. Even John Connor's character isn't without flaws, he doesn't appear to be from Sarah's loins or even a ""super"" soldier created from her extensive training after his birth.These slight issues could be down to the writer, director, or actor. However, it doesn't stop the movie from being good fun... and giving plenty of scope for a sequel.If you enjoy The Terminator films then you will like this one. I would recommend you to give this a viewing, at least once. If you've not watched a single Terminator film then don't start here, go back to the original, you won't be disappointed.",Terminator Genisys

Where this lacks is when the movie itself tries to recruit our help in helping it make sense. The problem is that with all time travel plots, there is already quite a lot to take in and consider let alone creating too many stories, twists and turns. If one tries to learn this movie instead of watching it, it leads to head hurt rather quickly. This can easily be dealt with by letting go of your past pleasant memories of Cameron at the helm and accept new leadership and direction. On Arnold and his age and trying to make an action star come alive by ignoring what we see and accepting what we are told is too much work for a movie viewer to have to endure.

I mean,, Alan Taylor is good (I enjoyed GoT, and Thor 2). That being said,,,The movie starts off in the future, and we hear Kyle Reese talking about the war with Skynet and how John Connor is leading the humans to defeat the machines. Making a long story shorter,, they win the war, but Skynet has already sent the Terminator back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor,, so John asks for a volunteer to go and protect her. Kyle, of course, volunteers immediately, and as he is being sent back he sees a Terminator latch on to John. Kyle reaches out, but it's already too late. He lands (literally) in 1984.
The next few mins happens pretty much the same as the first movie,, except Reese gets caught by two cops while evading a different Terminator (not Arnold version). One cop is killed by said Terminator, and has the other Cop and Reese trapped in a retail store. Otb,, an armored car crashes into the store and knocks the Terminator out of commission, momentarily. The door flies open,, and to Reese's surprise the driver turns out to be Sarah Connor,,, who says the famous line, ""Come with me if you wanna live."" If you want to know more,, well see the film,,,Spoilers ahead if you haven't seen it.Now,, there was so much about this movie that I thought was great. Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor? Are u kidding me? She was perfect!! I thought Jai Courtney was a great choice to play Kyle Reese. Jason Clarke was also a good choice to play John. Arnold,,, well,, he IS the Terminator!! Lol,,, I also really liked J.K. Simmons character and contribution to the film. I thought the cast really worked well together.Now,, the idea of Kyle and Sarah going to the future and then John showing up as a hybrid Terminator? It's not that the idea can't work,, I just don't think that it works as anything OTHER than an alternate version in a different universe. I don't think this film works with continuing the story after Terminators 1, 2, and 3 (of course 3 has been changed now bc of Dark Fate,, but still). Imo,, the story works as the following - Terminator 1, then 2, then 3, then Terminator Salvation,,, or Terminator 1, then 2, then Dark Fate. Imo,, Terminator Genisys is a different universe.

132,one9eighty,Obsolete - please terminate,5,15 June 2020,"Bear with me and I'll try and get this right.... John Connor sends Kyle Reese back to the past to protect the future, but when he gets there it's not the past he was expecting to go back to, but a different past that isn't the past that he went through. He meets Sarah Connor who already knows who he is and is accompanied by a T-800 Terminator. Don't be alarmed though, this is a good Terminator that was sent to protect her when she was 9 years old, from a bad Terminator, which Kyle would have know if it was the past that he should have lived, but didn't. Kyle doesn't know any of this because it's a different timeline than the one he's come back in time from. Because of the timeline criss-crossing Kyle is experiencing visions and feelings of a time that he hasn't lived, but should have if time had been different, which it wasn't for him. Sarah already has a plan to save the future by travelling to the future to save the distant future, but Kyle argues that rather than that future, they travel to a different distant future to save the far distant future - is this all clear? Oh yes, and John Connor comes back from the future to the past, which is a future that is new to Kyle, to kill them all, because he's not really John Connor, but is.While the previous film, ""Terminator: Salvation"", looked to be exploring a new and exciting route for the franchise, this film falls back into old habits. Like a comfortable pair of slippers, this film dons on a lot of the cliches, one liners and time travelling antics that you would expect to find from other films in the franchise. The only problem is that the other films (barring ""Terminator 3"") already did them, did them really well, and were original in doing them really well. To see these kind of things here it's like a parody of itself, or like the director wanted to add Terminator Easter eggs, without actually adding them properly. In fact it's more a kin to a rehash than a parody. To give an example, how many times in a franchise can you hear ""Come with me if you want to live"", or ""I'll be back""? Just lazy. How many times can you see Arnie's Terminator character get beaten to death only to mysterious come from nowhere to save the day again.I didn't particularly fall in love with the casting in this film I'm afraid. I've seen all the central characters in other films giving better, more believable performances. In my opinion, this ensemble was probably the worst group I've seen acting those characters. If I put my mind to it and think of all the Terminator on-screen performances, I can easily give a better adaption of the character than appeared in this film. They weren't awful by any stretch, but they weren't engaging and authentic either.The action was decent, but wasn't anything breathtaking or new. I'm afraid it's pretty much all been done before and this film just rehashed rather than innovated. I was not surprised by anything, and nothing amazed me (God, I'm beginning to sound like an emotionless robot now!?!)The plot was all over the place and actually hurts to understand if you actually sit down and try to map it out. It was a case of style over substance, which makes the director and writers come across as lazy, almost like they are just milking the franchise by not doing anything new or exciting with it. Pity.I really wanted to like this film, but after watching it numerous times now though, it actually starts to make ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" more credible - and that really is saying something. It hurts me to award a low rating because of how amazing the first two films in the franchise were, but the best I can do is give this a 5 out of 10. To put that into context, the first Terminator gets 10/10 from me - this 5th film in series is half the film the first one was - sad times :(",Terminator Genisys

Terminator Genisys is the best Terminator film since Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). This doesn't mean that it's great. But it is the most enjoyable and most consistent Terminator film since 1991. Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003) and Terminator Salvation (2009) are remembered for their action scenes and little else. Terminator Genisys, on the other hand, stays solid from beginning to end. The marketing campaign for this big budget science fiction action film has been problematic. The trailers weren't really impressive, and the last trailer revealed a part of the plot that should have been kept secret until the film's release. I only like some of the promotional posters. Another thing that seemed strange is the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger (who's 67 years old now) as a T-800 Terminator. Why would an old man play a Terminator? Fortunately, Schwarzenegger's age isn't a problem in the film. His return is welcome by me. He also delivers one of the best performances. Another good performance is by Jason Clarke, who plays leader of the human resistance John Connor. What Clarke does in this film is much better than Christian Bale's bland performance as Connor. I won't even complain about the acting because Jai Courtney (Kyle Reese) and Emilia Clarke (Sarah Connor) are fine as well. They do the best with the dialogue that they've been given. The film's biggest problem is the screenplay by Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier. It's by no means a wreck, but it's sometimes formulaic, unoriginal and poorly written. Perhaps there are even a few plot holes present. It's one of those things that people have come to expect from Hollywood films these days - a screenplay with poorly written characters. It was written with profits in mind. Still, there are a few good ideas in it, and it provides some good character interactions. When it comes to the characters, what works for me is the relation between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese and the relation between Sarah Connor and Guardian. These are characters that one grows to like in the course of the film. So, even with the problematic screenplay, no one can really say that they hate Courtney, Clarke and Schwarzenegger in this film. There's a good amount of humor in Terminator Genisys. The film also has a lighter and brighter tone than its gritty and dark predecessors. This is something that I definitely enjoyed because the ending has an optimistic note. By the end, you want these characters to succeed. When it comes to how the film was scored, I can say that Lorne Balfe's music is the best since Brad Fiedel's score for Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Balfe's score isn't full of memorable themes, but this is definitely above average film scoring, with several pleasing tracks. I recommend buying or downloading the score. The biggest draw is, of course, the action. There's nothing here that we haven't seen before, but the film is action-packed nonetheless. The young audience will especially enjoy the robot vs. robot fights. Terminator Genisys has a PG rating, so there's nothing in the action that will offend people. This is what brings me to what mostly upset some fans of James Cameron's Terminator films. Because the filmmakers wanted this film to be family-friendly, they made it like a typical inoffensive summer blockbuster. But, in my opinion, this criticism has been harsh. It's been 30 years since the first Terminator film. One simply can't expect Hollywood to deliver something like James Cameron's effort again. Well, Cameron himself made Titanic (1997) and Avatar (2009) since then, two films that not many people enjoy watching. So, do I recommend Terminator Genisys? Yes, I definitely recommend it. The 2014 remake of RoboCop, for example, really disappointed me, but this reboot of the Terminator franchise made me want to see Terminator Genisys again after it ended.",Terminator Genisys
135,RforFilm,"Despite some good performances and Terminator Geniys's interesting way to continue the franchise, it's time to say ""Hasta la Vista"" to the franchise",5,2 July 2015,"2015 is the summer of the robot! We've had Ex Machina, Tomorrowland, and The Avengers: Age of Ultron which all had some from of robotics playing a huge part of the story. The inclusion of these machines are probably the easiest way to get a mainstream audience interested in science fiction without having to make the story way too fused with the genre. Not to mention that when they can take robots and cross them into other genres, then it shows that Hollywood studios are at least trying to do something different. Once such franchise is The Terminator series. In 1984, James Cameron created The Terminator, which took elements of action, thriller and even a little horror to create a compelling story about a machine from the future going after a woman that would later become the mother of John Conner, savior of the future. A lot of this had to do with the casting of then unknown Arnold Schwarzenegger as the intimidating terminator. In 1991, Cameron returned to the series with Terminator 2: Judgment Day; it was bigger, more compelling and all around one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time. But once Cameron left, the other movies have failed to reach the same heights and have threatened to terminate the franchise. Terminator Genisys is both a sequel to the first two and a reboot. In 2029, John Conner (played by Jason Clarke) is the leader of the resistance where he and Kyle Reese (played by Jai Courtney) are leading an attack on Skynet against the machines. They make it into the core, but are too late from stopping Skynet from sending a T-800 back in time to kill Sarah Conner (the same from the first movie). Conner decides to send Kyle back to save Sarah, but moments before he's sent back, Kyle witnesses a machine attacking Conner.Now in 1984, Kyle finds a different Sarah Conner (played by Emilia Clarke) then he was told to expect; instead of an innocent waitress, he finds a trained warrior whose already been made aware of judgment day and the machines. The time line was alerted when another T- 800 (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent to protect her as a child. The reveal that they've already taken care of the bad terminator and they will continue to stop Skynet. Through newly acquired memories from the new time line, Kyle reveals that judgment day is now in 2017. Sarah and Kyle are sent there by another time machine where they hope to work with an aged terminator to prevent judgment day from happening. Terminator Genisys is certainly an ambitious story, attempting to wipe away the slate clean while keeping it's roots from the earlier movies. The final effect leads to a movie that had my head spinning, trying to figure out the new time line. It's not the most confusing, but it seems like that they story doesn't care about time paradoxes and conflictions.As far as the acting is concerned, it's descent. I finally found a movie that Jai Courtney's tolerable in, even though he doesn't look like the original actor. Emilia Clarke makes for a good Sarah Conner, being both as tough as Linda Hamilton was in the second movie. Schwarzenegger is always fun to see as the stone face robot. It's not surprising, but it's fun. What is lacking is the action and emotional story. I'm not seeing much of an evolution of character as they are more or less, running from one location to another to stop Skynet, which is an unfortunate retread of the second movie. The action itself is standard blockbuster action, nothing bad, but nowhere near the level that James Cameron brought before.I'll give this three T-800s out of five. If you look at Terminator Genisys on it's own, it's more or less likely something you'd watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon at the most. But as a part of the once grand franchise, perhaps we should terminate this before it's too late.",Terminator Genisys
136,ivo-cobra8,The Worst awful Terminator film I have ever watched. Been a Terminator fan my whole life since my childhood and we get this?,1,9 August 2015,"None of the Terminator films are so bad than the new Terminator: Genisys film is.I really had a high hopes for this movie that it will beat and redeem the third movie sadly it didn't. This movie really disappointed me. They made this movie that T1 and T2 does not exist anymore. T-101 was shot into a heart from a 12.year old school girl. Than in the tunnel T101 awakes him self's and than he is shot to death with a shotgun from Kyle his head get's blown off. In the original Terminator T-101 was shot in the eye from Kyle Reese and he crashed with a police car in the wall and he still lived. In this movie he was killed. T-1000 Asian cop was killed over 20.minutes. Now John Connor is T-3000? A liquid metal now or whatever.Schwarzenegger criticized and bashed Terminator: Salvation with how it sucked. Well Arnold your movie isn't even close better than Salvation is,it is the worst Science Fiction/Action film I have ever seen. And this, is coming from a Terminator fan. I am not buying your movie, this film is not getting even close to my Blu-ray collection! This movie is a disgrace and Arnold you should be ashamed of your self. Not only that, you could apologize for insulting Christian Bale! No wait you want do that. And I don't want to see your new Conan film Arnold! Was this a wannabe comedy or a terminator movie?. Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese was the worst at acting in the movie I have seen. Michael Biehn was so much better actor than Jai Courtney is. Jai Courtney screw up A Good Day to Die Hard (2013) and now he screwed up a Terminator film. John Connor played now from Jason Clarke that dude from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) it is now some weird combination of human/none/ technology/robot/liquid metal that is so far out there that it is stupid. Yes, stupid. The new Sarah is awful, Emilia Clarke is the worst Sarah, I have ever seen in this movie. Linda Hamilton was so much better she could kick Emilia Clarke's ass. Lena Headey was even more bad ass in the TV series playing Sarah than Emilia portrayed her in this movie. The Terminator now is called Pops not a Terminator or T-800 ""POPS""! Now he is a father figure to Sarah. Say What? and competes with Kyle for his ""daughter's"" approval. He awkwardly smiles a lot and repeats the same punch lines over and over as if we didn't get it the first 6 times. It is border line offensive to average human intelligence. Add to that ridiculous scenes like the helicopter chase towards the end which defies logic and I am ready to question anyone's intelligence who rates this movie as anything above a joke. Some people say ""it was a fun summer flick, lighten up and just enjoy it for the action"". What action? The crap CGI all over and helicopters from star wars? The T800s looked better in the originals. I wanted to enjoy it and went in with an open mind not expecting much but I wasn't prepared for what I actually witnessed. It was the worst summer flick I have ever seen that has actually insulted me for wanting to watch it. (if that's even possible) It was a joke and a mockery at best. It can't be taken seriously even if you wanted to. It fails at being a terminator movie. It fails at being a ""true sequel to T1&T2"". It fails at being funny. It fails at having ground breaking CGI. If fails at having a story. It fails at character development. It fails at having good sound effects. The music is TERRIBLE! It even destroys the prequels time lines which I don't care for really if it was good. It has nothing going for it. The Terminator second best favorite Science Fiction/Action classic film in the franchise. I rate 9.5/10.Terminator 2: Judgment Day is the best Epic Sci-Fi Classic Action Movie of all times and one of my favorite best action sci-fi flicks that I love to death. I rate 10/10.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was a good decent Action/Sci-Fi flick. It was good acting from Kristanna Loken. The Action, Cgi and fights between Kristanna Loken and Schwarzenegger were awesome. Ending was also good and we finally see Judgement Day. The movie was rated R. I rate 7/10.Terminator: Salvation was good once you got passed Bale's Batman voice. At least it was getting into the future war and heading the right direction after T3. No fancy robots, just cold steel cyborgs with one acceptable twist (Marcus). The T600 was awesome. I rate 7/10.I rate this movie 1/10",Terminator Genisys
137,bankofmarquis,Arnold's still got it,7,19 July 2015,"I always try to judge a film on it's own merits and not on what I was hearing about it before I saw it. I struggled at this with TERMINATOR GENISYS for I had heard about how it is an ""unnecessary"" addition to the Terminator franchise and that Arnold is a bit long in the tooth to play this role. I only ended up seeing it when I was running late to the movie I wanted to see and ""settled"" for this one.And, boy, am I glad I settled.I had a ""private screening"" of TG last Friday as I was the ONLY person in the movie theater (that can't be a good sign, right?). So I hunkered down and took this movie on it's own merits.TG is a time travel movie that resets the timeline (much like Star Trek's reboot a few years ago). This is necessary for the Terminator franchise is heavy in entrenched future history that really restricts the filmmakers and the characters (if you need proof of this, see TERMINATOR: RISE OF THE MACHINES).I took the Basil Exposition approach to this time travel - ""I suggest you not think about it too much and just sit back and enjoy it"" - and this worked marvelously. I'm sure if I thought about it too much, I could poke many, many holes in this.But I didn't and I enjoyed myself greatly. Jai Courtney is our hero, Kyle Reese who is sent back in time to protect Sarah Connor (Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke). Only Reese finds out she doesn't need protecting for she has been under the care of a Terminator (Arnold, of course) programmed to protect her. It is Reese that, for the most part, needs protecting and the dynamic between the three is good enough to be entertained by it.The action is decent (if not spectacular) and I did not feel overwhelmed by the special effects (a good sign). This movie rises or falls on how well you accept Arnold in the Terminator role. For me, it was like finding an old, comfortable t- shirt at the bottom of the drawer. You put it on, and while it doesn't fit as well and is not nearly as comfortable as you remember it to be, there is so much good and positive emotions built up from years earlier that you easily fall back into old habits and forgive it it's age and not perfect fit.That's a long way to say that I enjoyed Arnold's performance and think that - all things considered - he's still got it.The unsuspecting highlight for me in this film was the surprise appearance of the GREAT J.K. Simmons. The recent Academy Award recipient finds just the right tone in the aging, alcoholic cop who quickly learns - and accepts - what is going on. He looks like he's having fun and I had fun watching him.On the other side of the coin, Jason Clarke - as the iconic John Connor - looks like he is having no fun at all. I'm not a big fan of Mr. Clarke's work. I find him a bit too one-dimensional for my tastes. It's a bad sign that when he shows up on screen, I think ""oh...him"" (inflection down) as opposed to when I saw Simmons appear and thought ""oh, him!"" (inflection up).I also don't like that the filmmakers felt the need to give Skynet a personality (though an interesting one in former Dr. Who Matt Smith). I get the thought behind it, Skynet is the chief antagonist, so the filmmakers thought it would be better to have the antagonist have a personality. I would have preferred that it didn't.Is this a perfect movie? Heck no. The plot holes are too numerous to mention, the chase scenes went on just a little too long and the open ended conclusion (leaving the door open for the inevitable sequel) was unsatisfying.But I enjoyed my private screening of this movie nonetheless. Grab your popcorn, check your cynicism at the door and you, too, will have a good time with this film.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Terminator Genisys
138,Anurag-Shetty,Successfully reintroduces The Terminator franchise to a new generation.,8,7 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys is a reboot of The Terminator movies. After a cataclysmic global disaster known as Judgment Day, most of humanity has been wiped out. The survivors now live in fear of an organization known as Skynet, which consists of terrifying killer robots. By 2029, an organization called the Resistance led by John Connor(Jason Clarke), have been actively fighting Skynet for many years. However, Skynet comes up with a plan to safeguard its existence. Sending a Terminator back in time to 1984, to kill Sarah Connor(Emilia Clarke) to prevent John from ever being born. John sends his most faithful ally Kyle Reese(Jai Courtney), back in time to protect Sarah at any cost. However, the situation in 1984 is nothing like John described it, due to the presence of Guardian(Arnold Schwarzenegger). Terminator Genisys is an excellent film! I have to be honest with you. I haven't watched any of the previous Terminator movies so, maybe those are way better(especially the James Cameron movies). I decided to watch this since it's a reboot of the Terminator franchise. I'm completely blown away! I can't believe I waited this long to watch a Terminator film. The special effects are otherworldly. The chase & action sequences are extremely thrilling & look superb in 3D. The Golden Gate Bridge set piece is worth the ticket price alone. The fight between Guardian & T-800 is amazing. Who wouldn't love to see Arnold Schwarzenegger vs. Arnold Schwarzenegger! Despite the brilliant special effects this movie becomes perfect due to the performances. Arnold Schwarzenegger is outstanding as Guardian. Schwarzenegger is truly ""back"" with a bang in one of his most iconic roles. Guardian's awkwardness when dealing with humans' various emotions is hilarious. Jason Clarke is great as John Connor. Emilia Clarke is spectacular as Sarah Conner. I loved seeing Clarke playing a total bad-ass like Sarah who is a far cry from her prim & proper role of Daenerys Targaryen on Game of Thrones. Jai Courtney is awesome as Kyle Reese. J.K. Simmons is hilarious as O'Brien. Matt Smith is excellent as Alex. Byung-hun Lee is impressive as Cop/T-1000. The supporting characters are effective as well. Terminator Genisys is a must watch for die hard fans & newcomers alike.",Terminator Genisys
139,fernandoschiavi,"Full of flaws and without originality, the excess of new information that confuses the story to the point that the characters have to explain all the time about time travel",6,23 May 2020,"After the franchise's last film shows life in the future in the midst of human war with machines, Genesis' turn comes to try to breathe a new breath into the series of films. Genesis arrives like a little of the three, trying to offer a new breath of life for this saga of Sarah and John Connor, trying to rescue concepts used mainly in Terminator and The Final Judgment and merging its iconic elements in order to create a hybrid that brings the franchise to today's standards. restart the franchise with a mix of reboot, remake, prequel and sequel within a single film. Unfortunately, not everything works.In 2029, human resistance against machines is led by John Connor (Jason Clarke). Upon learning that Skynet sent an exterminator into the past with the aim of killing his mother, Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), before his birth, John sends Sergeant Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to 1984, intending to ensure her safety. However, when Reese arrives he is surprised by the fact that Sarah is guarded by another T-800 exterminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), sent to protect her when she was a child.Genesis, therefore, right in its initial third brings an emblematic change within everything that was presented in its predecessors: it is a new beginning (as the title itself makes quite clear) and, above all, a new possibility for the future. In terms of concepts, the film manages to rescue tones very similar to those used in the first two films - the sense of urgency is maintained through different fronts, engaging the viewer in something more than a simple visual spectacle. The beginning of the film is promising and provides an incredible fan service, playing with the timeline of the franchise in what appears, in fact, to be a tribute to the original, beginning with decisive moments of the war against Skynet in the future, at the exact moment when that the machines lose a battle to humans and send the cyborg T-800 to Los Angeles in 1984 as a last resort. Meanwhile, the Resistance commanded by John Connor sends Sergeant Kyle Reese, who is actually his father, for the same time. So far, the film is exciting to show the mixture with the passages of the original film, practically copied frame by frame of the James Cameron film. It was amazing to see the arrival of the T-800 and Kyle Reese exactly as it did in the original again. The tributes work very well, even with a great re-creation of the scenarios and costumes of the 1984 film, and the story even gets excited due to the nostalgia provoked in the viewer, but when entering its second act, where the action begins to develop and the script starts its biggest plot twists, everything starts to go wrong.Instead of meeting a helpless Sarah Connor in front of a murderous cyborg, he meets an armed warrior to the teeth in the company of a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger, returning to the role he has not played since Terminator 3 (2003) And the surprise doesn't stop there: almost at the same time, a model T-1000 exterminator (Lee Byung-hun) also appears with the mission of exterminating everyone, a very different past from what John Connor had told and which makes Kyle - as well as the entire audience - get completely confused. And to add to the confusion, Sarah tells Kyle that an exterminator was sent in 1973 to protect her after her parents' death and plans to travel in 1997, in a time machine built by ""Papi"", to destroy the Cyberdine company, which created Skynet, however, Kyle tells Sarah to instead go to 2017, because during his time travel he had a vision of himself when child n- with a system called Genesis, which will make Skynet control the entire planet. They go to 2017 and there they find their son John who works on his own time machine at Cyberdine and who was turned into an exterminator, called T-3000, by Skynet.
The script by Laeta Kalogridis, Patrick Lussier forces the audience to readjust their expectations in the face of what they thought they already knew about that universe, this revelation is intriguing and promising: how did the other Terminator become Sarah's protector? Who sent you? And under what circumstances? What are your guidelines? Could it reveal the full role of Cyberdyne Systems in the future of humanity? Could Sarah get Miles Dyson? In fact, if Cyberdyne started to develop Skynet when it discovered the arm of the original Terminator and it no longer exists, would this already prevent the existence of the project? Unfortunately, no matter how relevant these issues are, the film decides to simply ignore them, contenting itself with showing the T-800 by rescuing Sarah from the new villain and judging, from then on, that nothing else matters. Instead, he prefers to bet on twists and turns that usually involve someone saying something like ""I was sent for the year ..."" and that result in more questions that can ruin the previous ones without even answering them. Genesis seems to believe that the supposedly complex plot replaces the need to better develop the characters, who end up presenting themselves as unidimensional and uninteresting figures.Evidently, the text's biggest problem is getting lost when telling the story, after all it deals with time travel. With this extremely complex theme, it is normal to contradict the narrative line and destroy the already weakened logic of the series. Unfortunately, without escaping this curse, Genesis fails here. ""Genesis"" starts to go wrong when it mixes these two possibilities as it suits, generating several moments where nothing makes much sense, because the concepts start to cancel each other out. Thus, a festival of random events begins that slowly spoils the film. The film never shows the same concern for sounding plausible when developing the plot itself, as at one point, a character even goes so far as to say that killing Sarah and / or Kyle before they conceive John Connor wouldn't make any difference in the timeline - a stupid resource for the viewer to fear for the fate of the characters even though they have not yet had the opportunity to produce the savior of humanity. In addition, ""Genesis"" introduces a countdown to highlight the tension just to make it irrelevant at the climax, when time passes in a random fashion.It is important to highlight the good work in the direction of Alan Taylor, responsible for ""Thor: The Dark World"" and some episodes of the ""Game of Thrones"" series. Doing what was possible with the script he was offered and he does very well in recreating the scenes from the original film and in all the action scenes, explosions, chases etc. The visual effects are excellent and the current technology allows you to do the technical juggling that was previously done manually in the first two classics of the series. The director and team treat the original work with a lot of respect - at least as far as the image is concerned. The sequences that pass in the apocalyptic future and in 1984 are very faithful to the visual conception of James Cameron in his original feature. These scenes were even filmed on film, which guarantees a unique, nostalgic look. In addition, director of photography, Kramer Morgenthau used lighting techniques and planning characteristic of the 1980s - grainy image, unique points of light to illuminate the third plane, fog, strobe lights, high backlight and hard light for the key light. It is a spectacle of nostalgia.In the cast, Emilia Clarke, like the new Sarah Connor, effectively manages to embody the iconic warrior. In addition to having a slight physical resemblance to Linda Hamilton, the original Sarah Connor, she convinces as the anti-machine guerrilla with a strong personality. Schwarzenegger is great in the character that enshrined him, bringing that same expressionlessness of the previous films, but adding some new nuances to the character, showing everything he learned by spending so much time with young Sarah. Of course, we still have all your catchphrases present, jokes that could not be missing. The duo is the film's great comic streak, making it a lot funnier than the others in the franchise, which turns out to be no bad thing. Jai Courtney, however, does not shy away from the typical action movie hero, bringing nothing new to the franchise. J.K. Simmons plays a police officer who could have been completely cut from the script, making his appearance sound like yet another marketing ploy due to the success of ""Whiplash"". The only one that really draws our attention (besides Schwarzenegger) is John Connor himself, played by Jason Clarke, who guarantees greater depth to the character, but I can't say any more so as not to spoil surprises within the work.""Genesis"" is a work that ultimately adds nothing. It does criticize today's society, the ""stay connected"" that dominates our lives, but it does so in a superficial way, sounding more like a convenient use of today in order to reach more viewers. The excess of new information that confuses the story to the point that the characters have to explain all the time about time travel, alternative reality, etc. This new information not only messed up but distorted the original script and idea created by director and screenwriter James Cameron. With a plot full of flaws and without originality, it is so generic that it easily mixes with the countless action films released every year. Unfortunately, the film simply does not justify its existence within the mythology of these films and fails to explore its main novelty - John Connor.",Terminator Genisys

It made the careers of some household names, and pushed the boundaries of special effects, all with a good storyline.This sequel feels like the nadir. It truly is poor and I can't see how the script was given the green light, it's almost as if they had run out of ideas. Cramming in lots of homages to the first two movies (whilst skipping the last two) is their only hope it seemed but really becomes overblown and overdone.Arnie seems out of place and faxed in his place in this film. Our two other main leads aren't actually bad, but hampered by a poor poor script. Nothing they can do.It's not worth going on too much more about this. It was simply awful and a disappointment.

After a span of twelve years, the third installment Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines was released directed by Jonathan Mostow. This raised some eyebrows as the Terminator films were seen as a James Cameron franchise. Ideally James Cameron created The Terminator, and he should finish off the film.However the Terminator part 3 lived up to the fans expectations and did well commercially. Terminator Salvation, the fourth film in the series, was directed by yet another different director Joseph McGinty Nichol(McG). Terminator Salvation was criticized as having the weakest of all the Terminator plots and was a moderate performer at the Box Office. On to the latest film Terminator Genisys. It can be considered as a direct sequel to the events after Terminator 3. The nuclear holocaust has occurred and humanity is on the verge of extinction. From the brink of defeat, John Connor leads a final assault on Skynet, an artificial general intelligence system seeking to eliminate the human race. Before the Resistance wins the offensive, Skynet activates a time machine and sends back a T-800 Terminator to 1984 to kill John's mother, Sarah Connor. John's right-hand man, Kyle Reese, volunteers to travel back in time to protect her. Watch the film to see what happens next...Verdict: these days, overuse of C.G.I. is becoming a nuisance. The pacing of such movies suffers as a result. Films of this sort try to pile a lot of special effects on the screen at one time. This is more then the viewer can handle. Also no one pays any attention to the script. The casting is no better. Emilia Clarke is unsuited to the role of Sarah Connor which Linda Hamilton portrayed. Also Kyle Reese portrayed by Jason Clarke is the shell of character that was once excellent portrayed by actor Michael Biehn in The Terminator.The only consolation is that Arnold Schwarzenegger is still the Terminator Model 101. However with age, his acting has suffered. Possibly this could be his last Terminator film. I am still in a state of disbelief as to why James Cameron did not direct this as a closing chapter to the Terminator franchise.More Robot Films: D.A.R.Y.L.(1985),Deadly Friend(1986), Death Machine (1994), Hardware (1990), Project Shadowchaser(1992 has 2 sequels), Nemesis (1992 has 3 sequels), Class of 1999 II: The Substitute(1994), Short Circuit 1&2 (1986,1988) Programmed to Kill (1987), Evolver(1995), Hands of Steel (1986), Eve of Destruction (1991), Cyborg Cop (1993).

144,bob-the-movie-man,Old...but not obsolete,6,3 July 2015,"The Terminator is back, older, wiser and post Governorship. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns – against all the odds – to the role that made him famous (no, not Conan – the other one). And a fun time he has with it too.Forget ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Forget ""Terminator: Salvation"" (and Lord knows I've tried). This film intelligently and sensibly picks up the story after James Cameron's groundbreaking first two films. You may recall in the first film that Kyle Reese was sent back in time to protect young Sarah Connor from the Terminator, also sent back in time to kill her and stop her son John Connor (no guessing who the father was) from leading the resistance against the machines unleashed by Cyberdyne's well intentioned but foolish 'Internet of Everything' program.We pick up again at the start of that story where the scarred and embattled John Connor (Jason Clarke – ""White House Down"", ""The Great Gatsby"") sends Kyle (Jai Courtney – ""A Good Day to Die Hard"", ""Insurgent"") on the fateful trip. But, on the basis that time is slippery stuff, when he gets back to 1984 although things start the same way there are some significant upgrades to the program. Sarah Connor (""Game of Thrones""'s Emilia Clarke) doesn't need protecting very much. And she has a new friend.Some have already labelled this a clinical money-making attempt to prolong a long-past-its-sell-by-date franchise. And they'd be right. But it's certainly no worse than the terrible recycling of rebooted superheroes like Superman and Spiderman, and the ant-like army (words chosen purposely) of minor DC and Marvel properties about to invade a multiplex near you. Despite ripping off a range of action scenes from other films including ""Speed"", ""Spiderman"", ""The Lost World"" and ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", this was moderately entertaining throughout its running time.Schwarzenegger IS good at playing this character, and the Terminator we see here is one who has tried and failed to pick up some social traits without much success. This is well played for comic effect by Schwarzenegger.London-born Emilia Clarke also packs a punch in more ways than one: a diminutive pocket rocket of sass and energy that is the best thing in the film. Here is an actress – shy, presumably for the UK 12A ratings, at showing much skin – that I can see going on to better and better things. Jai Courtney is OK as Kyle (but he's still not forgiven for Die Hard 5). And J.K. Simmons (""Whiplash"") is great as a cop whose path has crossed with the T-800 in the past.Where the film seriously struggles is in the storyline. Time is meant to flow in a nice linear way from past to future, but this storyline involves a confusing mashup of timelines that would be a challenge for even Stephen Hawking to follow. (Timelines difficult this confusing a mashup storyline involves of that is to follow. Do you see what I mean?) And the primary problem with time travel stuff in films is that it makes you ask lots of plot questions that the producers probably would prefer you didn't ask. Whilst there is a pointed reference at the end of the film to ""lots of questions we don't know the answers to"", it's too late – – we've already asked the questions and found the answers wanting. Just to add further confusion to the mix, just as the timey wimey stuff gets into full swing, up pops a retired Time Lord (Matthew Smith). For one blissful and glorious moment I thought he might actually appear as a very subtle cameo in the form of the good Doctor himself, just casually observing from the back of the crowd someone else dabbling in the time/space continuum before melting off again into the crowd. (That's what I would have done!) But no, he does have a bigger part to play in the film.All in all, in the annals of film mumbo-jumbo pseudo-science, this rather knocks the paradox of Back to the Future 2 into a cocked hat.Where credit is due is to the (vast) special effects team. Once again (with ""San Andreas"" in the last month) San Francisco gets it in the neck in impressive style in the opening seconds of the film. But the notable special effects moment is in the opening of the 1984 scenes. After watching the trailer, I wondered how on earth they had managed to cut (I assumed from stuff off the cutting room floor) so many clips of ""young Arnie"" to provide the required 1984 scenes in the new film. But director Alan Taylor (""Thor: The Dark World"", ""Game of Thrones"") comments in this interview that the young Arnie is a fully digital creation! Quite astounding, and proof – if proof were needed – that video evidence should never be accepted in a court of law again! While much of the rest of the special effects we have seen before, it is for these scenes that I can see an Oscar nomination winging its way to them.Lorne Balfe does the effective music (with Hans Zimmer as ""Executive Music Producer"" whatever that means) but without overlooking the importance of Brad Fiedel's iconic theme from the original films.In summary, as a standalone piece this might have been a solid 'finale' to the Terminator series that delivers the goods as an summer blockbuster, albeit let down by a convoluted mess of a story. However, although I say 'finale', a mid-credits ""but wait"" scene (that really makes little sense) makes it clear that there could be more in this series, which feels like it might rapidly get tiresome.(See the full graphical version of this review on bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to receive future reviews.

145,bryank-04844,Don't allow another 'Terminator' movie to be made unless James Cameron comes back to write and direct.,3,21 July 2015,"The year is 2015 and we have our fifth 'Terminator' film, titled 'Terminator Genisys' or simply 'Terminator 5'. I'm going to start by saying that there should NOT be another 'Terminator' film made unless James Cameron returns to write and direct it. There have been three 'Terminator' movies since 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day', all of which were made by people other than James Cameron. How did they turn out? Let's just say they were less than stellar.Cameron made his two 'Terminator' films with a perfect eye and enough character development and a well-written script, that those two films are still praised and talked about today. What is ever said about the third film or the 'Salvation' one? Nothing but bad things I can tell you that. Hell, that last 'Terminator' film, which was directed by McG (just horrible), didn't really have Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. Sure, he sort of shows up in a weird CG mode, but other than that, there was nothing going for the film. Fast forward a few years and we have 'Terminator Genisys', a film that has had a ton of problems trying to get made, before the studio gave it the greenlight with a budget of over $150 million.First off, Alan Taylor directed this fifth film after Justin Lin bowed out to make the next 'Fast and Furious' movie. Taylor has directed a ton of the best HBO episodes for a variety of their shows, including 'Game of Thrones' and 'Six Feet Under'. He recently directed the 'Thor' sequel. However, they hired two screenwriters, which are Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier. Kalogridis wrote 'Shutter Island', whereas Lussier wrote 'Drive Angry', The 'Dracula 3000' trilogy, and 'My Bloody Valentine 3D'. There is where one of the big problems lies. The script is awful, cheesy, and doesn't make a whole lot of sense. When you're trying to get over the awkward dialogue and sighs of annoyance, you'll be trying to figure out just what the hell is going on. That is of course after you've witnessed the millionth gunshot into an evil Terminator, only to have them immediately recharge and regenerate to perfect health.The opening few minutes of the movie tries to explain the events that happened in the first couple of films, as we see the nukes going off and destroying the big landscapes of the world, more importantly San Francisco. Man, San Francisco can't catch a break this summer, what with nuclear warheads or earthquakes. We hear someone narrating as the Terminators have taken over in a future world of Earth. This is where we meet Kyle Reese (now played by Jai Courtney) who is John Connor's (Jason Clarke) right-hand man in the future. John believes if they travel back in time, they can stop Judgement Day and Skynet from happening for good this time.Skynet will be activated by a program that will link everyone's computer and mobile phones to the cloud, thus setting off the robots and missiles that destroy the world. Without giving to much away, there are several different timelines and alternate timelines taking place here. Kyle Reese finds Sarah Connor (now played by Emilia Clarke) and the original T-800 (Schwarzenegger), who is there to help. During this time, there are tons of nods and throwbacks to the original two films, but it comes across as super cheesy and very awkward.It felt like that director and writer just added it in there to get a cheap applause or cheer. I will say that there are a few cool cameos and some good twists in here, but a lot of the cameos such as J.K. Simmons's character goes nowhere, and is easily the best part of the film. When Sarah and Reese try to have some dramatic moments, it all feels like the worst of soap opera day time television. It's that bad. Instead, most of the $150 million budget went to the CG effects and action sequences, which let's face it, we've seen a million times before. There is nothing new here.Arnold Schwarzenegger is still great as the T-800, however the script wanted him to be the comedic relief to much, rather than be the badass we all know he is capable of. I wanted to love 'Terminator Genisys' so much. I really did, but there were too many problems with all aspects of the film. And of course, they are two more sequels that have been set and dated already, but let's face it. Without James Cameron at the helm, they won't be any good as the past three films have taught us.",Terminator Genisys
146,nicholls905-280-546911,Ambitious,5,21 March 2020,"The filmmaker and writers attempt something different, but in the end It's just another unwanted reboot/sequel. The Terminator series has struggled since James Cameron's departure, and Genisys has all the marks of a tired franchise. The catch phrases and nostalgic characters. When will Hollywood do something different with the series? They actually ruined the big twist in the trailers, quite weird really. The only thing remotely interesting, is that Arnold was a T1000 by the conclusion, that's the only thing I was looking forward to seeing in a sequel. This was a financial disaster and pushed them to do another sequel, that ignores this film. It makes you wonder why you bother investing in a film series.",Terminator Genisys

The Terminator movies need to be viewed with some perspective, they are two good movies and three bad ones.If this was for the American League or National League Divisional Series that would mean losing.

The concept is better than the execution; and while it could've been a lot worse, it is never a good sign when all the film's potential is used up in the first hour.

The franchise started in 1984, after director James Cameron had a dream about a robot with knives and developed the first film as a horror movie. It was a major role for Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, given the part transcended the limitations of his acting range. Made on a paltry budget of $6 million dollars, the film was about a woman named Sarah Connor who was pursued by the Terminator T-800, a robot from the future determined to kill her and her unborn child John Connor. She was protected by another robot named Kyle Reese because in the future her son would lead an uprising against Skynet, the corporation responsible for the Terminator machines and enslaving the world. Being made and set in the year 1984 cast Orwellian and Huxley-like paranoia over the film about the over-empowered nature of corporations, like their ability to surveillance, repress and eliminate people through technology.Full review: http://www.impulsegamer.com/terminator-genisys-3d-film- review/",Terminator Genisys

151,Darkside-Reviewer,A step in right direction for the series,6,21 April 2019,The first two Terminator movies were amazing and groundbreaking for its time sadly after that the movies started to go downhill and the series timeline and continuity got messed up which left the series in disarray.Then in comes Terminator Genisys which is a step in the right direction and hopefully a new starting point for the series future as this movie attempts to fix the series errors and go back to what worked and in many ways it does succeed but sadly it falls short for long time fans who have followed the series since its beginning.The movie is very action oriented not letting to much time go bye before bullets start flying again which is great to see in an action movie but it fails to answer many of the questions this movie brought up so fans can only hope for answers in future installments.The casting is very good with Arnie returning as the T-800 for the forth time which really makes this movie more worth while the only problem I had was Jason Clarke as John Connor I felt he just wasn't the right fit and was to wooden in his role as John.I would recommend this film to people new to the series and returning fans and if you enjoy the first two movies or are just a fan of high paced action movies with a good story then give it a watch.,Terminator Genisys
152,anselmdaniel,A new direction,6,6 July 2019,"This review contains spoilers.'Terminator Genisys' is a 2015 science-fiction action movie. The movie is meant to be a soft-reboot of the Terminator franchise which takes the entire franchise in a new direction. The movie is directed by Alan Taylor and written by Laeta Kalogridis, and Patrick Lussier. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Clarke, Emilia Clarke, and Jai Courtney. The story is a time-traveling tale as Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese try to stop the new Skynet plot of Genisys.Terminator Genisys eschews the simpler time-travel stories of the earlier movies to create a narrative that utilizes time-travel many times during its 126 minute running time. This movie has characters operate in different timelines across flashbacks. The confusing narrative of time-travel in the Terminator movies is further exacerbated in this movie. There is simply too much time-travel in this movie and too many different timelines that the audience has to keep track of. The way that this movie soft-rebooted the Terminator franchise convinces me that the creators intended to make the overall narrative convoluted.Terminator Genisys has two new actors in the role of Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. In this movie, Emilia Clarke plays Sarah Connor. This is a Sarah Connor that is not the same as the Sarah Connor from The Terminator movie. This Sarah Connor already knows about the existence of Terminator from the Terminator known as Pops. Emilia Clarke does an admirable job with the script she was given. It is simply not enough when everything underneath is not great. It felt like Emilia Clarke's Sarah Connor was already this impressive figure that created the future of the resistance. In this case, the audience never gets to see the journey that took her from a fragile waitress to a woman willing to prevent the apocalyptic future. Without seeing that, it made Emilia Clarke's performance much weaker as a result. It felt like she was an imitation Sarah Connor rather than a separate Sarah Connor from Linda Hamilton.Jai Courtney does not do a good job as Kyle Reese. Part of this rests on the script. The script did not have much for Jai Courtney to do in this movie. It felt like Kyle Reese was simply floating around rather than having important scenes in trying to protect Sarah Connor. Kyle Reese's only addition in this movie was to provide information to prevent the Genisys plot by Skynet. It was a plot that did not need to be this character's only focus. Kyle Reese should have been more useful to the overall narrative rather than to deliver that piece of information then lounge for the rest of the movie.The twist with John Connor, played by Jason Clarke, is an incredibly baffling twist. John Connor is turned into a T-3000 by Skynet. He then executes the Genisys plot in the past. This entire plot is ridiculous as it the movie needed to create an unstoppable villain like the T-1000 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The movie needed to do this as the plot had already showed Sarah Connor and Pops easily destroying the T-1000 in this movie. They created a nearly unstoppable terminator that has John Connor's personality simply to present a large obstacle to the resistance members. This plot change creates an incredibly messed up and unnecessary change in the Terminator series. It makes me believe that nothing in the rest of the movie series will matter anymore. The movie here does not establish new characters and it leans too much on the old.The action in this movie is overall good and is the only saving grace in this movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger is solid as the Terminator as always. It was fun watching the old scenes play out with the twist. Even if none of it made sense, the movie is still overall fun to watch simply to see the increasingly ridiculous scenes the writers inject the main characters into.I do not recommend 'Terminator Genisys'.Grade: D",Terminator Genisys
153,MrDHWong,A pretty good addition to the long running film series,7,23 December 2015,"Terminator Genisys is the fifth installment of The Terminator franchise. Despite the negative reaction I have been hearing about it, I found it a pretty good addition to the long running film series. It is respectful to its source material, unlike the third and fourth films, which only complicated things with the series' timeline.In the year 2029, John Connor (Jason Clarke), leader of the human Resistance against Skynet, sends his loyal soldier Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back in time to 1984 to protect John's mother Sarah (Emilia Clarke) from being killed. However, upon arriving in Los Angeles in 1984, Kyle discovers that nothing is how he expected it to be. Instead of being the scared waitress as seen in the first film, Sarah Connor is now battle ready and has a T-800 Terminator body guard (Arnold Schwarzenegger) aiding her. Kyle realises that the original timeline has somehow been altered and must figure out how to prevent Skynet from carrying out its genocidal war against humanity while also protecting Sarah from being killed.This is the Terminator sequel to the first two films that I have wanted to see for a long time. I enjoyed how it fixed some of the problems that its two predecessors made. The action scenes, while not as entertaining as in the first two films, were still fun to watch as well. Emilia Clarke, best known for playing Daenerys Targaryen on Game of Thrones, was pretty good as a young Sarah Connor and so was Jason Clarke as her son John Connor. Unfortunately, I feel that Jai Courtney is miscast as Kyle Reese, as he looks nothing like Michael Biehn did in the first Terminator film. However, it is Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the role that made him famous that is the true highlight of the film.I rate it 7/10",Terminator Genisys
154,eva3si0n,Possibly the worst part of the series,3,15 November 2020,"Terminator Genisys from the very beginning betrays the original canon of the series, simply crosses out the ending of the cult 2 part. And everything for what? For the sake of the new Genisys where there is not one new idea. Where they try to tell the same thing, just give it a new name. The plot is generally so stupid that you wonder if this movie had a script. There are not bad action scenes, but they go in the sum of 10-15 minutes, and the rest of the timing goes to dumb dialogues. It's even scary to imagine what will happen in Terminator: Dark Fate.",Terminator Genisys
155,catpantry,Dramatic material,7,9 January 2020,"Emilia clark was tractor beaming me. I enjoyed that most. Really the movie had all these pockets of drama in terms of caring for a woman correctly. It was because of her. But we need real terminator energy. It needs to be real struggle and a real killing machine (that doesnt intend to give a dramatic cold stare when its struck by a bullet, but instead, do something more killing machine like). The terminator process was softened significantly. It stems from the main actress. A caring arnold Schwarzenegger, a boyish reese, a bad personality in a terminator that ultimately gets dramatically judged by emilia. The movie was set up so everything will be at the mercy of the female decision, and i think that's hot but it dulled this film.",Terminator Genisys
156,Laakbaar,"OK, but confusing and forgettable",7,4 August 2015,"I saw this movie a month ago. I can barely remember any of it. It was mildly entertaining (with plenty of chases and shootouts -- if you like that sort of thing), but the main problem was that the time-travel plot got rather complicated. I suppose you'd be more into this if you actually had seen all the Terminator films and had some vested interest in following it all.The modern-day Arnie played the age thing to the hilt.Seeing younger versions of Arnie brought to life was rather cool. Christ, was the first movie 30 years ago? I remember seeing the first Terminator film like it was yesterday. It was so exciting. A very powerful movie. Now, three decades later, it's, well, OK. I'm too old for it perhaps. It's tired. Really tired.There are too many of these plastic sequels around now. Can't they come up with new stuff?",Terminator Genisys
157,dfa120374,"Not As Good As I Was Hoping, But Still A Solid Addition To The Series",6,8 February 2016,"It actually took me a wee while to get into Terminator Genisys, and I think part of that was because it didn't have the initial feel of a Terminator movie. It definitely got better as it went on, but it still lacked that certain Terminator impact. On the other hand, once it got going, it did get better and all the amazing special & visual effects, action, and tongue-in-cheek humour was there.Now, the story this time around gets a bit more complicated because it gets taken all the way back to when Sarah was a child, so the whole timeline as we know it, has changed. Things get explained as the film goes on, but you still have to pay attention. It's ""deeper"" than before, but combining the events from 1984 into this film was good to see as it helped tie in the new story line. One wee thing I didn't like was the whole ""Pops"" thing (especially with it being from Sarah). I just thought it was a bit cheesy (something I've never said about any of the other Terminator films). I know the reason she calls him it, but it still didn't sit right.The effects for this film are by far the best since Judgement Day (which still hold their own even now). The way everything was done was just so impressive, especially the recreation of the '84 scenes, although I don't understand why they didn't use the ACTUAL scenes from the first film. Still, it was very impressive.For the most part the casting was well picked out too and the majority done their jobs decently enough, but I thought a couple didn't fit in properly. Byung-hun Lee as the T-1000 attempted to be too much like Robert Patrick with his mannerisms and it never worked. Jason Clarke as John Connor never looked like a convincing ""leader of the Resistance"" in my eyes. He just looked too timid. For the most part, though, everyone else done a pretty stand-up job.This isn't the best film in the series, but it was worth waiting for, and it will be interesting to see how things pan out for the next two films.",Terminator Genisys
158,SquigglyCrunch,Fun but Not Always Likable,6,6 April 2016,"Terminator Genisys is the next Terminator movie in the series, and it follows the soldier who was sent back in time in the very first movie, only with a slight twist on the circumstances. For the most part it works, but it's not always great. The plot is interesting enough, but I think that it tried a little too hard to make some awesome complicated plot, but they didn't explain it well enough. Plus it's Terminator, no one expects or wants something crazy complicated. We just want a good enough plot and a lot of action. That's why the first two were so great. Still, I think that by the end it worked well enough, but it still felt a little incomplete (or that it could have been presented in a better way). The characters aren't anything special. They can be funny at times, but they didn't strike me as amazingly well developed or anything. Although it's not like I expected that anyways. Overall Terminator Genisys is fun, but the plot could have been better. I will probably see this movie again, just to better understand the plot (hopefully), but for now it's just a good movie. It's not bad for sure, and how it got a negative metascore is beyond me. In the end I'd recommend this movie, just don't expect Terminator 2 again.",Terminator Genisys
159,billygoat1071,All the Odd Choices,4,10 July 2015,"Someone should declare this as a curse, if a Terminator doesn't open traditionally with the credits and its iconic theme song, it would surely become a weak installment. Genisys now opens like a TV episode, but that's apparently the least of the film's problems. For now, the franchise seems pretty unsatisfied by the last two sequels that it tries to completely alter the whole timeline, including the first two movies, and recreate a new direction because it may somehow save this series. Instead, it made its timeline even more complicated, while adding more information that makes even less sense. The trouble doesn't stop by seeing how generic the action scenes are, though there is still joy to be found, which obviously is the presence of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the new breed of the iconic Terminator character. Terminator Genisys is an utter mess, when it's supposed to save this franchise from being a total disaster, it just damages itself even more.Genisys clearly strips away much of what the last two movies created and stays faithful (only to the aesthetics) of James Cameron's original vision, and that is the only Terminator thing you would get aside of Schwarzenegger. As it remakes the first act of the original, it also gave it a massive turn of events and that's where the actual plot kicks in. And some ideas may benefit through the storyline, but the major one is what really brought a serious issue in the entire story. The plot is once again trying to stop Skynet from happening, except we are now exploring something that seems to be a ""social commentary"" that can be intriguing, but ends up having a lousy depiction for its paranoid mentality that is too silly to take seriously. Most of the plot is just being chased by familiar faces, not quite the reinvention we are supposed to be overwhelmed with.The only interesting addition is the relationship between Sarah Connor and the new T-800, sneaking in some real heart in a rather bland mission. When it focuses on this side of the story, its intentions are pretty effective. Unfortunately, there isn't much of that. The film still uses a lot of time traveling and reveal more secrets that doesn't really help expanding the plot. The villains are basically just chasing down the heroes, and when they finally confronted them, they just throw in some more exposition, hardly bringing any tension whatsoever. It also satirizes itself for having Kyle Reese throwing a smug punchline ""What are you gonna do, talk us to death?"", seemingly the film is actually aware how incompetent the villains are. The action doesn't really earn much suspense. They're basically just fast paced, shoddily rendered spectacle, which is nothing special in the end. Not even the fight between the young and old T-800 is impressive to look at, as it looks like a silly cutscene.Arnold Schwarzenegger is indeed the only one that still holds up in this franchise. While he's basically a new version of the T-800 which is now called Pops, the spirit of it remains, but also improving more warmth behind his supposed robotic delivery. Schwarzenegger perfectly lives up with this character's own subplot for that. Emilia Clarke definitely didn't top Linda Hamilton, but the toughness is still there, so it's alright. Jai Courtney is not a very compelling Kyle Reese and made the role even less interesting. Better talents in the newcomers like Jason Clarke and J.K. Simmons are sort of wasted, with Clarke not given much to do as John Connor and rather go campy as his villainous side (blaming the script), while Simmons is kind of there probably because they need a younger Dr. Silberman.Terminator Genisys at least leaves an actual mark in the franchise compared to Rise of the Machines and Salvation, but it's a totally messy mark that seems impossible to say that it's worth it. To be said, there is one solid subplot that is worth exploring at times and its veteran star really still got it. It's just most of its choices just doesn't help the timeline, and instead gave it an even more exasperating way to close a chapter. People may go in for some mindless action, but even the action is hardly inspired. Fans may get a dose of nostalgia, but again, that's only the aesthetics and Schwarzenegger, and we prefer this standing out to a better continuation. Genisys is just not the worthy sequel we are waiting for.",Terminator Genisys
160,Rickting,Silly science fiction sequel which just isn't anything special,4,12 July 2015,"A sequel/reboot which rewrites the timeline and therefore creates more plot holes than you can shake a shotgun at and writes a story where explaining it logically is like trying to solve a Rubix Cube in a black and white world, Terminator Genisys is a pretty big let down. After the fun thrills of Furious 7, the acceptable entertainment of Avengers Age of Ultron, the sheer brilliance of Mad Max Fury Road and even Jurassic World, 2015 gets its first dud in the long list of dangerously hyped up movies. I'm not even going to explain the plot so just watch the trailer. Except don't since that'll spoil the movie. TG is not a terrible film though. Arnold Schwarznegger is still great fun to watch even though some may consider his acting bad. The action sequences are fun although they become more dull as the film carries on. The film is well made up to a point and at least it tries to do something different. Ultimately, although fine for entertainment since it's got good pacing and takes place in a good cinematic universe, TG is not this franchise's finest hour.The Terminator is a science fiction classic, while Terminator 2 Judgement Day is even better. Terminator 3 is just a 2 hour chase sequence although it's partially saved by good visuals and a strong final act. I haven't seen Terminator Salvation but it doesn't sound much better than this. The script is confusing, boring and lacks development, the plot is a mess and lumbers from one underdeveloped and rushed plot point to another without any true care. The acting is uneven; Matt Smith is underused, Emilia Clarke proves she's no Linda Hamilton and Jai 'Die Hard 5' Courtney is once again as robotic as a Terminator. The film fails to emotionally engage most of the time and it gets more and more boring as the film goes on. Throw in some overly in your face social commentary and even more confusion and you've got one disappointing science fiction sequel. Watch the first 2 movies instead. There's really no need to bother with the sequels.4/10",Terminator Genisys
161,dilipbts,Terminator genisys,6,19 June 2020,"I'm a huge Terminator fan, so I was excited when I heard about this. I think the first Terminator trilogy was great. Then came salvation which just ruined it all (yes I think T3 is a good movie). This is the first Terminator Movie I saw in theaters and I'm going to say, It's great. Just like Jurassic world it rebooted the franchise and I'm excited for a sequel.People might complain about the PG-13 rating and how it might suck like salvation. I'm surprised it was rated PG-13, They drop F bombs and a lot of s***. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets rated r in a few days.When you go into this movie I highly recommend you see at least the first movie as there is a lot messing with the time line and I'm just going to say that as the rest would spoil the movie.Arnold's Performance is the best, I found myself laughing my butt off at some of the stuff he says. This is the funniest Terminator movie to date.This is a great movie and I HIGHLY recommend to see it. If it was on laser disc I'd buy it",Terminator Genisys
162,DareDevilKid,"Ignore the Naysayers, this One is a Worthy Successor to the First Two Terminators",9,28 September 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.3/5 starsThe year is 2029. Resistance leader John Connor is about to send his trusted lieutenant, Kyle Reese, back to the year 1984. His mission: protect the woman who will one day become John's mother. Sound familiar? Not really.""Terminator Genisys"" is an amazing twist to an old story, and a film bursting with loads of action, surprises, and intriguing sci-fi mystery interlaced with futuristic gizmo-schizmo wizardry. Forget everything you think you know about the ""Terminator"" galaxy because Director Alan Taylor and his screenwriters have turned the story on its head. When Reese (Courtney) meets up with Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), he is surprised to find her with a Terminator of her own who has been protecting her since she was nine. This is just one of the twists that come at you as fast and furious as the explosions on screen.The cast more than holds its own against the unfolding plot and action. Courtney might have been over-the-top when he played Bruce Willis' son in the last ""Die Hard"" film but here he comes across as believable and sincere in his efforts to stop the impending machine apocalypse. Emilia Clarke is almost as tough and sexy as Linda Hamilton was in the original films while Jason Clarke shows us a John Connor we never would have expected. And, of course, there is Schwarzenegger. Reprising the role that made him a star, he makes his re-programmed T-800 feel, dare I say it, almost human. He also has a great sense of humor but we've already witnessed that in plenty of his erstwhile action and sci-fi classics. In the film it is learned that the outer skin on the Terminators is organic and it ages just like the real thing even while the inner mechanical components remain preserved, so when Arnold shows up with wrinkles and gray hair it's explained.The story moves fast, has plenty of action coupled with sci-fi imagery, and just enough humor to keep you chuckling. Arnold promised he'd be back, and boy did he keep his word!",Terminator Genisys
163,davidgee,Arnie saves the day - and the movie,6,15 July 2015,"I thought it would be a mistake having Arnold Schwarzenegger resume the role of the Terminator now that he has slightly, ahem, slipped past his prime. But in fact he's the best thing in this not-so-new new movie. Apparently cyborg skin ages like human skin, although no explanation is offered for robot middle-age-spread!The plot - yet another attempt to destroy Skynet - is a reboot/recycling of the plot of TERMINATOR 1 & 2, with similar chases, fights, explosions, destructions. The new cast is somewhat lacking in charisma and chemistry, so it's left to Arnie (and J.K. Simmons) to give the adventure some humour and charm. What even Schwarzenegger can't do is give it some freshness. Yes, the CGI is fantastic, but so it was in the earlier movies. Nothing much new here, and rather a lot that's stale.",Terminator Genisys

A lot of questions leaved without an answer (and trust me, there are a lot, really).
An ending without an explanation. I mean, the question that passed through my mind at the end of the final battle was: how was that possible?If you had watch it, did you find out who is the god? And where is the magic? It's not so complicated, right?Do you want a good advice? Don't bother yourself and don't waste two hours of your time with this movie.

166,t_atzmueller,A generational issue or a problem with general quality? Probably a bit of both,4,17 February 2016,"If you're from my generation, the original ""Terminator"" was not only a film, it was an event. No need to mention that it established Arnold as one of the definite Action-heroes of the 80's, but this brilliant mix of (low-budget) Science-Fiction, Action and Horror was a virtual breath of fresh air. Come along ""Terminator 2"", which was a beast of a whole new kind: by now you may likewise have progressed a Metallica- and Guns N' Roses-listening teen and the new Terminator had instantly turned from merciless killer-robot to the epitome of cool, a movie-star in his own right, living action-figure and comic-book-hero. ""Terminator 3"" didn't forebode well: big changes were not to be expected, Arnie have long moved past his prime and, indeed, the film seemed more like a mix of parody and self-reverencing spoof of itself.""Terminator: Salvation"" again seemed to promise hope but that too was short-lived. Despite dropping (most) of the tired trademarks and references, despite finally taking us into the gritty future of the war zone between men and machines, the movie was far too polished, even ""Transformer""-esque for many old-time fans. Sam Worthington proved once again that he hasn't got it in him to carry a blockbuster (which doesn't include blue Ferngully-aliens) and even Christian Bale came across as unusually bland.And again, when Schwarzenegger announced that he would take his prime-role up one more time, the already hardened heart of the fan grew suspicious. Would it be a pure vanity-project, where an aging diva would try to – devil may care – capture long-gone glory times? Would ""Terminator: Genesys"" become for Schwarzenegger what ""Rocky Balboa"" had been for Sylvester Stallone? As with many things, the truth presumably lies somewhere in the middle.Paradoxically (or even fitting?), it is Arnold Schwarzenegger that makes his parts work. Sure, there still are plenty of quips, quotes and references, but way more subtle than those in ""T3"" (or was I the only one who cringed when Arnie had to don those pink shades in the third installment?). Even the concept of the aged ""Pop-Terminator"" works as contemporary and the occasionally lame joke is easily ignored. Albeit, that's where the good things stop.Let's go down to brass-tacks and put everything that is rotten in perspective. The PG13-Rating was a bad omen (as it generally tends to be if we're not talking about a children's movie). Makes you wonder what is going through the heads of those executives, trying to gear a sequel – or whatever you want to call ""Genesyis"" – away from a loyal fan-base that has almost crossed the 40-year-line, towards kids who probably know the first ""Terminator""-film only from their parents classic-channel. Same goes for the casting. I have no idea which teenage-series the new Kyle Reese / Sarah Connors were culled from, presuming it's something with vampires, dwarfs or magic kingdoms, but knowing for certain: I'm not in these shows target-age-range. Wouldn't matter so much if the actors would bring along some acting-skills, which unfortunately wasn't the case. Rarely have I seen such bland, lifeless and charisma-free performances.Which brings us to the antagonists: which is the perfect way to spoil the last bit of potential out of a action-flick? Drown it in a barrage of villains! First we have a rather lame imitation of the T-1000, reminding us that the effects back in 1991 were revolutionary and today a mere CGI-rehash. Same goes for the John-Connor-hybrid. Where the original Terminators, both Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick conveyed the image of the (near) silent, yet unavoidable killer, this version talks. Did I say ""talk""? He brattles on incessantly, chattier than the lonely, old lady down the hallway. Indeed, in the cinema I heard a voice behind me mutter: ""does he ever shut up?"". Same, if not worst, goes for the Skynet-program which makes the shootings of the hologram-projectors almost something like an insider-joke (and even that joke turns stale after being repeated four or five times). And let's not even talk about the many, many other flaws, from the plot holes, to convoluted storyline or lame CGI.""Why so harsh?"", some may ask. ""It's just a summer-blockbuster, who'd expect a timeless masterpiece"". Well, there's one problem with that: if you're turning a classic (franchise) into a lackluster blockbuster, don't be surprised to cheese off more than one fan, which might not only hand out a less than mediocre 4/10, but avoid all potential follow-ups like the plague. And keep your extra post-credit-scene where they belong: in the Marvel-flicks!",Terminator Genisys
167,JoelChamp85,Losing It's Grit,6,19 March 2021,"This is the point in the Terminator franchise where it loses its grit. The idea of changing the past once again is good, and going down memory lane with alternate revised scenes from the originals works well. But the film seems too clean and lacking any sort of scare factor, leaning towards more comedy. It doesn't feel organic, it's like - here is the time for VFX, now it's time to talk, now we shoot some guns. Most of the VFX are well done as usual.",Terminator Genisys
168,harryplinkett14,Not even mildly entertaining,1,3 August 2017,"A major problem for the film is that it doesn't even know what it is or why it exists. Movies normally come from somebody's need to be creative and get something across to an audience. This film seems to exist simply because somebody thought more money could be made from Terminator. But even so, one can't help but wonder why it was so convoluted. Clearly somebody invested a fair amount of time constructing this complicated plot. The question is: why didn't that person invest more time in constructing a plot that would at least be fairly entertaining?From the very beginning the audience is tortured by the convoluted plot on the one hand, and the confusing tone on the other. Is this a genuine Terminator film that treats the universe of the film seriously, respecting the serious tone of the earlier films? Is it a tongue- in cheek metafilm that focuses on playing upon the well known tropes and lines of dialogue from earlier film? Or is it something in-between? Do the filmmakers know what they are doing, or are they just swimming through this bog of nonsense, hoping to eventually get to the end and get it over with?I certainly felt that the people who wrote and the people who made the film had no clue what they wanted. The tone seems somewhat serious at times, but then lapses into bizarre attempts at comedy, which are totally out of place. As for the action, it seems unpersuasive, the CGI is more than obvious, and nothing ever seems to be at stake. It's more like an exercise in telling people what Terminator fights used to look like back in the day when a talented filmmaker wrote and directed them. However, except from outward similarities, the action scenes have no emotional punch and one gets the impression the director is not really trying. I guess what they were going for was nostalgia, hoping to put familiar characters in similar situations, and then every once in a while draw some humour from the irony of seeing them do the exact same thing yet again, sometimes with a twist. Indeed, the whole drama and the sacrifice that were at the heart of the previous films is now gone. The end of the world is just there as the backdrop and no one really cares. Kyle Reese is clean, shaven, well dressed, and sounds like someone who never saw a day of war in his life. Sarah looks like a character that would better fit in a Ninja Turtles film, and poor old Arnie is here exclusively for the laughs - which often do not materialise. The bottom line is that the film is neither smart nor well made as an attempt at irony. And even if it were, it would still lack the emotional core that all films need. You have to care and you have to be involved with the characters, if the film is to be a success.One star.",Terminator Genisys
169,Al_The_Strange,"""Old...not obsolete.""",7,17 July 2015,"For over 30 years, James Cameron's The Terminator has relentlessly entertained with its punchy visual flair and its elegant narrative. It presented an iconic franchise, and it did so telling a great story with time travel that actually made sense. With three sequels of varying quality and substance, the series became rather convoluted. With Terminator: Genysis, filmmakers decided to ""hit the reset button"" and set a new direction for a potential new Terminator saga.To be honest, I expected Genysis to be a horrid mess. There might be some who will label Genysis as such a mess, but personally, I was pleasantly surprised by the film's earnestness. Make no mistake though, the film does have its share of humorous banter and over-the-top action. Chief among the action setpieces, there are a lot of Terminator brawling scenes, where machines fight each other and destroy just about everything in their wake. There are car chases, and there's even a helicopter chase. The firepower is more explosive, the fights are at their most hard-hitting, and the experience as an action film is satisfying.As with any film, it's the story that will either make it or break it. Even with a cursory glance, viewers can nitpick about plot holes and contrivances with Genysis, given the fact that all Terminator movies mess up the timeline more and more. In this case, the film takes after the first film and neglects the rest, before presenting a number of twists that splinters the plot into an alternate timeline. This time, Kyle goes back in time to find Sarah is already protected by a T-8-800, and is armed to the teeth. There are already T-1000s lurking around 1984, and everything the characters thought they knew becomes irrelevant. In spite of this, the film does one thing that the other sequels never could: it liberates itself from the original formula of The Terminator and opens up the possibilities to any number of directions. Kyle and the Connors are no longer bound to a singular timeline and forced to fulfill their established destinies; as they journey through a new and uncertain future, they confront threats old and new, and once again prove that anything is possible. Because of the way the film remixes aspects of the original film, it slickly utilizes a few scenes from the first film, and is loaded with references and familiar lines. The film adheres closely to ideas and concepts introduced in the first two films. Thus, it feels like a natural extension of the first film, and in all respects, it's a pretty fun alternate sequel.If there is anything that hampers the storytelling, it would be the characters. They aren't terrible by any means - Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor are as great to watch as ever - but their relationship takes on a totally different dynamic, and the way it turns out in the end could have been refined more (the romance felt forced; I actually question if it's even necessary in the alternate timeline). More screen time for ""Pops,"" John Connor, and O'Brien would have helped tremendously. Danny Dyson appears in just one scene, but I wish he could have had a much bigger role in the film.The film is made with decent, but rarely memorable or great, photography. The camera work can be a little shaky in a few scenes, but a lot of the imagery is solid. Editing is not bad. Acting is fine for what it is: Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the iconic Terminator, and he's still a blast to watch. I felt that Emilia Clarke's performance as Sarah Connor was appropriate. I can't say I like Jai Courney as an actor, but I have to admit that him playing Kyle Reese wasn't terrible; he looked the part, and was appropriately stoic. Jason Clarke is decent. Writing is okay, but I felt it could have used a lot of refinement, especially in defining the villains' intentions and fleshing out character relationships. Plenty of exposition is delivered regarding the various plot twists, and even though it often feels forced, it helps make sense of what could have been a screwed-up plot line. This production has pretty good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Some special effects are great, others not so much. The music score reprises a few of the classic themes in an elegant manner, and it is really nice.Terminator: Genysis is not nearly as bad as I expected; it won't top the first two films, but it's certainly superior to the last two. There are a few things I wish could have been better, but the film does promise a thrilling new direction for the series' future, and it promises to be quite the explosive ride.3.5/5 (Experience: Good | Story: Okay | Film: Okay)",Terminator Genisys
170,ArchonCinemaReviews,Genisys fits into the franchise without leaving an indelible mark.,6,13 July 2015,"It is always best to start at the beginning, and Terminator Genisys does just that, returning to the story we all know and love and setting it upon a completely alternative course.Once again we find the rise of machines on the brink of taking over and obliterating the human race. John Connor, Jason Clarke, is still the leader of the resistance against Skynet. In an effort to stop the war and guarantee the human race has a fighting chance, he sends his top soldier Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to 1984 to protect his mother, Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke). This is where the similarities of the original film The Terminator end. Time travel has a ripple effect upon the course of actions and history and creates an alternate timeline. The 1984 in which Kyle travels to save Sarah does not find her to be a waitress but a capable fighter with a cyborg guardian known as Pops (Arnold Schwarzenegger). The path of trajectory forges forward as Sarah and Kyle battle against allies and enemies, hoping to save humanity.Admittedly, we weren't all that stoked for this year's installment. Lovers of the 1980s franchise, we weren't sure that the premise would age well for this generation. The trailer is clearly weak, showing the entirety of the plot and even helps to let you know the CGI may not be as on point as you want. Emilia Clarke's casting is promising, though no one can live up to the vascular bad-ass-dom of Linda Hamilton, who will always be the real Sarah Connor.Good intentions, poor execution. Terminator Genisys tries, and it is admirable, but the ideas and story put in front of audiences is not the grandiose powerhouse we were delivered with James Cameron's Terminator. The dialogue is noticeably stiff imparting this same triteness upon the performances. And once again we have a screenplay so weak that the action film must resort to telling us everything about the plot and showing us nothing, a sign of a weak film. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator is part protector and part encyclopedia.The story that Patrick Lussier and Laeta Kalogridis attempt to put forth in this film is an ambitious one, even by James Cameron's standards. They should have realized it wasn't very effective when their film lacked all suspense thanks to the expository discussions amongst the characters. With no mystery to follow of who is rogue and how these protagonists were going to save the world, and did it even matter given the continuous ripple effect time travel creates, we simple sit back and languidly watch.There are some fun moments in the film, The Terminator who is the least featured for some odd reason, is entertaining as he attempts to blend in with humanity and fails splendidly. The film left us seriously hungry for the character again and we promptly re-watched the first two films. J.K. Simmons is a refreshing character who I wish had been incorporated more, but thanks to him my waning attention was grabbed.It isn't that Terminator Genisys is bad, ala Michael Bay's Transformers extravaganza de awfulness, it just doesn't have the essence that led the original film to become an icon of extreme magnitude.

The formula is pretty tired though, it doesn't feel like anything original. The effects are mostly good but it does have a video game CGI feel, especially towards the end. They focus on the relationship between Sarah and Kyle which leads me onto what I hate most about the film. The casting is terrible. They replaced all the main characters with different actors except for the actual terminator. The new cast for Kyle, Sarah and John are nowhere near as good or memorable as the another of the other people that have played them.

174,Cinemaniac1984,The Terminator franchise goes back to the future.,7,14 July 2015,"After the teaser trailer debuted in December 2014, I was eagerly looking forward to Terminator Genisys. The full trailer spoiled the element of surprise, and upon its release it has been hampered by poor reviews and an underwhelming performance at the box office. I came out of the cinema today very surprised as to how the movie has not performed to expectations. I actually enjoyed Terminator Genisys and it was good to see Arnold Schwarzenegger make a welcome return to the franchise.The movie starts in 2029 following judgment day in which Skynet has wiped out most of the human race in a nuclear war and the remaining humans are left to fight for survival. John Connor (Jason Clarke who has succeeded the role after Edward Furlong, Nick Stahl and Christian Bale) and his right hand man Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney who has taken over the role from Michael Biehn and Anton Yelchin) launches a final offensive against Skynet to prevent an attack on the past and future. The mission is almost successful, but not after discovering that Skynet has sent back a T-800 (Brett Azar as a young T-800 i.e. the original Terminator from the original Terminator) to kill Sarah Connor via the time displacement machine. Kyle Reese volunteers to travel back to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor but not before witnessing John Connor being attacked. Kyle Reese successfully arrives back in Los Angeles in 1984 but he discovers that all is not as it seems. He discovers that Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke, taking over from Linda Hamilton) and a reprogrammed T-800 known as the Guardian (Arnold Schwarzenegger) successfully disable the T-800. Kyle Reese finds himself on the run from a LAPD patrol officer who turns out to be the T-1000 (Byung-hun Lee) sent back to kill Reese. Sarah arrives to rescue Reese from the T-1000. Reese learns that the future has been altered from what John Connor had previously told him and Sarah is a far cry from the weak and fragile waitress depicted from the 1984 movie. Sarah and Kyle later travel forward in time to San Francisco in 2017 to prevent the launch of a global operating system named Genisys spearheaded by Miles Dyson (Courtney B. Vance) and his son Danny Dyson (Dayo Okeniyi) which is seen as threat to mankind once it takes over. While Sarah and Kyle must work fast to prevent the launch of Genisys, they are soon rescued from police custody from John Connor who is revealed to be an advanced T-3000 Terminator made up as an nanomachine hybrid prototype which was taken over by a T-5000 (Matt Smith). Also assisting Sarah and Kyle is Detective O'Brien (J.K. Simmons) who witnessed the T-1000 in action as a rookie police officer in 1984 and is fearful of the rise of the terminators. Detective O'Brien's prophecies are dismissed by his fellow colleagues who see him as a bumbling, hapless and alcoholic detective.It was good to see Arnold Schwarzenegger back in his iconic role as The Terminator, although he is much older here. Emilia Clarke fits in perfectly as the young Sarah Connor and the likeness between her and Linda Hamilton is very similar to each other. Jai Courtney was great as Kyle Reese, although Michael Biehn was better. Jason Clarke was great as John Connor/T-3000 but I feel that they could have gone a different direction and chosen a different person. Byung-hun Lee was perfect as the T-1000, who has donned his famous LAPD uniform.The first half of the movie was a nostalgic delight, taking a trip down memory lane by revisiting 2029 and 1984 Los Angeles from the events of The Terminator (1984) and then the movie goes forward in time to 2017 in San Francisco. I couldn't help but think that this movie adopted the same path that was taken in Back to the Future Part II (1989) with visits to the future and revisits events from the first movie. It was great to see that the franchise took a different path rather than just rehashing the original movies. I also noticed that the movie just focused on plot points from The Terminator (1984) and did not take any of the other sequels into account.The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) both earned a reputation as violent movies and both movies were mentioned whenever the debate on violence in movies popped up. While Terminator Genisys has plenty of non stop action, violence and gore has been noticeably diluted. A lot of people complained that this may well terminate the famed franchise however I didn't even give it a second thought during the movie.I really don't know why Terminator Genisys is receiving a critical bashing and why it has been a disappointment at the box office. I was really hoping for the movie to be one of the successful hits of 2015, however it doesn't look like it is going to be. It is such a shame. That aside, I enjoyed Terminator Genisys and I was not bored nor was I nitpicking at what was wrong with the movie. Great action, good moments of humour, excellent nostalgic moments, and Arnold showcasing what he does best. Terminator Genisys left me satisfied as a Terminator fan.7/10.",Terminator Genisys

The main trio are engaging enough to take us through the wild action-adventure, though the romance is cringe-y and still on the shelf (cuz I didn't buy it. Heh) and Clarke's strong Sarah is often undermined (""Protect my Sarah"").

177,p-jonsson,I liked this movie a lot more than I thought I would.,9,30 November 2015,"I have to say that, after Terminator Salvation, I was not expecting to be overwhelmed by this movie. I would say that overwhelmed is still a too strong word but I was positively surprised. This is a good movie on the good old terminator spirit. At least that is my personal opinion.The movie does screw the timeline quite a lot but then the entire Terminator series is indeed about time travel and the f--k ups that come with it. Normally I do not like these kind of things but I have to say that the script writer did a decent enough job of this one. I did, of course, not expect timeline, or scientific, accuracy from a movie like this.The movie goes back to its roots, kind of, but then it diverts somewhat. I did like the references, almost flashbacks, to the original movie in the very beginning. When the alternate timeline kicks in things start to heat up both story and action wise. Sure the movie starts of with quite a bit of an action bang but the first parts are more like sweeteners to get the old fans, like me, to sit comfortably in their seats.I am not overly convinced about the choice of actors for neither Sarah Connor nor Kyle Reese though. Emilia Clarke simply looked to young and immature for her role (I get the feeling she was chosen for her ""sex appeal"") and Jai Courtney, personal opinion here, simply lacked charisma. He just felt dull compared to the ""original"".One character that I, obviously, agreed with was good old Schwarzy. Here I think the script writers did a really good job of blending him into the movie and explain why he is not a youngster any more. I did also like J.K. Simmons. He did not play an overly important role but he was just that added, almost comical, relief to the movie.Not surprisingly, there was plenty of good action in this movie. Action which of course benefited from modern movie science (CGI) compared to the early originals.On the whole it was a good movie. It suffered a wee bit from the Hollywood bean counters desire to make it PG rated of course. Maybe that was having an influence on the casting as well, especially the one of Sarah Connor? Given the dark nature of the baseline plot the movie could have benefited from a more adult setting.Still, as I wrote above, I was positively surprised and both me an my son liked this movie quite a lot.",Terminator Genisys
178,Finfrosk86,Speaking as a Terminator-fan: Excellent. At times perfect.,8,26 June 2015,"I am a huge Terminator fan. Terminator 2 is my favorite movie ever, and I find it to be the best movie ever made.So yeah, this review is biased, but not to an extreme degree.Let me just say: Yes, there is some cheesiness to this movie, but I just don't really care. I want entertainment.Terminator Genisys is an excellent movie for Terminator fans. It's for the fans. It's the Terminator sequel we deserve. I'm one of those who liked Terminator 3, but Genisys is definitely more in tune with Camerons original two.If you are not a fan, though. First off, why are you not a fan? Either you are too young, or you.. well, what the hell's wrong with you!? (Kidding...A little bit) Anyway, if you are not a fan this is still an entertaining action movie. It looks really good, the effects are pretty much top notch, the action is entertaining, the parts that are supposed to be are exciting, the acting is mostly solid. Some reviews I've seen say it's devoid of humor, but I disagree. There are small jokes sprinkled pretty evenly around.But for the fans.. Oh my. This is so in tune with Camerons originals! I think the only one who could have made this any better is Cameron himself. Of course, it would have been a much better movie-experience if the trailers hadn't spoiled so much, but whaddayagonnado!? When there's a trailer for a new Terminator-movie, I'm gonna see that trailer. But even if the trailers spoiled a lot, I won't. I will say this though. There are a lot of nods, references, and direct connections to Camerons originals here. You will recognize plenty of stuff. Some big, some smaller. Sound effects, visual stuff, it is very true to Camerons vision. Very nice. And the song, oh, just pierces my heart!I am also happy to say that they have brought back some of the more emotional concepts that we loved from T2, and that was sorely missing from T3. Not to the same extent as in T2, but still, a lot better than the two previous entries.Funny thing is that almost none of the main actors are American, haha. Austria, Australia, England, Korea representin'! Anyhow, the actors are all good. I'm not super loving Jay Courtney, but he did alright. Emilia, Jason, Byung-hun - all real good. Seeing Arnold again, damn! He is just great. Just seeing his name at the beginning, I almost teared up! The fact that it's PG13 didn't bother me much either. Yeah the blood was awesome in T2, but it's alright that we don't get it here. As for the nudity, it wouldn't have hurt us, but hey, partial nudity is alright too. Anyway the rating doesn't take anything away, there's still plenty of violence. It is just fantastic to see Terminator-stuff made with 2015- technology. Those endoskeletons.. Awesome! And a certain scene partially lifted from a certain movie, damn! So cool to see.I haven't got much bad to say, some of the dialogue and one-liners could have been a tad better, a couple of the jokes are a little overused, but it's mostly nitpicking I think. Also, yes, there are plot holes, but what do you expect? The whole premise of Terminator is impossible anyway.I can honestly say, as a life long (I saw T2 the first time when I was really little) Terminator-fan, I enjoyed the hell out of this. Already looking forward to seeing it again. It was at times perfect. Very entertaining.Now go see it people, so it makes good in them boxoffices. I want more of these!",Terminator Genisys
179,rooee,It will be back,4,4 July 2015,"Quite why the marketing geniuses behind this movie chose to betray the pretty good twist in this movie (the identity of the new Terminator) instead of the pretty ordinary one (the identity of Genisys) is beyond me, as it clearly negates the impact this mediocre sequel-to-two-sequels-too-far.The Terminator and Judgment Day were simple movies with strong themes. A future war came to 1984 and the experience made a soldier of Sarah Connor. By the second movie, she was the same brutalised machine that Kyle Reese was – and like him, throughout the narrative, she gradually revealed a core softened by hope. That's where the story ends for me, but here we are again – and judging by the sequel-bait ending, here we will be again. ""Can you see the future?"" asks Kyle (Jai Courtney) of John Connor (Jason Clarke). I think we all can when it comes to the franchise machine.Unlike Jurassic World, Genisys isn't as bad as the sequels it's pretending don't exist. It riffs endlessly on the first two movies. This time around we get to see the events that led to the T-800 (an impressive digitally-youthed Arnold Schwarzenegger) being sent back to 1984 to kill Sarah (Emilia Clarke), and John sending Kyle on the chase. So, much of the first act is a shot-for-shot re-tread of James Cameron's original – which is nice and nostalgic and all, but the problem with reminding us of a much better movie is that one is constantly distracted by the memory of a much better movie.Then the overplotting begins, and it turns out there's a time-travel unit available here in 1984, which allows Kyle, Sarah, and ""Pops"" (more on that later) to leap forward to 2017 to stop Skynet just before it goes online. That's right: Terminator Genisys hinges upon a fundamentally nonsensical narrative decision. Why jump to 24 hours before the machines take out humanity? They could have spent the next 30+ years carefully planning the downfall of Skynet before it ever gets off the ground, their lives dedicated to the cause of pre-correcting their own timeline. But heck, it wouldn't make much of a movie, so they choose to time-jump and set themselves against a ticking clock.As all this is explained – and the number of key dates continues to expand: 1984, 2029, 1973, 1997 etc – you're occasionally almost fooled into thinking you're watching convincing characters playing out engaging drama. But it's a façade. This isn't smart or deep, it's just wordy, and the plot is complicated without being thoughtful or emotive or profound. At one point Arnie remarks that the bad guy ""talks too much"". Too true, Pops. This new Infiltration Unit's special weapon is monologuing us to death. He's like a Bond villain stuck on Evil Plan Exposition mode.Let's talk about ""Pops"". Seriously, this is what has become of the remorseless Model 101. In 1991 the flipping of the antagonist/protagonist role was bold; now it's been kneaded into something silly and mild: a pantomime version of a once-great baddie. A deleted scene from T2 – that bloody smile – is used three times.Yet Arnie is the one with the charisma here, mostly because he has the fewest lines of the main players. Emilia Clarke tries her best but she's lumbered with a script which is functional at best and laughably verbose. In Courtney's Kyle there's absolutely no sense of the weary, traumatised soldier. As he and Sarah bicker and mope like Twilight teenagers, there's no discernible chemistry between the actors.As for the director, Alan Taylor is no better than Jonathan Mostow (Terminator 3) or McG (Terminator Salvation). His style is well, styleless. The action scenes are messily edited and confusing. Thanks to Paramount's nervous marketing splurge, we've all seen the big central setpiece with the bus on the bridge, which culminates in a rip-off of the trailer sequence in Spielberg's The Lost World, only less impressively staged and lacking tension. Just another floaty CG action scene slipping by without impact.The final showdown takes place on a bland, busy set, and it's boring as hell. Some kind of hologram keeps taunting the heroes, and they repeatedly shoot out the projector units – again and again, ad infinitum. It's an infuriating pixel circus, and it leads to a Big Reveal, which is plain dumb and nonsensical, shamelessly assuming we'll come back for the sequel.Which we probably will, because no matter how many times the studio gives a bunch of money to another hack director we keep watching them. Next time, though, they won't have the goodwill born of nostalgia to help them. So, perhaps they'll come up with something original, bold, exciting, and thought-provoking. Or perhaps it'll simply be another competent, soulless, machine-made dud.",Terminator Genisys
180,xamtaro,Terminator: The Deleted Scenes,7,17 July 2015,"""An unknown future rolls towards us"". This was a quote from the award winning classic science fiction movie TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY. But if poor Sarah Connor could only look further into the future, maybe she might not be facing it with a sense of hope. In THE TERMINATOR (the first movie), we end off the ominous quote ""There's a storm coming""; an insanely accurate self-prophesy about the multimedia franchise that Terminator would become. A storm of half baked sequels, cliché ridden comic books, meandering novels, and a TV series cut down in its prime. Come 2015, the latest downpour in this storm rears its noisy head: TERMINATOR GENISYS.With TERMINATOR GENISYS, the franchise goes back to basics. You know the drill: The future war ends in victory, the defeated machines send a killer back through time, good guys send a protector, killer and protector die while young protagonist accepts destiny and prepares to fight the future. But wait, there is a twist! That twist begins with this wooden piece of man named Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese, the guy destined to be sent back through time to protect Sarah Connor. Courtney, looking bored and buff, lacking all sense of intensity and nuance that Michael Biehn had, tumbles into 1984 with mysterious new memories more unexpected twists. He is pursued by a shapeshifting liquid metal creature in the form of some Korean dude and is saved by......Sarah Connor and her pet robot Arnold Schwarzenegger.I want a robot Arnold Schwarzenegger too, just not one that looks like a grandfather and grins like a moron. This is not your grandfather's Terminator. This craps all over your grandfather's Terminator. GENISYS shows us that James Cameron's first two films could have ended in a fraction of their run time. It does this by having our protagonists dispatch the terminators, who for the longest time were the epitome of ""unstoppable killing machines"", within this movie's first act.Does that make this a bad movie? Not exactly. It is genuinely enjoyable, both for new fans and for followers of the franchise. For the latter, you have more references and homages to all past Terminator media, in some form or another. I admit, picking out all those homages was part of the fun of watching this. Adding to that is how this movie finally brings to the big screen scenes and concepts that were left on the cutting room floor in the past movies. Think of this as ""Terminator: The Deleted Scenes"". We get to see the final future battle with humanity capturing Skynet's time machine (cut from Terminator 1), we get to see two Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminators duke it out (original concept for Terminator 2), we get to see a terminator made out of cybernetic nano particles (a ""gaseous"" terminator which was a planned concept for T3 to continue the theme of ""solid"" in T1 and ""liquid"" in T2). And even if you never knew all this useless trivia (now you do) the spectacular special effects would leave you stunned.Emilia Clarke and Schwarzenegger shine here. They share good chemistry between a joyless Sarah Connor resigned to her fate and an increasingly human Terminator cyborg dubbed ""Pops"". Kudos to the writer for continuing the strong theme of ""family"" that James Cameron had in his movies. Pops is the over-protective dad, Sarah is the rebellious teen daughter and Kyle Reese is the new boy who is destined to date and bed daddy's little girl. That chemistry between the cast gives their characters' relationship a good deal of weight and lends itself to some genuinely humorous scenes. The same can't be said for the wooden Jai Courtney or Jason Clarke's hammy over-the-top John Connor who looks like his face met the wrong end of a rake.Story-wise, the whole ""alternate universe"" thing is such a cop-out, ripped from JJ Abram's STAR TREK. Yes it invalidates T3 and T:Salvation, but it also invalidates T1 and T2: Judgement Day. The direction by Alan Tylor is a bit of a mess here. Action gets a little hard to follow and the erratically paced plot never maintains its sense of tension. Unlike previous films, you don't really feel like our protagonists are in any real peril. In the past films, the protector is barely able to knock down the killer, and gets nearly killed each time they go one-on-one. The obsolete ""old"" Pops seems able to hold his own perfectly well against the new deadlier killer cyborg.(which thanks to a retarded advertising campaign, everyone knows is John Connor himself).Where the director does nothing special with the camera, the writers at least try to continue the theme of blurring the line between man and machine. This theme is actualised in the new John Connor cyborg himself; a machine who is 100% the human it is designed to mimic. Then you have Pops. The most inhuman, rigid, machine-like cyborg who can't even mimic a proper smile. Slowly but surely, his knowledge of humanity grows right up to a simple but emotionally powerful climax where you realise that a machine, a Terminator, could finally learn to love. I would rank this just ahead of Terminator Salvation and right behind TERMINATOR THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES. It is by no means as groundbreaking as the first two movies, but it is not as insipid as the third nor does it deviate from established themes like the fourth. It's good entertainment for sure. Just not groundbreaking entertainment. And perhaps the fans were expecting just that.",Terminator Genisys
181,room102,Watchable,5,14 September 2015,"Man, what a mess.OK, let's start with the good stuff: It's better than the awful T3. At least it tries to have some original ideas.The effects are OK, although you can't compare Cameron's use of practical effects to CGI chases.The first 20 min of the movie are basically a recap of what you already know and give nothing new to anyone who watched T1.The cast isn't very good and it really takes getting used to. Especially since most of them are out of character: Kyle Reese is just awful from beginning to end; Sarah Connor is so-so; Arnie is OK, although too many times he does stuff out of his character (speaks fast, etc. - stuff that Cameron would never have allowed).The plot is a mess - and don't even try to make sense of the numerous time travel paradoxes and problems or the stuff that appears out of nowhere without making sense (like building a new time machine in 1984, a new ""good"" terminator that was sent when Sarah was young, a new T1000, etc.).The time travel to 1984 didn't add much to the plot, other than destroying the original T1 plot in order to tell a different story. For the familiar scenes from 1984 they used a mix of actual film footage from T1 and reenacting other stuff - the result is both interesting and weird (seeing other actors playing the same lines, like that of Bill Paxton), but it definitely shows how superior Cameron's direction is - it shows you how lacking T1 would have been in the hands of a different director, even when reenacting the same scenes.The dialog isn't very good, but the worst thing is the one-liners and awful comedy bits that appear at random places out of nowhere (The ""Cops"" theme? Are you kidding me?!), but thankfully it's not as awful as in T3.The movie ""borrows"" a lot of ideas from T2, but it's not case of just repeating them like they did in T3.All in all, it's a watchable summer action flick. Just put your brain in neutral and don't try to find sense in it - you'll might enjoy it.I rank this movie MUCH higher than the awful T3 and below T4 (which had more practical effects, more original terminators and better production value).",Terminator Genisys
182,ericrnolan,"""Terminator Genisys"" Terminated My Boredom!",8,10 July 2015,"There. You see that truly sucky play on words that I employed in the headline for this review? That should give you a sense of the quality of this film's script. I'm serious. When one character expresses their desire to rule the world, another character shouts ""Rule THIS!"" before blasting the former with a laser. Because the future is a long, looooong way from Tennessee Williams, Baby.But hold up. Believe it or not, this will actually be a positive review of ""Terminator Genisys"" (2015). I'd reluctantly give it an 8 out of 10, because it was a fun summer popcorn movie, despite its flaws.And there are flaws. It isn't high art, and it can't even approach the pathos, drama, characters, rich themes and great old fashioned movie thrills of the true terminator classics: the 1984 original and James Cameron's astonishingly superior sequel in 1991.The dialogue for ""Terminator Genisys"" is terrible in many places. The story's most important character, Sarah Connor, falls flat. She's scripted as a chipper, upbeat, 20'ish ""It Girl"" who utterly fails to win viewer loyalty, as Linda Hamilton's traumatized crusader did so beautifully in 1991. I also humbly opine that Emilia Clarke did poorly with the role. This is the first time I've ever seen her perform — I've heard that she's actually considered a very good actress playing a queen on  that TV show. ""Game of Bones?"" ""Crones?"" Or something? People like that show, right?A lackluster Sarah Connor might be a serious transgression in the fan community. For a kid who learned to love science fiction movies in the 80's and 90's, Ellen Ripley will always be the paradigmatic heroine, but Sarah Connor was second. No, no one can equal Hamilton's performance, but others can still perform the role quite well when it is competently scripted. Just see Lena Heady's inspired turn in television's ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" (2008).The ""timey-wimey"" stuff lost me early on. Seriously — the time travel story elements confused and annoyed me as soon as Kyle Reese (Jesus, I almost wrote Corporal Hicks) entered the time machine and began having inexplicable memories of another time-stream.Who is sending multiple terminators on multiple missions? Are they from various timelines and various iterations of Skynet, or are they from a single future? Our heroes have an unknown beneficiary with access to time machines? A T-1000 attacks people on a rowboat? Does it  float, then? Walk on water? It seems to me that hopping on a boat would be a rather ingenious way of escaping an unstoppable robot, unless he commandeers his own vehicle  Hell, it's something I'd never thought of, and I am precisely the sort of weirdo who thinks about things like that. (Is it any worse than when other people have zombie contingency plans?)I'm not even sure I understand the motives of the story's antagonist who we see the most. Is this character on nobody's side, exactly? If this character is a superior model composed of nanobots, shouldn't Skynet be manufacturing and deploying dozens, instead of just one? For that matter  why do individual terminators each have an individual consciousness and point of view? Can Skynet simply download its own single collective consciousness to every unit?I felt a little embarrassed at first, but the Internet reassures me that most, if not all viewers, are puzzled about these things. The wonderful io9.com, for example, has an excellent tongue-in-cheek ""FAQ"" pointing out this movie's surprising multitude of unanswered questions. Warning: SPOILERS.Also  I really disliked this movie's central plot twist.Still, I have to give this movie a free pass. I simply can't give a negative review to a film during which I laughed and smiled throughout. This is a fun summer event-movie. It's a fast-paced, sci-fi actioner with fantastic special effects, the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and tons of fan service and Easter eggs. (Recreating the 1984 film's sequences shot-for-shot? C'mon! That was just cool and fun.)We've got nanobaddies, liquid metal terminators (made of mimetic polyalloy, to those of us in the know), aging T-800's with stiff joints, time machines, terminators arriving in multiple decades, Bot-on-Bot violence, a school bus flipping over on the Golden Gate Bridge and  somebody does something totally sweet with an oxygen tank. They really threw in everything but the kitchen sink for this movie. The result is only kid stuff, but it's still a good time. If you see this movie, and you don't smile when a T-1000 emerges from a police car windshield, then you have never been a 10-year-old boy.This year's ""Jurassic World"" had none of the earmarks of a great film, but it still entertained. I gave that a positive review, so I'm going to go head and recommend this as well.",Terminator Genisys
183,Mike_Devine,A metallic mess,4,5 July 2021,"Schwarzenegger's return to the series that launched his career as a bonafide action star is nothing short of a metallic mess. The takeaway here is that Alan Taylor's 'Terminator Genisys' tries too hard and ends up coming up short in virtually every department.The first issue is that Schwarzenegger (or ""Pops""?) is clearly just here for a paycheck, as nearly everything in 'Genisys' feels like a joke. It's obvious the feedback on the previous installment was that it was too serious and wooden, so there's a lot more comedy and one-liners built into the dialogue here. Unfortunately, it cheapens the core that made 'Terminator' into a series that resonated with audiences. Next, Jai Courtney is not necessarily a bad actor, but his interpretation of Kyle Reese feels inauthentic, and while Emilia Clarke tries to capture the feisty spirit of Sarah Connor, it's impossible to match Linda Hamilton in this regard. As for the fourth face of John Connor, Jason Clarke is pretty vanilla and does not bring much to the character.As for the general plot, 'Genisys' pretty much pretends that most of the other films never happened, which was probably intended to make it feel like a more coherent story, but instead it drums up way more confusion than audiences deserved. From the constant time-hopping to the necessary-but-wooden explanations of what's going on, there's just too much to follow here. The only real highlights are the shift in geography to a city other than LA and the much improved CGI (which is to be expected since the film was released 31 years after the first installment).'Terminator Genisys' proves that it's possible to take a strong franchise off track by messing with too many aspects of what made it great in the first place.",Terminator Genisys
184,James_De_Bello,6.5/10,6,14 July 2015,"You would be hard pressed to find a bigger lover of the first two terminator films and their mythology than me. I literally grew up with the films and have watched them uncountable times and still get a kick out of them, mostly because of how close I am to the interesting, fleshed out and layered characters it offers. This whole intro was to make a point: this new terminator movie really heavily relies on that and would have been a failure if the first two movies hadn't been some of the best ever made.I really cannot deny that I did have a thrilling experience and more often than not, when characters were in peril, I was clutching my seat. And as I said that is only thanks to how connected I am with them already and what was built around them had some very strong points. Firstly, Arnold: his performance, his back story, his presence all deliver good and memorable moments. Furthermore the terminator aspect makes again for some very good villains that really feel like something to be scared about, something that genuinely intimidates the characters. The call backs and scene recreations are all perfectly fit into the story and never felt out of place. Moreover, the story has its positive aspects in the fact that it does go places and put forward interesting ideas that somehow pay off and also combines parts of the themes explored by Cameron into this one and I must admit that they really engaged me, there wasn't a lot of it, but the idea of falling in love with someone you have never met, the relationship between Kyle and Sarah, the line between man and machine, the emotional connection a machine can have and finally the relationship between Sarah and the Terminator, were all parts that had relevance in the film, were treated respectfully and really fit the characters.Unfortunately that can't be said for the whole movie. Too many times Sarah and Kyle were totally out of character and were just transformed into some witty one-line braggers. It was a pain to see these two amazing characters fit only 50% of the time and be destroyed by studio notes and blockbuster dullness the rest of the time. I don't hate Jai Courtney, I find he to be a very serviceable actor that has just made some very wrong decisions and here he proves again that it isn't really his fault he isn't doing justice to his character. Of course a greater actor could have saved a part of it, but he still would have failed in the parts where Courtney failed. He and Clarke actually has a couple of very, very bright moments, but had more that fell flat. Same goes for Clarke, I think she is a good actress but again her character was just beaten into badness. The story doesn't make as much sense as it should, there are parts that really succeed but all in all it does more stupid messing up of canon than interesting twist. I repeat that the basic ground on which it starts is fascinating and there are storytelling ideas that really could be interesting, but it just doesn't know how to tie them up and fails miserably at doing it. The action is for the major part a mix of fast cutting and bloated CGI and never even for once matches the perfection of the first two films, even though I will say a couple of scenes has interesting visual ideas and were partially well developed.So there it is, thanks to the quality of T1 and T2 it is more good than bad and does go back to some of the core material that made Cameron's movies so thrilling and succeeds in making some of it's own really good and has Anrie back in prime form as we love him most, yet it totally falls short in brining the Terminator story onwards and that is confirmed by one of the most stupid end credit scenes I have ever seen.",Terminator Genisys
185,scottshak_111,Another franchise that plunges into mediocrity,7,3 July 2015,"If you have been following the Terminator saga closely, which as a matter of fact I have, and which of course is hard for people to keep track of given the humongous year gaps, you would be thrilled to see the beginning sequence of the movie. The untold prologue gets told. What James Cameron had hinted in the first installment gets displayed. But the question goes: was it perfect? What James Cameron had ignited long ago was a spark of sci-fi awesomeness. The cast then was stellar, their acting prowess unmatched! What Alan Taylor has with him is a bunch of renowned actors, some of them can't really plunge into the sentient topnotch emotions that the then Sarah, Kyle and Connor had sparked amidst the Skynet terror stricken world. (Daggers intended at Jai Courtney!) Genisys has a brilliant plot too, but unfortunately it negates everything James had built in his timeline. The time theory just gets trudged upon big time and little explanations of justification make things even more difficult to understand. If you aren't up to speed with the Terminator timeline, you might as well miss it.The powerful drama of the franchise gets lost into mediocrity. Gravity in the characters is nowhere to be found. There is no impending dread like there used to be. It fails to milk on hard-to-defeat robot fear factor.SPOILERS AHEAD: All that had happened in 'The Terminator' is made to rest in dust, as Sarah encounters another Arnie (whom she calls Pops, and boy does he behave like one!) in the year 1973, who had come to save her from a Skynet cyborg sent from the future just like the first installment. Now the meeting with Kyle Reese in the year 1984 happens but this time with an already prepped Pops (who knows everything about the future) and Sarah who intercept Kyle and kill Arnie from The Terminator. What is the next logical thing to do? Avoid the judgment day. So that is what Kyle and Pops are in for, but Kyle breaks in with a memory he had in the time machine saying they have to go to 2017 as that is when the judgment day was bound to happen and not 1997 (Kyle and Pops don't know that as they haven't seen T-2 :P). So what appears to be a recalcitrant Kyle coaxing Sarah to go to 2017 (that looks horrible btw) was basically based on a memory Kyle had. Trusting that they reach 2017 where Genisys aka Skynet is about to go live.What makes the story even more intricate is the fact that John Connor in the future gets affected by Skynet something that Kyle witnesses when he was about to time travel to 1984. The affected John Connor is then sent some years prior to 2017 to see to it that everything goes fine and that Genisys goes online without a hiccup (so primarily to stop Kyle and Sarah).Along with Kyle, Sarah time travels to 2017 only to find the future bad John and of course Pops still up and running. What follows are some brilliant action sequences in an effort to stop Skynet/Genisys from going live. But I know it's one hell of a hotchpotch. Things were simpler when there was only one timeline to follow.Jai seems literally absent with emotions. (Was he just chosen for the naked time travel scenes or was he really supposed to act?) He looked more cyborg than Pops! Emilia could have been a good Sarah, but sometimes it is really hard to read her. The Kyle and Sarah romance and the right chemical vibes are literally absent from the movie which makes it hard to relate to their commotion. Movie lacks profundity something that its predecessors had mastered. Arnold is showing too many expressions for a cyborg. The inclusion of J.K. Simmons looks dispensable. Jason Clarke doesn't look that great as John too.On the good side we have some pretty dope action scenes, like the one where Pops holds a T-1000 in the acid. Or when he rams a rotor into John, the bus action, and the final action bits that look pretty great. Other than that, mediocre!",Terminator Genisys
186,coreyjdenford,It's time for Genisys,4,3 July 2015,"This review will contain no spoilers. Terminator Genisys is action packed, hilarious and ludicrously wonderful. Starring Emilia Clarke as a bad-ass Sarah Connor and Arnold Schwarzenegger as the T-800 Terminator Genisys is filled with blistering action and a whole of thrills this should be at the top of your to see list. Here are some reasons on why I adored this film. 1. Bad-ass action: This movie is probably the most action-packed film I have seen this year and with it being better than the last installment of Terminator back in 2009 this is literally the bad-ass sequel to Terminator 2: Judgement day.2. Special Effects: The special effects in this film are one-of-a-kind because they are really pretty and really nicely done with the Terminators looking like real robots (from the future).3. The T-800: The T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is back and this time more bad-ass than ever and still stays up to his command to protect Sarah Connor. He does his duty to save the world from killing machines trying to take over the world.Yes this movie is very action packed and wonderful but there are a few flaws but I won't share them because like I said this will contain no spoilers. This movie is directed by Alan Taylor (Thor: The Dark World, 2014) and stars Jason Clarke (John Connor), Jai Courtney (Kyle Reese) alongside Emilia Clarke and Arnold Schwarzenegger. In my opinion though this is a must see from fans of Terminator. 9/10 and also fantastic in 3D. Must see film of 2015.",Terminator Genisys
187,kgprophet,Like Arnold - the Franchise is Getting Old,5,3 July 2015,"I was mildly surprised how competent this semi-reboot of the Terminator franchise was. The tepid reviews gave a dismal outlook. What I found was professional filmmaking putting all the required elements into making a popcorn movie. So it wasn't a question of IF the movie was an agreeable 2 hours of summertime diversion, but WHY we wanted to invest any more time into this franchise.Certainly not for Arnold. The filmmakers were smart enough to know this large budget film could not rely completely on Arnold to create a screen presence everyone wanted to see. He interacts occasionally with the story, but other times goes off screen. That leaves Kyle Reese as the male lead, and Jai Courtney, certainly a capable actor, does not ignite the screen. The female heavy, the young version of Sarah Connor, is the most dynamic of the bunch, and Emilia Clarke fills the shoes very well. As for the old Arnold, all we get from him is a father figure who basically seems to only care that the two eventually mate.The action has a few ground based chase scenes that have always been the highlight of previous Terminator films, although most people will probably groan at the unoriginal 'school-bus-on-the-Golden-Gate-bridge' set piece we've seen too many times (dating back to 1978's Superman). I felt there was too much CGI, which is a weird thing to say since Terminator 2 had everyone clamoring for more CGI. But I think the consensus of audiences these days is that CGI candy for the sake of being CGI is meaningless.In the few years since the previous film, there was plenty of time to come up with interesting story ideas. Perhaps too many. A few other recent films suffered under their weight of too many things going on (Interstellar, Tomorrowland). While it may act like a firework going off, where it temporarily propels the story, it does little in the long run to keep the audience engaged. In this case, almost all the available permutations are included (Arnie fights himself, Liquid Metal guy comes back, Judgement Day happens differently, expected good guy turns bad).I have to admit though, I didn't get bored. The direction wasn't bad, the dialogue could've been worse, Arnie stayed mostly in the background, the effects looked fine, and so on. But by the third act, it just becomes unavoidable that you are just rehashing the same mechanics of a Terminator story, and it seems inevitable that it gets tired. There just is no soul left in this franchise. I'm sure it's possible that this film will make a profit with international markets taking up the slack. But there is nothing more of interest for me.P.S... OMG who designed that AWFUL movie poster?!",Terminator Genisys
188,buckikris,Terminator Genisys: It's Not The Best Of The Series; But It's Not The Worst.,8,12 November 2015,"I'm a big fan of The Terminator Series, especially Terminator and Terminator 2. I did have my doubts about Terminator Genisys. I waited until it came out on Redbox and rented it. I was not disappointed at all, much better than I thought it would be. Terminator Genisys mixed a little bit of the original Terminator with it, when they go back to 1984. At first I thought it would be a rip off of Terminator; but I was so wrong. This movie is way better than Rise O The Machines; and I didn't even bother watching Terminator Salvation-T4. This movie when it comes to special effect mixes the effects from Terminator and Terminator 2, which makes it cool. To me this movie was about our obsession with computers/computer-devices. The result of what can happen if it ever gets out of hand, and would we be able to stop it. I read the negative reviews of this movie before I watched it. I ignored them because only you can decide if it's good nobody else can.",Terminator Genisys
189,tankace,A disappointment,6,13 March 2016,"The fifth movie in the terminator series had a lot going for good casting , the effects were looking good and the director was a qualified man for the job. So what happen and this one was one of the most boring and confusing movies I have seen in a long time. The point is that this movie tried to retell the well known story of how the Terminator Universe came into been ,which was from the get go a huge mistake and to add to that the way they do it made the movie look broken ,not like the 12 Monkeys , more like Amazing Spider-man 2 ,which in its on right is a disappointing film. Also Arnold as much as he was the best for the role of the terminator 3 decade ago, he is now close to 70,he can't be a convincing action hero any longer ,to put it simple.To summaries if you are fan the terminator series, do not see this one unless you want to confirm for yourself what I said.",Terminator Genisys
190,OttoVonB,Low Expectations Won't Save You,3,15 December 2015,"Terminator Genysis is not the worst movie you will ever see, not by a long shot. It often contains what could reluctantly be acknowledged as technical proficiency. It is not the worst movie of all time, but it certainly tries hard to be the stupidest, and is among the most cynical.Before we move on, we need to rewind, as befits the Terminator saga. With each installment, this originally streamlined story grows more needlessly complicated. The first one was a simple enough tale of a machine set back in time to kill its nemesis before he was born. Brilliant high-concept idea executed beautifully. Terminator 2 threw in a weird paradox we chose to all ignore (Skynet originates itself, which makes very little sense) but everything else was so perfect it hardly mattered. Terminator 3 tried to be a remake of Terminator 2, which is sad because its finest ideas, including a very bleak epilogue, were both original and scarce. Terminator Salvation could not have chosen a more unfortunate title and showed us how much « cooler » Black Hawk Down would have been with robots thrown in and now this.Terminator Genysis manages to be the worst offender because of three egregious sins (about to be repeated by the new Alien films, so sit tight, fans!): first, it erases « shameful » episodes by throwing parts 1 and 2 into a blender and creating a future exempt of parts 3 and 4. Second, it establishes a cinematic universe, promising future films only die-hard fans will be able to enjoy fully (if at all, as evidenced by this sad effort). Third, it shamefully exploits our nostalgia without even understanding the foundations of what made its inspiration great. The Terminator films are high-concept at its finest. How does this convoluted mess even relate? You need a full page and five flow-charts to summarize the plot, and it still doesn't make sense.« Genysis » - a landmark in, among many things, Hollywood's abusive relationship with spelling and the English language as a whole - falls flat on its face every time it evokes the older films, which is almost all the time. Every new thing it introduces is worthless and jars with the internal logic of the saga, every old thing it rehashes is recycled appallingly, starting with a woefully miscast Emilia Clarke and Jay Courtney. And, in true flop fashion, the best things about the film are the things that are NOT in the film, such as Grampa Terminator's decades-long undercover stint in the construction industry. It's a film that thinks it's smart and sophisticated, but isn't. A rehash of a seminal action classic which has nothing new to offer in the action stakes. If as much passion - however misguided - had been put into making this film as went into promoting it, not least by a baffling James Cameron, himself stuck in recycle mode until the end of time now, then perhaps we'd have something decent on our hands. But we don't.Find something else to do with those two hours of your life.",Terminator Genisys
191,Danny_G13,Messy and unnecessary,6,31 October 2015,"The Terminator franchise peaked at 2 and has been downhill since. 3 was average, 4 was solid but moving further away from the series' origins, and now this.In short, the biggest problems are two fold: 1: The time travel alternative timeline stuff just gives rise to inexplicable and implausible scenarios, with no explanation as to how they came about.2: Making a bad guy good worked astoundingly well between Terminators 1 and 2, but making essentially the hero of the whole franchise, John Conner, a bad guy, is the most idiotic design decision ever and undermines everything that went before.Add to that the appalling casting of the awful Jai Courteney who insulted the role of Kyle Reese compared with the brilliant Biehn and a rather contrived Arnie and essentially you have a rather flat end to the whole franchise.Admittedly unlike others I thought Emelia Clarke was quite well cast as Sarah, but I do agree the romance between her and Reese was borderline pathetic.In truth, it should have stopped after two, and yes, this film isn't absolutely terrible - it's just messy, unnecessary, and makes a hash of trying to tie up the story while bringing in things which don't blend on any level. Chinese T1000? Is it meant to be the same one Robert Patrick played? Who knows! This was just a silly way for the franchise to go out.",Terminator Genisys
192,asb_deutsch,Old but not obsolete- full popcorn fun-fare!,8,10 July 2015,"Genisys does not deserve the scorn it's been getting on the Internet. It does not deserve the universal panning it is receiving by critics. There still seems to be a bunch of people out there who like to point fingers for no reason.The only downfall is we are never quite sure which characters are human and which are robots. The lines between them have become blurred. ""Are youyou?"" one character plaintively asks someone, uncertain whether it is a flesh and blood person in front of her or a sinister simulacrum, made of metal and wires. What Terminator Genisys does is reset a narrative that was going nowhere and allows the series to go into new directions. Let's be honest with ourselves here; none of the Terminator movies, even T2, were perfect moviesAfter all is said and done, Terminator Genisys did its job. I was entertained, engaged, and excited about the possibilities it opened up. It felt fresh and gave a floundering franchise a much need jolt of energy.I would suggest you ignore the critics and determine for yourself whether Genisys is a much needed and enjoyable turn for the Terminator franchise, or another nail in its coffin. I say the former in stead of the latter, but that is just my opinion. After all, I could be wrong. I'm finally satisfied to have a solid, re-watchable sequel to T1 and T2.

It has badass Emilia Clarke in a leather jacket and combat boots which definitely sends me places. The CGI in this one is good and I couldn't mention John's character choices in the last movie review because it would have been a spoiler but they do play into this a bit more and explain his actions. Matt Smith does a great job as a side villain.This movie is essentially a reboot. It does have some nice fan service to the original though. This new revamped Sarah Connor is much more kick-ass and a strong independent woman type. Kyle is more of a side character in this one but I'm ok with that.There are obviously a few inconsistencies in this movie and a lot is unexplained and left open to interpretation. I don't really like how they don't explain how Pops is existing but I can look past it knowing it might be expanded on in Dark Fate.Overall I liked it but it doesn't hit the highs of the original 2.",Terminator Genisys

195,gavinp9,Fun and fast - better than the last two films in the series,8,2 January 2018,"'Terminator: Genisys' (or Terminator 5) is another sequel/prequel/reboot coming out in 2015 ('Jurassic World', 'Fantastic Four', 'Jungle Book', 'M:I5', 'Transporter Refueled', 'Vacation', etc. ), but it's a very well-made film with plenty to offer long-time fans and anyone looking for a good action film. The film starts in 2029 (i.e. after the events of 'Terminator: Salvation') and John Connor is now played by Jason Clarke, with Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese - technically his dad, since he's the guy in the first film that gets Sarah Connor (now Emilia Clarke) knocked up. It may take a little while to get your head around it, but the filmmakers are assuming you know some of the backstory!Basically, John & Kyle win the post-""Judgement Day"" war against the Terminators/SkyNet - which makes for an exciting opening 20min! - but not before a T-800 (Arnie) is sent back to 1984 to kill Sarah. This takes us full circle and we end up right where the first film starts! Pretty cool, but something's change in the timeline and old Arnie is (somehow) there to stop just-arrived Arnie. From there, it slowly starts to make sense and fit together - in a parallel-universes kind-of way - but it doesn't really detract from the story too much. The plot is pretty simple and the same as all the films - stop SkyNet, which involves lots of being chased, shooting, explosions and one-liners!JK Simmons is funny as a 'believer' and gets a few good scenes, but Arnie gets some great lines and moments, especially with his ""smiles""! But the main stars are Clarke & Courtney, who work well together and are both better than the actors that played them in the previous films. There's a little bit of seriousness at the end, but action/fun/set-pieces galore throughout - on the Golden Gate Bridge, in helicopters, in trucks... always moving and fighting!",Terminator Genisys
196,reb-warrior,"I gave it a chance, but no.",4,11 July 2016,"Jai Courtney was horribly miscast. John Connor comes from a future of destruction and starvation. Michael Bien, whom originated the role was wiry muscular and looked even a bit malnourished. He fit the role. Jai looks like a well fed football player. He must still be on his Spartacus routine and diet. I liked him in that. His acting here is uninspired.Emilia Clarke brought nothing special to the role. I kept feeling like she was TRYING to be bad-ass, but just wasn't succeeding. She's no Linda Hamilton. I want to add with respect to the actors, that I think the roles COULD be played by new actors, but that these two were badly miscast.Arnold's ""Pops"" was humorous at times but mainly lame. JK Simmons was wasted here. Oh, and nice armor the humans had in the future. In the original, the human rebels were a ragtag and scrappy bunch.There were a couple twists from the original and a new angle. But guess what? I didn't care, because they were lame, the overall story was stupid and boring, and the dialog was as if junior high kids wrote it.The original Terminator movie was serious. No comedy. No jokes. It was serious, romantic, and tragic, with moody broody characters, and lots of action. It believed in itself and succeeded because of that. What a wasted franchise. There's so much potential for more stories, but they keep ruining it.I don't recommend if you're a fan of the first two Terminator movies. If you've never seen any of the Terminator movies, you may like it. I gave it a 4 out of 10.",Terminator Genisys
197,thebricks,Very good movie but Terminator fans are weird and hard to please,9,29 April 2018,"Terminator 3 and Genisys were great, 2 and 4 were actually the weaker films of the series. 2 was a total rehash of the first, which was a great movie. I'm not really sure why this film got a lot of flak. I can only speculate it's from people who came in wanting to trash this movie and not give it a chance. Not sure what these people are expecting.The TV show was probably the worst, but because it's TV, people force themselves to like it, for some weird reason. Reminds me of Westworld, but I'll save my thoughts on that for another review.Sadly, because of the way this movie was received by the hardcore Terminator fans, and the way others were received, they cannot finish this series and move on, which is just a shame. James Cameron approved of this movie, and all the fans could say was, ""he was paid off!"" I'm sorry, I've seen Cameron's other movies; he's a hack when it comes to storytelling, but because he excels at special effects, everyone overlooks that. I think a part of the problem with the Alien and Terminator sequels is that everyone tries to judge them based on Cameron's movies, but the fact is, he can't tell a story, so when viewers watch a movie like Genisys that has an involved, deep plot, they turn against it.

If you're a fan of the Terminator franchise you will love love love this. John Connor......the son of Sarah Connor......sends Kyle Reese back to 1984 to protect his mother. You think you've seen this before, and well yes, you kind of have, but the 1984 we visit this time is not quite right, and Sarah Connor is not quite as she should be. You need to cast your mind back to the very first Terminator and dig up the basic plot from your memory, I'm not sure if this film will make 100% of sense if you are not familiar with what has come before......or after. Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a welcome return and his character blunders along in it's usual brilliant way, looking human but not quite getting the mannerisms right. Sarah Connor, played by Emilia Clarke, is a good sturdy character, they have brought her right up to date without changing her basic values. Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is a soldier's soldier, brought up the hard way and determined to fight for what he believes in.

200,troyputland,"Entertaining, but infuriating.",6,22 July 2015,"The major question that needs answering regarding Terminator Genisys is 'where does it fit in with the other films?'. It has thrown the series completely out of whack. Schwarzenegger hasn't hidden the truth that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and Terminator Salvation are now null and void due to the path that the filmmakers has chosen. Some overlapping occurs with James Cameron's Judgment Day (film 2). A new time-line has formed, with Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney, Michael Biehn in the first film) going back in time to stop Judgment day from happening. Events that follow differ from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) is different. T-900 is older. They're aware of Reese's arrival, and of an alternative future. Kyle is baffled, as are most of us. Nothing makes much sense. This alternate reality has neither the intelligence or shock value of Star Trek. How is it that Sarah Connor's (a lot) younger and the T-900 (Schwarzenegger) is made to look older if a small amount of time has passed since T:JD? These question leave me deeper in to the land of confusion. Starting from the beginning would help. Connor, Reese and her robot companion set off on a mission to destroy Genisys (known to us previously as Skynet). Clarke, although cherished in her role in Game of Thrones, struggles as the leading girl. Sarah's allegedly cold and hard but half the time we get cheese and stale bread. Courtney and Schwarzenegger impress, but even their performances are softened by a timid age rating (12A). Genisys is a mess, an annoyingly, enjoyable money-making mess.",Terminator Genisys

For casting, Schwarzenegger delivers again - he is really a strong comedian given the right scenes. I'm not so sold on the new Sarah Conner. I think she was picked because she resembles Jennifer Lawrence. She's OK, but lacks the musculature of the original Sarah. The new Kyle Reese was awesome, and the new John Conner did an OK job too.The plot again all revolves are the machines trying again, relentlessly, to make it to Judgment Day, and there is a something there that involves Genysis.

205,Tromafreak,"Entertaining, despite raping the franchise",6,23 July 2015,"Where do I begin? There's just so much to like and dislike about this one. It's difficult to form an opinion. First and foremost, this fifth installment (and semi-remake) of the Terminator franchise is a fun, action-packed movie which does try to give the Terminator fans everything they've wanted since 1991's Terminator 2. Well, it didn't exactly work out that way. Although, I think we can all agree that Genisys makes up for the dull, lackluster flop that was Salvation. But this one has its own problems. But one big problem they both have in common. a PG-13 rating. So, once again, we're stuck with a Terminator movie which lacks the bleak, apocalyptic tone of the first two. As well as realistic profanity, decent violence and Arnold's ass. You can't have everything. But a fun movie nonetheless. But what we have here is a movie which was designed to cash in on a (hopefully) dying reboot trend, and at the same time, attempt to not alienate the longtime Terminator fans. Technically, Termintor Genisys is a remake of the original movie. Yet, events from that movie are referenced. Therefore, this movie is no reboot.With the exception of Salvation, all past Terminator movies are based on time travel. Yet, time travel was never a big part of the story. In this one, it is. In Genisys, we begin with what looks to be the end of the war against the machines, in 2029. The human race has defeated Skynet, who makes one last attempt at saving itself. It sends a T- 800 back to 1984. A time before John Connor was born. This T-800 has been programmed to track down and destroy John Connor's mother to be, Sarah Connor, which would erase John's existence all together. Erasing all he's done to take Skynet down. John Connor and the resistance learn of this attempt, and must quickly decide what to do. It's decided to send one of their soldiers, and John's good friend Kyle Reese, into the past to locate and hopefully destroy the T-800 and save Sarah, thus saving John, and all their progress. Sound familiar? Sure, it does. But this is where things get complicated.Later on, in the future, there has been more time travel. Terminators have been sent back about a decade before the events of the first movie. A T-1000 has killed Sarah's parents. And before it can get to her, a T-800 is sent by an unknown person to rescue Sarah, and to remain her guardian up until the events of the first movie. This T- 800 who's known as ""pops"", is also training Sarah into the badass bitch we remember from T2. Okay. Well, not exactly THAT Sarah. But damn, she's hot. The point is, the Sarah Connor Kyle is expecting no longer exists, as well as the 1984 we remember from the original movie. Everything's changed. The events of the original movie, as well as everything that happened afterwards, is gone. Or I guess it still exists somewhere in another timeline. Although, I doubt it even matters because regardless of how things go in this movie, I'm pretty sure we'll never get to see how things ended up in the original timeline. Which is one of my biggest gripes about this movie.Pops has long since filled Sarah in on how things originally played out, including the T-800 sent back to 1984, as well as the fact that Kyle is to be the father of her unborn child. But with this knowledge, and plenty of time to prepare, things can potentially go a lot smoother this time around. And for a while, it does. Sarah, and Pops, who has aged drastically since 1974, quickly take out the T- 800 before he has a chance to kill anyone. And soon, they catch up with Reese, who has ran into a much bigger problem than he expected. A T-1000 has found him, and is about to end him before an interesting twist of fate where he is saved by Sarah Connor. After lengthy discussion, filling Kyle in on exactly what the hell is going on, together, the three of them (a little too) easily dispose of the T-1000 in a very fun little scene. Well, that was easy. What next? Well, Pops has been working on a time machine, which can now be completed using the chip from the T-800. Sarah and Kyle go to the year 2017 to stop Judgement Day. But what they discover when they get there, none of us expected. That us, unless you watched the trailer and had it spoiled like pretty much everyone did.One of the low points for me, besides the lack of violence/profanity is the new John Connor and Reese. I can live with this new John because every one of these movies has featured a different one. But the new Kyle doesn't remind me of the original even a little bit. On the other hand, the choice made to replace Linda Hamilton with Game Of Thrones's Emilia Clarke, was a wise one. She actually does look a little like Hamilton. Nice, big lips and all. She's great. Really, she is. But she's kind of portrayed as a know-it-all wise ass, who provides most of the cute one-liners. Yeah. I really miss the T2 version of Sarah. But it's not so bad. Like I said. she's got them nice, big lips. Ultimately, Terminator Genisys is enjoyable if you don't put too much thought into what they've done to the story, or compare it to the first 2 installments. Instead just be grateful they didn't pick up where they left off with Salvation. A movie so unpopular that a new beginning has been forced upon us. But hey! We've got Arnold back, as well as Sarah. Kyle Reese lives, and Nick Stahl is nowhere to be found. And despite raping the franchise, Genisys is okay with me. 6/10",Terminator Genisys
206,luke-a-mcgowan,"Just think of it as a standalone. Its still not great, but its an accessible action film with Schwarzenegger always in good form",4,12 September 2015,"There are some movies you can wind up enjoying but the whole time you are picking out everything you hate about it. Terminator Genisys is a very accessible movie and it does a lot well and right, but there are so many things I hated about it that it just can't be a positive review. I'll be down for watching Arnold Schwarzenegger play the Terminator forever. He's pushing 70 and he's still one of the best action stars whose ever lived. I'd watch him over Paul Rudd's Ant-Man every day of the week. He is also still really funny - as one example, the mental picture he paints of him waiting thirty years, working in construction (""until I got laid off"") and reading gunsandammo.com articles was a surprisingly light and funny moment in amongst all the seriousness. I thought Jai Courtney was my favourite part of this film. He's an above- average action star, he had good chemistry with both Clarkes and Schwarzenegger (I liked the dad-boyfriend dynamic) and his deadpan ""I use it to find my keys"" was my biggest laugh of the movie. His reactions are not unbelievable - look the guy isn't DeNiro, but he's fine - and I felt that he was more than capable of holding the role of Kyle Reese. I was certainly rooting for him all film. Jason Clarke is an all right John Connor (I preferred Bale) but there's a few nuances that I enjoyed - a shadow of a look on his face when future Kyle is talking about ""after the war"". JK Simmons steals the show as a conspiracy theory obsessed cop who always seems to be bumbling around.I cannot say the same for Emilia Clarke. Look, she's very nice to look at, but I hated this casting choice. Maybe she would have done a better job if she'd been able to play Vulnerable Sarah and Badass Sarah (just like Linda Hamilton) across two movies, but when she rolls on in, guns blazing and shouting ""MOVE SOLDIER!"" I was selling the movie so fast that the stock market crashed. One of the reasons I've rapidly stepped back from Game of Thrones is the way that Clarke (helped by directors like Alan Taylor, by the way) has tried to steer Danaerys, the typical teenage girl, into this feminist GIRL POWUH character. Its ruining Danaerys and it ruined Sarah Connor. As far as I'm concerned, whoever Clarke was in this movie was not Sarah Connor. She doesn't seem to be trying very hard either - there was so much depth they could have done in this film, delving into the fact that she hasn't had a real relationship with a human in almost twenty years, but instead all I can think about is that people in 1984 didn't say ""like"" the way they do in present day.The screenplay of this movie was probably the worst part. Where to begin? There is the smearing of classic lines (the placement of ""come with me if you want to live!"" may have given me an STD). There's the cheesy new ones. There's inconsistencies (if you're going to make Sarah a feminist, at least stick with it! Don't cut to the cheesy lines wooing her like two scenes later!) There's plot holes by the bucketload (too many to list!) But there's some great moments in there too. There's some nice elements, some good quips and the fact that a movie this complicated was as accessible as it was means that at least one person was doing their job.I need to pause here and talk about the John Connor element of this story. Its fairly obvious that this was going to tick a lot of people off. But putting it in the trailer was probably the worst possible idea that anyone has had in the history of making trailers. If people hate the decision, at least it comes as a twist. I love a good reveal, and watching the scene where Connor's transformation is revealed had so much potential. Sure a lot of people would have still been angry, but Genisys guaranteed a lose-lose situation by spoiling the twist for those who might have dug it.Alan Taylor was probably not the person for this job. He's one of those TV directors who has absolutely no identity of his own. He's ""oh that guy"". He directed that one episode I liked, maybe. He knows how to do action scenes well, but at others I just think ""what the hell?"" Some of the films tonal shifts are utterly bizarre. Late in the film Sarah, Kyle and Pops are arrested and photographed to the raucous ""Bad Boys"" song, which made me laugh really hard but seriously, what? The element of dread is also completely missing from this film - mostly because John Connor's Terminator does a lot of talking but not much killing, and both Sarah and Kyle do way too good a job at holding him at bay. I hold Taylor responsible for a lot of this film's bizarrely messy action sequences - moments like Kyle Reese shouldering a car, John Connor pulling a helicopter out of nowhere, and a showdown in the hospital which ultimately goes completely unresolved. However, the final battle was really pulse-pounding and one of the only positive aspects of erasing the timeline, because the fates of all characters are now in play. I didn't have the ""urgh, we know you're going to survive"" feeling that I have with pretty much all Marvel movies, which is always a win. A lot of people are going to be cross at this film's erasing of the other films from the continuity. As far as I'm concerned, this is just a standalone, somewhat messy film that was fairly good fun to watch. Don't overthink it. Just rewatch T2 instead and remember the good old days.",Terminator Genisys
207,theromanempire-1,The best terminator since the judgment day (part 2),10,2 July 2015,this was the best since part 2 and it's really a reboot which is a retelling of the first 3 films as it reffers to things happened in first two films mostly but also part 3 is not completely ignored.only salvation is ignored.A fresh new take with arnold at his best and the action and suspense are constant and u never get bored.the new sara connor is very beautiful and talented and u like kyle and john too.there are twists and all in all if u are a fan of those films u will love this one which is a great improvement over the previous salvation film which was the worst terminator film even worst than part 3.the only flaw in the film is that it repeats the same terminator formula which after 4 films may get u tired but that was to be expected.The film was excellent and that counts the most.,Terminator Genisys
208,adampkalb,A lot better than the first two!,8,12 May 2016,"Warning! Spoilers ahead! I didn't find the 3rd film Rise of the Machines to be as interesting as the first 2, and it was cool to see the future war in Salvation, even though it wasn't what I was used to in the Terminator films. But I agree with James Cameron and other people who say that this film helped reinvigorate the franchise.First of all, I found it to be a great new story to have that was back to what I was sort of familiar with, but also have the amazing twist happen for this new story that John Connor became evil. True, it was also going against everything he stood for like Lisa Simpson in Lisa Goes Gaga, but at least there was actually a good reason for that in the story. It actually seemed like a good new story to have even after Salvation where the people at Skynet turned John Connor evil because they knew he was the only thing that got in their way. I also liked how they explained the new time line when it turned out that Sarah grew up with the T-800 that came back to save her in 1973 and I was really surprised when he suddenly showed up to stop the T-800 from the beginning of the first movie when it almost looked like it would be the same film again. My most favorite part is that Kyle didn't die to save Sarah like he did in the first movie and I'm so glad that they got to have the life that they wanted together in 2017.Second, I also liked how they managed to up the action scenes with the bus on the Golden Gate Bridge and when Sarah and Kyle almost fell and when the T-800 fought John Connor in the climax.Third, I thought it was kind of interesting how they incorporated their new Genisys story with our technology from today when it was an app taking over everyone's mobile devices and that's how Skynet planned to take over in this movie with Judgement Day being 2 years after this movie was released and how the Dyson family from the 2nd movie was involved in this again. I know, that's probably the least fascinating thing that I have to say here, but you gotta admit, J.K. Simmons's cameo as O'Brien was still pretty funny.Why all the hate against this film? I think its IMDb rating really belongs between 8 and 9 with the first 2 Terminator movies.",Terminator Genisys
209,badajoz-1,Arnie saves this poor reboot,3,20 July 2015,"If Arnold Schwartzenegger were not in this movie, it would be truly awful. He provides the context, background, affection, and nostalgia for past efforts - except the truly ludicrous T4! He and his cyborg remain the rock solid foundation of the franchise, showing other younger actors that they are trying too hard or simply are not good enough. The two main younger male stars are frankly a waste of space with no gravitas or presence to warrant their participation, while Emilia Clarke just about passes muster as the young girl too mature for her years on the edge of crying 'help' throughout. But, no, this is 2015, only kick ass girls allowed!!!!!!!!!!!!! And this is where the trouble with the movie begins. The movie has several multi-dimensional timelines which are impossible to follow, so changes pop up all the time, and we have to wait around as an audience as some tawdry attempt at explanation is made. it is all too much and far too confusing. So much so, as soon as you start to think 'what a load of rubbish,' up pops the next action, bang, wallop sequence is thrown at you.Yes, awful script, unmemorable performances, lazy direction all lead to a fifth rate film, but good ol' Arnie he keeps you watching and remembering when fun and fright with the old 'Terminator' worked so brilliantly.",Terminator Genisys
210,patriciogl10,"Flawed pretty much in all places, yet manages to entertain.",6,16 December 2019,"At some point one inevitably must think that all these Terminator films are just re-hashes of the first two legendary films. More of the same but with minor unimpressive twists that ridiculously challenge sci-fi logic in a most absurd fashion. Casting proved to be flawed, as none of the actors seem right for their parts, even though they try their best and convey somewhat a dignified portrayal, which is simply not enough. Emilia Clarke brings her young vibrant Sarah Connor to life decently. Arnold does what he does best, and Jason Clarke in my opinion delivers a more passable John Connor than, let's say, Christian Bale.At some point, sadly we must come to terms with Terminator films being over, because if Hollywood continues to extend this franchise putting out unimaginative and uninspired efforts such as this, they are going to end up destroying it irreparably for good. So, unless they bring creative and talented minds to work, they should just let Terminator die.So why a 6 rating? I really can't say I was bored throughout the film, I was mildly entertained, which for these kind of films is probably the number one objective, so it succeeded in that.",Terminator Genisys
211,Jerghal,The Terminator franchise has run it's course,7,20 July 2015,"After 3 weeks Genisys was already banned to the smallest theaters in the Cinema Complex which is a clear indication of it's success or lack thereof...and after having seen it in myself I can see why. Genisys tries to reconnect with T1 en T2, in the beginning of the film even complete scenes are recreated and there are plenty of references and winks to these previously mentioned movies which doesn't seem like a bad start. But as the movie progresses it begins to stumble and fall. The story is messy and convoluted and lot's of stuff that happens that feels random and just made up as they went along by the writers. Also throwing Shrawzie back in there..I don't know. It all feel forced, the humor is a bit funny but also very awkward sometimes. T4 tried to take the story in another direction, expand the universe and not simply redo the T1/T2 Connor/Reese story. Genisys tries both but they should have written a better script. Lot's of talent is dumped on this film in the hope that something brilliant will come out but newsflash: it doesn't work like that. The director has done lot's of good series (The Sopranos, Mad Men, Game of Thrones etc) and Emilia Clarke does an okay job (well as good as you can work with the written material I guess) and Shwarzie is himself, but older eh. Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese, on the other hand. Can't stand the actor. Anyone remember he did Die Hard 5? That sucked. Well this actor always sucks. They also tried to get Christian Bale back as Connor but he couldn't because of scheduling reasons so they got Jason Clarke instead, also not a stellar actor. T5 should first and foremost be an action movie but there are to many dead moments when the pacing falls flat. The VFX are sometimes great and sometimes awful and fake (helicopter scene). The sets and environments feel uninspired and are hardly memorable which causes a lack of atmosphere. The film sometimes doesn't even feel like a Terminator movie. T2 also had a brilliant score by Brad Fiedel that kept a pacing/pushing the film while Genisys seems to lack noticeable music and if you do notice it, it seems a poor ripoff of Brad's score. Conclusion: the Terminator franchise feels old and tired much like Arnold's T-800. It really feels like there is nowhere left to take it anymore although Paramount means to make 2 more movies before 2019 when the rights go back to James Cameron. Speaking of which, Cameron endorsed this film as the official third movie in the series but personally I think he to is getting old coz it's nowhere near the quality standard of T1 or T2. As a Terminator fan you're gonna see it anyway but the poor box-office performance seems to indicate that the franchise has run it's course.",Terminator Genisys

If you look closer Mr. James Cameron finished the franchise in the second. And many tried to re boot it twice creating spectacular failures. The third however is another same scenario film that establishes the same losing streak.

213,Chalice_Of_Evil,Time travel makes my head hurt...,7,3 July 2015,"Old Arnie in this movie says alternate timelines aren't complicated, and there's certainly a lot going on here, so if you're not paying attention to the plot, you may think otherwise. For those who hated this movie as soon as it was announced that it was being made, do yourselves (and everyone else) a favour and pretend it doesn't exist (sparing us the complaining). Those who pre-judged this movie won't change their opinion, no matter what. If you love the original, but are unwilling to accept any other version, then just cry yourself to sleep whilst hugging your DVD of it. For those willing to at least give this movie a chance, you might find that the film - as its own interpretation - is quite enjoyable. One thing's for sure - it's better than the last two Terminator films, I think most would agree. Yes, there are lots of references to the past films (quotes, various scenarios, a T-1000 and the original T-800), and while the trailer relied upon those, the film itself does make efforts to change things/differentiate itself from what has come before. Really, if the trailers could've shown a bit less and left *some* surprises, though, would've been nice. What the film has going for it? Well...Arnie's back in all his deadpan quippy glory, for one. And not just a CGI'd version ala Terminator Salvation - although there's a bit of that too, featuring his original younger self from the first film. The effects on display are pretty good (definitely better than in Salvation) and he's not overused. Having the actual Governator himself present helps a lot, as nothing beats the real thing. Seeing Old Arnie (who is in fact 'new' Arnie) duke it out with Young Arnie (who, ironically, is now 'old' Arnie) is quite something to witness. Maybe it's less confusing to just call him 'Guardian', as he's credited in the movie as such. Although he's also known as 'Pops' by Sarah Connor. Speaking of, Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke is another tick in the win column for this movie. She isn't the Sarah Connor everyone (including Kyle Reese) is familiar with...but that's not a BAD thing. So she's not meek and afraid all the time - this is a GOOD thing. She can handle herself in a fight, why can't that be appreciated? Only the Thrones fans who have a big ol' hate-on for Daenerys Targaryen for no good reason (seriously, you hate her more than all the rapists and child murderers in that show? Really??), those who can't accept a woman taking charge or anyone but Linda Hamilton in the role, are likely the ones who'll have a problem with her. Emilia Clarke proved herself enough in the first season of the show that she became known for (something some people seem to have forgotten quickly), and here she proves herself more than capable of filling the shoes of both Hamilton and Thrones co-star Lena Headey in the iconic role too, reaching a happy medium between the two previous portrayals. Her Sarah is no pushover, doesn't wait around for Kyle Reese to save her and has a good character arc about choosing her destiny. Clarke plays well off Arnie (they have a nice dynamic) and conveys Sarah's vulnerable side, while also showing she's comfortable in a more action-oriented role than usual and, like Arnie, is capable of some deadpan one-liners/humour (the funniest being poking fun at her own height). The biggest controversy seems to be regarding the casting of Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese. Again, if you can't accept anyone but the original, then move along. Michael Biehn's Reese was definitely one of a kind, and no one's disputing that, but there were times I felt he was a bit overwrought, and Jai Courtney doesn't try to replicate this. He makes this interpretation of Reese his own. He thinks he knows what's going on, but in a way trades places with Sarah, ending up the confused one who doesn't know what the hell's going on - which is a nice role reversal. While Reese doesn't get along great with the other two in the beginning, through the course of the movie they develop an interesting dynamic. Courtney plays off both Clarke and Schwarzenegger well, as he does with Jason Clarke's John Connor (who we know too much about thanks to the trailers) at the start of the film. This connection between them proves important to the storyline's later developments. Byung-hun Lee has the cold steely glance Robert Patrick perfected in T2, but in the end proves rather superfluous. The screen time of Doctor Who's Matt Smith (for some reason being credited as Matthew Smith) amounts to little more than a cameo.There's plenty of CGI on display - which is part of the issue a lot of people seem to be having with the film, but let's not forget that while practical effects/animatronics can sometimes be the better option, other times they just...aren't (for some cringe-worthy examples, look no further than the original film. Not to knock what the first two movies achieved, as on the whole, the practical stuff worked, but were some instances where it really didn't). On the other hand, for truly bad CGI, just look to various scenes in T3. Thankfully, things have improved immensely since then, and it shows here. For those wanting an entertaining action movie, then this should deliver. For those hoping for something completely different to the original movies...what were you expecting? This film takes what we already know in a new and interesting direction. If you're longing for the original movies, then pull out your DVDs and rewatch them for the hundredth time, but if you're after a new interpretation, then keep an open mind and go into this film without any preconceived notions. You may be surprised.",Terminator Genisys

GENISYS IS EXCELLENT, TERMINATOR DARK FATE TOTALY DESTROYS THE FRANCHISE & IT CAN NEVER RECOVER FROM IT.
Genisys has superb action & cgi effects, of course its an action movie T2 is an action movie & T1 is an action MOVIE, if the financial backing & cgi effects James Cameron had in 91 were available in 84 T1 would have been an even bigger action movie, it wasn't Shakespeare for goodness sake, Cameron bought the rights to a short story about a cyborg travelling back in time he juiced it up rewrote the characters and hey presto he gave us the terminator pretty much the same way stallone did with rambo.
The terminator trilogy was done it's been played out the only way forward now is to either remake it or reboot it, like it or not that's the only way to keep the franchise going & Genisys is just about the best way to start a new trillogy of movies without destroying the old, it keeps all the characters from the original to play out new story's, obviously you can't keep all the original actors so you have to cast new ones, but as I said this is now done & dusted because the new movie takes a huge dump all over the franchise & burys it for good using awful characters, a totally rubbish plot & some of the worst cgi I've ever seen & action sequences so over the top it makes the fast & furious movies look like go cart racing",Terminator Genisys

Did John Connor sudden gained weight? If they were to bring Schwarzenegger back as the terminator, why not Ed Furlong as John Connor? Arnold Schwarzenegger was very weak as a terminator. First of all; why the stupid name Pops? When you look at Schwarzenegger as a terminator and a endoskeleton terminator, there is a huge difference. Schwarzenegger does not know how to be a robot anymore. Something he knew in the first two movies. Emilia Clarke (is she related to Jason Clarke?) just cannot surpass the performance of Linda Hamilton.The story is weird. From time to time it seems very inventive, but then again it does make any sense. How did the terminator end up with Sarah Connor when she was nine years old? Who sent him back? How was it why a Korean T-1000 was sent back to the past and not the American one from the second movie? Don't get me wrong, I liked J.K. Simmons' performance as O'Brien. But why did they not choose for Robert Patrick to be this character? The movie had great action, beautiful cgi but not the heart and soul of great actors and actress that the first movie had. If the movie makers learn how to bring together a perfect cast like the second movie, the terminator movie of 2017 can be called Terminator revived.

If I could transformers and this on my television and play them at the same time, I wouldn't be able to tell much of a difference. The sad thing is that it's written by the same people who wrote Shutter Island and Drive Angry two really great films. This sequel doesn't make a lick of sense has some of the worst acting in the entire franchise, Jai Courtney as Kyle Resse!Really freaking Really?! It recons everything that made the first two films so good and has so many damn plot holes that I'm surprised none of the actors fell in one. Here's the thing that pisses me off the most about this movie, before the movie opens with the credits it shows that is ignoring everything from Terminator 3 and Salvation, so it's the true sequel to Terminator 2, which means the only thing this film can recon are the two masterpieces that everyone loves! WHY? It's a spit in the face to entire fanbase and I really want to know how much money they paid James Cameron to actually say he liked this pile of garbage.

I don't love that film and I sure as hell don't think it holds a candle to Terminator 1 or 2, but was hell of a lot more enjoyable than this. Terminator Genisys just rehashes everything that we loved, horribly I might add, while changing all of it to show that none of it really mattered.

This is about the 5th installment of the Terminator Franchise so I didn't expect much, but if you are in the mood for an Action movie, it will satisfy your entertainment desires.There is plenty of cool action sequences, and surprisingly, the movie has an emotional aspect to it like the original two classics. However, nothing can compare to the first 2 in quality overall. There are a couple of scenes where they ""drop the ball"" in cannon to the original movies, but I guess if it was for a few laughs, you can't complain much. There were some really funny scenes in it, and Arnold has his ""one liners"", which was good to see.Emilia Clarke does a good job despite having to live up to high expectations.

However like Salvation it's one of the weaker ones but I do enjoy this one slightly more.Being a sequel but kind of a soft Reboot of the franchise this has an interesting story that changes and pays some homage to the first two films.
I really like the ideas this one brings with the Timeline being altered and everything changes it adds something different to the series.I also really like the John Conner terminator that was an interesting and unique idea for the franchise.However like Salvation I do have issues with this one the acting isn't great Emilia Clark was miscast as Sarah Conner in my opinion Iike her but she doesn't suit this character.
Jai Courtney as Kyle Reece is OK but nothing special.Arnie is great in this one as always he suits this character so much and he plays it to perfection.
Jason Clarke is really good as John Conner and is a great villian. However The T1000 is a little waisted in this one bit dissapointing.However solid action and a unique idea with the time travel element and an altered Timeline really safe this one and make slightly better than Salvation.Verdict 7.5/10 a fun action film and a unique premise that adds something new some mediocre acting makes one of the more weaker ones but still fun.",Terminator Genisys
223,CleveMan66,"""Terminator: Genisys"" is a little too complicated and not original enough, but it's still a lot of fun.",7,3 July 2015,"This review is for everybody. Usually, I write reviews mainly for people who haven't seen the movie yet. I stay away from spoilers, but try to give readers enough information, insight and analysis to allow them to make an informed decision on whether to see the movie. This review, however, is also for people who have seen the movie and aren't totally sure they understand all of it (much like me before I did my post-movie viewing homework). So, I've boned up on my ""termin-ology"" (as a fellow movie fan called it) and I've done more than my usual amount of pre-writing research. I am now prepared to tell you about ""Terminator: Genisys"" (PG-13, 2:05) and give you some spoiler-free insights and my evaluation. As always, I hope to inform, entertain and tell you what you need to know in order to decide whether this movie is worth your time and money. Ready? I hope so, because this is some complicated s---- (stuff).This fifth film in the ""Terminator"" franchise briefly takes us back to the beginning and then forges a bold new path all its own. Going through all the back story of the previous four films would take way too much space, so if you haven't seen at least the 1984 original, I would humbly suggest that you read my previous article about that movie - or just google ""The Terminator"". The first film gives you all that you really need to know (although knowing about ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" would help a bit too), but ""Terminator: Genisys"" does start with a short narration and a few key scenes to orient the uninitiated.As this film begins, it's the year 2029 and the human resistance, led by the seemingly omniscient John Connor (Jason Clarke), is on the verge of defeating the seemingly omniscient (and omnipresent and omnipotent) Skynet operating system and finally winning the war against the machines. Then, just before they experience that hard-earned victory, Skynet sends a T-800 cyborg back in time to 1984 to terminate Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke – no relation to Jason), John's mother, before he can be born and, thus, retroactively defeat the resistance. Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney), one of John's closest comrades-in-arms, volunteers to follow the Terminator back to 1984 and save Sarah. Just as Kyle has become suspended in the machine's magnetic field, Kyle sees something happening that changes everything.Kyle has been caught in a nexus of two alternate timelines – and he has visions/memories of both. When he arrives in 1984 Los Angeles, he finds a Sarah Connor who is radically different from the seemingly helpless waitress played by Linda Hamilton in the first film. This Sarah Connor is a tough, knowledgeable and resourceful warrior in waiting and SHE saves Kyle. But she has help – in the form of a T-800 terminator, played, as in the first three movies, by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sarah refers to this T-800 as her ""Guardian"" and she calls him ""Pops"". Kyle is frightened and confused, but he adjusts. After a cool shot-for-shot re-enactment of some scenes from the first film, the three of them have to fend off a liquid metal T-1000 terminator (Lee Byung-hun) before they can use a time machine that Pops built to travel through time together(!) and try (again) to save humanity from Skynet and its killing machines.The problem now is deciding which timeline is the right one to guide their efforts. Sarah has been taught by Pops that Skynet becomes self-aware and nukes most of mankind in 1997 – Judgment Day. Kyle has to convince her that there is now a different timeline, based on what happened as he was leaving 2029, and that 2017 is now the year that things go incredibly bad for humanity. In the new timeline, Skynet achieves dominance by using a Trojan horse called ""Genisys"". (No, not the old gaming system. Don't blame Sega.) Genisys is going to link all electronics on the planet (kind of like the Cloud on steroids) at a set moment. Our three heroes need to get to it after it's invented, but before it goes online. During the events that follow, much like the T-800 in ""Terminator 2"", a character changes sides, we meet Miles Dyson (Courtney B. Vance) and his son Danny (Dayo Okeniyi), while J.K. Simmons shows up in a very cool role. Basically, the movie has plenty of action, danger, explosions, gun play and mind-bending twists.The problem with ""Terminator: Genisys"" is that we've seen most of the terminator technology and human-cyborg fighting before, while the aspects of the plot that are new are almost too complicated. The key words in that last sentence are ""most"" and ""almost"". The screenplay by Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier, combined with Alan Taylor's direction, gives a fresh coat of paint to the old barn and keeps the square dancers moving. (I don't know why I just jumped to a country analogy, but I did and it's done.) The plot twists and dueling timelines are a bit difficult to follow, but you can do it if you're a big fan of the series, really smart, you surf the web for some post-viewing intel, or some combination thereof. Honestly, it's kind of fun to think about the new time-travel possibilities – and to try figuring out the answers to a few questions that the movie intentionally leaves unanswered.Whether you like having deep thoughts about this film or not, you'll probably enjoy the action, the actors and the accent (welcome back, Ahnold)! Remember how far away 1997 sounded when they discussed it in the 1984 film? I wonder how odd it might feel when it's after 2029 and we re-watch ""Terminator: Genisys"" and they're talking about THAT year in the future tense. Of course, that begs the question whether we'll still want to watch this one in 2029. Maybe not, but it is great good fun for today. ""B+""",Terminator Genisys

227,kingofdanerds,I seriously do not understand why there is so much hate for this film,7,29 June 2021,"After the failure of Terminator: Salvation (an underrated film in fact), the rights for the Terminator franchise went to Skydance Productions. In 2015, we got the fifth Terminator film, Terminator Genisys. I remember being stoked about this film and I was about 13 years old when this film came out and I was really wanting to watch it but of course nobody else in the family was into these films and so I had to miss out and as of this review, I have only seen the film once. The film was directed by Alan Taylor (Game of Thrones) and stars Jai Courtney (The Divergent series), Jason Clarke (Everest), Emilia Clarke (Game of Thrones), and Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Terminator series). The film bombed financially in the United States and it is said that due to this film's budget and marketing, this film would have had to make about $450 million to break even. The film was not well received among critics and fans.Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is sent back to the year 1984 to help protect Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) who is the mother of John Connor (Jason Clarke) who is the leader of the Resistance in the future. But, the timeline has been altered and now Sarah Connor is a hardened warrior and she has her own Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). It is up to them to help prevent Skynet from going online and wiping out the human race.The one review that truly sums up my feelings about this film and the reception it is receiving is by Mark Hughes of FORBES who said that the negative reception is a result of ""cynical nostalgia"" which ""distrusts change and anticipates failure"". He went on to state that Terminator Genisys is ""The best Terminator since T2: Judgment Day."" I will say that Terminator Genisys is criminally underrated. This film acts like a reboot/sequel. It follows that same trend that big franchise like Star Wars is doing. Making sequels that act as a reboot. That way, old fans can have something and new fans can have something as well. I know my opinion on this film is very very unpopular, so I cannot say that the older fans will like this film. I mean that is pretty evident already. The first 20 minutes or so of this film is probably the best part of the film. We start off in the future which gives us amazing visuals to look at. There are some great shots and great use of color in this film. Then, we get faithful shot for shot recreations of the opening scenes of the original 1984 Terminator. The rest of the film is fine to watch. All of this talk about alternate timelines does not get confusing. That is, if you just accept it and don't think about it for too long. I think this makes for a unique story overall. Again, as along as you just accept these concepts of alternate timelines, you should have no problem. The action in this film, while not heavy on gun play, is fine and should please the average action fan. I have seen criticism on the overuse of CGI. Here is where I stand. Yes, I prefer the practical use of stunts as seen in the first two Terminator films. But what Terminator Genisys does is try to go bigger with some of it's action scenes. Therefore, you will have to use CGI to accomplish these visions that the film makers have. The CGI is noticeable but not terrible. My only big problem with this film is really the casting. I have never gotten too much into Jai Courtney, Emilia Clarke, and Jason Clarke's acting. I just do not get invested with their characters because we have had so much better in the past. But, they do their best with what they are given. Now as for Arnold, he does fine. It is nice to see him back in the role and I do agree that this film probably would have tanked even more had Arnold not appeared in this film. Oh and do not let the PG-13 rating turn you away from this film. Especially after seeing what passed as an R rating with Terminator 3. The film is entertaining enough without the extra gore and swearing.Terminator Genisys is highly underrated but that is only my opinion. I would watch it for curiosity sake and see for yourself if it is good or not.",Terminator Genisys
228,helmutty,A solid but forgettable action-packed movie,8,30 June 2015,"The Terminator is back with a strange title, Genisys. It is clear that they are eager to continue the franchise however they do not know how. Terminator Genisys shows promise to the visionary world of James Cameron but it is hampered by non-stop big and loud action scenes, it does not stop to develop the story further. That said, it still capture the interesting premise of time travel. It is better than Terminator Salvation but that is not saying much. What you get here is series of thrilling and big CGI heavy action set piece that propel the story forward.The story: It starts off in 2029 where John Connor (Jason Clarke) and Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) set to destroy Skynet. However they are too late, it sends a T-800 back to 1984 to kill John's mother, Sarah Connor. Kyle volunteers to go back and save her. From there, the ball starts rolling. Loud action piece after another. Alan Taylor (director of Thor: The Dark World) proves that he is capable of directing huge CGI action scenes and it shows. Although they are not very imaginative, they are serviceable for action fans. He became too engrossed in showing the audience what he could do with CGI that he neglects character's development and plot progression. The pace moves quickly and does not get boring but when you take out some action scenes, the movie will fall apart. Emilia Clarke plays a decent Sarah Connor. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back with his usual stone-cold Terminator's expressions. The rest is alright but forgettable. Music by Lorne Balfe is decent enough with enough hints of the iconic theme. However the iconic Terminator theme can only be heard in the ending credit. Overall: Terminator Genisys is a big budget blockbuster choke full of action and CGI. It is a thrilling yet exhausting ride but there is nothing that particularly sticks out to me. For one watch, it is good. Even the action scenes will wear out if you watch more than one time. If the idea of a planned trilogy move forward, let's hope it will get better.More reviews on: http://moreviewsed.blogspot.sg",Terminator Genisys
229,ctowyi,Arnold Schwarzenegger is Back...,7,26 June 2015,"I want so much to give this a big Arnie's thumbs up but in all good conscience I just can't, at least not an enthusiastic one. The good news is that it didn't suck and it has all the ingredients of a popcorn tentpole movie. But it just can't be compared to the first two James Cameron classics. That's a near impossible task, but I do admire it's attempt to try.When John Connor (Jason Clarke), leader of the human resistance, sends Sgt. Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) and safeguard the future, an unexpected turn of events creates a fractured timeline. Now, Sgt. Reese finds himself in a new and unfamiliar version of the past, where he is faced with unlikely allies, including the Guardian (Arnold Schwarzenegger), dangerous new enemies, and an unexpected new mission: To reset the future...Terminator Genisys is a clever reboot in that it changes the events of T1 so that all the characters go on a new timeline trajectory. It is not a new approach (recall X-Men: Days of Future Past) and the writers took the premise of The Terminator, the cyborg buddy plot of T2: Judgement Day, mixed it up with lots of time travel tropes and let it ripped. It is clever and smart, but IMHO it's numerous self-awareness markers wear thin after a while. Still, this is a creditable piece of writing that attempts to change a constant that runs through the past four films - the John Connor genealogy.The movie feels bogged down by having to explain all the time travel mumbo jumbo (as usual, it gave my wife a headache and she couldn't keep up) in uncreative ways. It even introduces a new term, ""nexus point"", which conveniently sort of explained all the parallel timelines (I need to google that one). After a while it is indeed hard to keep up and I gave up. It made me miss the stark simplicity of Cameron's iconic first Terminator film that didn't bother to do all these explanation because making characters compelling is a cheat code.Genisys also suffers from a lack of a convincing antagonist. For that I blame the trailer which reveals the identity of that antagonist. I can see how the writers want to change it up but the antagonist is not given room to develop in a satisfying manner. In terms of protagonists it fares better. It is great to see Arnold Schwarzenegger back uttering his iconic lines and some new ones - ""I am old, but I am not obsolete"". For my taste, Emilia Clarke did a good job with her one note character but seriously in my book no one can ever beat the singularity and gravitas of Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor.The action spectacles are of the staple type and not game changers. It made me miss T2 a lot more. Those days in the cinema, as I ogled at the action sequences of T2 I felt like I was seeing them for the first time. Sadly, not here. How many times do I need to see the Golden Gate Bridge destroyed? Apparently not enough. There was one sequence involving helicopters which looked so cartoonish that I was taken out of the story. Some of the action sequences felt embedded because an alarm has sounded after some lengthy exposition. In short, it didn't feel organic. However, there are some great ones that are still worth the price of an admission.IMHO Terminator Genisys represents a nice homage to Cameron's seminal films and successfully (to a certain degree) built on the premise to hopefully justify a new trilogy. Let's see if that happens.PS - Do yourself a favour by re-watching the first two films. We did that over two nights and it really made a lot of stuff clearer in Genisys. This new one is not kind to people who have not seen the James Cameron films.",Terminator Genisys
230,totalovrdose,"A Fun, Action Packed Ride, that Leaves More Questions Unanswered than Resolved",8,1 July 2015,"When going in to see Terminator Genisys, I must admit, I had little faith the experience awaiting me would be anything less than uninteresting drivel. With the sheer amount of sequels America is producing this year, the Terminator reboot might very well be, thus far, the most entertaining, for it is certainly a fun way to spend two hours. The beginning of the feature feels nothing like previous installments, the traditional soundtrack also having been abandoned during the introduction, though when it does appear, the accentuated bass and drums certainly have an impact. The film is occasionally narrated by Kyle (Jai Courtney), who, despite portraying a competent soldier, has a tendency to complain about how the timeline has been corrupted, experiencing difficulty with accepting the current order, this repetitive notion becoming stale quickly. Our introduction to Kyle in the future, when he is rescued by John (Jason Clarke), is nothing like how it was during Salvation, which may cause the audience to question which film we ought to hold accountable.The events in T2, that were leading to the prevention of 1997 Judgement Day are discussed, though largely ignored, and it is never explained how the major event was postponed until 2017, the year in which much of the storyline is centered, while Rise of the Machines it seems, doesn't even get a mention. Genisys' decision to take parts from each feature, although peculiar in theory, is usually well established, though the addendum that only some of the traditional lore is built upon, while other aspects are left untouched, may cause some audiences to question the merit of ignored segments.Upon been sent through time at the beginning of the feature, Kyle is forced to confront a T-1000 unit (Lee Byung-Hun), who deserved a much larger role, his fierce determination and fearlessness being very well portrayed. Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor is equally adept, her strong character and dedication to Skynet's destruction being excellently articulated, while her ability to drop her British accent is especially credible. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Guardian, despite his age, proves he is no geriatric, commanding the screen with unrivaled proficiency, his character's admittance to his waning appearance, and the inclusion of his lacking abilities into the plot, making him all the more believable.J.K Simmons on the other hand as Detective O'Brien, who should perhaps have been named Molder for his conspiracy theories regarding robotics and time travel, was perhaps an unnecessary character, who seemed to be largely used for comic relief alone. His occasional humorous dialogue was rivaled by the occasional banter between Kyle, Sarah and the Guardian.Moving on, during the film, John carries himself with such cold confidence, for the most part, appearing rather stoic, Kyle humanizing him during the conversations they partake in, otherwise, John's unflinching focus on the mission may appear symbolic of the machines dedication. His speech at the beginning, when the human resistance attacks Skynet central, is very inspirational and well delivered, the fight scenes between the humans and the varying terminator units being especially eye catching, though unfortunately short lived.The effects are truly incredible to behold, and add to the intensity of the action, though the fiery explosions do sometimes appear more 'special' than 'realistic'. The chase scenes are also well choreographed, the film basically being one action scene after another surrounded by plot, and despite this being the fifth installment into the franchise, the writers have successfully crafted some interestingly original moments. This includes a scene where a terminator uniquely resuscitates another, while Matt Smith as the voice and avatar of the 2017 computer program proves to be just as memorable.Despite the continuous action, Genisys surprisingly has the time for characterization and depth, Kyle's relationship with Sarah, alongside her lacking social abilities and loneliness being discussed, while questions regarding the Guardian, and his ability to potentially feel love are also portrayed, visually as well as verbally, the emphasis on this sub-plot leading to a particularly emotional scene.By the end of the feature, a number of questions remain unanswered (a couple of which are in great need of explanation in order to satisfactorily conclude this entry), while a scene that occurs half-way through the credits, which is further indicative of a sequel, seems to prove Hollywood is a little too desperate to keep this franchise running. Although T2 is still undoubtedly the most memorable film, this reboot is sure to quench the thirst of any action sci-fi fan - as long as you don't ask too many questions by the time the credits roll.",Terminator Genisys
231,kunalkhandwala,He's back.... to save humanity and the franchise,8,13 July 2015,"In the war against machines, time has simply been a medium through which the resistance and the Terminators traveled in their attempts to prevent the inevitable future. Sometimes, it was to make Judgement day occur and other times, it was to prevent it and destroy Skynet. Director Alan Taylor (Thor: The Dark World) is all too familiar with such a concept and he literally adds another dimension to time as John Connor desperately seeks to out-play the Machines' last effort to eliminate him. What happens when John sends Kyle Reese back in time to save Sarah Connor is known to us but things get interesting when Sarah is already expecting his arrival. In terms of its plot, characters and timelines, 'Genisys' follows James Cameron's 2 films and overrides the themes established by them all. Which also suggests a more dominating presence of the franchise's main armour. Arnold Schwarzenegger....... is back. In the post apocalyptic 2027, the human resistance has almost won the war but John (Jason Clarke) realizes that it might be too late as the machines had used the time machine to send a T-1000 Terminator back in time to kill his mother, Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke). In a desperate attempt to save their own fates, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) volunteers to be the hero who will travel back and ward off any threat to Sarah. Back in 1984, he is surprised to find Sarah equipped for battle with her guardian Terminator, having anticipated his journey through time. Sequences between them and the T-1000 are exciting and the night time CGI is impressive. However, since they are aware of the future and have a basic time travel arc built by guardian, they must alter the events of the future. In 2017, a cloud based operating system, 'Genisys', is about to integrate the lives of billions of people along with Government and military infrastructure. This take over is the very inception of Skynet that enables the machines to foresee humans as a threat to their existence. At this point, the plot takes a shocking twist that overturns the events of the prior films but this very ability to alter the events is what makes the Terminator series fun to watch. A T- 3000 human cyborg aids the development of Genisys and while stopping him is one big challenge, destroying the mainframe is a whole different one. Guardian, Sarah and John must now protect themselves in the future by risking their present. Meanwhile, Gold Gate bridge sequence is remarkably thrilling followed by the overdone CGI of the helicopter chase. The countdown in Cyberdyne's complex accelarates and desperate measures are needed to prevent Genisys from going live. It's a battle between past and future, a battle between human and cyborg, between a guardian and a terminator. The khaleesi Emilia Clarke, looks more like herself rather than a mother of dragons but isn't nearly as bad-ass as Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor. Emilia pulls it off with her charm where her attempt at bad-assery fails to impress. Jai Courtney may have put in his best for Kyle's role but he simply doesn not possess the star power to hold your interest. Jason Clarke plays the war ravaged John Connor remarkably well. J.K. Simmons creates quite a stir as the inquisitive detective O'Brein who knows more about the time traveling robots than he should. But it is the social awkwardness, programmed determination straight, hard faced Arnold Schwarzenegger whose role as the guardian terminator was what made this franchise so powerful and this time around too, he saves the day for humanity. His one liners, awkward gestures and smiles, straight faced action sequences and the sincerity in playing the role that made him such a big name in Hollywood, are worth the ticket money itself. As he rightly said to Kyle, he may be old but he is not obsolete. We feel for this cyborg and want him to survive till the very end. That's what makes Arnold a great Terminator even though he might not be a great actor. Alan Taylor's continuation of the machines saga doesn't necessarily revive it. We may not want another Terminator film just because there's only so much time travel one can do and without a completely different perspective, we won't care about the characters anymore. Rather than a career send-off, Schwarzenegger's performance is more of a foot- down to say that he still has it in him. Box office glory might not be a part of its achievements but Genisys will bring back some good old school human-cyborg battle of the future with a protagonist who means it when he says that he'll be back. -7.883 on a scale of 1-10.",Terminator Genisys

233,abouhelier-r,Terminator: Genisys,7,5 July 2015,"John Connor sends Kyle Reese back in time to protect Sarah Connor, but when he arrives in 1984, nothing is as he expected it to be.The first two instalments of the Terminator series were both exquisitely engineered entertainments. Since then, the series has been on a steady decline. In fact the sequels didn't have real reasons to exist. Time travel movies are a leap of faith on the part of a filmmaker. The good ones lay out a set of rules that, as preposterous as they may seem, operate within their own air-tight logic; with puzzle pieces snapping perfectly into place. It's not the case of Terminator: Genisys. A simple summary can't even begin to cover a plot so dense that the trailer succumbed to spoilers. Trying to explain a plot that rewrites the entire series, Genisys - as the newly released Poltergeist - will serve as a good test of how keen the audience is to see basically the same old thing in a new (but very similar) bottle. This time jumping thing plays well enough if you're not thinking too deeply about it. ""Time travel makes my head hurt"" yells Kyle Reese (starring Jai Courtney) midway through the movie and so it was echoed by the audience. Director and writer made a hash of the saga's mythology, tweaking timelines and messing with its tenants for their own convenience. It's confusing. Indeed, there are several points in the script that feels like the earlier movies had criss-crossed together like the plots overlapping timelines. Is it very creative writing? Or are they ripping off the originals? Arguably it is both. Genisys tries to explain certain things that happened in the first two films, while also adding a lot of to them. For instance, in the first Terminator when Kyle Reese lands back from time travelling he smashes right on the concrete whereas Arnold Schwarzenegger has this epic intro, the movie gives you a reason for that. There are a little bit bot of connective tissue between this movie and the first two; but for the most part, the timeline is incredibly confusing and some of it make no sense whatsoever. Especially the ending which has one WTF moment that lacks credibility, even in this logic defying loopy universe. Arnold once again declares ""I'll be back."" in this fifth installment of the Terminator franchise. His return is vital, of course. J.K Simmons surprisingly brings some much needed humour to this really complicated storyline. Plus, they were clearly aiming to benefit by association with Emilia Clarke Game of Thrones cast member. She can be fearless at moment, but she can't do much about the very one-note dimension of her character and that goes as well for Jai Courtney as Reese, a role more devoid of depth or wrinkles. That leaves it to Arnold to save the day. He was 37 when the first entry was released in 1984 and is now 67, but he's still imposing and amusing up to a certain point. He can't dominate the way he did 30 years ago, even with the visual effects equivalent of plastic surgery; telling his cohorts ""I'm old, not obsolete"" but that will be up to the audience to decide. Visually, we've seen it all - those images, or many like them - so many times before. Action scenes are accumulated and seem like warmed over versions of action we've seen before in Terminator entries or elsewhere. How many times have we seen the Golden Gate Bridge destroyed in a big budget movie in past years? Did they already rebuild it since San Andreas? There's a lot of action, a lot of things get blown up, but none of it was filmed in a memorable way, not one scene was more memorable than any other scenes we've already seen. They're all ""just fine"", where they shouldn't be ""just fine"". They are part of a series of amazing action sequences. The fact is that the movie tries to be too big and it is BIG but it can't carry the weigh it loaded on itself. A scene during the end credit titles suggests that a follow up to this film is already intended by its makers. However if Arnold really wants not only to come back but to be welcomed back, he'll need one day to unterminate. I suppose there was not any reason to expect more from this movie than the lure of watered- down nostalgia, and it barely succeeds at that. Finally, like any other 3-D extravaganza released in recent summers Genisys is a wildly expensive, decent looking, mildly diverting mess that doesn't make a lick of sense. Its connection to older better movies cons us into believing it's better than it is. Overall, if you stick to the fact that it's the first Terminator but it's a new timeline and they are doing things differently now, that would have been fine; but they decided to go in another direction. It should have been better than just a turn-your- brain-off type of movie you'll have fun. There's good humour, Arnie is great, but for the most part characters are dull, the timeline is screwed and the action is disappointing.",Terminator Genisys

235,stephendaxter,Don't worry about the plot and this is a fun action film,5,6 July 2015,"Terminator Genesis, i mean Genesis, sorry Genisis, wait, thats not right, ah well who gives a crap. It is the Terminator sequel not too many people people were asking for but got anyway, so was it good? well it was alright i guess, considering i disliked the trailers and expected it to be pretty crap i'd say it was somewhat a success. Lets get the negatives out of the way shall we, i will start by saying that the plot is just absolutely terrible, everything past the 30 minute mark was just waaaaaay too dumb and convoluted and i just have one question: WHY? Not only does it cancel out everything from the previous films it gets replaced by a plot that is such a mess, and i just couldn't help but wonder why they had to do what they did. Lets forget about the plot because the more i think about it the more it makes no sense and the dumber it gets. A minor thing i had an issue with were the one liners, you don't need them in there, every single one was forced and took me out of the film. We get it, they were iconic lines but when you re-use them they lose what made them special. There was some comedy thrown in there occasionally, a few chuckles here and there, most of that from Arnold and Emilia Clarke, but none of that from Jai Courtney, he wasn't funny, like at all. J.K Simmons was in this too, why? i don't even know, some comedic relief maybe? but nothing would be different if he wasn't in it.OK, enough about the bad now for what was good, it was just a fun action film.............. if you close your ears and forget about the plot that is. There were some entertaining terminator fights and even some really entertaining ones, chase scenes were fast paced and entertaining. Also the first 30 minutes i was really liking it, they had me hooked the entire time and then they lost me for a while. It was very inconsistent in that it was entertaining when there were action pieces then it slows down to add plot twists and explanations. So in the end the fun entertaining action just slightly trumps the dumb plot. On a repeat viewing i may like it a little more if i am able to just not worry about the plot. A fun action film? Yeh, a good terminator film? No. - 5.3",Terminator Genisys
236,chappywatched,Chappy Watched: Terminator Genisys,7,8 April 2016,"I think the things I loved most about this film is that it's not just another Terminator movie.This movie deals a lot more with the notion of outcomes changing and affecting the timeline, which makes it a different movie from the previous four movies and although different, there are still a lot of scenes borrowed from the first movie – some big and some small but still recreating a lot of the scenes from the original 1984 film.It's always good to see Arnie but Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney were pretty good additions as was J.K Simmons. The relationship between Sarah and Pops (Arnie) resembled the John Connor and The Terminator in T2.This movie is a lot more special effects heavy but it does make for some awesome scenes and some awesome new Terminators. There was an awesome little scene in the movie that addresses Arnie's age, which I thought was a nice little addition.This movie isn't as good as the first two but unquestionably a lot better than the last two.The big bummer for me was the big reveal that was ruined in the trailer and on the poster.From the second you see John Connor, you know he is bad and after watching the movie; it would have made for such an awesome surprise!So thanks for that Paramount!Terminator Genisys is a fun, humorous and awesome action flick that is no doubt paving the way for more movies.Would love to see it again in the cinemas but if I don't get the chance, it will definitely be a day one addition to my collection.",Terminator Genisys
237,Tehmeh,Watched it for Arnold alone. Positively surprised.,6,4 July 2015,"No lies here: the movie is as flawed as it is unnecessary. It's nowhere near the first two Terminator movies. It's the 4th sequel, and we know what the odds are here. But Terminator Genisys makes the only right choice: instead of Terminator Salvation, this one aims for fun and entertainment. It's the only thing it can manage, and it does just that.It's not as mindless as you'd think, since there are a few twists and actually some real effort to the story, but it's two things that keeps this movie going: Fast pace and Arnold.The pacing is relentless but forgiving at the same time. It doesn't tire you nor overdo the action pieces. The story moves from point A to B and eventually to C very quickly. Usually this might be a bad approach, but here it's the only logical solution. We don't have time to think about all the various faults and holes in the script, and then again Jai Courtney or Emilia Clarke don't have enough time to bore me to tears before Arnold shows up again.Arnold...what can I say? Before seeing this movie, I feared I would feel sad for the guy. I feared he would be used like a cheap toy. At times he was used like a cheap toy, but Arnold was way too good to let anything or anyone to ruin this for him. He wasn't just the occasional cameo sidekick I feared he would be, he was one of the leads and had plenty of screen time. And the child inside me cheered again, as Arnold was by far the best single thing this movie had to offer.There is the biggest problem, too: If you don't like Arnold, you're probably not going to like this movie. Courtney and Clarke are...just some people. I felt absolutely nothing while watching them. I'd even say that even if Courtney is boring, Clarke is straight up bad. Anyway, they are just famous people spouting lines, and I couldn't care for them. Of course Arnold spouted (often very bad) lines and especially one-liners too, but he was still easily light years ahead of all the other characters.While the plot has a lot of things going for it, it can't carry the movie and further examination will tear it apart. It does its job though, and gives enough reasons for things to happen.I'm not making excuses for this movie. It's flawed, it's not R-rated as Terminator movie should be, this many sequels should not exist, it has no business being compared to T1 or T2, but it did give me one more movie where Arnold really does his absolute best with the material he's given and steals the show. It's also more fun than the dull Terminator Salvation we got a few years back.To summarize: If you like Arnold, you will probably like it. If you want it to compare to the first two Terminator movies as a cinematic construct, you'll be disappointed. Not a great movie by all means, but nowhere near a disaster. Decent entertainment, but with Arnold. And that's a plus.",Terminator Genisys
238,schroeder-gustavo,Convoluted Mess,3,7 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys is the latest disappointment in the Terminator franchise, which I've gotten used to by now, unfortunately. The movie is convoluted, messy and a lot of things make absolutely no sense looking back.Let's start off by mentioning the few good things in the film. I actually loved the first few minutes of the movie, because it tries to tie up the first Terminator with this movie and it has some pretty impressive thematic depth. I also loved Arnold in the movie, he's always good because he is so charismatic. And now the bad. Before anything I have to mention that Emilia Clarke and Arnold really do their best with the script they were given and you can really tell that they actually put effort into their acting, but the terrible, cliché-filled script with inside ""jokes"" from the first Terminator movies is just annoying and very bad written. Also, the effects in this movie are no better than the effects in T2, a movie that came out nearly 25 years ago. The CGI in the movie, which is abundant to say the least even feels like a video game at times. While James Cameron's Terminator movies were dark and gritty, this just feels like a bland modern day blockbuster movie. And that's the best word I can use to describe pretty much every action scene in Terminator Genisys: bland. They try to create so many different things in the movie with the different timelines that it creates some plot holes in the Terminator franchise. The actor that played the T- 1000 was terrible and he felt like a lifeless actually dumb robot, unlike the iconic T-1000 in T2. Jay Courtney in the movie is OK, but it never really feels like he's Kyle Reese and you can really tell he's acting most of the time: the thing is, the guy does his job, but he stays merely serviceable and not at all a role that anyone will remember the guy for. The biggest problem I have with this film is really that there are no memorable action sequences, as no action scene really stands out, which is a terrible thing since this is an action filled extravaganza, but again, a bland one.Terminator Genisys is a dull action movie that feels way too long, despite being less than two hours long, it has no memorable moments and I will not remember any scene in this movie in two days.",Terminator Genisys
239,caseynicholson,Great Movie IF You're a Fan of the Franchise,8,1 September 2015,"I was pretty skeptical going into this movie, as I knew that it didn't get much critical acclaim. I'm happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised and found this to be a fantastic film--with one or two qualifcations.First things first, there's a good chance that your appreciation for this movie will correlate to how big of a fan you are of the franchise. If the Terminator movies are favorites of yours, you've seen them many times, etc, then there's a good chance that you may find this to be a pretty neat film. If you're not a fan or haven't seen the films in some time and don't really remember a good bit of the mythology that follows in the four preceding films, then you may find yourself a bit lost in this movie. It's definitely a sequel to beat all sequels, meaning that it is fairly impossible for it to stand alone on its own merit. But if you're a big fan and get the larger storyline, then this may be a real treat.I myself made it a point to watch all four movies leading up to it--and I'm certainly glad that I did! This movie weaves elements of each of the other four movies into its plot in a way that is clever. Throughout the film you are time and time again presented with a smorgasbord of treats from the other movies--and it even builds on ""Terminator: Salvation"", which I found to be less connected to the other three films until I saw its elements woven into ""Genisys"".There are a few cons. First, as I alluded to earlier, what works for this movie is also what works against it. The fact that it incorporates all the other films in the franchise is neat, but it also makes the film have a bit of an annoying feel to it--it becomes obvious that this is purely a fan fiction flick written specifically for the ""Terminator"" faithful. And as much as I like the series, there was just something odd about how in your face that element was that I found to be a bit of a turn off.Second, it was a bit strange how the casting for this movie was done. The kid from ""Salvation"" was a much better match for Kyle Reese from the 1984 film than the lead actor in this movie, and it's extremely odd that Christian Bale wasn't re-cast as John Conner. One would think that those actors could have been signed to add a better sense of continuity to this movie.Third, like all the Terminator movies (the first one being the lone exception), this is a movie that is strongly driven by its action sequences. That didn't bother me very much with this film, but some would find it problematic, I'm sure.Nevertheless, since I like the franchise, I found this to be a great treat....indeed, right up there with the scores I gave to T2 and T3, so I'm going with 8/10 stars.",Terminator Genisys
240,zacpetch,A Long and Pointless Rant about Movie Critics and their Deliberate Calculated Sabotage of Terminator Genisys,7,21 January 2016,"This was a good film. Yes it was flawed, it was messy and the plot makes very little sense. It completely wasted the considerable talents of Matt(hew) Smith and Emilia Clarke and instead forced Jai Courtney on us. But it was enjoyable popcorn fodder, which is all it needed to be. It was loads of fun and I had a great time watching it.Yet as I write this the news has broken that Paramount Pictures have removed the series's sixth instalment from their release schedule, implying that the series has been killed. This film has officially become a Franchise Killer on par with Batman & Robin or Godfather 3.And who's to blame? Film critics. They seemed to have all conspired together to kill this movie before it was even released. They went in looking for problems and set out to sabotage the movie from the word go. The film has plot hooks for the next two instalments but critics decided to call them out as plot holes instead. They attacked it for the complete lack of charisma of Jai Courtney instead of praising the fact that everyone else makes up for him. They went around hating on Arnold Schwarzeneggar for his one-liners even though these brought the house down in the cinema.But the American public foolishly listened to them, even though the critics had got it wrong, and the box office flop was enough that no more films are going to happen. And that's a damn shame.The critics set out to bring this film franchise down and now they've succeeded. Two perfectly fine pieces of popcorn fun have been needlessly scrapped and shut down a struggling franchise just as it got good again. I hope you're all happy.",Terminator Genisys

242,freshclean-66-318608,This Could Have Been Better.,6,31 December 2015,"The ""Terminator"" franchise should have stopped when it was still at it's best with ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". I'm not saying ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"", ""Terminator Salvation"", and this ""Terminator"" film was bad it's just that they didn't gel together and complete a circle like the first two. The idea of this ""Terminator"" film was good it's just that it could have been done better. With the exception of Emilia Clarke, who played Sarah Connor, the actors in this film didn't really resemble the characters in the first two films. Decently filled with action, I think this film could have been a little better if the terminator T-1000 (Byung-hun Lee) had a larger part in this film. At this point with the ""Terminator"" franchise the more terminators in one film with similar agendas the better. Again, this ""Terminator"" film could have been so much better so don't look for it to be as good as the first two ""Terminator"" films.",Terminator Genisys
243,elenaphysics,I really enjoyed it!!!,9,9 October 2018,"I have always been a fan of Terminator movies. Well no exactly , just the first and the second. The 3rd one I can't even remember what happened. The 4th one(Salvation) had no fun at all. It was very different from all the other movies. Terminator is a very interesting concept but also I has to be entertaining as well.
This movie was a surprise for me. After watching Terminator Salvation I did not want to watch Genisys. And accidentally now, 3 years after its release I decided to give it a try. Oh boy it was perfect! So much action, so much fun. The plot was totally unpredictable!
Of course there are some serious gaps in the movie. When dealing with time travel and alternative realities, you can't get all the answers. 
Also the Genisys facilities were unguarded??
What happened to T1100 from the beginning of the movie?
So many ananswered questions but who cares? It was so entertaining.
I did not mind the selection of the Daenerys for Sarah Connor. Of course Linda Hamilton was perfect as sarah connor. She was iconic. But we cant have everything right?",Terminator Genisys
244,skoyles,Totally exciting and satisfying,9,11 November 2015,"I yield to no one in my affection for the Terminator movies. From the very first little movie to the latest I have enjoyed each in different ways for different reasons. None is a failure. From what I had heard and read this newest (and I hope not the last!) instalment was inferior, not respectful of its predecessors, poorly thought out and, as one reviewer wrote, makes a hash of all that went before. Fortunately for me I had seen the old double VCR version of T2 with an alternate ending, i.e., the destruction of San Francisco. Imagine my joy to see it in this movie. Terminator Genisys is reverential - there are so many scenes from the first movie it is almost plagiarism. The tricky business of time is dealt with most satisfactorily. The most shocking reversal of earlier matters was jarring but OK. Emilia Clarke was superb as this Sarah Conner. How fortunate we have been with all three actors Linda Hamilton, Lena Heady (on television) and Clarke! The male leads were very good, particularly the John Conner character with J.K Simmons giving another wonderful performance. I found the whole movie very satisfying and I hope that we will yet again hear the words, ""I'll be bahck.""",Terminator Genisys
245,lois-lane33,Why change 'Dum' to 'Dumb'...?,6,18 July 2015,Which is what this IMDb system is doing-forcing me to not use the title I was going to use for this review. I find that annoying. Kind of like the theme of the movie-the machines taking control type of thing.....I can remember thinking that the first Terminator film probably wasn't a great film and not seeing it when it first came out in the cinemas all those years ago. The following year I saw it on VHS and I liked it-in fact I liked it a lot. So as each subsequent film came out I went to see them and I enjoyed them. So far they've made four of them and this one makes five. I doubt they'll make a sixth installment as this one was so complex it wasn't even followable from time to time. That didn't bother me much because I wasn't expecting anything that would be easy to follow based on the fact they had already scoured the possibilities of their recurring time travel theme as that applies to basically traveling back to the same time period over and over again. Which you would think is a flat out impossibility. Since you probably can't exist as different people in the same time space. Maybe forward time travel might be possible by default by way of suspended animation in deep space canceling out years of time giving the impression of a forward time jump but I don't believe backwards time travel can exist at all-I think the Universe is funny about stuff like that.You would be polluting your own future self's ability to evolve without undue influence. I think that would cancel out your own ability to act independently causing you to change your pathway and not do what you had already done which would probably cause a rip in the space time continuum and a rip inside your head also. Most definitely not what you want to experience. Good film if you don't mind yet another set of actors/actresses (Arnie's character being the sole exception) representing characters that have already been portrayed by people other than those who played the main characters in the first couple of movies. I thought this was a weird one-when you get right down to it & not necessarily worthy of high praise-maybe even not necessarily worthy of any praise at all. I gave it a Junior High pass at six out of ten.Its mire of time travel ambiguities will alienate most adults.,Terminator Genisys
246,EasternZZ,Probably the 3rd best Terminator movie,8,19 October 2018,"Terminator 2, Terminator 1, Terminator Genisys, Terminator 3, & Terminator Salvation (Best to worst)This movie is well done, the action is awesome, and it is always great to see Arnold on the big screen. I remember the time when every male would flock to see an Arnold movie on opening night. He is getting old, but he still has great presence on screen and there is just something magical about Arnold. He was destined to be a star.The story is a ""what if"" scenario. It doesn't try to continue the original Terminator story, it takes a left turn and just creates a story many have thought about; ""What would happen if the Sarah Connor from Terminator 2 was in Terminator 1?"" Well, this is what happens. She doesn't mess around, she doesn't run and scream and cry, she doesn't have time to fall in love, she is out to kick butt and have been trained by her own personal Terminator to prepare for what is to come.Once again, the action is well done, and this movie ends in a cool battle between the Terminator and Terminator John Connor. It is great, and take this movie for what it is. It is just a ""what if"" story. Nothing serious, you can always go back and watch the original 2 movies, but this is just a fun little movie you can watch multiple times and have a good time.8/10",Terminator Genisys

249,Genti23,Excellent film making,7,20 December 2015,"Terminator Genisys is a return to form for the Terminator franchise since T3 wasn't on the same level as the first two and Salvation,while in my opinion very good,still no where near the first two movies.Now I'm not saying that Genisys is as good as the first two either,because hardly any movie ever is as good as that,but this movie is still very good. The best part of the movie and what takes it to a whole new awesome level is Arnold Shwarzenegger,who returns to the leading role as a real bad ass.Also Jason Clarke is outstanding and Emilia Clarke does a wonderful job at portraying the famous Sarah Connor.Despite the hate,I think that Jai Courtney was fine as Kyle Reese too. The visuals were truly awesome too,and they stand out on the breath taking action scenes,which are truly something incredible and well done.Add there the great score by Lorne Balfe and Brad Fiedel,and you get this amazing movie filled with awesome sequences that stand out and are very memorable. Now while the story is not great and it does have some plot holes especially connecting to the old movies,they take away little here as everything else is very well done. I liked the way that John Connors character is done,as he has the right motivation and the perfect actor to portray that to us,in a way that we buy and enjoy it. I loved the end battle and that whole scene,I liked the villains motivations and the way it was written,and the way the movie concluded it was very satisfying. I truly think that this is the perfect start to what is hopefully the start of a new trilogy that is to come very soon with sequels that are as good as this.",Terminator Genisys
250,paul_3-960-896774,Better when marketing is avoided,7,23 January 2016,"There's a few things I feel like I have to say before this review. I always try to be objective when I watch a movie, form my own opinion, before subjecting myself to others' opinion. But with this movie, way back when it was under in its casting stage, I wanted Tatiana Maslany to play Sarah Connor. And then I heard these mixed to negative reviews on the film so I pushed it off because I didn't want to waste my time on it.I saw today turns out it's not half as bad as I thought it would be. I liked the story, the action looked good, and there were enough questions left unanswered for me to be interested in a sequel. My only problem with the film was that the marketing ruined the film, it revealed way too much, and I probably wouldn't have liked the movie if I had seen it while the Marketing was on. Because it's only when I saw the movie, I remembered seeing some key scenes in the trailers and TV Spots.By @garcwrites",Terminator Genisys
251,justinwfirestone,Not that bad,6,11 July 2015,"Really now, Terminator Genisys is not all that bad of a movie, definitely better than the third and fourth Terminator movies. The general malaise from other critics focuses on how the movie isn't great, the acting is generally subpar, and the, as Britney Spears might call it, time-travel-speed Byzantine plot. If I were to give out ratings, I would throw out at least 2.2 out of 4.0 stars, and I would say it's worth torrenting some night at home with some KFC chizza.Most importantly, we learn that Emilia Clarke (pretty, for a girl) looks better in her natural hair color, Arnold Schwarzenegger can still deliver deadpan one liners and command uncomfortable laughter, and Jai Courtney is like a younger, poorer man's Vin Diesel. We also learn that it's possible to time-travel-speed in two directions, that robots can feel robot love, that humans can feel robot love, and that you sometimes have choices to make, while at other times your life is just a straight line from which you cannot deviate.The evil villain, science, rears its ugly head in the form of the world's first ""killer app,"" which over 1 billion people have preordered on their various electronic devices. The app is called Genisys (probably after Peter Gabriel left), and it promises to finally, once and for all, do what the NSA has already done, which is to harvest every single bit of information onto a server that can later be used to send you coupons for Kohl's.Er, no, actually, Genisys has only one goal: after it finally uploads itself to the world like Lawnmower Man, it will fire off all of the world's nuclear weapons, which somehow, inexplicably, are connected to Friendster via Ethernet cables. Even more inexplicably, all of the world's nuclear missiles will only be able to kill 3 billion of the 7 billion people on the planet. I'm going to guess that the 4 billion survivors were all safely hidden away in their panic rooms or on their way back from truffle hunting on Mars.How can the population of the Earth be so stupid as to willingly pay for such a horrible app that surely will not offer any in-game purchases? And what exactly is a Kardashian? Don't worry, because there are at least two people who know what's up and they are going to stop it all by blowing the servers up real good. Thank the heavens that Skynet was never smart enough to store Genisys in THE CLOUD, or at least have some backup tapes stored in a fire safe under the porch.Thankfully, our heroes are straight (hetero), because they have to bone in order to make the real hero, John Connor. But Arnold might have to be there to watch. Awkward! Even if they were both gay, they likely could do some kind of mutual masturbation session and swap fluids.As with most of the other summer blockbusters, there is no real fear that any of the main characters will die, because if they die, then the world would end and presumably the movie as well. And the new terminator model seems so indestructible that even though no conventional weapons can hurt it, the heroes keep firing conventional weapons at it for fun until Arnold figures on using magnets. Magnets! How do they work?!",Terminator Genisys

Same time when it satisfy old fans it address all new audience and generation. It offers to new audience perfect way to introduce Terminator universe. 3D in this movie doesn't offer any added value. I don't like these subsequently 3D converted movies. Dark scenes are almost too dark to watch with 3D glasses and action scenes get confused pixel mess. Most likely it is best way to watch ordinary 2D movie. Terminator Genisys is full of harmless action which tries to offer something to all audience. That maybe is it's biggest weakness.

Being a fan of Terminator requires a lot of effort already for the paradoxes created, but it is all there that hides the beauty of the saga. The cast, including Arnold, does not shine, (especially Emilia Clarke as the infamous Sarah Connor) and the film itself, although it has an interesting and ""alternative timeline"" to tell, fails miserably, with no-needed jokes too, ending in a parody of itself.",Terminator Genisys
255,chi_town_fed,High Tech Load of Crap,3,8 February 2018,"This is by far the WORST film of the franchise. The casting is beyond horrible. They cast the worst John Connor, Kyle Reese, and Sarah Connor I have ever seen. The men were overwhelmingly in touch with their feminine side and do not come across as hardened soldiers that have been fighting a war for survival for most of their life. The joke of a Sarah Connor came across more like the girl next door versus a battle ready heat packing mama-jama she was attempting to portray. This is in complete contrast to how the original Sarah Connor played her role in Terminator 2. She was simply AWESOME!!!This is an extremely poor, all-over-the-place story line. Terminator 2 was the last great version of this series. This version was like watching a pinball bouncing randomly from beginning to end. The potential for a Terminator movie is huge. The flop of this version was as massive as the potential. Writers and directors of this movie simply suck. All they did was focus on special effects and explosions. Everything else was just thrown in as an after thought. The casting, story, and acting was unbelievably sub standard for such a major film. I think Hollywood thinks the next movie always has to have something the previous movies did not. Question: Anyone ever watch the show Law and Order? I have and can't get enough of it. Why? Because the characters have become real to me (in a fictitious tv way). I care what happens to them and watch not knowing what is going to impact their lives next.You don't have to keep trying to one-up the previous movie. You just have to make us care about the characters. Once you do that, anything that happens to them, big or small, matters to me. If I don't care about aka connect with the characters, you can drop a nuclear bomb on their heads and I wouldn't bat an eye.

I had never expected it to be smart or engaging, but definitely not that stupid. From the moment that John Connor reappears and starts to explain the situation, the movie becomes unbearable. Even sci-fi movies should have their own laws and limitations.Action is OK at times, but it doesn't have any special touch, as if nobody really cared about it. Best scenes involve T-1000, but they're too few and they were done before (although there is an improvement in special effect for the last 20 years).Acting is the worst. Arnold is what you expect him to be, but the others are miscast. Emilia Clarke looks very sweet and I think that explains it all. But Jai Courtney is the worst. It's not that he does not fit to play the role, he doesn't fit any major role in any movie. He's just a bad actor. Maybe he can play a third grade terminator.

Fill the film with idiotic CGI gunfights and chases. Unlike T2 where the chase sequences had a serious nod to some of John Wayne's action shots this didn't have any continuity or 'real feel'.Both Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney are so wooden that you can almost see the strings being pulled. Unlike Linda Hamilton who was superb - Arny was great and quite funny as he tries to smile.When one considers the army of technicians employed here it is a shame that the money wasn't spent on competent script writers and decent actors.",Terminator Genisys

Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) is one of my favourite films of all time, I just can't stress enough, how much I love it. To be honest, I like every film from the series. Of course, they are far far away from being close to T1 not to mention T2, in terms of being good, but hey they still got terminators in them~! Unfortunately, I have watched the trailer, and in my modest opinion it was horrible The film is probably lame too, but there is no way I am not going to watch it. I just hope for a decent film, please, don't let me down5 minutes – nostalgia trip~! I love it so much already 11 minutes – special effects are crawling with CGI which I hate so much but I expected it, of course The actors choice is also something I can't really agree with at least we will get good old Arnold Schwarzenegger. And there's the music it is over-glorified, fake and totally unnecessary it actually kills the mood instead of building it up 16 minutes – it's super awesome watching the story from Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) but from the different perspective, please keep being good and even better~! 24 minutes – this film is a big nostalgia journey, I love how they have recreated some important scenes from T231 minutes - ... ... ... ... and it all goes to sh.. They are actually making a comedy out of it now... and it was going so well... I can't believe it~!43 minutes – past, present, future, present, future, past I am bloody lost 1h 10minutes – they made Matrix out of Terminator or whatever it is It's not bad, it just feels weird, wrong and should have never happened. It feels like a little child took over the series and has created his own version of a fable 1h 31minutes – it's fun and all but this is what people on youtube could do, minus high-paid actors of course. Honestly, I do enjoy it, but it is like a bad joke from people who have no idea, whatsoeverOh boy, where to start No real Terminator fan will skip this, unless they have not watched anything except for T and T2, in that case; keep away from this garbage too. Unfortunately, it is another sequel which should have never come out, a true disgrace to The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Go ahead, watch it, it's not that bad for a random film just another flick, you will watch once, and never get back to it again (There is also a short scene after the ending credits – people doing this, should be slapped for it)tgchan's rating: 5.5 /10",Terminator Genisys
260,cnycitylady,Terminator revives our love for franchise,8,29 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys is the latest installment in the franchise that began over thirty years ago and it hearkens back to those earlier days when the franchise followed a simple time loop. The characters are all well established and known, being Sarah Connor, Kyle Reese, John Connor and, of course, the Terminator himself. This alternate time-line sends Kyle back to protect Sarah but finds that she is more than capable of taking care of herself, and the two set off to save the world from nuclear destruction.The movie plays with the audiences sense of nostalgia and love for the original movies, and although this pleases the fans it doesn't really give the movie a standing or staying power of its own. All of the movies' biggest scenes can be traced to similar scenes in prior Terminator movies. They even re-due and revamp some scenes word for word, which again, helps to satisfy our nostalgic longing but does little to push forth this new plot line. Its lack of self worth can at times be frustrating, but doesn't really take away from the good time it provides. The characters interact in fun ways and the action is everything you expect it to be. Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney have a fantastic chemistry and play off of each other in a refreshing way, making the love between Sarah and Kyle sweeter, harsher and more heartrendingly true than ever portrayed before.Most importantly this movie feels like a Terminator film, so we can forgive it its small shortcomings and enjoy the ride. 7.8/10",Terminator Genisys

262,murtaza_mma,"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A ""Terminator"" movie for the fans, by the fans",7,3 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys, directed by Alan Taylor, is the fifth installment in the Terminator series. The movie marks Arnold Schwarzenegger's much awaited return to the movie franchise that over the years has become synonymous with him. Terminator Genisys serves as a retroactive continuity to the previous films in the series. In other words, the characters are more or less the same, only they exist in an alternate reality. While Schwarzenegger reprises his iconic role, that of a Terminator T-800 (Model 101), the parts of Sarah Connor, John Connor and Kyle Resse are played by Emilia Clarke, Jason Clarke and Jai Courtney, respectively. Terminator Genisys begins in the year 2029 with John Connor, the messianic leader of mankind's war against Skynet, preparing for one last decisive attack at the enemy's main defense grid in Los Angeles with the aim of destroying its hidden weapon stored in a remote facility. But, before John and men can reach the weapon, Skynet plays a masterstroke forcing John to send Kyle Reese, his most trusted friend, back in time to protect Sarah Connor. When Kyle arrives in 1984 Los Angeles, much to his dismay, he soon learns that nothing is as he expected it to be. With his back against the wall, he must quickly come to terms with the reality and do whatever it takes to fulfill his mission.Alan Taylor, who has made a name for himself making television shows like Games of Thrones, certainly seems like an odd choice to direct a film like Terminator Genisys. After all, the movie belongs to a franchise that was once helmed by a filmmaker of James Cameron's pedigree. Well, Taylor, to his credit, appears to have done his best to remain faithful to the old themes and character arcs. In fact, it wouldn't be far-fetched to assume that Taylor and his writers, Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier, are Terminator film fans themselves. For, all they seem interested in achieving with Terminator Genisys is to create a sense of nostalgia for the enthusiasts of the film franchise by trying to repackage the best elements from The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). The strongest point of Terminator Genisys is its state of the art computer-generated imagery and visual effects, which get further enhanced when experienced in 3D. The quality of acting ranges from average to good. While Emilia Clarke looks convincing as Sarah Connor, she fails to match the raw intensity that Linda Hamilton exuberated while playing the part in the first two films of the series—be it the action or romance. Jason Clarke is delightful to watch as John Connor but Jai Courtney appears to be trying a bit too hard, especially in some of the lighter scenes he shares with Schwarzenegger. As for Schwarzenegger, while his attempts at humor come across as rather forced, he looks absolutely brilliant in the action sequences.Overall, Terminator Genisys has nothing new to offer but it does succeed in making us experience several bouts of nostalgia. For the action movie enthusiasts, Terminator Genisys is nothing short of a delectable feast. The movie reminds us why we love the T-800 in the first place. It makes us realize why all kinds of humanoid robots that we see in various movies pale in comparison to the T-800. A character in Terminator Genisys does well to remind us that the T- 800 may be old but it's certainly not obsolete. As the saying goes, 'Old is Gold'. Perhaps, the best way to approach Terminator Genisys is to see it as a fan's tribute to The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. It's a movie by the fans and for the fans. So, watch it for the love of T- 800 and the man who has immortalized it: ‪‎Arnold Schwarzenegger‬!For more on cinema, please visit my film blog ""A Potpourri of Vestiges"".",Terminator Genisys
263,roddekker,Ho-Hum!... And One More Time Through That Infernal Time Machine,1,27 September 2016,"And, speaking about Arnold Schwarzenegger (who's now 70 years old) (and don't he look it?) - Like, hasn't this tired, rickety, old relic (whose net worth is estimated at being $400 million) had enough of the celebrity limelight, yet!!?? Hasn't he!!?? And when it came to his role here in Terminator Genisys as The Guardian (aka. ""Pops"") - Man, I can't begin to tell you what a total embarrassment he was in his part. He sure looked like a doddering, old fool to me (kicking ass one more time) (Spare me!), and uttering some of the most stupid and inane lines imaginable.And when he did his hideous ""shit-grin"" smile (for about the 4th time) - I can't begin to tell you how much this old buffoon made my skin crawl, big-time! Yep. After having to tolerate the utter nonsense in this Sci-Fi, time-travel dud - To me, Schwarzenegger is utterly despicable.",Terminator Genisys
264,rcolgan,A Weak Addition To the Terminator Franchise,4,13 July 2015,"Now in its fifth instalment the Terminator series, Arnold has returned once again in another attempt to stop the seemingly unavoidable judgement day from happening. But sadly at this point it feels as if the franchise has been back too many times. It fails to bring anything substantially new and instead feels more like a weak rehash of things we've already seen in previous films.We open the film with familiar ground. In a post apocalyptic war the humans, led by John Connor (Jason Clarke), launch an assault taking out Skynet once and for all. But after their victory they discover that a T-800 (played by a CG Arnold Schwarzenegger and a body double) has been sent back in time to 1984 in order to kill Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) and they send Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to protect her. But when he arrives everything is different. Sarah is not the meek helpless person we saw in the first Terminator, but rather a hardened warrior. And the Terminator Kyle is sent to kill has already been taken care of. with the only T-800 left being an aged model who has raised and protected Sarah since her childhood that she calls ""Pops"" (played by the real Schwarzenegger).After this we diverge in to needlessly convoluted storyline of time travel silliness involving our leads travelling from 1984 to 2017, dealing with alternating time-lines that correct Kyle's memories and a new Skynet using a new ""killer app"" to take over the world. At times it's hard to follow and all the complicated time travel is basically the film's way of being able to reset the world and the characters to start a new slate in a more modern setting. The strongest part of the film probably ends up being Schwarzenegger. Whilst his aged Terminator is obviously just a clever way to get him into the film, the concept of his flesh ageing as any human make sense and his ""old but not obsolete"" theme is different to what we've seen in previous films and does lead to some interesting scenes of his joints stiffening up mid battle. Plus as usual he does deliver the most laughs in the film through his robot trying to be human routine whilst still able to pull of the imposing figure that made the Terminator great to begin with. But unfortunately this old Arnie seems to be the only element of the film that isn't a rehash from earlier films. The story is the same mixture we saw in T-2 with Arnie protecting the humans, a theme of whether a robot can love and the heroes attempting to stop judgement day. The only difference being that here the characters are so poorly developed that we don't really root for them the same way we did in previous instalments. Our characters are given such little time to develop that when they go from 1984 to 2017 they never have a single line of dialogue reacting to how different things are in the future.Then there's the way the film seems to destroy the intimidating presence that Skynet had in the other films. They're defeated so quickly in the short opening with the humans toppling them like domino's, that I was left wondering how they were even a threat to begin with. But worse yet is how the film seems to ruin the intimidating image of the original T-800 from the first Terminator movie changing him from a near unstoppable presence from the first film, into an easily defeated nuisance who's defeated almost as quickly as he is introduced.When it comes to the fight scenes they're a bit of a mixed bag. At times Alan Taylor proves himself confident of creating a decent action sequence with some of the earlier fight scenes with Byung-Hun Lee set in the 1980's are good creating a cool game of cat and mouse with a T-1000 chasing a helpless Kyle through a clothing store. But other fights just appear as mindless CGI violence looking as generic as you can get. The worst being a helicopter chase which uses some of the worst CGI that I've seen in a blockbuster movie in quite a while with helicopters having a cartoon's concept of physics and look atrociously unbelievable throughout.Ultimately the film relies only on nostalgia. It tries to remind you of the past Terminator any time it can with half the dialogue in the film being recycled from the other movies (""I'll be back"" ""Come with me if you want to live"" etc.) and relying on tie ins to previous Terminators showing the original T-800 along with the iconic designs of the futuristic metal exoskeletons. But in trying to do this it feels more like a homage to the Terminator films than it does a new instalment. And not a good homage either.",Terminator Genisys

267,vistheindian,I will not be back,5,15 July 2015,"Quickie Review:Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is sent back to 1984 by the leader of the human resistance John Connor (Jason Clarke), to protect his mother Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke). When Kyle arrives, everything is not as it used to be. Sarah and Kyle, in their quest to safeguard the future make unexpected allies and face dangerous enemies. Terminator Genisys aims to reset the timeline of the all the stories that have come before to try and bring a fresh new take on the franchise. While that is a good idea in principle, the execution of the plan is not a complete success. Arnold Schwarzenegger is still a great Terminator, and he is the highlight of the movie. There also some clever tie-ins with the previous movies. However, the action scenes were nothing special, the villain's motive seems lacking, and the chemistry between Sarah and Kyle was just plain annoying. Terminator Genisys is yet another let down in the franchise.Full Review:I love the first two Terminator movies, even decades later they are still amongst the best sci-fi action movies ever made. So you would think I would hate the idea of those stories being reset by Terminator Genisys. Quite the contrary, I like the idea of an alternate timeline because then the writers aren't shackled to what has come before and tell fresh new stories. Though they did take advantage of that freedom, the end result was not completely satisfying.Arnold Schwarznegger, our favourite Terminator is back! I was a little concerned that they will keep making jokes on how old he is. They do point it out, but he is still kicking major butts in all the action scenes and still is that likable socially clueless robot. I also thought the relationship that Sarah Connor and the Terminator had was really interesting. It was a great evolution of Sarah's feelings towards him from fear in Terminator, to hesitant alliance in Terminator 2, to now a complete embrace of him as almost a surrogate father. It was as if they were paying homage to John's and Terminator's relation in Terminator 2, where Sarah contemplated that he may be the best father figure John could ever have. There are lot of these homages in the movie that I really appreciated. I'll leave them for you to find, but I recommend re-watching the first two films for the easter egg hunting.Reading those positives, you might be wondering what was so wrong that I rated the movie so low? Well, I'll explain. First of all, the action in this movie is very generic. It's not that it was poorly shot, it was simply not memorable. Once again we have Golden Gate Bridge chase, Terminator being thrown through walls and windows, terminators taking on absurd amount of bullets as they moved slowly across the hall. Nothing about it excited me. Second, the constant bickering between Sarah and Kyle was almost unbearable to watch. I get that they aren't exactly on the same page in the beginning of the movie, so there will be some clashing, but this kept on going for far too long. Third, I'm not going to say who the villain is in case you managed to skip the trailers, but his motive was completely non-existent. He was just doing villainous things because he is the bad guy, that's it.In the end, I can't really recommend this movie to watch in the cinema. Yes, it's bit better than Terminator 3 and Terminator Salvation, but that doesn't mean it's a worthy sequel. Suffice to say I will not be back to see it again.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Terminator Genisys
268,Eric_Cubed,Hideous aberration of the original,1,14 July 2015,"So I knew I was going into this one with very low expectations, in order to stave off hating the film for completely betraying the original. But this was not enough, not nearly enough, to make me despise this one. First off, they blatantly rip off the dialogue and scenes from Terminator 1, without passion, without class, without tribute and without any respect whatsoever. The writers/producers of this one were nothing but stupid, completely lacking creative intelligence, like a couple of adolescents with too much money. Let us now all thank the movie gods they are not in charge of the new star wars. Not only do they screw us and James Cameron with nonsensical time-lines, abstruse theory and incongruent scenes, themes and story lines, they have the arrogance, the effrontery and entitlement to try to make us believe their version is somehow superior to the original films. I would have liked this one better if Jerry Bruckheimer had done it, as a rehashed version of Armageddon. At least that would have had some semblance of sentimental vestige as we know as ""charm"" in the movie experience. This is the ""boy-band"" of movie reboot's: overproduced, spinally taped, vapid and empty beyond comparison. Avoid at all costs, if only for the principle.",Terminator Genisys

On the one hand, the basic backbone of the plot is actually quite interesting, with its alternative timelines and multiple terminators and such, but sadly it was not directed or produced in a way that really does its ideas justice. The two leads were not particularly convincing I didn't think, and were light years behind Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn back in the original film. The film started confusing itself and the flow felt disjointed, with a lot of plot holes and loose ends that never went anywhere. All in all if you leave your brain at the door its entertaining enough I suppose, but it is nowhere near the league the first two films are in. Although it is better than T3.

271,trevorwomble,A pointless partial remake of the first film,6,5 June 2019,"This film isn't as bad as I expected but it could have been a lot better. Whilst the visuals are great and reminiscent of T2, the film falls down on an awful mess of a script.Whilst it isn't as painful to watch as Terminator Salvation, it does feel like a cash grab and I think audiences knew that which is why it underperformed. There's some fun to be had in watching Arnie in his most famous role and some of the set pieces are well done (the bus scene in particular) it adds nothing to the Terminator franchise. Watch it on TV if you like but don't bother to buy it. Just rewatch the first two and marvel at how well made and original they were.

Have to say this film exceeded them and then some. It was nice seeing the return of the plasma-rifle future that was depicted in T1 and T2 (i missed those purpley-blue laser bolts in SALVATION!) I liked the clever nods to the original Terminator. The first quarter of the film was a lot of fun seeing some very sharply recreated scenes.... And then it takes a twist....A twist that i am sure will tick off a lot of long-time fans, but i admire this film for taking that twist. It took guts! And this film does take risks.. The FX on the T-800 were much much improved over the ""youthinizing"" effects from Salvation. But enough about that, lets get to the acting. Emilia Clarke is well-cast as Sarah Connor. She has the look of Linda Hamilton, and is able to pull off a more youthful version of T2 Sarah quite well. Jai Courtney is no Michael Biehn, but he is a likable enough Kyle Reese.I quite liked Jason Clarke as battle-hardened John Connor. He was very well-cast. I was surprised how much emotion i felt for the relationship of the heroes with the Terminator. This was a surprisingly good film, and good entry in the series.",Terminator Genisys
273,Derek237,Does something new with the Terminator franchise,7,4 July 2015,"I won't say this is a masterpiece by any means but there is a large part of me that really admires this movie for trying something different. If you're very anal about continuity, the movie is probably maddening. But the timeline in the series is just so messed up, and barely makes sense, so here's a movie that just kind of dumped trying to connect everything together and went off on its own alternate timeline, paradoxal tangents. For the first time in this series we have our doubts about who exactly plays what role, even John Connor, who for 4 movies was shaped up to be this great hero, has things turn out a little differently for him (if you saw any of the trailers, the surprise is unfortunately given away). It takes guts to switch things up like that.Emilia Clarke was great as Sarah Connor. Like anyone else I immediately felt the urge to compare her to Linda Hamilton, but this character, being from an alternate timeline, is just so different that it became a non-issue. I thought her chemistry with Arnold Schwarzenegger, playing the ""Guardian"" character, was the best thing about the movie.The worst thing about the movie? Probably Jai Courtney. He has no personality whatsoever. They should have cast someone else. ANYONE else. He sucked. I would probably like the movie a whole lot better if it were anyone else starring in the role of Kyle Reese.But hey, anyone going into this movie is going into it for Arnold and to hopefully get some good action scenes. It has both those things, so on the lowest common denominator it succeeds in that.I think they could have been a lot more innovative with the action scenes. We don't just want ""satisfactory"" from Terminator movies. We want ""mind-blowing.""They also could have taken the alternate universe plot elements even further and had even more fun with that but it still has some interesting switches.I enjoyed it. I wish this would be a rave review, but it has its problems. It's the best since T2, which I guess isn't saying much, but as a lifelong Terminator fan, I appreciated what this movie tried to do and the ideas that it had a lot more than #3 or #4, which were let-downs.

It was Entertaining but disappointing at the same time.I get the idea, but the story just didn't work. Note it's not much of a spoiler here since a lot of the basic plot was already descried in the media, including interviews with Arnold himself.My biggest gripe was the whole love story part seemed really fabricated and unreal. There seems to be little to no connection be tween Kyle and Sarah.We already knew these characters. It's inevitable that you are going to compare the two if you've seen the originals. They would have to be at least better actors. And they were not. Most of the supporting actors were miscast. This movie misses the magic.While I like Emilia Clarke in Game of Thrones, here she was flat out horrible; not believable at all. She is not at all how one would envision Sarah after Linda Hamilton's powerful portrayal. It looks like most of the supporting actors realized it was going to be a stinker and gave up early on; like it was just a paycheck to them.I really liked Arnold, in particular back with his one liners. I think he should give up on this one though. Come on Arny!, do a ""True Lies 2"" or something else with Tom Arnold et al. Do some new interesting projects, lets not try to squeeze anything else out of the Terminator world.Entertaining if your into the Terminator, but you'll probably feel letdown in the end..",Terminator Genisys

A 5 maybe because of the awful acting from pretty much everyone except Arnold who stays true to the traditional Terminator with a few additions. But it's arnold so I can't. It is a 6 out of 10. A good film. Thats it. And here is why... I am an old school fan but NOT a fanboy and if you daenerys butt- kissers and Arnie addicts wanna hate on my review. Go ahead. This is the truth right here. The Terminator... is NOT SUPPOSED to be FUN. He's supposed to be bad-a- s-s, dramatic, cool and entertaining in the sense of KICKING serious butt. The one liners, the cold gaze, Arnie doing his thing is ENOUGH. It always has been and that is why people return to watch Terminator 1 and 2. because those films depict exactly what he was and still is supposed to be. A bad-a-s-s. ! However here we got Emilia Clarke I had high hopes for, Jason Clarke doing his best but strikes me in NO way as a terminator due to his humanity playing WAAAAY to big a part in this and Jai Courtney who simply remains dislikable to me. The guy is a good actor but I just can't visualize him in this film. Or any film. But thats me. I got a problem with the cast. Thats all subjective. The biggest part of this film is CGI. Animated to the left and more animated stuff to the right. This would be cool if this actually felt like a terminator film and here is where I highlight the films biggest SIN! This... does in no way... feel like a terminator film. What it feels like... is the comedy cast of Hollywood finding themselves without anyone truly skilled at writing or directing in the mood to hire them. So this all jump aboard the Terminator flick hoping to cash in. I've seen so many actors in this film who have no business being in this kind of franchise and genre (what it used to be genrewise) WHY, Hollywood?!!!!? Why is comedy MANDATORY in your current film making process? Badboy music while taking mugshots? Are you serious?! Arnie smiling which makes me smile too even though I HATE myself smiling because its Terminator. WHY! What is the big deal with making films like they used to be back in the 80's and the 90's? Or early 2000 even. Why must everything be so FUNNY AND HILARIOUS and breaking up the thick, dark atmosphere that is...I don't know...the IMMINENT END OF THE FREAKING WORLD?! Oh yea... no reason to be serious at all. Nukes are gonna incinerate 7 billion people. Oh yea. Lets all smile and be happy. You hippies! STOP IT! Get off whatever weed you are smoking already and get your stuff together. This is NOT funny. This is NOT A MARVEL FILM! THIS IS NOT THOR 2! This...is not funny. This is so freaking sad and after I saw this I felt disappointed and just... almost depressed. Arnie's return has been damn good so far. Made a bunch of awesome films. But Terminator has blown up in his face as well as the fans of the first 2 films. THE TRUE FANS! A true terminator fan will adhere to the film and not just Arnie being here. Tough love, fellas. This film needs it. Hollywood NEEDS IT. This parody garbage is getting so out of control. Even Jurassic World has it. WILL YOU STOP IT ALREADY! It ruins all sense of replay value. SALVATION HAS MORE REPLAYVALUE THAN THIS! AND I DIDN'T EVEN LIKE SALVATION. Oh god. My apologies. I'm ranting more than reviewing but thats okay because I'm not a critic so I can do whatever. 6 out of 10, fellas.

""Genisys"" does and it benefits greatly from ""Star Trek treatment"", which allows to both take 3rd and 4th installment into account or completely ignore them as if they never happened.When I said the film was meant for fans of the franchise, it's already more than clear at the very opening. It gives very little exposition, relying on the viewers knowledge of the canon, footnoting the most important bits. If you know what's the story about, all you have to do is pin familiar names to new faces. If you don't then check at least the first two films prior to watching this one. Hardcore fans will also benefit from knowing the classic scenes shot-by-shot because they were used here creatively to great effect.Another thing here worth noting is the screenplay. It's obvious to me that the screenwriters invested a lot of time and hard work to get this thing going. Not only they went to some lengths to avoid as many clichés as they possibly could, they very skilfully and cleverly created a whole new story while retaining many connections to previous ones and patching most of the plot holes that bugged even the first two installments. It never feels like viewers' intelligence is being insulted and there never was a cringe moment for me here (I cringed A LOT watching ""Jupiter Ascending"" and ""Fury Road"", for instance).For all the questions about inner movie logic remaining, they are insignificant when it comes to naming the film's weaknesses. I could say that the fight scenes go on for a tad too long from time to time, but the only real letdown is Jason Clarke's portrayal of John Connor. He has ""the Bad Guy"" sign written all over his face and his smirky grin (akin to Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor) telegraphed he was up to something vile even while he was still supposed to be on the good side. That hindered what could be a seriously effective twist on the story.The rest of the cast, however, was very good and it's a pleasure to see Arnold Schwarzenegger back in form. He shows here that he can act when they let him and his comedic side provided a real boost whenever the story threatened to come to a stall. Which it hardly did. ""Terminator Genisys"" is a well crafted and a very thankful ride. If you came to ""Genisys"" to see another good Terminator flick - you'll see it. Some scenes almost matched the great horror tension from the original. That's more than this fan of the first ""Terminator"" hoped for. And let me be clear on one thing - I think ""Terminator"" from 1984. is a brilliantly made, poignant sci-fi horror that never needed sequels in the first place. But if I'm made to accept that they made ""T2"", which surpasses ""T1"" in budget but never in guts and vision, then I'm more than ready to accept ""Genisys"", which breathes a new life into, by now, an old concept.",Terminator Genisys
277,pinokiyo,The WORST Terminator in the series. Sooooo BOOOOORINNGGGGG,1,15 July 2017,"Doesn't Hollywood understand less is more? Anyone saying they enjoyed this is not a true Terminator fan. Currently this has a 6.5/10... That is WAYYYYY too high and forgiving. This is easily the WORST one in the entire franchise. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BAD. SOOOOOO BORING. I honestly rather watch that crappy McG Christian Bale Salvation than watch this mess again. Terminator Series Ranking:Terminator 2 - Terminator 1 - Terminator 3 - Terminator Salvation - Terminator Genisys (SOOOOOOOOOOOO CRAP!)I went with low expectations, obviously nothing is going to top Terminator 1 & 2, but Genisys was just soooooo damn cheese balls and lame boring actions. There is nothing cool about the film at all. I watched the film in 3D and even that didn't impress me. This film should not exist at all. It's that bad. Just judging on action scenes alone, it is not even remotely entertaining. Most of us all hated Terminator 3 for taking that previous dark tone to making Arnold really corny with the ""talk to the hand"" cheesy image... yet Terminator Genisys has taken the cornniess and cheese balls and lame action sequences to a whole new level.It's shocking the plot, acting, action, special effects were superior in the first Terminator made in 1984, and Terminator 2 in 1991... made over 24-31 years ago!!!! YET everything in this 2015 film Genisys, the special effects and acting is a major major major step backwards. It's up there with Robocop 3 (what absolute trash). The acting is sooooo bad (Jason Clarke is always in crappy movies and acts the same way... he's not a good actor), pacing is awful, no tension, absolutely horrible story. This is the most superficial plastic typical Hollywood trashy product. James Cameron makes side characters like Dr. Silberman, Miles Dyson really shine and memorable characters with their excellent acting... yet the main characters/actors in Genisys acts like third-rate characters... It's so sad. Clearly they ran out of ideas and the actions are unimaginative, they tried to recycle and bring back some nostalgia but it doesn't live up to it at all -- it's just BOOOOORING. This FILM is SOOOO Boring! I can't tell you that enough. You've been warned. It's like they even recycled ideas from Resident Evil movie, making Skynet's ""image"" like the little girl from Umbrella Corporation... This is TERMINATOR. SOOOOOO LAME!This film actually makes Terminator 3 quite decent. At least Terminator 3 had some decent action and thrills.This film is just filled with boring same old same old action and even more ridiculous unexciting generic villain... these writers/creators can't think outside the box at all. They really screwed up the plot in a whole new confusing bad way. Everything was just soo bad. There is no heart, no humor, everything in this film is flat. It was so bad I feel like throwing up thinking about the film again. Avoid at all costs.",Terminator Genisys
278,stephenstephenbyrne,There was one funny time travel joke,3,11 September 2020,"The best thing I can say about this movie is it had mildly creative product placement.While Salvation was #NotGood, the direction it took the franchise and the world it created were far more interesting than whatever the hell his was. That film may have failed but at least it tried something new, this just felt like a complete boardroom movie.",Terminator Genisys
279,midas-jacobs,Didn't redeem itself from Terminator Salvation,5,26 September 2015,"Terminator: Genisys focuses, again, on Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. The movie starts of by sending Kyle Reese back in time (to the beginning of Terminator 1) to save Sarah Connor. But in 1984 he doesn't find the Sarah from the first movie, no, he finds a well trained fighting badass. And the terminator send to kill Sarah has been killed by another terminator. When Sarah was nine she was attacked by a T- 1000, and this terminator saved her from the T- 1000. The Sarah that Reese finds also knows who Reese is and where he comes from, the future. Now that the 'Old' terminator (the one who saved Sarah) has killed the 'young' terminator they can take a chip out of the young one and use this chip to power a time machine. With this time machine they can go to the future. Sarah and her terminator were planning to go to 1997 when Skynet was originally launched. But Reese tells them that they should go to 2017, because of changes in the time line. They leave without the old terminator, because his human tissue hasn't fully grown yet after a fight. Sarah says they will meet up in the future and stop Skynet.The directing was surprisingly good. Especcialy from an action flick in these days. With th latest action movies you see a lot of shaky cam or fast edited fight scenes, but in this movie there wasn't any. I really liked that they didn't use it. What I also liked was that the director (Alan Taylor) filmed the scenes that they copied from T2 exactly like they were. The only negative part about this is that these scenes didn't really work for this movie. The action scenes weren't that great, but they weren't bad either. There wasn't really one that stuck with me. I also have some problems with the movie which I am going to say know at there after I will discuss the acting and the writing. So my problems. First of all the effects were really bad. The T-1000 of Terminator 2: Judgement day looked better than this one. the scars on Kyle Reeses body and on John Connors face just looked terribly fake. I taught that it felt forced when they tried to explain why Kyle Reese was sent back in time and not some other person. One thing that I absolutely hated was that the makers of the movie put almost all of the action scenes in the trailer. They even put in a major spoiler! I can't understand why someone would even do something like that! Here is a sort of spoiler, if you have seen the trailer then it isn't a spoiler at all, when the school bus flipped I just laughed, and not in a good way it was just so stupid. I also didn't really like the whole bridge scene. But now some good things, there are some exciting scenes, and the humor in the movie works. They way Sarah killed the T-1000 was original, and I like that in a movie.Now something more about the acting. I thought the acting was just bad. It wasn't good at all. The best performance was given by Arnold Schwarzenegger, he returned as the terminator and he fought with his crappy looking CGI version of him in this movie. But he did a good acting job at was very funny at times. Emilia Clarke is a good actress, she proved that in the series 'Game of Thrones' but in this movie it felt like she was trying to hard to be Sarah Connor, and I didn't like that. Because she was trying to hard I couldn't recognize the Sarah from the original movies in her, because of this I didn't like the character of the Sarah Emelia played. But near the middle of the movie I started to like her more. But Emelia still wasn't acting good. And now, one of the worst actors acting till today, Jai Courtney. Why did they even cast him? Why? He could have been a robot in this movie that is how much emotion he put into his character. Jason Clarke wasn't good either, but I don't really have anything to say about him. If you are going to watch the movie to see Matt Smith in it, then don't go. He only has a couple of minutes screen time and he didn't do a good acting job. The writing of the movie is OK, the jokes do work which was a really big plus for me. Another thing about the writing, because it was not good the characters didn't feel real, they were one-dimensional and that was a big min for me. SOME SPOILERS AHEAD. The only person I cared about was the Terminator, and when he sacrifices himself I felt a bit sad. But I enjoyed the movie. It is just another brainless action movie with some face plant moments and plot holes. If you are a die hard fan of the series then you might get angry at the movie. You also don't have to take the movie to serious because the movie didn't do it either. And to end this review here is a little tip: Don't watch the previous films first, watch them after this one, you will enjoy this movie more if you do this, I think so.",Terminator Genisys
280,clarkmick33,Dumb movie for dumb people,2,18 October 2015,"This movie was a true Hollywood production in a nutshell - explosions, special effects, actors and actresses that would be better to stick to modelling and old heroes (Arnie) trying to cash in their last pay check before the final curtain. So to sum it up this movie belongs on the pile of garbage with all the movies Michael Bay has made recently - Transformers Franchise.This movie just has nothing on Terminator 2 - which I can say because I saw that movie again before watching this one. In the classic Terminators (1-2) the terminators were a threat. Now they say cheesy one liners and get involved in fist fights.This movie is really superficial - no depth is added to the Terminator franchise.....I agree sadly with others that this franchise has been overdone and need to be.........well Terminated.",Terminator Genisys
281,wrightiswright,"Passable, nothing more.",6,20 December 2015,"When did the Terminator franchise degenerate into a bog-standard action movie series? Probably with the arrival of the third movie. The fourth one continued the trend, and guess what... 'Genisys' doesn't disappoint on that front, either.What is there to comment on, apart from the plentiful scenes where an aging Arnie gets his skin ripped off to reveal his metallic components, a new robot baddie model is introduced which is seemingly unstoppable, yet still gets torn to shreds in the end, and an updated Sarah Connor for the 21st century, who most definitely does NOT need saving.Shame she left all trace of charm and personality along with it, but hey-ho.It's two hour eye candy, which'll hold your attention, is moderately enjoyable in it's own undemanding way, but if you're expecting it to bring anything new to the table in terms of the themes which have already been done to death in the previous four entries...Guess again. 6/10",Terminator Genisys
282,mjplysaght,Completely forgettable,3,27 January 2017,"OK, so when this film was announced, people were hyped. Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor? Matt Smith playing a supporting role? Arnold coming back? This had a bunch of people excited. However, as they released more and more promotional trailers, the production team eventually just shot themselves in the foot. When you put your big spoiler/twist in your damn trailer, what reason to we have to come and see the film? Basically, this film tries to be a reboot, literally rewriting the timeline of the original Terminator films. Kyle Reese gets sent back in time to protect Sarah, like we've seen in the original film. However, John Connor gets infected by Skynet, now an all-powerful Terminator, played by Matt Smith. Meanwhile, Kyle arrives in 1984 about to be killed by a T-1000 dressed as a cop (sound familiar?) until suddenly Sarah Connor (now already hardened and confident) comes to save him.The timeline has been altered so that now Arnie was sent back in time to protect Sarah as a child so she is already used to the threat of Skynet. For some reason, they travel forward to the present day where this new app Genisys (simple spell check, guys) is about to launch, connecting all devices. We find out that Genisys is actually Skynet and Terminator John Connor tries to intercept our heroes and at this point, I just checked out.It's the same recycled plot at this point. The worst thing about this film is that it tries to rewrite the timeline of the two films in the series that people actually enjoyed. Every attempt to keep the inevitable Judgement Day at bay is pointless. There's only so much you can do without making this series completely convoluted, which sums up this movie entirely.What I want to know is how much did they pay James Cameron to praise the film in the promotional trailers? It only emphasizes what is wrong with Hollywood in the present day. Films are no longer made to be praised as a standalone project, they have to be part of an already existing franchise or cinematic universe.There's no point milking this cashcow anymore.",Terminator Genisys
283,Minerva_Meybridge,Riddled with Plot holes - Poor Casting,5,9 July 2015,"While the special effects were excellent, the writing was so sub par it was subterranean.No 1. In the beginning, Kyle Reese, the apparent narrator, says that he was born after Judgment Day. Yet it was clearly established in the Sarah Connor Chronicles that Kyle Reese was about nine or ten when Judgment Day occurred. Now there are those who will contend that by sending Reese back in time, it postponed Judgment Day, but if that were the case and John Connor is the son of Kyle Reese...oh, this is giving me a headache.No. 2. If everything went the same as in the original Terminator movie, who sent back a reprogrammed Terminator to rescue Sarah Connor and where did Skynet get another time machine and why wouldn't it have followed the original protocol in Terminator 2?No. 3 The creation of a human being is based upon one egg united with one sperm. Every time a man ejaculates, there are billions of sperm. The odds of the same egg and sperm uniting with all the changes in time are uncounted trillions to one. John Connor would have been erased from the moment Sarah's life was interfered with as a child.No. 4. It was established that John Connor was compromised the moment Kyle Reese was sent back. So, who sent ""Pops"" back in time to save Sarah? And how did Skynet, on the brink of destruction have time to create a liquid metal T-1000, and why the hell would Skynet even bother to give its cyborgs human designations? Wouldn't it just be assigned some binary code?No. 5. But now that John Connor has become the worst person in human existence, why did anyone bother to try and save him in the first place? The resistance would have been better off had he never existed.No. 6. This version of Sarah Connor is a whole lot weaker and stupider than any of the others. Why would either she have any feelings for John Connor? She never gave birth to him; never met him. It's like someone telling you that Adolf Hitler is going to be your son and you hesitate for a moment not killing him? She should have had no ties to him whatsoever. She's also younger than Linda Hamilton As for the casting, John Clarke is awful. First off, he doesn't look like a john Connor, but rather like Conan O'Brien. He most certainly doesn't look anything like his supposed parents and he doesn't have the likability that Edward Furlong did or Thomas Dekker. Nor does he have the commanding presence of Christian Bale. Jai Courtney in about as lifeless as he was in A Good Day to Die Hard, which was a yawn and a half in and of itself.That being said, I still liked Emilia Clarke and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who looks much better with silver gray hair than with the dyed reddish brown mop he normally sports. And J.K. Simmons was good as well. But I would have preferred them to have brought Robert Patrick back, at least through CGI than the T-1000 that replaced him.In the end, both Sarah and Kyle give young Kyle things to remember, but since the time line has now been altered, none of that matters. And you would think that Kyle would have wanted to tell his parents who he really is. Martin Sloan tried in the Twilight Zone episode, ""Walking Distance."" In fact that was the first thing he did.All in all, T-5 is a predictable, poorly written, poorly cast film that is entertaining, but hurts your head when you try to make sense of it all. They would have been better off if they had picked up where the Sarah Connor Chronicles left off. But then, where would Ahhhnold have been?",Terminator Genisys

The premise was intriguing, but the trailers revealed too much, and watching the film had few surprises. The script was a major weakness of Terminator, because it left things unexplained, revisited way too much old material from previous films, and was way too overly complex. Along with the story, the dialogue was at times forced, and tried to remind us of older, better days, for the franchise.

While he's probably never going to be the star who carries the entire load again, he's the nigh on perfect foil for uninteresting young leads.Speaking of which, who cast this epic? I realize that in a modern Hollywood obsessed with making little girls he-men it's not easy being the lead male. Never mind. I guess he was okay. Her, enh.There comes a time when script and story writers get lost in the fandom of a certain ""world"", and not wanting to bore the core audience, invariably pile on ""unexpected"" twists and turns. This one's full of them. Far more than necessary in my book.Then again, that might be because like nearly all modern action movies, this one is at least 20 minutes too long.Long story short, (after telling the long story), Arnold and J.K.

There are so many subtle nuances that are sheer genius that made T2 one of the best films ever produced! After T2, the entire Terminator franchise has become a joke, a sad sad joke! Now we come to Terminator Genisys! The ONLY reason Emilia Clarke got the role as Sarah Connor is to cash in on the popularity of GOT! But, the idiot producers didn't take into consideration she can't act and even in GOT she is annoying. So now we are suppose to believe Sarah Connor is an extremely short stocky girl who doesn't have the same crazy aggression and backbone that the original Sarah Connor had! I'm sorry but Emilia Clarke sickens me as Sarah Connor! Yes, the Terminator has uttered the most recognizable catch phrases like ' I'll be back"" which was classic but the producers of Genysis desperately attempted to conjure up memorable ""catch phrases"" to boost the popularity of the movie and ""failed"" miserably! As for the storyline, I could pick it to pieces and not in a good way that creates discussion! The storyline is utter rubbish and an absolute insult to any thinking person! Yes, the effects are good as expected from today's technology, but a movie can't rely on good effects! I wonder what incentive Cameron had to endorse this film? My thoughts are that the producers of the failed terminator movies used Cameron's disapproval as an excuse for poor ratings! So now Cameron has endorsed this crappy movie to prove he has nothing to do with the ratings!! Cameron is a genius and the only reason the terminator is so popular is because of him!

To me this one was just more fun, now I don't hate the others with the exception of The Sarah Connor Chronicles that show at lest in season one was pretty good but I felt the writers on that show was starting to play with fire in season two,because I think they didn't have enough ideas and it showed but more on that with another review.This film I personally enjoyed through and through the action scenes were very well done with cool twist and turns and a pretty cool ending.Now I know some of you didn't like this because of the PG-13 rating but this film focuses more on the fun factor then the dark tone or blood and guts.

Everything is kind of half-@$$ed and nothing really works. The inspirations of the cinematography is obvious with people horrors that look and act like they were ripped straight out the extras cast for The Ring. For something that is supposed to be horror the writers fail to make any characters you will care about. They are just thrown on the screen with barely any introduction and occasional allusions to past events behind current group tensions. Even the magical world-saving MacGuffin was introduced with such a whiplash inducing corner turn that I had to waste precious braincells remembering that it had been alluded to once an hour earlier. Most of the ""twists"" are from so far out in left field that you are left wondering what just happened. I could almost forgive the poor acting if these were a bunch of people new to Hollywood but the stars all have filmographies in the double digits and their delivery of lines is as a wooden as the stars of a grade school play. Heck, I've seen porn with better developed plots than this offal.I generally have no problem watching B movies and have enjoyed more than a few amateur forays into film. Movies like this give low-budget a bad name. Much better can be done but who wants to gamble if things like this are what you see when you wander off the big-budget blockbuster release path.

294,CaressofSteel75,Time Travel Means Never Having to Say You're Sorry,5,9 April 2018,"What you have here is a sequel and partial series reboot mashed into one movie. How else do you inject fresh interest into a franchise that's covered every possible angle of it's basic storyline going back to 1984? The only thing to do is recast some key roles- here it's Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese played by Emilia Clark and Jai Courtney, respectively- and then you tell the audience that some previously unknown actions by Skynet have changed the past. This allows you to go back and replay part of the original story with a different outcome. In order to do that trick, you do have to make logic stand on its head. (and yes, we all understand that you throw logic out the window in a time travel sci fi flick). Probably the worst diversion off the Terminator track was using this alternative past time line to turn John Connor into the main villain as a part man/part robot working for Skynet. This is actually pretty jarring to people who understood the symbolism of the earlier movies. John Connor has always represented JC himself. And the Terminator- definitely a kind of a prophet or an angel, existing in a place between God and man. (And not all angels are good guys). If you're not familiar with this allegory in this series, then consider the one line that's uttered in every one of these movies: ""Come with me if you want to live.""A lot of people probably also won't like the new Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. Their interplay in this comes off like two post millennial wiseacres- nothing like the characters sounded like in 1984. All of this just adds up to a confusing mess punctuated with the same type of super-action we've seen in every one of these movies. But, as we know, time travel means you never have to say you're sorry for the plot disruptions in something like this. It shows Hollywood's creative engine grinding to a halt. At least Arnold's in this one.",Terminator Genisys

No matter if they are nit useful to us, most of us doesn't want to part with those things and still try to connect with them. That is how the Terminator Genisys looks like. Terminator always has the safe plot. Once again moving in and out of the past-future concept, this movie tries to keep audience interested and keep the plot alive to continue the saga as well. This has everything first part, the judgment day and a start which almost reminds one of Terminator Salvation. It tries to connect the old movies and change things like how it happened with Xmen: Days of Future Past, but not so well. Though action sequences are not such a highlight, the movie has some plus points. Arnold's role is well written for his age. He does give his usual robotic best. Jai Courtney and Emilia Clarke stay amused throughout the movie. Jason Clarke is good but he should have had a better role. JK Simmons plays another version of his Spiderman movies. With some crisp editing, detailed storyline and with some more effort put into, I don't see why they should not continue to the Terminator franchise.

297,aaronjbong,"""Genisys"" is a new Genesis for the Terminator",7,26 June 2015,"""Terminator: Genisys"", a reboot/sequel that serves as a modern upgrade to the original Terminator movie. In this beefed-up summer popcorn flick, Arnold Schwarzenegger returns once again as a Terminator re-programmed and sent back in time to protect, once again, a figure of great importance to the Human Resistance, who in the future will be engaged in a massive war against the machines of Skynet. But this time, it concerns the Sarah Connor, mother of the human leader John Connor, and this time, he's been there since she was a little girl. So when Kyle Reese is sent back in time to protect Sarah, he becomes confused that Sarah is already aware of Skynet, his arrival and her destiny. This means that the past has been changed and the future is yet to be determined. Time traveling is a tricky plot device, and this movie uses it extensively (multiple timelines) that it not only tangles the plot, but also our brains. It's all very confusing to follow, especially for those who are not devout sci-fi fans, because the film doesn't really spend that much time trying to ensure audiences get a fully thorough understanding of the situation. However, there is one plot twist that I appreciated, (but too bad the trailers revealed it), and that concerns John Connor. Because this time, John Connor has become a Terminator. Yes, he is the villain. I thought this was a smart move and put the movie in new territory, by having its supposed protagonist turn into an antagonist. It introduces something fresh to the franchise and the possibility of creating a conflict that is more personal and engaging to the two main leads. However, I felt the film didn't really utilize this opportunity to create a much more enticing John Connor, instead just depicting him as a simply a more advanced Terminator who simply talks a lot more. Despite the underused John Connor, Jason Clarke delivered a terrific performance, giving us a Terminator that is imposing and someone we all want to run away from. There are many action sequences in the film and while none of them bring as much suspense as the first two Terminator films, they are still exciting. Granted, this is rated PG-13, so there's no split-head from T2. There are more evil Terminators present here; there's the T-1000 (liquid metal), T-800 (younger Arnold Schwarzenegger), and John Connor himself. I really enjoyed the one sequence where old Schwarzenegger faced off against his younger self, I thought that was a bit nostalgic and just simply awesome to watch see Schwarzenegger fight himself. I also found John Connor's abilities to be visually stunning and sophisticated (nanotechnology). However, it may sound odd but the visual effects of the T-1000 didn't look that pleasing as compared to the one present in T2. Perhaps they rushed it?Schwarzenegger headlines a new group of cast members. As he has always done in the previous Terminator movies, Schwarzenegger delivers an excellent performance as the T-800 that it seems like this is the role he is born to play. His deadpan delivery of the dialogue also proves to be a major component of the humor incorporated in the film. Jason Clarke, as previously said, is terrific in portraying the revamped antagonistic John Connor. Jai Courtney was fitting as Kyle Reese, and his personality of being quite brash is spot-on. Emilia Clarke was appropriate as Sarah Connor, making her a strong female character but not quite on par with Linda Hamilton, though.Overall, ""Terminator: Genisys"" delivers in the action department and is sure to keep us entertained for a good two hours. It provides a good foundation for future sequels to build upon, although I think it's about time to retire the ""go-back-in-time-to-save-someone"" arc. It doesn't measure up to the first two Terminators but is a vast improvement from the recent two dreadful installments.",Terminator Genisys

Also the same girl is able to support the terminator with her body, helping him to move. Oh God what a tragedy of a movie.No character development, everybody moved around like stone statues, no feelings whatsoever about any of the characters in the movie. The Terminator movie is supposed to be a horror thriller genre, not bore us to death with mediocre CGI, funny faces and stupid jokes.This is a mash up of all the Terminator movies and TV series, all thrown together in one horrible production of a film. They probably couldn't come up with any new ideas so they just took all the previous ideas and glued them together.It's not horror, it's not a thriller, it's not a sci-fi film, it certainly is not close to being an adventure movie. So what is it ? I'll tell you exactly what it is. It's a chicken soup which has been reheated for the 5th time and we just can't eat it anymore.It's the worst Terminator film so far almost in every aspect. CGI sucks, no story, no thrilling moments, no characters, the dates keep going back and forth, double memories, strange interaction between the actors. Just a huge mess.This doesn't even qualify for a mediocre TV series.I bet you that not even Arnold knows what the hell is going on in this movie.",Terminator Genisys
299,Jim-Eadon,Horrible Retread,3,24 October 2015,"The first two Terminator movies were the up there with the greatest action / sci-fi movies of all time. The stories were gripping, suspenseful, brilliant and compelling. The third was bad, but occasionally entertained. The fourth was just dreadful. And just as I thought the series could not get worse we get this. I abhorred the pacing, the direction, the casting, the plot. The lead characters had neither charisma nor chemistry. the girl never seemed in the slightest bit frightened or horrified despite the terrifying and traumatic situations she was placed in. If she was not scared, how could we be concerned for her survival? At one point she was hauled from a falling bus but did not so much as rubbed her skinny shoulders and arms, which would have been severely injured, having held her own weight plus that of a hefty, muscular male. The very same bus had gone hurtling 50 feet through the air shortly before. The dialogue was flat and false. The enemy terminators were not in the slightest bit scary. There was never any sense that the main characters were in any danger. The action was generic, seen-it-all-before CGI tedium. I love action sci-fi movies but this was bland corporate movie-making-by-accountants nonsense. The multiple references to the first two movies only went to emphasise how bad this movie was compared to those.",Terminator Genisys
300,brutzel,Best Terminator Ever,9,13 November 2015,"We all remember the Terminator movies, right? Okay, was Arnold a good guy or a bad guy? Do you remember John Connor? Okay then how about Kyle Reese? You know what Skynet was, right? Hmmmmm..thought so. But you do remember shape-shifting T1000 played by Robert Patrick, right? Most remember a couple things: Arnold saying he'll be back, the John Connor and Sarah Conner names being bandied about; Cyborgs trying to kill Sarah Connor to prevent the human race from surviving, and the annoying can-almost-never-be-killed Cyborg T1000 that Robert Patrick played. That's about it. Anyway, here we are again dealing with intrusive timelines. Yes, it will be difficult to keep the timelines straight so just sit back and enjoy this along with the spectacular CGI that we all thought couldn't get any better. Wow is all I can say!Well, guess what? John Connor (Jason Clarke) again sends Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) to guard Sara Connor (Emilia Clarke), but in this new timeline Kyle allies himself with Sarah's Guardian ""Pops"" (Schwarzenegger) and both fight to protect Sara Connor and to destroy Skynet. See in various timelines the same thing can be done again, and again and well, you get the idea. Think of timelines as Ground Hot Days. This time the story changes big time and you will be fully engaged. Kyle and Pops don't often see eye-to-eye and the banter between them is funny at times. When Pops goes off talking about too many scientific possibilities, Kyle tells Sarah he needs to find Pop's off button. There were other good funny lines throughout. Very good.The acting all around is excellent and I, for one, would give an Oscar to Arnold Schwarzenegger for Best Actor. He was terrific as this may be his best role ever. Wouldn't mind Jason Clarke being awarded Best Supporting Actor. All were good but these two really stood out as did the CGI. You have never seen CGI like this. (you say that all the time)In the beginning I asked how much you remembered about the Terminator movies? Well, you gave the deer in the headlights look. Sad. However, this is one of the best or the best Terminator movies ever and this one you will remember because the story is so much better, more humanistic (did you really reach for that Kleenex at times?) and there is closureI believe..um..pretty sure.And yes, you will remember this movie for a long time because it is very, very good, easy to follow and there is a very big twist you won't see coming, and that Arnold is a good-guy Cyborg in this. How good is that? (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Briefly partial. Language: A couple F-bombs in the beginning. Nothing the rest of the way.",Terminator Genisys

It reveals the whole plot actually the trailer is a major spoiler. How low the IQ of that person should be to make such trailer? And how low the IQs of those who are responsible for quality control that they let that moron get away with it. As for the movie, I guess it's ok, surely not as impressive as the originals, the modifications are ridiculous, but we get a few good laughs from Arnold, he sort of parodies himself who shows that he is actually a cool person/actor. Emilia was also ok.",Terminator Genisys
302,culmo80,Totally Unnecessary,4,20 June 2016,"I like Arnold. Even though most of his movies are kind of dumb, I still enjoy them. But Terminator Genysis really is bad.While Terminator Salvation wasn't great, it at least didn't make time travel the central theme, like this film. In fact, this is the first film to adopt the ""Back to the Future"" zaniness of time travel as part of the core plot. Time travel was simply a means to get the main players on the stage in the first three films, and the fourth dealt entirely with the war between humanity and the machines. No, this film has our main characters going backwards, forwards ... ugh....Yes there are spoilers below:The first problem with this film, in my mind, was the lead for Jon Connor. Nothing against the guy who played him, but he just didn't fit. I don't know what it is, but I couldn't buy him as the leader of the resistance. I have no idea who played the adult Jon Connor from T2, but that guy at least looked the part. Surely, they could have found someone better. Anyway, what happens in this installment of the Terminator series is a total unraveling of everything that came before. In a bad way. While it was cool to see the final future battle and the use of the time machine, that's where it kind of went off the rails. Apparently, Skynet knew immediately when it sent the ""first"" Terminator through that it failed. So, somehow, it was able to send through a few more terminators ... all of which would end up failing as well. So then it decides to take control of Jon Connor's body and then send him back to jumpstart Skynet in 2017. Honestly, it's getting to be that Skynet is a B-horror movie monster. No matter how many ways you kill it, it will just return in some absurd fashion in the next sequel!I will say that I enjoyed the 1984 part of the film. It was fun to see them recreate the original in so many ways. But aside from that, there were so many odd moments of forced humor (Bad Boys song during the mug shot sequence? This isn't 1988). And the plot just got to be so so weird. And that's where it fell apart:Since Sarah and Kyle are stuck in 2017, that means Jon Connor can never be born without them returning to 1984 ... unless this film intends to totally do away with the character entirely, replacing him with Kyle Reese as the guy who somehow saves humanity. Either way, it renders Sarah Connor irrelevant as well.If Skynet (in the beginning of the film) knew the T-800 would fail, it then sends over at least one T-1000, and a T-3000 (or whatevr). Why not just send those in the first place?JJ Simons character was really forced. Yep, it just happened to be one of the cops in 1984 LA who encountered Reese ... and 33 years later, he happens to be a detective in San Francisco ... because of course he was.If ""Pops"" was able to get on the construction crew for the new Cyberdyne building, wouldn't he be somewhat aware of the ""secret"" basement where Skynet's core really was (as shown in the mid-credits scene)?Etc etc etc",Terminator Genisys

It's a decent Sci-Fi action movie but fans will either really love it or dismiss it.
As a Terminator fan I enjoyed it ... a decent if not controversial story, great action and excellent CGI is a bonus.

304,ikrani,Has Film Quality Dropped or Are People Just Spoiled Now?,9,29 July 2015,"The last time Angry Joe was the only internet critic I could find who liked a particularly divisive film, said film was Man of Steel, which I just accepted as him being Angry Joe and therefore being more forgiving than everyone else.But now all of those same critics are hating Genisys for ""lacking humanity"" or the like, and since my opinion is what arbitrarily decides whose critiques are more legit, I find myself wondering if people have just gotten spoiled by the recent deluge of films like The Winter Soldier, Days of Future Past or any number of Oscar-bait pictures. If Genisys had come out in the 1980s with the same story and characters it has now, in an era where story in action movies was secondary to action and good acting was all but unheard of, I've no doubt this would've been placed up there with the likes of Commando or Highlander.Just a warning: I won't be spoiling anything that the trailers didn't already and in order for me to properly showcase the film I'll have to discuss things that are revealed more than halfway in.Anyway, the film. I really like it. There are few films that compel me to see them 3 times in theaters and the last one was Guardians of the Galaxy. I kept going back to it partially because I found the alternate timeline to be fascinating in how the one simple act of Skynet compromising John Connor and thereby adding the element of human ingenuity to its arsenal (where all other Terminator films had Skynet falling back on the same failed plan time and time again) could change so much. In that one scene, we not only get human ingenuity, but the filmmakers also gave Skynet the ability to plan for failure, as said act against John comes only AFTER the human resistance blew up its central core and shut down its army.However, in changing the timeline in its attempt to kill Sarah Connor as a child (remember, Skynet has human ingenuity now), Skynet inadvertently erased itself from existence. Remember how in the trailer where Old Arnie goes to sort out Young Arnie from T1? Well, he does, and by doing so removes the thing that allowed Skynet to be built in the first place. So Skynet elects to send John Connor back to construct itself at a later period, hoping that whoever sent Old Arnie to protect Kid Sarah will know the old date for Judgement Day and so whoever gets sent to stop it will show up wondering where Skynet is. Meanwhile, Skynet elects to construct itself in 2017, where rampant social media and everyone posting their every thought online means that not only will Skynet be created out of convenience (the film comments on how everyone these days will jump on a new idea if it makes life the slightest bit easier), but it will have a massive database on nearly everyone in the first and second world, a ready- made psychiatric profile for Skynet to exploit in its quest to find and terminate all humans.And, of course, the action is pretty cool, the characters were okay (people say they have zero chemistry; people say the same thing about Edward and Bella and the characters in this film are nothing like Twilight's deadpan cast), and Arnie as Pops was EASILY the funniest part of the film. Here, he's more actively playing the role of a robotic infiltrator instead of just using it as an excuse for his lackluster acting chops.I'd give this film a 10/10 if not for two things. First, there's a scene in which Genisys talks to a press conference with its innocent child-voice. The scene adds nothing to the story or characters nor does it allow the movie to breathe after an intense action scene. Second, one cannot appreciate how well Genisys handles the changes to its own timeline if one hasn't seen the first two Terminator films. Even so, I still enjoyed it, and the only reason I can see as to why critics don't like it is because they weren't paying attention, as a lot of their questions were answered by the film.Still, I found the film to be a satisfying third installment, as James Cameron was spot-on when he said he considers Genisys to be the true Terminator 3.",Terminator Genisys
305,Maladjusted_1,The most enjoyable 'Terminator' in a quarter-century,7,13 July 2016,"It appears that 'Terminator Genisys' has been widely criticised as a reboot that shouldn't have happened. Although I agree that it doesn't live up to the quality of the first two films in the franchise, it manages to bring several new things to the table, bravely stepping out of the shadow of the original titles. For this reason, I think 'Genisys' is the most enjoyable 'Terminator' film in 25 years. It brings a charming sort of self-awareness to the franchise: leather jackets, motorcycles and action-hero catchphrases aren't as impressive as they were in the 1980s, and the writers seem aware of this. Although I appear to be defending the film, I have a few criticisms. Firstly, I don't really like Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor. She doesn't bring enough charisma or ferocity to the role, and whenever she shares the screen with another actor, she immediately fades into the background. Also, the action scenes aren't as good as those in the first two 'Terminator' films, but I suppose allowances have to be made when the lead actor is almost 70 years old. Overall, however, I think 'Genisys' is a solid entry in the franchise. It reflects on the history of the series (especially its first instalment), and has a number of surprisingly poignant scenes which I think 'Terminator' (and Arnie) fans will like.",Terminator Genisys
306,Tyson14,Arnold carries the film on his shoulders,7,17 August 2015,"With audiences growing far more wary of, and sometimes downright venomous towards remakes, studios have been searching for new ways to reinvigorate recognisable brands. The answer has been something comic book fans have been all too familiar with for some time: the retcon. Or put another way, the re imagining. You don't have to totally start over, just ignore or delete enough stuff to basically start from a difference place. It's a tricky thing to pull off without alienating your entire fan base. X-Men: Days of Future Past managed to use alternate timelines to build an entirely new history for its heroic mutants. But what about something like James Cameron's Terminator; a cold metal sci-fi classic that basically forged our understanding of time travel in modern genre movies? Terminator Genisys, the fifth movie in the vaunted franchise, attempts to embrace and completely devastate everything we know and love about James Cameron's time-bending story, and as one might expect the results are a bit scattershot.Rest assured Terminator Genisys better than the maligned Terminator Salvation which I happen to like, and a fair bit more like a true Cameron Terminator movie. Despite the narrative pretzel it twists into, the film has all of the recognisable nuts and bolts, literally in the case of Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800, who was notably absent from 'Salvation' except for a lousy CGI version. This time around the hard-to-kill cyborg is considered a ""guardian"" rather than a terminator, sent back in time to protect the life of Sarah Connor, played now by Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke, sporting her ""Mother of Dragons"" attitude. So how does something like that work? The story begins as we expect. Future rebel badass John Connor (Jason Clarke) leads a human resistance against Skynet and its army of killer machines. When Skynet realises it will lose, it sends a terminator to 1984 to kill Sarah while she's weak. So John calls upon his pal Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) to go back in time to protect Sarah from harm. Oh, and let's not forget that John also needs his buddy to sleep with his mom so he can be born in the first place. Don't forget that little detail; it makes for some awkward sitcom shenanigans later on.Things take a turn when Kyle arrives in 1984 only to discover that Sarah doesn't really need his help. She's already one tough soldier; she's gone full-blown Linda Hamilton (minus the biceps) and has been protected by the Arnold T-800 since she was a child, nicknaming him ""Pops"". How? Why? And is that wrinkled skin and graying hair on the Terminator? What? The explanations are convoluted, bog down the story, and frankly are a little ridiculous, but fortunately this film doesn't slow down enough for you to analyse whether it makes sense. There's always a new Terminator to fight (there are a few, including one that has been spoiled by desperate marketing), a new bus to flip, another helicopter chase through the city, and the CGI-heavy action looks great courtesy of director Alan Taylor. He keeps the pace moving faster than a T-1000 can shapeshift forms; those who simply want to watch robots fight and stuff get blown up will leave very happy. Not to say he's quite on Cameron's level when it comes to blending digital and real-world effects but the film looks impressive.But there's also no denying that the screenplay is often too eager to shock us, piling on one unnecessary twist after the next to make the story more confusing than it really needs to be. All of this serves as needless distraction because the bones of the story are straight forward. Jump to a specific place in time and blow something up. Pretty simple. While all of the key characters we expect are present and accounted for, one thing that the film can't replicate is the unique familial dynamic established between Sarah and the T-800. 'Genisys' tries but Clarke and Schwarzenegger don't have the chemistry to establish the kind of relationship that made Cameron's movies so emotional. We gave a damn when the T-800 was willing to sacrifice his life for the Connors' future. That ""thumbs up"" really meant something! But here the callbacks are too self-aware, too telegraphed; like the screenwriters had the ""I'll be back"" moment thought out months in advance and couldn't wait to drop it on us. They also couldn't wait to hit us with some really misplaced humour. While there's nothing wrong with a bit of levity to lighten the end-of-the-world circumstances, but most of it centres on Reese's need to mate with Sarah, while ""Pops"" judges him harshly like Robert De Niro in Meet the Parents. It's weird, and not in a good way. There are other strange comedic diversions, including an appearance by JK Simmons as a robot-obsessed cop. That said; Schwarzenegger brings a few moments of genuine tenderness, while Emilia Clarke does a decent job of filling Hamilton's shoes. Courtney thrives at the physical stuff; tell him to fire a gun at something shiny and he can do it, but he's not much for the deeper side of acting yet.In what must feel like the tagline for Schwarzenegger's latter career, the T-800 constantly asserts, ""I am old, not obsolete."" At 25 years, Cameron's Terminator is an ""old"" franchise no matter how many times they try to revive it. But Terminator Genisys, despite it not always making a ton of sense, is still the best and most relevant Terminator film since 'Judgement Day', and that means it will never be considered obsolete.",Terminator Genisys
307,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,"T2 Quote - ""Now I know Why you Cry.""",2,16 June 2016,"Yeah, because I saw Terminator: Genesh*ts. Awful, doesn't make sense. We know this movie was trying to be like J.J. Abrams Star Trek & X-Men Days of Future Past, but I believe it fails miserably. The only thing enjoyable, is about the first 20 minutes or so. Everything up to 1984 Arnold vs old Arnold. After that it takes a ferocious dump, on fans of the original Terminator films. Arnold Schwarzenegger is once again enjoyable as the Terminator, and is the only reason I'm not giving this a one star. Why couldn't they just pick up from where Salvation left off, instead of having a movie showing us Terminator the greatest hits? With some rewrites this movie could have been great. I think it is time for the Terminator franchise to shake things up. For instance, instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger being pops, how about he is the human being that the terminators concept is based on? Maybe he is even based off Sarah Connors father. Whom she never met? Maybe we get a new Terminator, Vin Diesel, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Keanu Reeves, etc. After this I hope James Cameron can make one more spectacular Terminator film we deserve, and end the franchise the way it deserves to end.

309,OlieRendch,Terminator!....You know...again!,6,8 July 2015,"So one of the most referenced things in pop culture returns for it's fifth movie in the form of Terminator Genisys (with a Y). Schwarzenegger is back and joins a load of new cast in a new timeline doing old stuff in new ways. Basically, plot-wise, a Terminator was sent back in time to protect child Sarah Connor before the events of The Terminator and so when Kyle Reese is sent back in time to protect adult Sarah Connor it's all changed, and then of course - as you see in every piece of promotion for this film - John Connor goes back in time but is a Terminator-like being now. If you think that's confusing then....yeah, you're right, it is. As a whole this film does not feel like a Termiantor film, a lot of the opening does but for the majority it's just a fun, action- packed, sci-fi movie that in some places feels a little jumbled. It doesn't run smooth all the time, it goes from a giant action piece to a weird comedy skit with ironic music and then a suspenseful part and individually they're all really entertaining but it just doesn't fit a lot of the time.All the actors are great in it, Arnie does the famous killer robot brilliantly for a fourth time and Emilia Clarke does well not only acting but is some eye candy if you get bored of the plot; Jai Courtney is pretty good too but doesn't have the widest acting range of all time and Jason Clarke plays a good villain. Two people who were also in it I felt odd with, the first being J.K. Simmons who is a fantastic actor is misused as an almost bumbling old guy who is a third-party observer to all the events; and then Matt(hew) Smith is actually really good but his American accent kept taking me out of the film somewhat, can't see why they couldn't have kept him British.Special effects were all top-noch too, especially the opening scenes and the climactic battle. All-in-all although it was fun, entertaining and set up one or two points in case there is a sequel, it did have a few fan-fiction vibes and if you haven't seen the other films then... you really are gonna be stuck for at least half the movie.",Terminator Genisys
310,keithlovesmovies,Terminator Genesis Review,7,2 July 2015,"This movie starts off in the future. Judgement day has arisen. Human are at war with an artificial intelligence named Skynet and the machines it controls. When John Connor, leader of the human resistance, sends Kyle Reese to 1984 to protect his mother, Sarah, from a Terminator assassin, an unexpected turn of events creates an altered timeline where things are not what we thought they were. Since being orphaned by a Terminator, Sarah has since been brought up by another Terminator programmed to protect her. This Terminator has then trained her to face her destiny. Now, aided by the reprogrammed old Terminator, Sarah and Kyle together must overcome and survive the T-1000 and an unexpected enemy sent by Skynet from the future to kill them. With the past changed as we know it, the three must find a new way to save the future and take the fight to Skynet.At least I think that was how it went. I will admit that I had a hard time following what was going on but I will admit that I eventually did. And what they did may complicate things for long time Terminator fans. I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger hasn't lost his touch as the older Terminator and he still can hold his own with everyone else on screen. If you happen to not be a fan of the Terminator series, this is still an entertaining action movie. I thought it was a really good looking movie, the effects are high quality from the machines to the different Terminator models, the action is entertaining, and the acting was mostly solid throughout. Sure certain things didn't make sense, or they rushed through a few parts without explanation, or the 2 leads may have been miscast but that's not the point here. You're not supposed to overthink these things, to better enjoy this movie, you just have to accept things in the way that they are presented to you. If you haven't seen the first 2 movies, you may miss out on a few references. Fans of the Terminator series should remain engaged because this movie covers everything one would want from the Terminator checklist: Connors, Terminators, time travel, etc. Even if you haven't seen any of the Terminator movies, you will get an enjoyable action movie with some explosions and excitement. This movie isn't quite the same level as the first 2 James Cameron movies but it is the best of the rest. It isn't the best action movie this year but is another solid addition to the Terminator series. Action and sci-fi movie fans will not be disappointed.keithlovesmovies.com",Terminator Genisys
311,baehr_adam,There's No Fate But What We Make For Ourselves.,10,4 July 2015,Wow I will start by saying that I really enjoyed this movie. I mean out of the 5 movies I would rank it 3rd. I would say #1 is T2 and #2 is the original and the last 2 are up for debate. I will start with the story which is the hardest part to grasp as it combines all of the movies and mixes them up. I mean they go through 3 different time periods so I will say it was an alright story plot for the fact that they did mix it up from the original formula. I will move onto the acting. I mean Arnold is a Beast like always and as for Sarah Connor who is played by Emilia Clarke from Game of Thrones I thought she felt out of place compared to Linda Hamilton. We also have Jason Clarke as John who I personally loved. I will finish in the acting department with Jai Courtney as Reese who I thought did a decent job considering he had to fill Michael Biehn's shoes which is almost Impossible lolz but he did a good job. I will finish with the action department and say that it was Fantastic and the CGI was used to perfection I thought. I also loved how they incorporated the T-1000 for a little while. I mean it had that Nostalgia that brought me back and I loved that for sure. I would also say that the movie had a decent amount of humor. I will now close out with saying that if you're a Terminator fan that you should definitely go and watch this movie. I would also recommend watching it in IMAX 3D because that is what I saw it in and it made it all the more EPIC. I can only hope and pray that they come out with an Unrated version of the film when it comes out officially on Blu-ray and DVD.,Terminator Genisys

The original film in the franchise is a masterpiece and it's sequel 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' is easily in my top 5 favourite films.

Terminator Genisys could have gone down either route and well.. it doesn't really go down either. It is no masterpiece and has a lot of flaws, that being said it is miles ahead of the fourth instalment and i had a blast watching this film.It is hard to describe the plot. There aren't really too many things which i could say that could count as spoilers as the trailer.. and even the poster itself.. give away a lot. It has such a lot going on that it is hard to really say. Judgement day is happening from the start, even though T2 kinda got rid of that once and for all, but despite that the beginning of the film does a good job at showing us what the future is like for John Connor and mankind. Basically, Kyle Reese, who is played by Jai Courtney who i am aware is a very wooden actor but despite this he actually wasn't all that bad in the role, is sent back to 1984 to stop the T-800 from once again killing Sarah Connor in order to ensure John Connor is never born. Pretty much the plot of the first movie right? Well there is a twist in this soft reboot. The T-800 was already sent back and has raised Sarah from childhood. The rest i will let you see for yourself because it gets a bit confusing and hard to explain without first seeing it.It was fantastic to see Arnold Schwarzenneger back in his most famous role. There is a really cool fight towards the beginning where he takes down his older self and it really is a sight to see. Emilia Clarke is a great Sarah Connor, but Linda Hamilton still remains queen of that role. I didn't really connect much with Jason Clarke's role as John Connor, he seemed more dull than Jai Courtney surprisingly, but to be honest the twist with him being a terminator himself kind of explains that one, i'm not sure how i felt about it, felt weird to see John Connor as a villain if i'm honest. Speaking of villains, the T-1000 does make an appearance in this film and i really do not know why. He sort of appears, does some cool liquid metal transformation stuff and goes away again. The effects were cool, however i honestly thought the T-1000 effects were better in Terminator 2.. and that film came out many years before this one. J.K Simmons appears also. It is kind of weird because his performance in Whiplash got him a well deserved Oscar, yet his character did nothing for this film. Also Matt Smith, recently i saw an early test screening of a film (I'm not allowed to talk about it yet) and every scene he was in i was laughing out loud. So he kind of made me do the same with this one, he played quite a pivotal role which i wont spoil, yet had around 5 minutes of screen time. Literally anyone could have played his role, but i guess he is being reserved for sequels. The time travel got a bit confusing after a while, and i cannot count how many times i saw a naked person, but when it was used well it was great. The film starts slow, but as it goes on it gets better. The third act suffers a little from what Furious 7 suffered with which is that the action sequence at the end went on a little too long and as this was happening it was making me think of all the small flaws which I'm sure you will be able to pick out yourself without me dwelling on them.Terminator Genisys does feel messy and convoluted in places, it can be confusing and sometimes the effects are ropey and don't look as good as the originals, it is no T2, but a million leagues above Salvation. Arnie is back and I'm not ashamed to say i am glad. The T-800 performance is great and very funny, but his nickname 'Pops' kind of took me out of it as it made me think of the Regular Show character. Seeing him try to fit in with humans was great and something we haven't seen too much of in this series. Not a perfect sequel, but if this were the third in a trilogy it actually probably would have been a lot cooler and a better concept. I am intrigued to see the future of the franchise considering where the story of the T- 800 left off and i can only hope Arnie will return. 'I'll be back'? Yeah, i can say i am on board with that!",Terminator Genisys

315,pootc,"Watchable, not memorable",3,7 July 2015,"Forgive me. I am a massive Terminator fan but I was one of the few which preferred Salvation (2009) over Terminator 3 (2003) because it was a serious movie which tried to take the franchise in a different direction. It wasn't a rehash or running gag like Terminator 3 and while it wasn't successful or great for that matter at least James Cameron's original material was respected, and not breezed over with a simple 'Judgment Day is inevitable line', contradicting everything which came before without any further explanation.Terminator Genisys a movie with big ideas. It respects the originals yet somehow turns them on their head and that's the hook - resetting the future and the franchise. The movie does its best to early invoke the nostalgia of the first two installments and the fight scene in 1984 between both Schwarzenegger's was a fantastic way to go and my favorite scene by far. The special effects team did an outstanding job which should be commended because the scene really had me in the mood. The timeline being flipped and the future battle scene at the beginning was a perfect introduction and it looked like we were back in James Cameron's apocalyptic future. Thins started out really promising butIt was really apparent that the casting of a clean-cut Jai Courtney for the pivotal role of Kyle Reese was a mistake. His performance and delivery was lacking on every level which hurt the experience. I really wish he'd have reached down deeper for this character and taken his cues from Michael Beihn's performance. I guess it's unfair to blame it all on him as a performer when the material and character development simply wasn't there. The character this time around did seem reduced to one-liners, and forgettable banter between the leads which was a real shame. You just can't help but compare to what came before.Michael Beihn's portrayal of Kyle Reese was classic. A battle-weary soldier sent from the future to protect the only woman he's ever loved. He was raw, gritty and emotional. That character was scarred, not just his body but his mind. He was vulnerable and we the audience felt that. Sarah Connor felt that and it's why they connected on such an emotional level. Emilia Clarke on the other hand (as Sarah Connor) was good casting. She was solid and really looks like a young Linda Hamilton which helped her case but the relationship between her and Kyle could have been fleshed out more and again pales in comparison to what came before and that's always going to be the problem here. The characters needed to be fleshed out more.No such emotion this time around and no 'great love' to speak of between the two which again, is a real shame. The first two movies strived for something deeper and more meaningful, they had a human element but it's a new day, we have a new director, writers and a new timeline. The franchise has become in essence is a parody of itself to appease the multiplex hoards, evidenced by the watered- down content the amount of kids in my showing. Schwarzenegger has the role down and no matter what he is the Terminator but I'm just not a fan of a cornball Terminator by any means. The atrocious Terminator 3 overdid it to the point I could never watch it again and that's the honest truth. I thought there was too much humor here too but in saying that without his presence to carry the new actors the movie wouldn't have held my interest as long as it did. He carries the load here. ""Old, but not obsolete"" he says. He may have a point.Unfortunately it's when the real chase begins and the big twist is revealed, and we jump decades in time the story falls apart and doesn't make a whole lot of sense when thought through to conclusion. If Sarah and Kyle don't do the deed in 1984 as in the original timeline doesn't this essentially wipe out the existence of the messiah John Connor? Without John Connor doesn't this all seem pointless? Terminator Genisys, again, a movie big on ideas and action - but little on logic and execution.For the record I liked the big twist /reveal. I thought it was a risky but rewarding move and thought it would have been a nice surprise and very impactful to the film but the bad marketing of this film ruined it for me in one of the earlier trailers and the rest was completely predictable. Nobody felt in danger here and for the end of the world the drama is just too 'lite'.While great action is the hallmark of these films so are the stakes and it became apparent once the story unfolded that it never really had anything new to offer. It's all been done before, only better.The story truly ended with Terminator 2: Judgment Day in 1991. The first two are classics and nothing can take away from them. Anything coming after is different timeline of whatnot. I have the two classics in my collection and I'll cherish them forever. Watchable but not memorable.5.5/10",Terminator Genisys
316,russellingreviews,He is back for judgement day!,7,29 June 2015,"Terminator Genisys - He's back for judgement day - 3 stars Survival. It's what you taught me! - John Conner Walking into the cinema... The original is considered a classic and T2 is iconic, but the subsequent sequels were forgettable. 22 years later, can this storyline resurrect itself or should it have remained buried? Cinematic rating: 3 stars Reel Dialogue Rating: 3 starsThe storyline for Terminator Genisys may sound familiar to those who continue to watch the first two films with nostalgic bliss. It does do a slight variation from the traditional elements and the central character of this chapter is Sgt. Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney). He was saved by John Connor (Jason Clarke) as a boy and becomes a disciple/soldier of the charismatic leader. After the supposed defeat of Skynet, he volunteers to go back to 1984 and save John's mother, Sarah Conner (Emilia Clarke) and safeguard the future. Yet, the past that is explained to him has changed. He has to come to terms with an altered future and work with Sarah and the Guardian or Pops (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Their goal is to bring down Skynet and the new Genisys operating system before judgement day and defeat an unexpected enemy that will challenge their plans and loyalties. With a reboot of a beloved franchise, staying close to the original storyline can have its advantages and disadvantages. Director Alan Taylor (The Dark World) does not veer too far from the original dystopian adventure, but takes full advantage of the time travel twists to give this version a fresh angle. All of the standard villains and allies are back with an added element that wreaks havoc on the core team and the multiple timelines. Clarke and Courtney fill the shoes of the future Conner and Reese well. They are enjoyable on screen and manage to carry the weight of the extensive dialogue and outlandish action. Taylor allows Schwarzeneggar to focus on his strengths and capitalise on the role that has come to define his career. Arnold gives his one-liners and trademark steely performance which supports the story and makes him strangely endearing. Jason Clarke was a pleasant surprise to the John Conner role. He is believable as the military leader, but his unassuming look and nature provide the depth the eventual villainous element that he represents. Director Taylor surrounds the cast with a multitude of special effects and explosions, but is reliant on the past innovations for the visual element. The effects were good, but unlike the original director James Cameron, he did not introduce anything new in this area. Taylor cannot be blamed for the cityscape, because he was left with original narrative and had to use San Francisco. But, how many times do we need to see San Francisco destroyed this year? A request to filmmakers, please move on to other cites of the world. One element that weighed things down is the multiple discourses to explain the space-time continuum. The additions to the script were necessary to make this unbelievable timeline accessible, but did slow down the momentum of the action. This is a weakness, but not enough to be labelled as a failure. The primary disappointment of this time travelling Terminator tale is that Paramount allowed the vast majority of the story to be revealed in the trailers. There were a few surprises and most of the twists were minor in comparison to what is presented in the trailer. It did not diminish the value of the film, but stole some of the potential magic. Yet, even with the lack of story twists, Terminator Genisys was enjoyable and entertaining. Like many of the nostalgic franchises that have been resurrected this year, it never takes itself too seriously, but adds enough scientific balance to make it accessible. It was a good conclusion to the story and hopefully the Conners and the Terminator will not be back. It is difficult to imagine that the dystopian world of the Terminator could provide any considerations for Biblical truth, but the meta-narrative seeps into this tale of woe. The Kyle Reese character talks about the moment when he is first introduced to John Conner. He is saved by the leader of the human uprising and says of the experience, 'For the first time, I had hope.' In amongst the special effects and time travel, a key element continues to weave through the human experience. The need for a saviour and hope. Even in the darkest of moments and the desperate times, the potential for salvation provides a light to permeate the darkness. John Conner proves to be a false leader, but thankfully God provides a leader that will not fail and provides us everlasting hope. One thing can truly be said of God's appointed saviour, he will be back. (It had to be said.)Leaving the cinema... The re-boots are beginning to overstay their welcome, but Terminator Genisys fills the need for fun entertainment. Enough nostalgia and special effects to appeal across the generations and hopefully this is the final chapter of this franchise.Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What can we know about creation? (Genesis 1-3) 2. Can we solve our own problems? (Proverbs 3:5, Philippians 4:6) 3. Why do we need a saviour?

317,Wirxaw,Will it be back?,6,3 October 2015,"Two movie trailers have made me disgusted about the movie: this and SW EVII. And the reviews have further psyched me to expect nothing but the worst.But I was pleasantly surprised.The initial, first impression, that usually can get revolting... it wasn't so bad. Unlike nonstop jokes of AoU or the utter stupidity of PromOtheus, Genisys didn't have anything groundbreaking. Anything that just makes you walk away. It did try to get away with time nonsense, but it's a reboot, what'd you expect? Every Terminator movie after the original - is a cash cow, just like Alien. The original movies presented us with a new character in movie history. After that this character just had to fight something stronger. And since the main timeline(MT) has been fulfilled, the only way to get more money - is to rewrite\reboot it and artificially create alternative timeline(AT). But more of that later. As far as impressions go, I'd like to comment on Sarah and Kyle's performances... Boy, they are horrible. But that's the generation. Last century - people needed brutal, yet kind and honest soldiers, and women who were cute and clueless, but then ended up nothing short of Xena. Now... people need dorky jocks and cute arrogant Daeneryses. Otherwise it's just not attractive. Many people have already criticized Courtney's performance as absolutely lacking any credibility, much less his face being absolutely brick. Personally, for me it has become evident after the opening narration. Even I could probably read it better, unless they just once recorded him reading these lines slowly and moved on. They should've watched Devil for the lesson of narration. Daenerys was... well, I don't watch GoT. But if they wanted the second bad***est chick after the Queen of Sci-Fi,they should've gone with Michelle Rodriguez. But I guess she wasn't as attractive as she must've been... All we get out of Daenerys is an arrogant late teen who knows it all but gets cranky about the word ""mate"". And, obviously, who can be wooed like any other Barbie. Even Pirates of the Caribbean have managed to create stronger female characters... As for the CGI and scenes - yes, all of them were rehash. But they looked well-acted and rather acceptable. For once, I could weave my suspension of disbelief and simply enjoy the show.Now the analysis, the time mumbo-jumbo:If there will be sequels - obviously it would be explained that the Skynet has twisted the timeline. ""Deleted the old one"", as the movie says. In the MT - Skynet has lost. And the Resistance has only sent Kyle AFTER that, in order to combat Skynet's ""last attempt"". Well, technically this last attempt justifies only the first movie. And... makes the following two nonexistent. Because Skynet can't send T-1000 and TX later(it's destroyed) and Resistance can't send good Arnolds to fight it - they are all(at he time machine) killed by T-5000. And if these things didn't happen - then the future is changed and they wouldn't be where they are. Whether to live with that or not - I'll leave to the fans. So theoretically - Resistance's victory in MT is real. But since Skynet is gone in MT, it's no longer relevant to it, and so Skynet has sent original T-800, Asian T-1000, as well as T-3000 itself - into the AT, right after slaughtering the resistance operators. How did it create the AT... well, that's up to the writers. The question is - who sent Pops back 9 years before all of that? My guess - the future Kyle Reese. Clearly they could make time machines from scrap, and Genisys survived, so there's still going to be some fun around. That's when Kyle did another ""continuity"" correction, and sent a pre-programmed Pops to ensure that... Terminator movies are as cliché as they can get.So yes, characters sent to AT come both from MT and AT. Because the writers can get away with it. How? Take a look at WoW: Warlords of Draenor.With all that said - the movie doesn't deserve absolute panning. It's neither the first reboot, nor the worst. It's a fancy terminatory flick, with just enough plot to make it a scientific mystery. But of course, nothing in it cries of quality. 5-6 is probably a rating for this movie, because it doesn't try hard, but it doesn't fail too hard either...",Terminator Genisys
318,the-fearless-america,Intense Nostalgic of Old Terminator,7,29 June 2015,"Terminator Genisys is a stand-alone movie, which it has more relation with terminator 2 rather than the last terminator film (terminator salvation). The storyline that director used was rather a forth-back plot. Maybe it was somekind like ""twelve monkeys"". It keep the viewers guessing and exploring the ending of the movie. Those aspect were not bad at all, it gives more thrill to the film itself. My conclusion in the storyline is good, but unfortunately not original. The director rather forcing terminator genisys to becoming like the terminator 2, he gave an intense plot packed with action, but nothing new than T2. In the other hand. Taylor using a nowadays movie formula. Giving a force drama or force sentimental scene in the middle of duration. I know people's taste nowadays like such as those formula. With force sentimental backsound, such thing like that. But it's not match for the movie itself. TG needs more than that, the storyline of the terminator franchise can be a lot more wider rather than easy predictable solution of the director and writer. I saw so many plot holes also, such as the helicopter scenes, truck scenes, etc. And the worst thing was the ending, it's like the director wants to keep arnold alive for the next franchise of terminator. If he has more courage to change those formula, i know terminator genisys will got better in critics.From all those, i should say that this movie not bad at all. It have a good strength in it. A story which the director use to grow an emotion into arnold (robot) character were fresh and new. It's like i can feel the sadness and calamity of arnold when i saw the scene in the garage (where there are pictures drawn by arnold). That scene have a big impact to viewers. With that scene, it grows the likable- feelings into arnold character, it was a huge jump into character development. From that scene also i rate this movie better (7 or maybe higher than that if i watch twice) than most people in the world did. Because it develop a connection between characters and strengthen the storyline which arnold performed. i couldn't guess further, but i think TG have a chance to becoming the future classic (20-30 years later). Because it has a basic emotional character development in it which i seldomly see. It is about caring between human and machine.",Terminator Genisys
319,jeroen-106,Awful screen writing.,1,21 August 2016,"What an incredibly lazy movie. In the first 10 minutes I already discover two major plot holes and awful clichés that I find hard to forgive. The CGI is terrible and looks so much worse than the special effects in T2. Let's just start with the first plot hole. Early on in the movie, Skynet successfully manages to send back in time a terminator as soon as it discovers it is losing. This means that Skynet is able to kill Conor without anyone to stop it. After all, once the the terminator is sent back, it should immediately affect the future (""the now"").So...1. Why didn't Skynet do this all along? Why wait with sending a robot back in time when they are about to lose? 2. The moment the robot is sent back in time, and it doesn't affect the presence, it proved to me their mission has failed anyway and humans have won. No need to send back a human as well, after all the terminator's mission didn't do anything. 3. Apparently the guy who time travels right after the terminator has to be completely naked because ""anything except organic tissue would die"". Yes, minutes ago a robot - a metal/alloy robot! - just time traveled.People would tell me I'm nitpicking and I should give the time travel paradox a break here. I disagree! This is lazy screen writing, despite the ""rules"" of time travel in this movie. I get that there are certain rules, but you have to apply them consistently and you need to come up with a story that is smart and surprising.And mind you - the above is from the first 10 minutes of watching. Next to the mediocre direction and acting I like to point out the absynal CGI. Rendering feels 90s, animation has no momentum and friction, etc. terrible, just terrible.",Terminator Genisys

You add them all into the mix of a software program (doesn't need to be as sophisticated as Skynet) and you randomly get a new script back. This is Terminator Genisys.I cannot say I mind the whole new timeline/whatever, actually I found it amusing. My problem was mostly with the dialogs, the acting and the directing. All BAD. I feel like both Emilia Clarke and Courtney are the definition of miscast. Awful. None of them has the charisma of their predecessor.

323,PeteRoy,Terminator Genisys is a parody of Terminator,5,11 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys is like watching a parody video about the Terminator franchise.The future scene was good, it was exactly like the omitted future T2 scene that they win the war and send the Terminator and Kyle back, after this scene the movie goes downhill very fast and never comes back. The movie becomes a Terminator parody film: 1. The Arnold ""Pops"" T-800 is talking too much, he gives his opinion, he has suggestions, he makes recommendations, he comment to events, giving feedback, making jokes, smiles, says stupid things, and etc. This makes him a parody of the original T-800 from T1 and T2 where the Terminator was a machine, doesn't act like a human, this what ruins the movie the most 2. Making John Connor the villain is stupid, very bad idea. 3. The actor playing Kyle Reese is awful, dreadful, and also the way he behaves, his ideas are not what you got to know from the T1 Kyle Reese. 4. Over Complicated plot is very bad idea, the Terminator 1 and 2 were complicated enough, making the plot more complicated with more timelines is bad idea, makes the movie hard to follow and understand. There are more reasons but this movie doesn't deserve too much effort anymore. I love T1 and T2, I have them on DVD, iTunes and Blu Ray, I watched them hundred of times.

You can tell when that is not the case, because it will swing more positive after the release...I think this is one of those movies, because its pretty good despite what they are saying. I heard ""it was bad, it didn't make sense, it had too much humor""...I didn't find any of that to be true. The plot was easy to follow and no more complicated then T1 and T2. The humor was no more than in the T1 or T2 (in fact maybe even less than T2). The action sequences were good, Arnold did well, I can't say I agree with the choice of Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese, I don't think he did very well with that role. Though I've seen him in some roles I did like him in. I also thought they could have done a better job with the re-imagining of the scenes from T1, I think they missed an opportunity there. Other than that its as good as the first 2. If you are a Terminator Salvation lover, which I don't think anyone is, you probably wouldn't like this movie because it totally dismisses those events.

325,prospectus_capricornium,Way Below James Cameron's Terminator,5,3 July 2015,"The newest entry to the Terminator franchise, strives with towering efforts to reclaim the glory of its two James Cameron-directed predecessors, but miserably fails to deliver even a faint hint of wit and sense, in the wake of its convoluted confusion-infested time-travel narrative.In this fifth installment, ill-wittedly conceived and called GENISYS, The Terminator is definitely back, but his legacy is dead, butchered to bits of rusty metal junks through lazy and uncreative reinvention of its original source material. The timeline is set back to 1984. Skynet sends its own terminator from 2029, to kill Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), mother of future subversive leader of the resistance, John Connor (Jason Clarke). Consequently, a human, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is also sent to stop the terminator, in humanity's desperate hope to save their species. At the time, Sarah is already being protected by her guardian terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), whose reasons of arriving in her time, is seemingly set to be never known.Time-travel has always been a fascinating subject, and it in such fashion that Terminator: Genisys, attempts to build its own stronghold in the mold of the first two films. The take assumes an interesting onset, depicting an apocalyptic future where machines lord over the human minority, but it spirals down to fatal loops of nonsensical uncreatively-staged retreads when the what can be considered the inception of human salvation (Schwarzenegger's Terminator's arrival), begins. Once the deadly cat-and-mouse chases spin out of control, confusion begins, and the film itself, can't be bothered to clear off heads as it totally busy itself to trying to awe-inspire spectators, with elaborately-constructed action setpieces, teeming with CGI-mastered explosions, pursuits, and fight scenes. There's no denying that such attempt is carried out with colossal success, but the audience would inevitably find appreciating the feat, difficult and pointless . The proceedings are sutured into recreations of some iconic scenes of the original movies, while also devising its own, at the same time. But even with all these efforts, GENISYS still fails to generate sustained interest. The result of its motives manages to hit some of the nostalgic beats of the franchise, but tepid one-liners and confusing paradoxes would drag down its capacity to last. It is also by these narrative defects that interest is being stripped off its key players, making the audience barely care about the characters and the imminence of their extinction. This is why Genisys is way below the glory of its predecessors--the dread is barely present, and fear is forced, thus ineffective.There is a screaming irony that bursts at the heels of this attempt to reinvigorate the sagging Terminator series: The Terminator (Schwarzenegger) returns to the past to save the whole of humankind, but the mess that is GENISYS, murders the franchise. 5/10",Terminator Genisys
326,parleon-thedon,"Terminator: Genisys - Review - enjoyable but, nothing memorable",5,5 July 2015,"The Actors: Arnold Schwarzenegger is back, but this time he's playing an aged T-800 (old but not obsolete). Arnie plays the role of the T-800 (CYBERNETIC ORGANISM with LIVING TISSUE OVER a METAL ENDOSKELETON) with grace and ease; The Terminator is a part Arnie was born to play (need I say more).Jason Clarke plays John Connor (the leader of The Resistance); Jason plays the role straight forward, he is neither horrible nor great.Emilia Clarke plays Sarah Connor (the mother of John Connor). Emilia has a pretty face but, I felt she lacked some of the acting capabilities required to play the role, fill the shoes, and live up to the standards of Linda Hamilton (Linda made the character of Sarah Connor such an iconic figure).Jai Courtney plays Kyle Reese (the father of John Connor/member of The Resistance/a soldier sent from the future to the past to impregnate and create John Conner). Jai Courtney is not one of my favorite actors but, I don't think he's a terrible actor. Jai played his part in this movie but, I felt he didn't deliver anything memorable.J.K. Simmons is in this movie and he's good, however, he is underutilized; I felt like his character in the movie was useless (they could easily take his character out of the movie and it wouldn't change a thing).The Action: I really enjoyed the fight sequence between the old T-800 and the young T-800. The CGI Arnold looked really good (it looked better than the young CGI Jeff Bridges in Tron: Legacy).Ultimately, I didn't care about any action scene that took place. As I was watching a action sequence unfold, I found myself feeling entertained but also bored at the same time.The action scenes move along and continue to the point where I felt that none of the real characters were in any mortal danger.The Story: Kyle Reese is sent back in time but, The future has changed. There are a lot of things sprinkled throughout the movie that die-hard fans might appreciate. There are lots of nods to T1 and T2 throughout the movie (it does feel good to watch and say, ""I remember that""). Terminator: Genisys definitely has a nostalgia factor, however, I find a lot of the scenes boring because there is nothing new put on the table.I really enjoyed the relationship between old T-800 and Sarah Conner; Arnold Schwarzenegger and Emilia Clarke had good next to almost great chemistry.The Terminator has some silly playful moments and I don't mind them. The Terminator smiles and I think it's funny. Arnold Schwarzenegger has good comic timing and delivers the funny moments with expert grace.Conclusion: Overall, Terminator: Genisys is an entertaining movie while it's being viewed but, ultimately there isn't really anything to think about after it's all over. I enjoyed the movie while watching but, after it's all said and done... I do not care. Terminator: Genisys feels like a been there and done that type of movie; nothing new is brought to the table except for a few things. However, anything that would've been close to memorable or would have changed anything was spoiled (BIG TIME!) in the trailers. Actually, (I'm sorry to say this) save your money and don't watch this movie. If you want to see the movie than just watch all of the trailers. If you watch all of the trailers than you've literally seen the whole movie.Final Grade: C",Terminator Genisys

328,roystephen-81252,Emilia Clarke Rules!,7,12 February 2016,"I liked every instalment in the Terminator series so far (some more, some less), and Genisys did not disappoint either. However, for the first 10-15 minutes of the film, I was not so sure.It starts pretty badly, with a long, boring and basically unnecessary exposition that serves no other purpose than to summarise to newbies what fans of the series already know. Then it continues with a regurgitation of scenes from the first movie, down to the last detail. I was truly appalled. Fortunately, the movie takes a 180 degrees turn from there, venturing into unexplored territories and daring (more or less) unexpected, original twists, very much in the vein of the TV show The Sarah Connor Chronicles (which I loved).Jason Clarke was slightly less a misfit for John Connor's role as I'd thought he would be (alas, the same cannot be said about Jai Courtney's Kyle Reese). Arnold was, well, adorable. J.K. Simmons's character was totally unnecessary. So, again, like in the case of Terminator: Salvation, actors and characters were basically hit or miss, with one notable exception: Emilia Clarke. I found her portrayal of Sarah Connor absolutely astounding, better than Linda Hamilton ever was in the role (I know, a blasphemy). She truly releases her inner dragon here. Just perfect. I want Emilia as Sarah Connor forever.",Terminator Genisys
329,Rat_27,Please allow this franchise to self-terminate,4,26 September 2015,"I ... really have nothing good to say about this movie. It wasn't the worst thing I've seen this year, but I don't expect to watch it again. The slight tugs of nostalgia it gave me pushed it from a 3 to a 4, but I really don't think it needs to be seen again.WTF moments:Kyle Reese was RIPPED. He is supposed to be the man-candy of the movie, obviously, and we need to find a compelling reason for Sarah Connor to fall for him. But, wasn't he supposed to be a starving refugee? As in, they were super excited to catch a rat to share for dinner starving. Dude was cut.I would have expected T-800 (1) could provide a better ambush for the T-800 (2). But, then you wouldn't get to show off Sarah Connor and the .50 cal.40mm HE weapons are not to be used indoors. This goes for both the M-203, and the Mk-19. Neither of those are CQB options.Helicopters can not do that. Pushing a helo off the side of a building means you will crash a helo in the street, right next to the building you pushed it off of.Are we sure Reese wasn't a Terminator? He got nailed by a car, and then surviving that bus crash was just crazy. The car crash was ridiculous though, because he just walked that one off.Why would you kidney punch a cyborg?Why would she threaten a T-800 with a 9mm to the head?Anyway, this could go on for quite a while, but ... that's not the point. The acting was 'meh', for the most part. There were some parts where I smiled. T-800 through the windshield was amusing, but I think that was the only part. The CGI was pretty well done, I thought some of the effects on the Connor bot were cool. The story was well below the glide path. The reboot was unnecessary, and felt like an attempt to cash in on a familiar name. I saw a worse example of this earlier this year, but I don't like seeing old characters Nerfed for today's audiences. I thought the Kyle Reese character was made prettier, but significantly weaker. ... Oh yeah, why didn't the T-1000 catch him immediately and gut him? Could he not hear him squeaking across the floor? Reese shouldn't have known anything about a T-1000, so ... how did he evade it so well?Anyway, it's clearly set up for Part 6, and probably a 7. But they should have stopped at 2.",Terminator Genisys
330,captainmike-michael,"Nothing Creative, Solely for Reboot",6,4 July 2015,"It's a great welcome to see Arnold Schwarzenegger back into real actions after so many guest appearances in other films but the main idea of the overall film leaves an impression of manipulating the time-travelling in X-Men: Days of Future Past, solely an easy way to reboot the entire franchise without a proper story line. Less darker than the other four installments, several twists are easily predicted and there is obviously a number of flaws and time paradox when the story progresses but the film is still an entertaining generic sci- fi. The scores of the film composed by Lorne Balfe are rather weak even though co-produced by Hans Zimmer, the performance of Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese is just alright, Arnold as T-800 is still the most entertaining element of the franchise with his fights and adorable robotic expressions but the pacing of the script has caused the lack of emotional engagement with Sarah Conner (Emilia Clarke). James Cameron says that this film is respectful to his first two installments back in 1984 and 1991 but action sequences are nothing new, CGIs do not improve much from previous installments and the visual effects seems a bit video game setting have overall disgraced his compliment.",Terminator Genisys

334,phoenixyk1,Don't be ashamed to like this movie...Its actually quite good,4,26 October 2015,"Before I begin my review: SPOILER ALERT!!! YES THERE WILL BE SPOILERS, I AM SORRY!I try to avoid spoilers where I can, but after watching the Movie I could only think of the script I am going to send to HISHE which will point out that Skynet has actually KILLED ITSELF!OK! So onto the review... Kyle Reese is sent back from the future to Protect Sarah Conner and her unborn son from being killed before Judgement day - But something is very wrong!That as much of a Synopsis as you need for if you have seen the Trailers the rest falls into place...The entire film takes place in a ""What If"" scenario universe much like you see in Marvel/DC Comics - As somehow an alternative 1984 has been created and the date of the Nuclear War has also changed accordingly.Its now up to Sarah, Kyle and Pops (The T-800 played by Arnie) to stop Skynet's creation again in 2017. Only to face a new enemy in their own SON, John Conner.The film manages to carry off a brisk pace without ever actually getting to confusing - and effects wise, it is fantastic! I did not watch the film in 3D - But if I had I think it would have worked out OK... Sadly, there is a little too much emphasis again on having things fly at the screen to try and get reaction for 3D viewers - The same lame tactic that was pulled in the 1980's with films like ""Freddie's Dead: A Nightmare on Elm Street 6"".When are the movie studios going to get this right? We know you can do 3D - You do NOT have to shove it in our faces to get a reaction!!! Follow Pixar's example and use it to add depth... It looks better and helps keep the suspension of disbelief longer (I do not know if anyone else has this issue... But I find after 30 minutes in a Movie Theatre, including the 3D trailers... I stop noticing the 3D effect at all)Action scenes are excellent, but the re-renders of the scenes from the original film are not so good... Just don't expect a scientific marvel - The film has absolutely no sense of its own story and has some REALLY SERIOUS PLOT HOLES!!! And I mean really Serious!Like Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner first meeting and not getting together in 1984 which means John Conner cannot exist... Yet he manages to come back from the future to try and attack them?Bit of a Bill and Ted paradigm here as Skynet Needs John Conner to create Itself - And Kyle and Sarah KNOW that fact... What happens if Sarah or Kyle get the chop and do not have Children???Yup! Like I said, Skynet in fact kills itself in this movie... If I were to go into every single plot hole I could rip the film to pieces... But I am not so cruel as to do that.Serious plot issues aside, Effects are brilliant - The film is good and the action is well worth watching...Its not going to be anywhere near as good as T2 ever... But its not as bad as many critics make out.Go in expecting a great action movie and you are going to be in Heaven. If you are hoping for a ""Proper"" Terminator film to relaunch the franchise - Its then that you will be disappointed.Great film if you ignore its origins and treat it as what it is - A Stand Alone.",Terminator Genisys

336,SteveResin,Terminator Genisys: Terminator's Greatest Hits,6,27 September 2015,"First off I'm not a Terminator fanboy, I've never considered any of the movies close to becoming a classic, but I enjoyed them for the most part even as they deteriorated in quality with each subsequent release.The 1984 original had a fantastic story but was let down considerably by the cheap and nasty sfx. Conversely T2 lacked a decent story but made up for it with (for it's time) state of the art sfx. T3 was decent and had my favorite John Connor of the franchise but lacked focus and had way too many gags. T4 went A-list with Bale and Worthington but again lacked a decent and captivating story and fell short.So I wasn't expecting a classic when I finally saw Genisys, but I still expected something a little more engaging than this mess. If truth be told, they're blatantly running out of ideas and just decided to throw previous story lines into one big apocalyptic stew. We get young Arnie, old Arnie, we go back to 1984, we get the T-1000, we get Sarah Connor in the 80s and also in future time, the romance between Sarah and Kyle, we get John in the future fighting Skynet, we get Kyle going back to 1984 again, and all these things mixed together with little nods and winks to the original audiences that have followed the franchise over the years. And it's a mess.I rated it 6 because it's not essentially an awful movie, the set pieces are very well done, there's lots of action and the cast are adequate, but as far as it being a Terminator movie it feels like it's going nowhere fast and just retreading old ground. There's a lot of bad here. Whoever thought it was a good idea to have Sarah Connor constantly refer to Arnie as ""Pops"" needs to choose another career, because that was making me cringe, along with Arnie's ""cheesy grin"" gags that popped up a few times.This franchise has completely run out of steam and when the ""bad"" movies outnumber the ""good"" in a series it's time to terminate.",Terminator Genisys

However, while inside the Time Displacement Equipment, John Connor has been compromised. Unsure of what happen in the future or will happen after reaching his destination.Reese arrived on May 12, 1984 - but his memories is shattered with two alternate time-lines.

The entire franchise has been reset after John Connor has been infected by T-5000 Genisys in the future, whom seem to have a real body and blend as TechCom resistance army. The John Connor whom Reese once know is no longer there, only fraction of his memories and voice surfaces. His entire life is unreal.There are some clichés scenes to make tribute to James Cameron The Terminator; when a Terminator arrives in 1984 to find clothes from the thug. The T-1000 arrival and more.

338,gianlucamarzano16,"an enjoyable action movie, go in with an open mind",7,2 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys is directed by Alan Taylor and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Clarke, Emilia Clarke, and Jai Courtney. When the first trailer came out I was thinking it could be an okay movie, the more trailers were coming out, the more the movie seem to be bad. But after seeing it, I was surprised that I enjoyed the movie a lot. While the movie has lots of problems with the time line and acting, it is still a fun movie to watch. First the acting, it's okay. Arnold Schwarzenegger back as the T-800 is amazing, Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor was very good. People said she was a miscast but I didn't see that at all. Now the person who was miscast was Jai Courtney, it wasn't that he was bad but he wasn't great either. You could see some one else playing the role of Kyle Reese a lot better. Jason Clarke Also played a good John Connor. The action was over the top but still enjoyable. The biggest problem with Terminator Genisys was the time line. They try to fill in things,try to change other things, add new things but the result was very confusing. Overall Terminator Genisys was a very enjoyable action movie but it does change and add new things to the terminator series.",Terminator Genisys
339,lhunt-9,Terminator Genisys is an entirely worthy entry to the series... it succeeds!,7,17 July 2015,"OK. It seems there have been some critical reviews of Terminator Genisys​. Well, if you liked the other ones, then you'll like this one just fine. They didn't do anything wrong. Of course T100s can age, they have human skin. Then there are the polymetal terminators and the new human/terminator hybrids. Confused? Aw, it's not that confusing. Skynet is still bad and has to be stopped. It keeps coming up with new kinds of Terminators to fight humans in multiple timelines (thus, sequels can keep being made). Arnold is still fine as a Terminator, with marginal but significant emotions and awkward smiles, Jai Courtney excels as Kyle Reese, and Emilia Clarke is perfectly capable as Sarah Connor. John Connor is a more complex character this time, and that part may have to get fixed in the next one. Hopefully there will be another one. I'm sure Skynet has more tricks up its digital sleeve. No worries. Watch it if you're interested. (I for one don't need to see anywhere near so many things crashing and blowing up, but I guess there are those who do... they won't be disappointed. But there is a plot and quite a few things to think about as well.)",Terminator Genisys
340,watchtiger1,Convoluted Mess.....Wait for DVD.....Save your $$$ for Star Wars 7,1,12 July 2015,"Take ALL of the previous Terminator movies, add the ""Q"" concept from Star Trek The Next Generation, as well as a bit of Doctor Who and you get the convoluted mess of Terminator Genisys.First of all credits are overly long you get two styles. Then there is the ""John Connor"" monologue. This is way too much and way too long.You travel back to 1984, then go forward to 1997 and if you blink, grab some popcorn, or sip your soda you will miss the time travel forward to 2017.Now, there is four terminators in the movie two T-800 (current aged Arnold & a 1984 CGI Arnold). The young CGI T-800 1984 Arnold is dispatched quickly. Then you have a T-1000 (liquid metal) that also eliminated fairly fast. Later you get more time travel by another T-1000 which is John Connor and shifts to other forms as well.Then add in the meeting of the young boy Kyle Reese and his parents at the police station escape. WHY we don't need to see this. They are there because there is a crazy cop that remembers ALL of this from 1984 and has been searching for it since then when he was a 25 year old rookie, the script can't even get the time right he first says 30 years ago then 35 years ago. If we go with the later he is now 60 years old, many states have a mandatory retirement age of 60 for police personnel so he wouldn't be there, also they KNEW he's been looking for the Terminator since 1984, he would have been label crazy and released from the police force.There is so much time travel in this movie you really never know where you are.My over all opinion of this movie is this: Take all the previous Terminator movies, add elements of Star Trek: The Next Generation, also add Doctor Who. Put that all in a shake n bake bag, shake it and then toss contents on a table anything face up is what gets used.That gives you a week script, one expensive actor, the rest barely known so you get bad acting as well.Wait for DVD save your money to see Star Wars VII.",Terminator Genisys
341,btkb,My Opinion to the Terminator series! All in One!,9,20 March 2020,"Saying each of the movie series here rather than one by one! Hope it helps!Terminator - It was GREAT! I did not expect the Terminator to be the villain here, but it was great seeing Kyle Reese from the future fighting and saving Sarah Connor.Terminator 2 - Terminator as the hero, and funny when being taught by John Connor on how to smile, and saying ""Hasta la vista, baby!"" It was great! The ending was sad, but it was overall, great!Terminator 3 - The fight between T-X and Terminator was great! Surprised how the Terminator has to keep coming to the past to help John Connor and his family.Terminator Salvation - It was different! It was okay, but not compared to the first to the third movies. It showed Schwarzenegger in a CGI form as a Terminator fighting with Marcus Wright and John Connor. It was pretty good though. It's still worth watching!Terminator Genisys - Surprisingly, good! You see young Sarah helping with the Terminator, along with young Kyle Reese. Of course, there was a twist to it. John Connor, or T-3000, is the villain in this, which is shocking! Definitely worth the watch! It looks great!",Terminator Genisys
342,AliceofX,Basically Bad Fan-Fiction,4,21 July 2015,"Review title pretty much says it all.If you can't do an action film with a good story at least have one that doesn't get in the way of the action. Terminator: Genisys does the cardinal sin here. Instead of being merely forgettable the story actually makes you stop and think - wait, this makes no sense. So you can't even enjoy it as a dumb popcorn flick.There were some genuinely funny bits in this film, but as I write this merely a day after having seen Terminator: Genisys there is nothing memorable that sticks to my mind. With a 26% score on Rotten Tomatoes I expected it would have at least something in the film to hate and rant about it but the film is entirely forgettable. Other reviewers have remarked that Arnold Schwarzenegger was the best part of the movie and I would have to agree with that opinion. Here he was a lot more interesting than in Terminator 3 and if you are a fan of that character you might be interested in seeing this film. But for fans of the Terminator series I would not recommend this film. Especially if you, like me, loved the second film.",Terminator Genisys
343,eckhouse24,Fun and Enjoyable Watch!,10,11 July 2015,"Went in this hearing all the buzz about it not being so good and to be honest, I thought it was better then good. I had a fun time watching this movie, maybe because it brought me back to what was SO good about the first two in the series.T3 was just one long action ride chase scene that for it's mistakes, made up with the final three minutes. SALVATION could have been better but it always felt like it was missing 30-45 minutes of footage and Arnold!GENISYS beings the series back to storytelling. I am sure there will be people who hate the alternate timeline, but I think it makes it interesting. I loved how the opening scenes were almost carbon copies of the FIRST TERMINATOR. I thought ARNOLD looked pretty good and acted well. The action scenes were top notch and there was a lot of paid tribute to all the films and the series in this film which was nice, even the brief cameo by Robert Patrick was great.I have two negatives....the relationship between Kyle Reese and Sara seemed forced and unnatural and John Connor seemed miscast. Overall, I would recommend this movie and remember to check your brain at the door when you walk into the theatre....there should not be much thought going into this movie, you should be watching it for the ride....I mean seriously, if this is much better then a FURIOUS 7!",Terminator Genisys
344,DaRick89,"Has many faults, but is nonetheless watchable and admirably ambitious",6,24 November 2018,"Terminator: Genisys is admirably ambitious in how it attempts to play with the mythology of the first two classic films by altering and combining crucial plot details within the first two Terminator films while extending upon them by having the heroes travel forward, rather than backwards, in time. I also felt that Terminator: Genisys was truer to the underlying premise of said films than the third or fourth: that there is no set fate. This may have been why James Cameron was more enthusiastic about this film than he was Terminator 3, which outright obviated that premise. However, incorporating and combining plot elements from the first two films will inevitably invite comparisons to them and regrettably Terminator: Genisys is a far worse film than either.The first problem is with the plot, despite having some interesting twists and variations on existing themes (such as the T-800 protecting rather than trying to murder Sarah Connor). The plot in the first two Terminator films was free of any plot holes. Unfortunately, the same is not true here. In this film, both the T-1000 and T-800 demonstrate capabilities that should have been beyond these models (being able to repair disabled Terminators, for example). Kyle Reese and John Connor both seem remarkably healthy, both physically and psychologically, given the inevitable trauma associated with losing family members and fighting an apocalyptic war. Plus one billion people pre-ordering an app is hard to accept.Additionally, the plot squanders many potentially interesting devices. For instance, the T-1000 is underused and the T-5000 is barely seen. The concept of the entire Connor family fighting Skynet, or even teaching it that annihilating humanity is wrong while it is in its more suggestible child-like state, is intriguing, but is never explored. Even the idea of the villain fighting his brainwashing would have made his potential death even more poignant given his relationship with the protagonists. The differences between 1984 and 2017 are also not remarked upon as much as one would expect from two people who have just travelled forwards in time. Also, the moral hazard associated with killing a blameless child-like creature is not reflected upon by the heroes.The direction is generally acceptable, with the viewer being able to clearly understand what is happening, but the CGI effects do not work quite as well as they did in Terminator 2. Some, like the T-3000, were indeed quite impressive but other scenes overused CGI, such as the helicopter chase, thus detracting from its believability.The dialogue tries to pay homage to the first two films by reusing lines, but it is also marred by some inconsistencies. John, if you are more than a mere machine, how can you say that the machines will rule the world? Are you saying that you will not rule the world on account of you not being quite a machine?The acting is a mixed bag. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a welcome addition. He is clearly no longer in his physical prime but he nonetheless adds some much needed levity to a serious film. Jai Courtney on the other hand is not great. He is physically impressive but that detracts from his credibility in the role given the travails his character endured would likely affect his physical health. Additionally, while he has some of Michael Biehn's intensity, he doesn't bring any of Biehn's humanity to the role. He simply doesn't behave like a normal human being and so lacks chemistry with the one-dimensional Clarke, who plays a generic 'strong woman'. Jason Clarke is a bit better, transitioning reasonably effectively from an affable hero into a menacing villain, but again his character seemed a little too well adjusted given what he endured. Matt Smith and Lee Byung-hun are underused, but both are purposeful and menacing in their roles. JK Simmons is just a novelty.In the end, while I've been critical of this film, I will say that I actually enjoyed watching it despite its many faults, not least because the pacing was quite good, with action scenes intelligently being placed throughout the film. Normally I would give a film this flawed a bare passing grade on the grounds that it is at least watchable, but I admire this film's ambition in playing with the first two classic films (with some success), even though it doesn't fulfil its boundless potential. Hence, I award:3/5 stars",Terminator Genisys

However for Hollywood it seems the future is to reboot 'or pay homage' to the original by reworking, re-imagining or just updating what the viewer has already seen.Terminator Genisys isn't much different – it tries to be clever with this new incarnation by reworking some of the original elements to work within the films new time-line; this is interesting for a while – and will probably go down well with fans – but then it carries on throughout the rest of the movie turning it into a Terminator Easter Egg Hunt which gets boring pretty quick.The remainder of the movie is the usual take down Skynet before it takes over mixed in with the same time travel paradoxes and another type of adaptable Terminator (made from iron filings) to mix in with the classic T-800 and the T-1000. Given how much of a Hash/Mash Up this film is, its surprising that they didn't throw in the T-X just for the sake of it to complete this soup of a movie.With regard to the casting the Aged Old Arnie kinda works and Emilia Clarke was a good choice for Sarah. Jai Courtney lets the side down playing the same one liner oaf he seems to play in all of the films he is in.It is watchable (and instantly forgettable) but at best all it seems to manage with its homage and re-telling is make the viewer realise how good the first two movies were and how trying to recreate it (literally) will never result in another decent Terminator movie.",Terminator Genisys
347,jpkwolf,Old.. but not obsolete,7,31 July 2015,"What is best about this new entry in the Terminator franchise? The script is good and the action set pieces are sometimes better than anything in Salvation or T-3. The two terminators do a good enough job. As does Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor. Jai Courtney is miscast as Kyle Reese but still tries his best. Arnold is funny and on point as the old T-800 unit.Somehow it never reaches the level of The Terminator or especially Terminator 2. It's not as brutal or scary and just feels too safe. Thank you PG-13 rating. However it's still a good sequel in the franchise. Just several minor issues try to drag it down like Sarah calling the T-800 Arnold ""Pops"" which is honestly quite cringe worthy. There's also some possible plot holes but if you don't think about it too much you'll enjoy the heck out of this movie. Also the CGI and visual effects sometimes leave a lot to be desired. The 3D was surprisingly enjoyable though.Would I recommend for you to see it? Yes. Is it a perfect and worthy sequel to Terminator 2? No.. but it's still the best sequel we have got since that film. Also the less you know about the story, the better.",Terminator Genisys
348,Gin-ster,Confusing mess,5,29 August 2016,"I will start with a ""disclaimer"" - I am perfectly willing to suspend disbelief for a good story, and will accept the idea that artificial beings in various forms can exist, and that time travel is possible. So the ludicrousness of the film's basic setting is not the problem. The problem is that it is a confusing mess; time travel is ""part of the deal"" with Terminator films, but in this case there seem to be a multitude of time lines which are never explained so questions keep arising such as *SPOILER* if Connor is a bad guy and Kyle and Sarah know it, why will they nevertheless ""procreate to produce, well, Connor? Why did Connor send Kyle back, then Connor himself showed up to proclaim that allowing Skynet to come online was his #1 goal? (Why not just keep Kyle in the wrecked future?) I ""get"" the whole concept of the fragmented timeline, in which something changed in the past changes the future - as in a number of fine sci fi films and/or TV like Butterfly Effect, Back to the Future, 12 Monkeys and several Star Trek episodes. But even though you have to pay attention to time-travel story lines, it doesn't have to be so utterly confusing. The confusion resulted in never knowing what the heck was going on and that made for dull viewing. As others have mentioned, the special effects are great, and there is a great deal of ""homage"" to earlier Terminator films, but that being the case, I recommend renting these instead.:)",Terminator Genisys
349,dayton-w-price,Wow just wow!.,4,6 March 2020,"I mean, why couldn't the whole movie be about the first 10 minutes, that would have made for and excellent film. Oh here a good movie idea let's combine the first two movie's together including the T-800 scene in the first movie and the punks, and then have Kyle Reese show up and run into a cop, but have that cop be the T-1000 from the second movie. The plot holes in this film are plentiful, and some of the special effects are shoddy, especially with the T-800 in the beginning, I'm mean wow...the idea of the the infiltrators looking human, is to look human and not like an empty shell. And the worst part is turning the hero of the franchise into a terminator, that would be cool right? wrong, and then have it altered the timeline, so we can do more idiotic ideas. I will say the reason why this movie gets a 4 from me, is because I really loved seeing Arnold as the T-800 again in the good role. But obviously it wasn't enough too save this stupid and worthless remake or whatever it is. Just a rinse and repeat, apparently it's too difficult to come up with original material, so maybe this should be a good time to stop making Terminator movies, I mean look what happen with Dark Fate, just drive the stake in farther, you've already killed the franchise just stop no more.",Terminator Genisys

351,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,A step back for the franchise,6,14 July 2018,"Terminator Genisys (2015) ReviewIt gets off to a promising start with an entertaining future war battle and a confrontation between a liquid metal terminator. There is also a fun fight where Arnold fights his younger self. However by the time the second act kicks in the film becomes convoluted and starts to fall apart becoming a parody of itself. They re-filmed some of the stuff from the 1984 film like the shooting locations which look spot on and a really convincing CG recreation of a young Arnold. But the punks who get their clothes stolen look nothing like the ones from the first film. Put those two scenes side by side and you can tell instantly from their clothing and hairstyles that they look nothing alike, they just look like bad cosplayers. Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese was a poor casting choice as he bares little resemblance to the previous actor who played him and his acting is also very wooden. Emilia Clarke is great as Sarah Connor and she does look like Linda Hamilton from the 80's but towards the end she just becomes a little bit annoying. Arnold Schwarzenegger looks to be enjoying himself here but being in his late sixties he really needs to consider quitting. Yes they explain that cyborg skin ages like humans (which is a stretch even for these films) but it's just an excuse to keep him in the role for years to come. ""Old, not obsolete"" is his new catchphrase. The villain is quite interesting as its non other than John Connor merged with a cyborg (thank the trailers for ruining that twist). His abilities look visually stunning but he's wasted as he doesn't show up until the third act. There are too many plot threads going on throughout and the film loses it focus. There is some fun to be had and the action sequences are enjoyable but they don't really serve a purpose, they are just there for the sake of it. They tried to do something different with it but it just isn't enough for it to work as a Terminator film. Clearly a victim of studio meddling, it's just another needless sequel to the franchise which has run its course. They are currently shooting a reboot which ignores the events of the last three movies. Third times the charm. Let's hope they don't mess this one up.",Terminator Genisys
352,Larsii90,I don't get the rating or the hate,8,23 August 2021,"I just started watching all Terminator movies in order for the first time, and to get one thing out of the way - despite them being a little outdated for a first time watch today, I completely understand why Terminator and Terminator 2 will never be beat. They were great for their respective time, and I really did love Terminator 2.I also liked Terminator 3. Despite it not holding up to the same quality level, it was still a great time with tons of action. I found Terminator Salvation to be a fine enough stand alone action/sci-fi, but it didn't feel like a Terminator movie for me at all.BUT this movie sent it all back to me. I thought it was slightly better than Terminator 3 and I loved having Arnold back. I also think Clarke and Courtney did a good job with their roles as Sarah Connor and Kyle. Overall I was very entertained and I thought it had lots of good action and some funny comedy.I have never been a huge Terminator fan, so maybe that's why I don't hate this sequel like so many others, but I liked this and I probably will like the next one too.",Terminator Genisys

354,haosstoposto,Terminator for children,3,11 August 2015,"Funny and illogical movie I didn't have any expectations for this movie because it is not a good sign when the main plot-point is already shown in the trailer. I speak of John Connors enslavement by Skynet. The trailer has shown everything that might have been surprising in the movie. But nevertheless there are bigger problems with this Terminator. First of all - the cast. I was disappointed when I saw that Kyle Reese was played by Jai Courtney. He looks like a supermodel which is unexpected to see in the bleak-postapocaliptic future. Michael Biehn from the original movie was far better choice – hunted and haunted soldier who finds himself against difficult odds. John Connor was played by Jason Clarke, an actor who lacks the charisma for this character. And Sarah Connor was played by beautiful Emilia Clarke which is also an unusual choice because she is supposed to be be tough as nails but she never manages to looks dangerous. As for the movie - the story itself is chaotic and convoluted and looses itself in time-travel paradoxes. I will not try to explain what exactly happened, because to be honest, I have no idea. There were always some serious plot holes about the terminator time travel, and in my opinion only the original movie managed to avoid entanglement in paradoxes. That movie remained linear, logical and hopeless which brings me to our main plot point which I would like to elaborate. We know that time travel was last ace in the hole for Skynet after its defeat by human resistance. We have a superior AI with planetary resources and it managed to build a time travel device. But how is it possible that Skynet didn't know that every tampering with the past can only create a timeline in which it already exists. There can be no change, the fate is set. It was always unavoidable for terminator to go back in time, to be followed by a single resistance member and both of them to meet their end in the past. The only logical explanation is that Skynet didn't try to alter the past but to ensure its existence. In T2 we see that Skynet was a product from the leftovers of the terminator from the future. As for the robots – it was unusual to see T1000 model in the T2 movie. I always thought that the terminator from part one was one last shot for Skynet, the most advanced killing-machine in its arsenal. But then we have a new liquid-metal model. If that things was operational before the resistance stormed the Skynet time machine complex, why didn't Skynet use this model to kill Sarah before her son was born. Ofcouse, because the creator of Terminator, James Cameron didn't plan to expand his story from the original movie. T1000 came later and it was not possible to integrate it in the story without flaws. And I always thought that terminators are self-sufficient programmed units without the need to receive informations during the battle. Time-travel of model T800 from the original movie and T1000 from T2 support this theory. But in this new installement, they have used a Federation-Army approach from Star Wars-The Phantom Menace. When the resistance destroyed the Skynet, all it's terminators went offline, which saved our main characters, by the way, which I found pretty stupid. Also we see T1000 repairs a destroyed T800 with a blob of its liquid-metal. But in T2 it was explained that T1000 cannot form complex devices. An we also see in the end an amalgamation between our terminator hero and some T1000 liquid metal prototypes. In this movie, we have to deal with alternate realities as a result of time-travel which are a convenient plot-device for future installements of the franchise. We see T800 go back into the past. And we don't see T1000 travel, so I have no idea from where it came. From a different timeline? Maybe. T1000 encounters Kyle and it is clear that it awaited him, but how in the world this machine knew when Kyle will arrive is not explained. We then see T800 arrive, ready to kill some punkers and there is our Terminator Hero (Sarah calls him Paps) who was sent to protect Sarah Connor since her childhood. By who, I have no idea. Paps tries to kill T800 and fails, which is no big surprise because he was armed only with 12-gauge shotgun which is not enough to kill a terminator. I wonder how Paps didn't know that this weapon is too weak. He should know what kind od weapon can kill him. He is rescued by Sarah who stops T800 with a large-caliber sniper rifle. Why she didn't kill T800 this way in the first place is not clear. Then we have a showdown with T1000 and our heroes get rid of him easily with the help of acid-trap. We then see that Sarah and Paps have built a time-machine and they only needed a terminators head to make this thing work. How did they manage to build such a device is beyond me. Our heroes then travel to 2017 to try and stop Skynet to go online as a new internet-device called Genisys. There they meet John Connor who has been turned into a terminator T3000 (I hate so many terminators, each and every one more powerful then his predecessor), who is almost unstoppable,because he consists of nano-devices on molecular level, but I don't see why he should be impervious to acid. Our heroes survive, bad guy is destroyed (actually not, because during the end credits we see that some version of Genisys has survived). In my opinion this movie look like it was written by some children-fanboys who tried to cram some cool ideas in the movie and failed to follow the tone of its predecessors, but they only achieved to erase from history Terminator 1 and 2, the best parts of the franchise.",Terminator Genisys
355,bartonj2410,"Sorry Arnie, but this is both old AND obsolete",3,5 July 2015,"""You're nothing but a relic from a deleted timeline.""This was the exact moment I felt like standing up, letting out an angry scream and then walking out of the cinema. I didn't though and forced myself to stay until the end of Terminator: Genisys, the fifth film in the once popular but now very tired franchise.Genisys is the first film of the franchise that strays away from the original story by introducing an alternate timeline. The writers may have thought it sounded clever on paper but unfortunately it's a total mess from start to finish.In 2029, John Connor (Jason Clarke) sends trusted soldier Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to 1984 Los Angeles in order to protect his mother, Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), from a terminator sent back by Skynet to kill her.When Reese arrives in 1984 though, he finds that things have changed and are not as they're supposed to be; a T-1000 (Lee Byung-hun) has been sent to intercept him and Sarah Connor is not the clueless damsel in distress. Instead she is aware of everything that is set to happen because she has been raised by a T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who was sent to protect her from a Skynet attack back in 1973.The rules change yet again when Sarah and Reese travel forward to 2017 San Francisco to stop the launch of Genisys, an operating system that links every electronic device to one another, making the downfall of humanity an easier task for Skynet. They are joined in 2017 by John, who is now a T-3000 nano-machine hybrid after being attacked by Skynet during Reese's transportation back to 1984. He has two options for Sarah and Reese; join him and the machines or die.Now, I'm a huge fan of both The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, two excellent sci-fi films that are the clear pinnacles of the franchise. It disappoints me massively then that James Cameron, who directed both of those two, gives Genisys his backing as the true third Terminator film. Yes, there are iconic moments from both films reimagined, the most entertaining being an Arnold vs Arnold fight, but it doesn't last very long. That's what ended up being the film's major problem; the good moments are rare and do not last very long, at all.To put it bluntly, the film is just very badly made. Alan Taylor is the director this time round and he finds himself well and truly out of his depth with Genisys. He seems to lack the storytelling ability that made the first two films connect so well with their audience and his film is supported by a moronic screenplay from Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier.The alternate timeline that Genisys introduces just feels like such a let down and for me, quite an insult to the legacy of the first two films. I'm all for going in a new direction but not when it is done so shoddily. Another of the film's many problems is the big twist that was rather stupidly revealed in the trailer. John Connor being a terminator should have had people gasping in the audience however, when you show that in the trailer, you take away any impact it could have made. I'm not even fully on board with the idea as it was just written so badly but come on guys, leave some things under wraps until we actually see the film.I can't really fault the film for its special effects, especially the digitally created Schwarzenegger from 1984, it's just a shame that the rest of the film is not up to scratch.I know he is busy with Avatar sequels, but it remains the same since Judgement Day that James Cameron is the only man that can make a good Terminator film.Then come the performances, which are generally bad all round. Arnold Schwarzenegger has never had great acting ability and he tries his best again here however, due to the terrible script, his once iconic role is treated like a walking joke, spouting lame pun after lame pun while awkwardly discussing Sarah and Reese's need to mate.Emilia Clarke, best known as Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones, gives it a good go in the role of Sarah Connor but she is no Linda Hamilton. In fact, once again due to the bad writing, she comes across as more of a parody of the character. Jason Clarke hams it up as John Connor while J. K. Simmons wastes his talent with a minor role that tries to get some cheap laughs.The worst though has to be Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese. The man just can't act well at all. He is nowhere near as bad as he was in A Good Day to Die Hard but that is a whole new level of bad. He has no charisma and makes Michael Biehn's performance in the role look like Daniel Day-Lewis. He best not ruin Suicide Squad for me.Even the terminators of the film get treated poorly by the writers. These are machines that stalked their targets in such a menacing and eerie manner in the first two films. Now, the T-1000 is there just to show that he can be shot and carry on while John Connor as the villain feels all too underwhelming.It seems as if the studio can't be bargained or reasoned with. They certainly don't show any remorse and I don't think they will ever stop, ever, until this franchise is dead in the ground. Sorry Arnie, but this is both old AND obsolete.",Terminator Genisys
356,Zulfmanauthor,Terminator Reloaded!,7,12 July 2015,"The great 'Terminator' series which began in 1984 with a revolutionary concept of the machines taking over and waging war against mankind, has become stale due to lesser sequels. The first two movies were great for different reasons, the original movie was a bleak and terrifying vision of the future whereas the sequel was an action packed multi-million dollar extravaganza which broke box office records. However the following two instalments did not fit into the bigger picture and failed to capture the imagination. Now we have 'Genisys' a movie which has been backed by great action sequences and a brand new look at the entire story. Not to mention the fact that Schwarznegger is back and in great form as the futuristic protector. This film is a re-boot as well as a prequel to the original two instalments but at times this film seems like it is simply paying homage to James Cameron's masterpiece. In truth, this fifth instalment adds nothing new but it reminds us of what made Terminator such a great film without ever re-creating the same brilliance as the 1984 and 1991 versions. But this is a new age and much thought has gone into this re-telling of the Terminator story with more expansion of how 'Skynet' actually took over the world. This concept was novel decades ago but with the development of technology, 'Genisys' is now able to shed light on how it actually happened. The only question is whether there is any need to have a new series, we know there are more movies to come but the fear is that this new series will lose it's way and only repeat much of what has already been done before.",Terminator Genisys

After this one is expected to be more two movies. Some questions are left without being answered in it, that's fine, due to the fact as said before more films will come. The problem instead is how this new trilogy is created, the way they told was very confusing, some parts having no sense, then the origin of the movie is very poorly explained. The CGI used was very good. Especially, when there's the fight between the old T-800 and the new, the new seemed so real and looked so much with the one in the first film of the franchise. If possible, you should definitely watch T1 and T2 before to have a fresh memory, because Terminator Genisys gives some Easter- eggs and some answers to certain small details from The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The action scenes aren't bad but aren't spectacular either, those which your heart starts to beat faster, end up pretty fast.The selection casting may be considered somewhat doubtful, for the presence of either horrible and satisfactory performances. Emilia Clarke delivered a convincing acting, the doubts and uncertainties, as the tough side, are well-developed along the film. Undoubtedly the best part is Arnold Schwarzenegger for many reasons. The charisma he brings with the character and to the movie is incredible, also he's the comic relief in this one and some of his lines and gestures are really funny. Another interesting aspect of this T-800 is the retake in creating a bond with a human, Sarah Connor, just like it's done in T2 with John Connor, showing in some moments glimpses of emotions in the terminator, even he being a machine.Jason Clarke as John Connor takes in a very different path from the others movies, although the execution is good and solid, it isn't remarkable and could be better. Kyle Resse is played by Jai Courtney, he has the worst performance, it seems like he didn't commit very much to the picture, because he shows no emotion. His facial expression almost doesn't change in the entire movie. The lack of dedication to present a memorable character is really frustrating.",Terminator Genisys

Not the film that will do well in America has they have gotten used to the cringe worthy Liam Neeson and forget the Charisma of the great Arnold Schwarzenegger. If it wasn't for him there would be no T2 OR T3. Cameron only got 100 million for T2 because of Arnold's Huge popularity and ties with Carolco, if not for him you wouldn't even be such a terminator fan so those saying a Terminator is not a terminator without Cameron are simply Cameron boys. Well TG is a 10 out of 10 and deserves more then the bad cred it is receiving. If you want a full on action thrill ride then this film is for you.

Combine that with granpa Arnie nursemaiding the heroes through their crises and it all feels a bit silly and plodding.
The supposedly nail-biting, will-they-make-it moments are rather predictable. Both the John Connor and Kyle Reese characters are completely unconvincing. John Connor bears little relation to his character in the previous films and Kyle Reese is just bland. Apart from the VFX, the only thing that just about raises the film into the entertaining category is Emelia Clarke outshining the rest of the cast as a thoroughly believable Sarah Connor, along with a couple of comic moments by Arnie.

361,Celluloid_Fiend,Time After Time... With Human Killing Machines!,7,9 January 2019,"When a franchise is reaching for it's fifth entry in the series, you usually expect it to be sucked dry of any interesting twists or dimensions. Terminator Genisys avoids that, by using the time travel aspect and mixing things up from how we all know the well-worn plot to go. It makes for some fun and entertaining movie magic, for a property we all thought had no juice left in it.Things all start as we know it before, with John Connor sending Kyle Reese (his father, who doesn't know he's his father yet) back in time to save his mother. But when Skynet jumps the gun and alters things at the moment of Kyle's time trip, what we thought we knew is no longer so. Kyle lands in the past to save Sarah Connor, only to learn that she doesn't need his saving and that everything has changed. They soon travel into the future to put an end to Skynet for good, only to find that Skynet's newest assassin is the last person they would expect! Will they be able to overcome someone they trusted and stop Skynet, or does this spell the final doom for all humanity?It was a lot of fun with the twists made in time, as you got to see scene that were familiar, yet also changed and different. It added a level of excitement, as you weren't sure what was going to happen next, much like in the first film. Arnold is back in the role that made him a superstar, although he didn't do as much of the physical stuff as in times past. It was nice to see him go up against himself in his prime, though. Emilia Clarke was great as Sarah, even managing to give some looks and reactions that straight up reminded me of Linda Hamilton. But this Sarah isn't as hard as Hamilton's became and is much more brooding in the fact she feels little control over her fate. A nice change from the Sarah we knew. Jason Clarke was adequate as John Connor. If nothing else he washed the bad taste out of my mouth that Christian Bale left with his turn as the character in Terminator Salvation (for which I am ever so thankful). Lastly, Jai Courtney had the unenviable task of filling the role Michael Biehn made a staple of the series. He does his best, but he lacked the cool intensity that Kyle Reese had. Of all the characters, his was the one that should have had the least amount of change, which only makes an unenviable task of playing him all the more difficult.Overall the performances are fine. While certainly not as great as some past outings, they hold their own against characters that have become icons to us. The action sequences are pretty good (if a bit subdued, mostly due to Arnold's age) and there are some nice twists on themes throughout the proceedings, as we watch everything that we know was changed come to fruition. If I had any real qualms, it was at the end with the footage during the credits. I know the desire to keep the franchise going is strong, but I'd rather this be the end and let it go out on a good note, rather than run it into the ground with more sequels.Terminator Genisys doesn't reinvent the wheel, so much as it contorts it so you don't realize it is the same wheel. It will never top the first two films, but then I doubt anything ever could. It does have enough action and plot twists to keep you guessing and entertained. It's a good, fun time at the movies!

This movie has plenty of nostalgia for fans of the original film from the 80's. Whether you are a Terminator fan or not, you should check this one out!Plus sides - loved the casting. Emilia Clarke looks very similar to Linda Hamilton. Jayson Clarke was GREAT as John Connor, and I enjoyed his portrayal more than that of Christian Bale in the previous film. Jay Courtney was also awesome as Kyle Reese, bringing back an old but favorite and vital character to the storyline. Great soundtrack by the legendary Hans Zimmer. Simple storyline with likable characters and gets serious when it needs to while still leaving room for the humorous Arnold one-liners. I also have to add that the CGI used to bring back a young Arnold was phenomenal!Down sides - this movie has another typical ""time traveling"" storyline, although it wouldn't be much of a terminator film without one but they do get slightly repetitive! The story is a bit rehashed as well, with Arnold coming back in time once again to play the good-guy Terminator, although it really wouldn't work without him! This is also a ""PG-13"" Terminator, so some of the violence, language, and sex (or lack thereof) included is a bit toned-down versus the originals. Lastly, despite being a GREAT film, it doesn't quite ""hit the spot"" with how the original two James Cameron films did. It was very close, though.I really loved this film and it feels like a tried and true sequel to ""Terminator 3"", more close to the premise of the original films than ""Terminator Salvation"" was.

In fact, it was so disgusting that I had to watch it in several segments through 4 days. I mean this was so bad to swallow that I had to watch 30 min. one day and the next day other 30 min. and so on.As a Terminator fan I felt totally insulted. Too bad the mockery seed was planted right at the moment James Cameron felt the need to add comic relief to his T2 and made a terminator force a smile. Then T3 and T4 came up to keep milking the cow and adding more and more nonsense with different directors, different cast and different BS like ""Judgement Day is inevitable."" or John Connor receiving a transplant from a cyborg or a mute kid trying to be Newt from Aliens. However, T3 and T4 tried somehow to keep the first movies untouched and followed a line of continuity. This time they did destroy what was left from T1 and T2. When I was watching Genesys I was thinking ""Damn, they got to the point of no return."" There is no way they could fix all the mess they did here. It's like when you see a celebrity that went through several plastic surgeries only to end up being a monster and not a person anymore.I feel sad. This movie is not only unnecessary but also extremely confusing and BOOORING. The actors were incredibly miscast, ALL of them. The characters that were loved by us are now annoying as hell, you almost hate them! They have no soul, there is no chemistry! Instead there are jokes everywhere, Sarah takes a terminator as a ""daddy"" (Gee, John having uncle Bob was enough!), they keep aiming weapons and shooting at terminators while they perfectly know guns don't stop them... They also shoot at holograms. Isn't that stupid enough? And John Connor is a terminator now? Give me a break! How can you do that to a character who is supposed to be the savior of the world???They not only copied or resembled the good stuff from T1 and T2 in a bad way, they even had the guts to copy ideas from The Sarah Connor Chronicles! Which was actually a good series. The bubble scene in the highway was clearly taken from there.Believe me... the only good thing in this movie was in the closing credits when the melody of The Terminator Theme came back to life, after T3 and T4 totally overlooked it using only the stupid drums as a motto. I wonder if those people knew that The Terminator Theme has actually a melody, not only drums.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, not only because it has a terrible cast, bad writing, bad actors, bad CGI, bad action, no plot, but especially because it did everything it could to destroy a legend.

365,snaidu422,old but not obsolete,8,4 July 2015,"What would be on your mind when you walk into a cinema showing a film of a movie franchise, whose mythology you know like the back of your hand? For starters you think you know everything about every character-the heroes, the villains, and the situations they are put in. The first 10 Min's of TERMINATOR GENISYS puts you at ease with yourself and you think you know what could be in store for you. You start predicting the movie, then the next 5 minutes shocks you into thinking you are actually watching a reboot of the franchise, but then the next 5 minutes makes you stand up and clap for you are actually seeing something which you never expected from a movie franchise which you thought was too predictable!!Discussing the storyline would lead to a lot of spoilers and would ruin the fun for most of you. But locking the surprise as best I can, I will try and discuss the storyline.The movie takes place in a world which is taken over by SKYNET (Artificial intelligence program) and the war is in full swing between SKYNET and a human resistance group headed John Connor (Jason Clarke). The resistance wins the war, but SKYNET in a last attempt to save itself sends a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to 1984 to kill John Connor's Mother Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke)Connor discovers the time machine and realizes what happened and decides to send someone back to save his mother. His good friend and soldier Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) volunteers.In 1984, we witness several scenes which are an exact replica of the first movie and the twist comes when the Terminator is killed by the Terminator from the T-2 movie (Arnold Schwarzenegger again) assisted by an unknown sniper.Kyle arrives similar to the first movie, but the twist here the cop who comes to arrest him is actually the T-1000 (Lee Byung Hun) and who proceeds to terminate him. Kyle is saved by Sarah Connor who to his surprise is teamed up with the T-2 who she calls Pops.Kyle realizes that someone somehow changed an entire time-line and Sarah Connor is not the weakling waitress who he thought she would be.The trio destroy T-1000 and decide to go to 1997 (using a time machine which pops had created) and destroy Genesis, a program which would later be known as sky-net. A quick calculation by Kyle with regard to the changed time-line-it is decided to go to 2017. Since Pops was injured in the battle with T-1000, he decides to stay back since his exposed metal would not allow him to time travel. He promises to wait for them in 2017 with clothes when they land (since time travelers are required to travel naked).Kyle and Sarah land in 2017 and pops gets delayed in traffic and the naked duo get arrested by the cops. And it gets even better when John Connor makes an appearance at the police station and springs them free........Arnold Schwarznegger is back as the terminator and he really proves no one can do it better than him. Though he appears jaded in some scenes on the whole he ensures he is old but not obsolete. The stiff laugh, the crazy one liners, the weird talk, all these are back to remind us of what we used to love about this role.Emilia Clarke as the Iconic Sarah Connor (a role immortalized by Linda Hamilton) is good especially in the action sequencesJai Courtney does his best as Kyle Reese (a role which made Micheal Biehn a household name) and his interactions and arguments with Schwarzenegger are the best in the movie. He is good in the action parts, but is overshadowed by both Schwarzenegger and Emilia.Jason Clarke as the now very famous JOHN CONNOR is a case of excellent casting choice. Fans of the franchise have never seen Connor in action, this movie provides a lot of scenes where we get to see THE JOHN CONNOR in action and yes if not John Connor who can bring a surprise edge of the twist to the franchise and he proves it.Alan Taylor managed to hold his own with this movie-it was tough when the originals have becomes classics and were helm-ed by James Cameron.Laeta Kalorgridis and Patrick Lussier's screenplay is excellent and remains true to the movie mythology and also provides an insight into the first movie and then works its way creating a whole new screen-story. The screenplay does appear confusing at parts, but is handled rather well with the occasional cinematic liberties like the scene where the two kyles meet in the end-theories of time travel do propagate that you cannot meet your future self or past self face to face since it would lead to disintegration of both (a theory which works as a very important plot line for back to the future trilogy)Cinematography by Kramer Morgenthau is mind blowing as it manages to capture most of the action and works in tandem with 3D imagery. The 3D effects are quite decent when compared to the other forced 3D ventures which hit the screens the past few months.I would recommend this movie only to people who are familiar with the TERMINATOR mythology and the time travel Paradox, to the rest it will only be a confusing plot which will go hammer and tongs.To sum it up, I would say this movie earns its respectable place next to Terminator and T2.",Terminator Genisys

If they're going to continue the franchise, this is where they should pick up. I liked the ""Pops"" comeback of the old T800 much more than that ""Carl"" thing they did in the other movie, he was much more relatable. Also, they didn't completely dump on the classic lines like ""I'll be back"", and they used them more sparingly here. It's some kind of idiotic joke that this has the same rating as Dark Fate.",Terminator Genisys
367,arminhage,Just 1 level above totally awful!!!,1,28 September 2015,"First let me say that this review has no spoiler, I just check the box to be on the safe side.Lets get to the point: 1. Endoskeleton if to receive human tissue shell only otherwise it doesn't make sense for machines to produce endoskeletons with TEETH! In the movie we see that machines in the future are primarily endoskeletons without human shell and all of them have teeth. So why do they need teeth? what do they want to eat? human flesh??? Pretty childish flop.2. Apparently machines are so advanced, so why on assault on Colorado base, a puppet endoskeleton (again with TEETH) is riding a truck? Why the truck is not equipped with auto driver and drive itself? That would be acceptable for a 1950s sci-fi and not acceptable even by 80s standards. Yet another awful flop.3. So they found a way to explain why Arnold looks old, cyborg tissue ages like human tissue. Pretty goo explanation except that Cyborg human shell is genetically modified to grow rapidly which means it grows rapidly and it should degrade rapidly on the other side so NO! CYBORG DOES NOT GET OLD NORMALLY, if that's the explanation, Arnold is too young you that reason. Not really as bad as endoskeletons with teeth but Im pretty sure that James Cameron would come with better reasoning.4. 1984 feels like 2099 !!! Also the plot is pretty boring, It's like that you work on your LAPTOP writing paychecks and also listen to movie and do not loose the storyline and special effects look good but nothing really extraordinary, just a better looking CG.Overall boring and full of childish flops and tasteless humor. I rather remember Terminator 1 and 2 and just ignore the hurting knowledge that they ruined the awesome duology with 3 other awful installments, pretty much like what ford did to Jaguar and then ditched it off to an Indian car maker!",Terminator Genisys

And ultimately, that's we as consumers actually require from something we pay for: to be entertained. I appreciate that to writers and performers what they do is ""art"", but with this sort of movie, it really isn't: this is consumer product (like it or not) and as such it doesn't meet the standards that consumers should expect when they pay for cinema tickets or the like.Casting: I hate to be horrible here, but whereas in previous movies characters were played by actors chosen at least in part for their talent, this is the first time I can honestly say that the casting has really focused solely on ""eye candy"" in all the supporting roles and it shows, it really does.I've been generous in giving this movie a 2 because if I'm brutally honest, it doesn't deserve it.",Terminator Genisys
370,ken558,A Mixed Bag and in Parts Just Adding Baggage to Baggage,6,25 June 2015,"Time traveling movies - action or otherwise - always need to be approached with great caution . or rather I should say, with caution thrown to the wind, and simply ignore all the inconsistencies and strained attempt at trying to 'scientifically' or 'logically' justify the 'huh?' Same for this movie.This is made worse, much worse, when the 'scientific' mouthfuls of mumbo-jumbo are made to emanate from the likes of Arnold's garbled enunciation  not once, but multiple times.The first two Ts time-traveling were made palatable bcs it wasn't overplayed and still afford the audience a linear flow of events and do not detract from the story, events and actions unfolding. Not so with this 5th T  another messy time-traveling multi-timelines blah blah and coupled with Arnold's garbling, it just makes you go ""whatever"".If only the script had followed its own advice - ""follow straight down the line and don't look back"".Unnecessary introduction of characters late into the move only adds to the ""whoever, whatever"". A big problem for me is the fooling-around with a main character - won't reveal what/who it is here, but it cheapens the whole franchise with a 'whodunit' nonsensical flip- flops.Making Sarah Connor a no-nonsense go-getter heroine from the start loses the audience's empathy towards this pivotal character  the whole reason Sarah Connor is/was interesting to us ordinary folks is/was mainly because she was supposed to be one-of-us lost fumbling souls thrown into situations that ""we"" tumble around in but somehow found the help and strength and ingenuity to rise from. Well, it doesn't work if this latest Sarah Connor is already way beyond ordinary-folk when we first encounter her, with no inkling that she had ever been one-of-us.I personally welcome the presence of Arnold, like familiar comfort food - both the young and pops versions - only without his garbling of time-traveling-pseudo-science.Jai Courtney's Kyle Reese just doesn't cut it - not sure if its the scripting or just Jai - but he would be good as a sidekick action guy, but not a pivotal romantic action lead. Even his few lines at humor fall flat. Emilia Clarke's Sarah Connor is more frustrating in the sense that she probably would have done a good job of it if the script allowed - but the way it flows, she's got to be this macho fighter upfront, and there is little room after that to be anything else, coupled with Jai's lack of chemistry and presence - not a character that lends sufficient empathy for the audience to root after.Jason's Clarke John Connor - creepily villainous looking from the start. Hmmm, just not the right image for this important character, now twisted out of whack.As it is, it is a mixed bag and in parts just adding baggage to baggage. See it as a brand new un-franchised movie and it'll work fine as a fairly well-done action reel.",Terminator Genisys

Do you enjoy movies like Mega Shark vs Giant Octopuss and Giant Piranha vs Giant squid? Do you like poor scripting, unrealistic dialogue and shopping channel standard acting? If so you're in luck because Terminator Genisys has all this and more! I'm a huge Terminator fan so if you're wondering that's not the reason for my veiled animosity for this film. This is literally how NOT to make a good movie. It is pretty much doomed witting the first ten minutes when you realise they had a disaster with the casting. Jai Courtney is bad, he cannot act simply put. He may be able to cut it as an extra in CSI but how he landed this role is beyond me. I love Emelia Clarke in Game of Thrones but she was just awful here. The terrible script didn't help but she looked awkward and uncomfortable with her lines most of the time. The film's one saving grace? Arnie of course. He is the only thing that prevented me from turning it off half way through as it just got downright boring.

Some funny dialogues and jokes, a lot of insanely exaggerated nonsense... it is definitely better than the last one (mostly due to the absence of Bale). The first ten minutes you will probably get the feeling that this is a complete reboot, but just as you start to get angry about this, it takes a turn. Not that the plot turn is overly smart or original, and it doesn't make sense at all, too - but it saved the movie from being a total disaster. Don't even try to think about the time travel presented in it - it doesn't work, it doesn't make sense - one moment they travel back in their own timeline, the next moment they travelled into a different time branch, just as it suits the action that's going on. Just ignore it. The action is OK, but after a felt dozen of Marvel movies in the last years, nothing can be shown anymore in screen that really makes difference. Been there, seen it.Skynet will live in for another movie and that actually does make sense. Everything that has been invented or explored once can't be unmade after that point. Someone will someday create another Skynet, even if they succeed in totally destroying it. Just as nuclear weapons won't go away just be dismantling weapon arsenals. No need to show that Skynet survived this movie somewhere deep below (hey, it seem it used the same construction companies as Umbrella), AS A GLOWING RED BALL OF LIGHT!!!!

373,TheMunkeyBoy,There was a good idea here,5,1 August 2018,"First off, I Loved the original Terminator and T2 was incredible. I felt T3 wasn't needed and was lacking but, I didn't hate it. I guess it was he female terminator that was the major dosapintment. 
I really enjoyed the fourth film Salvation. I don't know why people didn't like it. It was a good film.
Now Genisys started with some great ideas and I was getting really excited. Using elements of the first 2 films and creating something really hectic crazy. I was into it. 
Then it got stupid. In a lot of ways. 
I don't like to put spoilers in here, so I won't. But, one things is they ruined John Connor and all he is meant to be & stand for. 
Instead of tying in with the originals 2 films it actually crapped on hem and ruined their whole story and the point of John Connor. 
What a twist!? Yes. But, a stupid one. 
John Connor aside, the amount of jumping through time was getting too much. I understand time travel was a part of the first 3 films but, very minimal, the films didn't keep focusing on it. 
Anyway.... nothing wrong with the acting here. No best actor awards I'd give but, everyone was fine. It wasn't the actors faults that this movie is a mess. It's the story and possibly made worse by how it was put together. 
I'd recommend missing this one unless you can handle the mess it makes of the Terminator universe and just view it as a B-Grade flawed SciFi movie on its own.",Terminator Genisys
374,TheMunkeyBoy,What a twist... a stupid twist,5,10 January 2019,"I was enjoying the movie somewhat up unto a point. I liked the inclusion of the first 2 movies into the plot and time jumps.
But, it then got odd.
It got kind of a little stupid. Why would you do that to John Connors character?
That was ridiculous.
The script is the one thing that ruined it all. Can't blame the actors. They did fine. Seen better and seen worse by far.
How did this script get the green light!?I have not hated a single terminator movie. The first 2 are brilliant and the best. I don't care a lot for the 3rd but, it's not a bad movie. The 4th was a pretty good and I've gobe back a few times to watch. But T Genisys is really a slap in the face to all the other movies by the end.

The visual effects were very impressive but this film didn't succeed because it was not well directed or acted (with the exception of Jason Clarke and J.K. Simmons). I was surprised to learn that Alan Taylor has been working successfully as a director. It's apparent that his forte is not working with actors. Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney delivered unprofessional, wooden and uninspired performances for most of the film. Schwarzenegger was very funny. It was obvious he was reading directly from cue cards in many scenes, but it's OK because he was supposed to be robotic. The story was very interesting, but Taylor didn't pull it off. If this film had been directed by a more talented director, it could have been a great. Loud music and amazing special effects didn't fool the audience into thinking this film was on the same level as Terminator 1 or 2. The acting was embarrassingly bad and the director was miscast.",Terminator Genisys

Poor attempts at humor just make it go down faster. I can only assume that everyone needed the money so they made this horrid film. I'm a huge fan of Jason Clarke so I am very saddened to see how bad this film is. He usually picks such great projects to work with I guess he deserves to have one donkey on his resume. This was smelly bad. And what was that quick comment about moonshine? does that reference his Lawless character Howard Bondurant.Emila Clarke riding high on the Game of Thrones cash cow couldn't possibly have picked a worst film to break out of her character. She can hold the American accent like a champ but to play the gun toting bad girl when she is only 5 feet tall weighing in at may a buck 10 tops really doesn't fly.

He's essentially the Vinny Chase of the real world. His portrayal of Kyle Reese is so out of whack. Kyle Reese was never a hulking action hero, but rather a confused and weary soldier conscripted into a war. This is a by the number script through and through.

378,sbulgacs,Not a classic but not bad overall,6,9 August 2015,"None of the Terminator movies are bad per say but after the initial impact of the first and second it seems that the subsequent films have been grasping at straws, to try and ""get the magic"" back rather than be original great movies in their own right. My favourite are 1,2,3 and then Genesis with Salvation at the bottom (mostly due to Sam Worthington being miscast). In this instalment the music was out of place, what happened to the futuristic drum beats, clonks and clanks?There was a feeling of dread to the first 3. There is no similar atmosphere here. In the first movie, as a kid, the dread aspect was overwhelming. With Genysis you know that everything is going to work out in the end. Although this being a Terminator movie something will happen and it will all go pear shaped after the fact. This is to ensure the next instalment of the franchise. Also the emotional element of the T-800 character is totally overplayed. As Arnold stated in T-3 ""Desire is irrelevant I am a MACHINE"". Not so here. Apparently it is all about what the T-800 thinks and ""feels"". The chase scenes are OK but after the ""break through"" action sequences of T-1, T-2 and the wondrous fights in T-3 (only possible due to CGI) these are par for the course and nothing new.As others have mentioned Emilia Clarke does a great job of playing Sarah Connor but in reality Linda Hamilton nailed the character in exactly the same way Sigourney Weaver did in Alien and Aliens. Some characters can only be played so well by the original actors (in context) such as Freddy Kruger, Alice (Resident Evil) or James Bond. Sean Connery nailed Bond and Bond hasn't been played as well since. The Kyle Reese character was miscast he is more eye candy for the ladies in this film than anything else, same as Sam Worthington in T-4.The story itself is convoluted with several time jump scenes. The T-800 explains away these convolutions with a sentence or two of exposition! This left me thinking eh? IMO better than T-4 and a good movie in its own right but comparable to Terminator 1 and 2? No chance. On a side note Byung-Hun Lee playing the T-1000 was eerie. How much he looked and moved like the character from T-2!",Terminator Genisys
379,RustyShacklefordd,"Not Terrible, But Still Disappointing",5,30 June 2015,"I'm a huge Terminator fan, but this one really left me with mixed feelings. Pros: - Arnold Is Great! - I really liked the whole idea of the concept and was impressed that they actually managed to pull it off without messing up the timeline as I feared. - Pacing was great! The film moves fast and never slows down! - Action scenes were pretty good. PG-13 rating didn't really get in the way. Not really any blood, but you still see impact and people die on-screen some people here have said. - I thought the third-act was well-done and even the first-act is pretty decent. Cons: - My biggest problem with the film is the script. The concept is good, but the writing is really weak. It still felt like it was in the draft stages. I feel like it could have been good if they had just done a few rewrites. - As you probably guessed, Jai Courtney stinks! I really don't understand why he keeps getting roles. He has no charisma what-so- ever. Emilia Clarke wasn't as bad, but I felt like she was miscast as well. - I don't think Alan Taylor did a terrible job directing, but he doesn't have a distinctive style that these kind of films need. It honestly felt like anybody could have directed it. - The films tone is caught between capturing the feel of a Terminator movie and then just that of a standard action movie throughout the entire film. I didn't hate it, but I can't really go as far to say I liked it either. They really needed to do a rewrite of the script and recast the actors. I'd say it's passable, but still disappointing knowing what it could have been.",Terminator Genisys

But that doesn't mean that genisys is awful or crap or unworthy of the label Terminator.To me, genisys is a very good action film and at least a passable terminator movie. The story adds some new aspects and stays true to the formula for the most parts. The actors do their parts well. Especially the roles of Kyle Reese and John Connor are played superb and even Emilia Clarke fits as a young Sarah Connor. Arnold is out of competition. He is just Arnold. The fx are properly done, the action is on full throttle, and the pacing is fast.So, all In all, genisys is neither as influencing as T1 nor a milestone like T2.

There are no words to describe how awful this is. They couldn't have made it any worse even if they tried. Everything from the acting to the script to the special effects is absolutely laughable. And yes I did start laughing at some point, thinking 'what the hell is going on here?'.

383,pulikd,TERMINATORS. Fighting Fate,6,2 January 2021,"""Genisys"" is not a sequel to ""Salvation"". It is not even a sequel to the original two films. It does not develop that old story. It reaches for the very core of that story and points it in a different direction. Here, the time machine is not just a means to go back in time and alter an event. Here, it is a tactical weapon that can be used multiple times. Time itself has become a battle field.John Connor, Kyle Reese, Sarah Connor and Guardian are all interesting characters. Despite dealing with technology and cold strategy, the plot is very human at heart. The cast was great, especially Jason Clarke. What surprised me, though, is how good Jai Courtney turned out to be in a heroic role. As a villain, say, in ""Jack Reacher"", Courtney was brilliant. As a hero, though, he was not impressive in the fifth ""Die Hard"", and I seriously doubted if casting him here was a good idea. I was wrong. And Arnold, in spite of his age, was wonderful in every way. Also, unlike some other new installments in old film franchises, ""Terminator: Genisys"" does not bring back the old actor only to ruin the familiar character. Arnold has a big part, and a meaningful one.Not all is well, though. What immediately sets this movie apart from all the four before it, is how much CGI it has. And not all of it was good. There is not one evil terminator, there are several. But it does not matter because two of them get destroyed with relative ease. And the third one has a ridiculous weak spot. Magnets. What makes the robot interesting is not what it technically is, but what the actor does with the part. Regardless, terminators are no longer scary.Then there is the plot. Multiple timelines, points connecting them, people and machines going from timeline to timeline. Like I said before, the film has a heart. But as for the logic, well, the less you think about the plot, the better. Not that it does not make any sense, but it could have been a direct sequel to the franchise instead of what it is.In conclusion, the plot is dramatic but problematic, like ""Salvation"". Unlike ""Salvation"", though, it has a sense of humor and does not want to be extremely serious. Visually, ""Genisys"" is easily the worst terminator film yet. Too much CGI.",Terminator Genisys
384,the_bluesman,The best Terminator since T2!,8,13 August 2015,"I have no idea what all the critics expected this movie to be. This is an entertaining action movie with an engaging story, good actors and top-notch special effects.I must admit that I also had low expectations after the disaster of a movie that was TERMINATOR: SALVATION a few years back, but I was very positively surprised with how much fun TERMINATOR GENISYS turned out to be for me. I think this is a good addition to the Terminator series of movies that is well-cast with Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor, Jason Clarke as John Connor, Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger in his classic role as the Terminator. I actually had my doubts that this cast could work but it does and I'm really surprised how well Emilia Clarke pulled off the iconic role of Sarah Connor. By the way, it was also a treat to see the fabulous J.K. Simmons, probably one of the most talented character actors ever, in his relatively small role as O'Brien.While SALVATION was utter garbage and RISE OF THE MACHINES was entertaining but not on par with its predecessors, GENISYS is definitely the best Terminator since T2 in my book. It is reminiscent of the first two Terminator movies and pays homage to them in many ways. I like the idea of the alternate timelines and think that the writers did a great job to make it work. It's good that the filmmakers stayed true to the style of parts one and two of the franchise. I also appreciate that they consulted James Cameron about the plot and got his support. I hope there will be more Terminator sequels, hopefully with the same main cast.",Terminator Genisys
385,fabiolpinheiro1993,Arnold is by far the greatest thing in a film that has great ideas but squanders them in a lazy clichéd and uninspired script.,7,7 July 2015,"I am a huge Terminator fan, and while the trailers did make me excited about genisys, i never had high hopes, but i got to say...While i enjoyed the film, i am a little disappointed, because the film its just very low key.The beginning of the film, the usual monologue, is nothing special, in fact we could have seen for the first time the judgment day happening all around the world in detail and an epic long sequence, but instead we get 2 seconds of lazy destruction. Then we see the resistance taking down skynet in another 2 lazy seconds of action, when we could see another great action sequence of one of the most important scenes in the terminator mythology.Then the film plays with timelines. I really don't agree with everyone that says the film is just a recreation, shot by shot, of the first two films. Yes the film spends some time revisiting some iconic scenes but it isn't that much time, and its very funny because they add twists that are cool. And i think that they are a lot of fun for who really knows the first films, but everyone can enjoy them anyway.The plot is lazy, it seems like someone had a ton of cool ideas and then they just decided to put them together without any idea of how to create something great or interesting. They have a lot of exposition however there's tons of things left to explain. The pace is terrible, and i don't agree with everyone saying that the actors give bad performances, thats not their fault, but the scripts fault, the dialogue is very cheesy, and lazy. There's definitely some great ideas and something special in the middle of all that, but it feels like the script is a draft, and it needed a great rewrite and a lot of work. It's like they wrote everything for the first time and that's it. We live in the time of technology, how hard it would be to adapt the saga to this age, and create some great story with skynet and a theme that people can relate to?! The action is lazy, uninspired, low key, and it's from other films. The director has no creativity or originality. There's no visual style. Every action sequence lasts 2 seconds. They could made a huge sequence out of the fight between the old terminator and the new one (both Arnold) but it was over before it started. The actors are great, i love them all, and they tried their best against a lazy script, and while is a strange feeling seeing Arnold as an old terminator, it is very cool, it adds something special to the character. And Arnold Schwarzenegger is really the best thing in this film, he shines brighter than everything even if he doesn't appear as much as i would like.The film should be 30 minutes longer, it would give time to explain everything, since most of time, things happen for no reason, develop characters, since J.K Simmons appears for 2 seconds, and every character seems to be there just to give exposition, and add more action! The film never gains momentum or excitement, and has a climax that is not a climax, its just a lazy sequence, that has one great moment thanks to Arnold, a fight that is cool but once more it is over 2 seconds after beginning.The visual effects are just amazing at times, like the 1984 Arnold (terminator) and the bridge sequence, and the new terminator (that isn't) but most of the time is terrible, like the beginning. The score is cliché and lazy, the sound is great, especially in imax, and the cinematography is also great. The film has no suspense, no mysteries, no nuances, no originality, no creativity, even with an awesome twist (ruined in the trailers) they didn't make anything cool with it. Overall i enjoyed the film, but it is very lazy, and i am a bit disappointed. Say what you want about Salvation, but at least it had originality, will to create something different, explain a lot of things during the war times before skynet created the t 800 and laser beams and time machines, some of the best visual effects ever and awesome action scenes. This is by far the worst terminator film, but that doesn't make it a bad film either, just... lazy. The only reason i give this a 7 is because of Arnold, the man can make up for a lot of bad stuff.",Terminator Genisys
386,baberchik,"terminator ""meh..""isys",4,16 July 2015,"Seeing how this was yet another extremely hyped up movie (as is most of Hollywood ""quantity over quality"" mass production) this movie was a letdown. So much so I want to watch Terminator (the first one) over again just to remind myself what they have taken as a basis for this rehash. The plot is somewhat unusual for the franchise as it takes more of an ""Interstellar"" approach having a fair attempt at a specific type of plot basis that is very hard not to make sound stupid: time travel. Not just some time travel but time travel all over the place! A completely stupid twist IMHO was the concept that this time Kyle Reese should be the ""terminator"", and an even cheesier approach was to give Skynet some kind of a human face in both Kyle and that hologram near the end. What was in my opinion a part of the general T movies appeal was the faceless, merciless never-tiring death that was the Skynet/Terminators collective. A machine that just kills because human death is as easy and logical for it as for a calculator to display a number. This part of the plot is so bad, that YET AGAIN is there an assault on the 5th wall when the T-1000 (Arnold) says ""Kyle Reese talks too much"". Seriously???? What was missing there was having T-1000 say ""no 10 stars on IMDb now"". Good God... This time however it went all wishy- washy to give more of an ""antihero"" appeal to Kyle Reese/Skynet, which basically ruined it for me. This is supposed to be a machine, not some hyped up mix between Dr Evil and Inspector Gadget.Keep in mind that if ALL the other T movies were about thrill/action, this one is more of a cluster**** of several things, where these two things: time travel and twists because of time travel as well developed characters with personalities where there should be no personalities. That's literally it! Spiced up with some decent action scenes, but nothing like Terminator Salvation. As if this was not cheesy enough, there were some one-liners where the 5th wall was kinda torn down by none other than Arnold with lameness like ""My human exterior is aged, but I can still hear"" and ""I am old, not obsolete"" (the latter was repeated several times... yeah, really!). Sorry Arnold, if it's going to be jokes about your age and appearance then you might as well replace action scenes with gag scenes and call this movie ""Ol'Arnold: Retirement home Genisys"". Act the role, no one gives a hoot about how old you are, I want to see a MOVIE character not your old age complex!All in all I am confused by this movie which is at best a good summer action movie, but it is a lightyears away from the masterpiece that was T2 and T4. Whoever directed this nonsense should do comedies with Rob Schneider from now on, to have them screened in nearly empty second rate cinemas.",Terminator Genisys
387,templar77099,Dazzed and Confused,5,14 July 2015,"Well, I don't know what to say, really! I just don't know. I guess I 'm not dumb but in what concerns to the rebooting of the Terminator Timeline, my mind just exploded. Half an hour into the movie and I just lost track of the whole plot.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film. The action scenes were awesome and this was probably the best Arnie performance in the whole franchise, at least, the one where his character was humanized the most. Besides the confused (at least for me) plot, the film was quite good and I don't even know where the ""Hate"" for this comes from. Despite not matching the Sarah Connor of Linda Hamilton, I really loved the one of Emily Clarke too, and I think she really needs to appear in more movies than she is currently in, because I can't get enough of her - ""Call me Daenerys Targaryen(...) and if you fill the love you can call me khaleesi."". Jason Clarke is not as bad as some people say in the role of John Connor, I quite liked him. The only issue that I had was with Jai Courtney. He is not the most talented actor in Hollywood and watching him being so but so below the performance of Michael Biehn was quite shameful. Besides that, I think they should have explored a bit more Matt Smith's character and despite being quite good, the new T-1000 doesn 't stand a chance against the one of Robert Patrick. J.K. Simmons is also underused. Finally, Alan Taylor is not a bad director, at all. I mean, have you seen the old Arnie VS Young Arnie fight scene? Despite being brief, it showcases his skill to direct such scenes. Genesys is truly a better movie than his latest ""Thor : Dark World"". But the greatest achievement on Genysis is indeed CGI. After the trash we saw in Salvation this was really superb. There are even people saying it deserves an Oscar nod and I agree, because, when you recreate Arnie 's face from 1984 and it IS realistic, you deserve an nod and even the Oscar.""The rules have been reset"" is the film's tagline. Well, the one thing that was reseted when I was leaving the theater was my brain, so beg a pardon, but I've got to search on forums or Youtube to understand the new timeline.",Terminator Genisys
388,diogomanuel,Someone really wanted to make an homage to the Terminator series,3,5 December 2017,"And there is nothing wrong about homages... When they are done right! Which I don't think it is the case with this one.The story line is borderline chaotic going back and forth and sometimes left (yes, weird) and tries to be way more appealing to those who have never watched a Terminator movie than to the Terminator fans.I understand that there is a whole new generation that never saw one Terminator, let alone all of them... But they did call this one Genesis (spelling mistake and all), which means that they want the Terminator fans to see this. When someone tries to make something great for two completely different groups, they are asking for trouble as they want to achieve the impossible! Adding insult to injury they have also decided to constantly repeat the lines that made this movie popular even if they don't make sense in the context, and use CGI tricks that define logic to the core. After watching it, and as a fan of the Terminator, I don't think I've wasted my time but I know this could have been done way better than it was.I'm sure that even Schwarzenegger wasn't happy with the end result, as during the movie his acting was too weird, almost feeling like he went with the 'don't care' flow and just gave up. The 'Mother of Dragons' Emilia Clarke impersonated today's woman of I can do everything and be a bad ass of a Mother but again the end result is just weird as a sequence to the 80's and 90's movie of ""we have to protect her"" (and the whole human race!). This should have been called 'Mum and Pop against the machine' or something else rather than Terminator. Other than Schwarzenegger and some androids that look like the old ones, there isn't a true Terminator vibe in the movie, just a collage of materials that supposedly made Terminator what it is... But they got it all wrong.",Terminator Genisys

It is rare that we see a movie rated 9.0 or higher by the IMDB users, but this was one that my girlfriend rated 9.5 and I rated 8.5 so we will give it a 9.0.It is not without its flaws, but compared to Terminator 1 and 2 in the early days, it has far fewer flaws than both of them combined.

390,Critomaton,"Somewhere in an alternate time-line, the Terminator franchise isn't ruined",3,12 July 2015,"But in our time-line, it has been sold out by a hollow, shameless mess of a movie. OK, maybe it's not completely shameless. It does make the first two look a lot better in comparison (not that their reputation or cultural impact needed any enhancement). It also makes T3 look a lot better and even had me thinking I'd judged Terminator Salvation too harshly (but only for a few minutes). And it's always nice to see Arnold reprise the role of his lifetime. But that's about it.The homage was nice, I liked that the same garbage truck was on hand for young Arnold's appearance and the driver looked and sounded similar. I liked that the one punk said ""Nothing clean, right?"" He added the ""right"" to make the joke clearer - I appreciate that since it took me a few viewings of the original to get the joke.The poor casting choices almost seem like they were done out of deference to the original movie, as if it was obvious nobody could surpass Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn, so why bother? If that was their goal, they hit a home run. Jai Courtney's acting was horrible. Emilia Clarke's was less horrible. Most of the few attempts at humor fell completely flat, and their reactions to everything made no sense.Like, the first time Kyle Reese said ""We have to kill Skynet before it even comes online!"", Sarah Connor was like ""What?!?"" I'm not sure why she was so surprised, that's been her plan in pretty much every time-line.The time travel storyline is convoluted. I don't think even the scriptwriters were trying to make it work, they just wanted it to be confusing. I totally didn't care which time-line they were in or affecting or anything.The big action set pieces were really disappointing. Wow, a bus flipped over. An armored car crashed through a clothing store. Some terminators got melted or demagnetized. I'm actually glad they got rid of the liquid terminator pretty early on - I didn't want to see a complete rehash of T2.On the other hand, the nanobot terminator is even more ridiculous than the liquid alloy terminator. It disassembles and reassembles with no rhyme or reason and no consequences to it ever.Without doubt the helicopter chase ruined the movie - it was insanely fake and cartoony and made every other attempt at ""sci-fi realism"" pointless. Even the helicopter chase in Furious 7 was better and it was fake and cartoony too.I did like that John ConnorBot realized he couldn't kill Sarah Connor or Kyle Reese. That was an interesting conundrum. It was the one minute in the movie when I was engaged and interested; it lasted about a minute.All in all, this totally forgettable film doesn't reboot the series or advance it in any way whatsoever.",Terminator Genisys

I appreciate Arnold reprising his role but gives basic straight forwardness to his role in the story although I did enjoy the brief present Terminator vs past Terminator. I felt this didn't do much justice but just gave everyone reversed roles with a comic book ending.,Terminator Genisys

I loved how they brought back the younger Arnold which had been shown on the trailers. To me it looked so real they could make a Terminator with the younger Arnold and not even use Arnold except for his voice. But this movie had great action, acting, plot, storyline, and creativity. I loved how they brought in the original story line from the first movie. It held my attention from moment to moment. I don't know how you could rate this anything less than 10. Great movie.

Let's talk about what's good about this movie: The directing is good, the dialog is also pretty good, the action is great, the special effects were awesome, the humor was handled perfectly, the script was good, the plot twist was surprising and Arnold still looks in shape and awesome.One thing before I start talking about the cons, here's a quick advice: DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER. I saw it when it came out and ruins some parts in the movie, that even before you get to a certain scene, you'll be like ''oh, I know what will happen''. The trailer was pretty bad and revealing.Now the cons: It doesn't feel like ''the perfect film'', not a single scene was remarkable, there was nothing major or outstanding about this film, the actor who played Kyle was good at best, Sarah Connor was also kind of good, overall the best part about this film is Arnold as always.This guy gets the best lines, his action scenes are great and overall he's damn awesome here.So far, I would rank the franchise like that: 1. T2 2. T1 3. T5 4. T3 5. T4",Terminator Genisys

396,maddog-50,Bombs at box office for one ... err . . . 4 reasons:,1,7 July 2015,"The disastrous miscast of Jai Courtney, Emilia Clarke, Jason Clarke and an equally talentless director named Alan Taylor.The script was not that bad, Arnold was perfect, the CGI was top-notch, but the movie bombed because there where too many talentless people involved. The quite convoluted plot could have been saved by stronger and more convincing character impressions. With Arnold alone, you could go through plot holes of the size of a bomb crater. But the Terminator naturally isn't there to explain things.As the counterpart of a robot you certainly need some strong developed characters. Therefore the casting is absolutely vital!Jai Courtney has the charisma of a cut out cardboard. This talentless hack acts like non-stop posing in front of a mirror whilst looking how pretty his stupid face is. His screen presence is like an empty hull. He has no ability to transport any believable emotion whatsoever. This wannabe James Dean Aussie ruined the Die Hard franchise, and now this one.Emilia Clarke acts hysterically like a little rookie who freaks out about being in a big big mooovie. She's unable to transport the mixture of emotions which made the Sarah Conner character so great: a deep inner conflict between the life she expected to live as an innocent girl and the apocalyptic world what will be reality very soon where she has to fight for everything.Emilia Clarke simply and stupidly portraits Sarah Conner as an action figure with a one dimensional vision of the world. That maybe not her fault alone, but i doubt that she could have done it any better. This iconic character was totally out of her range.Jason Clarke is a terrible miscast as villain. He is nowhere at any time a John Conner. This miscast has the same laughable proportions like Richard Roxburgh as Dracula in Van Helsing . . .What is it with that talentless Aussie connection here anyway? So, Kyle Reese is a fashion poser, Sarah Conner an American Idol candidate and John Conner is a car salesman. The casting director should never work in the business again! It is un.be.lie.vable how one can screw up a casting so badly. The casting ruined the movie completely!The one-eyed king of that mess is Alan Taylor. Who the f* thought it would be a good idea to let him direct that iconic franchise?? Alan Taylor has absolutely no glue, what the Terminator world is all about, and he didn't understand a fart what made the first 2 Terminator movies so successful. He was not able to bring any deep into the story, he simply directed it as an action vehicle for his star Arnold.What a very disappointing waste of time. The script had so much potential and Arnold is truly back! Hopefully, when Cameron got the rights back, they are gonna make one final chapter with Arnold.",Terminator Genisys

(Let's skip T3 and T4) Considering Genisys as 3rd installment, what you'd expect from a Terminator sequel is; an ""Arnold"", the script, the budget and the action. Genisys has all but the action. Yes there is great script that makes you think they spent half of the budget of movie to have written a good script. That's why less action we have. They have Byung-hun Lee who is the most busy actor in the world is at set. He can be easily our new T1000 of recent generation. But they choose stop the action, giving fancy clues and let us connect the dots between T1 & T2 and Genisys. I am pretty sure the most Terminator fan will enjoy when they see the nice surprises of the script. Also many of fan will be disappointed with lack of action. This movie needs 30 min. more action and 60 min. more Byung-hun Lee.",Terminator Genisys

There were car chases and fights, attempts to recreate parts of the other films but it was a hodge podge from all the others but not really jelling.It proves that some people and franchises don't know when to get off the stage.All summer 2015 has been a string reasons not to go to the cinema, one bad film after another with no excuse for any of it.I have Netflix and other forms of entertainment.

399,shadowyx12,They should have just left it alone.,5,14 July 2015,"In short, 'Terminator Genisys' not only fails to live up to the first two films in the franchise but completely retcons them. Now normally, this wouldn't have been such a huge problem for me if the script was given a decent story (preferably, one that would trump the stories of the first two films). Unfortunately, the Ellison siblings (the producers) picked two of what could be known as Hollywood's worst screenwriters to be in charge of the script (I checked their credits).However, I still have to give them credit for taking a huge risk and overhauling the existing timeline - it just didn't work out as well as I hoped. The whole ride just felt bloated, convoluted, and at many times, too convenient. The characters aren't all that engaging either. Both Sarah Connor's and this version of the T-800's past lives could have been made a little more exciting. Aside from the few bouts of excitement I received from watching this movie, I honestly didn't feel all that much else. Speaking of characters, I also felt that both Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney (especially) were miscast in their respective roles as Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. For me, I found Clarke's portrayal of Sarah to be too snarky and sarcastic. When it came down to her more emotional moments, I felt like she lacked a certain intensity when revealing her painful childhood memories.Courtney came off just as snarky and annoying as Clarke. On top of having no chemistry with her, it seems that he doesn't have chemistry with any of the characters of the film. Unlike the Kyle Reese of the first film, this Kyle Reese feels like a cartoon character rather than an actual person - something that doesn't really help out Mr. Courtney.Arnold was good as always - even if he does come off as really cheesy in certain moments.The VFX... still look as good as they did twenty-one years ago (well, as the least the liquid metal for the T-1000 does).And don't worry - the score from this movie won't be replacing the good old original 'Terminator' theme anytime soon.'Terminator Genysis' will certainly be one of those 'love it or hate it' films. Some people might love this movie because they've seen the third and fourth movies and thought they were terrible. For me personally, 'Terminator Genysis' ultimately boils down to nothing more than a generic sci-fi action film that comes off as trying too hard to impress fans while stroking its own ego. In other words, it feels like another weak installment in the franchise.They should have just left it alone.",Terminator Genisys

I hope the franchise does not suffer any more due to these sloppy attempts at recreating the Man vs Machine war . I am still waiting for a decent action movie that can be compared to the original two terminator movies or may be better .

401,JohnnyWeissmuller,Please Terminate this Franchise!,4,25 October 2015,"Terminator: Genisys is the fifth movie in a franchise that has the perfect symmetry in the original The Terminator and Terminator 2. Everything since has been superfluous and a bit pointless, although there's been plenty of ambition to keep going with these movies, which have done well at the box office. The latest film seems to be short of current box office estimates despite tons of promotion, although I think it will do well internationally. It's good to see Arnold's profile raised once again, but this isn't a particularly good movie. It's not poor, but it treads a lot of familiar ground with the idea of doing something new and creating an alternative reality, much in the same way X-Men: Days of Future Past done. But this is much less successful because the story isn't particularly good. It's quite novel at first, and the special effects that create the younger Arnold from The Terminator are really amazing. In a recent interview on the set of his movie Aloha, Cameron Crowe commented on how he would like to see a CGI Elvis in a Wes Anderson movie. This kind of thing really is possible now and has never been better realised than in Terminator: Genisys. Which drew me in on nostalgia and the initial concept, but soon lost me with characters who are easy to relate to but impossible to get behind because who they are relies on other, better movies, with different actors. The plotting is also quite poor and very obvious, but the pace is generally good and Arnold is certainly game. There's not much menace or danger to his T800 now, and even the T1000 isn't as impressive as it was in T2. There's frequent nods to the first movies, but this film sorely needed more of its own identity.",Terminator Genisys

The few moments that provide the film with a glimmer of entertainment and excitement is when Emilia Clarke shows off her wild- side, and when Schwarzenegger pulls off the action-fuelled stunts.

406,kingkass,The Best One Since T2!,7,24 June 2015,"In this review I'm going to briefly go over my thoughts on the franchise as a whole and then dig into this one. 'The Terminator' is a great, dark and mysterious sci-fi action and horror movie from the 80s. It introduced us to this story of man killing machine sent back in time to play with the future. We see Arnold as the T-800 who is sent to kill Sarah Connor (a helpless waitress) so that she will never give birth to the leader of the rebellion, John Connor. We then see Kyle Reese get sent back in time to save Sarah Connor. 9/10In the next film T2 Judgement Day we are introduced to Arnold again, playing a different role. Now the savior of young John Connor. The new threat is the T1000, who is definitely the most fearsome machine in this franchises history. This film is the best in the franchise, not just for its immense visual upgrades but also for the fact that we see likable characters with depth. 10/10T3 is the third film which is an okay action film but lacks the depth in every way compared to previous installments. 6.5/10Terminator Salvation was the reboot/prequel to this franchise and is by far the worst one. It has some bad acting mixed with a terribly depressing tone which goes against the whole nature of this franchise and all in all feels like a completely different film. It is not a Terminator film and by itself it isn't that much better. 5.5/10Now let's get to the one we want to hear about. Terminator Genisys looked terrible in the first two trailers. It looked forced and the visuals looked horrendous. However this turned out to be one of the biggest surprises this year! The story jumps through all the different times that we have come to know from the first two films, and wow am I happy I had just seen the first film before hand. I mean there was so many little hints to the first film that were done so well. The story may be a bit confusing for some people, but as a fan of time travel movies I was happy, I mean I like doctor who so this was child's play for me. I don't want to get too much into it but the two things that stand out from the story for me was the connection between Sarah Connor and the T800 and also the 'twist' of John Connor becoming the main villain (this is a curse with this franchise, moments that would have been awesome twists in the movies are shown in the trailers). The relation with Sarah Connor and Arnie is heartwarming and I actually prefer it to the John Connor and Arnie relationship from T2! Jason Clarke is one of my favorite up and coming actors and he did really well in this role, he looked really menacing and the way we see his reveal is amazing! The visuals and the action are top notch! There are some extremely satisfying action scenes in this movie, and most of the effects are practical and not just filled with CGI which I LOVE! It looks so much better and realistic and for me it shows so much more effort from the film makers to have done this! The T1000 played by Byung Hung-Li is awesome, he is so much fun to see and although we will never have the same feeling of seeing such amazing CGI again there are some moments which look absolutely incredible, subtle things that go a long way! John Connor also looks incredible, and I LOVE his special moves! The visuals are fantastic in this movie, the best being the recreation of Arnie from the first film in CGI, this is the best CGI I have ever seen and I think it's worth an Oscar! At least a nomination, it looks much better than Jurassic World's visuals.Now my biggest problem is Jai Courtney, he is just so lifeless in this, as I think he is in everything he makes. Yes he looks strong, but he doesn't connect at all, and the poor delivery of his lines is just laughable! Hopefully we won't have to see him again in future installments...Overall this is a great action movie, not as good as Mad Max, but much better than Jurassic World! And as a massive Terminator fan, I'm happy we finally got a movie that I can say is worthy to be part of the franchise.Solid 8/10",Terminator Genisys

They have taken the original storyline of time travel, turned it on its head and ruined a great sci-fi storyline.There is something to be said when the best actor in the movie is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Jai Courtney plays the same character in every movie and as always is unbelievably bad at it. ""Hey this has been sanctioned by James Cameron, so it must be good right?"" No! is the simple answer to that. Other than the very underrated J.K. Simmons who seems to play a very believable likable character, the rest of the movie is a miss mash of try hard rehashed nonsense. See it if you have nothing else to watch but not the type of movie you would watch again and again. This is no T2, its not even close, if you want to see how a follow up to a movie should be done watch Star Trek into Darkness. Which i'm sure the screen writers of this have done, and thought ""hey we can do something similar"".

Sure the dialogue is clunky as hell, the convoluted time travel conceits don't ever really make sense and despite one decent twist it's a tad predictable. But hey this is blockbuster cinema and the action is great, the film rattles along at pace and the acting is genuinely not bad (Courtenay spending a large part of the film topless didn't hurt either!). But you can't escape the legacy. This IS supposed to be part of the Terminator mythology. Despite Arnie's best comedic efforts (he steals most scenes he's in) you can't get past what an inferior addition this is to join at least two of the most iconic sci-fi films of the 20th century.

The most amazing terminator which makes the movie more fun and entertaining.,7,12 November 2017,"Terminator Genisys: Movie Review.The performance of Arnold and Emilia Clarke is enjoyable. They have given a fantastic performances. The most entertaining thing in the movie are the funny one liners and punch lines delivered by Arnold's Terminator Character. Some Science Fiction elements, time travel elements and explaining some unexplained scenes is done brilliantly. Action Sequences, CGI Visuals looks good especially the bus chase scene sequence on the bridge is done beautifully. The Action Visuals looks great. The story line and time line plot of Terminator Genisys is set in both past and future. The direction of Alan Taylor is good but could have been much more better. The main issue and flaw of the film is that it lacks the best elements of first and second terminator movies. The timeline plot sometimes is too much confusing for some audience and the story plot line seems to be off the course. The script at certain points seems underwhelming and too much overloaded with unnecessary elements. Some characters are totally underdeveloped especially the negative characters. Some action scenes and CGI looks unrealistic and overdone.But, All over Terminator Genisys is good movie and a satisfying entry to Terminator Movie Series. The movie is definitely much better than Terminator 3 and 4 (Terminator 3 and Terminator: Salvation). Arnold is no doubt the best part of the Terminator Genisys.For Arnold, (He is Old, but not obsolete), and He is Back. (Once again, one of the entertaining performances by Arnold).In My Opinion (My Opinion Only) : I like Terminator Genisys better than Terminator 3 Rise of Machines and Terminator 4 Salvation. in my opinion I think Terminator Genisys is much more better than 3 and 4 and is a good reference sequel to 1st and 2nd Terminator Movie. I will rank Terminator Genisys 3rd best after 1st and 2nd Terminator Movies.James Cameron's Terminator and Terminator T2 Judgement Day will always going to be the best and one of my most favorite movies of all time. But, Terminator Genisys will also be in my list of good movies.The Terminator: The Best. (Ranking 2). T2 Judgement Day: Better Than The Best. (Ranking 1). Terminator Genisys: Better. (Ranking 3). Terminator 3 and Terminator 4 (Rise of Machines and Salvation): Yeah, just OK.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others.

411,deltaforce7,"Confused, slow, poorly cast",1,25 September 2015,"I don't know where to begin. I am used to the Hollywood flops. They produce garbage. But the increasing scale of the stinky force of this garbage keeps me amazed at the complete loss of everything that Hollywood used to represent. And this flick is no exception. Let me list the ""pluses"" first: 1) Arnie. I always liked him. Even when he played in some so-so movies. This is The End of the ""pluses"".Now, for the endless ""minuses"" of this poor joke of a movie. 1) I can't stand this tradition of hiding poor SFX and bad camera-work with total darkness. Most of today's bad video games and movies are ""shot"" in this stupid darkness. If I can't see anything, then I won't be a part of it! 2) The ENDLESS, boring, lengthy dialogues intended for a mentally-challenged viewer are unbearable! Everyone talks mind-numbingly, slowly, lengthily, explaining everything for that ""special student"" sort of a viewer. 3) Except for the good old, unavoidable Arnie, the casting is ATROCIOUS. The ""lovely"" Clarkes family is so miscast that I cannot find the right critical words to describe it. WHY ARE THEY EVEN IN THIS MOVIE??? Neither Jason (who looks like some sort of a pervert), nor Emilia (who looks like a nobody-next-door and could not possibly look less than the Sarah Connor character) appear to be in any way convincing in their roles. Besides, their acting purely stinks. IT STINKS. Like garbage. 3) Jai Courtney CANNOT ACT. Period. I cannot make myself discuss him any further. 4) ""Byung-hun Lee"" playing the T-1000 ?????????? Seriously? If you do not know why I question this casting, then you have to watch the original two Terminator movies. Or, at least, the second one. I usually like them Asian actors, but this is probably THE worst miscasting ever. 5) The 40mm grenades do not detonate like this - neither with this effect nor from these distances. If you don't know how they work, then try to learn something or join some military force or something. 6) The makers of this dumb flick did not know what they were filming, what history this story had and built over the years. So they didn't care about it, and they felt bored about this whole subject. It is totally obvious. Look, if you do not like a certain subject, then do not get involved in it! It's common sense, morons! But then again, we're talking about Hollywood... 7) HORRIBLE ACTING! Who the heck casts ""actors"" who can't act at all??? This crap movie is probably the greatest way to stop screwing the Terminator classic. Leave us with the originals, if you cannot and will not make anything sane to add to it.AFAIMC, I will watch The Sarah Connor Chronicles. Again. The mentally-challenged exec who cancelled this series should be proud of his/her/whatever stupidity. Period.",Terminator Genisys

There are also some very nice references back to T1. The CGI is great and better than most as-is Hollywood movies. The story is trustworthy and entertaining.

Me and my hubby decided to wait for this to come to ted box rather than see it in the theater. Boy are we glad we did. Wr actually hate wasting the dollar and fifty cents we spent at red box. We should have saved our money as well as our time that we can't get back. From the start to finish, the acting was horrendous. Once again Hollywood takes a great movie from the past and remakes it without the heart and soul that made the original so great. In the first Terminator, there was perceived danger and you actually cared about the fate of Sarah and Reece. Not so in this reboot. I wanted Sara's character to be killed within the first scenes she was inI didn't care about any of the characters at all. They picked the wrong people to play the major characters. There wad zero chemistry between the actors playing Sara and Reece. The plot,oh the plot. Who cares about logic, this is a sci-fi movie, we can just make up stuff, say a lot of scientific gobbly gook and call it a storyline. I guess they figured if they uses big science words and quantum physic terminology the audience would not figure out that their plot line was totally ridiculous. Those who give this movie a positive review say to ignore the plot and just enjoy the action. Ah, yes the obviously cgi, boring, been here done that scenes they called action was sleep inducing. You can tell the pg13 rating. The cheesy dialog. The roll your eyes attempts at humor. They just leave logic completely out the door. In the end they defeat skynet preventing the war, if this is the case, adult Reece should have disappeared because he would exist since there was no war. That is one of many, makes-no- sense plot lines. The only good thing is, since we had to DVD, we could fast forward through the boring dialogs.

414,Habibi-Universe,Ohhhh... So Many Timelines!!!,5,13 November 2020,"Alan Taylor's 'Terminator Genisys' (2015) is the 5th film (Yeah I know, it's crazy, right?) in the 'Terminator' franchise and it is about Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) going back in time to protect Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke).I find it absolutely hilarious, but also a bit frustrating that the studio seems to really want to suck all the air out of the 'Terminator' franchise until it isn't profitable anymore. This franchise could have been done after its first film, but Cameron decided to direct a second film and obviously pulled off a fantastic sci-fi action film beloved by the film fan community! Then, 12 years later, the third 'Terminator' film came along and, in a way, set up the fourth film in 'Terminator Salvation'! The ending of 'Salvation' could have easily been the finale of the franchise, yet they still weren't done with it and decided to make 'Terminator Genisys'.Let me now talk about the fifth film, 'Terminator Genisys'.
First of all, I would like to commend the film for its first 40 minutes which showed a lot of great potential as well as a ton of nostalgia coming through for the fans of the franchise! I actually really liked that section of the film because it felt somewhat like 'Back to the Future Part II' by going back to a time we are already familiar with from the first two 'Terminator' films!However when that first third of the film is over, the movie turns into this confusing science fiction film that demonstrates so much familiarity from the franchise's first two iterations.
Another problem with the film is that it struggles when it comes to the pacing as it moves closer to the end.
I know I've said it before, but I'll say it again because it is so important: this film is CONFUSING! It really gets hard following the logistics of time travel or at least this film's understanding of said phenomenon!Overall, 'Terminator Genisys' is a film that seemed promising, but wasted so much of its potential due to bland, generic storytelling! Failing to bring back the glory of the franchise, this iteration remains predictable at the end of the day! 5/10",Terminator Genisys
415,gotohoward,Confusing Mess,4,4 July 2015,"I've seen them all. Most of us have. You would think with a huge budget they'd churn out a winner with Arnie back on board. They mess with multiple times lines which just makes the movie confusing, and short of the kind of suspense and action they had in the first two. They copy the first one almost exactly with the same line and scenes, then ad a few updates as the film moves into the 2nd and 3rd acts. On the plus side they fill in some of the back story to the characters we know. The actors are miscast with little chemistry. Arnie spends a lot of dialogue explaining the movie almost like a narrator. The girl Sarah Connor doesn't come close to Linda Hamilton and the new Kyle Reese pales in comparison to Michael Biehn. The new Terminator technology was a waste of time because it didn't even seem as good as the liquid metal from T2. Of course everyone will go and see it, so numbers will look good, but this movie really isn't well thought out. It's like Total Recall's redo. Same props and lines. Arnie phoned this one in like he has been since he got old and after being Governator. I had high hopes dashed. Wait for DVD or download/PPV.",Terminator Genisys

It's well made, well thought out, and really quite enjoyable if you pay attention to what's happening and don't spend all your time fretting about reboots.I'm giving it 8/10 because it's entertaining and well made.

418,omega_work,An insult to James Cameron,1,1 February 2017,"I really wanted to like this (despite waiting for it to arrive on Netflix). But this was groan after groan. Opening with a completely cliché sequence which feels like the obligatory scene where we learn that Reese and John are buddies, in which Reese complains about all the killing he has to do... Killing? Does gunning down machines count as killing now? That is followed by a battle sequence that takes place over-top of a voice-over war speech John gives his troops ala Braveheart/every other war movie out there.I will admit that it is a cool concept to learn a little bit about the mechanics of how the time travel works, but it is a little lost when you are watching an entire battalion of soldiers staring awestruck at their naked companion.Once we bounce back to 1984 there is a lot of ""WTF""ery to get through as we see a crappy-looking CGI version of young Arnold re- enacting the original movie alongside actors who appear to have not seen the original - when suddenly, an aged Arnold arrives and picks a fight with himself.Meanwhile Reese is going through the motions of the original which are now suddenly interrupted by an Asian version of the T-1000, only to be rescued by that aged terminator alongside Sarah Connor.Breathe. Yes, by this point I was extremely confused as to what was happening. But Sarah tries to explain it, while addressing the aged Terminator as ""pops"" because clearly ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" taught the filmmakers nothing about pointing out how old our childhood heroes are getting. But before she can clear things up the T-1000 attacks and uses his liquid metal to revive the young Terminator - who for some reason attacks Reese instead of his actual target??What continually took me out of the movie was the fact that it is kind of a reboot, kind of a remake, kind of a sequel, so most of the cast made me question what I was watching - Emilia Clarke being the one exception; I actually bought her as Sarah.By a happy coincidence the heroes find themselves in a tunnel that has magical acid in the pipes... magical in that it melts the T1000's skeleton but not Arnold's.The next nice convenience is that with this altered time-line, Reese and Sarah can hop into the future - which just so happens to be our time, and Arnold can now look even closer to his actual age. Not contrived at all.With all of the confusion mounting up, the film seems to do it's best to either punch you in the face with action scenes or grind to a halt with boring scenes that explain nothing of the plot. Although we are constantly reminded that these two have to ""mate"", which on one hand was bold, but the fact that the actors have zero chemistry didn't help anything.So to add to the confusion, John makes an appearance in 2017 - apparently having travelled back from the future even though he was attacked when Reese left, and despite history being completely altered he still has scars on his face, but actually turns out to be a terminator in disguise, but not a normal terminator, a new kind that is also John at the same time. This mess is what I was busy trying to figure out while the movie wanted me to think about this Genysis thing which is like an IOS-artificial intelligence hybrid.So it turns out that the heroes have coincidentally landed exactly 24 hours before skynet becomes unstoppable, which of course makes one wonder why evil John helped them escape the police in the first place. But not to worry, rather than giving a sensible explanation we get treated to yet another fight scene.So while it is seemingly a Terminatorish thing to do, having the good guy suddenly now the bad guy, that goes down the drain when things happen like the following scene where we learn that John is attempting to make a time machine... the same type of time machine that Old Arnold managed to make-shift back in 1994 on his own. It seemed like they were also working on T-1000ish robots, which is kind of stupid seeing as the original model (Arnold) has not even been developed yet.At about this point in the film I was asking a zillion questions - like who turned John evil and why, and what their plan is? What is the good guys' agenda? and of course How much longer is this movie?But those questions were not be answered as it was more important to bore us. And now that Reese learns he is John's father we have the worst premise ever which is that two unlikeable characters know that they have to get together. On top of this, we have the situation that John now wants skynet to rule the world despite the fact that he (albeit in an alternate reality) is the leader of the resistance that fights them - making his motivations very bizarre.What follows is action scene after action scene, each one more boring than the last, until it crescendos in a monstrosity of ridiculousness, where somehow the time machine that the terminators were sent in now destroys them along with everything else in it's path - except Sarah and Reese of course.And the denouement is no better, with an upgraded Arnold reappearing, Sarah approaching young Reese to introduce him to his older self to tell himself something that is no longer relevant in this time-line. This movie is just.so.stupid. It's an insult to James Cameron.",Terminator Genisys

420,greg-e-porter,"If you go in with the right expectations, this new addition to the Terminator franchise is kinda fun and actually it warmed me up to the franchise as a whole.",5,31 August 2015,"If you've ever heard of Terminator you can probably guess the plot of Terminator: Genisys. In the late '90's or early '00's, A.I. was born - yadda yadda yadda - Mankind vs. Machines war. The machines discovered a way to time travel so they sent a robot wrapped in human skin back to kill the mother of the guy who saves Mankind from the war so he is never born. The guy's name is John Connor and his mother's name is Sarah. The humans followed suit and sent someone back to save her. That was the first Terminator.In the second one, the machines sent a liquid metal robot to kill John when he was just a kid. The third one was probably the same. The fourth movie in the franchise was set during the war against the machines, and that brings us to the latest film in the franchise.It seems like a bunch of movies this summer bank on nostalgia to draw in audiences and Terminator Genisys is no exception. The film's introduction uses fancy graphics to explain the premise of the series. There is a battle sequence while the humans take over the Machines' time machine and then they send Kyle Reese (Courtney) back in time. Reese's arrival in 1984 is a reenactment of the first film up until another liquid metal terminator reveals itself. Sarah Connor comes driving in and saves the would-be hero from the future.I can't really go into too much detail actually without giving away major plot points but the crux of the movie comes down to the fact that by sending people to the past, it actually changes the future.I suspect there are two reasons why people will see Terminator Genisys: Arnold and action. Arnold is getting older but the movie finds a way to work that in; the skin around the machine is human skin so it ages. Boom. Done. They also have a running line that's kind of endearing. ""Oldbut not obsolete!""The action is pretty standard. There are lots of explosions and characters are only injured when it is needed for the plot. They withstand car crashes and fist fights and explosions that would maim anyone else but when a random character shoots them in the leg, they're incapacitated.Much like the action, everything, be it the graphics, or the dialog, or the plot, is pretty standard. Normally I'd give this type of movie a 2/5 because it doesn't really do anything that other movies can't do better. The reason I decided on a two was because of the film's sense of humor. It's stuff like the 'old but not obsolete' line that makes this movie a fun, pleasant experience. After all, by this point in the franchise I shudder to imagine what it would look like if it took itself too seriously.",Terminator Genisys

This is a solid and engrossing movie. Okay, it borrows heavily from T2 but rehashes it in a very engaging way, in fact in a very overt and comedic way. No one will ever better T2 but this is a stellar attempt of which the director, Alan Taylor, should be very proud of. It was thrilling and also very funny at times. Yes, there were corny lines but I believe the director did this on purpose. If you're a critic and didn't like this film, I suggest you get out a lot more and stop pretending to people that you're somehow more aware of what's good and that you have a higher IQ than most. This was two hours well spent in my local cinema. People who gave this only one star are total clowns with their heads up their aspidistras! Special effects were brilliant, leaving me on the edge of my seat. The bus and helicopter scenes were amazingly well done. I saw many of the holes in the plot but I didn't give a hoot.

423,houghtonetet,Great to see Schwarzenegger back,8,11 July 2015,"Hollywood is becoming more and more comfortable with the idea of time-travel benefitting the movie industry. This latest re-writing of a franchise sees the admittedly welcome return of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the role that defined him, but the decidedly unwelcome scrapping of Judgment Day and all its consequences.One wonders if the real point to this time loop is simply to abandon the gloomy and depressing future illustrated by Terminator Salvation in favour of Arnie going on the rampage through California (again). Let's face it this is the entertainment industry and it is much easier on the eye and much more profitable to have the enormous screen presence of Schwarzenegger effortlessly carrying two hours of completely absurd and hugely enjoyable mayhem.So yes I can forgive the plot holes and the fractured time-lines and the complete re-writing of the entire point of all four of the previous movies in order to change Skynet's threat from nuclear annihilation to Lawnmower Man.Don't get me wrong – this is a slick, well-crafted movie that ticks all the boxes required for two hours of enjoyable nonsense and I felt my money was well spent. Schwarzenegger towered over the film as he always does; Emilia Clarke was bang-on as Sarah Connor. I would have liked to have seen more of JK Simmons' character, and I am not quite sure that Jai Courtney was right as Kyle Reese, but they are minor grumbles. The regret I have is Judgment Day has gone now and Skynet has a different face and is a different threat. There are questions to be answered by the sixth movie and doubtless more raised. I wonder how long it will be until Skynet begins sending T-800s and T-1000s back to the Middle Ages and earlier in order to wipe out Sarah Connor's ancestors? Hmm – let the screenwriters wrestle with that concept.Don't miss this film, it's worth a watch, but doesn't match the first two films. From now on I suppose none of them will.",Terminator Genisys

Some people want to say that this movie is trying to re-hash the original, they are missing the point. In a film about time-traveling terminators to kill of people in the past to change the future, would you not expect something like what we have here? The film leaves you with unanswered questions, but I believe its because they are planning for two sequels. I was entertained throughout the whole film. It was intense and action packed with great special effects and visuals. The acting was good (obviously not Academy Award worthy, but that's not the goal here). The story was great and kept your interest. The relationship between Sarah Conner and the Terminator was great and heartwarming, like that of John Conner and the Terminator in T2 - this added a great depth to the movie. There are some elements that don't quite add up, but work well enough that the rest of the movie serves as a good distraction and it doesn't bother you too much. All in all, great movie. People are too critical through comparing it to original works, especially when the originals were groundbreaking concepts for their time.

425,Lambysalamby,"Though flawed, it was better than I expected...",7,2 July 2015,"The new Terminator wasn't terrible! I'm surprised. Though it had its flaws it was much better then Terminator 3 and Salvation... and I actually enjoyed it mostly. I probably won't be watching it like 30 times like Judgement Day, but its not like I expected it to ever live up to Cameron's work....First off, the action was good and so was the pace, the film never became boring even with how complex the story was so it certainly gets points for that.The film itself runs like the greatest hits of the the franchise which is both good and bad. The pros: Revisiting 1984 (the first terminator timeline) was a lot of fun for obvious reasons.. You get more things like crazy manoeuvres from the T1000 etc and Arnie gets to kick some ass and even be funny at times....The cons: How many times do they have to repeat lines from the previous films? Sarah Conner says: ""Come with me if you want to live"" Really? Again? Really? Come on, having that as an obligatory line in each movie is actually annoying. ""I'll be back"" is just like an obligatory oh, we'll just squeeze that in there, the audience will love that! Nope, not really, see in the first Terminator that had impact! Like the impact of a car coming through the wall! This is there just for the sake of it...Aside from that, I think JK Simmons character was borderline pointless, you could nearly have cut him out of the movie and barely noticed! A crying shame for such an excellent actor.. Generally the script could have done with more tweaking, some plot towards the end just seemed outright silly, but I will say the chemistry between Arnie and Emilia was actually pretty good! Overall: It's no Judgement day but you know what, it was actually a decent film and it was great to see Arnie as the Terminator again, and not saying ""talk to the hand"" . I can see why James Cameron endorsed this as the true sequel to T2...",Terminator Genisys
426,scoobydoo-29055,Please make another !,10,9 August 2015,Been a fan off every single one of Arnold's movies. Yes even twins. But he is always spot on with the terminator franchise. We were so into this one we didn't want it to end. That's how a movie is supposed to be. There were plenty of twists and turns. Acting was great. Cgi was great. I can't make 1 complaint about it. It's coming to red box soon so spend the $1.00 and change and have a go with it. Perfect movie for a Friday night at home with popcorn and Chinese food. If it's still in the theater in some locations where you live pay to see it in 3D. I watched MI rouge nation this weekend also. Terminator blows it out of the water. Both are supposed to be action packed. Terminator is a 9 in action. MI is a 2. No disappointments. I hope they somehow find a way to make another one. I would hate to have the terminator series just end. This one was as good as T2. Part 1 will always be my favorite but this one is up there in top 10 action sci fi flicks :D,Terminator Genisys
427,missmomosa,Loved This Movie!,8,28 July 2015,"I won't really put any spoilers but I put that just in case.I loved this movie. Let's get right to it, the cons of this movie are little so I'll start there. The acting; Arnold is Arnold if you go in expecting an Oscar worthy performance from him then shame on you. He is good because he does what he does and it works. . .for him. I usually adore Jai Courtney (Reese) in films but he was kind of stale here. He delivered his lines a bit uncomfortably which he is better than that (to me), Emilia Clark (Sarah Connor) did a great job as a young Sarah Connor. Her facial expressions were on point and she really took the role and made it her own.Aside from Jai Courtney that would be the only cons I have and he wasn't a big con. The story of Skynet in this is so modern that it scared me. How true with how we are today!! Movies that paint a picture of society and it's obsession with technology (nothing painted it better than Surrogates w/ Bruce Willis) is eerie but truthful.The action was great. The T-1000's were pretty cool and the storyline and how it took a really different past, current, and future spin was not really new but very fresh in it's delivery. My favorite in this film was Jason Clarke (Connor) what a performance he gave. He owned up to the role and really made it different but the same. The end vision for Skynet was refreshing that it kind of gave Terminator a reboot feel - the premise is the same but the outcome changed, slightly.Overall, I felt very satisfied with this story. There were some down moments but they were needed to balance out the action in the film and to ease us into the storyline. I'd love to see another one with this cast to see where they can take it. If you are a terminator fan then go see this for yourself. You as a T-Fan know what expectations to have going into it, it's a pleasure to watch and much ""happier"" than the dim reboot with Christian Bale.",Terminator Genisys

One of the most original stories you could put into a movie let alone the 5th movie of a franchise.

I won't give any plot away but if you go see this without any knowledge of the story you will be shocked and surprised and pleasantly entertained.

429,jacques77,Cons aside – this is actually a very good addition to the series,5,15 November 2015,"Let's honestly put our bias aside and look at this film not from a Terminator 1 fan or a franchise or comicon fan. Without a doubt, the producers remained true to the franchise – much more so than they did in Terminator Salvation and this instalment is a very creative tie up and, I hope, ending to the saga. Being the fifth instalment, things could have gone way bad by now with really bad production values, ridiculous scripts and inappropriately cheesy lines. Instead Genisys stays true to the essence of the franchise, considers its cheesy moments very carefully (I still here Pops saying ""I might be older, but I am not obsolete"") and gave us a really good tie up of events – even if the base idea was stolen from the Star Trek reboot. Let's compare it to many other franchises like Batman and Superman and Alien, which by movie 4 really went off the rails – not even Uma Thurman could save that script... A lot of reviews complain about Salvation (which I also did not enjoy either) and Genysis (which I though was a good recover). The film is filled with Easter Eggs of moments referencing other popular Arnold Schwarzenegger movies as well as the original three films. And to be honestthis is Terminator we are talking about – we are not expecting the Bond flick. So the fact that the film is flawed from a critical point and often does not cover its own continuity aside – it does stick to the reality it created and the time-space discrepancies are easily forgiven. All in all it is well worth the money I spent on the movie and the popcorn, for the awesome use of effects, revisiting old favourite moments from the series and a story that actually is not that bad – come one, I can hear someone saying that it was a weak storyline.but I repeatthis is Terminator we are talking about",Terminator Genisys

If you like the film, you should be banned from voting and sent for re-education. Is there anything Hollywood won't do these days in their insane lust for money? And, more importantly, is there any redemption for IMDb's rating system? I think not. Rating systems such as this one work on the basis that the reviewer is intelligent and/or logical. Well, forget it. If you liked this film, I beg of you, seek mental help. We can't go on tolerating this absolutely disgusting greed at the expense of art. Stop going to the cinema in the first place. Although this crap-heap still managed to find a way to annoy me, at least I didn't contribute to the wallets of the awful people who slapped the abomination together.As an aside, I gave Terminator 1 and 2 a ten-on-ten rating. Very few films get that rating from me. Everything that came after them is a dismal, blatant, pathetic cash-in. Hollywood is just laughing at the sheep among us.",Terminator Genisys
431,YaumingYMC,Acceptable fun,7,23 July 2015,"I liked the movie. There were a lot of humorous moments. The movie was well paced. Everything flowed pretty well. The acting was pretty good. And it was really enjoyable to see Arnie play Terminator Pops to Sarah. OK there was logical ""inconsistancies"" - which will really spoil the movie if you think too much about it. But it doesn't get in the way very much unless you focus on it like a Literature major.One thing bothered me - I question the casting choice for Reese. The actor who plays him - also played Spartacus Roman gladiator friend. Don't get me wrong - he's a good actor - but not someone I imagined who Reese would be - more dynamic, more alpha. Pity the original starz spartacus star is dead - he would have been an excellent choice.Overall it was pretty good - but it was like one of those forgettable B grade movies - the whole plot involves them blowing up Skynet. Wasn't that done before in t3 and it didn't work due to networking? Plus Skynet was more advanced thanks to John Connor Mk2 going back in time to upgrade things. Anyway - don't think too much about it - its not Shakespeare. Its good to see Arnie back as the friendly neighbourhood Terminator.",Terminator Genisys
432,robhigg2203,"Full of great nods to the original, tons of surprises and while far from the best of the series is still a awesome movie",9,12 July 2015,"Four movies and more than 30 years after the original movie came out, you would think you would know the formula it would follow. OK so Salvation which to be honest I did enjoy even if it was for the wrong reasons, was different from the others and probably wasn't gonna have the same impact. But this is pretty much the game changer. The idea that I had going in was that they were disregarding 3 and 4 and while that is definitely the case I think you can throw the second one in there two cause there too. The events of the first film or at least how they should have occurred play a much bigger part this time round.So at first the film feels more like a prequel to the first film and gradually leading up to the half prequel half remake direction Rob Zombie took in his first Halloween movie. There are plenty of nods to the original and even includes/ reuses footage of the original when the T- 800 first arrives. These parts were enough to get me excited at first, but this still does change soon, the big twists that make this the big game changer of the series come into play early on. I would say the fact that it does defy expectations to the point you no longer know what to expect is what kept me engaged in the movie the most. You don't know what is really going on, while I can't really say it keeps you guessing it does keep you wondering where could they take this next. As a fan of the series there was no denying that a big plus for this movie was to see Arnie return. There are some self aware moments in the movie nodding that anyone who would go in thinking he was too old to do another Terminator (or I guess another action film altogether) and he does pull the action scenes off. A downside is though as he was sent further back in time than he had been in the other movies this Terminator was somewhat more adjusted and become other of a robotic father figure. But there lies some brief annoying parts for me at least, while Emila Clarke (looking extremely different from her Game of Thrones character) still almost manages to be as kick ass as Linda Hamilton's portrayal in Terminator 2 in this alternate timeline version she has some parts where she comes across more like a annoying teenager. While this doesn't happen too much thankfully it does establish that long and meaningful relationship had been formed between the two. But as far as rebooting the series goes, this does take place after the original definitely but like I said at the start the second movie is also almost forgotten about. The relationship to this Sarah Connor shows signs of what could have been if the T-800 had survived the second film and was there to see John Connor grow up and while references would not have seemed necessary for the parts where it might have seemed relevant for the most part there was only one major element towards the end that would suggested Terminator 2: Judgement Day still occurred.The element that does suggest Terminator 2: Judgement Day happened lies in were it explains what ultimately caused the Judgement Day event itself. The idea layed down in Rise of the Machines that it was always going to happen and that the events of the second movie was only going to delay it still play a big role here. I liked how it portrays how modern technology has taken over people lives, over reliance on Smartphones, tablets and especially the cloud does become a theme. I am someone who loves technology and having such gadgets but at the same time this made me glad I try to keep some activities old fashioned (I.e doing this like buying the CD as opposed to downloading of iTunes as much as possible). Looking back on it, it now seems hard to imagine how Judgement Day might have been caused at the time the first two film where made, the internet was around in some form but the World Wide Web was not around until 3 years after the second movie was made.This movie is still filled with great actions scenes and effects, once it establishes the world of the first film no longer exists they really up the scale of the action. They found a great double to use for this film when the T-800 as we first saw in 1984 really helped build the excitement for when the main T-800 seen throughout the movie appears and takes on his original self. The effects looked amazing throughout, they were moments where the impact they made really made me glad that I saw this movie in 3D. Plus while still disregarding the events of the last two sequels there were elements or themes while brief (and not completely revelant) from those movies that are present. (Won't elaborate more to avoid spoiling what the trailers have done already) Plus heads up for any fellow Doctor Who fans Matt Smith is barely in it, but leads to a big twists in the plot thats for sure.It is bound to annoy a lot of the fans of the series, I can not deny that is a strong possibility, the most skeptical of those who have not seen this yet reading this I would say keep a open mind. There are some fan service moments to enjoy and I know I got a kick out of seeing but could still seem cheesy for others. But nonetheless this was a awesome outing for the series, it leaves you wanting more but even if these other films don't get made this still makes for a great ending to the series. 9/10",Terminator Genisys
433,austinfromdahood,A disgrace to the Terminator Franchise,2,19 February 2019,"When I was younger, I was a huge Terminator fan. I watched all of the movies and even though some of them weren't as good as others, I still enjoyed them. And I was really pumped when I heard that a new Terminator movie was coming out. I watched Terminator Genisys when I was about 12, and I liked it at the time. I just watched it recently, and I thought to myself, ""What was wrong with me back then, why did I like this movie!?""As you can tell, I really didn't like this movie. It was a hair's length away from being awful. Let's start with the cons, and there's a lot of them. The movie has a terrible script, and that's probably the worst part about it. It's so predictable, and every time they try to spice it up, it doesn't seem like a surprise because I can see it from a mile away. The acting is dull, especially from Jai Courtney and Emilia Clarke. The action sequences are not very impressive. This movie feels like it copies from a bunch of good action movies and combines it into one big mess. This movie also recycles concepts from other Terminator movies, and it doesn't feel like its own thing.It has been announced that a new Terminator movie is coming out that completely ignores all the Terminator movies after Judgement Day, and I was really pleased with that. I hope that movie will be good, I really do. James Cameron is producing and writing that movie, and I really like that move. The only small redeeming part about Terminator Genisys is Arnold Schwarzenegger, and I guess it was fun to see him again as the terminator. This movie is a disgrace to the Terminator franchise, and I'd give it a 2/10",Terminator Genisys
434,gtylerpayne,Awesome movie with some flaws,8,18 November 2015,"It's crazy to me how harsh some of these reviews are. How can you really HATE this movie? It's pretty awesome, in my opinion.Let's face it, people. It's a Terminator movie dealing with time travel. It's not going to make a whole lot of sense. Most of the negative reviews I read heavily criticized things that didn't make sense in the plot regarding the science or time travel. I really think you need to be able to overlook and not-over analyze most of these things to enjoy a movie like this.If you can just sit back and enjoy the ride, I think most people will find this movie to be great.I read that the marketing campaign gave away most of the plot twists and that the director was really upset about it. Personally, I don'y watch TV, so I had not seen any of the trailers. I was completely surprised by the big twist regarding John Connor, and really though it was an awesome moment in the movie.It didn't bother me upon watching the film, but the one thing pointed out in other reviews that does seem a bit silly in retrospect, is the fact that they are so eager to travel to the FUTURE to stop genisys, and they travel to the very last minute to give themselves just enough time. I see how this is somewhat necessary to make the film more intense, but it is really ridiculous that they wouldn't just wait it out so that they could have more time and be more prepared, or at least give themselves some leeway and travel to 2016 instead of 2017. The main reason I'm giving this movie 8 stars instead of 9 is the casting. I don't think that a movie like this could really hope to deserve a 10 rating, because it's made to be mindless blockbuster entertainment, but with the right casting, I think it could have lived up to T1 and T2 a little more closely. Emilia Clarke does not have the intensity or drive needed to really pull off the character. She's not terrible, but a little too cute and adorable. Jai Courtney didn't bother me much but I do agree that he somewhat lacks charisma. He would actually make a good terminator.Overall, I would say that if you like action movies and sci-fi, go into this not expecting much, and you will have a good time.",Terminator Genisys
435,Safcinexile,Dumm Dumm Dumm Dee Dumm.... He's back!,8,4 July 2015,"After a couple rough bumps The Terminator franchise is back on track!Starts of quite well, quite like the way they managed to film scenes from the original, getting the look & feel of certain scenes down (I am sure one of the Punk Hoods even looked like Bill Paxton), then it hits full speed when the time line splits. Although I did feel like it ran out of steam halfway through the movie, but it managed pick up the pace again for the climatic showdown. Emilia Clarke was very good, you could be forgiven if it looked like she had studied Linda Hamilton's performance, as you could see some of her in it, but she was able take the role and make it her own, someone carrying the burden of a unwanted future role that she has been told that she has no choice to follow.Jai Courtney managed to improve on Michael Biehn's performance and give Reece a more fleshed out performance.As for Arnold, well what can I say, there is probably nobody else who can pull off an ageing T-800 any better, probably a role that he will always be destined for. He actually made me chuckle in a couple of scenes.Safe to say that The Terminator franchise is back on track and in safe hands. Judging by the post-credit scene..... They'll be back Dun Dumm Dun Dee Dumm......",Terminator Genisys
436,nagyistvanandor,Good but not quit there,6,5 July 2015,"I think the main difference between T1 and T2 compared to T3 and T4. Is: while the first two movies wanted to tell a story. the later movies are focus group driven cash in on the fan base. Its kinda f-ed up when your major thought about a product, that its not as horrible as the previous two. Yay, i guess. :}its fair to assume the story was put together with a list ""fans probably wants to see this"" mixed with undeveloped ideas, and not much else linking the final result. Its a tight checklist to run down, without room for the story or characters to breath. Without stakes or surprises (specially since the trailer spoiled most of the possible surprises.) There is not one scene where i was at least concern for any of the main players life. I liked the guardian Terminator a lot, maybe even to the point that this was the most like able terminator of all 5 movies. Even though i hate the constant reminders of Arnie is old, Arnie is old. Yes we can see that, don't rub it in our nose. The effects of the terminator fighting the same model, the ages its goes through are flawless. Its good that they brought back Sarah Conor, but did it have to be Emilia Clarke? I did not buyed her as Sarah Conor or as a fighter or as a character. She should go back to showing her butt, eating bloody hearts and doing whatever for a grasp of fame on game of thrones. Not that Jai Courtney was any better. I wonder if John Conor would have worked better if the trailer and posters would have not spoiled the fact that his the evil terminator in the movie. It was a interesting idea, but beside hey now his a evil robot, it did not really went anywhere. He was a slightly different from t-1000 or tx. Its better than the parody which was t3. Its better than the giant miss-focused fan fiction staring a savior we did not asked for, and sometimes featuring characters we actually wanted to see as cameos, which was t4. But that is not really enough, is it? Leave your brain outside the cinema and you will have a fun time with not lasting impact.

437,whermantodd,"I agree with Jonfreid, and personally the story twists",10,7 July 2015,"Been following the saga since the start including t.v. series till no more. Lena, Sarah Conner, t.v., was also king's wife in 300 those who pay attention.To the addition of Jonfreid critique, the flow of story was great as the first Terminator in taking us to why Pandora's box, Skynet, sought to go past to kill Sarah. Sgt. Reese knows she dies, humans out of machine run world. Pandora's box loses hope. You ever took course in Greek myth, and know why word myth used for people who cannot cope with truths of ancient past the world was, you know why I am using. Same as those with rejection of Maha Bahrata account of Thera in Atlantis 11,000 years ago, because past/present alleged scholars want to dismiss ancient people knew our same and greater, from not coping that truth. Truth like anti gravity if you know where Tesla was going to take us next.Same Terminator saga is in showing story idea that time displacing would be to our 2015, if something as this were happening and, Gov. agency did the usual ""cover"" to keep from public as this saga has portrayed from start. Why do we hear people proclaimed crazy because peculiar event takes place but the perceptive are not there to deal, just daily folks routine lives. The two detectives scene showed this well. Watch for it.Arnold did his usual funny with machine smile regular human might get attention too looking psychotic, a terminator not made to pass for. The humor he was given to show was its own. That it is explained he was sent back to Sarah's childhood this time shows Skynet fury to change past. Logical network learns emotional reaction in not ridding humans? We can take this back to 1968 HALL 9000, 1970 Colossus, the Forbin Project story. Even tells humans they will learn to love it. Skynet showing it learn to hate losing to humans.All this because science does not mean wisdom. Today means ridiculously expensive contracts and messing with earth/nature some news reports get to show terrible effects.

438,iseeeliteinthesky,Dreadful destruction of Terminator franchise,1,21 November 2015,"This movie is worse than low-budget TV-production. OK there was no original idea in this movie. They couldn't continue Terminator after Terminator 2, so they had to invent new idiotic ways to force the franchise to go on. And the idiotic events just turn more idiotic as time progresses.I strongly wonder how on earth did this movie get a rating of present 6.7/10? The correct rating is 5 at maximum. For fans the correct rating of this movie is zero.It starts with CGI and some fights, here we once again need explanation of what happened, a revamped identical start of Terminator 2. After we are thrown in a predictable scene where a terminator almost kills a boy.Next up, a CGI future battle between survivors and machines, here its still not really that bad, they picked a great man to be John Connor, even though he looks nothing like what he did in Terminator 2.Nothing is in line with Terminator 1 (T1) or Terminator 2 (T2) movies. The future-surviving people of Terminator 1 was clearly living in terrible conditions. In this garbage they altered it and all are well fed, anabolic super trained, carry heavy armor and have this ""cool American cowboy attitude"" that most people view as imbecile. Its like Idiocracy, humans get more idiotic as time progress it seems by this movie. Then we are shown a revamped start of T1, its like this movie is trying to incorporate the awesomeness of T1 and T2 by just copying their starts? It doesn't work, its like inventing the wheel multiple times. Then a horrid CGI battle.Next there is a battle with T1000, highly predictable, does mostly the same moves as he did in T2, trying to jump into a van etc. No original ideas yet then of course the whole confusion thing where the T1000 mimics a copy of T2 again, brain dead Sarah Connor shoots one of the duplicates in the foot and this happens to be the T1000 that's get the shot, then she brags over this intelligent action taken. Horrid. Women are encouraged to be assholes. In comparison one can view the quality of T1 plot and acting where Sarah Connor was not brain dead and just rethink how bad this script really is. Emilia Clarke was a great Dragon Queen but she is not Sarah Connor, definitely not. Most likely picked for her good looks and descent body.",Terminator Genisys
439,felix-wyderka,An entertaining movie with a few obvious minor flaws,6,4 September 2015,"I really liked the first three Terminator movies, but this one didn't really convince me if it was such a good idea to make a new one. I thought it was OK, but there were a bit too many dialogues and too little action. Also, all the time we hear that John Connor is going to defeat Skynet and in the end he becomes it and gets killed. So all the movies before are basically wrong. Another thing is that since Skynet is destroyed, the franchise must be over. I really liked the mix up of the story line, because for a change, Sarah Connor knows what's going on, which gave the makers an opportunity to create a different story. However, it was really nice to see Emilia Clarke in a different role for a change. All in all I think the movie was alright and entertaining but not as good as the first three movies of the franchise.",Terminator Genisys
440,dioditto,"A High Speed Bullet Train Wreck, with Big Explosions",2,9 July 2015,"This movie doesn't make sense. The plot is incomprehensible, even to the movie directors who tried to explain it through Arnold with confused scientific baloney. The jumping back and forth in time also doesn't make any sense at all as it serves no purpose.And I think the director didn't expect people to understand it (nor does he himself understand it) - as the movie just speed along like a high speed bullet train wreck from one explosion to another, it is practically non-stop. For those who just want to watch nonsensical explosions and fight scenes, this movie is it.This movie is more like a homage to the first two original terminator movies - scenes from the original terminator are recreated completely frame by frame, even 1984 young Arnold looks incredibly realistic. There is no doubt the CG are done realistically, but the framing of each CG scene such as the nuclear detenonations are done kind of poorly, it lacks the grandeur and doom feeling of the original.Acting and casting are passable, with Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor being the stand out - performance wise she brings a lot to the screen presence, and you can't help to see her resemblance to Linda Hamilton, except Emily Clark looks like a 14 year old due to her incredibly young look and short stature which ruins the suspension of disbelief. Overall, a complete train wreck, even for those who love the Terminator franchise.",Terminator Genisys
441,t-hf,Actually very good. A legitimately decent Terminator sequel.,7,5 July 2015,"So, Terminator: Genisys is finally upon us and I can sum it up in one sentence: not quite as good as the first two movies, but so much better than the dismal Terminator: Salvation. I would ignore the critics on this one, because Genisys is actually a very good terminator sequel and an all round good action flick, albeit with some inevitable flaws.First off, it's great to see Arnie back. He still has an enormous amount of charisma and is still badass as the iconic T-800. The fan- service is also great, and I personally found it very entertaining to see some of my favourite terminator moments re-enacted (a common complaint amongst some). I also love the new cast. I would have been disappointed if merely pale imitations of the original characters had been cast, but Emilia Clarke, Jai Courtney and Jason Clarke are great as the principal human characters that we've grown to love and all bring a new interpretation to their respective characters. At this point, John Connor is more or a messianic figure than a person and is open to interpretation. In this aspect, I think that Jason Clarke did a very good job and seemed the portray the John Connor that has fully grown into a strong and capable leader very well. When it comes to plot, I would say that the film's story is more focused on Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor's complex relationship than it is on the Terminator so be prepared for for Arnie to be sidelined on a few occasions. I won't spoil anything crucial, but I personally found the paradoxical time travel in this film more interesting and explored than it was in T1 or T2. You have no doubt heard that the narrative is re- writing the original films' timelines, and if you are a mega-massive- super fan of the Terminator franchise, you may find this bothers you, but personally I found it added an interesting layer to the already established timeline and opens up some very interesting questions to keep you guessing. For instance, how can Kyle and Sarah grow closer and conceive John if she is already so independent? How will their relationship develop from there?Overall, the film is very enjoyable for both longtime fans and newcomers that want to get into the franchise. I think that it definitely recreates the tone from the first two movies and is actually fun for once, even Judgement Day looks exciting and unique like the original (unlike the boring, gritty and generic wasteland that was Terminator: Salvation). With some great performances and exciting action set pieces, Terminator: Genisys is definitely a stand out of the summer.",Terminator Genisys
442,vincent-malisse,The same yet different.,7,14 July 2015,"Starting the movie you would think you're in for an empty story, CGI packed action flick featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Emilia Clarke. In the first minutes I was even thinking it was a remake of the original 1984 version, but much to my surprise a first twist of the storyline pops up and you know you're in for something different.The story is much slower though and the basic concept (heroes need to stop judgment day from happening by destroying something so Skynet cannot develop) is still kept, though a little more complex now that time lines are being mixed.As one might expect, the story was filled with hints for even more movies and the time travel concept is, as is with most time travel movies, full of holes. (time travel is also mindbogglingly complex)I suspect that moving judgment day from 1997 to 2017 has to do with trying to take in the younger viewers among us which you can also tell by the use of iPads/phones/... Arnie still holds his own in the movie and ties the story together, whereas the other characters (John and Sarah Conner, Kyle Reese,...) seem somewhat out of place, which is a pity as this had nothing to do with their acting ability.If you haven't seen it yet, expect much the same, but also many new elements. All in all an entertaining movie, but also nothing more than that.He'll (probably) be back.",Terminator Genisys
443,willhaskew,An average film,5,2 September 2015,"So everyone was probably excited when they heard Schwarzenegger was coming back to this franchise. But it can be assumed that the makers of this film didn't learn from the failures of the last 2 movies-Rise of the Machines and Salvation. Rise of the Machines was a disappointment due to the casting choices of Nick Stahl (who the hell thought he was John Connor material) and Claire Daines (a whiny dope who looks like she'd cry over a broken heel). Salvation was set in the near-future Los Angeles during the War Against the Machines but it had a bad script and if your were like me, your were hoping to see, I don't know, the HUMANS WIN THE WAR AGAINST THE MACHINES. This film opening has the humans capturing the original time machine and destroying the command center for Skynet's defenses and soldiers, so war won, right? Not so fast, the T-800 has already gone back to kill Sarah Connor in 1984 but Kyle Reese volunteers to travel back to save her. As he's traveling back, Kyle sees the John and the Resistance attacked from behind and a warning vision from his childhood in 2017 pre-war Los Angeles. The original T-800 arrives in 1984 Los Angeles but is quickly dispatched by another Terminator referred to as the Guardian and Sarah Connor. Connor was rescued in the mid-1970's from another attack by this Guardian and she refers to him as Pops since he also raised her in the aftermath. Kyle Reese arrives in time to be attacked by a T-1000 and is rescued by Sarah and Pops the Guardian. They explain their knowledge of the war and events of Judgement Day. Their intention is to travel to 1997 with a scavenged time machine in order to prevent the original timeline's nuclear attacks and destroy Skynet. Kyle is convinced by the clearer recollection of his childhood memory that the timeline has changed and convinces Sarah to travel to 2017 while Pops the Guardian waits for them. They arrive in 2017, finding the majority of the human population waiting for the release of ""Genisys"" a new operating system for mobile devices and computers which is Skynet in disguise. Reese recognizes an apparently unharmed John Connor and introduces him to Sarah but it quickly becomes clear that John was changed. John was injected with nanotech, turning him into a shape-shifting cyborg, the T-5000. He's also orchestrating the final delivery of Skynet to the machines and infrastructure of the world.The good is that Arnie gives a really good performance as Pops the Guardian. His homicidal looking grin gets old quickly though. The visuals are very impressive since Legacy Effects, a studio special effects legend Stan Winston founded, oversaw all the CGI, animatronics, prosthetics and other special effects. Looking great doesn't help with the story. Reaching hard for something amidst the wreckage of multiple timelines, reboots, and other story elements makes a mess of the plot. Time travel is a much abused plot device and is like the magical cure for cancer when it comes to ending wars or averting disasters by this film's logic. It sounded a lot scarier when Skynet was originally described as a military AI designed for missile defense that becomes self-aware and destroys much of humanity. Now it's just a malignant version of Windows or iOS. Emilia Clarke looks lost in this as well. You know she's trying hard but it just doesn't work. Jai Courtney is almost as boring playing John Connor but he it doesn't seem like playing a tough guy is as much of a stretch for him compared to her. The action is great but this doesn't stand up to the original two films but does better the last two attempts. Finally, John Connor as the main villain seems like a betrayal of something essential from the original plot. It makes me a little angry and seems unnecessary for him to become the Terminator's equivalent of Darth Vader.",Terminator Genisys

445,tymbus,Terminator: Revylation.,6,11 July 2017,"If I had a time machine I'd go back and stop myself reading the bad reviews of Terminator: Genisys. The movie is an acceptable action romp largely let down by the quest for a young audience. This probably accounts for the lack of menace, although nothing can explain the tired reworking of set pieces reminiscent of scenes in films made over a decade ago.The plot sees Kyle Reese send back in time to protect Sarah Conner from a Terminator send back by Skynet to destroy her. So far, so familiar. But just as Reese his sent back, he witnesses John Conner (who you may recall is Reese son) being grabbed by an agent acting on Skynet's behalf. One result is a whole new future is created, one in which Skynet has disguised itself as a multi-platform 'killer app' . Science fiction fans will easily cope with such space-time shenanigans although perennial questions that dog such tropes remain. For example, if you knew the exact date a lethal computer programme would come on line would you choose to arrive years earlier or wait to the very last moment. I mean, nothing can go wrong with the latter plan can it...?The film's opening act provides the most fun for Terminator fans as Arnie gets to fight his younger self and the T-1000. Nostalgic violence ensues as scenes from the earlier movies are recreated and expanded. There's also an awesome recreation of Judgement Day. Science Fiction/Disaster movies set in San Francisco can be divided into two types: ones that destroy the Golden Gate Bridge at the start and ones that destroy the Golden Gate Bridge at the end. This film does both.The casting is a bit odd, particularly Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese. In the first Terminator movie, the role of Reese was cast to contrast with Schwarzenegger's physique. Michael Biehn was bugged out and wiry. Here, Courtney looks like a young Schwarzenegger. This has to be intentional and was maybe done to remind audiences of Schwarzenegger's youthful persona - now aged and grey haired and nicknamed 'pops' (credits list him as the Guardian not even as a terminator). Jason Clarke has what might politely be called a distinctive appearance and looks more comfortable as a business executive than leader of Earth's resistance against the machine. Matt Smith gives appropriately smarmy life to the anthropomorphised Genisys operating systemBack in the day, I think a lot of fans felt Terminator was 'their' discovery. I know I did. The film was a low budget affair. Director James Cameron was a relative unknown and, despite box-office success as Conan the Barbarian, Schwarzenegger had yet to cement his position as the mega-star he would become. It seems that the Cameron- Schwarzenegger pairing is what fans really want. Personally, I loved a lot of Terminator 3, but audiences rejected it as they've rejected this movie.Forbes on-line has listed negative reviews as a key reason for the film's box-office flop but I'd like to add lack of imagination to the mix. There's a stunt involving the characters trapped in a school bus that is only a slight reworking of a scene in Jurassic Park: The Lost World, except there a trailer is dangling off a cliff and menaced by dinosaurs which, as it turns out, audiences are much keener to see than homicidal cyborgs on the loose.",Terminator Genisys
446,supergye,I Judge The',7,4 July 2015,"Spoilers abound be warned: The movie goes over much of the same material that the other Terminator movies made famous. It is another alternate timeline and in this one the T-101 Terminator came in when Sarah was 9 yrs old, not as a teenager. The unending action, and new John Connor nanite hybrid human-machine with this minor plot twist make the movie much more palatable.The acting by Emilia Clark, who plays Sarah Connor was fine. She wasn't as dramatic and dark compared to Linda Hamilton. This current Sarah was forewarned of the danger, and comes combat ready.Arnold is a more mature Terminator warmed with a bit of humorous human mannerisms learned after many years protecting the future leader's mother Sarah Connor. The one thing with the casting of Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese. Although a fine actor, he comes in as a buff well nourished dude; who looks like he spent 3-4 days a week in a weight room working 2-3 hours/per workout. How this is possible when the future resistance group was always portrayed as a rag tag underground group? Always on the run, not knowing what lies around the next corner. Yes, there may be a possibility that these guys have the time to workout heavily, but it just makes it look like the resistance group has allot of free time on their hands. Also, the emotional contrasts, anxiety, are not as great played by a muscled jock compared to the original Kyle Reese played by a lean average Joe build, Michael Biehn. It just seemed like Courtney was always going to come out OK in a fight, and that he just wasn't all that worked up about the death and destruction about, albeit for the beginning when he was in the clothing store.My great love for these characters, along with the fun drive this franchise has managed to let one ride along on gives this movie a comfortable thumbs up. Genisys definitely is not the strongest of the bunch story wise, but manages on enough levels to be ""entertaining"" (great CGI), and that's all I can ask for. That is all I ever ask for.",Terminator Genisys
447,dikaea,Terminated by lethal stupidity....,5,29 September 2015,"Really was looking forward to seeing the movie as I am a huge fan of the series.So I watched is last night. Oh my dear lord! The franchise suffered the most cruel, soul crashing, life ending blow it could possibly get!The plot was horrendous and a straight up barbaric mutilation of the original story. The directing and overall mood was of a kindergarten school play. Sarah and Kyle characters were bubblegum obnoxious caricatures of the almighty and brilliant ones miss Hamilton and Mr Biehn, brought to life for us to love, admire and adore.The only good thing in the movie was Arni who tried to save the unsalvageable.T3 and Salvation are masterpieces in comparison to this mess of a mess.",Terminator Genisys
448,edenney01,Highly recommend for Terminator fans,8,4 July 2015,"If you're a Terminator fan and enjoyed Terminator 2: Judgement Day, then it's hard to imagine you not liking this movie. It was very well written, with a great script and story, and the visual effects are what you'd expect from a modern Terminator movie. There are a lot of unexpected twists and turns that will keep even the most astute viewers unsure of what's going to happen next. Arnold unquestionably steals the show and brings a LOT of laughs in his role as ""Pops"" (aka The Guardian), and the script did a good job of accounting for his multiple age difference(s) in this movie. Like they did in Salvation, there are countless homages paid to previous Terminator movies throughout Genisys. So much so that it gets to be a ridiculously obvious what the director was doing. Almost every significant scene from the first two movies plays out again in some fashion in Genisys... you name, it they snuck it in (literally at least 30-50 subtle and not-so-subtle homages). About the only thing missing was GNR playing ""You Could Be Mine"", and the classic ""*f**k you a**hole"" from the original movie"". I suspect the PG-13 rating was the only reason the latter was left out, and was instead replaced by a few ""Bite me""s. While there have been some seriously questionable casting choices in the previous Terminator movies, and it's difficult to keep adjusting to new actors in nearly all of the major roles, the casting choices in Genisys were almost all very good. Emilia Clarke does an outstanding job as a young (and sexy) Sarah Connor, and her eyes/facial features look so much like a young Linda Hamilton that it made me curious whether they were related. The other casting choices are almost all good as well, except for John Connor. I hated him about as much as I hated the casting choice for John Connor in T3, which is to say a LOT. I fail to understand why they always seem to make at least one or two really horrible casting choices in the Terminator movies. Kyle Reese and his stupid little sidekick in Salvation top my list or extremely irritating casting choices.To sum up, this movie will absolutely find a home in my collection as soon as it's available, and I highly recommend you see it in the theater if you enjoyed the first two Terminator movies. Two thumbs up!",Terminator Genisys
449,Sky_Flowersoul,Terminator Genisys,4,22 September 2019,"For me, the second part of the Terminator is the standard of the fantasy genre. I have never seen anything better in my life. And every time a new part of the Terminator comes out, I try it on the second one way or another.So this time I kept an eye on - but why is the Genesis better than Doomsday? Nothing, absolutely. But worse in almost everything.So, about all the shortcomings in order:1) It's been 20 years, and primitive special effects are used. The second part was cooler!
2) Almost the entire film was shot in dark (almost black) colors. To see something, sometimes you need to strain your eyesight.
3) A completely non-captivating plot. Everything is so primitive and uninteresting that you look at the time when this nonsense will end.
4) The number of abstruse philosophical conversations exceeds all possible limits. 2 minutes of some senseless pursuit and then 20 minutes of the same meaningless gundezh - and so on in a circle.",Terminator Genisys
450,toonarly,Great final film for the franchise,10,1 October 2015,"I enjoyed this installment quite a lot. It was intelligently written, fit in the plot of the entire franchise of movies. Tied everything up nicely. Has great actors playing the key parts. Arnold is perfect in his role as an aging terminator. Storyline flows well with lots of action and clips as well as some good humorous parts and memorable dialog from earlier films. I found it fun, refreshing, exciting, action packed and just plain well done. Rare that a franchise does better as the episodes (movies) go beyond the third sequel. But this being the fifth is well worth the effort. This film is not the first one or second one, it's the fifth, so all you critics just try and enjoy it for what it is, terminator 5. Go see it you not be disappointed.",Terminator Genisys
451,IanAJohnson,This film was too convoluted and poorly written,5,10 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys is the fifth installment in the Terminator franchise. This one attempts to spice up the timeline by placing two more terminators far enough back in time to interfere with the events of the first film. I am going to come straight out and say that this is not a terrible film, but it is a terrible Terminator film. The first thing that bothered me was the casting. Not a single actor that portrayed a franchise character (other than Arnold Schwarzenegger of course) felt like the character they were supposed to be playing. The acting wasn't bad; it was just off. Not only is that off-putting, but this by far the most convoluted plot in the franchise. One of the subtle beauties of the previous films is that while time travel is involved, each film takes place chronologically after its predecessor. Skynet tries to kill John Connor's mother, then John as a child, then it runs into him as an adult. This might not seem like much but it keeps the time travel incredibly simple and vague. There was no way for the audience to determine whether or not it is possible to change the future in the long-term (a major philosophical question that the franchise asks the audience). This film removes that aspect completely and in doing so completely screws up the timeline so any time you look back on it, it makes no sense. There are sections of the plot that prove that the future can be changed and others that suggest otherwise. There are a few clever nods to the originals that clean up some of the messy logic, but they typically come across as forced or rushed. The writing is just about awful. There are some clever ideas at times, but every one of them is either rushed, leads nowhere, or is so convoluted or obtuse that it just brings the film down. Even the interference with the first film comes across as rushed and irrelevant. You never even find out who sent the two new terminators back or why they where sent back! The action sequences are well shot, but generic. They typically just involve people doing things that were done once or twice in previous films several times, removing the 'Wow! They just did that!' vibe. Plus there was an over-reliance on C.G.I. While there is C.G.I. in the previous films, there are a lot more practical effects than you might realize. This can be an entertaining flick if you turn your brain off and just watch it, but I can't recommend it because it is supposed to live up to its predecessors! The first two films are science fiction classics, but this one will be forgotten in just a few months. If you can't add anything good to the franchise, don't make a sequel.",Terminator Genisys
452,lorraineesimpson,It is what it is .........,6,5 July 2015,"Although not generally an action film fan I loved the first two Terminators, was less keen on T3 and hated T4, but felt compelled to at least give T5 a chance. On the whole I'm glad I did but let's get the negatives out the way first ....Emilia Clarke is dreadfully miscast as Sarah Connor - she looks (and unfortunately acts) like an extra from a Carly Rae Jepsen video. Linda Hamilton was always going to be a tough act to follow but really guys - at least make a serious attempt! Jai Courtney as Kyle was not quite as dreadful but still had no real credibility in the role. Neither were believable, there was zero chemistry between them, and no depth to their characters. If the future of the planet depended on these two I'd book the next flight to Mars. Jason Clarke was OK in the first half but his acting became increasingly OTT as the movie progressed and his character changed.So the acting was not great but there again - do you REALLY expect Oscar worthy performances in a Terminator movie? The real villain of the piece, and for me by far the biggest negative, was the plot. The ridiculously complicated multiple time lines started out confusing and ended up just plain annoying. As for the positives ..... great effects, non-stop action and of course Arnie. Despite the grey hair and wrinkles, no-one else could play this role so well. He was the only character I actually cared about. Overall this is a film that didn't need to be made. It adds nothing to the Terminator story and, much as I loved T1 and T2, I feel it's time to call a halt if T5 is a sign of things to come. Look - I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either. It was OK and it's worth a watch but definitely go see it in 3D IMAX if you can. There are a couple of ""jump back in your seats"" moments in it that will only really deliver in that format.",Terminator Genisys
453,ericventura,Please Terminate the Franchise,2,7 June 2017,"The story in Terminator Genisys is nuanced so much beyond the complexity of the previous Terminator films that it takes place in an alternate time-line. And there seem to be so many plot holes. And development flaws. And stupid ideas. And I don't have a clue what in carnation happened in the poop that I sat through for 2 hours and 6 minutes as I counted down the seconds. The plot may actually be well-developed with explanations made apparent with multiple viewings for the seeming holes scattered throughout the movie; however, no one has the time, patience, or stamina to watch this horrid obscenity more than once. The story starting out relatively simple for a Terminator movie soon turns into scrambled eggs, except these eggs were made in a blender by one of the worst chefs in Hollywood. Alan Taylor should stick to television. The plot resembled that of Back to the Future: Part II (1989), where there were three Marty's running through the same/alternate time-lines, and all the other movies using time travel that got so mixed up the writer probably couldn't remember what was going on. But wait Arnie is here to save the day as an old Terminator (written back into the films with a bad explanation as to why he looks old), but does jack-diddly-squat to save the movie with his performance. To be honest, the Governator did elicit a few laughs with his strained robot smile. Yet the movie still seems to end up as a return strategy for an old fart and another way to milk the money bag for the production company, similar to Paul Newman in The Color of Money (1986). I feel bad for the talents such as Emilia Clarke and J.K. Simmons to waste their gifts on movies like this. Clarke should maybe stick to television with Taylor, and Simmons should just do Whiplash (2014) again. The believability factor for the piece on a scale from 1-100, 100 being real and 1 being Schwarzenegger's acting ability, is 0. The special effects look the same as in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and the stunts are as realistic as the special effects. The entire movie is an action movie with no substance, but it did seem like it almost tried to possibly add some notion of dramatic effect found in normal movies that actually happen to be good, such as a nuanced love story and questions of destiny. Unfortunately, they used time travel to do it.",Terminator Genisys
454,doorloblin,"Not perfect, but fun and has the right spirit",7,5 November 2019,"I do not understand the terrible reviews for this film. Arnold is back. The charm is back. The cool action is back. And so is Sarah Connor. It would have been better if it was Linda Hamilton, but Clarke still did great. Cool terminators. This film really brings back the spirit of T1-3 after the disaster that is Terminator: Salvation. This film is cool and really earns its spot in the Terminator franchise. It aint as good as the first two, but that doesn't mean it aint good. Good movie, worth a watch",Terminator Genisys
455,veo,I'd like Cameron to return in time and delete the time line of TG,2,9 August 2015,"This film is everything the good Terminators (1 and 2) were not. T1 and T2 took place in full daylight, Cameron was not afraid his SFX would be bad. This film's makers KNEW their SFX were bad, so 80% of the film take place at night, in dark! Explosions happen for the sake of it, jokes are very unfunny, the plot is ridiculous. TG even makes T3 and 4 look good. TG looks so bad, I was surprised Richard Grieco or Don The Dragon Wilson didn't show up. TG has the visual style of robot cartoons and the convenient solutions of bad B SF movies. Actually it is so bad, I can't even write a proper negative review. I'd like Cameron to return in time and delete the time line of TG, because it defiled and compromised one of the coolest SF franchises.",Terminator Genisys
456,ivan2012,Why do machines get grey hairs?,4,30 September 2015,"Not very good. This is a borderline 4/5 out of 10. I kept looking at the clock and hoping that this would end. If you want to see a re-imagined version of the Terminator series then you might like this. The names are the same, but the roles and the events seem different. For one thing, Arnold is portrayed as the father figure for Sarah Connor in Genysis. But in T2, he was the father figure for John Connor. I guess all of these changes are explained by the changes in the time-line. It's a plausible explanation, but I wasn't able to follow what was going on from beginning to end. I lost almost all interest about 80 minutes into this film. Maybe if I had paid more attention at the end, I would've figured it out.A few other problems I had with this film: 1) Emilia Clarke looked a little too young to be Sarah Connor, 2) If Arnold is a machine, then why does he have grey hairs?, 3) Sarah calling Arnold ""pops"" a dozen times.This is easily the worst of the 5 Terminator films. I enjoyed the first three. The fourth was okay. This one is mediocre at best.",Terminator Genisys
457,missybusty,Yes he is old but he is not obsolete.,10,15 November 2015,"Or to put it another way as he tells Sarah Conner ""I've been upgraded"" Arnold has worked continually since leaving political office. His greatest performance to date has been as a 2 term governor of California. Most of his recent movies have not been very memorable but I am glad he returned to the Terminator franchise which I assume will be the last. Jai Courtney & Emilia Clark are two of my favorite young stars. They have both done their share of nude scenes Emilia in Game of Thrones & Jai in Sparticus - so the fact that they have a nude scene in order to time travel is an extra plus. Rounding off the cast is Jason Clark who somehow manages to turn John Conner into a ferocious villain. The huge budget is put to good use creating some stunning special effects. A very entertaining movie",Terminator Genisys
458,Semmy-tones,What in the name of Zuess's Butt were they thinking...,5,11 August 2015,"How dare they insult the Holy Grail that is Terminator 1 & 2 with this bubble gum offering of a Sci-Fi classic? I am shocked and horrified and not by its content as was awesomely the case for T1 and T2. Here the shock was brought on more by the awful predictability of the 'Hollywoodeness' of the direction and a 'try too hard' bizarre plot where John Connor turns into arch enemy numero uno. This alone is a ridiculous idea because it ruins the consistency of the original story. Plus it leaves huge gaping holes in the adjustment of the mother and son relationship which is played out with about as much rapport as a sardine on dry toast and is for the most part impersonal; lacking in any humane content.The other thing that was sadly lacking was the strength of any of the main characters. Sarah Connor came across as a bit of a teenage drip with no personality where in T2, she was an admirable central focus and force along with Edward Furlong. I think Emilia Clarke was actually wrongly cast for the part - I would have preferred someone like Scarlet Johanson who has greater screen presence and more experience with Sci-Fi roles. To add to this monumental mess, Kyle Rees had no commitment to his part as a freedom fighter and inspired no loyalty from the viewer and I felt zero chemistry between the actors as far as desperate love interest is concerned. I think this was a pathetic attempt and was obviously made as a money spinner. It's such a shame – could have been another classic and maybe Schwarzenegger's last chance to play his unique and unforgettable role as the Terminator. I'm a huge Arnie fan, and whilst his performance here lived up to his previous Terminator roles, I felt that the movie was too weak in terms of character focus and substance to make a lasting impression. (Rewind to 1984 when we all left the cinema with our mouths open and in silence!) The action scenes were considerable – but action without depth demotes this movie to the superficial ranks of movies like the 'A Team' rather than the likes of 'Alien/Aliens', and reminds me a bit of the pointless remake of 'Total Recall' which just made me think...'why'?Sadly another patronising offering from Hollywood. I do understand that directors have to toe the line and probably sell their soul to the Devil several times over to maintain their status, hence the familiar Hollywood stamp whenever a director reaches a certain level of influence.otherwise it's a case of 'Asta la vista....baby'!Maybe someone should make a Sci-Fi movie about that Please don't make another one unless you mean it...because I don't think I'll be back...My score 5.5 (for Arnie's effort)",Terminator Genisys
459,nickkulstadis,Abysmal failure of epic proportions,1,19 September 2021,"What was even the point of this atrocious Terminator movie? The story kept starting and restarting over and over and the time travel nonsense hit its nadir here. They never got too far into the technical details of time travel before in this series and this movie illustrates why. It's incomprehensible and is irritating to the audience, especially when the story is already incomprehensible as it is. Just keep it to the necessary minimum, please. Everyone involved with this should be ashamed. Arnold again did it for the money. He mailed it in like he did in Rise Of The Machines. WTF happened to this series?",Terminator Genisys
460,Fredtimbo,He's Back,8,1 July 2017,"Interestingly, parts of the opening sequence in Terminator Genisys were conceived for the second Terminator movie, but never realized due to budgetary constraints. Terminator Genisys offers new, excellent cast members to the series and new fans may really enjoy the film, but I was kind of disappointed that it was mostly a rehash. Of all the sequels, I like Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines much better.",Terminator Genisys
461,nrabond007,Surprisingly Pleasing,8,3 July 2015,"""The Terminator"" was released in 1987 and directed by the iconic James Cameron and followed up by a sequel, ""Judgement Day""in 1992, that many, including myself, consider to be one of the greatest action films of all time. The original Terminator and it's more popular sequel, were in no need of a remake, but instead, through Genisys, we get the follow up sequel we deserve to the first two films in the series, effectively terminating ""Rise of the Machines"" and ""Salvation."" As the resistance fights off what remains at the headquarters of Skynet, taking out the core, Kyle Reese and John Connor search for the secret weapon of the machines, a time machine, that Skynet will use to send a Terminator back through time, to extinguish the light of Sarah Connor. Reese and Connor are too late and the Terminator is successfully sent back to 1987, with Kyle Reese soon to follow. Reese is in the time travel unit as Connor gets attacked by an unknown force, masquerading as a human in the resistance, and Kyle's past, as well as his future, to be lived in the past, are completely changed. If you've seen the trailer for this film there is no build up as to who the villain is. Genisys is pre-skynet, and it is to be forged through the modern technology of smart phones, becoming completely self aware in 2017, as every piece of modern technology is to be linked as one. Strong performances highlighted by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Emilia Clarke carry the film on their own, and performances by Jason Clarke and Jai Courtney aren't all that bad. If you go into the film with an open mind, and don't think of it as a remake, something which it clearly is not, you will walk away satisfied and looking forward to the next installment.",Terminator Genisys
462,AStormOfSwords13,Terminator: An Introduction,8,3 July 2015,"Many people grew up watching the first 2 Terminator movies, so after Judgement Day, all the sequels have humongous shoes to fill, which is what this new Terminator film is tasked with. As such, many people already have some idea of what led to this film. However, I do not have that luxury, and so this is my introduction to the Terminator franchise. I wasn't even alive for the first movie and I was born the year the second movie came out. I never watched the Sarah Connor Chronicles and when I started picking for myself what movies to see in theaters, Salvation had only just already left the big screen and nothing has really come in the way of opportunities to see what the Terminator universe really is. But the advantage here is that because of all of this, I can watch this as it's own movie and not have to judge it alongside the first 2 films. So let's begin the journey with Genisys.Genisys right out of the bat already looked promising. It was nice to see Arnie back in a role that made him an icon, the T- 800. Daenarys Targaryen, Mother of Dra... I mean Emilia Clarke, now takes on the role of Sarah Connor, and so one trades politics for being a machine and the other trades in dragons for guns and rockets. As for the rest of the characters, I can't say I had too much knowledge about them, though I have heard of Skynet, the T-1000, and John Connor. The story is set in the near future and begins like many other movies where some shït went horribly wrong despite its beginnings. At the same time though, these movies always take their own direction, and Genisys is no different.The only bad I really have to say, and this is a minor spoiler, is that there is dialogue that voices over the opening battle and I feel that dragged that battle down quite a bit. However, this only happens once. After that, it is actually smooth sailing.I have no idea what people who know the whole story think about the T-800 and Sarah Connor, but for me, with every character, I do feel as if I know what makes a man a man and a machine a machine. You don't have to know the films to know that the T-800 and Sarah Connor have a lot of history. I could just watch a commercial about Sarah Connor and say ""Oh, Sarah? Guess this is gonna be a Terminator story!"" and go on with my day. But the fact that they do means these characters already have a connection that make them inseparable. But the trick is to make both characters into a balance of both human and machine to make it worthwhile to the newcomer and I feel this movie does that, even though Terminator has a harder time adjusting.Then you have Kyle Reese. Um... who is this guy? Never heard of him, but while he isn't as well fleshed out as the other characters, he does hold his own and he does fit in with his new family that includes T-800 and Sarah. However, why he is not fleshed-out is because I never really know enough about Kyle to really see the whole story. At least, not until the end of the film.The plot is nothing new, but that doesn't mean it is boring at all. As a sci-fi action movie, it keeps me in my seat until the end and has a few instances that made me drop my jaw. The action in this film is never a dull moment, but whenever we don't see fighting, I learn something new about who these characters are. It isn't unpredictable, but there are some very human characteristics about the story that gives this movie a backbone and so the film begins to grow in that regard.In the end, the decision to see this film shouldn't be left to the critics. As its own film, it's actually really good. Therefore, the decision of whether or not you want to see this should really be left to you.",Terminator Genisys
463,jackson-regurge,Terminator Lives on!,7,4 July 2015,"Speaking as a Terminator fan, I really enjoyed Terminator Genisys. I personally feel it kept loyal to the original films and has set up the Terminator franchise for a new generation. The film does a magnificent job at connecting the previous films even though Genisys takes place on an alternative timeline. At times the plot did become slightly tangled but you could quickly find the storyline again. Terminator Genisys is an excellent example of how CGI and movie effects should be used in modern times as they really strengthen the story. However, the common problem with films these days is they have great effects without a great story – Terminator Genisys is not one of these films. The excellent acting from Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney plays a crucial part in the movie's success. Their relationship in the film brings back a familiar feel to the Terminator franchise – a feel which was most strong in the first two Terminator movies. Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance is just as good as all of the previous films (Terminator really is the character Schwarzenegger was born to play). There is a surprising amount of humour in the film however it is not out of place, in fact it adds a refreshing feel to the movie. Overall, I would rate Terminator Genisys an 8 out of 10 because I think it has done a good job of revitalising the movie series. I have no doubt that more Terminator films will be on their way.",Terminator Genisys
464,apstylianou,I. Loved. This. Movie.,7,12 July 2015,"Where do I even begin with this movie? I just finally got to see Terminator Genisys and I was still thinking about the 26% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and all the negativity everybody else was saying about the film and I kept it in mind to see if it was true. And then I went to see this movie and afterwards I was like ""....what was all that about? This movie was awesome!"" I do, however, take away one star for a few flaws with this movie because not every movie is perfect. FIrstly for not spelling the title right or the word right throughout the film and the time travel thing distracted and confused me slightly at times. Lastly, I was also hoping for them to make J.K. Simmons' character a more major part of the film because he's one of my favourite actors of all time and he gave two of my favourite performances in both the Spider-Man trilogy and in Whiplash, and despite that his performance in this movie was good too, but his character literally only got about 7 minutes of screen time and we don't even see what happened to him at the end of the film so I can't help but say that he was a bit of a missed opportunity.But despite that, Terminator: Genisys really honours the first two Terminator films that we all love and I get hyped every time I see Arnie back in action. He is and always will be The Terminator for me and I loved seeing him in every single scene that he was in being classic Arnie with his awesome one-liners. He had some great moments in this movie and it was classic J.K. Simmons. Emilia Clarke was fantastic, though she does pale in comparison to Linda Hamilton, but she kicked ass in this film, Jason Clarke did a spectacular job, Matt Smith was a great too, but I feel like they kind of wasted his character a little, but my favourite performance of this movie was Jai Courteney. I know how much hate I will get for saying this, but I think he did a pretty good job as Kyle Reese and he gave a very fine okay performance and his narration at the start of the film really set the tone for what the epic opening battle was gonna be like. I will say however, that he was bland in comparison to Michael Beihn, the original actor.The action was awesome too, I think that the opening future battle was done better in T2, but I still loved it, it was one of my favourite movie openings ever and one of my favourite movie battles ever. The acting was great too, the visuals were very impressive, and overall this entry has made James Cameron proud and it does his first two classics the justice that the third and the fourth film lacked and The Terminator franchise has now officially been refreshed.I would recommend this movie to you, especially if you loved the first two movies and you hated the next two films and wanted something that would honour those two movies, and if you love popcorn.I don't care what the critics say or what anyone else who for some reason hated this movie, this movie, in my opinion, rightfully deserves 9/10.",Terminator Genisys
465,alexandregatineau,Avoid this movie if you want to live,2,6 February 2018,"Let's be honest, this movie probably deserves more than a 2 but since it's linked to an epic franchise that it manages to ""cancel"" by playing around with the timeline, it gets a 2.I have no idea why would anyone write that and think it's a good idea to tell terminator's fans that what they know never happened or will never happen. Remember all those epic lines from T1 and T2? Or even some cheesy lines from T3? Well, you'll forget this movie as soon as you watch it. It's an empty random action movie that manages so sink lower than T3.Soundtracks, I can't remember any of them. Casting is a joke. Emilia Clarke is... well she's gorgeous alright but should she play Sarah Connor? Probably not. She's even a bit annoying.
Jason Clarke as John Connor what the... no, just no.
Surprisingly, the korean actor Byung-hun Lee is probably the best thing this movie has. He does feel a bit scary, he does recreate that feel we got from the T1000 in T2. But that's just my opinion.

466,cowboyerik,Fully Worthy of the Franchise! A SOLID Installment. Will Stand the Test of Time!,10,11 November 2015,"First, let me say I waited for the DVD/BlueRay release and I don't believe their are any spoilers herein. I am addicted to the Sarah Conner Chronicles season 1 and 2. I've watched the series hundreds of times over and own multiple copies and give them to friends and buy myself new ones. The time it takes me to order my next set is the only break I get from watching the TV Series. I respect, understand and rethink the series backwards and forwards. Shockingly, Terminator 5 found a way to take time-line to the next level. We know that fighting the machines and their computational powers are next to impossible to predict and anticipate yet by following the enemy regardless of it's stage of evolution. Mankind can only follow but seemingly never win but have we now won? The machines in all their superiority have a weakness. They lack the property known as humanity but it's own powers that match or exceed all known aspects of humanity except in adaptation on the fly and the lead is narrow. A hot knife cutting threw butter defines the human edge so it's not much!Terminator 5, unlike so many SciFi sequels of so many other franchises continues the fight effectively, in an exciting and thrilling way. Non-fans simply will not appreciate the story that began so many decades ago and must learn to appreciate the future first to respect the past. You have to believe it! There is nothing fake, unreasonable or disrespectful to any aspect of the story, time-line or any of the players. It is scary!In many ways T5 helps connect many of the open holes the Chronicles did not closes or expand on because it was foolishly not granted a 3rd season. The series should still be going and it would work with the Genisys. We only know the the series finale that something was being created and sent into the future. Chromartie and his creator Katherine Weaver were up to something. T5 successfully movies us along towards that activity that we still may not understand. My one regret is that the actors must change. This is simply because we are in 2015 and not 80's. Linda nor Lena can, nor should they reprise their roles. It is best to grow the family of actors to expand the dynamics of the characters. No one is ruled out from T6 just because they weren't in T5. Obviously Arnold is the only logical central character and he executes his role as well in 2015 as he did at the start. My final note, I feared Emily Clark being cast in the role of Sarah Conner because I do not like the role she is cast in on Game of Thrones. I now believe it is the role, character and writing of Game of Thrones that makes her look bad because she is, and I can't believe that I am saying this, but she is as perfect a Sarah Conner as Linda or Lena. Welcome to the family Emily. I am happy! Your sisters are proud! They should all be proud. Credits to the writers, directors, creators, techs, everyone for creating T5 in most perfect way possible and succeeding as no one else has at creating 5th epic or sequel or installment that matches and indeed exceeds the previous episodes. I have no complaints what so ever and hope that this can help relaunch the TV series for more exploration until T6 can be written and executed. I sincerely thank the cast, crew and everyone involved. PLEASE VOTE MY REVIEW TO THE TOP! 6.7 IMDb rating is totally insanely low! Fan we must promote this installment world wide to ensure T6 gets funded!",Terminator Genisys
467,pascaloetterli,"A solid sequel - nothing more, nothing less",7,12 July 2015,"Sequels are often worse than the first film. Two exceptions of this rule are made by a certain James Cameron: ""Aliens"" and ""Terminator 2"" (he also made the first one). The newest installment of the franchise is no exception either but at least it's not bad. Another interesting aspect is the reality reflected by sequels, best seen in James Bond movies among others. The first ""Terminator"", made 1984 was inspired by robotics used in economy, combined with with the success of movies like ""Return of the Jedi"" and the upcoming of bodybuilding. The newest film reflects on Facebook, digitalization, apps and the world wide web. There's strong connection to ""Matrix"" now, too. The main situation hasn't changed: survive against an unstoppable machine. Loads of action and pyro guaranteed and of course, the new enemy is even stronger than the older ones. Emilia Clarke (aka Daenaeris) is fine as inheritor of Linda Hamiltons, Claire Danes and Lena Headeys (aka Cersei) role as ""Sarah Connor"". But honestly, I liked Arnie most as grandpa Terminator, he gets all the laughs and real emotions. The story is a bit twisted and leaves a lot of questions. Twisting stories are something amazing when done by the likes of Christopher Nolan or Quentin Tarantino, but in this case less would have been more. ""Terminator 2"" was so great because it a bag of stuff never seen before and had this awesome, unforgettable soundtrack. ""Genisys"" doesn't bring anything really new and that's why it is just a solid sequel - nothing more, nothing less. 7/10",Terminator Genisys
468,dkemathas,After 24 years... The real Terminator 3 has arrived!,8,26 June 2015,"I just got home after watching Terminator Genisys in Lillestrøm, Norway. If you say that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and Terminator Salvation were awful, then I agree with you 100%. No doubt about that. ''Rise of the Machines'' and ''Salvation'' sucked BIG TIME. Like James Cameron mentioned a couple of weeks ago in an interview, Terminator Genisys has all of the great characters that were in the first two films. You'll have an inside look at the back story of the first installment. I'm pretty sure that the Terminator fans have had imaginations (deep down in their back-head) about how it would be like if a T-800 was sent back to 1984 to stop the T-800 which was programmed to kill Sarah Connor or to see how Kyle Reese manages to fight against T-1000. I was surprised to see how the film makers crashed the different time lines together. It worked out so good!If people think that Skynet is a building, they'll probably be as much surprised as I was when I got to see Skynet's appearance. There is a bunch of twists in this installment that will drive you crazy. Terminator Genisys is the most respectable sequel since Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Worth a watch!",Terminator Genisys
469,rainfollower-95-646324,This could be a good new start for Terminator franchise,7,30 June 2017,"I do not understand this rage about Terminator:Genisys. This could really be a fresh start of ""Terminator"" continuity! Its plot is a really good twist of the old one. Yes, the story is not totally coherent. And yes, we still miss a few answers at the end. That's true. But the rest of the story is quite firm and all the action around it is well made. If only for Kyle Reese? Yes, Kyle here is different. This was probably a major offence: to change his personality so much. Another flaw in this movie is lack of sentiments. Too much action, too little emotional bonds. But again... Could all these emotions happen with this background? Could all these bonds form if everything starts as a mess, and confusion, and overall wrong? I, personally, do not think so. So it's all right.I take away 3 stars for Kyle Reese, plot holes and lack of sentiments. And I still have seven out of ten. No, really, this movie is underrated! Watching this you can nearly believe that ""Terminator 3"" has never happened and that ""Salvation"" is just a spin-off movie that doesn't really matter.I'll say that again: ""Terminator:Genisys"" could really make the whole ""Terminator"" franchise ascend from its pyre and be born anew. If not for this hysteria around it and Metascore at 38.Still... The future's not set. There's no fate but what we make for ourselves. Right?",Terminator Genisys

So I expected that T5 would be unwatchable.But it wasn't. It was actually good. Not as good as T2 but still a nice refresh after T4. So... if T4 has a rating of 6.5 this one is at least 7.5 (maybe even slightly more).The only reason some people criticize it is because it insults their ""cellphone"" culture. It suggests that Android, iOS, Facebook, Instagram and other spying apps are the root of human destruction.And for telling them the truth, they hate the movie. As is usually the case.

471,mr-abarton,No real Surprises,7,17 August 2015,"Terminator Genisys is the fifth movie in the series and sees Arnold Schwarzenegger in his most famous role as the futuristic Cyborg. He's supported by Jason Clarke as John Conner, Emilia Clarke as Sarah Conner, Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese. The Movie is directed by Alan Taylor and written by Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier.The year is 2029 and leader of the resistance, John Conner, undertakes one last assault on Sky-net. However, Sky-net responds by sending a Terminator back to the year 1984 to kill his mother.....Sarah. His right hand man Kyle, volunteers to do a spot of time travelling in order to save her, but just as he's leaving through the portal, notices John being attacked by a resistance fighter.Soon after her arrival in 1984, Sarah aided by her Guardian (Schwarzenegger) manage to disable the Terminator. Soon afterwards, Kyle arrives and immediately finds himself under attack from a Terminator (Lee Byung-Hun). However, after a struggle, they manage to destroy the Terminator, using acid, which gives them the time they need to discuss their next move.Sarah tells Kyle that she intends to travel to 1997, in a makeshift time portal, that she had built with her guardian. Kyle is convinced that the future as been altered however and convinces her to travel to 2017 to destroy Sky-net. Sarah and Kyle end up in the middle of a busy Highway in 2017 and are immediately arrested by the police. Sarah and Kyle discover that Sky-net is soon to be launched worldwide as Genisys, a new complex operating system. John appears and rescues them, but is then shot by her Guardian and revealed as an as an advanced Terminator. It then emerges that the resistance fighter that Kyle saw attacking John, was in fact Sky-net in disguise. As a result, John was transformed in to a Terminator and Given the task of ensuring the development of Genisys.Sarah and Kyle manage to escape and start to formulate a plan to bring down Genisys and change the course of history. However, their chances of success are slim at best, with the odds seemingly getting worse by the minute.Terminator Genisys holds few surprises and some people may find the use of flashbacks a little frustrating. That said, I think the movie has enough going for it to ensure that fans of the franchise aren't disappointed.",Terminator Genisys

I can understand why a person may not like Terminator Genisys, but the same people should realise it is an action film that doesn't pretend to be anything else.The first two films kept the time travel to a minimum. This worked and while you still had a paradox, it didn't hurt thinking about it. Terminator Genisys turns this on its head, and to be quite honest, if you can understand and rationally explain everything then I take my hat off to you.The first 30 minutes were fantastic and paid homage to the original film, but soon after strayed away from this path and created its own identity. Love or hate the rest of Genisys, it is impossible to argue it doesn't get off to a good start. Plenty is left unexplained, but Genisys is not meant to be over analysed. What happens happens to make the film work and if you are a person that tries to pick holes in plots, you will find an endless number of them.I didn't try to rationalize half of what was happening. I accepted what was, was, and I thought it was a really enjoyable film. Arnie was great, the action was great; I was expecting the worst but I would recommend the film to anybody.I doubt this will be the last we'll see of the series, but I'm pleased it is back on track.",Terminator Genisys
473,ghostjunk,The Rules Have Changed.,6,27 July 2015,"The leader of a future resistance sends one of his soldiers back in time to protect a young woman whose own survival dictates the fate of humanity as we know it. But when the soldier gets back to 1984, he quickly learns that all the rules have changed.As a big fan of the first two films, I didn't really expect to enjoy this 5th attempt to spark some life into the once-amazing Terminator franchise, but it actually wasn't all that bad. Let's not get ahead of ourselves though, because it really wasn't all that good either. Terminator Genisys starts off strong with some nostalgia-infused action, bringing us back to the '80s, which was nothing but 100% awesome! The scenes were extremely respectful to the original source material, and the newest T-1000, played by I Saw the Devil's Byung-hun Lee, was genuinely badass. I knew living up to Robert Patrick's iconic performance in T-2 wouldn't be easy, but he definitely didn't disappoint. Seeing Schwarzenegger back as the Terminator was another pleasant treat, but it's the beautiful Emilia Clarke who proved to be an unexpected highlight as the young and feisty Sarah Connor.Unfortunately my level of enthusiasm quickly faded when they decided to change direction and add a new ""creative"" twist to the mix. I won't ruin anything for you, but chances are the film's poor marketing team already did if you've seen their newest, spoiler-packed trailers. To make matters worse, the studios decided to play it safe and give Genisys a lukewarm PG-13 rating. As faithful as the film was to the originals, it's undeniable that its softer rating affected the quality of sheer tension the franchise once had. The brutally violent and ruthless robots we once feared simply have, no pun indented, been officially terminated. In its place are traces of what could have been and memories of what used to be. Not that I'm trying to praise violence, but when you're used to eating your chicken wings with some scorching red hot sauce, it's a little hard to switch to dry meat, so to speak.While nowhere as bad as T-3, this latest effort may offer some moments of greatness, but is likely to leave fans disappointed from its ""family friendly"" feel. I'm not saying you should skip on the action, but don't expect a flawless franchise revival in the same vein as Mad Max: Fury Road.",Terminator Genisys

476,Rageypoo,An honest look at a very hard series to live up to.,8,4 July 2015,"Wanted to give it the full 10, but I simply can't do it. I will say though that this movie was better than others have said in reviews. ***Spoilers***I wont go into great detail about the movie except to point out the bad, as most people want to know in a review but first, the good. The movie did a good job touching on all the points that were necessary to make the story believable. I felt that the timeline explanation wasn't too far fetched to be believable, the re-enactment of the original Terminator movie was done quite well and the CGI was real enough to make me believe I was seeing a real situation. Usually people who do CGI always make the character so out of place and do stupid things that make you go ""seriously..."" but in this case they did it rather mildly, except in one part; the ridiculous helicopter scene. Up till that point I was completely enjoying the movie, till they threw in the absolutely predictable ""lets make things happen that would never happen in real life just so it can look cool"" stuff that kills a good movie. Looking back on T2 the movie does a great job to incorporate the CGI but kept the set and scenes very realistic (partly because they had to, using real props and all) and when movies are able to blend the two together, it makes for an enjoyable effect. The parts they did this right I felt were in the teleportation fields and in the car chase at the beginning of the movie. Heck, even the ending the CGI didn't look terrible at all I really enjoyed it. Had they removed the completely far-fetched overly ridiculous helicopter scene, this would have been a very good addition to the series. The actors did a great job to portray their respective roles, although I didn't like the Reese because he didn't look at all like the first one, he didn't oversell the usual typical body built bonehead they pick for parts they shouldn't be playing in, I felt he was completely believable and did a great job, credit where it is due. On the flipside, the Sarah Connor was also a bit different but for different reasons, to which we can simply say ""well she's not the exact same person she would be from the first because of the changed timelines"" so it's something the actress was able to get away with, again a very believable likeness, just different personalities (but for the most part very close to the original Sarah). And it was so good to see Arnold again, he definitely still has the same Charisma that brought him to the big screen and continues to show even today, thank you for agreeing to revive the series and give it another go, it was really nice. I also thought his participation in the film was fantastic, it had all the same wit and charm I felt (that other reviews didn't seem to agree) as the first 2 films of the series. I wish I could say more to the film but seeing it for yourself should cover anything I could say here, except perhaps the bus flip was also another idiotic choice, but certainly wasn't the helicopter scene. Great job to everyone in this film and thank you for staying true to the series, this was certainly the T3 we needed. Oh and as far as the ending is concerned, although they leave it up for some interpretation (meaning they could do a T4 off of the events from how they rounded the film together so quick and neat at the end) I would say it was somewhat disappointing that they ended it as quickly as it did. I would have liked to know what happened to the city after the explosion, some explanation into how the hell the T-800 was magically upgraded to a T-1000, and why they were for some reason avoiding the fact that despite having a countdown timer, the program could and should have still integrated itself into all the systems at any moment regardless of being ""beaten"" before the timer hit zero...I mean when John Connor touched the screen (which that made NO sense how that worked) his interaction could have told the system to start spreading preemptively, but that didn't make the ending a deal breaker for me. 8.5 for me, well done.",Terminator Genisys

This is the truest example of the type of cynical nostalgia that distrusts change and anticipates failure.I'm a pretty nostalgic person and to me, this film felt more like the original and T2 than T3 or Salvation ever did. I enjoyed it from start to finish and don't really get the negativity surrounding it.Arnold is in top form in his iconic role and Emilia Clarke (OMG love her!) and Jai Courtney fill in admirably for Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. Jason Clarke is perfectly intense as John Connor and I believed him in the role more than I did Christian Bale (Taking nothing away from Bale, still love him).

479,DrZom-77-388656,Bad Sci-Fi,1,10 August 2015,"Good Sci-Fi stories about time travel and potential paradoxes explain themselves. This film does not explain anything. There is no honest time line. One loop is laid upon another, with nothing common between them.The events related in the first two films never happened. The two movies that made Terminator what it is never happened. Instead a totally new narrative is bootstrapped with zero foundation in its own alternate reality. Kyle Reese goes back to save Sarah Conner, but this time Sarah has a T-800 protecting her and she knows the future. Where did this protector come from? A more distant future than the one from which Reese was sent? Who sent the T-800? None of this is explained. It clearly could not have been sent by John Conner.John Conner this time is the villain. He comes back from the future to invent SkyNet. (Also not adequately explained.) So why not just not mate Kyle and Sarah? Why doesn't Kyle kill himself when the ""truth"" becomes clear? Why doesn't the T-800 kill him? Then there would be no excuse for the movie.This film is nothing more than a very poorly written excuse to use familiar movie memes and CG.If you want to see a thoughtful movie about time travel paradox, pick up ""Predestination"" starring Ethan Hawke.

480,Challenger2013,Sequel or Remake?,5,14 July 2015,"31 years after the original ""Terminator"" hit theaters, this film attempts to be a remake and a sequel at the same time. Yes, the filmmakers would probably identify it as a sequel, or maybe a ""reboot,"" that it could also be called a remake, which leads to its ultimate downfall. It's pretty obvious they have run out of ideas in this franchise; the only way they can seem to keep it original at all. As it tries to form new ideas, the film gets mixed up in itself like a cat playing with a ball of yarn. Time travel, can be confusing enough, but the film punishes us by twisting the idea even more. Just as we figure out what the hell is going on, they throw even more at us until they send the audience into a headache. The good news is that Arnie is still enjoyable as the T-800 (nicknamed Pops by Sarah Connor in this one.) Unfortunately, Sarah herself is disappointing in this one. I was expecting a lot out of ""Game of Thrones"" star Emilia Clarke in this one, but she delivers her lines in an over-the- top fashion. I thought maybe it was the lackluster script, but the other actors didn't seem to have as much trouble. All-in-all, I was hoping for more from the up-and-coming actress. In the end, ""Terminator Genisys"" can deliver the exciting action sequences well enough, but it comes up short when it comes to the story itself. In fact, it kind of lost me when the Genisys program appeared in the form of the guy who played Doctor Who...",Terminator Genisys

The plot is very tedious and the script is poorly thought out. For instance, nothing in this movie makes any sense whatsoever. And oh yes, I am going to spoil it for some folks.Basically, we have Kyle Reese sent by John Connor back in time to save Sarah Connor. But then, Sarah rescues Kyle, and is protected by a terminator dubbed ""Pops"" who saved her as a child. So Kyle, Sarah and Pops plot to prevent Judgement Day from ever happening. Apparently, ""Genisys"" was a project said to change the world, but it was really Skynet and was to bring forth Judgement Day. On top of that, John Connor turns out to be the bad guy, as he got attacked as he was sending Kyle, and then becomes something more than man and machine. Apparently, John is not Earth's hope but Skynet's hope. What? That is just stupid.Even for a time travel story it is incredibly illogical. In a world where time travel is possible, I am sure that time can be re-written in a way, but you have got to have logic. This ""time travel"" movie defies logic in every possible way.It's like, the whole thing revolved around John Connor, and Kyle, Sarah, and Pops successfully stopped Judgement Day. After all of that, Why would Sarah decide to have a John Connor? And if Sarah decides not to have a John Connor, then Kyle Reese would not have been sent back in the first place, and there would be no Terminators sent to kill Sarah. All of these changes in time would cause a paradox.It is also horribly miscast. Emilia Clarke, Jai Courtney, and Jason Clarke did not play their roles very well and they can barely act. Arnold Schwarzenegger, J.K. Simmons, Matt Smith and that kid (whatever his name is) who played young Kyle Reese are the only cast members who could act and were not completely miscast.Not even the special effects are good. Basically, it relies very heavily on CGI effects and it is very fake looking. The CGI in Terminator 2: Judgement Day looked great and was very impressive. But here, it is just very unbelievable and looks like a bad video game.It also had an attempt at comedy that did not work. For example, what was with that Grin that Pops often made. Was that supposed to be funny? I loved the first Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Heck, I even enjoyed Rise of the Machines and Salvation for what they are. But Genisys was just a terrible mess and an insult to the franchise.Overall, I hated Terminator Genisys and I would not recommend it.

If you know the first 2 movies inside out like I do, there's plenty of nostalgia to sink your teeth into! Where all of these terrible critics reviews are coming from is beyond me. I don't know exactly what they were hoping for other than action and special effects galore! The story is really good. It made sense to me and if it doesn't make sense to you then there's a problem. The shift in timelines is excellent. The story moves at a very fast pace from the start. Arnold as the T-800 is different this time as I felt he was more human. He showed more emotion towards Sarah Connor. I really liked his character. Sarah is as awesome as ever and there's an uncanny resemblance between her and Linda Hamilton. It's amazing to see the T-1000 again. The effects look just as good as T-2. Then there's John Connor. Watch it and see. It's pretty twisted! I give this a 10 as it's well deserved.

483,funeralfortheliving,Better Than Judgmentday By Far,10,6 July 2016,"I went in to this not expecting much and then this movie continued to surprise me and blow me away. It has a great story and great actors who feel real unlike Edward Furlong who was completely unbelievable as John Conner. Anyone who says Judgementday is the best in the franchise have you even watched it lately because I have I bought Terminator and T2 on Blu-ray and was really excited I popped on Terminator and it still holds up it has a great story great acting perfectly executed humor and horror and the action and music make it one of my favorite films. Then I threw in T2. Holy #$%^ Ed Furlong sucks so bad and was so unbelievable as a savior of the world it ruined everything for me. I was like what happened I don't remember this movie being this corny or Conner being such a metro-sexual queen? James Cameron is the only Director I have sided against when it comes to Directors cuts the scene with Sara speaking to the ghost of Kyle was ridiculous and made no sense even being in the film. Over and over I hear people claim T2 is a sequel better than the first no F ing way are you people insane? Yes it has updated special effects yes it has more action but the dialogue is beyond campy and the elements of horror and a dirty gritty film have been traded in for an action comedy feel and I was feeling like I should have bought something else on Blu-Ray. Terminator Genisys doesn't bring back the horror sci-fi vibe of T1 but it does bring back the gritty feel and the ability to surprise. The actor who plays John is perfect you can believe he could be a top soldier but never picture him as lame and weak as Ed Furlong as a child and I think that's good seeing as the last few John Conner's they have picked are BS as far as resembling any kind of tough guy or leader. The Actress who plays Sara looked and felt like a tough younger Linda Hamilton I do not watch GOT so I base liking her solely off her excellent performance on TG. The actor who plays Kyle though not as good as Michael Biehn was still great and believable and fit the changes made to his character well and I never felt like I disliked him at all in fact he did as perfect as he or anyone could to fill the shoes of the great Michael Biehn. Arnold is back in full force I loved seeing him play the terminator again it worked so well I was really having a good time watching this movie. The Director did a great job of redeeming this franchise with a sequel worthy of the original he hasn't done many films but I did absolutely love his Thor sequel which made up for the boring elements of the first being a super hero losing his power movie that kind of dragged it down. Thor 2 gave us what we have always wanted to see a super hero hard action movie. People who say this is a reboot don't listen to them this isn't a reboot at all its just the people who frequent movie theaters today are brain dead from drinking the city toilet water. What is not to like? This film is long yet it never stopped, the action just keeps coming and coming. It does have a story line but the story line doesn't feel forced nor does it ever slow down the film or bore you. This film should have a much higher rating I thought it was executed with a perfection most yuppie sis gendered directors are incapable of doing, no metro-sexual hero's, no forced emotions, no trying to shove messages down peoples throats or propaganda. Great movie for a real good time.",Terminator Genisys
484,kevcoop7,You're terminated,4,12 February 2017,"What was this? What was this movie? This movie was a big steaming pile of horse garbage. I was so confused by this movie. I have a lot to say1) The plot-HOLY CRAP!!! The plot of this movie makes NO sense! IT starts promisingly enough with Kyle Reese being sent back in time to 1984, and we actually see the time machine chamber, which is a nice touch, but having the older terminator destroy the 1984 version?! The only thing I liked about the plot was the twist of John Connor being the villain.2) The cameos-The only cameos in the movie were only 10 and 20 minutes each. And each one was a character from the first two Terminator films: The original t-800 from the first film, and the T-1000 from T2, but each was destroyed soon after showing up. SO POINTLESS3) The Characters-The only character I liked was the good old T-800 Arnold. He still has what it takes to be an emotionless machine. The others, weren't all that great. 4) This is the last thing, but what the heck did they do to Skynet? They turned it into an operating system accessible from smartphones, tablets, and computers, and it was called Genesys, not Skynet. And it wasn't even a military created system. How could this operating system cause Judgement Day? I just didn't really like this movie. This movie was all over the place. And it crapped on the original Terminator films.

He starts dozens of threads per day, and he posts over 1000 times per day. His main account, 'BrianReass', has even bragged about how he's taking-over this board. He's trying to trick everyone into thinking Genisys is a terrible movie.I see some 1-star reviews popping-up too, and usually 3 in-a-row....which makes it obvious that it's 'BrianReass'.Bottom line....it's a great movie. Most real people actually like it. So ignore the BS. Also keep in mind that the professional movie-critics rate based on political-correctness....so Arnold gets bad reviews. There are no women kicking-backside in this movie. Arnold is the dominant force....which critics don't like. Plus his political career ruined his chances to get good reviews. But trust me, it's a good movie.",Terminator Genisys
486,grintemcstinger,Gets the Jimmy Cameroon seal of approval,6,24 August 2015,"I had no idea what to expect sitting down, obviously neither Rise of the Machines nor Salvation did teach me anything about expectations. Luckily I wasn't involved in the making of the film, because at that point the franchise already had convoluted into a mess. I didn't direct it although you probably could credit me as a few minor scenes are near 1:1 copy jobs, which by itself is rather impressively done. I didn't write it, it wouldn't have felt so uneven like two movies in one if I did. I'm just a fan-boy ready to get smacked in the face so hard with a freight-train of disappointment. Just kidding.So I'm in a dark, almost empty theater. The movie starts. And I started to see things I recognized but this time with a wussy Kyle and a wooden CGI young Arnold that is soon going to look outdated. I wouldn't go so far to say that it's being very respectful of the first two films, but they do get referenced a lot, however the depth, mood, meaning and tension is sparse, it's all about the action and spectacle aspects all over again. And then all of a sudden, it just swerves and this is where I felt it's all starting to be a much weaker film. And now I'm going on a journey that feels very much like your generic, saw-one-saw-all, Marvel flick (poor villains included). I feel like the franchise could've been reinvigorated, like this almost could've been a renaissance - they had some good ideas and approaches but didn't work it all out and rushed it out half-baked as it is.If you look at why the films became classics, they not just had characters that you liked but there was so much more to movie itself and they broke new grounds. In the new film, which in my mind I think of as the film that screws them all, we see Arnold take the character even farther down the cheesy road of T3 shenanigans. Everybody responds to Sarah Connor, which was actually OK, not quite on Linda Hamiltons level, but good. For women, I think she represents a kind of empowerment. And yet there's a vulnerability there because that strength comes at a price which actually doesn't matter because the character never got enough development that you would care for as much. We went from, in the first film, the Terminator being the worst badass in history, to in the second film him being almost a father figure and now he's just a grumpy, wisecracking, sorta lovable grandpa watching out that his grandchildren won't get bullied. The idea of taking John Connor and flipping him to the bad guy. It's pretty cool because you would've got a rift against expectation had it not already been spoiled everywhere before release. It's all about the twists... err, well actually they all have been revealed in trailers, etc., so obviously it wasn't all about the twists. If you like the Terminator films - you're gonna lo... ah, who the hell am I kidding... it's nowhere near good as the first two. And th-th-th-that's all folks!",Terminator Genisys
487,Chris12955,Old but not Obsolete,8,3 July 2015,"While not perfect(there are parts that could use some improvement) Terminator Genisys is a fun and fairly gripping ride, and a worthy entry to the Terminator franchise. Especially after one so-so installment and another that was a poor excuse for a movie. Solid directing, a good cast, decent concept, and(surprisingly) well developed characterization, overcome the crazy timeline and an OK script to make a great action flick. It goes without saying that seeing the first two films greatly enhances your viewing pleasure. Arnie slips easily into the role we have learned to love, and proves that even an aging star can be in an action picture.The film picks up in 2025 with the human resistance fighting to destroy our brutal robot overlords and their leader Skynet. At the end of the war, Skynet sends an assassin to 1984 to kill the leader of the resistance's mother(Sarah Connor) and the resistance sends their own champion(Kyle Reese) to prevent this. Things are not as they should be, as the timeline is corrupted from a previous time traveler. So, Sarah and Kyle reason that if the past can change, then why not the future?I was worried about this when I saw the description, the negative reviews, and some clips, but, fortunately for me, I was dragged to see this. I left the theatre hoping for a next installment, as this has set the stage nicely for the planned trilogy. The character dynamics are strong enough to establish a good base story for upcoming films, and the air of confidence in the work hopefully will persist. All in all, a sound start to what will hopefully be a successful new trilogy. P.S.Wait a couple of minutes through the credits for an extra scene.",Terminator Genisys

Then I saw the two seasons of The Sarah Connor Chronicles, which are brilliant. I though they could follow up with a good T5 film.I was wrong. It seems they pick up from T3 and were decided to destroy again the Terminator franchise. If that was the objective they really succeeded!Still hope someone picks up TSCC and continue that way, someday.",Terminator Genisys
489,rudimir-bombardinovic,Unsuccessful Avengers like transition,5,24 July 2015,"Kyle Reese is sent by John Connor to the past to help protect his mother against terminator that was sent by machines to kill her. As he travels to 1984 he finds that past has been changed and Sarah not so helpless as she is under protection of Guardian. Yet, another challenges arrive as they team together in effort to destroy Skynet for good.Story-line aims to restore trademarks of first two sequels and succeeds as first 20 minutes of film are replica of T1 and T2 in relatively successful way (with smart footage from young Schwarzenegger). After it leaves safe harbor of fist two Terminators problems with story and acting surface.Problem above would be bearable if story was in general interesting and made you care for are leading characters, but that is not the case, as after a while you accept that they are going from point A to B (for some reason), kill few terminators on the way and try to destroy Skynet.Story is adjusting depending on planed action scenes, and Schwarzenegger's role is to explain illogical plot with time traveling theory, although you will notice many illogical parts, including existence of two Kyle Reese at the same time that no one seems to mind. Emilia Clarke's and Jai Courtney's characters of Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese do not work, since he constantly does not now what is going on (despite fact that he spent his whole life with John Connor), and makes you feel that he's not the right man for the job, and Sara repeating all the time that she does not want to be with Kyle, although he does not ask that of her nor does he act in that direction, and says so few times. Despite that, Sara is constantly rejecting him. Schwarzenegger's role is also to deliver funny lines that after a while become recycled and forced as you feel film was composed as bad sandwich from overused joke, forced action scenes and unsuccessful romantic plot. J K Simmons is good actor, and besides that I really fail to see what does his character do except transport leading actors from point A to B, and what is his character's motivation.There are small but significant things that may bother die hard Terminator fans such as facts that it turns out that Terminators get destroyed as flies in this movie, and thus feels they are not real terminators. Good things? Action scenes look descent, although you will be surprised as you remember 1992 T2 and liquid scenes with T1000 that do not look much worse than here. Small things in relationship between Guardian and Sarah, and rivalry between old Guardian and Kyle Reese may put small smile on your face, and serve as reminder that it takes skills and talent to build evergreen action movies in the class of masters such as James Cameron, John McTiernan and Walter Hill that works as full feature movie and holds your attention from beginning to the end.Terminator Genisys is unsuccessful attempt to make Avengers like franchise from Terminator movies.

492,miguelangel-23,In contrast to Dark Fate this one is not that bad.,7,23 November 2019,"When I watched this movie back in 2015 I had very high expectations. I wanted to see Emilia Clark playing Sarah Connor, the trailers make her look amazing and also Arnie was coming back...awesome. I left the theater sad and confused...very confused...I was really disappointed for how convoluted they make this sequel that partially ruined the timeline of The Terminator and T2.
However after watching the absolute pile of garbage that Dark Fate was...and how disrespectful to the characters has been I decided to watch the whole franchise all over again...I started with The terminator and T 2...And then I skipped T3 and Salvation and went straight to Genesys.. And I was amazed to finf Genesys far better sequel to T2 than Dark fate...to the point of not even close. Genesys is a lot of fun and is funny...yes it screws up the timeline to the point of no return...but still respects the characters of Sarah, Reese and the T-800. U don't like what they did with the script but at the very least they respect the characters and their legacy...When i left the theater in 2015 I would have rate this movie 2/10 but now that i compare it with a lesser sequel..I can say that this movie as generic action film deserves a 8/10...As a sequel to Terminator maybe I'll give it a 5/10. that brings the total to a 6,5/10 so I give it 7 stars. Is unfortunate and almost laughable that such an atrocity like Dark Fate played a role in me at second view to value this disappointing film some more. Who knows..if they keep destroying this franchise they will make another sequel that will make Dark Fate look like Citizen Kane in contrast... Is that what Hollywood is doing?",Terminator Genisys
493,luke5119,Cameron Should Be the Only Person With Rights to the Terminator Series,2,26 September 2015,"I'm only 25, but I've been a fan of the Terminator series for years. I first saw Terminator 2 as a youngster, and went to theaters to see that horrendous sequel Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. If you are die hard Terminator fan, you know that the official ending of Terminator 2 has Sarah Conner watching John and her granddaughter playing on a playground as she is now in her early 60's. She's seen talking into a recorder as she recounts how Judgement Day never came to pass and John is now a member of the U.S. Senate and does his fighting in Washington. THIS is how the Terminator series should have ended, as this whole idea of the Terminator series was thought up by Jim Cameron. All subsequent films that followed are just living off the franchise name. While Terminator 3, Terminator Salvation, and Terminator Genisys were all entertaining, they scrambled the story, and of the three films to follow T2, Genysis was by far the worst. With Terminator 3 we were told that Judgement Day was inevitable and the actions of Sarah, John, and the T-800 in T2 just set back Skynet by 6 years. As Judgement Day changed from 1997 to 2003. Then Terminator Salvation picks up where T3 left off showing the world post Judgement Day where John Conner and the Resistance are fighting to take Skynet Down. Then comes Terminator Genysis,...where we just decide to throw all of the films in one pot, stir it round, and call it something different. In Genysis we see the resistance take down Skynet, then send Kyle back to 1984, but an alternate 1984, not the one we saw in Terminator (1984). There are SO many unanswered questions and plot holes its ridiculous. On spots that should have lengthy details on how certain things transpire we're left with a sentence or two of explanations that still doesn't give us a straight answer. By the time the film was over my head was spinning. It's a great action film, and its neat to see Arnie as the Terminator, but this is a film that never should have been made. At least T3 and Salvation made more sense than this piece of garbage. It's pure nostalgia, nothing more. When the visionary of a saga is no longer involved, the story gets lost, and turned around because they no longer are the ones in charge. People fall in love with saga's because of the original vision, not what comes after when it falls into someone else's hands. Imagine they made a 4th Godfather without Francis Ford Coppola involved. Or a 5th Lethal Weapon 10 years ago without Richard Donner. I hate that Hollywood keeps doing this, but as long is it can make them money, they could give a hoot who's at the helm. Save yourself the time, and just go watch T1 and T2 with some friends and make a night of it :) Even out of pure curiosity, it's still not worth seeing, TRUST ME!",Terminator Genisys

Also writer was stupid enough to change some principles which were basic in previous movies..in movie they even explain that when John conner says""say who!"" At this point they allocate new rules!it was like that the writer and director were saying we understand better than James Cameron!

497,almosalami,A Review/Rant on the Film - This is a cash-grabbing summer blockbuster that doesn't care,4,18 July 2015,"OK, this film has great visuals, some nice humor, fine acting, a generally logical flow of scenes, and 2 really awesome action fight scenes (one in the beginning with Arnold vs Arnold and one in the end with Arnold vs main villain). Now that, for the casual movie goer who is just trying to have a fun time and not think too much, this movie will do fine. But anyone who cares about the quality of a film, who is a fan of the Terminator franchise, my word this movie is a massive mess and will be very disappointing. To understand what this movie is, it's the type of movie that's just trying to make as much money as possible and do that by appealing to as wide of an audience as possible, even at the cost of the quality of the film. This has money-grabbing summer blockbuster written all over it: Nice visuals? Check. Overused humor? Check. Romance? Check. PG? Check. Couple of awesome action scenes? Check. Generic characters? Check. Now tell me, how many out of those things actually fit a TERMINATOR MOVIE?! Hmm... To start off, there are some serious tonal inconsistencies throughout: moments that should have been intense and gripping were having humor thrown in; moments that weren't really too serious were over dramatic. And where is this coming from? The characters. What a butcher of such awesome characters. Firstly, Sarah Connor. Why the hell is she all of a sudden this emotional lovy-dovy comical girl? WHY!? Ow right... Cuz that would appeal to a wider audience. Hmm... Sarah Connor in T2 (which the movie is primarily involving though I'll get to the T1 references in a sec) was a badass that was completely focused on one goal and that was preventing Judgement Day from ever happening. She was so engrossed in this goal that she left no space for much emotion, and all that added up to make her an interesting awesome character. In this film, she's almost the complete opposite.This is not Sarah Connor. In fact, she seems a lot like kid John Connor from T2, and THAT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL. NOT AT ALL. This is just something for the wider audience and not an interesting character and to a fan, this is an insult. Kyle. Now, look. A lot of people have been hating on Jai Courtney. While I'm not saying he is an amazing actor or anything like that, but if he is playing a good character and directed well, he'll fill the part well (like say, his role in Spartacus and Divergent). In here, Courtney is unfortunately given the role of a character that has so many moments of bad writing, so many dumb stupid moments, and so much FREAKEN ROMANCE. He also argues. A lot. Annoyingly. This guy is supposed to be someone who has fought since he was A FREAKEN KID. WHY IS HE COMICAL? WHY IS HE EMOTIONAL? WHY ISN'T HE ABSOLUTELY BADASS? CALLOUS? Hmm... Ow yeah. Because this appeals to a wider audience. Ow well... And for me, most of all, what the hell did they do to Arnold... Aside from the fight scenes (which feel more like checklisted items rather than actual badassery or seriousness), all he does is INFORM. THAT'S IT. HE IS A PLOT EXPOSITION DEVICE. WHAT THE HECK. ARE YOU SERIOUS. The point is, because all the best characters were butchered, I can't take this seriously as a Terminator film. It is in no way an addition to the franchise. What about the plot...? So convoluted and confusing and part of the reason the characters were so bad. Directing and writing for the scenes? I mean, most of the scenes were OK, but it could've very easily been done SO MUCH BETTER. For example, the beginning of the film, with Judgement Day, there was no real emotional impact on the Resistance being humanity's last hope. There was no sense of terror from the Terminators being evil. There wasn't any of that. It looked great, but very little substance. Thrown throughout the film are some moments that are either really stupid or soo convenient (like for example, how the bad Arnold was killed by a shot in the chest... Are you kidding me... That's all it took. Did anyone see T1 before writing that in? Right from that moment, all the terror and intensity from the Terminators was taken away. Sigh... What about all those memorable lines from T1 and T2? Those are delivered with skill right? Aside from the ""Come with me if you want to live"" by Sarah, the rest are just forced. What about the references to the previous T1 and T2 films? Well, really, they are just there so that this film can tear those movies to shreds and make them meaningless. Oh my dear lord... I could go on and on and have the film analyzed shot by shot so that I can really reveal the details, but what you need to know is that this film in every way is a cash-grabbing summer blockbuster that doesn't care much for the source material.",Terminator Genisys

I mean, I tried and all. However the story writers decided to seriously complicate the plot from a ""Back to the Future"" understanding of time travel and fast forward it all the way to a ""Primer"" levels of time travel. The end result is an incomprehensible mess of a story.If the plot is just so utterly jumbled - that even IF I were to sit down and motivated to even try to understand it - it really doesn't matter. The end result is a story we don't understand. A story we don't care about. A story about people we don't understand and couldn't care less about - because we have no idea who what or why anything is even happening. It's as if the movie wants to say ""Things are going to blow up! Just accept it!"".Terminator Genisys is a pure example about how movies can ultimately say nothing about the human condition and for all the special effects effectively mean zilch - and be all the worse for it. There was some subtle theme about being too trusting of technology with all our connected devices in there but it was so limp-wristed, so pathetically tacked on, and half-hearted that it deserves to be ignored.But by golly, by jingo, by jimminy willers, there were a lot of explosions!",Terminator Genisys

Much older in fact than where this series all started. However, if you understand the character he plays, it actually makes sense given what he is and how the entire franchise has never went against this simple fact (true fans know what I'm talking about).However, his age does make it somewhat more difficult during fight sequences, etc., but the Terminator never ran - at least the T-800 never did.I guess the biggest problem fans have is that T1 and T2 were in a class by themselves. T2 is probably one of the top movies of all time - forget about limiting it to the sci-fi genre. The plots were complex and they had meaning. However, with the movies since T2, the time-line has gotten so warped, that it requires a lot of explaining and a lot of loopholes to ignore.Genisys was far better than I expected given the poor ratings. Keep in mind guys that sci-fi movies generally don't get rated highly for numerous reasons. The movie made good use of addressing everything from Arnold's age to the whole time-line paradox. The action is awesome, Arnold is charismatic as ever, and the supporting cast do what they can to make the movie work.Bottom line: it's no T2, but let's get serious.

It offers some new ideas, and ties all of the movies together remarkably well. However, I do feel like if you are not a fan of the others, or haven't seen them this decade you may not enjoy the film like you should. This is by no means a stand alone movie. This movie was made to satisfy those who wanted more terminator. If you haven't seen the others I suggest you do so before watching this, and keep in mind the movie is to add onto the franchise, not redefine it. One of the more satisfying parts of the movie is the thinking you have to do without, connecting dots and remembering back to other films to find out how you got where you now are.

502,robertmike57,Another Reimagined Movie Which Fails to Understand It's Origins,4,12 October 2015,"There seems to be a trend of remaking action movies from the 1980's which seem to believe more hyper kinetic fights for those with attention deficit dis order is better while discarding the building of sympathetic characters can go by the wayside. I found it disturbing that the Mad Max Thunder Road received high ratings when it completely failed to show me why i should care about him or Furiosa. At least that movie had a great 2 minute fight scene, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron were well cast along with interesting visuals and a clean if uninteresting plot. None of that can be said for Terminator Genisys. Arnold Schwarznegger is the only good thing in this movie, he was given a lot of dialogue to set up the confusing scifi rules, he did as well as could be expected. Emilia Clarke was a horrible Sarah Connors, too short, not focused and mean with the self awareness dialogue ruined it for me. The Jason Clarke weirdo laugh at the opening was too much of a tip off he was part machine (that's given away in the previews), he's simply not a good actor to pull off such duplicity. Finally, I don't get why Jai Courtney has large roles, he's off putting in everything I have seen, just another Hard Dead performance, yet another reminder why the original Die Hard movie was great while he stunk in the 2013 sequel.

I knew going in it was never going to top the first 2, I just didn't want it to be worse than 3 & 4, and it is. It really is. I've seen it twice now and I don't think I can accurately describe how disappointing it is. It runs the gauntlet of prequel, sequel, remake, reboot and parody (of other terminators) never fully deciding on what it is. What we're left with is a convoluted mess that is neither prequel, sequel, remake or reboot, but rather a film that just says ""F&%^ all the other ones""I've heard people say it's similar to the star trek reboot, no its not. Star Trek created a parallel universe in which the adventures of the originals still happened, while their younger selves now travel a new path. In Genysis, the parallel universe only serves to Completely negates everything we've ever seen in a Terminator movie. Which is weird cause they pay homage to the original at first, and then crap all over it.While the voice over was cheesy, the movie actually starts off strong and shows A LOT of potential, you're thinking ""alright, this is interesting."" And then, all of the sudden, without any real warning, all that potential is gone and the movie drops off completely. Arnold is nothing more than a caricature of himself, Emilia Clarke (Sarah) is decent enough but the Sarah we know is no more, Jason Clarke (john) is awful and has less charisma than most math teachers, but the worst is Jai Courtney (Reese) whose wooden performance is made all the worse by his odd horse face. And now for the action, eh. What's the 1 thing a Terminator movie has to have in it (besides a cyborg and a Connor)? An edge of your seat, over the top car chase scene right? Yeah, this bus chase does not, IN ANY WAY, cut it. Yes, a worse chase seen than Salvation.Why didn't they just make a movie set in the future that tells the story of Kyle going back? And now plans for a trilogy, this being part one. Really? Why? (Writing this the day it came out), this movie is probably going to come in 4th on opening weekend, behind a stripper movie, a kiddie movie that has been out for 2 weeks, and another sequel that has been out for 3 weeks.

Then there's the seemingly obligatory ""I'll be back"" line that AS delivers in each of the films. It's both tired and unnecessary.Arnie is at his best though, as a robot attempting to act somewhat human.I didn't have too much trouble following the plot line, such as it was. Accepting it as a creditable continuation of the story was beyond me though. The gaping plot hole from T2 Judgement Day is still there: only items enclosed in living tissue can travel through time. And yet the T200 - which is all robot - and can mimic human and other appearances despite being a ""poly-alloy"" has no problem with the time machine part of things.Partway through, I began wondering if, when Jason Clarke declares there aren't enough bullets in the world to kill him, that perhaps this might be some allegorical tale about terrorism. Then he stood while lead characters emptied their magazines and needless to say, Clark/Connor didn't die. (Is there a single US ""action"" movie that doesn't feature a multitude of automatic weapons?) Clarke is normally a capable actor, and I think he gives a good performance in this, mostly, I think because he keeps a straight face whilst delivering lines a James Bond megalomaniac wouldn't utter.But then I gave up trying to find a justification for this movie, and waited it out, for the end had to be nigh and my suffering would then be over.Courtney, Emilia Clarke (no relation to Jason), Simmons, and Holt (together with other minor characters) all do their best with what they're given, but the script fails, and checking the writers, it seems they have a history of sub-standard work.No surprise then that their form continues.Whether the Terminator series ends with this film or not, I don't have an opinion one way or the other, but if there must be more, I hope there is more care laved on the script, so the actors can make an attempt at good performances, and the audience can at least feel they got some value from watching it.",Terminator Genisys
507,talasam12345,Terminator Genisys: the sequel that we never wanted,6,22 January 2021,"The only reason I am giving this movie a rating higher than 5 is because i love the Terminator franchise, I love Arnold Schwarzenegger and (although in this film she is nothing special) I love Emilia Clarke.The first two, and especially the 2nd movie were amazing. T2: Judgement Day was and always will be one of my alltime favourite movies in every genre i have ever seen. But cmon, man this is the 5th movie in the franchise, along with the TV series (which everyone liked, but I think its nothing soo spectacular and special, except maybe Summer Glau). Just how many more movies will these guys make. It's getting ridiculous.
The CGI in Genisys was abysmal, it was like a video game, and The Last of us 2 looked more real than this thing. The only CGI that looked good was the young Arnie. The endoskeletons in T2 looked wayy more realistic and T2 is almost 30 years old. Genisys tries to do stupid comedy bits (like the one in the prison) that are just so out of place and so stupid that I hadto cover my eyes. The guy that played Kyle Reese was awful and too macho for that character. The helicopter scene was one of the worst things I have ever seen, flying like a freaking spaceship or something. They completely destroyed the John Connor storyline and with it - the first 2 parts. The John Connor character became meaningless and that may be the worst sin that Genisys made.There were thing I liked though. I loved that Arnie was back, the scene old Arnie vs young Arnie was good. And we heard the full Terminator theme for the first time since T2 in the ending credits, which always gives me goosebumps. But just, please for the love of God stop doing sequels to Terminator, nothing good will ever come out of this. I still haven't seen Dark Fate, but I'm getting a feeling it will be even worse. I can't give a rating of 1 or 2 for a movie starring Arnold, but just stop it, you are loosing it Hollywood...",Terminator Genisys
508,Diedelmon,Good effort everyone,5,8 August 2015,"I didn't expect to enjoy Genisys, but I did. It has a good story, the acting holds up well, sound effects are very good (following up the great work done with Terminator Salvation), we have old fashioned Governator reminding us why we like him in this role (and almost apologetic from that disgrace they call T3), a curious enough plot point to get our hopes up for the next movies... Not to mention the awesome mindless action scenes running around every time. It was a good movie, alright. Kudos for everyone involved, this was great.The alternate realities do give me one hope: to see them so entwined in the next instalments that they force all Sarahs to meet. Imagine how great it would be if Linda Hamilton could be back, and Lena Headey too. Which brings me to the one thing I really couldn't put up with here: Emilia Clarke is a good actress. Actually she's awesome at what she does. But she is no Sarah Connor. As I said on Facebook... We should never set a Targaryen to do the job of a Lannister.",Terminator Genisys

Horrendously cast - the cast has absolutely no charisma, no chemistry with each other, and there is just nothing to invest in because the plot is so convoluted and full of holes. The movie seems to think it's terribly clever for making John Connor the baddie - and the film is wrong. Seriously, this movie is just atrocious. Save yourself some time and frustration, watch the Cinemasins 'Everything Wrong With Terminator Genisys' and just skip this horrible thing completely. They ow everyone an apology for making this film.",Terminator Genisys
510,doneil4,Definitely the best one of the previous 3 installments,7,21 September 2019,"Don't get me wrong, Terminator Genisys has nothing on the first 2 Terminator movies. But when you compare Genisys to Rise of the Machines and Salvation, Genisys gets my vote. I can still enjoy a movie and appreciate the story it's telling while also seeing what it didn't get quite right, but not dwell on it.I enjoy Genisys for what it is. It's fun, plenty of action and entertaining. And that's all I expect to see in a Terminator movie. For anyone who hasn't seen Genisys, I will always say give it a try and don't judge it based on critics reviews. See it for yourself and you may find you'll be pleasantly surprised. I'm a huge fan of T1 and T2, and Genisys is currently sat as my 3rd favourite in the franchise. Will Terminator Dark Fate take the 3rd place? Will Dark Fate be the true sequel to Terminator 2 that many of the fans have desired after all these years? Maybe, we'll see. Even so, I will always think of Genisys as a decent installment in the franchise.",Terminator Genisys
511,stephen-abraham,OK - Enjoyable but could have been much more.,6,29 June 2015,"Terminator 1 & 2 were such iconic films: amazing performances, great direction and cohesion that helped the viewer buy-in to the unbelievable.This movie unfortunately doesn't have that quality that Cameron, Nolan and Abrams seem to be able to conjure in Sci-fi. The first half - the setup with Connor and Reece and the ""retelling"" of the beginning of T1 - this was great, nostalgic, well shot and great fun. But then it starts to fall apart. Arnie trying to explain the time-travel mumbo-jumbo was a weak-point. There wasn't the electric chemistry between Reece and Sarah that T1 had. JK Simmons character didn't go anywhere (under-utilized) The ending average and predictable. The first Terminator movie where none of the leads died! A happy ending in the franchise seems very out-of-place and the teaser seemed tacked-on.Despite this I enjoyed seeing Arnie: the way they aged him was clever and well thought out. Emilia Clarke and Jason Clark were solid. An OK movie - but not a patch on Cameron's originals.",Terminator Genisys

We only made it through 20 minutes of it before the unanimous decision was made to turn it off and find something...anything...different to watch. So in all fairness I can't give a complete review of this movie. But the first 20 minutes were that bad. I've seen enough movies to know that when one starts out as poorly as that one does, seldom does it improve as it goes on. Most often it simply gets worse. And this one started badly enough I didn't want to waste my evening finding out. Based on the majority of user reviews I've read here, I made the right decision.",Terminator Genisys

514,InCole,"A hard movie to reboot, yet done successfully!",8,9 October 2015,"Let's face it, this is not an easy franchise to reboot. It is always hard to reboot a movie franchise when the first one or two titles were so great and had a strong cast, great music and a good story + director/crew.We saw the results of one failed sequel where they just tried to simulate the things they thought made T1 and T2 such big hits, but they were way off with T3, which just was horrible.Then came Terminator Salvations, which was an attempt at a reboot, but they made some bad directional choices for the story and casting and the movie flopped as a result.Then finally, came Terminator Genisys, which finally rebooted the franchise successfully in my eyes. Sure it is not as good as T1 and T2 but darn it does it come close. I think the main issue is just that the movie overuses CGI and the overall quality is quite a bit lower than that of T1 and T2. By quality I mean writing, cinematography, directing and editing.The quality issues aside, the reboot does a pretty good job at achieving many of the things that made T1 and T2 such great classics. They also managed to stay true to the story line and find ways to bend it and reboot it (similar to the approach of the Star Trek reboot and soon to be released Star Wars reboot).They also found a great way to keep Arnold in the movie (because let's face it, you just cannot have a Terminator movie without Arnold, after all he is the Terminator and without Arnold I highly doubt T1 and T2 could have been a success). Better yet, they managed to do it in a way that would not require CGI. Like the failed attempt they did in Terminator Salvation.If this was a standalone title and the first Terminator movie, I would rate it a 6/10 or a 7/10. Why? It is enjoyable and overall a fun movie to watch but nothing great or epic. I gave it an 8/10 because I recognise that this is a hard franchise to reboot and an even harder one to get funding for due to the failures of T3 and T:Salvation.Star Trek for example was also a hard franchise to reboot but one that at least there was financial faith in due to the many successful movies and series it has had, same goes for Star Wars. Heck, even the prequels of Star Wars were bad and yet still achieved massive financial success.",Terminator Genisys
515,UtopianUK,Junk for the scrapheap.,1,5 November 2015,"This terrible movie has made me appreciate the original even more. Whereas the original is well-directed, has a tense, clever script, and a well-chosen, enjoyable cast - Genisys is poorly directed, feels far from tense and exciting, has a weak script with atrocious dialogue, and the actors - apart from Arnie - are either weak or miscast.The dialogue shocked me with how poor it was, to the point where I had to laugh at how laughably bad it can be. Jai Courtney was absolutely horrific playing Kyle Reese. Like some meathead wrestler with no acting talent - it was sickening to see after the original actor(Michael Biehn)was so convincing with his brilliant performance. Jason Clarke looked creepy as John Connor, which made the character very off-putting. Then you have the tragically comical casting of Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor. Her baby face and short stature, made her look ridiculous playing a character who was originally played by Linda Hamilton, who is above average height and actually had a toughness about her. Emilia playing such an iconic, tough female character, has to be one of the worst casting decisions ever.So, with a weak, annoying script, a miscast bunch of uninspiring actors, and just an overall air of cheapness, this is, by far, the worst film in the franchise. I wish someone had terminated the script before it was made into this pile of junk.",Terminator Genisys

517,coneill97,An Unnecessary Entry in the Terminator Franchise,4,9 October 2019,"Terminator Genisys, the fifth entry in the Terminator franchise, is a movie that doesn't seem to have a purpose beyond financial motives. It is clear that the filmmakers were inspired by the success of J.J. Abrams ""Star Trek"" and have gone down a similar path of trying to create a film that is both a continuation of the original movies while also being a reboot. Unfortunately, it doesn't work half as well here.One of its main flaws is the fact that it seems to undo the timeline of the two original science-fiction classics in the franchise, a strange choice given their beloved stature among film fans. While it is refreshing initially to revisit iconic scenes from James Cameron's 1984 film, the novelty soon wears off, and it becomes convoluted and tiresome.The best aspect of the movie by far is the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger to the franchise after his omission from the previous instalment. He slips seamlessly back into the role in which he was born to play. He is by far the most likeable member of the cast and brings excellent humour throughout. Emilia Clarke is fine in the role of Sarah Connor but can't match Linda Hamilton's iconic portrayal. The relationship between Sarah and the T-800 is much different in this film to previous entries, with Arnold acting as a father figure. This new dynamic works surprisingly well, however, and is one of the stronger parts of the movie. Jai Courtney is very bland and forgettable as Kyle Reese. He does not come close to the likability that Michael Biehn brought to the role in the original, and the chemistry between himself and Clarke is non-existent.Another major misstep that the film takes is turning John Connor into the villain. It feels like a cheap twist and never really works. Given that the second half of the film revolves around Sarah and Reese trying to kill their son, there is no emotion to be found. It feels like a generic action movie with no stakes, unlike the original two entries in the franchise, which this calls back to far too often, merely reminding the audience how much better those films are.While the majority of the special effects are fine, the de-ageing effects used on Schwarzenegger are less than convincing, with the fight sequence between young and old versions of Arnie feeling like two CGI characters hitting each other.In the end, I was left was wondering what the point of it all was. It didn't add anything new or exciting to the franchise, and it simply made me want to go back to watch Jim Cameron's original films. A post-credit scene is included with the intention of getting the audience excited for another instalment, but after this film, I feel it's time to bring the series to an end.",Terminator Genisys
518,mcgregorrowland,Good but needs a lot of work,6,1 July 2015,"Minor SpoilersLet me start off by saying that if you are not a fan of time travel and it confuses you don't see this movie. If you are not a fan of ""Interstellar"" and ""Xmen Days of Future Past"" this movie is not for you. OK this movie is a mixed bag. Some parts are good and some just make you wanna laugh at the stupidity. First of all the movie is the same exact plot as the other terminators which is: stop Judgement Day. I mean we have seen this over and over again and I would have loved to see something new. Furthermore I don't think the movie did the best job of explaining what was going on. I mean if you really missed something someone said you were just lost. Surprisingly, the action didn't really blow me away (except for the helicopter and bus scenes). A lot of the hand to hand combat and gun fights were stuff we have already scene before in other movies. The one thing that I really did not like was the whole John Connor possession deal. Being my favorite character in the franchise, I hated how they turned the character I was most looking forward to see into a bad guy. But like I said there was some good things. As usual with movies these days, the CGI was incredible. Acting was quite well and I loved Emilia Clarke. I hope she is in more movies to come. Arnold actually did pretty decent for his age and I loved some of the old quotes they put in from the other films and gave you a little giggle. Overall, this pretty much was an action flick that you expected way more from since it was a Terminator film. But I guess you can enjoy watching it if you are just looking to see a decent action movie. But if you are taking this seriously and you expect a lot from it since it is a Terminator film prepare to be disappointed.",Terminator Genisys

The effects fantastic. Casting fantastic. Emilia Clarke, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Clarke and J.K. Simmons are all fantastic in their roles. The action was good and so was the pace, the film never became boring even with how complex the story was so it certainly gets points for that.

520,sentient-74528,They finally lost it,1,6 July 2015,"The Terminator franchise started with a low-budget thriller film that introduced a very interesting and compelling story about a woman who is a target of a ruthless man from the future that turns up to be a cyborg. It was a simple yet good story and a good piece of science fiction. Why was it a good film? Well, for starters, the bad guy, i.e the terminator, according to Kyle Reese, doesn't feel pain or pity, can't be reasoned with, can't be bargained with. It was the perfect killer, and almost invincible. So there you got all the elements of a good story.Then came Terminator 2: Judgement day. Here things start to get weird with the new T-1000, because it was the result of CGI of that time. The whys and hows of the T-1000 were cleverly hidden away and never discussed. The story was good: here Sarah Connor wants to change history and the new terminator ends up showing a window of opportunity.T3 came along and stuff started to crumble. T3 makes no sense. A seemingly old terminator that goes back because a ""more advanced"" (and absurd) terminator came to yet again kill John Connor. They used preposterous ideas justified by the fact that it is a ""fiction"" film (i.e the stuff about controlling automobiles with a ""virus"": cars don't work like that). Well, even fiction must be based on some rules, and T3 simply disregards these rules, and that is what makes it so bad.Salvation came and it was good. Honestly, I don't see why people freak out about Salvation, because it was consistent, it makes actual sense. It looks like a war zone between our present and that future we see in the first films. There are no crazy liquid-metal things this time, only ""normal"" cyborgs and there were very nice references to the first two films. I have no idea why people hate it. It is not a thriller, but action, but then T3 isn't a thriller either, nor is T2, so that is a very bad reason to hate TS.And now came Genisys, with the typo in the name.The film starts with a disturbing change: the judgment day occurred, apparently, in 1997. It means that the whole second film was thrown in the rubbish bin. Sarah's efforts were pointless, apparently Skynet wasn't destroyed after all. But maybe I was confused, so I'll just ignore this and move on.The film introduces an interesting idea: since the future already changed before, Skynet was aware of John's plan to send Kyle Reese and attacks him (John) before he tears the time machine apart, altering the whole story.But this leads to a series of confusing events that end up having a terminator sent to kill Sarah when she was 9 and another to protect her. Then the ""good"" terminator ends up ""raising"" Sarah to have the face of Emilia Clarke instead of Linda Hamilton and both prepare for the arrival of a disturbingly different Kyle Reese in 1984.Then appears the original terminator, apparently unaware it was not the first assigned to kill Sarah, and a T-1000 was apparently sent to kill Kyle (it is never explained who was the target).Then instead of waiting for the right time, Emilia Clarke decides to build a time machine and go to 1997 stop Skynet. But Kyle, as explained by some pseudo-science theory, has memories of an alternate childhood (go figure), and knows Skynet goes berserk in 2017. So they go to 2017 and find out that there is this software which is a mixture of Apple, Google and Facebook called Genisys that for no reason is being used on mobiles, hospitals, and even the army and is going to be ""available"" at precisely the time of judgment day, even though it is already being used.John Connor shows up in 2017 looking like Jason Clarke, and we assume he was cast because he shares the same surname with Emilia, and he is a cyborg because Skynet itself was contained inside a cyborg and it managed to replace every cell in John Connor for nano-technology. He wants to turn his parents into machines and he inexplicably not only defends Skynet, but he created Genisys himself.So John Connor is the bad guy! And he is a terminator who created Skynet! Schwarzenegger tries to kill him, but Sarah points a gun to his... head, and.. it makes no sense.They then invade this company that developed Genisys and end up stumbling on the same computer interface used in Resident Evil: Skynet for some reason has several projectors in the place with the hologram of a child that tries to convince the heroes that they are doomed and you wonder why Skynet wastes time talking to them if it really thinks that, but the holograms make funny noises when they cross the light and you give up trying to understand.In the end Schwarzenegger kills Jason Clarke by getting into this unfinished time-machine with a giant magnet, while Kyle and Sarah explode the building, but in the last second Schwarzenegger falls into the metal goo that would be the T-1000s and even though a T-1000 cannot emulate complex machinery because it has moving parts and all that (check T2), he inexplicably blends just fine with the goo and becomes ""updated"". Oh, that trick is used before too. So even though stuff exploded, the terminator ""survives"".So the film ends leaving a feeling of ""what the hell I just saw"", and I wonder why people find this any better than T3 and why Terminator Salvation is considered worse. It is beyond me. Really people, something is wrong here.So if you like Terminator, go see it. If you liked Salvation, I'm so sorry, but it didn't turn into a trilogy and they just ""terminated"" a good project.",Terminator Genisys
521,TheTerminatorsky,too much techno-babble,7,2 July 2015,"*** HERE BE SPOILERS ***This the most confusing T movie yet thus far!

I mean, really, if you insert 'theoretically' then anything in the world is possible; a meteor could hit Earth and wipe out humanity and then bees or koalas or ants will take over and evolve and built spaceships to colonize the galaxy.1st question: how did the T-800 end up in 1973 when SC was 9? Who sent it, why? Was there an attempt to kill SC when she was 9 by Skynet? How did that T-800 know about what was going to happen in 1984?2nd: why go in the future to 2017? I wasn't clear on that plan. Because KR had a dream as a boy?3rd: So Genisys is some sort of social media program that gives birth to Skynet? Ah, so it ain't a virus no more as in T3, it's now become a sort of 'facebook' archive. Reminded me of that game system Genesis of some 20 years ago. Heck, why couldn't Atari2600 have become Skynet in 1984?4th: Why resurrect an unknown character like O'Brien from T1 instead of once again getting Dr.Silberman in the mix? Is it because the good doc would be like 120, perhaps, but heck would've been funny. 5th: How did JC end up in the past to become a sort of Bill Gates/Zuckerberg figure who runs a company that created this Genisys? So he's been infected by Skynet to (yes, you guess it) create Skynet in the past?Overall, there is just too much going on, too many characters and time-line twists, and is more confusing than 'Time Crimes'; but, yes, it was better than 'Salvation' and somewhat entertaining deserving of a 7/10.PS: When credits roll, about mid-way, there is footage which hints at T6, so don't walk out too quickly. PSS: No, like others I did not like the 'Bad boys' with the mug shots either. PSSS: All rights to Terminator revert back to James Cameron in 2019.

It hurt me, Im genuinely distraught.When I heard they were producing a new Terminator I was apprehensive, what started out as a once great franchise has been marred with misgivings for quite some time but I wanted to believe it could be something again. At the very least I was expecting some thrills and a mildly entertaining action film, what I got was a train wreck of muddled plot points, illogical structures and a complete crumbling of a much beloved film franchise.Im a fan of the Terminator franchise, while 3 and Salvation are often considered pretty dire, I honestly thought thats as low as you could get but this film s*&ts all over those two. It disregards absolutely everything we appreciated about 1 & 2.The whole story is a confused mess and I genuinely found it boring, I love cinema yet I found myself staring at my watch more than once throughout.I am actually in disbelief as to how it's already been commissioned for 2 other films as part of a new trilogy and am shocked that Cameron gave it his blessing. It doesn't make sense to me, not one bit.Im not gonna spoil anything for anyone, all I can say is don't go see it. Wait until its released on DVD or whatever else because you're missing nothing on the big screen and all you are doing is giving money to something that deserves to be forgotten.I don't usually write reviews on IMDb, this is my first I think, at least my first in living memory but I was so outraged by what I've just witnessed that I had to warn you whoever reads this, save you money and 2 plus hours on anything else.1 star is all its getting and thats only because I cant give lower.",Terminator Genisys

524,just_for_movies,"A big, dumb, fun action flick.",8,26 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys is a big, bloated, fun, action-packed summer blockbuster. It boasts entertaining action, lots of CGI, and an interesting yet confusing story/plot. There were some general flaws in the newest addition to the Terminator franchise, but all in all, Genisys was an entertaining ride.The story/plot in Genisys has enormous potential but is weighed down by unnecessary and confusing plot points and time traveling. The premise is an interesting one: a company (called SkyNet) made an app/software program that is apparently very useful for everyone in the world so naturally everyone wants to get it when it's available. The truth is that SkyNet will then destroy the human race once they have this software. The audience sees this destruction early on in the movie and how the remaining humans fight the evil robots. Ultimately, a few folks have to go back in time and destroy the software before it is released to the world. Now, this concept is certainly interesting, but it was executed in such a confusing way that one can't really grasp the details and it's hard to keep up with various things. Naturally, with the confusing plot come many plot holes. And more plot holes. Even with the confusing and complicated plot, it wasn't as confusing as I thought it would be. I understood more of the concept than I thought I would and I certainly though that it was an interesting story. None the less, it was executed in a confusing way that many people might have difficulty understanding.The acting in this movie is decent for the most part. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the Terminator of course and he does it well even though playing a machine is something almost anyone could do. Emilia Clarke plays Sarah Connor and I was skeptical about her but in the end she turned out to be really good. Jason Clarke (who is NOT related Emilia Clarke) plays John Connor and he is another good addition to the cast. The actor that I had some problems with was Jai Courtney. He was very bland in his role and had some potentially comedic moments, but they sort of fell flat. J.K. Simmons was criminally underused but he was still great in his role.Let's talk about the action. This movie is filled to the brim with action sequences. They certainly are entertaining and some will require you to shut off your brain and just enjoy it without thinking ""is that even possible?"". I had great fun with many of the action scenes and while they weren't very revolutionizing or anything, they were still very enjoyable in that dumb but fun way. Along with the action comes a ton of CGI. This movie almost relied a bit too much on CGI but thankfully most of it was good. There were a few CGI shots that could have been improved but generally speaking, it was quite good.Director Alan Taylor has once again proved that while he may not be a great director for story and dialogue, he has an immensely impressive visual style. He also directed Thor: The Dark World and I was very pleased with that film's visuals and so I at least knew that Terminator Genisys would be pleasing to the eye.The score for Genisys is a little generic, but still very fitting to the movie. There were some great pieces for the big action sequences that improved the scene and made it feel epic.In the end, Terminator Genisys has a confusing story/plot and some mediocre acting, but it also has very fun action and generally good CGI. I was impressed with the film's visual style and action which were two things that I really wanted to see from this movie. While it may not be the smartest movie in theaters, it certainly is a fun summer action flick.",Terminator Genisys
525,Joenovak32,"This didn't suck, but...",6,3 July 2015,"I thought this movie wasn't horrible, I just have some problems with it. First what I liked was Sarah Connor, the casting for her was great. I also loved Arnold, he looked like he was having fun and did a good job, and the effects were really cool. There were great things In this movie, but it is not perfect. First of all Kyle Reese being played by Jai Courtney is so dumb, first the Die Hard franchise, and now the Terminator franchise? If I see Jai Courtney in more of my favorite franchises then I will freak out! Why would you cast an actor like him in such an important role? I also am confused by the time line now, there are some holes, like if Sarah and Kyle went to the future before having John, then how could John Connor show up as a terminator in the new time line before he was born? Would he be a lot younger then? Also why not solve the problem faster and show the creator of genisys he would cause the end of the world like the creator of sky net in the second movie? I could go on longer but I don't want to make this longer. The thing I hate the most is that the movie was spoiled by the trailer, people don't think that should matter when it comes to the movie, but this is my opinion on the movie. I say this is more of a 6.5/10, it is a good movie, but it has problems. Also I am not like the critics on rotten tomatoes so don't say I am unfair. I do consider this the third movie in the franchise, because since they changed the time line I can say what did or didn't happen.",Terminator Genisys
526,edyngrn,didn't hate it,6,16 November 2015,"I did not hate it because graphics and the story are good, but I do not like where John Connor is a skynet being now instead of being the rebel who takes it down. Ample movies about protecting the Connors and sending Kyle Reese in the past for a reason, John becomes a advocate for the machines. They could have left that part out. Have the alternate timeline in 84 and do whatever, but leave John to what he is supposed to do, fight machines. I did not hate the movie, just that part.2 actors I like are in it and did a good job. I think Matt Smith looks better with the coif and Clarke as a blond. Getting used to them with their respective character styles, then they play a different role, it's weird because the characters are very iconic. They own the roles of the Doctor and Daenerys.",Terminator Genisys
527,pskachova,"Weak. Miscast actors, dumb messy plot, no chemistry",5,27 July 2021,"The title says all. The two main characters, Sarah and Reese, are miscast in my opinion and they lack any chemistry, they are not credibile as John's parents and lovers. The only great actor is John, and sometimes our good old Terminator.Apart that, the plot is messy, a bit dumb and does not convince.So far, this might be the worst Terminator chapter.",Terminator Genisys
528,Donnie_Quixotic,Genesis of a Terminal Illness,2,10 July 2015,"I lowered my expectations, in the hope that doing so would enable me to enjoy what critics have eloquently described as ""A piece of total and utter sh!t"". So, as instructed by the positive reviewers on this site, I checked my brain at the cinema door, put my dunce cap on, and positively readied myself for some stupid Sci Fi fantasy fun. Of course, a part of me was still secretly hoping the movie would arouse some science fiction excitement worthy of the Terminator franchise... well... the first two movies anyway. I was willing to overlook the rough edges, in the knowledge that only Jim Cameron can top Jim Cameron, and hoping for something Cameron-esque was not being realistic. I would settle for merely ""Okay"" or ""Silly but a great ride"". But nothing could have prepared me for what a monumental piece of total and utter sh!t this movie was... (well nothing but the aforementioned reviews I ignored.) I kid you not, this movie takes Cameron's two 'B' movie masterpieces from 1984 and 1991, orders them to remove their clothes: which are its heart, soul, intelligence, and imagination; puts them in the time machine and transports them to 2015 in the form of Terminator Genisys. I was gobsmacked that Hollywood producers could give such trash the green light before requesting that the script be rewritten, burnt to ashes, rewritten twelve more times with at least one more burning or shredding in between to destroy the taint of the draft they actually ended up shooting... Terminator Degeneratesys... whatever... There's just so many storytelling missteps and dramatic errors, it boggles the mind that a group of apparent professionals wrote, directed, and produced this. It comes across to me as a community channel soap opera with expensive special effects (Community channel because the acting was so amateurish I was left wondering throughout the entire movie whether it was the badly written dialogue or the actors poor delivery that was to blame. I suspect a combination of both, but mainly the writing, which was composed almost entirely of boring expositional dialogue on top of the boring expositional voice-over narration -- what happened to show, don't tell?!). The prologue at the beginning of the film could have served as a few genuine dramatic sequences within the movie: Kyle Reese's first encounter with John Connor as a kid could have been a dramatic event; instead, it, along with other major events, are served up as snippets in a tedious montage, further cheapened by tedious narration alerting us to stuff they could have shown us in entertaining action sequences. There WAS actually a story in this mishmash pile of garbage, but it most certainly wasn't the convoluted snore-fest they served up. I think it was probably the story of Kyle Reese as a kid, and his meeting and alliance with John Connor. Sigh, anyway, it was nice to have Arnie back in the leathers so he could persistently and perpetually parody himself for two hours, while continually reminding us that he's old but not obsolete. ""Huh bad boys, whatcha want, whatcha want, whatcha gonna do when Sheriff John Brown come for you."" It's weird when the ""Cops"" TV show intro music suddenly starts pumping for no apparent reason isn't it? Well that's what happens for about seven seconds, at about the two thirds mark of this movie, so don't be alarmed. It's just that since the beginning of the movie, the director, who obviously was restraining himself from turning the entire movie into a music video clip, briefly lost control of his impulses and started playing random and inappropriate music during scenes. It seems he preferred this over using the Terminator theme music which actually sets the mood and atmosphere of the Terminator films. On a positive note, in 2019 the rights to the Terminator franchise revert back to James Cameron, and who better to provide the salvation it so desperately needs. In 2019 hopefully we'll see ""Terminator Salvation""... or has that already been done...?",Terminator Genisys

For the story, it got me hyped up-- the story is great. Technicalities are great too, Arnold talking about some quantum and about time traveling, explaining how it works. About the story, yup people are expecting something new-- which happened at the first quarter of the film... 'til New John revealed his new objective. That's when the rate keeps on going down.

Can't ask more from the Xth episode in a franchise.I look forward to what they will bring next, though I doubt the Arnold will be a significant player. :(I'm sure since there is money to be made they will follow this with another...I only hope it is as entertaining.",Terminator Genisys

Only other time that has happened was after the original Matrix, and I suspect many Scifi fans feel similarly about these two classic movies.I was sorely disappointed after T3 and T4, which were decent popcorn movies but nothing approaching the classics. Genisys is not quite a classic but a far better movie than T3 and T4, and what's bittersweet is how a different casting decision for Reese could have pulled this movie into greatness. This casting decision cost the movie the sorely needed chemistry between Reese and Connor and the much needed desperate intensity. Arnold did what Arnold does best, which isn't a bad thing. The plot holes...well, this is a scifi movie, isn't it? I would buy a 3-movie bluray director's cut bundle for T1,T2, and Genisys.",Terminator Genisys
532,natcarr-74-27114,If you don't take it seriously then you'll enjoy it more.,8,1 April 2016,"So is the new Arnie Terminator movie as good as T2? Ha! C'mon. Someone is imposing some near impossible standards to live up to right from the start folks. Let's be realistic here. If you sit down to watch this movie with impossibly high expectations then you must be a masochist of some kind. T2 had never-before-seen special effects, a Hollywood Star at the peak of his popularity, a very well written script, and one of the best sci-fy movie directors in Hollywood at the helm. So please let's be a bit sensible here. Let's treat this movie as a trip to one of your favourite movie franchise universes, a bit like those Matrix animated shorts that were included in the DVD box set about ten years ago. If you do then you'll have fun. I enjoyed Jurassic World for the same reasons. Dinosaurs eat people in cool ways, what's not to like? So what's great about this movie? 1, Arnie. Obviously. watching his character try to smile is hilarious. And if you don't think there should be humour in a terminator movie then you probably didn't like the Star Wars re-boot either. Let face it Arnie as the terminator is the reason for watching this instalment and he carries the movie well. Very charismatic. The father daughter dynamic between the terminator and Sarah Connor is a nice touch and makes both characters very likable and you care about Sarah at least. You can't feel THAT attached to a robot. ...Its a robot.2, Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor - Emilia also does a brilliant job of bringing a tough, capable but more mentally healthy Sarah Connor to the screen. She isn't as damaged as Linda Hamilton was in T2 but instead she is a fairly believable and very likable character. I think sometimes movies make female action characters too strong. Its hard to believe in a 5ft something woman beating up four 6ft3 blokes like Resident Evil. but you can have smart resourceful athletic female characters who can hold their own without out muscling grown men and the script writers do a good job of nailing a believable heroine.What is okay? Karl Reese:- Bit underdone and he comes over as a bit lost and always out of his depth. A part of that is understandable given his character's story arc, and also Arnie and Amelia need their hero moments. I think he gets away with being a bit of a follower because Reese is just a soldier following orders in the original movie too. The mission is everything, right? He's a infantry grunt, indoctrinated to follow orders, not to think.What's bad? The villain. Don't want to give anything away but maybe this is why terminator movies are struggling to live up to the earlier movies in many peoples eyes. Where do you go next to top the last super terminator killing machine? The villain in this movie just smacks of desperation. One of the coolest ways to amp up a classic battle that I've ever seen was in Peter Jacksons King Kong where Kong takes on three T-Rexes! Its really simple but why not show Arnie, Karl and Sarah work together to take out a terminator kill squad? The script writers just tied their brains into knots in this movie. trying to be too clever for their own good.lack of quality blood spatter. Hey, I'm a product of the 80's. Total Recall and Robocop rule. I want some red stuff painting the walls! To be fair the violence was also toned down in T2. (Didn't like it then either though).I recommend this movie. Better than T3. Better than every Transformers movie ever made. Pretty much on par with the Jurassic World re-boot. Enjoy. If I got the Blu-ray for Christmas or my birthday I wouldn't be upset. If I saw it in the bargain bucket in town I'd be tempted to buy it.",Terminator Genisys
533,Jason_VoorheesIMDb,Almost as good as Terminator 2.,10,10 July 2015,"I just saw this movie yesterday with my grandfather and we were both looking forward to this and even though the trailer gave away the HUGE spoiler with John Connor I still was looking forward to it and I was not disappointed. This is my 2nd favorite Terminator movie with my favorite being the 2nd one. And I personally like all the Terminator movies and the only thing I disliked about this is that Matt Smith was only in the movie for maybe a total of 5-10 MINUTES! What the hell? He was my favorite Doctor in Doctor Who and when I heard he was gonna be in this I was super hyped just for him. Aside from that the movie was great. The movie even throws humor into it at the right moments like there was this parts where Sarah and Kyle are getting ready to use her time machine and of course they had to remove their clothes and Arnie asks Sarah did you mate and the audience in the theater laughed their heads off. Anyway the movie has great acting, great action scenes, it's funny at the right moments like I said, and the T-1000 was another thing about this that was heavily promoted and while he was in a good chunk of the movie he was a little underused. If you're a Terminator fan give this movie a try. If you're not a Terminator fan skip this. And one more spoiler by the end of the movie Arnold is upgraded to a T-1000 himself. Since I don't really have much more to say I'll do what I did with my Terminator 2 review and list my 10 favorite moments. 10. The beginning of the movie (great way to start this off) 9. The scene where the current Arnold and the younger Arnold fight. 8. The scene at the hospital after Kyle and Sarah use the time machine. 7. The scene where Sarah, Kyle and John are in the bus on the golden gate bridge. 6. Sarah and Arnold save Kyle Reese from the T-1000. 5. The ending. (Great way to end the movie and set up the next one and a great piece of humor in the scene) 4. The helicopter chase. 3. John Connor finds Kyle and Sarah while they prepare to destroy Skynet. 2. The T-1000 finds Sarah, Kyle and Arnold in the sewers. 1. The final showdown in Cyberdyne. The action in this scene is fantastic and is where we FINALLY see Matt Smith back in the movie for only a few minutes but still better than nothing. And everything about this final showdown was awesome. And thankfully I hear Matt Smith will play a bigger part in the next two sequels. My final verdict: 9.6 out of 10.",Terminator Genisys
534,jakobgf-95,It's okay,4,11 July 2015,"Before i start i want to say that i really enjoyed this movie despite the fact that it has a few flaws. One of the biggest ones, obviously, being the story. Now, time travel stories do not make much sense to begin with, but there are a few works of fictional media out there that handle the subject much better than others, for example T2. But in TG it almost never makes sense and it's incredibly distracting. But at least the characters aren't so poorly written and there are a few good lines of dialogue here and there. I would say that the characters have chemistry, if the directing wasn't so awful. The best acting performance in this movie is average at best and Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't even the worst one in this. I think that she gives usually a good performance but Emilia Clarke isn't good at all in this. I personally believe, as i said, that this is the fault of the director. In almost every scene he seems to have forgotten how to do his job and just focused on Emilia Clarke's breasts rather than her acting. I also think that she looks a bit too young for the role of Sarah Connor. There are a few really annoying slow motion shots in the film which try to incorporate the 3D but it was just boring and the 3D was, of course, total crap.The score is also disappointing. There are a few really good tracks in it but, especially during the action sequences, it is extremely generic and boring. But the action itself is well done.There are a few failed attempts of social criticism and they are really cheap and being the big budget summer blockbuster that it is, they just have to blow up a computer generated American city and that is really lame.But there is some good stuff too. As said before, the action is great especially because of the use of a lot of practical effects which i really appreciate. I also loved the way they recreated a few scenes from the first Termitor film in almost every detail which is very cool.And i, personally, really liked the pacing of this movie. The movie still takes it's time for every event and i think it's the strongest part of the film. The characters are passably developed and it never felt too long or too short. In between the action, there are sometimes a few funny character scenes which are enjoyable but i think they would work way better if the whole movie wouldn't take itself so seriously which eventually is it's biggest drawback.Other than that there is nothing else worth mentioning. In the end, i would say that you can definitely enjoy this film if you're willing to forgive it for some of the rough edges and appreciate the stuff that's well done. It feels exactly like what it is. A Terminator movie from 2015.",Terminator Genisys
535,SteveFOX_86,Terminator:Damnation or Kingdom of the Terminator Crystal Skulls,3,2 July 2015,"I watched all four previous Terminator movies this month just to get into the mood, and see how the old movies held up. The masterpieces Terminator 1 and 2, and their unwanted offspring Rise of the Machines and Salvation. While Rise of the Machines and Salvation had weak points they were definitely good-OK movies, just not great, this movie however besides having Arnold in shape and being great in character have absolutely no redeeming qualities. It's like Indiana Jones 4, I'm just gonna treat it as it never existed. And like Indiana Jones 4 the problem was not that Arnold/Ford was old, but because the movie was a complete disaster in every other way apart from FORD/ARNOLD portraying faithfully their best roles. If the last Terminator title was Salvation, this one is the series Damnation. Melting the franchise to a teen popcorn flick with daddy issues. Here is the breakdown: First act of the movie is good, starts strong and we get to see how Kyle Reese was actually sent back through time. After which this movie completely falls apart from logic, sense and plot. What plot? Whoever says we need an actual meaningful plot and motivation to drive the characters? Well, I say. If Rise of the Machines and Salvation had plot holes, this one has plot CANYONS. Absolutely nothing that is happening on screen has any logic, merit and the characters have absolutely no real motivation besides keeping this train-wreck to reach it's ending.It's just one action set to another, with meaningless Terminator battles and explosions with rehashed dialogue lines and set pieces. Characters have absolutely no chemistry together, the screenwriter who wrote this clearly does not know what it means to fall in love or to lose someone you love, how to write a strong leading male or female character, let alone have them bond and form some kind of relationship. Nope, relationship is there because I say it's there, these two people must like each other so that the plot advanced and while I'm at it lets throw some more meaningless characters that you've probably heard of from before that have absolutely nothing to give to the plot or to the story. There are no more twists, that they did not show in the trailers and then you get to the ending. And my God the ending is so loud, dumb and predictable, you'll laugh.Here's my verdict on the actors performances for each role: Jai Courtney is a pumped wooden stick that could not act drama if his life depended on it. Emilia Clarke has no idea what it's like to be a soldier or how to portray one, doesn't evolve the character of Sarrah Connor, in fact it degrades her to a shallow, indecisive brat who never had me believing for a minute she was the mother of the future or the leader of the future. Jason Clarke is a fine actor that was simply thrown into this chaotic mix with perhaps little to do besides being the laughable clichéd comic book villain this movie did not need, all his attempts to portray some kind of complex character fail because the characters are written so one dimensional. Then we get to Arnold who did almost the impossible and build his physique and checked his emotions so that he could once again be the Terminator, but all that he can do is simply hold this movie like duct tape and bubblegum to break to pieces after the 30th minute.My final rating is 5/10. That's because I saw it on IMAX and Arnold was great, and the first half was tolerable and somewhat interesting, but that was a false promise. If you wanna see a good Terminator movie, watch T1,2,3,4. After this you'll think that T3 and T:S are Oscar worthy.",Terminator Genisys
536,WinstonNoCGI,"This flick should have been called ""Terminator GenderSys""",3,1 August 2015,"While watching the movie I couldn't decide whether I accidentally entered a Rosamunde Pilcher movie or Lifetime/Sixx TV show.There was too much talking, too many discussions about love, too many dreams of living in a beloved family, too much trying to be funny.There wasn't even a single gory scene in the movie. The most gory scene was seeing the Terminators skeleton arm (yes, once again... gee).Basically this movie is just a 1:1 rerun of the most catchy T1 and T2 scenes, plus pointlessly shooting magazines empty on robots plus a number of discussions about love, family and hate. Who on earth targeted this flick for being rated for children of 12 years old?The musical score was so boring and timid that I believed to feel a breeze of fresh ""Breathe Happy"" while it played.The most disgusting part of the movie plot was that the chick is plotted to be the only hero - even the Terminator is just some funny sidekick supporting the chick. ... Maybe I'm too old for this. I just can't stand seeing a tank-like fighting robot and an experienced marine-like warrior to be bullied by some little chick throughout a whole action flick. Younger viewers may find this attractive, perhaps. But, hey, the cinema was filled with 99% men. What in heaven did the writers of the plot believe to aim at?Suspense ... No, I don't think so. Terminators have been depicted as being some shining metal things shooting around as soon as they enter the room. There were just too many of them and they've been too occupied in shootouts to be menacing. (Though shooting always did pause while children where around.) That's all there is to it.Fighting ... There was no fighting. Only some shoving around and ludicrous emptying of gun magazines.Schwarzenegger wasn't menacing. He wasn't funny, too (and he shouldn't try to be). I can't believe people still feel joyful hearing him repeating his same old quotes over and over again. Hey, his text made sense in the original flick, but it just DOESN'T MAKE SENSE NOW. His quotes just are trite.Well, OK, there were some good parts in the flick:The CGI 3D model of the younger Schwarzenegger was remarkable. You could hardly tell the difference.

It started well, even though the Reese actor is nothing like the enigmatic Bale. The freakily sized biceps had us wondering how on earth he'd managed to get a shirt or jacket to fit them. His acting was abysmal. I hated the product placement of the nike training shoes (apparently viewers would have pointed out if the shoes were wrong ..... really? I think not, I mean who cares?).Despite Sarah Connor having several years to train for this day - she was a little dumpy and unfit, again no Linda Hamilton.We are now told the terminator machine came to Sarah when she was seven, yet she wasn't aware of them in the original film until told about them - I gave up trying to fathom things out as apparently the reason for changes in original storyline are put down to a blip in the time machine making changes. Lazy way to change the course of history in the film. Oh well. Just sit back enjoy the constant hitting, fighting, the getting up again and continuing the fight, blasts, very thin walls being pushed through and vending machine toppled over.I gave up before the end.

541,Placiddragon,What were they thinking...,3,3 November 2015,"I'll try to keep the spoilers general and avoid specifics.So, the premise of the Terminator plot is getting fairly well known as we are in the fifth iteration of the franchise.Genisys puts a slightly different spin on it, unfortunately without it improving the story. If anything, it just makes things worse.While i am generally happy with the CGI (most was good, some was OK, some was downright bad), i found much of the cinematography and sound downright distracting.. it was loud and flashy just because, which i found an overall detriment to the quality of the movie.Genisys's biggest problem is without question its story. It is a mess, so massively convoluted and downright stupid at times that if you even begin to try to pick it apart, there are plot holes big enough to drive a battleship through.This is a rather critical problem, as if the story isn't at least passable, chances are the movie is going to fall flat even if you have Oscar material actors.These actors are NOT Oscar material, which compounds the story problem. The only actor i'd give a pass is Arnold, the rest are sub par.. well, except for Jai Courtney and Emilia Clarke which are both downright abysmal.I find it impossible to recommend this movie to anyone, and for people who has seen the earlier Terminator movies, my only recommendation would be to stay well clear of this abomination of a movie..",Terminator Genisys
542,tim-vanlaere,A nice action flick,8,6 July 2015,"What a difficult task to make Terminator relevant today and not upset the fans of the classic movies. With the current trend to make a ""remake of everything"", having incompetent and soulless directors getting their greedy hands on and horrendously failing - it was refreshing to see the effort that went to steer away from making the same mistakes. And not get seduced to ""overdo"" the whole thing with GUI and over the top-ness. It stayed quite true to the universe and cinemagraphic style.While it hasn't the same punch or impact as the two original films have and there are many references to the previous movies younger movie- goërs might not really get, it has been a pleasure to submerge again in the Terminator universe which craftfully stands on it own.",Terminator Genisys
543,dekadent,Awful,1,12 October 2015,"It's no secret all Terminator movies after the second one stink to high heaven. Large studios keep disregarding one of the main rules of movie physics - when you remove the original director form a decent franchise, you destroy it. Alien franchise is a great example of this, after Aliens all Alien movies were mediocre at best until original director again took over his creation. With that being said, Terminator Salvation still sets a new record of how idiotic things can become when this rule is violated. This movie is bad. Plot is dumb and clichéd.

The script ruins whatever chance the movie had. It is that basic corner stones the whole plot relies upon are laughingly implausible.So there is no good story, mediocre action from most of the main actors, so-so action and dumb final scenes.My vote of 5/10 goes to Schwarzenegger.

You need to just enjoy it, and I enjoyed it very much. The best thing about Terminator Genisys is the action sequences which are exciting and well edited, and aren't shaky-cam mad like Transformers. It makes it exhilarating and thee bus flip scene is particularly impressive. The acting doesn't feel wooden and Emilia Clarke does a great job as Sarah Connor. I thought however that J.K Simmons and Matt Smith didn't get enough screen time, so the film did them no justice. I liked the score too.The main central problem with Terminator Genisys is the plot. It felt convoluted and rushed and to be honest made minimal sense. Too much is not explained in the film and you end up thinking ""What does that mean?"" and ""How is that possible?."" None of this is helped by Arnie's techno babble, which does the film no good. The script was actually pretty solid apart from the babble.Overall, then, I really enjoyed it but the plot needed to be simpler.

So Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines happened and it was terrible and what's worse: completely unnecessary. So you would be surprised that a fourth Terminator (Terminator: Salvation) was greenlit, and unfortunately it was terrible as well. So when we come to Terminator: Genisys, you don't see the point in franchise anymore. Clearly the studio prepped up a negative response to where the franchise had been headed, so they take advantage of time traveling and try to change the whole story of the whole franchise, but instead of helping reboot the franchise it simply makes us shake our heads.Terminator: Genisys picks up before the events of the first film (Terminator of 1984) take place. In the post-apocalyptic world, the war of humans vs. machines is nearly over and John Connor (Jason Clarke) is leading the human side to victory. However, he finds out that the machines (led by the computer program Skynet) have sent a killer robot (Terminator) to murder John's mother: Sarah Connor (Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke) before John is even born. So John sends one of his best men, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney), to stop the Terminator from murdering his mother. BUT there is a twist in this part of the story. Apparently when Reese arrives, the Terminator sent back has already been ""taken care of"" by Sarah Connor and another Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who an unknown person from the future sent to protect Sarah. However, there is still a T-1000 liquid robot (which has the exact same visual effect quality as the T-1000 in 1992's T2) after them, plus there is a whole lot of time travelling left to do.The bad thing is that the film tries to be smart and thinks it achieves it. Unfortunately there are so many illogical problems and paradoxes regarding time travel that I would think it unfair to count it when rating the film. The writers didn't seem to have mapped out the time travelling aspects at all; they were too focused on creating new one-liners and fitting explosions into the story.I think that another big problem in the film is the casting. Now the biggest challenges in the cast were probably John and Sarah Connor, since they are the most charismatic and iconic characters of the franchise, and in that aspect I feel that the respective actors (Jason and Emilia Clarke – no relation) did a fine job; they clearly tried very hard to avoid previous actors' shadows and they ended up succeeding. However, we need to talk about Jai Courtney. Courtney plays Kyle Reese; a role which Michael Biehn brought to life incredibly well in Terminator; so well that he made Reese an omnipresent character even after he disappears from the next two Terminator films. But Jai Courtney not only failed to rise to Biehn's status, he completely flopped in every aspect of acting. Now I don't normally like to shame on actors like this, but Courtney felt: as if he was being fed lines between the edits of the scene, he didn't seem to understand what he was saying, no one bought his reactions, and his chemistry with every other actor was invisible (and this is surprising since he is a couple with Emilia Clarke and she plays his love interest in this film). So unfortunately Courtney ruined most of the scenes he was in, which were practically all of them (he's the narrator). We also have a supporting cast, which seemed to be ignored on purpose. J.K. Simmons, the Oscar-winning actor was given a role so small, that if you blink you might miss it. And then you have the Doctor Who alum Matt Smith, who was a big part in the marketing of the film, but he ends up getting seconds of screen time (I'm totally serious, count it if you go see this film: he doesn't reach a minute on the screen).The only thing that worked in this film was what has always worked in the other Terminator films: ""Ah-nuld."" Arnold Schwarzenegger is a better actor than most people credit him for. Of course I can't really judge him in this film since he's been playing this role for over 30 years, but he's had some nice turns in indie films like the recent Maggie and if we look even farther back he succeeded in Total Recall and even had a comedic turn in True Lies. Anyways, Schwarzenegger gives his Terminator an emotional battle to deal with. He teases the audience as we see him struggle to comprehend if he is actually experiencing emotion as a machine. He certainly displays more emotion than Jai Courtney. Schwarzenegger also brilliantly delivers his burnt out lines: ""Get out"" and ""I'll be back,"" and adds a bit of sarcasm to his role that relieves the audience with some humor. Essentially he is the only actor who truly understands this film and gives it his all.Overall the film is carried on the shoulders of Schwarzenegger, and even so that is not enough. The film ends up being another typical blockbuster that will probably be forgotten in a few days. If you do end up seeing it, just try to forget that it's connected to the first two Terminator films, out of respect.",Terminator Genisys
548,bozabozidar,Terminator Genisys review,5,8 July 2015,"The recent Terminator craze greatly affected me, since I have always been a huge fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger and the first two Terminator movies. Several days before the release of the new Terminator film, I rewatched all the other installments in the franchise. I wanted very badly to watch Genisys, but my expectations about the movie were very low due to horrible trailers. The final result is a movie with a huge budget (unlike the first part) that has numerous problems, mostly related to its plot.I do not want to spoil the story, although the trailers have already done that, but I must say that there is absolutely no explanation for most of the events in the movie. For example, it is never explained why and how the T-800 traveled back in time when Sarah Connor was a child or who sent him. Additionally, the whole ""alternative timeline"" thing makes no sense and is just used as a bad excuse to make this movie. T-800 says that this is due to some kind of ""nexus"", but that is clearly just some random word the writers made up.The acting in this movie is quite mediocre, whereas Terminator 1 and 2 were praised for great performances. Jai Courtney, who plays Kyle Reese, is very bad in his role and shows no emotions. Emilia Clarke was adequate in Game of Thrones, but she is terrible as Sarah Connor and just watching her is very unpleasant. Arnold Schwarzenegger is alright as the legendary T-800, but he can't really achieve much with the bad script. Byung-hun Lee is the T-1000, but his part is relatively short and could have been better. Jason Clarke is rather unusual as John Connor, and it is interesting to see his behavior change throughout the movie. J. K. Simmons plays the character of an ordinary cop whom Sarah Connor accidentally saves from the T-1000, so he spends decades investigating this case. However, his role is very small and he has absolutely no effect on the events of the film, since he just runs around and shouts in a couple of scenes, so I wonder why anybody bothered even to put him in the movie.Of course, I must mention one of the highlights of the film - the CGI version of young T- 800. It looks astonishing, with a face that completely resembles that of Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1984. Too bad other special effects in the movie are no better than those in Terminator 2, which came out more than 20 years ago. The movie is supposed to be happening during 3 time periods, but most of the scenes from 1984 take place in some old shabby building and not in public places. So the majority of the movie is set in 2017, which of course looks like present day. The action scenes are very generic and forgettable, so there is not much to say about them. Everything is full of CGI explosions, but there is no blood or gore. During intense moments, characters often say memorable lines of other characters from previous movies. For example, T-800 falls on a moving police car and and tells the policeman to ""Get out!"" which is what T-1000 said to a police pilot in T2.In the end, I must say that the original Terminator is a real masterpiece that James Cameron managed to make with limited resources. The new Terminator Genisys had a huge budget and numerous fans of the franchise, but it is inferior to the original in almost every way. Genisys is not completely unwatchable, but it's just a mediocre summer blockbuster with a story that's impossible to understand.",Terminator Genisys
549,sebbystone1,The best installment since the turn of the century.,4,12 August 2015,"While not to the standard of the original, nor of judgment day, Genisys is certainly better than rise of the machines or salvation. With some decent action and effects, and some great actors (Emilia Clarke, Jason Clarke, J.K Simmons, Matt Smith, and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger) Genysis is probably the most underrated entry (at least from the view of critics) in the series. The film presents some big twists such as alternate time lines, and while some things are hard to swallow and some things go unexplained, Genisys does hold together if you cut your brain out for two hours. Wry humour and some originality (take that T3) keep you interested, and overall it makes for a pleasant experience. Terminator and Terminator 2 are much better; this James Cameron approved entry to the series should be seen more as a spin off, a possibility, rather than a sequel. But it works, and I'm glad that they were finally able to put a better than average entry into the 21st century.",Terminator Genisys
550,callmeaman,A Great Reboot,10,24 October 2015,"I was surprised when I got to know there was a reboot of the Terminator Franchise. I expected the film to be a failure, since it was a reboot Alas, I was wrong ! The movie lived up to my expectations.The Graphics in the movie were up to the mark. Arnold Schwarzenegger was just amazing ! His sturdy look, well built body was just the characteristics you need for a Terminator. His acting was very good. His sarcasm is so good that , lol, no one can argue with him.Emily Clarke did a very good job in portraying Sarah O Conner. Jai Courtney who played as Kyle Reese acted pretty good. And even other actors in the cast acted pretty good. So, this movie will truly amaze you. The excitement,actions, suspense and last but not the least Arnold Schwarzenegger will stupefy you !",Terminator Genisys

552,kingdaviduk,"Great movie, loved it, very imaginative storyline",10,16 February 2016,"Great film, really enjoyed it. The acting was great, Arnie was on top form, and the new Sarah Connor was great. If you liked the original Terminator films and the Matrix, you will love this. I also liked Matt Smith's role as Skynet (he used to play the Doctor in Doctor Who). Do not read on unless you have seen it or want to know what happens, because the rest of this review contains spoilers.SPOILERS What an amazing sequel to the original Terminator films. I wondered how they could make it work, an alternate timeline that gives us a very different world, one where Skynet gets pushed back yet again. So now we more time travel, more of Arnie's good Terminator, shape-shifting terminators, and a history that is re-written with a few things the same, but much has changed, so that we now have a different storyline, but still the same story of mankind's survival against being destroyed by the machines. When it came to the end, I wondered how will the Matrix occur now? (The original story was written by a woman in America who wrote the Terminator and the Matrix as one story called The Third Eye.) When you get the final credits, keep watching for the twist at the end that would still make the Matrix a possibility. The machines never will give up trying to kill or enslave mankind. Much of the storyline is a warning to us today. We rely too much on being interconnected and online, putting everything online is not good, especially if Skynet/Genisys were to become a reality.",Terminator Genisys
553,tlettl83,Emotionless,5,17 July 2015,"I will say this is better then T3 and T4. However it does not hold up against T1 and T2. Before you see this movie, you have to ask yourself, what expectation do you have for T5. If you want a redeemer and see a good sequel for T2, you will be disappointed. Do you want to spend 2 senseless hours in-front of a big screen, you will have a descent time.I liked the beginning, which shows a time line where sky-net started to blow up humanity in 1997. They pictured the future very well. We finally see how people get send back in time. I had no problem with most of the casting and acting in this movie. Emilia Clarke was a good Sarah Connor. Jai Courtney was alright as Kyle Reese. i don't think he did a bad job. I really liked Jason Clarke as John Connor. I remember the young John from T2 and he was fun and cocky. I could see this in this future adaptation of John.The problems in this movie is the plot holes, the cliché forced love scene (wich they themselves point out as being stupid during the movie), and sometimes bad chemistry between the leads. ¨ My biggest problem with this movie is Arnold Schwarzenegger and everything around his character. It was PAINFUL at times. Not funny, not catchy, not clever. Just embarrassing, shameful, pointless, emotionless. Arnold's one-liners where painfully bad. ""old, not obsolete"". ""Not dead, upgraded"". There was no terminator learning humans emotions threw Arnold's body. It was a old man trying to play something he is not. In the end, when you add the finale, the characters, the message, you get only 1 word in your mind: Emotionless.",Terminator Genisys
554,lexxtoronto,I'm giving it an 8 just because of Arnold,8,3 July 2015,"Arnold was the only character who made this movie watchable. Imagine this movie without him. Imagined? Now smell the air, it smells like a huge steaming pile of something. I'm really disappointed in the cast and casting, I don't blame the actors, I blame the director. Sara Connor was played awfully, Jason Clarke was a little bit better and Jai Courtney was somewhere in between. Lack of facial expressions, poor dialogues, same old stunts and special effects. Thank you Arnold for keeping this movie alive!",Terminator Genisys
555,worldofshrimpy,Good movie for Terminator fans,5,18 April 2016,"I myself am not a terminator fan, there are many people who grew up watching this movie. I was not one of them. I would say that this movie is a great installment of the trilogy but just was not for me.I found this movie to be very entertaining and well made overall. There are a lot of funny Schwarzenegger moments throughout which I enjoyed. The story on the other hand I found to be a bit confusing, probably because I have only watched the previous ones once. Non the less, it is a great movie. Defiantly one for the fans to watch.The acting in this movie is great. Congratulations to the fight scenes between terminators, making these actors feel like you are watching 2 robots fight, you forget that they are actual people. Once again an outstanding performance by Schwarzenegger!",Terminator Genisys
556,petdavies,Say what now??,4,14 August 2021,Soooo much is wrong with this film. Why send back Kyle on the same day as Arnie and not the day before to blow up Arnie when he arrives. Why does Matt smith kill John Connor in front of Kyle before he time hops and not just wait til he's time hopped. Everyone in this film is totally stupid. Don't bother. It's tripe and makes little to no sense.,Terminator Genisys
557,amatheou-86539,Better than expected,6,8 October 2021,"After the pretty crappy fourth instalment with Christian Bale this in my opinion was a much better movie and a modest return to the vibe of the earlier movies. Plenty of harsh reviews which are way OTT, and yes the plot is incomprehensible, but the mumbo jumbo dialogue kinda gives it a fun feel. Arnie as always a legend, and his character works well in the context of the movie, the two leads do a capable job as well. The movie is really well paced and the 2 hours fly by, the main let down are the repetitive shape shifting fight scenes which always end the same way and have been already done to death. It gets a 6 as it failed to capture anything new and relied way too much on the existing formula, however it's a stylishly made movie, the CGI is bearable, there are some funny Arnie moments and most importantly enjoyable.",Terminator Genisys
558,toronto_ghostbuster,"If you value respectable acting, pass on this one.",3,1 July 2015,"I have 4 personal grades of acting. The first is laughably bad, the second is noticeably bad, the third is natural, and the fourth is noticeably outstanding. Generally, this movie has noticeably bad acting, and above all else, it ruined the movie for me. I get it, it's a blockbuster action movie. It's not supposed to have Oscar worthy performances. I agree, but would you call the acting in the first, second, possibly even the fourth instalment Oscar worthy? No, the acting in those movies were so natural that you didn't ever say ""Wow, that's bad acting"". The actors in those movies did their jobs. They played their parts in a way where you didn't question why they were cast. You didn't even think about casting at all because you were in the movie. You were emotionally invested (at least for the first two).Enter Terminator Genisys. Now, I could break down the flaws in the plot, and of each character in the movie which besides JK Simons and Lee Byung‑hun, there are many, but i'm going to zero my critical laser pointer in on one actor in particular. Can you guess who??? You guessed it...Jai Courney... Oh. My. Goodness. For the life of me, I can not understand how he managed to impress anyone enough to land the role of Kyle Reese. What were they thinking? In my opinion, he single handedly destroyed this film. Sure the plot was messy and had a few holes, but from beginning to end his acting was amateur at best, even worse than that is the fact that he appears on screen for at least 90% of the film. Now, this point may be personal but I don't find him to be particularly charming or likable at all. He is bland. He's like a poor man's Sam Worthington, who is himself not terribly good. Jai Courtney does not belong in a blockbuster movie. He belongs in a direct to VOD sequel, and i'm sure after reading this review and then seeing the movie, you will agree. To be honest, and I know this is going to anger all of the game of thrones fans, Emilia Clarke, who plays Sarah Conner, wasn't much better. She certainly nailed the look of Sarah, however Her accent clearly got in the way of her natural acting abilities as some of her words were noticeably slurred and others seemed more like she was mumbling them under her breath. On top of that she had to work alongside Jai Courtney which made any attempt at being edgy or emotional even more noticeably unnatural due to his flat counter performance. I probably should mention Jason Clarke as well, who played the role of John Conner...He was...There. That's about all can say...Although not the terrible actor that Jai Courtney is, he was equally as forgettable. Not likable, or dislikeable, and considering his role in this film, that's the last thing he should have been! Last but certainly not least, there is Arnold. The Terminator. He pretty much knocked it out of the park, with my only real complaint being 5-10 too many jokes. At times I could not tell if he was a T- 800, or a stand up comedian. I'm sure it wasn't his fault, but I really do wish they would have made him a little more serious.As far as the actual plot and pace of the movie is concerned, all I will say is this. They did not do enough ground work to get the audience to really care. As bad as the acting was, even if it had been great the movie itself wouldn't have been because it was all recycled. It was much closer to a Michael Bay film, than a James Cameron film. Too much action and not enough compelling story. Confusing plot aside (Please see other reviews about that), this movie is missing two things which are essential and that not even dozens of nods to the original could have replaced. It's missing that feeling of real life dread and horror which the first two had, and even more than that, it's missing the likable characters which make a movie memorable, enjoyable and believable. I was not emotionally invested in pretty much any of it and was fairly disappointed overall.",Terminator Genisys
559,ingobert,interesting continuation of the entire Terminator story,7,14 August 2021,"It is certainly not a cinematic masterpiece, but definitely better than parts 3 and 4. The plot is an elegant as well as an interesting continuation of the entire Terminator story, which ultimately revolves around time travel. The aging Schwarzenegger's inclusion in the story isn't that bad either. In addition, successful visual effects and computer animations.Original:Es ist zwar sicherlich kein filmisches Meisterwerk, aber definitiv besser als Teil 3 und 4. Die Handlung ist eine elegante sowohl als auch interessante Fortführung der ganzen Terminator-Geschichte, die sich ja letztlich im Kern um Zeitreise dreht. Auch die Einbindung des gealterten Schwarzenegger in die Geschichte ist nicht so schlecht. Zudem gelungene visuelle Effekte und Computeranimationen.",Terminator Genisys
560,ozzy_in_uk,Terminator meets Back to the Future meets Cocoon,6,7 July 2015,"I'm a huge fan of the Terminator franchise. The original is rightly considered a classic, albeit a somewhat dated one now, with electrifying performances from the main cast. The second installment raised the bar in terms of special effects, delivering one of the biggest box off hits of the 90's. The third episode, I thought, rounded things out quite nicely, ending in a very un-Hollywood fashion. Terminator Salvation also had merit, anchored by Christian Bale, and well supported by an excellent cast, although Arnie was missing, instead being the Governator of California. Last night, some 31 years after originally seeing the first Terminator, I revisited an old friend, it seemed, and for the most part, did enjoy the experience.Starting in 2029, the resistance are on the verge of victory, as Skynet use their secret time weapon to send back a T-800 to 1984 in order to kill Sarah Conner. Kyle Reece is sent back, just before Skynet appears to regain control of things before the resistance can destroy the time machine. In 1984, Reece discovers that Sarah knows everything, having been raised by a guardian T-800 who was sent to 1973 to protect her as a child from presumably another T-800 sent by Skynet. Of course we don't see any of that, leaving the audience to wonder how and when that took place, and whether or not we've possibly missed seeing a film somewhere along the way. Anyhoo, there's the obligatory chase scene, involving a really cool T-1000, who just happened to be in 1984, supposedly sent by Skynet, as back up for the T-800, I guess. Then we learn that the guardian T-800 has built his own time machine, using what materials we do not know (perhaps in the movie we all seemed to have missed, the Starship Enterprise visits 1973 and Arnie out.) Reece then convinces Sarah that they actually need to travel to 2017 rather than 1997 in order to stop Skynet, based on the sudden occurrence of false memories he starts to have upon arriving in 1984. So that's what they do, running into a newer model of Terminator with a twist, with all the usual chases, explosions and coming back from the dead in order to save the day. What works in this movie is the slick presentation, the special effects, and Arnie. The opening sequences, the first being set in 2029 and the second in 1984, work well. I was really impressed with the Korean actor who was the T-1000, whom wasn't in the film nearly long enough. I did like the twist of the time line being changed, effectively transforming the 1984 Sarah Conner into the 1994 version, although the grittiness that Linda Hamilton gave us in T1 & T2 just wasn't there. Arnie was his usual box-office self, effortlessly nailing down the iconic character he was clearly born to play.What doesn't work are some of the plot holes, and rather worryingly, some of the casting. Emily Clarke didn't quite encapsulate the Sarah Conner character for me. I can't help that feel that her character really been raised by a Terminator (how social services allowed that to happen, I do not know), she wouldn't look like she'd be better suited to Beverley Hills 90210. She didn't completely suck, but fell considerably short in terms of a female action hero in a sci-fi flick. In this category, the likes of Linda Hamilton (T2), Sigorney Weaver (Alien franchise) and more recently Emily Blunt (Edge of Tomorrow) all run rings around Clarke's performance. Another performance that feel short, was Jai Courtney, and he fell catastrophically short of Michael Biehn's masterful performance in the original. He just didn't look the part at all, being clean cut, and appearing to be well fed, quite unlike the original incarnation of this pivotal character. And the chemistry between him and Clarke just wasn't there, and his gradual warming up to Arnie was just silly. I haven't decided how I feel about what they've done with the John Conner character, and kind of feel that maybe Arnie should have killed Sarah Conner in the first one, saving everyone a whole bunch of trouble if her send was ultimately going to end up as the bad guy.Predictably, this film has left an opening for at least one sequel, which they will need to make quickly before Arnie gets too old. With Sarah Conner and co now living in 2017, with John not even conceived, maybe she'll decide that Reece really isn't all that, and either dump him (or get Arnie to give him the ol' hasta la vista treatment), preventing John from ever being born and ultimately saving a lot of folks a whole bunch of trouble. Perhaps Arnie could build another time machine, and go back in history and recruit a few folks who might be able to help out the resistance in their struggle against Skynet. Start of by visiting 1988 in order to bring in the seemingly unkillable John McClain, then 1982 in order to bring in the equally unkillable John Rambo, drop into 1938 for Indianna Johns, and heck, go further back to 50BC for Russell Crowe's gladiator. Bring in Chuck Norris from any time. Maybe Arnie could drop by 2010 and prevent the Expendables from being made, saving the world from that monstrosity of a franchise.Overall, I'm giving this movie a 6. I don't understand all the 10's I've seen for this, since it doesn't come close to the first two, and indeed the two that came after those. It is entertaining, providing you don't hang off every word in the dialogue, and you can suffer some mediocre performances, and some plot holes. It was great to have Arnie back, hopefully his upgrade lasts long enough for this re-jigged franchise to return to it's dark, gritty roots that made the original such a great film.",Terminator Genisys

Any rating of 1, or 10 can safely be disregarded for this film. As pure action it is very good, as a terminator film, it's passable, and as a film in general it is perfectly cromulent.

563,ihyousf,"Interesting, confusing, disappointing",6,18 July 2015,"Let me start of by saying I am a huge Terminator 2 fan. I believe it's the best movie ever made and I must have seen it at least 50 times. Naturally, whenever a new Terminator movie comes along, it catches my interest. Unfortunately, T3 and T4 were non worthy entries in the franchise, so my expectations for T5 Genisys were quite low. Also, because it wouldn't be a James Cameron movie.Nevertheless, I still watched T5 and was at parts pleasantly surprised! I really liked the part in 1984 with all the recognizable moments and scenes from T1. I also liked the start in 2029 which was a worthy alternative for the 2029 introscène of T2.But then, things start go very strange. The future scenes in 2017 make so little sense... I started to ask myself so many questions during this part, I didn't really enjoy the rest of the movie anymore.Who sent the T-800 back to 1973 to protect Sarah Connor? - If Kyle and Sarah don't mate in 1984, how can John ever be born in time? in the end, it all plays out by changing the future, but they couldn't have known that when they left 1984. - A T-800 can be upgraded to a T-1000? - Why didn't John kill Kyle and Sarah immediately in the police station? - What was J.K. Simmons doing in this movie? His role was completely useless. - how could have Arnold survived the helicopter crash with barely a scratch on him? God, curse this movie, but in T3, a helicopter crash almost completely destroyed Arnold. - Why was the helicopter chase scene not up to par with the T-1000 helicopter chase scene from T2 in teams of visual quality? This looked all so fake and like CGI crap. - Why did the T-1000 fall to the ground from a single gunshot wound to the head? - How could they have stopped a T-800 by shooting it with one snipper rifle bullet in the chest? - Why did I feel I had already seen almost the entire movie by watching the trailer?In the end, it's a mixed bag for me. I liked the nostalgia and future insights, but for the rest, this movie is pretty forgettable because of all the plot holes, the questions and the lesser quality compared to T1 and T2.",Terminator Genisys
564,j-lindsay-sens,It was....good i guess,5,18 August 2015,"OK so this movie is nowhere near the same level as the first two Terminator movies. With that being said, its not as bad as number three or Salvation. So Pros and Cons: Cons: There were many continuity errors, and many many plot holes. There was a lack of action and it sometimes got boring. The acting could have been better, there was a couple of cringe worthy moments for me, mainly from Emilia Clarke as Sarah Conner. The plot twist was revealed in the trailer, and would have been better if it was kept mysteryPros: Arnold is back and saved the show for me, he was missed in Salvation and he had many good parts. There was added comedy, while sometimes bad, often it was pretty funny. ""Old, not obsolete."" The action was good, nothing special, but it was passable and some shots were pretty good. They made up rules with time travel, and although this movie had its moments, it wasn't amazing my any means. However, they had a major plot point that was kept secret, who send Arnold back, which leads to the belief that they will make more. And as sequels are usually never as good as the original, then this means the next movie will be in the 5-6 star range. However, as T2 was better than T1, it gives me slight hope that the next will be better...If they follow time travel rules consistently for one movie, bring Arnold back, and add more action, then the next one will be a great movie.So overall, id give it a 6.5-7/10",Terminator Genisys
565,harpenfluit,"Old, but not obsolete",7,22 July 2015,"The story starts a bit confusing, but after a short time it's back to business. It's a great addition to the series and it's nice to see Arnold back in this role. The special effects are not always the best, but most parts look great. The new type terminator is great, but the old T800 is still not obsolete. The story is convincing enough and can be the prelude of new additions to this series. I hope Arnold will be part of these. It's a pity 3D is still the norm in most cinemas. This movie is best viewed in normal 2D. It's dark en there are no special benefits in 3D. The movie gives also a good critical note about our dependency of our smart-phones, tablets and the Internet integration. Genisys might be more true that we realize ;)",Terminator Genisys
566,filmguru11,Arnold is back as the Terminator,7,23 July 2015,"The fifth film in the Terminator franchise isn't nearly as good as the original or Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Thankfully, it's a slightly better offering than the third and fourth Terminator films (Rise of the Machines and Salvation).In the year 2029, John Connor (Jason Clarke) and the resistance finally manage to defeat Skynet. However, they were a little late because a Terminator was quickly sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor and prevent the resistance from ever succeeding. John is forced to send Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back in time to protect Sarah from the murderous Terminator.The movie goes downhill from here as the plot begins to get real complicated and convoluted. There are alternate timelines and paradox science thrown in, that had me scratching my head. Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) is like a lost puppy and does not live up to the fierce and iconic Sarah played by Linda Hamilton in the first two films. Jai Courtney is overall just bland and soulless in his role as Kyle Reese, even when the momentum of the movie is in top gear.The stand out would be Arnold who plays the aging T-800 to perfection. With his goofy pretend smiles, and wise-cracking one liners, he is a delight to watch. Even when he's going into combat with three different updated Terminators and getting knocked down, you tend to sympathize for him and go all the way.The chemistry between Arnold playing a father figure to Emilia's Sarah is lovable throughout the movie. The action sequences are quite exhilarating and the special effects are fantastic. Even with a complicated plot, the action in Terminator Genisys will keep you at the edge of your seat. Stay back for a small scene after the mid- credits, possibly leading to a sequel.",Terminator Genisys
567,fearthebeast360,pleasantly surprised,7,12 July 2015,"I was skeptical about going to see this film, the critic reviews didn't make for very good reading and lets be honest... when the fifth film of a franchise comes out it's never going to be amazing. However, despite the critic reviews this film was rather good. The effects were brilliant, the cinematography was good, the storyline was OK but to my disappointment it didn't go along well with the other terminator films plots. The acting by Jai Courtney was bad but the rest performed well especially Schwarzenegger and J.K. Simmons. I thought the genisys subplot was unnecessary and that John Connor shouldn't have been portrayed as a villain as it totally contradicts the other films portrayal of him. Overall this film was enjoyable but you must have seen the other four terminator films to be able to judge and enjoy this film properly.",Terminator Genisys
568,Shenoa77,Awful. Just plain awful.,1,22 November 2015,"Where do I begin? This movie was a travesty to the entire Terminator franchise. John Connor as a Terminator. Give me a break. I wanted to like this movie, came into it with an open mind, but this is ridiculous. I couldn't have predicted how awful it truly is. There are no adequate words. Swarzeneggar is back except this time he's called ""Pops"" - now if this wasn't a warning bell it pretty much explains why the rest of the movie was so terrible. Not only is this film awful on its own but it takes T1 and T2 and drags it through the dirt. This movie left me horrendously traumatized, a soul-crushing excuse for a movie. Not recommended, I repeat, this film is not recommended for viewing as to do so is not only dangerously infuriating but can also put viewers at risk of potentially giving into the urge to gouge one's own eyes out.",Terminator Genisys
569,krahl-81949,MicroReels Review,6,16 November 2015,"The Terminator series is one that was plagued with tons of critique and bashed for iterations that didn't provide the same level of excitement, plot or emotions that the first two movies did. Considering that 2015 was the year where few directors ""fixed"" their films' histories for the sake of future sequels, Terminator Genisys is also an equally commendable attempt at trying to set things right.Genisys literally goes back to the very beginning, with an adult John Connor attempting to send Kyle Reese back in time to warn his mother, Sarah Conner and stop Judgement Day from ever occurring at all. Mind boggled yet? Yes, time travel movies tend to do that to your head.

570,info-65411-11763,Too much !,5,21 November 2020,"Yes too much of everything, too much use of old line and old footage that worked. They wanted to make this movie feel like a real classic terminator movie but just hit wrong. Action was ok, Arnie was good as always, emila Clark as Sarah was just bad, the anything that surprised me was Jason Clark as John Conner really good actor but the role he was put into as being a terminator himself was just too much I rather saw him as the hero. And wtf happend to the guy playing the t1000 they just brought that into the movie as a nostalgic feeling but he could definitely be the end bad guy. Why why why just take it over the top and change every good actor in this movie to an unbelievable ending. I wanted this to be good but they just took too much extra to make it a good movie way over the top. Just 5 stars for Arnie showing up and good actors that deserved a better writing.",Terminator Genisys
571,battlereddy,Worst...Terminator...Ever...,3,26 December 2015,"I'm a Terminator fan, so let me give you my opinions of the series so far, so you'll know what I was hoping for in Genesys (there *are* some spoilers): The Terminator - Very Good. Original interesting story. Well cast, written, directed, produced and edited. Arnold perfect as the Terminator with a good infusion of humor.Terminator 2: Judgement Day - Excellent. All the good aspects of The Terminator along with tremendous special effects, a new terminator, the interesting twist of Arnold as a 'good' terminator and more 'self-aware' humor.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines: Good. Reading through the user reviews I was a little surprised that more people didn't like it. T3 perhaps elevated humor higher in the mix of sci-fi and action than in any of the movies. IMHO, when Kristanna Loken as the T-X licks the discarded bandage and does an instantaneous DNA analysis and match to John Connor - then gets this subtle smile of realization and anticipation - that's brilliant comedy.Terminator Salvation - Horrible. This movie removed any and all humor whatsoever. It wasn't fun and it wasn't that interesting.Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (TV Series) - Very Good. I had no idea what to expect, but although it took a little getting used to a new Sarah Connor and John Connor - it was well cast, written, directed, produced and edited. Summer Glau and Shirley Manson add excellent humor.Terminator Genesys - This movie was a long time in the making, with numerous re-writes and recasting over several years, so when I first heard it was going to be released, I had high hopes. Then I saw the casting - and other than Emilia Clarke and Arnold of course, I suddenly had a lot of doubts about it. More doubts ensued when about 75% of the the trailer I saw for Genesys in the theater was James Cameron talking about how great he thought the movie was and that it fit his vision of what the 3rd movie should've been. Genesys had a reasonable opening weekend, but the true test of a movie is its longevity after word of mouth spreads. It did poorly the 2nd weekend, and I knew it had to be bad. Yet with all my reservations about it, I figured that with such low expectations going in, that it couldn't disappoint me. I was wrong. It's horrible. It was as if the worst deleted scenes from a previously unreleased Terminator movie were blindly and randomly edited together. I'm not one to gripe about whether the time travel theories are scientifically feasible - it's science fiction - but I don't like a movie itself to be disjunctive and lack continuity. The jokes that tried to emulate Arnold's catch-phrases from earlier movies fell short and weren't funny. The CG 'young' Arnold were impressive, but definitely not enough to make the movie worth watching.",Terminator Genisys
572,syllopsium,Sub par with huge plot holes,4,5 July 2015,"On the bright side, Arnie wasn't at all bad, and the first sections of the film in the future and 1984 are OK albeit an inferior copy of sequences from the prior films.It's at that point it all comes apart. The rationale of the characters and their planning makes no sense. Worse, the plot holes are so gaping as to exceed a healthy suspension of disbelief. The stunts are ridiculously over the top and contradict the way vehicles and helicopters move, even in most films.The casting is sub par - they simply cannot match up to the actors in the first two films. Direction is lacking, too - there is virtually no suspense.On the bright side it's better than Salvation, but that's not saying much. Go and re-watch Mad Max again, instead - that shows how to revive a franchise.",Terminator Genisys
573,dan-willi84,Great film. The best Terminator film since Terminator 2: Judgement Day.,10,5 July 2015,"Terminator: Genisys is great! It is a great film and in my opinion, I think it is the best Terminator film since Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Arnold Schwarzenegger was once again great in the role of The Terminator. Emilia Clarke was brilliantly cast as Sarah Connor and she did a really good job and she is really pulled it off and Jai Courtney gave an average performance and he looks nothing like Michael Behin. The film had good writing, good laughs. A couple of nods and references to the earlier films. Emilia Clarke has potential to be Lara Croft in the reboot of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. The film was a good comeback for Schwarzenegger. I think Terminator: Genisys was way better than Terminator: Salvation, which as far as I am concerned is the worst Terminator film. If you are a fan of the Terminator franchise, I highly recommend this film.",Terminator Genisys
574,DJOfRadioGallifrey,Something new and something old works. Win!,9,6 July 2015,"You have to except that any story put in the public domain, is fair game, it can be manipulated or bent to the will of the director, or story teller, it never undermines the creator but flatters them. And it doesn't render the other films obsolete,they're still there. The story can be told many times, or it can be changed. It's the love and intrigue for the characters that helps us tolerate these paradoxes. I'm a fan of the 1st cause it scares the crap out of me, the second is my favourite- far fetched- but I love it, liquid man, a kid in mortal danger, new improved sarah 'Hamilton' connor- ace. My next new favourite; Genisys. Time travel is a trope- it feeds fanfictioners. I love how they explore the paradox that is the terminator timeline. The writers are giving us a complicated puzzle of a storyline to solve, then they give you a logical explanation that does make sense. You get a bit of fanservice- teases from previous films, faithful reshoots, one liners- and hints they are about to make a reference then suddenly do something new to keep you on your toes. For example, instead of a T-1000 collecting a cast off with his shoe, he leans out of a moving vehicle and picks it up rather simply with his hand. Another event explored, is the miracle of magnetism fields- and how they crop up in all sorts of places. The cast are fresh new talent mixed with an iconic actor/ character. This pleases me, because not only is the interaction different, the story has changed which mean the relationships are definitely going to be interesting. Seeing two people who are meant to fall in love, and watch them get pissy about it. Or revealing terminators can learn how to feel over time. You also get the scenes people have be crying out to see, the actually time machine and prep before time travel. I was giddy that it had been shown and can be filed in the franchise.You gonna see more than one travel sequence. And you get a better cityscape in a nuclear war- with crisp effects and a towering atmosphere- reminiscent of the matrix 'real world' you don't want a dry desert apocalypse- 'salvation or fury road has given us, you want wet concrete and bloodied metal with retro military gear, and night time battles. And a revelation that Kyle Reese was born after the war meaning he would have no idea what a restaurant or waitress is, let alone dating. The action is occasionally original, but likes to give classic ' I'm hiding but it didn't work' and I'm stuck inside something thats about to plummet- grab my hand' But it's all so fluid you have no doubt that it would indeed happen if you ending up feeling from a cyborg and members of homeland security. Because ignorant people are a threat too.With have a new John Connor- who is actually like a new character but with a familiar name. I have no problem with this, that is a meaty role that has been fleshed out, but it is very out of character. Sure that second trailer gave away the big spoiler, which was annoying, but if they dropped it on you in viewing the actual film, would you have dropped your popcorn and gone '*beep* no, they can't do this.' Maybe. A chance was took, now you take the chance and see this surprisingly stunning movie, the effects have been improved since the release of the 1st trailer. The CGI in genisys has put salvation to shame.No flat looking young arnie gurning at the screen, but a realistic rendering. I went in with moderate expectations and walked out on a high. Stick around for the mid credit scene.",Terminator Genisys
575,outerheaven23,So embarrassing I almost cried...,3,7 November 2015,"I was there when T2 came out. That film shaped my youth and practically defined the perfect movie for me. Flash forward 24 years and now I have to write this review about the ultimate slap in the face: Terminator Genisys. A film so ridiculously awkward, miswritten, miscast, mispaced and misdirected I would have gladly preferred an aneurysm over having to watch it. One idiotic one-liner after another, rehashing entire dialogues from the past, a crappy digital look, so many visual effects their quality is absolutely sub-standard, a moronic and completely forgettable soundtrack and, most of all, no dread or ambiance which is the entire point of a Terminator movie. I had always thought the franchise had hit its low point with T3 but quite frankly this piece of sh*t easily takes the cake. If I were to list everything I hated in detail this would be a truly endless review so I won't and really can't even bother, but I seriously almost cried because I am so hurt how much punishment something I really care about has to endure...",Terminator Genisys
576,riordantheking,Is there anything good about this film?,1,6 May 2016,"This film is complete garbage, even worse than Terminator 3, if that's even possible. I have heard many ""fans"" of the series saying that this is a ""return to form"" or that ""Arnie's still got it"" and well, no, that's not true at all.Firstly, what works in this film? Well, I sort of appreciate that they got Arnold back, even though he really is quite terrible and is way to old, so, that isn't very good. I like Jason Clarke as John Connor, even though he doesn't look or act the part. Wait, that's not a good thing...What doesn't work? Firstly, the ""acting"" The acting is garbage, Emilia Clarke does nothing but bitch, Arnold screws up all of his lines, and Jai Courtney is the worst thing to ever grace the screen. Also, the music. What music? I don't remember a single track. The action is extremely boring to watch, directed without any flair or excitement, and the story is haphazardly written, it really makes no sense at all. There are a ton more things that are terrible, but we would be here all day if I had to list them all.The only interesting thing about this film is how it got a theatrical release, even the production values are garbage. They obviously spent so much time and money of CG young Arnie, that they just rushed everything else.Do not torture yourself by watching this movie. It makes Salvation look like a masterpiece.",Terminator Genisys
577,mj68538,"Far better than expected, but one huuuuuge plot hole",7,13 November 2017,"After the savage reviews of this and some of it's predecessors I didn't bother to see it at the cinema or even on DVD, I waited for it to appear on the TV.I was expecting very little from this film indeed, so maybe that's why I liked it; after all, if you're expecting a poo sandwich, a processed cheese sandwich seems quite nice in comparison.Yes, it's full of references to gags, special effects and whole scenes ripped from previous films, but if a movie franchise based on time paradoxes isn't self-referential there's something very wrong indeed...Personally I liked the way it got back to the premise of the first two films and the Sarah Connor Chronicles - losing the time paradoxes from the last two films destroyed one of the primary interesting things about the Terminator franchise - the whole 'what if?' scenario. And even without this, the effects and action are a match for Salvation without the cringeworthy ""Look, I'm a real boy!"" moments, so is several points up from T4 for a start.However, despite my general liking for the movie (it felt much more a part of the Terminator series than the previous two), it did have one plot hole so big you could sail the Titanic through it - bearing in mind Skynet/T5000 won at the beginning of the film (and must have know it was going to win beforehand) why the hell did it send a Terminator back in time, thus jeopardizing it's own chances of success? It was on a win-win whatever happened - Connor dies in the past=no resistance, Connor lives=take him over, and have some fun with the remains of the resistance.",Terminator Genisys
578,CampoReviews,Better Than I Expected,6,11 July 2015,"So... Terminator Genisys ...yup thats a thing. This movie was no where near as bad as some people/critics had me believing, I mean it wasn't all that great either but it was definitely a decent action movie. im almost glad i went into this with no expectations because i didn't feel so bad that it wasn't the sequel we all wanted, it was just more like a hurry up and put out a movie before the deadline or we lose the rights BS (ex. Amazing Spider-man, Fantastic Four, the new Ninja Turtles). Was It a bad movie? no Was it a bad movie in the Terminator franchise? Ya, to me this is probably the worst installment though it is definitely still very watchable i probably wouldn't pay to see it and i didn't but.. ya. The acting in this movie could have been better i mean Arnold was freaking awesome, Emilia Clarke was OK but i felt like she had trouble speaking fast and covering her accent and didn't fit to well in a action roll. Jason Clarke's Australian accent breaks through multiple times if you pay attention and i honestly thought he was the worst part of the whole movie especially the fact that everyone somewhat resembles the former actor except the most important one in John Conner. Jai Courtney played Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese Playing Jai Courtney if that makes sense he only has one character and he always plays that, though he did not destroy this franchise in the same way he did with Die Hard, and yet i loathe the fact that i will see him again in my beloved Suicide Squad movie. J.K. Simmons thank you, you once again were amazing and possibly the saving grace as far as acting can go in this movie even in such a small roll. The best parts of this movie for me was *maybe spoilers* when they go back to 1984 i thought that was so cool i wish they kept going through all the past events it would have been nice i loved all the easter eggs. also the Arnold vs. Arnold was cool for all 20 seconds but the best scene by far is the 7 seconds long of the song Bad Boys from Cops playing and the 3 Main Characters getting their mugshots taken doesn't say much for the film as a whole. The Biggest 3 issues i had with this movie were the total and utter disregard for the Third film Terminator : Rise of the Machines and its entire plot line in the time line, as well as the the whole John Conner's age thing from T2 until now. But the worst part was the way the whole bottom of this film just dropped out with about 10 mins run time remaining it was like the writers just gave up on the ending and winged it during production. Everyone kept telling me how intricate and confusing the plot was i honestly didn't have a hard time understanding what was going on, at times i felt like a lot of what they talked about didn't have anything to do with what was happening and made it confusing for no reason especially if you already didn't understand what was going on i can see why people got lost. Also a lot of the plot doesn't even make sense in terms of what and why they are doing things they are doing but i get the whole time line scenario. Overall i mean the acting was decent enough minus John Conner, The script was pretty terrible, the CG was good but i expected more, Good action scenes and set pieces, an almost decent story line, decent directing, good production value and a good soundtrack/score i felt like this movie had potential to be more but was just very rushed 3/5 Stars because its 100% watchable at least once especially if you are a fan of the franchise, if you were not turned off by the last 2 you will probably really like this movie its a turn off your brain i have nothing to do after work today kind of movie.",Terminator Genisys

580,thewoodmeister,Hit the post with this reboot attempt,6,3 November 2019,"I was expectant with Genisys, but it soon became clear from the trailers (which spoilt most of the plot twists) that this wasn't going to be the reboot I'd hoped for.I really liked what they tried to do by going back to the first Terminator and changing the timeline, the idea and the cgi were for the most part well executed. Then enter Jai Courtney. I could just about get my head around a new Sarah Connor, and Emilia Clarke does a passable job, but Jai Courtney as Reese? That, plus the complete lack of any chemistry between the two of them and the heart of this film is seriously impaired.That alone might not have been ""terminal"" for this film but then they went and turned John Connor into the new Terminator. Ok, on paper I get it, what a twist, but then you give that twist away in the trailers???The saving grace for this film was Arnold doing Arnold and the way they weaved in his actual ageing frame was clever. He just needed a better supporting cast to really reboot this series.All in all an ok ride, the opening scenes and the bit where they trap the new T-1000 were cool and set a pace and tone that I thought would continue, sadly we get a little lost in all the time travel and John Connor as a Terminator robot Skynet machine man nonsense.",Terminator Genisys
581,graphixv,A Plastic Toy,3,29 July 2015,"I'm not sure why any fan of Terminator 1 and 2 would like this film. If James Cameron likes this film, I worry about his sanity.I can accept the overly convoluted storyline and various plot holes.But the problem here is the characters have no depth, which may be a result of miscasting, bad acting, bad dialogue or a combination of the two. As a result, I really didn't care what happened to them. Quite frankly, Kyle came off as kind of a jerk. Once you take worrying about the characters out of the equation, this film had no suspense.While some of the effects were good (1984 Arnold) some others just looked really bad. Some of the worst CGI in this film (which is just riddled with it) was the helicopter chase. It looked and felt like a video game. If James Cameron could do a chase using real helicopters doing real stunts in Terminator 2, why couldn't they do it here?The Audience isn't being fooled, this stuff looks really fake. If it looks fake, the audience no longer cares. Even some of the T-800 stuff looked like CGI.Not to hit everything wrong with this film (because it would take five pages) but the 1984 stuff didn't work too well either. In the attempt to recreate the 1984 film almost shot for shot, all the film did was point out it's own inadequacies to people who have seen the original multiple times.At least Terminator Salvation introduced some cool new Terminators like the T-600.This movie just didn't have any of that. There is no tension in the film because we've seen almost all of it before (and done better).Terminator 1 was not a feel good movie, it was bleak, serious and gritty. Terminator 2 was a much larger film that had a few comedy elements in it but was mostly serious and introduced some new ideas. However, this film is constantly trying to be funny. Why not just make the next one a total comedy?I would not watch this film again. It's like a cheap $1 knockoff plastic toy in a dollar store. It's tied with Terminator 3 for worst film in the franchise.",Terminator Genisys
582,DeniseNY,Keep Your Expectations Low . . .,5,8 July 2015,". . . and You Won't Be Disappointed.That's the best advice I can give if you see Terminator Genisys (""TG""). The latest in this aging franchise. Just go to the theater expecting to see loads of action and visual effects, without a trace of a sensible plot and you'll be completely satisfied. If, however, you want more, like a story you can actually follow, you'll be sorely disappointed. TG is a boatload of action overkill with several rehashed one-liners to make it feel familiar. Add to that, zero character development and more plot holes than a 10 pound block of Swiss cheese. In fact, the plot is so confusing, I am still asking myself ""what the hell did I just watch?"". If your IQ is over 50, you're gonna be asking yourself the same thing.OK, well TG is not THAT bad. But it's not that good either. But here's my synopsis for those that dare read it. The following will contain some spoilers, so stop right here if you don't want to read them.The story seems to pick up where the original film started - I think. Frankly, I'm not sure. It's hard to tell whether this is really a sequel or if they are pulling a Star Trek style reboot trick by changing the past so they can sell us new versions of the same old stories. TG starts out good with a look at post- apocalyptic 2029 on the day that John Connor (Jason Clarke) and his army will defeat Skynet once and for all. And just like in the original film, the machines manage to send a Terminator (young Arnold Schwarzeneggar in digital clips from the original film) back to 1984 at the last second on a mission to kill Sarah Connor (a woefully miscast, Emilia Clarke). Conner seems to take almost too long to select Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) to take that fateful trip back to 1984 and save Mom, but off he finally goes. At this point, the film goes off the rails and turns in to a time traveling, clustereff filled with confusing paradoxes, as well as characters and technology that appear out of nowhere without any explanation as to how they got there. This is especially true with the aging Terminator, ""Pops"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger). In fact, his entire existence is written off as ""we don't know who sent him here"". Seriously! Then there is that time machine they used in 1984 to send Sarah and Kyle Back To The Future to save the day and make that Robert Zemeckis connection you didn't even know existed until I pointed it out! How did THAT get there? We don't know! It just is. And then there is the T1000 who shows up in the middle of it all. Where did he come from? I thought he wasn't due until Terminator 2? Wait! IS this T2? What did I miss? I'm confused!And that's just the first half of this 2+ hour movie! I'm not kidding. The second half takes place in 2017 (Remember, Back to the Future?) where Skynet is now an app and is about to take over a digital device near you. There's a major plot-twist in here that I won't mention, but it does make the film more watchable.In the end, you'll be left with more questions than answers as you try to comprehend this mess of a flick. There is, however, one bright spot in TG that will help carry you through this disaster and that's Arnold Schwarzeneggar, himself. He plays the aging T-800, ""Pops"" and is actually fun to watch - in a bittersweet kind of way. Although, it's hard to see the actor who was once the ferocious Terminator reduced to being the comic relief. Don't get me wrong, he gets plenty of action in TG, but it's not the same. If you see Terminator Genisys, you'll see what I mean. I give it 5 stars for the action and visual effects. That much is watchable.",Terminator Genisys
583,Starbuck823,Nothing beats the originals but this is part of the group,8,2 July 2015,"OK, so is this better than T1 or 2? No but it is worthy of being a third. The whimpy John Conner of T3 sucked and Salvation, well it might have worked better if it was a stand alone story of the Terminator 'universe'. So this movie disregards those and picks up from the original judgment day date and it's much better for it.Be aware, the first 20 minutes or so are nearly the same as T1 - the future events are new and look much closer to the original bleak vision of a machine ruled world. Once Reese heads back, events are near the same as T1 and wow, was there some attention to detail! As a fan of the originals, I appreciate the effort made to replicate the sets, costumes and actors. Now don't worry, it doesn't go on for long and this is where the story starts to change.The story adds a bit more mind bending to the time travel concept. I suspect they had to do this because the originals really didn't explain much other than the fact time travel had occurred, so they needed more explanation to create different events. Some complain it's far fetched or complicated - I didn't think so personally, but we are dealing with time travel, what do we expect really? The plot basics are essentially the same - stop Skynet. But I liked how they shifted Sarah's character and how Reese had to adapt to a new mission - it added new elements to characters that have been around for a long time.The actors do a good job with their script. I wasn't sold on Jai Courtney being Reese but he did better than I expected. He had to deal with the fact the Sarah Connor that he fell in love with wasn't the person he expected and he was manipulated into his feelings for her by John Connor who he hero-worships. This gives a new spin on the Reese character which I liked. And then we have 'Pops'. I did have a laugh at this though I'm thinking most won't. Lets face it, we have an aging Arnie and we can't turn back the clock to the 90s when we was in awesome Terminator prime. So I thought by making him age in the film and look older was a better option than trying to make him look and play young. His lines are a bit rehashed but it's good to have him in the film. His relationship with Sarah does somewhat echo John's attachment in T2.The standouts are Jason Clarke and Emilia Clarke. Jason does a great job as John Connor and is very much what I would envision him to be. He does what he has to and is not beyond manipulating people because he knows what will happen if he does not. But it's Emilia Clarke who is the lead and she does a wonderful job. The new Sarah Connor is battle hardened from a young girl now but carries much frustration at that the one path she destined for. I suppose I'd feel the same if my family had been killed, a cyborg from the future saved me, told me that my child is the savior of man kind and you must fall in love with Kyle Reese to have this child or things will never exist. Yep, I'd be a bit frustrated too! She does a lot of butt kicking and does a great job of being tough but there are some quieter moments that are carried with a lot of feeling and I credit Emilia Clarke for making it work so well.They evolved Skynet and how it would be implemented is very plausible in todays type of world. In the 80s and 90s, the concept of computer intelligence takeover seemed possible via military applications but now it goes to proper scary possible in todays online world.People, ignore critics reviews. This actually can be compared to JW somewhat as they are sequels/reboot combos that are out at the moment. This has a Metascore of 39 and Jurassic World had 70. I enjoyed and rated Genysis much more than JW and I feel that those scores are very wrong. 50-55 would be more accurate of Genysis and 40-45 for JW. Genysis was better because it respected the originals while creating it's own story where JW nodded so much to the original it became the same story with bigger teeth and dumber characters.Overall, this movie did a good job of linking to the classics while creating it's own niche for future story lines. It was very enjoyable and made so by the strong leads of Emilia Clarke and Jason Clarke.",Terminator Genisys
584,kalavic,Before we get into what makes this movie boring...,3,22 December 2020,"First, it's important to explain some reasons why I'm leaving this review of an action film about time travel. There are lots of reasons, and some of them almost make sense when you think about it. Now, that we're beginning, forget that, we'll start doing something else entirely.
Now I'm going to explain why I'm going to write a new review about a blockbuster involving time travel. There are several contributing factors, and if you consider them long enough, you will begin to comprehend. Now that we have begun, let's switch things up, we'll enact a new plan.
At this point, it's time for me to pen a review for a sequel to the 80s Schwarzenegger flick that is unique from the one I originally planned. There are details pertinent to understanding. You will mull things over until you connect the dots. We are in the execution phase, and now we are doing something else. Congratulations! You should understand the general feel of the film.",Terminator Genisys
585,bill-37-3753,Liked the movie but Emilia Clarke???????,6,8 September 2015,"I enjoyed the movie. Arnold was cool and indestructible as always. Linda Hamilton stole the show when she was Sarah Connor. The exact opposite can be said about Emilia Clarke. Which rock did they find this chubby Hobbit under. Really this was the best they could come up with for Sarah Connor. Maybe it was a budget thing. She couldn't run the 40 yard dash in 10 secs. Nothing appealing about her or her acting. Did someone owe someone a favor? Sarah Connor will always be Linda Hamilton , she could have done better now than Emilia Clarke..........10 lines. I was trying to keep it nice and short but you have to put 10 lines. I found Emilia so lacking in every way that I was compelled.......no , provoked to write this review.",Terminator Genisys
586,zshah2010,"Excellent, yet not perfect.",10,4 August 2015,"This review will have two parts. one will have me speaking as a biased Terminator fan, and the other will give my honest overall opinion.Biased review: OMIGOSH THAT WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVAH 10/10!! DIDJA SEE THE T-1000?? AND THEN HE WAS DEFEATED BY ACID, BUT THEN ARNOLD IS OLD AND KILLS THE ORIGINAL TERMINATOR AND THE REMAKE OF THE SCENE WAS AMAZING! HE WAS SO FUNNY THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE, IT IS SO REFRESHING TO HAVE HIM BACK!! oh. AND DO U REMEMBER WHEN JOHN CONNOR BECAME A TERMINATOR?? HES A FREAKING ANDROID!! and...THE DOCTOR IS SKYNET!!!! THEN ARNIE GOT THE T-1000 POWERS, IM SO HAPPY!!!AHEM!...uh, yeah, heres my unbiased review. while i loved the movie and it was a load of fun, if it came out before terminator 3, i would've been happier. it isn't perfect to most people, but like I said...I'm a Doctor who fan. Time travel is confusing, and that should be understood. after all., this movie reminded me a lot of Back to the future part 2, with the altered time-line with an altered future. i felt it made sense to me, but i will admit that some scenes could have been written better, because even the scenes that I understood took me awhile to get, like in Inception (which, FYI i also loved). all the visual effects are good, but ill admit they aren't perfect. i would've liked it better if they used the same style as terminator 2, but that may be asking for too much. This is by no means a masterpiece, and it is leagues behind the first 2, it succeeds in being what it is...a terminator sequel. it doesn't insult the audience the way 3 and 4 did, and I personally feel it can make my top 20. i could definitely see myself re-watching this, even if the twist is known.Yeah, about that twist..i have to say, I'm glad i avoided spoilers...that caught me off guard. its such genius...the machines found a way to turn they're biggest enemy to their side, and he actually is a terrifying villain. the design, ill say, could use some work, but overall, a great new addition to the terminator mythos. and of course, the end credits scene...yes. i look forward to more sequels especially if they have Matt smith in them! if they manage to top this or even just stay at this level, I'm totally hyped for the future installments. definitely worth watching, but please, if you're a terminator fan, watch this in 3d! you wont regret it!",Terminator Genisys

My god I want to explain why but I've never wanted to write a review containing spoilers and I'm not going to start now.The fact that the acting is amateur at best, the special effects are average and the script is also average isn't the point. As a true Terminator fan I can oversee that as long as the plot makes sense, which it of course doesn't.If you're a massive T1 and T2 fan.....DON'T WATCH IT.

588,mayank-s-dwivedi,A downer in the Terminator Series,5,5 July 2015,"Well so I went in with not much expectations, and found the movie below my no-expectations' level, in other words bad. Terminator 1 and 2 brought in a new concept, was very well executed and the story seemed real for the 2 odd hours it ran. But not with this one. Even with the pressure to deliver something different in the terminator franchise, this movie overall did pretty bad.Acting: Was OK, good actors do decent acting, even if the plot is poor Plot: Had a twist, but nothing we cannot predict and a lot boring Story: As bad as it gets Action Scenes: All the old tricks executed in a poorer mannerI couldn't relate with the characters, it kinda felt the dialogs were forced out of their mouths, pieces of the story were poorly stitched together. 3D and CGI effects were OK, but why wouldn't they be, it is a norm now.Overall I wouldn't say worth the bucks to buy a movie ticket for this one. Maybe watch it over laptop by fast forwarding.Would I want to see a terminator sequel, yeah .. but with probably better direction, plot and an original thrill.",Terminator Genisys
589,Fanboy218,"Not a great movie, but Terminator fans will like this one",7,28 June 2015,"It is a VERY flawed movie, any one who have seen it knows that. Though the prospect of the plot is interesting and exciting, the writing was really baad, and the directing was just as bad. The casting of Kyle Reese was horrible, Jai Courtney proves to still be the most overrated actor living today. Putting all of that aside, I really enjoyed this movie. May it's because I'm a huge Terminator&T2 fan growing up, and the idea to be honest is very exciting and to be honest I'm not really disappointed. This may not be a good movie, but hey at least it's not boring like Salvation, the storyline kept me glued to the screen. Arnold was the best part of the movie, he did great in everything he does. Emilia Clarke also did the best anyone could do, she has the 'it' factor of a female action star, which is quite hard to find. The first half of the movie was quite great, but then it got real messy the second half. I blame Alan Taylor for that, the property's too big for him, he's not capable yet of doing a franchise this huge. If you're not familiar with the characters/storyline, I understand fully if you hate this film cause it was very messy and the writing is very confusing.my personal score: 7.6/10 my objective score: 5.5/10",Terminator Genisys
590,stansellb,Let's just ignore one of the best movies of all time.,3,1 November 2015,"The movie has some excellent ideas (a particle-based terminator, traveling back to the beginning), they are so poorly executed it's almost insulting to fans of the franchise. Terminator 1, 2, and 3 (which I actually liked because it made sense) seem to have never occurred.Terminator 1 implies that the first time Sarah Connor encountered a terminator (or Kyle Reese, for that matter) was when she was 20-30 years old, however now we're told she met one when she was 9 years old, and now she was essentially raised by one. Terminator 2 tells us that the man most responsible for Judgement Day was Miles Dyson, but he dies, erasing all data related to it. Only now we're told that it was his son who created Skynet, in collusion with Skynet itself. A paradox if ever there was one.Terminator 3 tells us that Skynet is inevitable. It's the natural evolution of machines. Which makes sense. However none of the events of 3 are referenced in Genisys and instead Skynet is apparently just the cloud, in essence retreading the events of 3. As I said, the particle-based terminator is cool, but not much else. This film can't decide if it wants to be a sequel or a reboot and in the end is just frustrating for all the moments you'll find yourself saying ""It would have been cool if they did this instead of that.""",Terminator Genisys
591,Everything_PopCulture,Heavily under-rated!!! A fantastic TRUE third film in the franchise. Ignore the critics and hate it's actually really good!!!!,9,3 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys has been hated ever since it was first announced. People seemed to hate the idea of another film since the bad T3 and Salvation. Then the trailer came out and divided the audience, then the second trailer came out and divided those who were still keen for it from the first trailer. Ultimately I was one of the few still keen for this film. AND IT DELIVERED!!!!!James Cameron advertised this film as being the true 3rd film of the franchise....and it most certainly is. An awesome true sequel to T2. All the critics are slamming this film. I believe it's because these days critics are less credible and actually make up their minds before seeing a movie and go in with a negative attitude and decide the film is bad before they've even seen it. Genisys was really good.It had solid action sequences that were very entertaining. The visuals were spectacular. Really reminiscent of the T1 and T2!!!! The acting surprised me quite a bit. I always liked the casting of Emilia Clarke, especially since she looks like a young Linda Hamilton. She actually nailed the role. Jai Courtney was good as Kyle Reese, he's no Michael Biehn but he did better than I originally thought. Arnie is front and centre in the action and he was awesome in this film, really proved he can still be an action star.People complain the plot is far to confusing.....it really isn't....what you need to understand is some questions were PURPOSELY left unanswered for the sequel. Other times people are confused simply because they aren't paying enough attention. The answers are there so make sure you listen!!!!Genisys was incredible. I'm happy to see it as part of the franchise and am super keen for the sequels. The box office better do well cause if that's the reason why the next 2 sequels aren't made.....I will RIOT!!!!Genisys delivers great visuals, acting, solid action and a very intriguing story that is just awesome!Don't listen to the negative reviews of critics and fans alike. Go and see the film and judge it for yourself. It may have a 25% rotten tomatotes critic score but it has a 70% rotten tomatoes audience score and 7.2 on IMDb....thus proving critics are arrogant sods and the audience knows what a good film is when it's put on the big screen!",Terminator Genisys
592,lbk99-geo,Much Better than expected,9,8 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys s the fifth movie in the Terminator (Tm) franchise, but in terms of continuity actually functions well as a sequence to the second Tm movie, T2. It has receive some bad press, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a fun movie to watch.The first 30 minutes or so of the movie is similar in many ways to the first two Tm movies, with many of the same characters. However, there are changes, the nature of and reason for them being slowly explained as the movie goes on. This movie added a lot of depth to many of the characters and in that sense was more similar to T2 than to the first Tm movie.The acting was not academy award winning level, but I do not think many people go to movies like this looking for the greatest acting in the world. However, all of the main cast do a nice job of making their characters interesting and generally believable, within the confines of the fictional universe they inhabit.Not surprisingly the movie has some great action sequences. The action was non-stop enough to make the character interaction moments sometimes too brief, but the movie still had a recognizable plot with some cool twists along the way.I saw this movie twice, once standard format and once in 3D. As is often the case in many recent movies the 3D was okay, but in my mind not worth the higher ticket price.My own take on the Tm movies is that the first was good, the second (T2) was a classic of the action/SF genre, but the third and forth movies were not up to the same level of T2. Terminator Genisys is a great follow on to T2, with homages to it, but telling an exciting story of its own. Not quite to the level of T2, but still a fun movie to watch!",Terminator Genisys

Fingers crossed for the next effort!",Terminator Genisys
594,not_even_one,On par with Salvation,2,10 July 2015,"This movie proves one thing: the Terminator franchise should really be laid to rest. Trying to rehash the same storyline and characters over and over again just doesn't give enough creative room to come up with a credible story. Genisys fails at reinventing Sarah, John, the T-800 and Kyle Reese, but it is also a very poor movie from a technical standpoint. Here's why.Nothing ever happens in this movie. The does not move forward with action or scenes but through exposition. A lot of exposition. They all fight, then they get to a room, then someone starts explaining what's happened or what they have to do. The dialogue is poor. Yeah, that's a bit of a deal breaker since the plot moves forward only through dialogue, but there you go. It is very awkward, very generic. It doesn't seem that the writers tried to flesh out the characters, give them personality, etc. Arnold's terminator acts out of character, for the whole movie. It just doesn't obey any of the established franchise rules from the previous titles. They've tried to make him way too kid and family friendly. There's no character arc, like in 2, no motivation, no explanation as to why he is the way he is. Kyle Reese is a useless character. Really, he doesn't bring anything to the table, is not pivotal to the plot anymore, and Sarah doesn't need him for protection since she has a T-800 on her side. All he does throughout the whole movie is bitch and whine. Plot holes and convenient plot devices. The movie's full of them both, to the point where a major plot device would just appear out of nowhere, without any explanation, not a single line. The film even undermines its own premise: it never explains why only one person can time travel, and surely enough, soon everyone's going back in time. Lots of CG. Almost every special fx scene was CG, and it showed.I seriously wonder which one was worse between this mess and Salvation.",Terminator Genisys

This is the worst rehash of old ideas ever resold to a desperate fanbase. A baby-faced Sarah Connor who looks like she should be getting ready for a prom date unlike the hardened paramilitary character that Lind Hamilton trained like a madwoman to deliver in looks and performance. Some 8-ball headed actor trying to pass of John Connor, an Asian Robert Patrick doing all the same stuff we saw 20 years ago and an old age pensioner Arnorld Schwarzenegger being made to do everything in CGI his awful frame lost the ability to do decades ago.

I can understand why Arnold would want to go back to a sure thing after his recent box office disappointments but honestly I'd have more faith in a new Conan or True Lies film than this. The action is fit for a mediocre Marvel film and really doesn't suit Terminator to be bouncing about like the Hulk. The drawn out plot which is clearly a trilogy idea that wouldn't fit one side of A4 feels like a pilot for a 90's TV show and the effects are poor. When Arnold loses his skin it's mostly CGI and he looks like Kano, no blood because you know the kids might get scared. I really hope this flops so Arnold might go to another franchise and give us something decent in his aging years. Truly disappointing.",Terminator Genisys

The 3D helped immerse us in the story, which it should do without distracting from it, and it did this quite well. The storyline was good and as others mentioned, Arnold's (the Terminator's) ability to relate with Sarah and other humans was often humorous and handled very well, adding to an already enjoyable movie. While I figured I would enjoy the movie to some degree, it exceeded my expectations and even my wife was surprised that she enjoyed it as much as she did. My advice is, see it! See it in 3D if you can... and STAY to watch the credits for an extra scene!.",Terminator Genisys
600,mjf_722,"Entertaining. Judge for yourself, don't listen to the so called ""experts"".",8,1 July 2015,"Firstly I am a longtime fan of the original and it's sequel. I don't take movies as seriously as some do on sites like this, so I also liked part 3 and Salvation - though they weren't on the same level as the first two. I was irritated when Cameron never came back for a 3rd, but accepted it and accepted that any new Terminator movie from that point on wouldn't be on par. I'm not like the Star Wars fans who think that each new movie past the original trilogy will have that same magic and then bashes anything that comes out. If you come to see this movie or any Terminator movie past the first two expecting it to match the originals, you'll be only disappointing yourself. With that said, I found part 3 and Salvation entertaining and fine entries to the franchise. This latest movie is also a fine entry to the Terminator universe.I wasn't a fan of yet another reboot, but instead of judging it before it's release, I decided to just accept it because they were doing it anyway.It was entertaining - like a movie is supposed to be. Of course it doesn't match to the original 2 movies and it was never going to. I went to see it with an open mind and not like a troll (like the many who inhabit this site) does.It was about what was expected for a Terminator movie, even a reboot. They did the ""alternate time-line"" storyline to appease the fans of the original like they have done with other franchises (like Star Trek). They had the car chase scene which is a staple of all the Terminator movies. They paid a pretty good homage to the original and hard fans of that movie will surely notice that. Overall action is about what you'd expect these days.Of course Schwarzenegger was cast to tie this set of movies to the last set. They explained the flesh aging just fine, even if they had this Terminator a little more ""human"" than it's predecessors. The cast was fine especially Emila Clarke, who was nicely cast as Sarah Connor and did a great job. The only major casting flaw was Jason Clarke (no relation) as John Connor - pretty weak casting altogether for that character. He didn't fit that role whatsoever. I would have rather had Michael Edwards (T2) back or even Edward Furlong over Jason Clarke. Jai Courtney generally bores me, but was fine here for this movie's version of that character. I would have cast a different actor for Kyle Reese, but it could have been worse. They left some questions unanswered, but I assume they'll answer those questions in the sequels. They really should have not had loose ends with this release since sequels are not guaranteed if the movie doesn't make as much as they hope.If you're a fan of the franchise and don't take movies so seriously to the point where you give yourself a headache, then I would recommend seeing it. If you want to get entertained like movies are supposed to do, then I would recommend it. If you're going to dissect every minute down and rant about how they ""got it wrong"" and all that babble - skip it. Just stay home and stop watching movies altogether. If you're one of those who'll say ""this is the worst movie of all time"" or ""this is garbage"" - well get out more and actually watch more movies, because you have absolutely no clue about movies period.",Terminator Genisys

Good fear to have :). Latest from such fear is this movie. Funny is back to future, future to back, switch between multiple futures, confusing to me but why I should understand the sequence, relationship. My motive is to enjoy the screen fights, chases.

Cameron's direction would have made it spectacular - I think we all know that - but this was still quite enjoyable. I loved all the little tie-ins they did with the first two films and squealed like the fangirl that I am each time a tie-in was apparent. One primary complaint I do have: Sarah's physique should have been similar to the one we saw in T2. At least a little. This Sarah didn't look like she'd even done one pull up. Emilia has very little - if any - muscle definition at all. Her acting wasn't stellar, but she did alright ... I often found myself forgetting she isn't American because she did a good job with the accent. Jai was decent as Kyle and Arnold was ... well, Arnold.

It really captured the essence of the story and the struggle for the survival of the human race. The actors looked as close to the original cast as you could probably get. The acting was spot on, they even worked some quotes, and a few forgotten characters from movies past, into the film, and they did it in a way where it wasn't cheesy or out of place. I thought it was worth the watch, Arnold is definitely not to old for this stuff yet, and I really hope to see another one in the near future since, like terminator 2, you can literally go in any direction from this point. I just hope that they don't go back downhill like they did with terminator 3 and the garbage that spun off of that mess.",Terminator Genisys

Performances were OK but the story was horrible and is filled with plot holes and lots of unexplained questions. They killed off all the best villains from the first two movies in less than half an hour, they totally ignore the T-X from the third movie, and show this knock off T-3000, which is just a lame version of the liquid metal terminator.They shouldn't have made this sequel. The trailer makes the movie look good but it isn't the case. Obviously their will be a sixth terminator, I hope. They kind of have to make a sixth one.

606,jviaes,WORST TERMINATOR EVER,1,25 May 2018,"Let's start with the fact that all actors (besides Arnold) look nothing like the original actors. I've always been a fan of the terminator series, but the fact that they basically messed with the timeline to pretty much create an entire new one is ridiculous.I found Sarah Conner's new persona to be annoying. Not that the actress portraying her didn't do a good job, but the fact that Kyle was supposed to protect her and it turns out she is protecting him is a real strain on the original concept. It really got under my skin when she throws open the door and says ""Come with me if you want to live.""What was most aggravating was the fact that they turned John into the bad guy. What on earth? You spend an entire franchise building up John Conner the hero only to turn him bad? It's almost like they wanted to kill the franchise.This was by far the most aggravating and painful Terminator even though the other films were really enjoyable.",Terminator Genisys
607,Wayne1138,Second best Terminator film by far and haters haven't got a clue........,9,4 July 2015,"Well after some so so trailers and people hating the film (even before release!!!???) I went to see this today in IMAX and although I had my doubts, it is an EXCELLENT sequel and is now my second favorite in the series after T2. Part prequel, sidequel and sequel all in one, but by the end, really becomes its own film.Firstly the good. Although the cast seem to be getting slated, they are really good in this. Emilia Clarke is brilliant as Sarah Connor and I actually preferred her to Linda Hamilton to be honest due to how her character is in this film, which I will come to in a minute. I'll be the first to admit that I cannot stand Jai Courtney as an actor but even he is good in the role of Kyle Reese. He is however no Michael Biehn. I really have to take my hat off to Arnie as well who is excellent in this. The whole 'age' thing doesn't matter as we all know he is a robot at the end of the day. A good supporting cast too with Jason Clarke playing a very different John Connor this time round as he is very latest model Terminator. JK Simmons was a bit wasted but Matt Smith played his role very well and I found him quite creepy to be honest. Rumour is he has a bigger role in the next one.I loved the story of the film which involves lots of time travel which always works well in science fiction if done properly and it does with this film. The Terminator vs Terminator battles in this are the best ever in the series and CGI Arnie at the start of the film (recreating scenes perfectly which takes place in the 1984 original) is just incredible. No end of advances have been made since TRON: Legacy where the 'de-aged' Jeff Bridges scenes were a bit hit and miss. With this film though they have really nailed it and CGI Arnie has been recreated perfectly. Its a shame they didn't do the same with Robert Patrick as Byung Hun Lee was a poor replacement for the T1000 to be honest. The scene on Golden Gate bridge was also excellent and stunning to watch. I also liked how they kept the human prisons pretty much the same as they were in Terminator Salvation. Some good nods here and there to the first two but all the while the film eventually becomes its own.I also loved how Sarah Connor is now what John was in T2 by having Arnie be her father figure just as he was to John in T2. She also shows the same love for Arnie and I thought it was a nice touch, especially towards the end.The bad points are very few in my book. People complaining about the helicopter scene which is a bit out of place but nowhere near as dumb or stupid as the third act in the past two Fast & Furious movies. As mentioned, the T1000 was a bit disappointing as he is only in the film at the start and Byung Hun Lee is no replacement for Robert Patrick. I did however like how he was destroyed in the film. Lastly, although Lorne Balfe and Hans Zimmer did a good score (the new version of the original Terminator theme over the end credits is EXCELLENT) its a shame Brad Fiedel didn't return to do the score. Especially with all the nods to the first film.So all in all a fantastic sequel with a cracking story and I really don't know why there is all the hate towards it as it was SO much better than I could have hoped for. Just like Jurassic World, this is an excellent sequel and I hope it doesn't disappoint at the box office as I would gladly watch another one set in this time line. Mid end credits scene as well setting up the sequel so hang around for that. 8/10.",Terminator Genisys

*Jai Courtney is severely miscast as Kyle Reese, lacking the seriousness and charisma of Michael Biehn's portrayal)
*the film's PG-13 rating like Salvation's, rather than being R-rated.
*the marketing campaign for the movie revealing arguably the BIGGEST twist in the trailers, the twist being that John Connor has been transformed into a villainous terminator himself.
*some of the campiness of the film is a bit cringeworthy at times (some of the jokes and misused callbacks to the earlier movies).
*the lack of using more practical effects than CGI, something the first 4 Terminator films were using pretty well.
*not being directed as a sequel to Terminator: Salvation. would have been nice to see a sense of continuity!the film comes in second-last place in the franchise for me, last place being Salvation. although there are a huge bunch of mistakes/flaws in the film, i can still really enjoy it after 5 years, like any Terminator movie really. the film gets a 7.5/10 from me, half a star more than Salvation. if you're going to go see this film, whether it be at a friend's, on DVD or somewhere on the internet - don't judge it by the standards of the previous, much better Terminator films (T1, T2) - watch it with low expectations and it'll sit with you a lot better!",Terminator Genisys
610,nvxx2004,Bread and Circuses,4,4 July 2015,"I am of the same age as the first Terminator and grew up with the first two movies. Even back then I didn't have illusions that it's somehow a science fiction, but I was taking Terminator movies with full seriousness and I still do, was empathizing with Sarah, Kyle or John and holding my breath each time a bad Terminator was entering the scene.Genisys is all different. It was an effort to stay in the chair until the movie ends. Arnie is old now, but I still like him acting, the plot was a scramble, but that's acceptable. It's all the rest that is different. I was always taking Terminator seriously. Even 'Rise of the Machines' and 'Salvation' keep the seriousness. But somehow nothing feels authentic in Genisys. Sarah and Kyle do not care about saving the mankind, but are concentrated only on their own feelings like careless teenagers. Flat jokes, ingenuous relationships in pair with poor acting break all the atmosphere of despair and seriousness.What's worrying the most, is the tendency. The same was with Jurassic World. Is it so, that nowadays a blockbuster needs to be a careless and flat action-movie to be successful in box office? I try not to believe in that. Guardians of the Galaxy was good, but not every movie needs to be that way, not the Terminator.""Bread and Circuses...""",Terminator Genisys

For the 2nd time we see the legendary John Connor in the real but this time so much more convincing.Jason Clarke has made his mark on this franchise and he should return for any planned sequels. He is very good in this role. I know some die hard fans unlike me may disagree but just imagine what a mess Christian Bale would have been if he was recast here.I love the concept although the nexus of events that happen and don't happen is confusing and a bit difficult to digest. One short coming is the human like behavior of Arnie's bot that is somewhat difficult to accept as no other bot is expected to have become self aware. For any sequels this should be addressed and replaced with the flat one liners of T:1.",Terminator Genisys
612,Sergio_Ivan_1985,A terminator comedy,3,29 June 2015,"This movie is a blast!, if you enter with the right frame of mind, that is: If you expect to see a comedy that doesn't know it is one.Everyone here is awful, except for Arnold and Jay Courtney; the first one because he's always great in this role, it's what he was born to play and he's stellar, as always. Jay Courtney because he's so, so bland that whatever he does he doesn't register, so he's not bad, just truly forgettable.As for the rest of the cast: Emilia Clarke isn't channeling Linda Hamilton, and that's OK, because trust me, she would NOT be able to do it. But she's channeling Edward Furlong, which is a wise move theoretically, but that sadly just has a pathetic effect.Jason Clarke: He's OK, It's just that the character he plays doesn't have no real motivation and or weight, the shock his betrayal to the cause should be really doesn't register, because they transform John Connor to a run of the mill villain and the way they explain what happens to him is just lazy storytelling.The plot makes no sense and effectively undoes every other Terminator movie before this, even the good ones, which is a move that's incredibly arrogant and dumb, more so because the contrived and ridiculous plot is really not as great as the hack writers clearly think it is. You can practically see them high fiving each other every time they come up with a cringe worthy twist and/or a ""homage"" to the original movies that they think it's so, SO clever.Please don't go see this movie, unless you go with the right frame of mind, i repeat: you need to have the tacit understanding that you're going to see a comedy that thinks it's the best movie not of the franchise, but EVER. Is hilarious that way and you are going to have a blast.Can't wait to the rights reversing to James Cameron in 2018, this franchise needs to be put to sleep.",Terminator Genisys
613,tcmay-1,"Happy with the film, saddened that it got negative reviews",8,9 July 2015,"I saw Terminator at age 32, and was much impressed. T2 followed about 7-8 years later and was even better.T3 and T4 (for want of better short names) were fairly boring. T3 was at least a bit entertaining, but T4 was pretentiously boring. T5, the new one, was very entertaining. The time travel paradoxes were paramount, but what else is to be expected? At least these are now being put out in front, prominently. I see a lot of promise in this.As for the less than stellar opening, I'm surprised. I didn't like the new ""Road Warrior"" movie much at all (I saw RW in 1982 and call the series by that name, not ""Mad Max""). Likewise, ""Jurassic World"" was fairly boring.I hope Terminator Genisys grows in recognition. I agree with Cameron that it's _the_ logical successor to T2. The paradoxes are a bit confusing, but, as I said, that's the nature of the beast. (I think some of the possible worlds semantics of Kripke and others is relevant, ""theoretically"" (ObArnold).It's the best movie I've seen so far this year.--Tim May, Corralitos, California",Terminator Genisys

What I like about this is that Arnold's terminator character isn't the main focus, rather this is a story about Sarah and Kyle. Arnold is there to give the film a legitimacy to the franchise.**Spoiler**After you see John Connor getting attacked by a T-5000 as Kyle is being sent back to 1984 you realise that the beginning of the film starts in an alternate timeline. This timeline was obviously altered when at some point after Terminator Salvation 2 terminators get sent to 1973 when Sarah Connor is 9 years old, one T-1000 assassin and one T-800 guardian. It's still a mystery as to who specifically sent the T-800 back to 1973. This is what I am expecting answers for in the sequels.Another indication that the film starts in an alternate timeline is how John Connor and Kyle first meet. It's completely different to how it happens in Terminator Salvation.",Terminator Genisys

Depends on how you look at it.either way, good movie, well worth the money spent.all those who say this ruins their childhood movies etc need to learn that nowadays there is every good series is going to be ""rebooted"" and as for a reboot, this was and is a good good movie.",Terminator Genisys
617,Calenture,Oh my god...,1,1 November 2015,"***This review might contain spoilers (but frankly nothing I could do here would be worse than the appalling mess that the scriptwriters and director have already made of this film)***Others here have had the patience to carefully note the many (many) reasons this film fails. I became so confused by the plot, which is not so much labyrinthine as just plain muddled, confused and contrived, that the only thing that kept me watching was a morbid curiosity to see if it could possibly get worse. It did.There were warning signs even before Jai Courtney stepped into the time machine. The conversation between Courtney and Jason Clarke had already become mawkishly sentimental. When Courtney asks Clarke how Sarah Connor will know he's speaking the truth, Clarke reels off a speech half a page long that he's supposed to remember and recite to her.I watched the movie with a friend, and at one point asked him if he was still following the plot. ""Dunno mate,"" he said. ""I gave up on it long ago.""We see Big Arnie's Terminator arriving naked in the past and meeting itself. The ensuing fight between Terminators is just embarrassing. It's so obviously CGI, and very poor CGI at that. Hell, the CGI rendition of Oliver Reed in Gladiator, 15 years ago, was more convincing. Emilia Clarke was a hopelessly wrong choice to play Sarah Connor. She looks far too young and soft. When she strips in front of Jai Courtney, I wondered if the filmmakers were about to add kiddie porn to their list of transgressions. And she definitely didn't look strong enough to take the weight of the heavy artillery or its recoil!And the dialogue. At one point Emilia Clarke says to Jason Clarke, ""What are you going to do? Talk us to death?"" Yeah, right.As for the helicopter chase... that was so incompetent. To spell it out, a helicopter is a very unstable flying machine. Tip one over the edge of a building and it won't stop until it hits the street. Watching Bruce Willis jump off a building onto a jet fighter's wing was ludicrous but entertaining in Live Free or Die Hard - and it was brilliantly filmed. The helicopter sequence in Terminator Genisys is just ludicrous.The most worrying thing is that, once again, the ending is left open for yet another sequel. Really, people, don't do it! Look at what's happened with Ex Machina. That's how to make a film about robots. If you must make another Terminator, make it a cartoon, then we'll know what age group it's directed at.",Terminator Genisys

The writers obviously did not get that memo and continue to stretching the plot. Speaking of the plot, it doe not make sense, the time lines are so twisted and uncordinated that i give up on asking why. I am sure there is more then one scientist somewhere who is shaking in disbelieve about this movie plot. Plot aside let's review the acting or lack of it and the actor selection. Why did Sara Connor got shorter and fatter? Hollywood is littered with actresses that looked a bit more like Linda Hamilton the original Sara Connor. I totally understand the fact that this is is younger version of Sara but lets face it, the younger version of Terminator looks like him where younger version of Sara is anything but.",Terminator Genisys

Oh no, I just realized I've given them a Terminator 6 synopsis.

621,imim123,A Great Popcorn Movie,7,6 September 2015,"I am not a big fan of the Terminator Series and I've only watched the first and the second ""Terminator"" before. Since I understand that this sequel movie is produced because Hollywood wants to make more money out of the Terminator Series, I already lowered my expectation before I entered the cinema. But to my surprise, when I came out of the movie theater after watching it, I actually felt quite happy and relaxed. To make it clear, my only motivation to buy the ticket to this movie was to refresh myself after five days' hard working. In this sense, what I was expecting is exciting actions scenes that keeps audience on their toes and some funny and stupid jokes which can take away all of my pressure and anxiety of work, not an artful, subtle little movie. To that purpose, ""Terminator Genisys "" has severed me well.Arnold Schwarzenegger give great performance in this movie as a hard-core machine killer, once again. If I remember correctly, he is almost 70 year old. Though I still hear criticism of his acting method, but anyone who can pull off a blockbuster like this at the age of 70 is someone who deserves my respect. Besides, from What I am seeing, I don't think He has aged much since ""Terminator 1"". The makeup team's excellent work and Schwarzenegger's whole-hearted performance made it possible for us to enjoy yet another Terminator movie.Emilia Clarke is one of several highlights in this movie. I still can't shake her performance in ""Game of Throne"" as the dragon queen Daenerys Targaryen out of my head, especially when both of the characters are strong-minded woman with ambition. Though her problem of overacting still exists in this movie, It doesn't influence my affections for her. Actually she is one of biggest reasons why I chose this movie.In summary, if you are looking for a popcorn movie which can refresh yourself, this movie is a good pick. However if what you are expecting an artful movie which subvert the classic Terminator Series, I suggest you choose deliberately in case of possible disappointment.",Terminator Genisys
622,agsteribbe,TerminatorS come see them all,7,29 September 2015,"Arnold is at it again , at the respectable age of 68 and still manages to pull it off, though he is one of the few characters in this movie that actually feels as if he belongs there.It's a great popcorn movie to watch lots of explosions, fights and a reasonable story all make the 2 hours running time fly past. However it does have it's share of problems biggest one is the miscasting of Sarah Conner in this installment.Remember Linda Hamilton from the previous movies ? Her charisma, strength and borderline insanity just oozed from the screen making her a perfect match for the dangers that were lurking around each and every corner. In Genisys however, Emilia Clarke plays the role of Sarah and it just does not work. She is pretty , attractive, but there is no strength , charisma or dedication in her performance she is ""just"" a girl not a worthy adversary for the truckloads of terminators on her tail. Together with a really bad makeup job on John Connor, this is a little distracting.But all in all, the movie still works the fights, the Schwarzenegger and some humor make for a good and entertaining watch. As with all these movies, switch off brain, hand in popcorn, and be entertained !Side-note : Why is it o.k. to show so much violence in a movie and not o.k. to see two people naked ? The camera really has a hard time to avoid Emilia's breasts and Jai's male parts. Shame such movies are not made in Europe as naturally showing people distracts way less from the story than awkwardly trying to avoid showing any skin. Grow up USA.",Terminator Genisys
623,sparkytb,Everything that is wrong with the summer blockbuster in one neat steaming pile,1,20 November 2015,"This is a bloated Hollywood turd produced by a group of people that don't give a s**t about the audience. And that means YOU, my friends.A misguided, over complicated, redundant, profoundly immature and unfocused piece of Hollywood product created by a hapless group of individuals who appear to have absolutely no idea how to craft a coherent story or create characters we care about.TERMINATOR GENYSIS is a incoherent mess. Structurally it is built around a dozen or so expensive action sequences that hoodwink the audience into believing they're watching a story simply because the filmmakers possess the money and resources to create something visually arresting.Said action beats are then interspersed with tedious, extended sequences of appallingly written expository dialogue that stops the story dead in its tracks in order to explain stuff that we already know or don't care about. Screen writing for the hard of understanding.Never in living memory have I witnessed a film that spends so much time explaining its story -- that in the end there's no time left for a story.Oh how I longed for the beautiful and direct simplicity of James Cameron's original screenplay. A world in which the story unfolded before us and the characters at the same time. A world in which the writer was confident enough in that story he didn't need to stop every ten minutes to explain stuff we might not have understood. A world in which he didn't have $20m to spend on each action sequence so opted for things like clarity of storytelling and beautiful sleight of hand. And used dialogue that was sparing and to the point.The dialogue in TERMINATOR GENYSIS is reminiscent of an early 1980s network TV show, with scenes between Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor that are SO BAD the producers of THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL would have laughed them out of the writer's room.And then, to top it all, the third act of this travesty actually asks us to care for the plight of these people when the movie has done nothing to earn it. We are then forced to endure a syrupy final scene where Arnold and his friends drive off into a photograph from the front of a box of chocolates, and then at the end of the credits this abortion of a motion picture threatens us with the possibility of yet more to come.Personally I would rather eat my own arm than see a sequel to this film. Life is just too beautiful to waste. It is time for us to stop giving our money and our time to the purveyors of this simplistic, calculated garbage. It is time to stop giving attention to people whose only concern is ""what are the weekend numbers?"" and ""how did it do in China?"". It is time to start telling these people that we, your audience, are not stupid -- and we will not take it anymore.",Terminator Genisys

But in this case, Hollywood is recycling the same story AND actors to try to tap into all those Anuld fans to ensure it's gonna be another blockbuster of yesteryear. Only problem is that most of his target audience have grown-up and evolved, when sadly Anuld has not, is an embarrassment to society for the way he treats women, and left his last gig in disgrace.Which is why this movie fails on all accounts, except for the usual dazzling CGI James Cameron's crew that are mind blowing.",Terminator Genisys
629,wpedmonson,A middle of the road installment for the Terminator franchise,7,7 July 2015,"As a moderately strong fan of the Terminator franchise who was disappointed by the last two installments, I was skeptical of the latest that came out last week. Two Arnolds? More time traveling cris-crosses? Kyle Reese again? When it's all said and done though, I'd say it worked as a middle of the pack movie amongst the five that make up the franchise. The story begins minutes before the battle referenced in the first Terminator movie occurs where John Connor and Kyle Reese along with the human resistance army are defeating the machines in a final skirmish to end the war. Reese is sent back exactly as it happened in the first movie, though there's a glitch where Connor is attacked seconds before he travels back to 1984. This attack changes all of what happens next, similar to what was done in the Star Trek reboot a few years back. Same characters, different plot. This technique has become the weapon of choice when trying to please old and new audiences with a reboot of a popular franchise. Sarah Connor is not the one we know from the first movie, she's waiting with Arnold as the Terminator with her to kill his machine clone and save Kyle Reese. A T-1000 unit is also after them which they're ready for and easily dispense with. Things are different though when Reese recalls a memory from his new childhood past (the past and future are now different that Connor was attacked), and has to convince Sarah to change their travel date. The main tension of the movie is between Reese and Sarah Connor, which is a welcome change to the previously bleak and macho takes on the story in 3 and 4. Kyle Reese always struck me as one of the better characters along with Sarah Connor, and they work somewhat well together in this movie. Jai Courtney doesn't deliver the performance Michael Biene does, neither great actors for the part (though I liked Courtney in Divergent), and the crucial miss for him is in the youthful sadness of Reese having to grow up in a war ravaged future that Biene did a good job of portraying in the first movie. The story jumps to three different time settings, which could be confusing for some audiences, and wins the movie the award for most time traveling for a Terminator movie. The tension between soldier Sarah from the 80s, soldier Kyle Reese from the future, and our time is possibly the most interesting part of the movie. The film struggles, though, with what issue it wants to take on from our time and ends up settling for a bland mix of top of mind issues like social media, cellphone ubiquity, and homeland security. On this front, the story offers nothing new for audiences and is one reason why it's receiving poor reviews. Where it does work though, is in the relationship of Sarah and Kyle now having to live with each other and be pressured to fall in love after knowing they're supposed to give birth to John Connor. At best, the relationship is a love story of two people thrown in together who want to have an attraction and certainly do, but pressures from multiple fronts complicate and threaten that. This is a very relatable aspect of the movie. The part that doesn't work is the heavy-handedness of the feminism injected in the movie (another common issue movies in our time tackle that has become stale) that seems like a message about both abortion choice and career choice for women. The emergence of this theme in the movie points toward the preponderance of it in the movies of our time, and to further prove the point, just look at the media hype around Mad Max and Jurassic World. For Terminator Genisys, though, this theme comes across as boring and awkward for the couple. Overall the movie is a welcome addition to the franchise though it's unlikely the movie will regain the greatness of the first two installments. Mad Max will be the critical reboot winner of the summer while Jurassic World will be the popular one. I'm OK with how this ended up.",Terminator Genisys
630,pattmayne,Weakest Re-Hash Ever!,1,2 July 2015,"I came in with low expectations, but this was far worse than I feared.I didn't expect the visionary sci-fi horror that James Cameron once delivered. I just wanted a cool action movie with lots of robot-smashing fun. Sadly, the action sequences relied on explicitly copying ideas and sequences from the previous films and delivering them boringly. Some people have called this a ""throw-back"" or homage to the originals. It's really just a lack of imagination.The dialogue is horrible. The actors and actresses do a pretty great job of pretending to care, but the relationships and character-building could have been devised by a junior high kid. The awkward ""romance"" that builds between Reese and Connor is just uncomfortable. Connor's love for her robotic caretaker fails to be heart-warming. Schwarzenegger's attempts at humour are very lame and cringe-worthy.In this film nobody is a bad-ass. Sarah Connor seems like a kid pretending to be Sarah Connor. Kyle Reese seems like a decent actor struggling through a weak role.I cheered for the bad guy in this movie. (Spoilers ahead) John Connor gets assimilated by a weird next-gen robot who creates a hybrid made of some kind of nanobots and human flesh. When I saw that I thought, ""This is true evolution... a human machine!"" He's not out to kill them. He's out to assimilate them.

Mediocre action sequences but amazing visual effects, for sure.As for the acts, Arnold was doing alright. But Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor? Really? I get the fact she's doing great as Khalisi in GoT but she looked like a troubled teenager rather than a fighting, soul scratching, messed up mother in this movie, IMO.All in all, an average Terminator movie sequel.

Audiences would never have thought that from the trailer. His T-800 shows more intelligence and becomes a more lovable father figure type, a personality Schwarzenegger executed with his own type of grace, believe it or not.The story for ""Terminator Genisys"" was captivating, somewhat fresh, not confusing and implemented quite well at the proper times. Nostalgia of the 1984 original was at an all time high for the first half and hour of the film, for reasons you will have to see on your own, no spoilers here. Ultimately a little of each of the previous Terminator films were sprinkled throughout, some even combining them all together at once.The action was pretty effective throughout the two hour and five minute running time, lots of cool explosions and sound editing was pretty amazing. Visually there were ups and downs, but nothing like I was prepared for.Overall, I really did have a blast watching ""Terminator Genisys.The costars – including Byung-Hun Lee as the new T-1000, Matt Smith, JK Simmons, and Courtney B. Vance – are fun to see. But it's really the action set pieces, massive detonations, and all-out hand-to-hand combat that are the real stars of Terminator Genisys.The blend of top-notch CGI, realism, stunts, and breakneck pace keep all the exploding balls in the air, and the 3D is blissfully easy on the eyes.'ve always loved the story and the time travelling aspect, this did the trick and I believe did a justice to the series even though most would disagree with me there.

633,wow3,Not bad,6,26 June 2015,"Before going in I read some reviews that really pounded this movie so I didn't expect all that much. The movie seemed quite neutral to me. It had no great moments but not really bad moments either. I expected Arnold to show off more and be obnoxious for being the Man but he was professional to the end. Casting of Sarah Connor was off though. The lady did try but didn't quite fill the spot. One part maybe, at least to me, was that she looked very small-framed and small in general against the others. Those paying homage moments were close of being a slap to the face of the fans but pulled off nicely. In general the line between paying homage and ripping off is getting blurry these days. I'd like to see something new for a change. The plot wasn't that hard to follow and I think the point was not to even try. At this point there are so many people and terminators in the past that no-one can't keep up. What also bothers me is that just about every movie seems like a copy of all the others. Every movie has cities being destroyed and huge explosions all around. Those events no longer seem interesting. For once I'd like to get a good story.In conclusion I'd say it's not a bad movie but I also wouldn't wan't to see it again. It just didn't stand out in any way.

635,chasebangerter,An Underwhelmed Sci-Fi Reboot,5,26 November 2015,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the veteran Terminator as we have our fifth installment in the franchise: Terminator Genysis. The first two movies were really good as they were influential to the action and sci-fi genres. This movie, however, is nowhere near as good as the first two. The story in this movie is extremely confusing to the point where I wonder if the screenwriters have any idea what's going on. Not only is the plot super convoluted as the story goes on, but it's not really that interesting. The characters doesn't really do a whole lot for me, even though I know that the actors are trying their best. The best parts of the movie is that Arnold Schwarzenegger is entertaining as the aged Terminator and some of the action scenes are actually well handled and nice to look at. But it's own script and story doesn't really help it a whole lot and it comes off as just uninspiring. While not the worst movie, it could've been a whole lot more. This is definitely a skip.",Terminator Genisys
636,htpalmer-1,Seriously? Hasta la vista fools.,1,6 August 2019,"I'm stunned this over-priced piece of junk was made and it made money!!!
This was the most unimaginative mess I've seen in quite a long time and there's many out there.
It wasn't even ""so bad,"" it was entertaining. This junk is a masterclass in how to make a terrible movie, if one could call it that. The tongue-in-cheek lines have grown idiotic and tiring. Everything in this movie is a complete mess from the over-acting, directing(really Alan Taylor?-the lucre must've been to big to pass up), the cliched and lazily written script just defies explanation. Did the studios get involved? The producers? How explain this drivel ever not just being made but released!
Oh, right, it's ALL about the money.
All I can say is this, ""I won't be back.""",Terminator Genisys
637,ericwatkinson,An Unmemorable Reboot,4,17 August 2015,"Both Terminator 2 & 3 set the bar extremely high, so it is easy to be disappointed by any film following in the foot steps of these two very great films. Although Terminator Genisys appears to briefly recapture some of the magic of the very first Terminator movie, during its alternate 1984 sequence, for the most part the film seems to lack any of the suspense that made the earlier films so great. Unfortunately, however, the somewhat dull nature of the film is exacerbated by the terribly stiff wooden acting on the part of the Sarah Connor, John Connor, and Kyle Reese characters. Although Schwarzenegger playing the part of an aging Terminator is occasionally interesting, it simply isn't enough to carry the entire film. Additionally the action sequences are brief and sporadic at best, and when they do occur, they completely lack the wow factor found in Terminators 2 & 3. Additionally, Terminator Genisys almost hits rock bottom during a fight sequence occurring between Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 character, and the augmented John Connor character inside the Genisys factory, and at certain points the John Connor villain is clearly an actor in a rubber suit! The overall premise of the story line is merely average at best, and at certain point it feels as though a bunch of studio executives, not familiar with the franchise, had their way with the script (the end of the film is both confusing and disappointing). Although Arnold delivers a solid performance in his role, the film feels too much like a cheap Hollywood money grab, and in many ways it reminds me of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Alien 3, or one of the Alien vs. Predator films (I'm not lying). With so many fans out there willing to shell out their hard earned money, I'm puzzled as to why the folks in Hollywood aren't willing to hire a real director, writers, and actors for such a well respected franchise?",Terminator Genisys
638,robinmyrobin,Outstanding Movie,10,6 April 2016,"This movie is as good or better than the first and second Terminator movies. Emilia Clarke was so outstanding that I had to Google her to make sure she was the person who also appears in Game of Thrones.I am SO happy I never saw a trailer for this movie before watching it. Instead, I saw the trailer after the movie and it was so disappointing that the trailer gave away the entire movie. If any one is disappointed in the movie I will bet it is because they already knew what to expect before they saw it. What makes a movie entertaining for a lot of us is the element of surprise.I loved that this movie had a lot of ""call backs"" for lack of a better term to the older versions. Classic lines from older versions such as, ""I'll be back, and ""Get out"" were artfully used in this version.This movie is what a sequel should be: It was a great reminder of the past movies but it was a strong movie all on it's own.",Terminator Genisys
639,EISMediaGroup,My thoughts on the Terminator story-line in its entirety,10,3 July 2017,"Firstly, I am giving this movie a 10/10 solely based on the highly innovative concepts regarding time travel and the captivating story-line regarding the Skynet system.My thoughts on the Terminator story-line as a whole are as follows:There is no reason whatsoever for John Connor to have sent Kyle Reese into the year 1984 in the first place. The humans won the battle against the machines, and skynet was decimated. Skynet sending a terminator back in time to dispose of Sarah Connor was a computer glitch at best made by a desperate, destroyed and condemned artificial intelligence unit. Alternate timelines are a moot point in this regard because the present war had already ended. The logistics of a highly technical, highly contentious, and already decided war being altered in any capacity by something as far fetched as ""time travel"" are impossible to attain.In the movie ""The Terminator"" (1984), the war was already won, and humankind was delivered from Skynet's oppression of them. The terminator sent back in time by Skynet to kill Sarah Connor was already doomed to fail solely based on the present victory that humankind had already won.John Connor sent Kyle Reese back in time because Connor wanted to further engage the skynet system as a precaution, but this action was not necessary. Even in the movie ""Terminator 2"" (1991), as captivating a movie as it was, was unnecessary in the ""Terminator"" timeline becausethe T-1000 in particular and Skynet in general had already failed in their mission of human domination. The resistance beat Skynet already and won the war. Again, the T-800 terminator sent by the present John Connor to guard Sarah Connor and a young John Connor was done as a precaution, but was not necessary.All other movies and TV shows in the Terminator franchise do not avert ""Judgement Day"" or change the fact that Skynet is beaten in 2029. There can never be a ""deleted"" or ""altered"" timeline of events because there can only be one ""timeline"" ever in history and that is the timeline that actually ""results"" in something namely documented history.Lastly I would like to address Kyle Reese as the ""father"" of John Connor. This is not a physical possibility. John Connor was 44 when he beat Skynet and sent Kyle Reese back in time. Kyle Reese was only 27. A son cannot be older than his Father.Sarah Connor was already pregnant with John Connor (perhaps by Stan Morsky) when she ""met"" Kyle Reese in 1984. Kyle and Sarah's sexual encounter in the Tiki Motel produced no children.Overall, the Terminator franchise sparks the imagination and human contemplation like no other movie franchise in history. The screenplay and story writers have done a brilliant job in keeping people interested in the series of events in this franchise, and the franchise has done superbly in ticket sales, DVD sales, video game sales, and merchandise sales. In spite of the commercial success of this franchise however, I believe that the franchise overall has become cumbersome and repetitive in its formula and could use a fresher, more definitive, and more conclusive approach in its storytelling and narrative.",Terminator Genisys
640,shivamdutta-99811,Timeline is confusing,8,7 November 2019,The first two movies of terminator franchise is very good but after that the movies that come is average after average respectively.Bit the terminator genesys had a twist.....but it will be really confusing for you to understand the timeline in this movie......bcoz there is alternate timeline.....but the background score is awesome and in some scenes actions are awesome.....but the casting director alawys change the character in each and every movie after the movie terminator judgement day....this the disadvantage of this movie....if the real character is playing those roles like sarah connor for linda hamilton etc... I think the direcotrt should include real adn natural character in this film and the acting of arnold scwarzennegr is awsm and he try so hard for his acting.,Terminator Genisys
641,avriapocalypse,Entertaining but somewhat still a recycled homage,5,2 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys - Review. * Warning* *Spoilers*.OK, I haven't done a film review in a long time but Terminator has long been one of my Favorite guilty pleasures. I even enjoyed some parts about the horrible Rise Of The Machines, & Salvation.After seeing all the promo stuff, Entertainment magazine, web spots, trailers, etc..I stayed far away. When I saw the Asian actor playing T- 1000, (who looked dead on) I was kind of curious. First off, I have to say all the actors did exceptionally well. Sexy ass Emilia Clarke looked like a hot ass kid with lady humps. Wtf? Lol. I felt the same way I did when I saw Ellen Page raping the other character in SUPER. Lol. She tries so hard to channel Linda Hamilton but comes off more like Eddie Furlong in T2. I guess that kind of works..she is his mom in the story. She sort of looks like a young Linda at times.I think Jai Cortney and funny faced Dr. Who's Jason Clarke were horribly miscast. I can forgive Jai Courtney a bit, but Jason Clarke looks NOTHING like a John Connor!!! Again, acting wise, they did exceptionally well. Most of my beef with this film is mainly technical issues, but I was mostly entertained. Originally, I expected the worst but was utterly surprised.OK, In the opening during the scene when Kyle is walking up to the time machine, he has pants on, next clip no pants!! Not even a hunch over to give hint that he had gotten rid of them. OK then.Later, we see The CGI recreation of Arnold from T1. Bet you can guess where they got this idea..Close up, it looks good for a moment until he fights old Arnie (who makes no sense being in the film at all) then it just looks like the Ang Lee version of The Hulk!! Cartoonish!! Jeesh!Back to old Arnie..how the f**k can a android or cyborg age? I know why they did it, but realistically, I had to just turn my thinking brain off.Here's another.. Sarah Connor comes back to her own secret base and gets burned by her own acid trap she has set up for a Terminator attack? Um.. okay.. So there was no other way to explain that she had an acid trap for the machines? Wow.I think T-1000 should have had more screen time. This movie aims to make us cautious about the fact that we all rely on technology lots. It's under toning message is that there is a real danger being that we are all connected via tablets and cell phones, etc.. This could be possible. So far so good. It hints on the thought that tech and machines are taking over but never really delves deep into it.I guess the writers have been studying the last few X-men films and said ""Hey, Terminator is based on time travel, instead of just a prequel, we can copy those films and tie the original films together and still be a homage to Cameron's work"".Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the film, but nothing new or groundbreaking here. The writers and director needs to REALLY make this their own all be it using the blueprint that Cameron laid down. It's like all the recycled bull we already know about the series but slightly watered down.""Come with me if you want to live"" & ""I'll be back"" seems to have lost it's punch!!Just like X-Men: Future's Past, this edition plays like a what if story. The worst possible scenarios. Again, still entertaining but a bit lackluster. By the way, Arnold continually saying ""I'm Old"" in EVERY movie is getting a bit tiring. Yeah, dude, we got the picture when you left office.Oh well. If you're a die hard Terminator fan like myself, it's worth a check out. Just keep in mind it's a worst possible scenarios story.👍👍1/2.-Avri's review.",Terminator Genisys
642,boyznick,A sequel tries to justify its existence,4,9 August 2015,"Terminator Genisys is a long waited sequel after Terminator Salvation. Part of me wanted them to continue where they left off. Nevertheless I really admired the effort of Director Alan Taylor, recapturing the magic of the original 1984 arrival scene with combination of impressive visual effects but that's pretty much what I liked about the film..Spoilers aheadThe film started off with again the narration of the future war which was repeated again for the 5th time.. We get it, the humans, known as the resistance, are fighting against Skynet... the only good thing is we finally get to see the time displacement machine.. By the time Kyle Reese arrived 1984, everything has changed. Sarah Connor knows exactly who Kyle Reese is and is already a trained warrior. However if they already have the knowledge to the dark future, couldn't they do a better preparation in defeating the terminators (T800 and T1000)? Pops (Old T-800) only brought with him a shotgun and the acid trap nearly failed... We are introduced to an alternative timeline, what happened to the old timeline? Is it completely erased or does it co-exist? Kyle Reese now possessed memories to a life he never lived. This whole timeline fractured reminds me of the time travel in the TV series Sarah Connor Chronicles.. I really like the idea of John Connor being compromised, this would have been a very nice twist IF they didn't spoil it in the trailer.. Just like the alternate ending in Terminator Salvation, Marcus Wright was given John Connor's face to continue to lead the human resistance against Skynet. That would add new life to the series and huge impact to the sequel.. Instead John Connor/T3000 is dead I assumed and Pops had been upgraded to T1000 likeMany fans like myself are wondering who send Pops back to 1973? I guess we will just have to wait for the sequel assuming if they are still pursuing one after the disappointing box office.To conclude Terminator Genisys could have been a much better film if the filmmaker aren't rushing for sequels before the completion of this film..",Terminator Genisys
643,graydevelopment,Good Summer Fun!!!,8,4 July 2015,"Not sure why all the hating about this movie. Terminator Genisys was a lot of fun and Arnie was awesome and down right hilarious at times. The plot was believable and the special effects are not cheesy and over dramatic. The movie starts a little predictable and slow, but when you get into the red meat in the middle, it has all kinds of juicy flavor. I'm not saying its T2 quality, but it has a lot more than Salvation had and definitely was better than T3. So to summarize, the movie is fun and is worth the 2 hours of your life. It was far better than Avengers: Age of Ultron was. Just FYI. So, I can understand if this movie doesn't receive accolades from every critic out there, but to say its a bad movie would be an injustice. This movie was far better than many other movies I have seen recently. So go ahead and get to the theater already.",Terminator Genisys
644,matthewaos,It's exactly what you are waiting for,4,20 August 2015,"This is really nothing special. The first terminator film was a sci fi thriller that haunted my dreams as a child (especially considering I was born in 1984). The second was an action movie, brighter and more optimistic. The third a bad dream. The forth was a different kind of monster, a post apocalyptic adventure. Considering that ""Salvation"" created two camps, haters and lovers, the franchise was dying. The rights to it go back to Cameron in 2019 and he can reboot it as he see fit, for the new generation, or sell it or whatever.So the producers said ""Let's not make anything stupid and make something that most people will love"". This is a terminator movie with all the clichés, but not a parody of itself as T3 was, new elements are introduced but not groundbreaking to the franchise as ""Salvation"" did (love it or hate you have to admit that it was something very different) and it is a good action movie like T2 was. It has many nods to the original film and some hiding in plain sight from all the other installments (plus the TV series) for the fanboys to be happy about it.Let's be frank: When you make a Terminator movie with arnie in 2015 best bet is that you don't make it for those who want to see a good crafted movie with meanings. You make it as a money-cow for people who are now in their 30s or 40s and want to relieve their childhood. This is a cool action movie with no surprises. It is not bad but I would not recommend it to you.",Terminator Genisys
645,HeliosZg,Makes me hungry for the next two sequels.,8,6 July 2015,"I am a Terminator and Arnold fan and have been following announcements, trailers and everything else about this movie for pretty long, so I kind of knew what to expect and went into the cinema pretty hyped. Although not as scary and revolutionary as T2, this PG-13 Terminator movie has managed to spark my interest with its plot twists, at times stunning visuals and good actors. The strongest point in my opinion are definitely the plot twists that make you want to see the (hopefully still on track) next two sequels for answers. Some are smart, some are flat out random and I can't wait to see how they are explained in future movies. All in all, I think it's a strong script, it didn't make me bored or roll my eyes at any point, it kept me interested from start to finish. I like the actors, Arnold, Emilia and Jai (such a hunk!) are a fun, emotional and ass-kicking team. Jason Clarke and Lee Byung-hun (special shout out to him from this K-pop fan) are also great additions. And I was thrilled to hear that Jane Zhang is doing the theme song, yay for Asians! :) The action and effects were good, although, I hope they bring it to a larger scale in future sequels. I felt like it was all a bit too small (but, only a bit), compared to T3 and Salvation. The sets are smaller, the chases and fights less bombastic. The CGI Arnold was absolutely amazing, though! The fight choreography on the other hand... not so much. That's what I'm saying. I really hope this movie gets enough support and some amazeballs sequels are made. Arnold is a legend and Terminator is a classic and I don't want it to die. (Also, I really don't get why people are supporting all them dinosaur, stripper and cartoon movies more than this. This deserves equally as much support, at least!) If you're a regular cinema goer or a sci-fi/Terminator fan, definitely go see it! I'd hate to see this end prematurely, like the brilliant Sarah Connor Chronicles did!",Terminator Genisys
646,ericvr,Awesome!!!! i LOVED IT...,10,30 June 2015,"All I can is... this is a great movie. Long time Terminator fans, you will not be disappointed. It's not disjointed; its just smart and unpredictable.Arnold was an 15 out of 10. The two leads (no spoilers) had great chemistry. Sure there were some implausible parts, but who cares. This is the ultimate popcorn movie with heart, laughs and guts. After reading a few low nerd reviews, I almost got discouraged and was going to see something else. I am so glad I went! I will definitely see it a few times in the theatres and then buy it keepsake - add it to the T collection. It was totally CLASSIC. It was way better than the last one for sure. GO ENJOY THE MOVIE!!!!! Hasta la vista baby...",Terminator Genisys
647,onthefloorthere,Wat.,5,5 July 2015,"Quite convinced this could be the worst film in the franchise. While nostalgia for the very first Ts shouldn't blur reasonable judgment, ""Genisys"" is very, very, very far from the vibe of the original and T2. Why it could be the worst ? Creatively speaking, there's nothing new here. Everything in ""Genisys"" is recycled. There is not a single fresh idea or theme introduced; the whole thing seemed like memorable bits from previous films taken and glued together to produce an utter mess of a plot. The gaps between those are filled with bizarre sentimental dialogue moments which feel completely alien to the background. Some of the lines were outright cringe- worthy. The final result is a choppy story that leaves an unpleasant aftertaste and makes you wonder if you actually watched a Terminator movie. Technically speaking, the execution is just poor. Cinematography is inadequate and teams up with equally bad CGI to ruin the already limited action capital of the movie. The soundtrack is surprisingly unremarkable as well. ""Genisys"" has a few fresh elements, like Byung-hun Lee's T-1000, J.K. Simmons' O'Brien character and Skynet's AI linked to an omnipresent Internet of things. None of those is developed in sufficient depth though. Changes that could have been good but came out badly were John Connor's switch of sides and Arnold's previously sinister T-800 being reduced to comic relief. The former is obnoxious and the latter is just as sad as it is symbolic for the whole film. Overall it's a 5/10. ""Genisys"" is entertaining if you go without expectations or if you are not a fan of earlier Terminator movies. But it's also bad enough to put an end to a (prematurely) depleted franchise.",Terminator Genisys
648,thegreatwhy-312-879122,Not a bad movie after all,7,3 December 2015,"I have been hesitant to watch this because the quality of the franchise started falling right after the first, and Genisys was immediately met with bad press. I was wrong. It's not a bad movie at all, and not just that: it's actually the only movie in the franchise that makes sense as a sequel of the original (though Judgement day was a better movie). In fact, someone who isn't familiar with The Terminator can just watch the first and this one. The plot got simply rid of any continuity issues by just straight up kicking out the concept of continuity. Not only as a solution it's quick and effective, it's also perfectly justified by the simple fact that there are people freaking jumping in and out of time machines and messing everything up. The John Connor character actually gives a very effective explanation of this (by accident) in one of his monologues (he really talks too much). The movie is quick, rather funny and action-packed. The cast is convincing and the effects are, well, today's effects (except for the helicopter chase. That thing was fake as hell). Someone decent at video editing could easily repack it into 90 awesome minutes by removing the cringe-worthy moments and irrelevant plot points (some out of place attempts at humor, Reese's double memories and kid Reese, some of the clumsiest romantic bits), but even as it stands now it's really not bad.",Terminator Genisys
649,jimmylace,"An enjoyable, revisionist sequel that undoes the damage of previous movies.",6,3 July 2015,"In short, Terminator:Genisys is a ""best movie possible"" scenario considering it stars a 67 year old Arnold Schwarzenegger and is geared to compete with the likes of Marvel. It also has to work hard to undo the misstep of Terminator:Salvation. The plot twists and turns at pace, written in a modern, highly ""active"" style, with some clever scene construction. Arguably, the conditions in Hollywood just aren't there to produce a great Terminator movie anymore. (You could draw parallels between Genisys and Die Hard 4.0 or the Robocop remake in terms of a softened tone) Equally, the Terminator series has had little story reason to exist beyond the first entry. If you take the above on board,there's still a lot of fun to be had in this inventive, revisionist sequel. Emilia Clarke's Sarah Connor is a compelling mix of T1 and T2 Sarah, particularly enjoyable to watch her bounce off of ""Pops"" and Kyle. In it's own right, it's no classic however it sets the stage for a potentially interesting trilogy.",Terminator Genisys
650,mistergutsy2299,As Lifeless as a T-600,4,18 November 2015,"If there's one thing we can learn from Terminator Genisys it's that this is not the way to revive an aging franchise. If you thought Terminator 3 and Terminator Salvation were bad trust me buddy, you haven't seen anything yet.So Terminator Genisys is the fifth installment in the Terminator series, and it follows the sequel/reboot road that seems to be popular these days. The story this time around is Kyle Reese (this time around played by Jai Courtney) is sent back in time to protect Sarah Connor (played by Emilia Clarke), the women who will birth John Connor, the future leader of the resistance against killer cyborgs, the Terminators. But when Kyle arrives he finds that the past has changed, creating a radically different time-line. And here begins the movie's problems. First of all the plot is horrific. The film's main plot involves our protagonists attempting to stop Skynet from being launched, well let's see where have we seen that before? Better Terminator movies than this one have already shown us this plot twice. It doesn't help that the story is an incoherent mess that relies way too much on time travel technobabble and alternate timelines. I guarantee you that not a single person completely understood this film's story and anyone with even the most minuscule understanding of the rules of time travel will be able to spot many gaping plot holes in this movie.But hey maybe the actors can save the movie right? Maybe there's a worthwhile performance in here Terminator Salvation at least had Christian Bale's talent. How about this one? If there was a single word that could describe the performances of the entire new cast it would be the word bland.Every single performance in this movie (with the exception of JK Simmons) is delivered so unmemorable and robotic that the actors themselves could have been Terminators in disguise. Kyle Reese is a whiny and unlikeable moron, Emilia Clarke is trying her hardest to be tough as Sarah Connor but I couldn't take her seriously because of her baby face looks and John Connor... every single Terminator movie at the very least has a competent John Connor (looking at you Terminator 3), you understand why people would follow him. A good John Connor is tough, inspiring and charismatic. This John Connor? Terminator 2 John Connor would do a better job at inspiring his soldiers than this one.""But hey, how about Arnold Schwarzenegger? He's back as the Terminator! How's he?"" Arnold has the easiest performance in the movie. His character description is to act 'robotic' and let's be honest, Arnold's never really been the best actor so he does the job well. In this movie he plays the same role he had in Terminator 2, a Terminator with humanity. If this is the same then why did he do a much better job in that movie?So neither the acting nor the story is helping this movie but what about the action? That's what Terminator is all about right? Human on robot and robot on robot action! The first 2 Terminator films' action sequences remain memorable to this day. Does this movie add any new ones?Of course you already know the answer: a big no. The action in this movie is monotonous and unimaginative. It's not shot in any creative or cool ways either, there's nothing slick or cool about the action scenes in this movie. This might be attributed to the film's PG-13 rating or the director's inexperience (his only other 'action' movie was the mediocre Thor: The Dark World.)But with a one hundred and fifty five million dollar budget the movie at the very least hast to have top notch special effects. When it comes to Terminator Salvation at the very least you could say that the special effects looked outstanding and that was mostly due to Stan Winston's incredible animatronics. But there's no sign of any practical effects here. All animatronics have been cut out and been replaced with CGI-clean robots. I guess the effects get the job done but they look painfully iffy in many scenes. Namely a scene where two helicopters engage in a dogfight and any scene featuring T-800s. Compare the T-800s at the beginning of Terminator 2 and compare them to the ones in this movie. There's no contest.Overall, Terminator Genisys is a chore to watch and actually painful in some scenes. The acting is terrible, plot is unintelligible, the action doesn't even stand out and the whole thing feels nothing like Terminator. My advice to this failing franchise? Cut Arnold out, stop revolving the series around the Connors and Reese, return to practical effects, no more time travel and make a movie entirely about the future war (think 2040, not 2018.) And please for God's sake give us an R-Rating!My grade for Terminator Genisys is an F",Terminator Genisys
651,pnguin-22162,"Your an Idiot if you were confused by the ""Ball of Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey Stuff""",9,5 July 2015,"***Possible Spoilers*** After watching T-Genisys, I really don't understand why so many critics and user reviewers had so much trouble keeping track and understanding the premise of the alternate time-line and time travel...The nice thing about the movie is that it basically explained it all within the confines of the dialog (obviously not well enough for the critics and users with IQs below a cricket)...The fact that James Cameron gave his blessing to the script and ultimately the movie, means he had his hands all over it from the shadows. It was a shame that The T-X did not make a cameo like the T-1000 does, but then again, I think Cameron would also like to remove that Chapter from Canon (Watch closely in the Hospital; even though he doesn't reprise his role as the T-1000, Robert Patrick has a brief cameo when the Terminator and Guardian fight).The movie never loses its steady pace... basically taking place in a total time-frame of a few days (even though they do jump from 1984 to 2017), although you do try to figure out how the T-3000 manages to get from one place to another so quickly.As for Characters: Arnold has perfected the role he created 30+ years ago. The awkwardness he marries into a character that is built (now) to protect; being able to show that it can learn ""humanity"", even if it does still have trouble smiling without looking like a serial killer.Emilia Clarke actually plays the role of Sarah Connor very well... she takes on the new toughness with great bravado, all the while still encompassing a nervous and scared woman that is forced into a destiny she obviously didn't want.Jai Courtney... although he will never equal the perfect performance by Michael Bien... well, actually Jai, all he ever is, is window dressing... he does his best with the development he is given; basically the ever-skeptical and naive one.J.K. Simmons...a great role for him, but I think if they would have made his story line the new origin of the role Earl Boen made famous as Dr. Silberman it would have made the movie that much better... giving that character a bit of a redemption from his ever skeptical stance in T-1 through T-3.Now for the controversial part... Jason Clarke as John Connor. Critics are praising his portrayal...I however feel he is the worse of the 5, and that's saying a lot considering one of the JCs only had like 30 seconds of airtime. There just wasn't any life to his character, so very 1-dimensional, from the moment he appears in 2017 (***Spoiler***), you know he's a ""bad guy"". Even before that moment, he's just not a very likable character, he doesn't act like a ""savior"" of human-kind... more a conceited douche-bag with a god-complex.Overall, the is a very entertaining and well paced movie, you don't get overly bogged down with development or back stories... its all in just the right doses to help move the bigger picture along.Lastly, Matt Smith, in what ultimately becomes a very brief appearance for him, but sets him up for the entire new trilogy, does an okay job with what was given to him.I hope I didn't give away too much... highly entertaining and you won't feel like you wasted two hours of your life like a lot of movies nowadays.",Terminator Genisys

Compared to today movies, Terminator 5 had the soul of a real movie like the 1st and 2nd one. The rolls had the right actors. Emilia Clarke played very well. And the best of them was Arnold Schwarzenegger. He let us in his role , so we feel very strong emotions for the Terminator in the movie. The greatest comeback ever! Also it was a great Idea, too jump above the timeline and to show the every 90s kid imagination dream of the timemashine.

653,giacomolamura,Worth a shot to me,7,15 July 2020,"It all depends on which angle you decide to look this movie at. Let me explain: the Terminator franchise has a troubled story regarding timelines. Much like the X-Men one, it played with the order of events so much it became almost impossible for fans to understand it through. So if you're an old school Terminator fan you're probably gonna hate this since it pretty much revisits the first two movies and also changes the course of events ignoring Terminator 2 plot.
Instead if you're approaching the franchise without being so puristic or even having never watched the other movies I guarantee you're gonna like this. It's a nice film after all. It has good directing, great cgi and visual effects and above all a great cast led by main actors Emilia Clarke and Jason Clarke and of course the unmissable Arnold Schwarzenegger as the most fun Terminator Hollywood ever gifted us.",Terminator Genisys
654,stoneage22,Nothing innovative,3,20 July 2015,"Three stars is all I can give this. Some may think it's not fair to compare a movie to others or generalize. However, I've seen plenty of action movies before and this one is not going to stick out. It was a very by the numbers action flick, with most scenes being little more than a setup for the next action sequence. There is nothing here I haven't seen before. Even in the time travel scenes where we've seen one set of events take place and someone comes back and disrupts or puts a different twist on the events, is nothing we haven't seen in 'Timecop' or 'Star Trek: Generations' or a dozen other films.Also, the previous 'Terminator' films have always had something new or even stunning that made them stand out. The original had these two slender, average seeming people running from this machine that's almost like an unstoppable force. No matter how many times you shot him, outnumbered him with cops, or nailed him in an explosion, he just kept coming. It was ground breaking. The second one, 'Judgement Day', showed us a Sarah Connor that was no longer a victim, but a fighter. And it gave us special effects that at the time, were new and almost mind blowing. The last one, 'Rise of the Machines' had Kristanna Loken who was a knock-out. The addition of Catherine Bruester also added a new dimension to the story. And the ending of 'Rise of the Machines', after thinking that maybe the horror of Judgement Day had been avoided after the events of the second movie, seeing the ICBMs taking off and sailing into the sky was just stunning. 'Terminator Genisys' is just a run of the mill action film. I saw nothing here that I haven't seen elsewhere. The acting is adequate, nothing more. Also, lip service is paid in the script, about Sarah Connor not being able to run her own life. Her future and her ""obligation"" to give birth to John Connor and raise this great military leader are things mankind will require of her and she has no chance to live her own life. Emilia Clarke's acting does nothing to convey this misery that she feels. She is a good action star, but we see nothing else from her.And finally, speaking of seeing nothing else from her, why is Emilia Clarke afraid to get undressed? Where did they dig up this prude anyway? She just doesn't seem to fit in with the edginess of a real Terminator movie. Linda Hamilton had no problem being nude for a love scene with Michael Biehn. Kristanna Loken certainly isn't ashamed to flaunt her good looks. This movie should have been rate R, like all the others. That's the genre it dwells in. Terminator movies are for people who can handle brutal, hard hitting action with violent machines and desperate survivors. A PG-13 rating doesn't belong in this ""arena"" any more than an NC-17 rating belongs on a Disney film.",Terminator Genisys
655,Wombat_x1,"Good moments, bad moments. All in all an OK movie. (Spoilers!!!)",6,3 July 2015,"I have mixed feelings about the movie. On the one hand, there were great scenes. Revisiting the scenes from T1 was great, real authentic looking, although the punks could have been cast better. The thing that is missing for me, is that there was no fear factor at all. For me the plot of the movie is an unstoppable killing machine with one thing on it's chip, killing the target, yet every time they have the chance, nothing happens. In this movie, evil John Connor is next to Sarah 4 or 5 times, and he does nothing. So you have killing machines that don't kill, which takes away from the movie for me. For example: T1 was thrilling, because the terminator keeps coming at Sarah, and kills everything along the way to get to her. Having said that: the acting was not bad at all, and the cgi wasn't horrible. I enjoyed the movie, but as I said, it just doesn't give me the feeling that Sarah is ever in any real danger, which is a shame. One more thing I should note, is that Skynet is really losing the plot. They built this killer new terminator, that again gets thwarted by an old T-800...",Terminator Genisys
656,vvhlmzlz,simply boring,3,31 July 2017,"There's a reason why T2 can be watched over and over again decade after decade: it is such a testament to 80's-styled action movies that the atmosphere alone that the movie has made it a classic. That whole movie is like an ice-cold beer in a can that you down all in one shot... and it's still the same closed, cold, pressurized can even after that that magically ""refreshes"" and re-seals itself. And what happens here? Nothing new, except perhaps a heavy bet on partial slapstick comedy ""filler"" on in-between scenes where Arnold's age (as an actor and human being) is made fun of with one-lines like ""old, not obsolete!"" Oh that's right, let's make a movie that is about the Terminator(s) supposedly, but in reality is about giving Arnold a ""retirement cheque"" role. Seriously?Perhaps movies and actors can be generally all jammed into one specific category that seems to be one of the mainstays of modern cinematography: re-hashes, re-boots and re-appearances of actors in roles that they for one reason or another (age most often than any other reason) do not really fit in, but go for it anyway for the big bucks.I had a girlfriend that possessed a wonderful and edgy sense of humor, she had a saying about older women who are past their prime: ""don't they understand that their time is over?"" This applies to a lot of things and/or people. A lot of actors... and directors... simply can't admit their time is way past. Hint, hint, Governator.",Terminator Genisys
657,MrAlanChristoph,*** Contains spoiler *** Interesting but not promising,3,16 November 2017,"It was great to see Arnold Schwarzenegger again but the story with John Connor was a bit over the top and ridiculous. If you're a fan of Terminator then do watch it but be surprised. I never thought in a million years that John Connor would actually turn out to be an enemy and a terminator himself. The character of John Connor was absolutely terrible. And since when did John started liking Skynet?Another part that ruined the film for me was Sarah having a ""father daughter"" relationship with a T-800 terminator.

Anyone giving it a grade below 8 is doing so out of an emotional attachment to the first two movies since the rest of them until now have been sub par. There is tons of action, plenty of laughs, and a good plot setting up an intended trilogy.The acting is very good, those hating on Emelia Clarke's version of Sarah Connor need to accept its a different time-line and thus a different personality. Arnold is fantastic for comic relief and they did a great job of not letting his age effect action sequences.I saw it with 5 people and all of us were confused by the poor reviews we had heard prior to seeing it after seeing it, we all liked it a lot.",Terminator Genisys
662,rosebudfr,Climbing down from giants' shoulders,4,17 August 2015,"The first 45 minutes or so of TERMINATOR: GENISYS are actually fun to watch, which may come as the biggest surprise in the film given the sheer mediocrity of the previous two installments in the franchise (which means the latter has been stagnating for the past 25 years!). The lead character goes back in time to find that the past has been subtly altered, as everything he - and we - thought we knew about the storyline has to be revised. That's the film's great (if, ironically enough, not that original) idea: the time travel conceit at the heart of the series being used to remake and reboot (if not rejuvenate) a franchise that had gone stale with time (à la STAR TREK, another Paramount release). Not that original anymore and smelling slightly of desperation, but potentially fun. And fun it is at first. The segment of the film set in 1984 is highly enjoyable, as we are not explained right away what the heck is going on and are reduced to conjecture as to possible causes, time paradoxes, diverging timelines and alternate futures (two apocalypses set in different years), while the action barely lets on. There is real mystery (what the heck happened to Connor before the time jump? Why and how has everything changed? What are the flashbacks we keep seeing? Can we really trust ""Pop's""?). Everything that was great about the first two films is present and mashed together so quickly and relentlessly that you wish you had time to pause and think about it (although, truth be told, when you do have time to think about it it doesn't make any real sense).Alas, quantity does not really make up for quality, and the remaking/revising idea means the film sets itself up for comparison with similar scenes and characters from the previous two films (the other two have been conveniently discarded into some space/time anomaly, never to be heard from again, one of the filmmakers' best decisions). This means you can't avoid noticing for example how Emilia Clarke's Sarah Connor is nowhere as intense and rough as Linda Hamilton's, or how Jai Courtney's brawny, emotionally flat Kyle Reese lacks the fragility and emotion Michael Biehn had infused his own Reese back in 1984. Or how their romance feels forced here, with our clueless heroes never addressing the fact that they don't actually need to give birth to John Connor anymore given the new situation. And you can't help but notice how the new T-1000 is a pale alternate version of Robert Patrick's 1991 version - the new one is as thickheaded and bumbling as the old one was relentless and terrifying - a real killing machine, just like Schwarz in the first installment, albeit in his own striking way. Our hero even has time to find new clothes and shoes while the dim-witted baddie gets more and more confused and still unable to dispatch our hero even when he finds out where he hides - the old one would never have missed his brains. That this scene is used as a poor excuse to lamely advertise Nike sneakers is quite revealing - not only is the film careening dangerously close to parody world, but the filmmakers are also as clueless as their cyborgs and relying unimaginatively on a clever script - which cannot last for long, as the film at some point has to climb down from the giants' shoulders and be able to stand on its own feet. It fails abjectly to do so. The burn out materializes very soon afterward. Once our heroes time travel again, this time to the near future, and the new villain reveals himself, the main questions have been answered, the intriguing mystery of the start has been lifted, and the film has to settle for rehashed action scenes and chases - directed without the flair of a James Cameron but with lots of CGIs - heaped upon one another (on a bridge! In a building! In the air! In another building!) and mere resolution. This in turn gives way for a horrible, mind-numbing, endless last act where the dull antagonist spews out tired lines about the greatness of machines, the perversity of human beings, bla bla. It's also when everything has, of course, to blow up, because really that's all there remains to do - when in a creative dead end, just blow stuff up. The worst might be the Easter egg scene during the closing credits, which implies that future installments are in the offing (which might in their turn explain some major plot points left dangling here). The TERMINATOR franchise is no STAR TREK folks, and there is *no* way you can stretch out indefinitely a story about the end of the world and come up with endless new variations on the same basic story simply because time travel offers intriguing story possibilities. What time travel doesn't give you is creativity, new ideas, as GENISYS so well demonstrates, or a universe big enough to produce new narratives. You could always try sending our heroes back to the American Revolution, make Aaron Burr a cyborg and Alexander Hamilton John Connor's great-great-great-grandfather... but somehow, I'm not quite sure that would work out fine. Just give it up already. Thankfully, the evil box-office algorythmic machines seem to have spoken, and the future looks set... for now.",Terminator Genisys
663,gitrdonex4,Not Great but Good,6,5 July 2015,"For starters I love the Terminator movies, even parts of Salvation. I did like a good chunk of this movie but certain things kind of set me off. For starters, Jai Courtney. This guy has to stop acting now. Kyle Reese was a somewhat Vietnam veteran but for Judgement Day. He was thin, had scars, and was always on his guard. Jai Courtney is a muscular,monotone, extra serious character and sleepy character, and therefore is the opposite of Kyle. He plays the same character in every movie is was horribly miscast. Emilia Clarke was a decent Sarah Connor. However there were parts that seemed she didn't seem to be playing Sarah well. Finally, the promotion. Whoever spoiled 3/4 of the movie needs to be fired!!! Jon Connor is the villain and not only the villain but a Terminator?! C'mon. **They clearly wanted to start a new trilogy when Kyle and Sarah time traveled to 2017 on the highway. Plus, what was Arnold doing all those years while waiting for them? Arnold did an awesome job as usually, but I wish they could have worked in his normal biker-glasses look somewhere. The one scene the touched me was when Arnold sacrificed himself and right before being destroyed shed a tear. So, Jai Courtney should never act after this, possibly find a new Sarah, and create a stronger plot without focusing on the amount of random action.",Terminator Genisys

But you know what? this movie really surprised me!!!... it was fun, entertained, fresh from the very beginning. It has some humour scenes that made me remember the John McClane from the 80s and a completely new history where John Connor is no longer last hope from humanity, but from Skynet!.If you liked T2, you should see this one.

667,fairdraconica,This film re-writes the original thing and turns it into a stupid joke!,1,5 July 2016,"Worst Terminator ever and a mockery of everything that was credible before! The very first Terminator had that awesome tragic vibe and hopelessness about it, when Kyle Reese (the scarred, traumatised, thin man, grown up starving and surviving, as best as he could, in the world destroyed by war) was the only hope of the oblivious humanity, and even he didn't believe in himself, but made his ultimate sacrifice through pain, suffering and death, nonetheless. He and Sarah were just two regular human beings, children of their worlds.I can't believe they just re-wrote all of that, turning it all into... this. Now it's just a ridiculous, plastic action film with no soul.The actors are cardboards. The way they act has no resemblance to the original characters. Jai Courtney is NOT Kyle and Emilia Clarke is, most definitely, NOT Sarah. It doesn't look like they even tried. If I was that bad at my job, I would've been sacked.

That alone is reason to boycott it.There are only three Terminator viewings that are worth seeing and that is of course T1, T2 and the great TSCC which carried on the real time line.Do yourself and your Terminator brothers and sisters a favor and skip this horrific attempt to cash in on the Terminator franchise.",Terminator Genisys
669,Jaiseserrat,"No, what have they done?!",4,2 December 2016,"**SPOILER**Being a huge fan of the Terminator franchise, I was intrigued to see what the newest instalment had in store. Controversial it might be, I really enjoyed the last terminator film 'Salvation' and thought maybe this film would continue in the same gritty direction set by its predecessor.I was wrong. The only thing this terminator sequel continues it's the somewhat campy and over emotional TV feeling that was set in Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines, and lost that connection with realism that the iconic first two instalments set up. The stakes only feel high in about two minutes of the film, whilst the rest feels pretty watery.The casting was strange. Note that the acting isn't bad (if not hammy at times given the script work, since when were all characters so involved with their emotions? Where's Sarah and Kyle's backbone??) Given that this Terminator film was supposed to be sending well known characters back to when they were first introduced in 1984, the actors playing kyle reese and Sarah Connor look very little like their first incarnation, which only adds to the feeling of giving the Terminator franchise a ""sexy gloss"".The story was equally convoluted. One of the reasons I love this franchise so much is that it's story is the heart of the business; judgement day happens, mankind is nearly extinct, Terminator is send back to kill sarah Connor (and later Kyle reese). This film's story line is really clutching at straws to sell tickets, putting forward theories and plot devises that I'm sure made James Cameron say ""...what?""On the whole, worth a watch to see where the newest instalment and I'm sure its subsequent new sequels are headed, but don't expect much. Arnold is great of course, but even then acknowledging that the Terminator is getting old (and that part about the 'upgrade' is ridiculous by the way) to excuse the actors ageing doesn't save it. Effects are good, but in my eyes, the Terminator should've saved his 'I'll be back' for a stronger, grittier, more grounded production.",Terminator Genisys
670,npham54-754-347632,Better than I hoped but definitely not as good as T2,8,12 July 2015,"OK, just like the top reviewer for this movie, T2 was and most likely is one of my most favorite movies of all time. It truly is epic and is one of James Cameron's greatest achievement of his still ongoing career. My review is based strongly against my love for T2 and the expectations I have for this franchise. Sadly though, Cameron did not direct this movie and I believe it took it a hit to how great it could've been considering that I gave this movie an 8 out of 10 review. So let's start off with the review for Terminator Genisys.Overall this movie was pretty well filmed. The cinematography was good and the locations are well chosen. They all play very nicely with the first two Terminator films. You can tell that this director has a different eye compared to Cameron's if you even watched the first two. I actually wished this movie had the same feeling as Terminator & T2 but it doesn't. It has more of a film that's trying real hard to be a huge blockbuster. I believe James Cameron didn't care too much about that and was more raw in the emotions he wanted to to feel about the film, story, and it's characters. The story line for this movie was surprisingly pretty good with some corny lines thrown in for some comic relief. I like that they are able to, for the most part, able to keep everything smooth and not leaving you wondering like, ""WTH does this have to do with anything?"". I do wish that there were more ""action"" scenes between the terminators like in T2. Soundtrack wise, this film had took some of the sound of T2 and tried to incorporate it without basically ripping it off completely. But I didn't feel it helped me feel so emotional as it did in T2. It didn't help reel you into the scenes as much as I would've liked. A good soundtrack is the invisible factor that helps bring everything together and helps bring those emotions the director is intending for you to feel with each different scene. They fell a little short for this film.Overall this is a good continuation to the franchise and if you enjoyed the Terminator films, you'll enjoy this one too. Personally if I had to rank each of all the Terminator films it would go something like this:Terminator - 9 out of 10, Terminator 2 - Perfect 10 out of 10 Terminator 3 - 6 out of 10 (was really bummed out how crappy this was), Terminator Salvation - 8 out of 10, Terminator Genisys - 8 out of 10",Terminator Genisys

Only thing I did not like that it was little more childish than 1st 2 films, but again it was +12... on conclusion, it is worthy film and best after 1st 2 ones, so... go and see it!

Some movies have been able to pull it off, this one does not. T:G creates more logical paradoxes in 2.5hrs than the entire series of Star Trek: Voyager, and that's really saying something. Casting: I've got an idea! Why not cast a beloved time-travel icon like Matt Smith, and then have him appear on screen for 5 minutes? Then cast two roided-up nobodies and have them grunt there way through thousands of lines of insulting mono-syllabic action-movie dialog for two freaking hours? Also, JK Simmons is there for some reason! At least he has the decency to look embarrassed during most of his scenes. ANY SORT OF LOGIC: Helicopters do not work like that. At multiple points during this movie the creators prove they have an extremely tenuous grasp on how even basic gravity works. You want to prevent an apocalypse and you have a time machine? Show up TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE THE APOCALYPSE. Great idea. You somehow prevented the apocalypse anyway and you want to be sure it doesn't happen again? I don't know, maybe don't hump Kyle Reese again and make another John Connor? I could go on for hours.

674,hailhydra86,Terminator Genisys is yet another sequel that fails to live up to the first two movies,5,2 July 2015,"The central thrust of the scattered, clanging and unwieldy ""Terminator Genisys"" is that the Cloud will destroy us all.Now, they do not exactly call it the Cloud, as they do in last year's ""Sex Tape."" But maybe that straining Cameron Diaz-Jason Segel comedy was onto something when it warned us that uploading information and then sync hing all our electronic devices to each other might be a dangerous thing after all.But for better and for worse, this is Schwarzenegger's show. His performance, and his character's evolution, are the reasons ""Terminator Genisys"" turns unfortunately jokey and self-referential, to the point that it borders on parody. Schwarzenegger's one-liners helped define the franchise in its early years. They were a reflection of this flesh-covered machine's awkward, heavily accented attempts at assimilating with humans, and they provided much-needed comic relief. Here, when he says ""I'll be back,"" it's more likely to produce groans than grins. Schwarzenegger has turned into your elderly uncle, dancing like a goof ball at your wedding after a couple glasses of champagne. He knows he's being silly, and he knows that you know, and that alone is supposed to be good for a laugh. But it's not. It's just sad.

The story also focuses too much on over explaining stuff that are not important, but leaving audiences asking questions that they will never get the answer to. The only thing they did well but manage to screw up at the end was Terminator Arnold. At first was a lovable character, but over time his humour and actions had just became a cliché that follows Hollywood wherever it goes.

It was a great experience and i really enjoyed watching it. dude i got to meet Arnold Schwarzenegger after the showing and dude it was really cool. so the movie is about the terminator future where the machines have taken over the planet and humanity is led by john conner to ""take back their world"" as he puts it. so eventually he decides that they need to prevent the onslaught (dude big vocab) before it ever happens and to stop a bad terminator from killing his mother, Sarah Connor. so its sort of like x-men days of future past BUT DUDE NO WAIT so kyle Reese offers to go back in time and do just that. But when he gets there he finds out that Sarah Connor has a good terminator who helps her and they team up to change the future. the tag line of the movie is ""The Rules have been reset"", so its pretty much copying ""Transformers: age of extinction"" from last summer, where its tag line was ""The rules have changed"". we all know how well that turned out. the movie is pretty cool. it has some nice action scenes and Arnold Schwarzenegger kicks some butt. the chemistry between Reese and Sarah Connor is pretty mmmmmm interesting while the movie does sort of feel like a rehash of the first two, and thats not good. I was hoping they'd take a more original way with it but instead they chose to have all these scenes similar to ones from the first two movies, like the 1984 bad terminator being beaten up by the good terminator. some of the action is also really crazy. and dude by crazy i don't mean Adam sandler. i mean ""wow dude that didn't make any sense"". like where the bus flips over on the bridge, it looked a little cool, but dude its not that cool. because the scene looked pretty unrealistic. the bus flips over and Sarah and Reese area hanging off the side of the golden gate bridge, but luckily for them DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN - the good terminator saves them. oh and the good terminator also says ""ill be back"" and jumps out of a helicopter, then crashes into another one much further below. DUUUDE that reminds me of a time where i was in a helicopter but dude it was being shot at so dude i had to JUMP out of the helicopter and i landed in a tree five hundred feet below but dude i was okay cause I'm strong and so dude i like SLIDE down the side of the tree cause dude its falling down because someone was cutting it down at that moment and i land at the bottom and go off in the woods after reluctantly accepting a chocolate bar from the guy cutting it down. but dude anyway ...Like i said, the action is a bit ehhhhh. it felt as ridiculous as the rock in san Andreas at times. and dude Vin diesel is bald. the supporting cast is well dude okay. jk Simmons has a neat role, while byung hun lee had a decent character. but they just didn't really pop out that much from the rest of the cast. and dude i needed them to pop from it. dude there's not much else for me to say. the movie's decent, with some good action scenes and characters but at times it just felt really dumb. so i sort of didn't like it but i really kind of did so ill give it a ten out of ten. dude its better than terminator salvation with batman and terminator 3 which was ewww. so dude go watch it and dude enjoy dude its coolTERMINATOR: GENISYS",Terminator Genisys

I just didn't expect the ride I was going to be on when I finally saw it a few days ago.I'd seen all of the trailers for ""Terminator Genisys"" (even the James Cameron interview one) and I still wasn't convinced that it was going to be a good film... Until about the five minute mark.Nothing about this film was over-the-top for the Terminator world, even the surprise twist that occurred half-way through it. Matt Smith (the 11th Doctor from the ""Doctor Who"" franchise and Patrick Bateman from the Broadway play ""American Psycho"") was outstanding in his role and so was (very surprisingly!) Arnold, in his return role as the T-800 Terminator.The alternate time line subplot of the film totally fits the world of the film, especially since they didn't make it too drenched in science wording. Even when Terminator explained it, it gave a rough estimation of what could've happened, almost as if the film wanted the audience to ponder what happened (in anticipation of future films?).The film did a great job in not only paying homage to the first film, but expanding upon it in a way that leaves it new and fresh. Even though there was humor, it was still a smart science-fiction film, something that has been lacking in American cinema since the first ""The Matrix"" film and the release of ""Hunger Games.""I didn't think that I'd be pulled out of a hiatus of reviewing for a new Terminator film, but here it is! And, as Jim Cameron said it best, ""If you like the first Terminator, you'll love this one!""",Terminator Genisys
678,guitarplayinglegend,The best Terminator movie this generation could ask for.,9,11 July 2015,Arnie is still the man. It was awesome to me that they used technology to put a younger version of himself on screen and also acknowledged that he has aged by allowing him to be his natural self as he looks today. Not to say he looks bad because the guy still has it but this was the perfect way to make a 50+ Arnold more believable. He has changed a few things about his character but I was really impressed by his acting. Arnold has changed with the times and so has the Terminator franchise. Only this is the type of Terminator that isn't going to disappoint serious fans of the first two Terminator movies. He was still a bad ass but he was also very funny in this movie and had me laughing a lot. I think everybody in the movie nailed their roles. You couldn't have asked for a better cast other than T1000 who wasn't really that important to the movie. You could have had Arnold fight a younger version of himself and I would have been sold on that alone. I am not complaining because we can never go back in time to re paint the same picture. I noticed not one person said this Terminator ruined the franchise for them because it was done so well that you can't say that. I know everyone has high expectations seeing a classic be reintroduced to Hollywood but just like everything in life you don't go back and do it over again you evolve with the times. Terminator Genisys has made me learn to love these movies again. It's more than a one time watch. Im buying this on bluray when it comes out because all classics that get revamped need this type of attention to detail. Total Recall and Predators obviously missed the point. It got a lot of people angry. Not this time. Great movie. I love you Arnold. Do another Terminator movie.,Terminator Genisys
679,Cez_Aslak,Terminator is Terminated,4,4 September 2015,"OK... Considering that it isn't Cameron who did this I added an extra star for the people trying to follow.... Considering that Taylor did this... as I am not a fan of Thor II (though I do love ""dark world"" as a concept, the film actually su... well I'll let you make your own opinion....) I do take away a star... so I guess I rest truly at 4.... Arnold rocks... he will always rock. Sarah Connor is a rock star (as always) but in this film she has taken too many ""Harry Potter"" tips, and whines just a bit to much for me... (but that is a personal opinion, and if you agree the fault is the writer not the actress, nor even the director (though I am willing to throw the producers (as I am sure there are many...) under the bus)...) Kyle... well... he just had no idea what was going to hit him from the beginning (from a writer, actor AND director point of view I think...) and it kinda shows in the editing.... All n all... if you are not expecting an AWESOME movie but just a laid back ""terminator sequel thing-a-ma-jiggy..."" you have hit the nail on it's head...you won't be disappointed... HOWEVER If you actually waited for an awesome sequel to Terminator... don't watch this... you will be.",Terminator Genisys

However when he gets into the time machine, John Connor gets assaulted and then...Basically the whole past is changed. The date of Judgement Day is now different, basically throwing the second movie in the trashcan. Surprise, this is not the only thing that changes.Jonh Connor now is the one that protects Skynet and the one that MADE Genisys. You know, John Connor, the guy that they protected since movie 1 because he was the chosen one to stop Skynet. I did read that a 6th movie will come, so if the old and good John Connor returns then this could be a good movie, but if this is the end of the Terminator franchise then it is the worst, most disappointing end to end to a series of such good movies.",Terminator Genisys

682,tripolis29,"Makes ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" Look Great...",4,15 July 2015,"I rarely review, but this was beyond me, as I felt I had both to warn people before watching this, and give a chance to myself to let off some steam by writing a few words... It was bad... It was really bad...in several levels.1. The script was completely disrespectful to the franchise. Well, sometimes you just need to leave a few things as they are, out of respect only. But no... they had to mess with the timeline, so much that even ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" TV show looks less complicated, in terms of story. As you may have noticed from the voice-over during the film, even the screenwriters were looking for answers, along with us, the viewers...2. The cast was a complete fail. Sarah Connor... Kyle Reese... John Connor... wow, I mean 3 out of 3 miscast? What are the odds for such a fail? Especially Jai Courntey and Jason Clarke... I like them as actors, but the roles were absolutely not for them! I only leave Arnie out of this. He was decent and funny, and in my opinion, the only character that kept my interest going during the movie.3. Cinematography... well, it was as if I was watching a TV series, rather than a big budget movie...the lights, the shadows, everything was wrong... and I've seen TV shows with far better cinematography than this, let alone movies...As a huge fan of Terminator Salvation, where the story was loyal to the Terminator mythos and the cast was amazing, I felt betrayed. And I never understood why Terminator Salvation had so many enemies... amazing story, great cast, future war on screen for the first time... Why didn't hey continue the franchise from there? So many stories can be told having the future war as background. I wanted to see Kyle Reese grow up and become the faithful right hand of John Connor, I wanted to watch the latter climbing the hierarchy of the leadership of the human Resistance, I wanted to see how Skynet and Connor sent the Terminator and Kyle respectively back to 1984, but remaining faithful to the well known timeline, I wanted to see how they later sent T-1000 and Arnie back to 1994, and then what really happened to John Connor and how the T-X and the second reprogrammed Terminator were sent back to 2003... These are what the fans wanted to see. Not a reboot. I could live with a slightly changed timeline after Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines... but I can't live with a whole new timeline.What I loved about Terminator was that it played with the inevitability of fate and events. This is what made it different from the Back to the Future movies. Well... this was a Back to the Future Part II film...not a Terminator film...",Terminator Genisys
683,diegosolamito,"Total mess, I couldn't watch till the end",4,5 July 2021,"I love terminator 1 and 2, and I decided to give this one a try. Let's begin for the good part (and it's very tiny) I love to see Arnold in the film, and it brings a lot of good memories of the original terminators, but other than that, a total flaw. The same formula on the fights and robots are used to make a terrible confusing plot about time travel. You just don't care anymore for Sarah or John, because it doesn't matter anymore in which timeline they are nowI stopped watching after 40 minutes because it doesn't worth it, unfortunately it's a terrible movie.",Terminator Genisys

685,jamman76,Why all the hate from the critics? I loved this movie!,9,6 July 2015,"This is a spoiler-free review. I have no idea why the critics hate this movie. They must have never seen T1 and T2. T2 is my favorite movie of all time. With this movie, you have to pretty much pretend that T3 and Salvation were never made. Even though I like both of those films, I can disregard them for this film's time-line to make sense. Needless to say, I have been really excited that Arnie was returning to the franchise. He didn't disappoint, nor did the rest of the cast. I expected to hate Jai Courtney as Reese in this movie after reading other reviews. I found him to be a likable character. A viewer needs to watch the movie and understand what Reese's mindset would be like. If you were him, would you trust a Terminator? I also saw this on an IMAX 3D screen and it was spectacular. That is the way to see it. The 3D imagery, the special effects, and the sound design were top-notch. If I had the time, I would consider seeing this movie again in IMAX 3D (and I haven't seen a movie twice in the theater since The Dark Knight). It's a shame that this movie bombed in the US this past weekend. However, it was #1 worldwide so there is hope for a sequel. Worldwide box office has kept the Expendables franchise going and I feel that this movie is better than all three of those (and I am a fan of those films). I really hope they release this on 3D Blu-ray. That is the format that I want to see it on at home.",Terminator Genisys
686,bonekeep,"Isn't bad, just not very good...",5,4 July 2015,"Mad Max restored my faith in franchise reboots. Thankfully I saw that before Terminator Genisys. This film isn't bad, just not very good. Poorly written and poorly acted, I just didn't find much compelling about the film. I'm not what you'd call a big Terminator fan, but like most found the first and second installments to be great. Number 3 sucked... and they made a fourth? I hear that Terminator fans are liking this film, I imagine in large part because of they're comparing to the suckage that was Terminator Salvation (2009). I watched it on IMAX at the TCL Chinese Theater in Los Angeles because that was the feature on screen during my visit, but probably wouldn't have chosen to see this flick otherwise. Nonetheless, I had hoped for a solid big screen experience and did come away from it a fair bit disappointed. Arnold was decent in his portrayal of an aging Terminator and loyal companion to Sarah Connor played by Emilia Clarke. I felt Emilia Clarke was miscast and did a poor job in a central roll. She is no Linda Hamilton for sure. Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese was terrible and Jason Clarke as John Connor was about as good as he could be with the week writing given to him. Overall the production value was good, though seemingly not much new from visuals created by James Cameron 15 years ago in Terminator 2: Judgement Day. I would say if you're a huge Terminator fan, go watch this... especially if you want to get the bad taste of Salvation out of your mouth. If you want to see the splendor of IMAX on one of the largest IMAX screens in the world (3rd largest), along with the amazing movie history that Graumans contains, go watch this. Otherwise, save your money.",Terminator Genisys
687,almooreuk,Complete waste of time!!!!,1,3 July 2015,"This movie is just a complete mess. The plot is all over the place and you never once believe that any of the characters are in any danger. There is no tension or excitement and the fights scenes are very short and unoriginal. All the villain terminators are killed very easily, which again makes the movie lack any tension. The cast all do their best but are let down by a rubbish script. I appreciate the fact that they tried to do something different with this movie but it just didn't work. The magic of James Cameron's original movies is well and truly gone. Arnie is clearly only back for the paycheck.",Terminator Genisys

I consider what i've watched totally NOT a sequal because it deleted all what we know & loved about a great sci-fi franchise & i really don't know why do they made it in the first place!! If it's for the Money so hell with it & don't disrespect the audience like this.,Terminator Genisys
690,rac060254,Why can't they keep the story straight?,4,29 May 2018,"OK, this is just entertainment and not 'earth shattering', but this newest 'Terminator' just makes a mess of what had been established in the previous 4 movies. The famous speech in the first movie did not include the famous 'no fate but what we make' part, that was retrofitted into the 2nd movie. In the 2nd movie the extinction of the human race in 1997 was averted, then in the 3rd movie it ended up happening anyway in 2003. The 4th movie held onto all of this backstory and had John Connor married to Kate and looking for (and eventually finding) a teenager Kyle Reese to make sure he can send him back in time to be his father. This movie just ignores all of this, even before the timeline shift that occurs when Sky Net convert John Connor. The movie starts out with the extinction of the human race happening in 1997 which was averted in the 2nd movie, Kyle Reese is found by John Connor when he is still a young boy, the famous speech that was given to Kyle Reese now includes the famous 'no fate' line. All this before any timeline shifts.They people who made this movie could have paid better attention and had all of this recounted according to the way it went in the original 4 movies, it would not have adversely effected the rest of the movie at all. So, why did they botch this stuff up so badly?",Terminator Genisys
691,christopoulospan,Not horror any more,6,16 July 2015,"i don't want to say many things...Genisys was not so bad like terminator 3 but its really strange why they don't follow the same line with the first terminator,a more horror/sci fi rather than action/scifi movie with moments of comedy....I don't know what producers have in theyr mind....There are a lot of action scenes but there is a lack of atmosphere like was onthe first 2 movies. By the way they trying to reboot the series and thats agood thing..Arnold plays as should be and Emilia Clarke was a nice choise but would prefer to add Lena Headey for the main role (Sarah Connor). So horror path is the right way for that film so i m really hoping for it..",Terminator Genisys
692,anthonymaw,Just awful....,2,9 July 2015,"Wasted $12 watching it on Tuesday on 3D AVX. In short this movie is awful. The characters are unconvincing and the re-worked story line is hard to believe, even more so for anyone who has seen the original Terminator and T2 with the original characters. Great computer effects typical of American Hollywood these days but it cannot compensate for a movie that is too long and too weird plot where they send another terminator to kill the first terminator that was sent back, or something stupid like that. The movie is seriously lacking in originality. Even stranger was old Terminator meeting young Terminator, both played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Like all the Sarah Connor Chronicles the Terminator theme has been taken too far now. It's dead Jim.",Terminator Genisys

The twist to the new plot was very creative.The trouble is that where 1 & 2 gave you the thrills because it was a bit grimy and there was no escaping the Terminator this doesn't. There are simply too many (repetitive) jokes all the time taking away the tension.The helicopter chase, wow, that was suck fake over-the-top-Michael- Bayesque crap. Please, just go to the bathroom when this starts.Then there's the dust/nanobot material that the enemy is made of. Please Hollywood, we've seen in it in the last Transformers and it ruined the movie. In this same thing, doesn't completely ruin it, but the enemy is no longer a cyborg.Then the nr. 1 issue. The trailers and movie posters...... the biggest spoiler is in the movie poster.

694,Alexcailliau,Not even average,4,18 August 2015,"I will make no judgment on image & SFX quality as I've seen this moving from a cam capture. And God, I'm glad I haven't paid to watch this...My first encounter with the Terminator world was when I was 11 and T2 was in theaters. Maybe that's the reason this film had a huge impact on me... But no, still to this day, I enjoy watching it as I enjoy watching the first film. T3 didn't bring much water to the mill, the typical chasing but still, it did let Judgment Day happens and that opened a lot of new doors to carry on further. Still it's nonetheless my least favorite of the Terminator films (Salvation had the merit to take a whole new perspective on the story line).With this Genisys, what do we have? Gobbledygook!!! I wasn't very focused on the film cause it was not that entertaining from the beginning. But then you get caught into time-lines and questions rise... How did the Gardian become the Guardian? After all he was sent back to kill Sarah in 1979 but somehow got reprogrammed? How did the T1000 arrive in 1984? T3000? T5000?Ha come on!! I hate it when you have the feeling the movie writer is sort of having to explain things... Give me a break... I would have gone watch one of those Hobbit film if I wanted to watch such things...So no Terminator Genisys is NOT the so-called ""3rd film in the franchise"" Mr. Cameron... It's just a film that allow Hollywood to reboot this franchise... With probably worse to come. But that said, it's not worth just 1 star...

I personally hate Jason Clarke, but I guess he did ""okay"" on this one. Jai Courtney disappointed me scene after scene - why he was chosen for a huge role? Oh well, the same goes for many actors on this movie, but still I found it to be entertaining. I never expected it to be another T1 or T2, not even T3... But it wasn't one of those movies I just couldn't watch to the end. I even liked more than hated it.I liked seeing the familiar scenes from first Terminators. Only if the actors were the originals as well or even better ones. Arnold delivered and even funny at some parts, but maybe this movie should have used more of him to it's advantage. Animations were done well, you have to watch pretty closely easily tell that it wasn't the original young Arnold. Very impressive, though. More Terminator, please - but with quality casting (+ Arnold, of course - he's still far away from being too old for this). This movie didn't fully deliver what I was waiting for all these years, but I'll watch it again... Maybe. It had potential for so much more!

697,kathindiaka,"Really good. Complex, funny, heartwaring. I don't get the hate.",7,8 July 2015,"This review has no spoilers He said he would be back Okay, the squad as usual got together to watch Terminator Jy nai sies (It's only funny if you understand Afrikaans) Going into this film, the three of us (Muso, Joash and I) were fairly curious about this film, yet cautious. On one hand, it's freaken Terminator! And Arnold is back fully and not some CGI thing off a rack like in Salvation, and the trailers were really good (well, trailer, the first one. I got a heads up about the spoiler in the second one and avoided it like it was a T-1000) However on the other handever since James Cameron made Titanic, the ascending fumes of the movie goers' dollars were apparently converted into a sort of mystical praise that led him to the self-destructive epiphany we were all hoping he would never reachhe is a film God. No more small time movies like True Lies and The Abyss. No, he will only take on his pet projects, and only when the technology is readyso we get 10 year hiatuses between each film (WTF), and what studio would say no? Each film he makes now breaks the all-time box office record.What that led to was the studio looking elsewhere to find a different director for this franchise that must keep ticking towards its own proverbial Judgement Day (my puns are on fleek. Oh God). Let's not beat around the bush, Terminator Rise of the Machines and Salvation were garbage which made everyone believe this franchise will only ever work with Cameron. And then I found out Genisys's director is the guy who brought us none other than Thor the freaken Dark World.So together with the bad reviews this film was getting, our expectations were kinda balanced, but our hopes were a little on the down-side. Turns out we were worried for nothing.As any movie does, and certainly one directed by Alan Taylor (thank God there were no evil Teletubbies), this film has flaws, but we walked away thinking more about its positives than we did about negatives.Despite being the King of the time travel genre, the first two movies weren't nearly as complex as Looper, Back to the Future, Donnie Darko and dare I say the Butterfly Effect. The first one was bordering on horror and the second one a bit fun action thriller. Genisys is the first of the franchise to fully utilise that tool. There are multiple timelines, alternate realities and outcomes are explored as any film about a subject matter this interweaved should be.Some of the dialogue could have been better, some of the exposition should have felt less like a class lesson and more of a discovery, but some of it was necessary.The CGI is impressive, especially at the start. When Arnold shows up as the original T-800, the villain in The Terminator, I thought it was just taken straight from there, and parts of it were, but there was a new sequence that made Arnold look his 35(?) year old self again that was completely believable. And another thing. Genisys pays homage to its ancestors, particularly the first two. There is a scene with the T-1000 that will make you lose your crap if you're Terminator fan. AlsoThis film was funny! It seems besides governing California and fornicating (Californication), Arnold has been working on his thespian skills. Maybe a little too much. Where the T-800 in T2 was funny yet believably mechanical, I thought he had a bit too much personality here to pass off as a killer robot. However it was not enough to take me out of the film.I thought Emilia Clarke was fantastic. After her role as the Mother of Dragons in the popular Game of Thrones, it's clear why she is the only actress right now worthy to ascend the throne of Sarah Connor. While she is not quite a badass as Linda Hamilton, she owns the role and oh my God is this woman breathtakingly beautiful.I thought Jai Courtney was adequate. He is not as rubbish as many are making him out to be and I thought he had several emotional tones that went unappreciated. Can't wait to see him in Suicide Squad.My only real qualm with this film is its villain. I'm not a fan of the way they handled this villain, both in the film and in the marketing department. Seriously, screw whoever greenlit that spoiler poster and trailer, man. The reveal is such a huge moment in the film that you simply cannot fathom why they would choose to show that a month before the film is out.Outside of that, I don't think Jason Clarke was all that great as John Connor. He was decent in Dawn of the Planet of Apes but I guess didn't have much to work with here.That said, I cannot quite understand why people are hating on this film. The last time I enjoyed a good time travel film like this one was Predestination. Doctor Who fans are treated to a nice surprise.Well done Alan Taylor and team.",Terminator Genisys

I like how they pick the people to play the role that are link to T1 & T2. The actors has similar looks. Example the guy in the garbage truck from T1 when the Terminator arrived in LA (1984). He almost looks like the same guy as the original movie. Also, when Kyle put on those classic Nike shoe in the department store just like the T1 scene. It was great!! This movie brought back a lot of memory from T1 & T2. Also, thanks to CGI Arnold looks younger in 1984 scene and looks older in the future year.

I went along more for morbid curiosity, as perhaps people might have done in the 19th century to see the bearded lady or the deformed midget.I can't say this is dreadful, because it isn't. This film is in fact the true epitome of mediocre. Its like it was made for TV. I find myself comparing this movie to the likes of Terminator 2 and all I see are Hollywood dollar signs everywhere. What happened to story telling? It's just gone out the window, along with believable science, physics, character development, suspense, and any kind of moral message or theme.so what about the script and characters? I honestly believe the script for this movie was written in one afternoon by a small group of 9 year old boys who were also playing xbox at the same time.What about the effects of this movie? well, they are as good as any. Actually, this movie is one long CGI showcase for whatever special effects studio was contracted to do all the action scenes. But I don't really go to the cinema and see a movie and then say ""wow, the effects were so good, that I didn't care at all about the story"".and what about the plot? You could easily just write down on paper random phrases like ""travels back in time to 1984"" ""John Conner"" ""Skynet"" ""memetic alloy super robot"" and ""escapes from the explosion unharmed"" jumble them all up and then assemble them in any order, and it would be the exact same movie. Everything is explained away with science fiction buzzwords and deus ex machinas.the music is nothing special. hans zimmer was involved in some way, but I suspect his involvement was mostly to have his name on the credits and get a load of money, and not much else. The classic terminator score is no-where to be seen (or heard).By the end of the 120 minutes I couldn't care less whether skynet destroyed the planet or not. I just wanted to leave the cinema and go do something else.The saddest part of all is that I can foresee a sequel to this, possibly without Schwarzenegger. They have thrown the baby out with the bathwater and just gone along with the ""well, its time travel so we can do anything we like"" justification. Its become like Lost. In the end, nothing made sense and the explanation was always ""well, its because it is the island"".This movie could have been called ""time travelling robots versus the humans"" and it would have been the exact same nonsense.

Onto the actual film.I can go on scene from scene what's wrong -- but why? Quick overview in conclusion (this crap doesn't even deserve a review)---------This film seemed rushed -- ""let's just get this over with"" is what they said. Sloppy, weak, one shots, and all.

The beginning was very catchy though. I was beginning to forget the time machine built by Skynet. But this scene had to be the last scene.I was beginning to get technical about time travel but decided it was best spare you the nonsensical theory underlying it. If you are a Terminator franchise fan, you'd remember the first scenes in the first movie. Well ""things have changed"". Time is no longer linear, or whatever I guess. Old Schwarzenegger (good) fights new Schwarzenegger (bad) in this scene. Didn't recall seen that in the first movie. Maybe it was in the deleted scenes? We'll never know. What we do know though is that whatever we saw in the first movies was definitely built by Skynet to fool its viewers into believing there was never an old Arnold Schwarzenegger hiding behind the bushes in every scene.So, in resumed words, I'll tell you what made me turn off the TV and return the movie. They're in the truck old Schwarzenegger begins to push Sarah to mate with Reese. Sarah then tells the stupid robot (really? after all these years and after having super advanced technology it is still stupid) that it's not that simple, that she has to ""fall in love with"" Reese before mating with him.I really don't know if it was the epic destruction (multi-movie in multiple dimensions) of the franchise with inventing a new type of time travel or the sad and mediocre story line and screenplay that made me want to turn off the TV. What I do know is that, before Arnold Schwarzenegger was someone, there where very smart people working on these stories. This just shows you having lot's of money doesn't make you any smarter, because I for one am sure Schwarzenegger had something to do with creating this. We have an old saying here in Puerto Rico, ""zapatero a su zapato"" (Let the cobbler stick to his last.) Schwarzenegger mustn't have any saying in any movie anymore.",Terminator Genisys
702,emking-75596,"PG13, comedy not good for T5",7,4 July 2015,I have a few problems with T5. #1 The pg13 rating was a big problem for this movie it's a terminator it's only goal is to kill or protect not make leg injuries! If you are a threat then you die or get in the way you die as per T1. That great police station shootout is an excellent example he killed every one that got in his way...perfect. You can put T2 in the same boat the bikers should have been terminated and that scene from the building no fatalities? #2- The comedy was overdone one terminator smile is funny but three is overkill and a terminator making jokes! #3- The T800 should have been destroyed after flying into the chopper blades and when did they start flying. He emerged unscathed? Then to keep allowing him to come back after destroying John was the one thing that really lowered my liking of this movie. T800 should have died not upgraded? #4- I hate to talk bad about Emilia Clarke but she look like she was just going through the motions. No sense of urgency or desire like T2 #5- The score was OK but it never compliment the movie at all. Overall I was not that bad if the above could have been fixed it would have been a lot better 7 out 10.,Terminator Genisys
703,robertyaniz-41545,'Terminator: Genisys' Resets the Franchise's Future,6,21 July 2015,"Terminator: Genisys – which employs time travel as a storytelling device far more than previous entries – has lots of opportunities to delve into the complicated connections between John, Sarah and Kyle. However, though some truly great character stuff crops up, it is ultimately cut down by a mid-film plot twist (yes, the one spoiled in all the marketing materials, for some reason) that never manages to really make come together. The film squeezes so many complicated plot developments into one film that its story ends up spiraling out of control before the credits roll. Still, Terminator: Genisys offers far more inventiveness than its two predecessors and still stands as the best Terminator film in many years.For the full review, visit my site.",Terminator Genisys
704,StephenMalovski,The problem with Genisys,1,2 October 2015,"It is hard to describe how stupid this movie is, but let's use this as an example: in 1984 Sarah Connor has a time machine and wants to use it to travel to 1997 to stop Skynet from getting online at the last minute, instead of maybe spending the 13 years stopping it at her leisure. The big twist in Genisys is that when Kyle Reese comes back to 1984, as we saw in The Terminator, he doesn't find the waitress Sarah Connor but rather a warrior, raised by a good guy T-800. It's not clear why history has changed; this is one of the 'mysteries' this terrible film has left open for the sequels to answer. Anyway that's the big twist, and it's not bad as far as high concept pitches go. ""What if Sarah Connor said 'Come With Me If You Want To Live' to Kyle Reese , i can almost see the studio executives getting excited over this idea. And the opening bit, a recreation of the beginning of The Terminator is almost enjoyable. But it's enjoyable in that way where you hear a bum in an alley shout ""Hey that guy stole my pants!"" and it reminds you of the time that exact same thing happened in a superior movie. The script is the biggest problem with Terminator Genisys - it is stupid and it is riddled with cheap, lazy callbacks to movies that have technically never happened after this reboot - but the casting is the second biggest problem. Jai Courtney is a disaster as Kyle Reese; he's wrong in every way, having none of the weary soldier qualities that Michael Biehn brought to the role. In The Terminator there was a deeply felt love story where Kyle Reese traveled across time for Sarah Connor. Their relationship in Genisys sucks, and it's made worse by the fact that Emilia Clarke is absolutely, one hundred percent terrible as Sarah Connor. This is supposed to be warrior Sarah Connor, as seen in T2, but Clarke can't sell that. Clarke is missing the steel that Linda Hamilton brought to the role.(Heck, Lena Headey was ten times better as Sarah Connor than her Game of Thrones costar) . She's simply unconvincing, and her attempts to be commanding and decisive come across as shrill. The only person doing good work in Genisys is Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's just doing his T2 thing again, but he's at least having fun with it, and that fun comes across. Even when he's doing his dead-eyed Terminator thing Arnie has a thousand times the charisma of Courtney, eclipsing him in every scene they share. Most of the running time of Genisys is either callbacks to the first two films or set pieces inspired by reminding us of those movies. This time there are two helicopters - and they chase each other! And they act like space ships, by the way, doing moves that feel impossible. There's an assault on a hospital, not a police station, but close enough! There's another T-1000 to run away from while pointlessly pumping bullets into its liquid metal body! All of these scenes - many of which involve robots shoving each other around - are boring. But most annoying is that almost all of these scenes also include terrible CGI, from the dismal de-aging on Schwarzenegger to general bad composting and phony looking CGI creations. There's a new kind of Terminator in this film (this is the only thing these sequels change up) Instead of liquid metal this one is made of buzzing nanites and it looks bad. Even the T-1000 effects look somehow worse than the ones from 1991. Genisys is always moving ahead breathlessly, so it's never ponderous, just always stupid and bad in a quick way. The other positive thing is JK Simmons as a cop from 1984 who reappears in 2017 having had his life changed by his interaction with time travelers. He's funny. There's not enough of him, but he injects the only humor that works into the movie. The script for Genisys sags under the weight of its idiocy and lack of internal consistency until it gets to an ending where Sarah and Kyle are continuously menaced by a hologram of Skynet, and they keep shooting out the projectors again and again, so many times in a row that it becomes completely a comedy beat. At the end of the movie, as Pops and the new Terminator float in a CGI battle of meaninglessness, Terminator Genisys simply becomes a parody of itself, as if no one working on this movie could continue to take it seriously. There is an audience that will eat this up - it's fast and there are explosions and endless barrages of gunfire aimed at robots that cannot possibly be hurt by it and there are so many callbacks to the first two films that the average fan-boy could go ""Hey, I understand what they're referencing!"" non-stop for most of the running time. But it's bad, and I think it's objectively bad. More than that, it's a desecration of classic films, overwriting the first two Terminators and replacing them with this garbage, with a movie that doesn't understand time travel but insists on talking about it all the time, a movie that ruins the iconic characters established in 1984. The film ends on a note that feels more appropriate for an episode of a TV cartoon than a Terminator movie",Terminator Genisys

The writers completely change the character demeanor of these two. John Connor is played by Jason Clarke who is a terrible actor to begin with, and before you know it they're just scooping hot turd onto the bread. The script writing feels lazy and not very creative.

The plot line was exciting and understandable (at least, as understandable as time-travel movies can ever be). The actors did great. I had seen all the previous Terminator movies and really only liked the first two. I went into this movie with great trepidation, and figured it would be just some average summer popcorn action flick. But it was so much better than that! This Terminator movie one was right up there with those first two. I don't know what those critics are thinking.

714,amjoeabraham,""" i'll be back"" , not quite!",6,7 October 2015,"Many years ago, when I was not yet in high school, I saw Terminator 2: the judgment day on TV. I didn't know who James Cameron was but had heard of Arnold Schwarzenegger. (Didn't know how to pronounce correctly though.) He and Tom Cruise being the only Hollywood stars, me or my friends knew of till then. Then the movie happened! That was the best action movie I had seen till then. Nearly fifteen years later, it is still one of my favorites.Terminator Genisys is not a bad movie. But as with any franchise movie, it bears the pressure of being compared to its predecessors. Compared to the ones after Judgment day, Genisys fares pretty well. But quite not enough. The best thing is that Arnie is back. As he puts it – old but not obsolete. Better machines/models with upgraded, refined powers have come. But no matter what, how many beatings he take, he will save the day! Writers have taken a quantum leap of logic to explain his aged look, relating it to his 'living tissue over metal endoskeleton' bearing the brunt of time! I wonder how the 'living tissue' is being fed. Terminator is the perfect role for Armies' acting skills. He plays a machine. So absolutely no need to emote!Judgment day was based on a complex premise. Machines vs man in the future, time travel etc etc. But basically it remains a very very simple plot. A good guy protects a weaker (read humans) kid and his mother, from a much powerful bad guy. The biggest problem with Genisys is that it's anything but simple. And what is even worse is that there is nothing much new about the villains, provided no major change is possible for Armies' character. So there is time travel, shape shifting terminators, altered time lines, cryptic warnings, nano machine hybrids, all thrown in to make it more complicated and a bit confusing. CGI is great. But then nowadays every other big budget action movie has great CGI.Terminator is protecting Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) and she calls him 'Pops'! Terminator in turn goes Chappie and draws pictures of them together and keeps photos and all. Desperate attempts to tug that emotional cord with the audience. Emilia is great but it's hard not to see her as the Khaleesi of The Game of Thrones and we kind of expect a dragon to pop in when she gets into a situation, and feel that would have been much more fun!Genisys is fast paced, action packed with reasonably good writing. A good entertainer. But its place in my heart would only be till the next big action movie hit the screens.",Terminator Genisys
715,ragingteapot,Not quite T2 but totally better then everything that came after it...,8,5 August 2015,"Not to paraphrase too much but this is one of those movies where you have to move forward and not look back. Don't judge this movie based on T1 or T2, it's connected to those movies but it stands on it's own. The last 5 years has seen a number of franchises come back to life, some are as good as the first such as Star Trek from JJ, whilst others raise the bar on it's immediate predecessors, such as Jurassic World. This movie is more in the vein of Jurassic World in that respect.One of my many stolen quotes is ""it could of been worse"", or ""we've been through worse"", and that is certainly true of Terminator. Check your expectations at the door and you won't be disappointed.Arnie is back and he's actually really fun to watch. The relationship between the characters is done well, you actually feel a connection between Sarah and her metal friend. The special effects are outstanding and the movie never lingers too long on a particular subject or reference to previous movies. Some say it's complicated, have they seen Interstellar? Alternate time lines can be a little hard to get your head around, just accept what you're presented with in this movie and don't worry about how it got that way. You'll enjoy it a lot more.Bottom line, movie has heart, great new cast and Arnie is back as himself from the first movies. As it's own work it's actually a movie worth seeing on the big screen, and how many movies can say that in the past 6 months. It's like the nuclear winter of good movies this year.I love how the critics hate it but the audience largely love it or approve. It just proves my point that these critics are so wrapped up in their own self importance they forget we all have opinions and actually watching a movie and forming one is something most people are capable of. Do they actually get paid for writing this stuff down?Sometimes you just wanna see stuff get blown up and bad guys get wasted. Not every movie needs to promote self reflection and tackle moral dilemmas and whilst T:G might linger on the perimeter of ethical themes fortunately it doesn't get consumed by them.If you liked T1 and T2, you'll like this, simples.",Terminator Genisys

The humour and anecdotes stirred a chuckle in me while the action and FX just entertained. Speaking of FX, it was like watching a James Cameron original with today's technology injected into the formula along with a seamless digital recreation of the young Arnie T800's face.

Maybe they will clear some things up in the sequels but I don't care. They have taken Terminator as far as they should and now it's all about making more money.The acting is nothing special except in the case of Kyle Reese. Jai Courtney did a total Prometheus here and gave us a character nobody could possibly like. Considering he is supposed to be the hero of the film he goes out of his way to annoy just about everyone.I remember when Terminator was a serious film franchise.

Okay, so the science doesn't live up to the ""reality"" of ""viable"" time travel - whatever that is from other reviews. So what. This was a fun movie, with a mostly enjoyable cast - except for Jason Clarke as John Connor, the ""hero/savior of mankind."" Whoever cast him was either off their rocker or owed him a huge favor because he is sooooo unlikable as the character, making John Connor unbearable and unsympathetic. I don't know anyone who'd follow this John Connor into a bar, much less a firefight. Otherwise, this movie went from fun to action packed, and with good special effects - not too over the top. And I can't remember laughing while watching a movie this much in a long time... and the laughs weren't at the movie, they were because of the humor in the movie.

720,rbellach,Squandered potential,4,1 July 2015,"I would call myself a casual fan of this franchise. I have seen all four previous films, but I am unfamiliar with the 'extended universe' of the TV show, comic books, etc.That said, when I had a chance to see the new movie on the night of June 30, the first time it was available in wide release in the US, I was excited.I had already read some of the early reviews, and most were negative. I tried to temper my expectations and view the movie with an open mind...The first half of the film is a pretty interesting re-imagining of the original Terminator movie, with some winks to T2. Undeniably the best part of this film.The halfway point brings a twist. Without getting too spoiler-y...one of our heroes becomes a villain (if you've seen the trailers, you've seen this moment). The explanation why this happened felt pretty weak to me. This still could have been an interesting plot point, but the filmmakers abandon any emotional effects of this betrayal and give us a generic baddie who could have been anyone.The second half of the movie becomes just another Terminator sequel, with the new villain chasing the good guys and Arnold's T-800 acting as the protector. A fight sequence set in a hospital is pretty good, but the action becomes increasingly repetitive after that. Overall, this part felt about the same as T3 in terms of quality - average on action, lousy on everything else.The real bummer for me, and what ultimately leaves an average movie leaning towards a lousy one, was the ending. It really put a sour note on everything that came before. Skynet plans to launch via a cloud computing operating system (topical!) that reminded me of Samuel L. Jackson's villain's schemes in the much sillier (and more enjoyable) Kingsman: The Secret Service. In attempting to take down this evil OS, called 'Genisys,' our heroes run into a holographic projection that embodies the consciousness of Skynet. Or something. I'm not sure. This was a fairly minor moment, but it was *so* dumb. This was a mistake also made in Terminator Salvation (which featured Helena Bonham Carter as the personification of Skynet), but Terminator Genisys found a way to make it even stupider. This was the absolute low point of the movie, and the remaining action finale was frankly one of the most bland in the film...Overall a disappointment, made worse by the potential I saw in some of these plot ideas. They just didn't follow though with any of that potential. It's like a cover band playing a set. They do one or two cool covers. You think, this is pretty decent. And then they're like, ""Hey, this is one of our original songs, hope you like it""... ugh. The ""cover band"" part of this movie is good. The rest not so much.In 5 years, I'm sure I will enjoy this on basic cable. You won't miss that much waiting until then.",Terminator Genisys

Because what i saw was a funny, well acted and executed action movie set in Terminator universe. I guess critics were giving it such low scores because it wasn't iconic, inventive or important like first two movies were. But lets be honest, there was not a chance that Genisys would be as good as first two movies. I was expecting a disaster, another stupid cash grab with Terminator name on it. When i walked out of the theater, u was shocked, i was asking myself why did i like the movie so much when everyone was spitting on it. But it really is good. Jokes are funny and served at right time and references on first two movies are awesome! Characters are likable and well acted (Emilia Clarke is amazing and so is Arnie). There are really a lot of good aspects of this movie, but the movie is definitely not perfect. The antagonist is not very good, plot twist is predictable (and spoiled in the trailer!! Definitely don't watch the trailer), and the ending is too cheesy and not-satisfying (at least not as the rest of the movie). So, as you see, i loved the movie and every action movie lover should see it. As much as i liked the movie, i think this should be end of the Terminator franchise, I'm just not hyped for a sequel and it would probably be another disaster like Rise of the machines was.

There's not an ounce of passion anywhere in this film, it's solely designed to make money from anyone suckered into revisiting a once beloved franchise. If you doubt me watch the first movie (made 30 years ago, for a fraction of what this mess cost), or the second- hell, even the third, directly before watching this.

I had no real interest in seeing this movie, and if this was what I were to base my opinion of the series as a whole on, I would have no interest in seeing the others. Part way through the movie I decided that it was worthless to try and figure out the plot, so I just let my mind stop trying to decipher all the time traveling and just watch the action. The action was fun, but there was no particular scene that would stick in anyone's head longer than a day after seeing the movie. All in all, the performances were very flat. Jai Courtney was a boring protagonist and I didn't really care what happened to him. I'd heard great things about Emilia Clarke from Game of Thrones but, while she was fine, she just did not seem like a good fit for the part. I liked Jason Clarke in Zero Dark Thirty, but in this I could see why many people brushed aside his performances as boring. Arnold Schwarzenegger was the only really enjoyable character. JK Simmons was wasted and his character added nothing to the movie. The plot was convoluted, while at the same time feeling recycled and hasty.

I had to sit in that theater knowing exactly what was going to be the major twist in the movie, and its really disappointing that these companies put obvious spoilers in the trailers in order to use that as a selling point for their film. Don't worry I won't spoil it in here on the off chance that you have not viewed the trailer. The film is a lot better than the critics would have you believe. It does its job in providing entertaining action with cool looking visuals. The action isn't amazing and neither is the cgi but its passable. A lot of people criticize the casting of jai Courtney as Kyle Reese, but I think he did fine, a little more emotion would've been nice but it wasn't monotone or anything. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the resin to see this movie. He takes it from slightly below average to borderline good. His humorous delivery is fantastic, he pretty much is the only reason I consider this movie decent.

Rather because of the story twist.The first half of the film is very much true to the original two films but then it goes completely off course, in a way that I liked, as I previously said. Once we find out that John Connor is the real threat (a daring move by the writers) things only get more ""messed"" up. Again in a good way.Emilia Clarke is the highlight of the movie, at least for me. Rather then using her beauty to sell the film the director (Alan Taylor) relied on her acting chops and presence. The rest of the cast including Arnold do just fine. Making for a fun and exciting time at the movies.I'm doubtful this film will get a sequel but it deserves one, very much so.If you like humor AND Terminator this film is for you. If you take things like movies to seriously you won't enjoy it.",Terminator Genisys
728,donatello-28906,"Brilliant start, good twist. Let down by key actors",7,9 August 2015,"There are many tributes to the previous movies that are a warm welcome. The future scenes are tight and not overdone. When we travel back in time, we witness some great surprises - but everything stumbles when we meet Sarah Connor - she just isn't the original and doesn't quite pull it off. This ""Gi Jane"" clone tries way too hard to be far too assertive (the Usual ""I'm a woman"" tripe that's getting long in the tooth. She almost refuses to be rescued by a man - that was either terrible writing or terrible acting. How idiotic can you get). Maybe she should have paid attention to Linda Hamilton's performance - strong, but avoided the chest thumping ""I'm a woman"" tripe. Linda's Sarah just got on with things. Kyle compounds this situation by playing the equally awkward counter to Sarah, their relationship dysfunctional and annoying to watch. It was almost as if he wasn't sure how to play opposite an over the top Gi Jane - and who can blame him. Arnie did a great job - vulnerable and fallible. He was fantastic - not what I expected. Jason Clarke as John Connor was great in the first 30 minutes only. Again, his behavior becomes dysfunctional and unnatural. The special effects were fantastic. You really couldn't fault them if you tried. It's a shame that 3 of the 4 main actors didn't gel. Gi Jane was the weakest of the bunch. Definitely worth watching. If a sequel is made, drop the female Rambo cliché, fix the relationships and keep the great sfx up.",Terminator Genisys

This is poor, especially regarding to the great tradition that the ""Terminator"" series has. Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing a great job here, but he is almost the only one. Especially Emilia Clarke is not convincing. She is just not the right actress for the role, way too sweet. The dialogues and quarrels between her and babyface Jai Courtney are striving and laboured, not authentic. The movie also has some lenghts, it doesn't hold tension. Settings and effects are not on highest level, too. I am sorry to say, but this is definitely not the best ""Terminator"" we have seen.",Terminator Genisys

732,frost-64768,As Good as T2!,10,17 March 2019,"I love all the movies, but I found this film manages to recapture the emotional depth of the first two movies that was missing from the last two. I wanted a sequel at some point to feature additional time travelers including John Connor himself back during the original film. Genisys played up on similar ideas, so I thoroughly enjoyed this film.How does this fit in with previous movies? Kyle Reese appears to be from the original future as he was in the first movie. Arnold and the T-1000, I theorize that instead of being sent to the 90's for T2, they were sent to the 70's after Sarah Connor. T3&4 are ignored, but a fin idea. What if the embodiment of Skynet was from that timeline or another and kept jumping back until he reached the original future, because... reasons? He assimilates John Connor into the T-3000 and sends the T-1000 after Sarah Connor in the 70's. Next, John Connor T-3000 jumps back to 2015 in a new timeline to create another version of Skynet. Someone sends Pops back, and then the movie plays out. That's how I see it anyway.Jay Courtney's acting could have shown more emotion, but I really enjoyed this movie. I love how for once, we got a happy ending with all of our heroes alive. There's a tease that Skynet survived, naturally. Given T6 will ignore this movie, I'm happy with how it ended.People are too hard on movies today. It's entertainment. If it's bad, you don't have to hate it. Just watch something else. Breaking down the movie to explore why it failed, that's always fun though. Anyway...",Terminator Genisys
733,gbnf,So many questions,6,7 July 2015,"I heard a lot of negative reviews for this movie, so I tempered my expectations. After watching it I was genuinely confused. Who sent Arnold back in time in 1973? How did Arnold and Sarah create a time machine in 1984 so easily when in 2017 skynet was not able to do so with unlimited resources? If skynet Jon Connor wanted to kill Kyle & Sarah why didn't he do so immediately at the hospital when he 1st met them? If skynet Jon Connor didn't want to kill his parents why not keep them in custody until skynet heads to the cloud &/or make sure to fortify the Genysis location? Why didn't the T-1000 kill Kyle in 1984 when 1st encountering him rather than answering Kyle's question?

Nobody can match the grit and sizzle of Linda Hamilton in T2. Just Sayin.' This is The Terminator universe from T1, T2, and T3. You don't come to this movie not knowing some or all of that. Time travel is a core part of this reality. If you can't suspend disbelief on time travel, then none of the Terminator movies will work for you and never will. Starting with T2, it got more interesting, because protagonists and antagonists time-travel across the same time lines before that installment's hilarity ensues.Terminator Genesys is a happy reunion with that universe... with crashes and chases and lots and lots of stunts.

Thankfully the majority of the movie succeeds with creative writing, enjoyable action, and solid acting, especially from Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was definitely the best thing about the movie and does what he does best (look cool in an action movie while unleashing great one-liners left and right).

Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to his signature role as the T800 at various ages, the CGI rendering of him as the ""original"" model is fantastic. The use of cues from various parts of the saga pleased me, as did the recognition of them as they happened. Arnold gets to utter his now infamous one liners and appears to be enjoying himself Jai Courtney finally fits as the action hero they've been trying to make him, Emilia Clarke makes a fine Sarah Connor and Jason Clarke is as dependable as ever, JK Simmons once again proves his fine skills. Hans Zimmers score is excellent too, riffing off Brad Fidels epic drumbeats and adding his own inimitable style. The action set pieces are stunning, the story multi-layered and requiring some thought, overall it succeeds in what it sets out to be, awesome,spectacular, blockbuster movie with everything I've hoped for and more besides.

Genisys is a great tip of the hat to the first 2 films.It has elements of all the previous films whilst carving it's own reputation. There are flaws, a lot of flaws actually but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment. I came out of the screen and had a half an hour argument with my partner about time travel and why we each had different feelings about the way the story ran. It is polarising! Arnie is great. The Terminator has more human traits than ever and his relationship with Sarah Connor is a nice throwback to the way John Connor felt about him in Terminator 2. Emilia Clarke does a great job, as does Jai Courtney although I'm still not sold on him as yet. It did throw me off a little to see John McClane's son fighting side by side with Sarah Connor! (Disclaimer, this film is definitely better than A Good Day to Die Hard.) In short, go and see this film. Don't expect scientific accuracy but do appreciate the effort.",Terminator Genisys
742,jbel14,Marketing campaign was this movie's biggest flaw,8,5 July 2015,"After seeing it this afternoon, I really have to wonder how jaded a bad marketing campaign could make people's reactions to a movie. Terminator: Genisys apparently takes the cake, because there wasn't any part of the movie playing out that looked or sounded worse than what the marketing campaign made it out to be. The movie had my heart pounding on at least three separate occasions, which is more than I can say about the last couple installments. Story-telling-wise it wasn't in the same league as the first two, but definitely better than T3 (a shallow experience that rode on the coat tails of 2 almost scene for scene - http://www.magazinetimepass.com/terminator-2-and-terminator-3- similarities.html), and Salvation (Apparently Christian Bale thought he was still Batman, script was literally and figuratively deserted, only original idea was Worthington's character, and no Arnold).So much of the criticism of this movie seems overwrought with bandwagon knee jerk reactions based on early press, which were also victims of horrible marketing. Look back to the original comments the original trailer had everyone making about the bus flipping from apparently hitting a car (way off http://www.cinemablend.com/new/So-Who-Flips-School-Bus- Terminator-Genisys-72053.html) and being cgi (also way off http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jscW05NSg7M), and everything since then being equally off-base and spoilerific. Then there are the actual casting choices, which I myself really questioned-particularly Jai and Emilia-who ended up having more chemistry than anyone in T3 or Salvation once I checked my preconceived notions at the door. Most of the people in our audience also lol'd at various comic relief points, especially from Arnold and J.K. Simmons. No lines of dialog came off as cheesy as quite a few moments in T3; even the whole ""Pops"" thing was grossly blown out of proportion within the film's context. The T-1000 played a minor part, but did so convincingly. Jason Clarke was more enjoyable to watch as an adult John Connor than Christian Bale, and played the role with much broader range and feeling. Sorry Batman. The CGI was also another point of contention early on, and the final product was sufficient at worst, impressive at best. T-1000's effects appeared much better than originally shown, as did Arnold's younger self and John Connor's ""upgrade"" was interestingly menacing. In all I think this movie deserves to do better than either T3 or Salvation, so hopefully it does and I'm certainly looking forward to a special edition Blu-ray release.",Terminator Genisys

744,abyboom-1,Once again Hollywood shows us how difficult it is to make a good Terminator movie,5,26 June 2015,"The Terminator movies (sans TS - I am not even sure if it's part of the cannon) are basically chase films with the element of time travel thrown in to create unique Sci-fi protagonists and antagonists.The first two films were smart enough to understand the limitations of time travel as a viable ""science"" and hence kept the focus on it's characters, surroundings and action (note : I do not say special effects). T3 tried to explain away the canonical inconsistencies (eg. it's existence) with some quantum mumbo-jumbo, but again it was kept at a bare minimum (almost hinted), showing a self awareness from the writers that even if you need to write stupid stuff for exposition, it's not necessary to go full blown Shyamalan on things. Of course, T3 is nowhere clinical in it's nightmarish quality of T1 or matured enough for the majesty of T2, but at least it looked like the people behind the movie were trying sincerely.TG jumps into the bandwagon of using time travel as a rebooting device, which currently is the go-to template for many franchises (XMEN, Star Trek). But it makes the cardinal sin of driving ALL plot elements through this device multiple times. Hence, you are left with bizarre recitation of quantum fields, alternate time-lines, nexuses in time points associated with important events, all wrapped in ""delivery under 60 seconds"" by Arnold's ""Pops"" (Dear me, Arnold and Quantum Theory in the same sentence). Mix into this Internet/Cloud/AI, phase matter, time displacement with a dash of 12 Monkeys - all stamped with Hollywood's grasp of ""science"", and you start wondering why was the Kitchen Sink left out. The movie really doesn't have a plot line as such. It's feels more like a re-edited version of separate episodes stitched into a movie, to throw a glimpse into the life of these characters over a period of 2?3?4? days. Each day/episode starts with a shocking (read : spoiled by trailer) reveal, followed by ""scientific"" explanations, followed by CGI explosions and chase. The less said about the ending the better - the ""emotional moment"" where the survivors think they will ""live happily ever after"" has concrete foundations in ""Marvel Studio Science"" - the current rage of Hollywood. The feeling of clunky and disjointed adventures for our saviors of humankind is more akin to Stargate tag line (""Saving the universe one day at a time"") rather than a complete coherent movie, even if it be a summer popcorn/potboiler/studio crash grab event.Now Arnold can play a terminator without getting out of bed in the morning, and sometimes it feels exactly like that - there are many instances where he was just disinterested in the proceedings. He also has the onerous task of providing dumb plot expositions every time the ""plot"" takes a hard right/left. One is left to wonder that with this much encyclopedic knowledge on the universe and decades of readiness, why he never leaned how to fist fight against his fellow 800s.The movie might also be called ""The death of Kyle Reese as we came to love him"", as Jai Courtney is probably the biggest miscast for the role (bigger than Matthew Goode as Ozymandius in Watchmen) . Gone are Michael Bhein's nuance portrayal of a psychologically scarred and physically fatigued soldier doomed to a tragic fate as he tries to fight impossible odds to save the women he loves. Instead, we have a clean shaved and chiseled smart-ass who spends the entire movie being a HUGE ass**** to Arnold (with multiple stare contests between him and Arnold ALA Twilight) , and who is looking to ""score"" with Emilia Clarke's Sarah (not bad in the role). Even though he says he will die for her more than once, the delivery is just not reliable. A big element of Reese's character in T1 was his virginity, something the audiences gulped down because of Bhein's performance. Courtney's Reese comes across someone who LOVES his soldier job way too much and has tamed many members of the opposite sex. There is ZERO chemistry between the two, and the inherent romance (which in my opinion was quite smart in Terminator) becomes another obligatory check box for the movie to tick. I wont even go into the ""humor"" between Arnold and Emilia on this topic (borrowed from T3) that the movie tries to choke it audiences with multiple times.Mostly everything in the action scenes are CGI, but in majority they are not distracting, except when they CGI-ed Arnold all over. There are multiple chase sequences of varied length and complexities - not bad, but nothing we haven't seen before in other movies.Twice we hear Fidel's epic Drumbeats from the Terminator theme, but that's it. Rest of the soundtrack is so off, that these two instances come more like a reminder of the good times we had decades ago, while TG gleefully murders everything that was great about T1 and T2 (come to think of it, T3 is a masterpiece compared to this). The final nail in the coffin - ""Bad Boys"" playing in the background as characters get their mugshots (don't ask).",Terminator Genisys

746,andrewgoro,Liked the story,6,27 November 2015,"First I did not expect much from this movie after PG-13 announcement, but after seeing it I did enjoy the story for this movie as a continuation of T2. But I did not like how the story was made into film. Here's the breakdown: 1. PG-13 - obviously this is very disappointing seeing PG-13 Terminator movie with Arnold in it. Although the movie had some blood, it was not enough obviously. 2. Arnold as a terminator. Terminator is a machine, it does not think, it does not doubt, it does not hesitate. However they continued the idea of T3 of Arnold being more like a human. 3. Directing is terrible compared to James Cameron Terminators; in fact directing was like any other movie today. There is no dramatic appearances, no close-up action, no concentration particularly on Terminator. The movie is made very bright and shiny unlike original dark and scary Terminators. 4. CGI was beyond terrible. T1-T3 had so much more realistic Terminators first of all with majority of action scenes being real. Here you have CGI terminators with poor CGI action. And John Connor becoming another type of Avenger character did not belong in Terminator movie. They had huge budget for the movie yet they failed to shoot worthy action. 5. Actors. Although many criticize actors, I personally liked all actors except Sarah Connor. 6. Obviously many questions come up with this time travel. If they stopped Skynet, how come Arnold terminator and Kyle Reese did not just vanish? Also why John Connor was so obsessed with Arnold terminator? He could have done his job successfully without all those unnecessary chasing. And could have destroyed Arnold easily with his ability and power. 7. Happy Ending. Arnold gets miraculously upgraded during explosion of Cyberdyne. Why? In general since this movie will not have sequel, the movie kinda loses its purpose and leaves many unanswered questions behind. I give 6 to this movie only because I liked the story and idea. I am sure James Cameron would have made epic out of this idea.",Terminator Genisys
747,RogueKnite,"Terminator Genisys ""Rant-View:"" Or How Adolescence Destroyed a Franchise",8,31 March 2016,"To say I'm a huge fan of the Terminator Franchise would be an understatement. I've been enthralled with this series and its characters since my first exposure to the property in October 2000 on T2:3D at Universal Orlando. I have saved my movie stubs for both Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (the 3rd film) and Terminator Salvation (the 4th film). I have found myself defending these maligned sequels more times than you would think. There are delightfully fun moments in these films that are pure imagination candy to viewers who are not expecting the heir to the Terminator 2: Judgement Day throne. So when I walked into Terminator Genisys this afternoon, I was positively ""high"" on the concept of having another film to add to the Terminator mythos. Especially one that has the master returning to his throne, Arnold Schwarzenegger was back! Boy was I in for a shock.As I mentioned earlier, I am an incredible Terminator fan, so being objective will be difficult. The film is a narrative mess. As someone who has been a ""student"" of the Terminator mythology, I consider myself an expert on all things Terminator (what a shameful title). While watching TG, I was scratching my head (both figuratively & literally) countless times trying to discover what the characters were trying to do. Eventually, I came to the conclusion the film is trying to emulate T2: JD and when it is not doing that its ""spinning its wheels."" Most of the plot is lifted directly from T2: JD. The only plot point that is somewhat original is the villain. I will not disclose that, but if you have seen one morsel of marketing material from TG, then you already know the plot twist. Other than that, it is essentially a remake with new actors playing characters that are indelibly etched into our minds by those who portrayed them in the first two films. Our new leads, Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney, are perfectly serviceable, yet cannot match the intensity of their predecessors. Although these two are not the film's biggest problem it does not help. In addition, the film's largest fault, is its greatest strength: Arnold Schwarzenegger.Schwarzenegger is phenomenal! Each time his Terminator appeared on screen, I grinned from ear-to-ear. Schwarzenegger's giving this his all and doing everything you would want from him reprising his most iconic role. Yet he is sidelined to 3rd wheel by Clarke's Sarah Connor & Courtney's Kyle Reese. These two are our leads, which is shocking, considering Schwarzenegger was the star of T2 and T3, and his absence from Terminator Salvation is blamed partially on that film's lukewarm reception. This circles back to the film's main issue, its script. For a film that is catering to the Terminator fans, it spends an egregious amount of time harping on plot points we are already aware of as Terminator fans. For the record, I could not fathom seeing this movie as a non-Terminator fan. Its plot is convoluted for no particular reason, especially when you consider this film's driving point is to renew the series, in order to entice new viewers. In my screening, I saw 2 13-year old boys and girls with mom, who was clearly the fan. Unless they were ""die-hards"" like their mother, I cannot imagine them appreciating anything in the film besides, ""Wow, explosions! Can't get that anywhere else this summer.""You are probably figuring I dislike this movie. Absolutely not! I enjoyed Terminator Genisys, albeit I was a little disappointed when I walked out. Yet that is not entirely the film's fault. Being a Terminator fan for almost 15 years, I had envisioned a film in my head that could never come to fruition. As it was solely my vision as to how the story-line should progress. There is quite a lot to appreciate in this film if you are a Terminator fan. As I mentioned, all the Schwarzenegger scenes are stellar, even if they are few and far in between. The highlight scene of Terminator Genisys, a helicopter chase through downtown San Francisco (ironically spoiled in the marketing), contains all the grandiosity it warrants. There is even more Terminator ""eye-candy"" for die-hards of the franchise that necessitates a theater viewing. Specifically within the first ~30 minutes of the film, where our heroes have to dispatch two terminators. This scene is easily a highlight not only for the film, but for the franchise as a whole.At the end of the day, Terminator Genisys's largest hurdle is its own fan-base. Most Terminator fans saw The Terminator or T2: JD while in adolescence. Seeing any movie at this age puts it on a pedestal few films, seen in adulthood, could ever reach. Most reviews of Terminator Genisys chide it for not being awful, but also not being a worthy follow up to T2: JD. If you looked at the majority of film critics, you would notice most fall within the aforementioned demographic of ""they were introduced to this series between ages 7-15."" I can only hope the film-bloggers and critics see the folly in their mindset for this franchise. Once you exit the prism of childhood affinity, you will appreciate much more in life, especially Terminator Genisys!",Terminator Genisys
748,kevinmoran-430-929163,As a fan of the Terminator Franchise.,5,2 July 2015,"I am a Terminator fan. I enjoy the Terminator films, television series, and comic book library. I have been awaiting a new film installment to the franchise for some time. I have also enjoyed Arnold Schwarzenegger's contribution to the film series and believe that since he is able, he should contribute to the films.I also want to disclose that I enjoy watching films in their intended format, that may be 3D, 4K, IMAX, etc. When I viewed Terminator Genisys, it was in a 3D IMAX setting at a Cinemark Theater in Tulsa, Oklahoma. From what I read about the film before going to see it, I could not find any information on whether or not Terminator Genisys was filmed using any IMAX cameras. I also read that the film was not shot using 3D technology but later converted to 3D from the 2D format. I feel as though I noticed subtle differences; although, I am not an expert.I was able to notice the movie screen deficiencies while the movie's image was projected. This was not a problem for me, it was most noticeable when the image was a light, bright color, like white or blue hues. Certain 3D images were blurred or not focused as well, most noticeable were the opening credits, the movie image itself seemed untarnished. Also, it felt as though my eyes needed some time for adjustment, my biggest issue would have been my depth perception. I felt the 3D conversion was not entirely accurate in that area.To save more criticism about the 3D IMAX experience, I feel that the studio and production company would have been better off spending the money to make it legit from the get go instead of the later conversion. Large format film and 3D cameras should be the standard by now.The movie itself felt a bit raw. Maybe this ""raw"" feeling had to do with the Director, maybe it was chopped and cut to fit a story line. Moving on, Terminator Genisys stars the well known characters from the franchise, with a twist, the leads from past installments shared the screen with others now giving the screen a crowded field at times. Some players did not share the weight to convince me they deserved such a strong presence in the film, while other seemed to deserve more. This dynamic changed during the movie as well. I think the focus should have been on one character, instead it was two characters, then two different characters. Then it became about four characters, even more at times. The direction was weak or it wasn't well thought out.The story had some very strong points, it also had loose ends. The Science Fiction aspect of the film was somewhat believable, could have been more polished. The machine that is the Terminator has been a work in progress since the second film. I felt there was no need to challenge Cameron's initial creations, they were terrifying. This film, like Terminator 3 and Terminator Salvation are looking to amaze audiences with the Terminator instead of captivate or haunt them. The actors and actresses executed the script quite well considering what was given to them. I think they drove the movie toward collapse at times but ultimately salvaged it in the end. There were different dynamics going on for these characters and for a person not familiar with the franchise, this would have seemed confusing. I am very familiar and some aspects of character development seemed unhinged to outright ridiculous.If Terminator Salvation was not a success, I can't imagine this movie will be either. As a fan, I will add it to my collection and watch it again, I will continue to dissect the movie as well. I won't hope for a better Terminator film, I will wait for it though. Maybe a Ridley Scott type can take a crack at directing something fresh for the fans. It doesn't have to follow the same characters to be a Terminator film. I think the Terminator needs to hunt and kill some new threats in the future to be successful. Aside from the already cemented storyline of the Terminator franchise,blood, flesh, and metal is what the Terminator is about. Explosions, car chases and police involvement could have been better executed both tactically and in good taste.It wasn't a waste of money for me but I expected more. I am somewhat disappointed though because this was not a stand alone film, it was a film in a series. Arnold Schwarzenegger could have taken a back seat also to set the stage for a stronger actor to lead the franchise. The story of the Terminator films has been very much recycled, bring it to the next level or don't bring it.",Terminator Genisys

Hope there will be another Terminator!All this critics here are just out of logicSomeone sad there is too much of action: in ""Terminator"" movie... is too much action.. wow, did you hear yourself?Someone wrote, its not logical and complained about time travel machine that its can be real, yea and terminator itself is a very real.or there are people compare this with T2!

750,richard_heys-757-149700,A mediocre reboot/sequel,5,7 August 2016,"After viewing this film twice I decided to put down a review of it highlighting what I enjoyed and what I didn't enjoy in this movie, this is a movie worth seeing twice, not from a you miss moments in it but from the point of view of trying to watch it for what it is the second time around.So to begin with, this is the fifth terminator film to be released which is in a way a sequel at the same time a reboot. To start with lets look at the cast, Arnold returns as a T-800 which can be seen as a good thing as he made that role his own, his role in this was duel, one side of it was basically a lot of fan service, him attempting to smile, him pulling out the shotgun on the other terminator, his famous line ""Ill be back"" and the humour relating to a unemotional being. So it was alright, if not just much the same. His second part of his role is as mentor and father figure, he helps Sarah Conner become who she is at a much younger age, he also helps move the plot along explaining certain things that are happening in the movie. I have no real complaints about him as a character. Kyle Reese in this one is played by Jai Courtney, now, this in both viewings I had a problem with, and I personally couldn't quite understand it until recently, his character is very different from Kyle Reese from Terminator 1 and even Salvation, in T1 he is a dysfunctional solider who seems to suffer from PTSD, his look even is ragged and lean and he his facial expressions tell a lot about him as a person, that he has suffered a lot, even Anton portraying him in Salvation was a good choice, he was ragged and lean, a little naive but that to me was okay for that film. Now we have the third portrayal of Kyle here and we get a guy who looks like a goddamn body builder, who is always confused and most of his lines are done for comedy relief. His character is the further thing from what Kyle was like before. Sarah is played by someone from Game of Thrones (I have never seen it before but thats what people tell me). Lets take a look at Linda Hamiltons character from both T1 and T2, and the character arc in both, she is an individual who starts off as a typical 80s horror cliché the woman who is very good at surviving if not much else, in terminator 2 she becomes a major azzkicker who very much mirrors Kyle reese from the first film, she has nightmares, but she holds her own against the T1000. Now we come to Sarah in Genesis, she acts like she is Sarah Conner but i just could not believe her in that character, there are key moments in the T2 that show just how capable she is, Shotgun one handed, using just a pistol to keep SWAT away long enough to get out, nearly killing miles dyson, her whole character in T2 was believable because she acted like she could do all those things, Genisys Sarah just wasn't convincing something about her was just too sweet and cute, maybe that was there intention! But to me considering she has been under the guard of a T800 for a decade, I was expecting her to be a lot tougher. John Conner is played by Jason Clarke who isn't bad, but at the same time comes across as all knowing and all knowledgeable, its a difficult area to decide on his role as there have been so many portrayals, but I like the very brief showcase of John in T2 when the future battle is happening and I also really enjoyed Bales portrayal in Salvation, both were intense and Bales one was convincing, Jasons portrayal wasn't bad it just lacked flare!Overall the acting in this film isn't necessarily bad, it just comes across as not convincing, and to a certain degree the director and the person in charge of casting can take some of the flak.What did I enjoy about the movie? there were certain points which I really liked, there is a moment with John walking out of a bunker completely on fire, John getting pulled apart by an MRI machine, the T1000 played by Byung Hun was excellent most of the scenes involving him played out well and were interesting, Skynets introduction was well done also.Overall this to me, is not a bad film but it does have some very glaring flaws, the CGI in this was very obvious and stood out a lot, and again when compared with the first two movies were practical effects were everywhere, its night and day. Now I know some of you are going to say but T2 was known for its CGI, yes it was, but heres the difference, T2 used CGI sparingly, this film used it almost exclusively, the helicopter sequence in T2 was done all practically and here we have a helicopter sequence that looks just unconvincing as hell. Its a shame to me as this could have been an excellent premise to go into but its execution was poor. Out of the 5 movies this has the least replay value beyond watching it twice, suffers from to me bad casting, has an interesting plot that is underutilized and plays out similarly to most reboots of 80s sci fi films, think, Total Recall, Robocop.",Terminator Genisys

With that being said the movie was god awful , i didn't want to finish the movie that's how boring and bad it was. Awful plot and bad acting , worst actor choice award for this movie. Unneeded complicated plot , when the movie ended i wished i would have seen Terminator 1 instead . I wasted my time watching this film , i strongly suggest you not to bother watching it even if the nostalgia for Arnold is too strong. 1/10 being generous, Please don't make a sequel , i m willing to pay money so that a sequel will never be made.",Terminator Genisys
752,joesmaname,Most fans love it - Movie reviewers don't. Which are you?,8,4 July 2015,"I just watched this movie last night and I don't get the hate. If you're a movie reviewer and have no feelings for the franchise one way or the other OR you do like the franchise IN SPITE of Arnold, then you may dislike this film...On the other hand, if you're a Terminator fan that loved the first 2 movies but was left with a bad taste in your mouth after #3, your long, long wait for satisfaction is over, this is what T3 should have been.Arnold is excellent, believably pulling off a 60+ year old cybernetic killing machine, his age plays perfectly into the plot.I was impressed with Jason Clarke's John Connor, the depth to his role is surprising and his performance nailed it.The unexpected JK Simmons is wonderful, stealing every scene his character is in.The rest of the cast have their work cut out for them, they replace beloved actors in this franchise. No small task filling the shoes of Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn and to be honest those shoes were not a perfect fit. It took some time to adjust to them but as the film progressed they grew on me and their relationship does evolved into it's own unique terminator universe experience.Speaking of which, the love for the franchise is evident in the production. Cameron himself approves this film, stating it should be considered the Third official Terminator movie. This coming from the creator of the franchise with no official affiliation other than being a ""Fan Boy"". Don't take my word, Google: James Cameron on Terminator Genisys.One more thing, if you're a fan -STOP reading information about the movie! Go see it! There's way too many spoilers online (especially the trailer - do not watch it) that will diminish your viewing enjoyment, I was delighted and surprised by the plot twists.",Terminator Genisys

Fox and the doc...it's just perfect... I'd add ""hasta la vista, baby"" and ""you could be mine"", by GNR, but hey...you will always ask for more...Thank you Arnold!!! I'll watch it again in the future... And please, get ready to get some nostalgic (not kind of Fast and Furious) but funny nostalgic moments...",Terminator Genisys
754,steelers160,100x's better than the reviews. Better than you will think even with high hopes.,10,24 July 2015,"First of all, DON'T believe the critics reviews. They are the kind of people who give movies like Les Miserables and a bunch of other artistic junk that even they don't understand 10/10 stars, 2 thumbs up, critically acclaimed titles. The critics didn't give this movie a good review because from the start they had their minds made up about how oh there's no way a 67 year old can play an action star and oh this movie franchise has been done to death. Well, by leaving those reviews they have now put the franchise in jeopardy of never making another installment. The horribly misguided reviews caused very poor box office results, mix that with all the other movies coming out before and after that we're must see, the viewers either didn't have the money to spend on tickets (much like myself who wasn't able to see the movie until July 20th after having just spent all my money in Florida) or they read the reviews and may have been turned off to the fact that this could and is a great movie. This is my first review, I didn't even have an IMDb account until now because never felt the need to leave a review but after watching and reading what people are saying I felt I needed to express my opinion. This year I have seen most, if not all the big budget movies like avengers, mad max, Jurassic world, ant man, fast and furious, San Andreas, and the divergent movie, and I can honestly say terminator genisys was almost by far the best. The only reason I say almost is because of the ones I listed, the only one that came close was fast and furious and maybe, maaaybeee avengers. I apologize for the long review so I'm just going to sum it up now. Now that terminator genisys is ending in theaters I can only hope that the public reads reviews like this and buys it on blue ray or on xfinity or some other home viewing way because this is a movie that deserves to at least finish the planned trilogy and possibly even more should we be so lucky. As someone who saw T1 T2 T3 T4 and now T5 in theaters, this was the closest to one and two. Actually, I wouldn't even compare it to the others unless to say ""Hey, that movie was as good as T1 and T2."" Just please, please watch the movie for how it really is instead of how the critics attempted to portray it. The plot made perfect sense, that cast did a great job, and this is by far the most relatable Schwarzenegger character of them all. Just please watch it. You won't be sorry and you won't regret buying it.",Terminator Genisys
755,ryanalexandernoakes,Better than expected.,8,20 July 2015,"There are a lot of film series' with a storyline that runs throughout which means you couldn't walk into a cinema and watch say the 3rd in the series and comfortably know what was going on. The good thing about Terminator Genysis is you don't need to watch the series. I mean, it would help and certainly be better if you knew who Sarah Connor and John Connor was and the basic storyline.Another thing I enjoyed about this film is that it was better than preview and if I'm honest, I didn't expect that. I thought this was one of those films that the best parts in the film are just the 4 minute preview. I was very surprised and pleased that it was more.Something else that I didn't expect and was pleased about, the action. I thought it was just going to be mediocre and with a soft storyline to capture the younger audience. I was wrong, it had it's fair share.The final and most important surprise was that it was better than the reviews. Not many people was rating it highly and it seemed at first it would be like the average rating, it wasn't, it was better.",Terminator Genisys
756,nblackwell-40710,Enjoyable for Anyone,10,29 November 2015,"Emilia Clarke is great in Game of Thrones, but I like her even better as Sarah Connor. Arnold Shwarzenegger also did a great job in his role. Glad to see him back in the Terminator movies. I like all the Terminator movies, but I may like this one even more because of the cast and how they sort of made Sarah's terminator, ""Pops"" kind of like her father. Very funny. I also like that along the way we've seen the machine seem to become more and more human, but in this one they added the human becoming more machine. I don't know if that was an intended metaphor because of humanity's growing need for machines in our lives. I don't know, but it's action packed with just the right amount of comedy and still an interesting storyline to follow along the way. I truly hope they continue the terminator saga with the same cast. I really don't know how it only got a 6.7/10 rating on IMDb. I believe people just enjoy taring things down more than building them up. I'd say just about anyone could enjoy watching this movie.",Terminator Genisys
757,abhishekinfo-78528,Excellent rework of the original plot,10,5 July 2015,"This movie's best part is the excellent rework of the original concept of The Terminator. The movie depicts the issues of time traveling at various points for a single event, that can change the outcome. This is normally not seen in other Sci-fi movies where mostly only one time travel is captured for an event. Arnold's acting is superb as Pops and so are the other characters. This movie has created a new interest among the viewers, which will keep them waiting for other two parts of Terminator Genesis scheduled to be released in 2017 and 2018. The graphics are excellent and so are the special effects.",Terminator Genisys
758,anthonyrjwood,Pops...,4,28 July 2015,"With zero expectation of continuity from the initial two Terminator movies, it may perhaps deserve a 5/10. However, having gone in to see Arny in all his former glory, I was faced with ""Pops""; Arny / Terminator has been adopted as the guardian of Sarah Conner, who calls him ""Pops."" In fact, there's absolutely no reference to him being called the Terminator; he's quite simply called pops for the entire movie, which becomes extremely tedious. Why pops? Why and how he's become this in the movie isn't explained at all. He's just there. He's just pops.The awful script beefed up with a nonsensical idea about time travel. None of it adds up at all. You're feeling confused, and stop even bother following the main plot, due to having been disgraced by the tragic babble. The new time travel theories say goodbye to the former franchise entirely. This movie should have been called: ""Pops: Genisys XXX."" Watch without any hope of enjoyment. Watch for Pops.",Terminator Genisys
759,raficheck,It's how should The Terminator's next chapter look like,6,20 October 2015,"When I first saw T5 trailer I thought it's gonna be rubbish and unworthy of my attention. The epic conclusion of the great series seemed to be clumsy fusion of former brilliant ideas and essential quotes, without its own invention. Bearing the name of classic, nevertheless directed in order to rip some glory off the old but still unreachable Judgement Day (I skip T3 and Salvation intentionally, T1 after all these years still in tolerable shape). Well, it finally came out and as a fan of the best Arnie's role ever I couldn't let my insights dominate my own opinions... And goddamn it! I like it! Shame on me? I don't think so.I referred to many other reviews and noticed this - people still believe that Arnold Schwarzennegger, who almost reached his 70', still can act and move like in his 40'. Not only believe but almost demand him to do so. For real?! I would love to see you in 20-30-40 years from now on, dealing with your daily routines with such energy and bounce. There is no way Arnold could perform same show as he did in Judgement Day, over 20 years ago, and if you claim this - shame on you. Of course many other Hollywood stars become more and more attractive to the audience as they are getting older and older but hey, their roles are based on workshop rather than physical condition and abilities. Top guns of our beloved action beat'em up style movies play mostly with their body not their soul. Arnie's cyborg depends on quite different things than i.e. Joker in Nolan's Dark Knight or Andy Dufresne in Darabont's Shawshank Redemption. T-800 steals the show with his durable will to complete his mission at all cost (even his own termination), with the aura of unstoppable brute force invented to either kill or protect his target. And Arnie had to be extremely convincing in other way than Joker etc. In his days of greatness he could easily dominate the movie only with massive musculature and face mimic. Nowadays most of his physical qualities are gone and Arnold is forced to compensate this with his presence only and, what is most important, with his acting skills. Try to imagine Heath Ledger playing the Joker without make up and you will understand what I am up to. Same role, same actor, but something is missing, something irreplaceable. And that is exactly the new Terminator - lacks something that wont ever come back but still contains one of the best movie role ever created, moreover with the best actor ever born to play this role. It still works for me because i don't demand Schwarzennegger to be younger when his carrier comes to an end. I come to terms with this fact but don't wont him to be replaced by some other guy. Terminator is Arnie and Arnie is T-800. Period. No one should ever recreate this character and the day when Arnold gives up his career should be the last day of T- 800 life.As it comes to the movie itself, yeah, there were few unnecessary scenes and Genisys could be better without them. I could accept some comic parts in Judgement Day (T1 didn't have them from what I remember) but they were so subtle that became perfect supplement to the action packed joy ride. T3 brought to much of them and the whole seemed to be half a comedy half an action sci-fi movie. And the terminator himself lost some of his, dunno, majesty...? Salvation is near the first one (grim and sombre) and Genisys shows something between second and third one (more than needed still too less to destroy the atmosphere). The script could spare us some few moments like scenes where T-800 shows some traits toward humankind (unforgettable retarded smile). Also few lines are like out of this movie and could be erased for the better final effect. And of course using same old quotes from the first two parts isn't the best option for some of viewers (on the other hand many of them will love that). But thats all! To be total honest with myself I can't find any more annoying things about Genisys. The plot is well twisted, not to much to confuse the audience but still enough. The Terminator is still tough and relentless (same for all bad guys). Special effects are ""nothing to complain about"" which is not as obvious as it should be these days. There are scenes essential to the movie and they are filled with some chills-giving shots and background music. There are moments of unexpected twists, epic beatings and even touching parts. I loved it. There is one more thing I must mention about - the writer and the director made an effort to avoid weak points from the last two episodes and focus on the first two. They didn't take the short way and cut off coupons from the best installments and tried to create their own path which IMHO totally fits the original reality. Applaus! Of course some will say there are plot holes in the script. Truly there are but keep in mind the Genisys creators had to face complicated time lines and time paradoxes - they did impressive good work with reducing them to minimum. I believe some of them just couldn't be avoided after all these plots created within years. Nothing really to mention.I saved the best thing for last! If you watched the trailer, forget it. It builds the wrong statement about the film. Just give it a chance and don't forget the world has changed since the Judgement Day, and so Arnold has changed. He doesn't make such an impression like 20 years ago but still provides some unspeakable emotions every time he shows on the screen. Genisys totally deserves better rating than Rise of The Machines and Salvation. 8/10.",Terminator Genisys
760,Punjana,"A Confusing Mess and..... Oooo, explosions",1,11 July 2015,"What is there to talk about in this film? NOTHING. It is garbage, garbage of epic proportions.When you look at a playing card from the front it seems fully formed, but from the side it's very VERY thin. Not only is this Movie very thin, when you look at it from the front..... IT'S FULL OF HOLES, plot holes!!!What is going on in la-la land (Hollywood) that gets this film even made? Seems to me its just a 'no heart, no soul' corporate decision to suck money from the masses with another of the back catalogue 'FRANCHISE' movies? There must be like a wheel of fortune with X-Men, Iron Man, Terminator, Spiderman, Superman, Hulk, Wolverine etc etc etc on it, spin it and where it lands, it gets made. They cast good looking, not a hair out of place Model types, Instead of relatable, believable actors in the lead roles. (Emilia Clarke looks like she's struggle with a heavy handbag) Basically nobody making this movie gives a rats if the film is any good, they just know it will make money. And it's IS all about the $$$What ever happened to story telling or plots that make sense, maybe weaving past/future movies together. But that is difficult when T3 & Salvation where themselves 'heart and soulless' films simply made as cash cows. Instead we are treated to mindless movies made up around STUNT SEQUENCES and yet more CGI.How does that meeting go? Is it a room full of Hollywood types, tech geeks, stunt men and pyro dudes brainstorming?Tech Geek: We got this really neat 'NEW' software that can do the best T3000, it's totally neat.Pyro Dudes: We explode cars, trucks, boats, buildings, we even explode things than don't normally explode.Stunt Man: Can I be set on fire, I like being set on fire.Hollywood Type: I want more than just exploding cars.Stunt Man: Well, I guess we can crowbar another action sequence 'for no specific reason' somewhere in to the script.Hollywood Type: We don't have a script.Arnie: No script? but I need to learn my Lines NAOW damn it!!Hollywood Type: just say ""I'll be back"" you'll be great.Is this how films are made now?

761,hedgiereviews,Give it a chance!,8,14 July 2015,"Okay so this is my first review and there is a specific reason as to why i chose this film. For starters before i went to watch this movie i read up on the reviews and found that a lot of people did not find it very good. At this point i thought it did not stand a chance to impress me. I was wrong.First off the introduction made me smile and i straight away knew that i had misjudged this movie. Being a big fan of Judgment Day, i found it quite hard to believe this film would prove critics wrong. But it did. CGI was great, acting was spot on, action was non stop and the excitement had me on the edge of my seat!I believe most of the bad reviews are because this film had comedy in it and for a terminator film comedy will not fit very well. But by golly the comedy was done right! Emilia's character explains the reason behind the comedy is because she is teaching the main terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to be more human. I mean this is the way comedy is done right. A robot learning to be human... Its gold. OK don't get me wrong, it wasn't the funniest movie nor the corniest, it was just done to perfection.Action, comedy, violence, excitement, the future, robots and guns all fit in to perfection.",Terminator Genisys

Arnold Schwarzenegger, as always, was incredible as the Terminator for the fourth time ('Salvation' had to used CGIed Arnold). The rest of the cast was pretty memorable, especially J. K. Simmons as the detective or police officer or whatever.Yes, the plot was a bit familiar (the protagonists trying to stop Judgment Day with a Terminator while battling robot threats like the T-1000 and T-800), but fortunately the twists (!!!MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!: John Connor transformed into a FREAKING TERMINATOR!!!) were so entertaining you could forget about the major similarities. Some of the dialogue was pretty bland too, but don't all movies have that? To be honest, this wasn't as good as The Terminator or T2, but is much better than Rise of the Machines and much much better than Salvation (the former was still good while the latter was disappointing). The visuals are as good as ever, and the characters are pretty fun as well. I initially wasn't that hyped for this movie compared to the likes of Avengers 2 or Jurassic World, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. A job well done Paramount.

763,antoninusjohnson,Not so nasty but fun,7,12 August 2015,"The first terminator movie is still the best. The scenes were more brutal, the terminator uncompromising.At first I thought it was interesting that the Game of Thrones would have two actors who had played Sarah Connor. Who would play the better Sarah, Emilia or Lena? This was the first outing of Sarah since Terminator 2. Emilia didn't bulk up the way Hamilton did for Terminator 2 but this didn't mean Emilia couldn't fight, she could kick ass just the same with convincing ease. Emilia moved convincingly between playing love interest and mother to John ConnorEvery terminator movie makes an adjustment to Judgement day and this film is no different. You will need to pay attention as the pace of the movie is slow, quick, quick.Arnold put in a good performance more liken to Terminator 2. John Connor role was less convincing of the major roles.This film was a through back to Terminator 2 not quite on the same level but the best since.

764,nrwalke,Big Booms that are Super Cool if you Don't Think,6,20 October 2015,"Eh. The other reviews are right about this movie. I happened to watch it while drinking. Now, when I was younger, the Terminator movies were just awesome. They showed the darker side of the usually pastel-and-spandex depictions of the 80s common to the time (Blade Runner pulls a similar gig, as does Lost Boys).This doesn't have any of that. If you're drinking, and you want a chill movie where lots of things blow up and the story is passable ENOUGH, this is it. It's not bad at what it does. It's not trying to win an Oscar. Nah, this is one of those ""international money"" things, closer to Transformers. That's where the money's at nowadays.So because I was drunk, and things went boom, and Arnold looked particularly tank-like (I'm told he won an award from a website for holding guns correctly in the film?), and it was just all ""pachew!"" and there was a T-1000 and they made John Connor evil and he was like... the nanotech version of the T-1000. I think it was called the T- 3000. It was purty suh-weet. And, Ah-nuld. Hence, 6.Yes, the story stumbles drunkenly around, knocking into things. Yes, the characters are woefully miscast (except Emilia Carter, who I like for this role, though I don't think she's all that great of an actress overall). Yes, the story very quickly and cheaply retconns basically the entire series so far. Yes, it's confusing as all get out.But it's still fun, and no whiny Eddie Furlong to make me *want* to drink. I'd say not as good as T2, but as close to a T1 remake as 2015 can get. It wasn't bad. I just won't remember much of it clearly, like the thumb in T2 or the quick-cut gunshots in T1. But eh.

768,klotzmh,Great film!,8,22 January 2020,"Terminator Genisys is an awesome movie, it is very underrated but has one flaw that keeps on bugging me, the film doesn't look like 1984 but besides that the film is awesome. The whole film from start to finish is action packed, which in this case you want. The CGI and visuals are gorgeous, the 27% on Rt is in no way a way do describe this amazing film, i have seen Jurassic World about 4 times and they just overused the CGI to the point where the film wasn't all that impressive, CGI wise. But in Terminator Genisys a lot of the effects are practical, before i watched this i expected it to be a worse film than Terminator Salvation, but after watching it boy was i wrong. So overall me being a huge Terminator fan i loved this film and hope to see more like it in the future for the Terminator franchise.",Terminator Genisys

770,kcebenoyan,Stereotype assembled Hollywood movie but fun to watch,7,28 June 2015,"I am a great fan of Terminator 1 and 2 and Arnold Schwarzenneger is one of the fabulous idols in my life. What made me a fan of the first two movies were the great tension of robot chasing human, simple - not jumping scene to scene scenario and little speech - only enough to clarify the events. While watching a movie, I just like to focus on the chase, not like beating my brain over the speeches and results of conflicts of different time dimensions. This movie is like a soup, the screenwriters and the director mixed everything: There are travels to times of the previous movies, same scenes recaptured with other actors, some inspiration of Back to the Future movie and some jokes added as spice.What I was expecting was to feel a leveraged robot - human chasing tension and did not get it. If a robot, network, cyborg, whatever is about to kill a human, it shouldn't waste its time by explaining the situation to the intended victim.Although the movie did not exactly met my expectation, 3D effects are very good, Arnold is still fit, acts perfect and you can enjoy nostalgia for the previous movies. Not a cult, but a fun to watch movie.",Terminator Genisys
771,pgillespie,Well-executed,8,27 November 2015,"I was sceptical going to the theatre to see this.I'm not too sure what people have against it - and no, I'm not really caring to ask. The effects were great, the 1984 scenes were recreated almost perfectly shot-for-shot as the original (too bad Bill Paxton didn't reprise his role as one of the punks at the observatory).If I could pick one thing to complain about, it's that I thought the role of John Connor was poorly cast; there's nothing wrong with the actor or his acting, I just felt he didn't have as commanding a presence as somebody like Christian Bale. But that's nit-picking. The actress playing Sarah Connor did a great job, and did remind me of Linda Hamilton in certain ways, minus the big 80's hair.I'm not a fan of comic relief for the sake of just throwing it in, and I think this movie handles comedic parts respectably.It's a movie about time travel and killer robots, people...quit bitching about it and just enjoy it, as it completely makes up for Terminator 3.",Terminator Genisys
772,igor-karlovic,A classic gone sour,4,12 July 2015,"For me this movie was utterly boring, at the end I just didn't care what will happen. Why? Because the characters have just not stick on me. There is no chemistry between the main characters, the moment when they try to be funny was awkward not funny (except the grins of Arni). Emilia is just to fragile for this part and has baby face and is not believable. Jason Clarke just has not the ""mojo"" to bring this out. The story-line tries to be smart with the complicating alternative time things but this is baby food for Inception for example. A sour end to a good series. And how was Arnie upgraded in melting polymer metal at the heart of explosion?",Terminator Genisys

This movie did a good job for the series summary, however it has some goofs. The older Schwarzenegger is funny and more professional. The rating shouldn't be less than 7 (I give it 8).High budget action movie with great crew, very entertaining, and I don't know what's up with the dudes who don't like it! If you are looking for perfect stuff, it won't be always there, so you could go with the good ones, and this movie is defiantly one and highly recommended for Terminator, Arnold or Sci-Fi movies fans.",Terminator Genisys
774,snookynumber1,Could have been better but was better than the last two,7,4 July 2015,"I'd probably give this movie a 7.5 out of 10 rather than an eight and it's slightly better than the average 7..I've been a big fan since I was about 10 years old, I snuck into the cinema to see Terminator 2 at that age and was absolutely taken by it..I had high hopes for this movie after hearing James Cameron praise it, I can see why he did, it was very loyal to his movies.It was so close to being a really good film but a few things let it down..Negatives - Kyle Reece was badly cast, he didn't look, sound or act any thing like Michael Biehn's Kyle Reece.. It was the first negative thing that crossed my mind while watching, his intro speech was great but the 2029 scene where he talks to John in the corridor before they attack Skynet left me feeling as though his performance wasn't as good or as believable as John Connors which then bugged me through out the rest of the movie every time he spoke..Sarah Connor for me wasn't comparable to Linda Hamilton's character, you could say this was because of the altered time line but still, Linda Hamilton's Sarah was far more mature by that age, surely there's an aspect of a person's soul that always feels like them throughout their whole lives? Anyway the new Sarah felt a little too much like something out of a teen sitcom than a bad ass that's anticipating the end of the world.. Her performance wasn't bad, but it wasn't the Sarah Connor we all know and expected..The music wasn't eerie enough, the music from T1 and T2 was dark, especially T2 where it was twisted and haunting.. this movie was more orchestra based which gives it a different feel... i.e while they were being chased by the T1000 it just didn't have the same suspense.. I remember reading or hearing the Brad Fiedel had sampled metal hitting metal and tried hard to give the music a metal edge, also much was synthesised if not all, rather than orchestrated.. Something that every Terminator movie has failed with since T2... It makes a huge difference in my opinion, I'm not saying it was all bad, parts of it were good.. the best tune though was the one at the end credits.. which was just a copy of Brad Fiedel's intro to T2..The use of that Terminator tune every time Arnie did something.. you know the one, bam bam.. bam.. bam bam.. it just made it feel cheesy!! I hope someone does a fan edit of this and removes it!!! Something that didn't add up was how/why they travelled from 1984 to 2017 thus skipping on John being conceived and born.. this seemed like a major plot hole for me.. why bother trying to kill Sarah Connor if she's not even going to give birth to John Connor any way!! it doesn't makes sense.. like most of the time travel stuff.. but then since T1 it never made sense anyway.. maybe they'll try and tie this up in the next one, if there is another..They ruined the twist with John Connor by showing it in the trailer..The happy cheesy ending, it wasn't bad but it wasn't typical of a Terminator movie!!!Positives -The intro to the movie was moving, I watched this at an imax theatre in 3D and the start of the movie got me quite emotional.. It was really quite good!The future war scene, though rather short lived was really good, something I'd wanted to see since the first Terminator movie, they totally nailed the feel of it.The quality of the CGI in the young Arnie, this was mind blowing, he looks real!!Arnie was actually pretty good as the ageing Terminator..The story was actually pretty good, despite some of the plot holes.The fact that it was loyal to the first two movies and basically ignored the events T3 and Salvation.The way they had recreated the scenes from the first Terminator movie was really good, a lot of attention to detail, though the punks had different hair which was odd!! The overall visual effects throughout the movie were really good, a couple of times the CGI was noticeable but not much..Summary - If they had tried a little harder to get the casting of those two main characters right then I think the movie would have done much better.. Also they should have focused on getting someone to create a more haunting sound track like Fiedel's work on T2, it was only half way there.. They pretty much nailed everything else.. so close but not close enough.. Go and see it, it's not a bad movie but it lacked the suspense and realism of Cameron's movies..",Terminator Genisys
775,twangark,One of the best in the series,8,29 September 2015,"Now the title picture of this movie made me feel like it would be one of those dark and gloomy terminator movies. However, I was totally wrong, it was actually funny in some parts. Coming to the main point; this movie really brought time-travel to the forefront which has actually been the basis of all the previous terminator movies but never quite got the attention. The previous movies focused on a particular point in time and never really took the entire time-travel phenomenon in a spectrum. This latest movie brought the whole series together and has made it worthwhile for the terminator fans.

776,VorteXz90,"worst terminator so far, it's completely messed up",1,4 July 2015,"I will start by saying that T1 and T2 are my favorite movies of all time, I am a huge fan of Terminator franchise, I toughed T3 was an OK T movie, Terminator Salvation was also OK with pretty massive fight scenes. When I first heard that there will be a reboot of the series I said: yay , we will finally see T1 and T2 with modern days CGI.But now, after getting out of the cinema I am sorry that I ever watched this movie, it completely destroyed my childhood movies. Action: This is a complete mess, it's like watching a TV show with little episodes tied together.All other T movies have big stories developed, but in this movie it's like seeing more little stories tied up together, you see a little of T1 t-800 terminator( a 2 minute fight scene), you see a little of t1000 which has worse CGI than T2 which was made like 25 years ago,you see a little of future war,then you have thrown in some other stupid fight scenes that are short and not entertaining at all.Story: The story is so messed up and completely removes the mystery which T1 and T2 gave us.The story is not focused at all, and besides that they destroyed everything that we loved about Terminator movies.They made John Connor a villain, what's the whole point of this ?WTF were they thinking ?Skynet tried so much in T1 and T2 to kill john Connor by killing her mother and then himself, but then all of a sudden all that was a stupid effort, they just created him a robot when they had the chance of killing him.Acting: worst actors ever, Emilia Clarke is worst Sarah Connor ever, Kyle Reese is nothing what T1 offered us,even TS had a much better Kyle Reese.John Connor is OK, but not great, kid John Connor from T2 is 10000000x better than John Connor grown JC from T G. The only good actor in this movie was Arnold himself, he played pretty well with what the director gave him.Alan Taylor did such a bad bad job with this movie, when I saw Thor movie I toughed he will do a decent job with the Terminator movie but this is worst worst T movie I ever saw.If I was to rate this as a stand alone summer action movie I would probably rate it as a 6.5 maybe a 7 out of 10 But being a Terminator movie, It simply is an insult to the franchise, I can't rate it more than 4/10. I'm still wondering how James Cameron can rate this as a true T3? What was he thinking ?",Terminator Genisys

This new one is way better then first, salvation and third one, but close or on the same level as judgement day. The movie is the first 4 movies combine in an alternate timeline and there's a lot of time traveling going on. The story is really good even though John connor is a terminator, but somehow all this works. I honestly don't know where they can go after this movie. this should end the whole series. But i guess the post credit reveal that skynet/genysis harddrive is not destroy oh and the T-800 ""POPS"" become a T-1000. One thing that did annoy me was kyle resse and the actor who plays him, he's annoying and pretty useless. This movie was fun and entertaining, Emilia clarke is beautiful, love her, and Arnold kicks ass. this was one of the movies that surprise me this summer just like Jurassic world, wow two great movies in a road after stinkers like Mad Max (overrated movie with no story) and tomorrowland. great summer so far :)",Terminator Genisys

780,paulfarey,Unnecessary Reboot,4,15 November 2015,"For some, the series should have ended at the end of Terminator 2, which was perhaps one of cinema's best sequels, compared to the typical poor quality follow-ups churned out as cash-cows by lazy studios. Without going into the mistakes of the other movies in the series here, I'll ignore them, which is what I should have done with Terminator Genisys.The basic idea is largely unchanged from the plot of the film series, with the very start of this movie being set prior to the events that start off the original Terminator. The human resistance in the future, led by John Connor, are winning the war against Skynet and send Kyle Reese back in time to follow the recently dispatched Terminator, and protect Sarah Connor, arriving in 1984. Genisys is this story.OK, so far, so familiar. You see, the thing is, we know what's going to happen now. It's The Terminator movie. We've seen it already! So that do they need to do to make it fresh and interesting to watch? Clearly the writers didn't know either, so they decided to watch the previous movies, understand the canon, and butcher it. The result is a variation on the original by creating an alternate time-line. Yes I understand there was little left to do with the film series because we'd essentially ended up at the end of the original pre-defined time-line, but no one was shouting out for a new Terminator movie.Which is good, because we haven't really got a new Terminator movie. This carries the name, that's all. All of the elements that made the first two amazing, that made them the films we love, are gone from this instalment. There is no consistent storyline, no build up, no character development, and, worst of all, no tension. I don't just mean the edge of the seat thrills where you don't know whether they'll escape the relentless Terminator, but also the sexual tension between Reese and Sarah Connor. Schwarzenegger's crude references to ""mating"" are just as cringe-worthy as the lack of chemistry between the two leads.As for the characters and the actors playing them... I appreciate this version's Sarah Connor is meant to be more bad-ass than the timid Sarah Connor from the original, but Linda Hamilton did a much better performance of this in T2. Kyle Reese has none of the sizzling charisma and intensity that made Michael Biehn so compelling, and Schwarzenegger spent the whole film trying to convince us that neither he, nor his septuagenarian ""Guardian"" Terminator, were obsolete. Then we get to the plot holes. Lots and lots of plot holes, like: who sent back the Guardian to the 70's to protect Sarah Connor when she was a child? Who sent back the T1000 to the same time to kill her? Who sent back the other T1000 back to 1984? How can a T1000 restore a dead T800 just by dropping a bit of it's own liquid steel into it? Why does Skynet have to wait for a countdown to its release date? Why did I watch this all the way to the end?In short, pick out your old DVD collection, watch T1 and T2 again, and forget that this one was ever made.",Terminator Genisys

I loved this one as well UNTIL John Connor showed up as Terminator. Why? It was a joke! Totally ruined the original idea of the unstoppable terminator. He could have killed Sarah and Reese any time to make sure Judgement day does happen and didn't. What joke. Please, make more Terminator movies but don't forget what made the franchise so successful: Arnold's initial idea of the UNSTOPPABLE terminator. And Arnold was the one who came up with the idea, not even James Cameron. And that's what made the first movie successful. And the second. The start of this movie was great! I was hooked. I didn't know what was going to happen. I could have continued without John just with Sarah, Reese, and Arnold as Terminator where they are trying to break into Skynet to blow up the whole place or something. With some more surprises on the way. Would have been much better.",Terminator Genisys

For normal people, who only have 2 hours to spare for entertainment this movie will not make much sense. The movie includes many ideas of first importance but because it is so complex and convoluted it fails to bring the best of these concepts and instead remains a mess of concepts. It fails hugely to movies that tackle these concepts individually and mange to leave viewers with new ideas and states to pounder on. Movies like Oblivion, Edge Of Tomorrow and of course the great Jupiter Ascending. Even the time travel element is just a level of confusion and fails intellectually to movies like Looper and that great movie released recently where the main character goes back in time and has sex with him/her-self (forgot its name . )The great movies mentioned above are great of our time because they send, even secretly so, the messages that truly describe our times and our imminent future. Where this terminator movie just lives 20 years ago. And no, I don't think original Terminator fans would love this one, except maybe in the most extreme religious brains which did not develop in the last 20 years. The scene where they got naked was crying for a joke or something but the movie didn't deliver anything there  The guy hadn't had sex for a while and then he gets naked with the girl whose pic he carried during war time I mean come on you can't pull such a scene without a joke.

This movies was a disaster, I was one of the first to comment on here and predict the crappy choice of actors, visual effect and almost the entire crappy decisions made to make it. I am not going to criticize the story line here. First of all it sucks to see a movie made in 2015 that has crappier CG effects then a movie made in 1991. From the start till the end of the movie is just a crappy scene after another. The jokes are out of place and the acting is beyond horrible. The music and sound effect. I am going to guess here and say that they ran out of money and hindered interns to do the job. Nothing seems to match, it is almost as of they were running out of time and just threw some sound from youtube. As I said if you want to watch a movie that is mostly the same quality of any B rated movie this will be it.With all the money spent, i still cant figure out y they did not higher a director like Christopher Nolan. The idea was to make something that will revamp the franchise. Not something that resembled the The Sarah Connor Chronicle.

If you're a huge fan of the Terminator franchise, this will most likely meet your quota for explosions, smashing cars, shootouts, cyborg-on-cyborg violence, and references to earlier movies. But, if you're a huge fan like me, the story will make no sense what so ever, especially if you compare and contrast the ending of Judgement Day and Genisys.

I thought the storyline was rather great and provided some good plot twists, it was serious when it needed to be and had some good little bits of comedy which didn't at all feel forced. I have seen all the terminator movies and it should leave the viewer much more satisfied than terminator salvation. Actors do a fine job and its good to see similar faces take on a different role in films like these seeing as some are really only just spicing up their career.

788,ydex666,So much potential... wasted by a rushed superficial script,5,23 August 2015,"I was REALLY looking forward to this one after the disaster known as Terminator: Salvation.If I'd make a top 5 list of Terminator movies it would be something like this:1. Terminator - 9/10 2. T2 - 8.7/9 3. T3 (basically a lesser remake of T2)/ T:Genisys 6.5/10 . . . 99. T: Salvation 3/10Even though Terminator is showing it's age it still gives you the strong feeling of an adversary that will never stop, will always be on your heels... just like a quote from the movie: ""It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead."" T2 took the concept and made a terrific action movie in the same way that Aliens took a different direction from Alien. T3 is in it's core a rewrite of the T2 script. It's a fun popcorn flick with tons of destruction and so on but the story is weaker and simpler than T2. I'll totally skip mentioning Salvation, it's not worth mentioning. Terminator: Genisys started in an interesting way and it did have moments that I enjoyed. Unfortunately it seems the script was dumbed down, ignoring plot holes and utilizing a silly ""alternate time line"" explanation for what is basically a kind of reboot. It WAS fun to see Arnold again but I felt the whole movie could have been so much better. It's clear the ending was made with a sequel in mind. We'll see if it will be green-lit. I hope they do more work on the script. With that said, it's not a bad movie, it just doesn't reach the echelons of the first two movies.",Terminator Genisys

And I am really glad that they made a new sequel to the series which every fan will love and appreciate. Loved the Arnold vs. Arnold fight scene where they have the younger Arnold in the first Terminator movie fight the older ""but not obsolete"" Arnold of the new movie. Guess who won this fight? Loved that Emilia Clarke was cast as Sarah Connor, now she can say that she isn't only the ""mother of dragons"" but also mother to John Connor, the hero (?) in this movie. I think she did her action scenes well. Loved Arnold's one-liners which can be funny at times. As you all know, Arnold was the original villain in this movie, designed to terminate John Connor, the leader of the human resistance. And through out the series, they had twisted the character of Arnold from being the original killer terminator to a role of guardian or protector of the hero. This movie, Genisys have tried to twist this plot line some more by making John Connor, the original hero and leader of the human resistance to become a protector of Skynet, the anti human computer program, making John a villain in this movie. The action scenes were well paced with the story line making this movie quite entertaining as well.

Most of the time my Family and Friends find that to be nicely done but once in a while even they find it to be too salty or sarcastic. So please read at your own risk! Minor spoilers ahead!Few films set the bench marking. Back in early 80's there was this film - Ground breaking CGI effects, Superb set pieces and a plot with a few words like it's lead actor. That was Terminator 2. The original is a cult classic but for mass and global market T2 did the job.30 years later Hollywood is still spinning the tried and tested brand. Same Characters etc. Plot? 3 words - Time Travels. Cyborgs. Kills. Oops.. that's four words. Anyway after watching Terminator franchise as a fifth installment, you will be forgiven for this miscounting :) I want to be fair here. Compared to the two previous (installments - or different tales on the plot, anyone?) the team behind this particular one have done a better job. That includes the big Gubernator :PThe Judgment day is different now so is the pseudo science behind all that time traveling, future technology etc. But the good thing is that it is enjoyable. The set pieces look very CGI but still believable. The Characters ( this is the funny part - they themselves are confused with all those time-lines and alternate realities etc but you will have a smirk on your face watching them) Not many films have done this in the recent past and for that alone the price of admission is worth .As for the cast which is relatively unknown except Schwarzanegger they have done a commendable job. I was impressed by all three leads, especially Emilia Clarke as Sarah Conor. I originally had doubts about her playing Sarah Conor as good as Linda Hamilton but she has done a good job with what scope she had. So did Jason Clarke and Jai Courtney. A big improvement from their previous franchisee installments.As for Arnold it seems the man realizes his extent of star power and wants to underplay but the studio is having none of it. He is actually good with self deprecating humor and his iconic one liners. I would rather see him like this but then being a Super star also has its own burdens.One thing that is a letdown is BGM and Sound effects. Somehow they sounded as an add-on and clunky.Overall this is a good requel ( wink..wink, Hollywood here is a word), sequel or even if you want to call it a rehash. It is fun has some clever moments but as with all sequels and such people will always compare with the originals so there you have it. Thanks for reading.3.5 stars out of 5",Terminator Genisys

If you wait to rent it I think you'll be satisfied with it, but I wouldn't waste big bucks on seeing it in the theater.Specifically the storyline is very marginal.

And we can all forget the previous two Terminator abominations - because we've got a new abomination which follows on from the first two Terminator movies.In the future, after a nuclear holocaust, we have good nutrition and access to a great workout programme. On the flip side, humanity has been enslaved. And Kyle Reese has turned into a metrosexual. And Doctor Who is Skynet. What?Anyhoo, a few nanobots later, Arnie subverts the entire Chuck Norris internet meme, and beats himself up. Ironically proving what we already knew - that the original Terminator is superior to the new Terminator. Stealing some leftover plot from the Sarah Connor chronicles they get nekkid and do some time travel. Why? because Kyle is determined to make a manful decision. Afterwards John Connorbot highlights the holes in the plot, Sarah Connor whines like an angsty teenager and Popsinator bonds with Kyle Cheese in Sarah's well-equipped but pointless armoury.The End.Unfortunately, it looks like the future is set, there will be more sequels.",Terminator Genisys

There is nothing wrong with any of the actors, although Jason Clarke I find to be a really odd choice for John Connor. And, Sarah Connor, is a good actor, I liked her but, Linda Hamilton was a soldier, through and through and her first allegiance was to humanity and she never strayed from that even in the face of cyborgs and liquid shape shifters. The movie just doesn't produce that feeling that I got while watching the original ones, that feeling that they had to do this for me and every other person sitting in the audience. We were all in on it together. I didn't like the movie really but, maybe a new generation of fans will be born.",Terminator Genisys

796,stevenmcfaul,TG May not reach the heights of T2 but its still a refreshing entry in the series,9,4 July 2015,"Let me start by saying this film does not deserve the universal panning it is receiving by critics. There still seems to be a bunch of people out there who like to whine and complain about how nothing will ever top T1 and T2 that they probably hated this film before they even watched it. In my honest opinion...this will was great. It introduced a fresh take on the series, it had emotional depth and the characters were well cast. Emilia Clarke proved her acting chops as Sarah Connor and was able to show her action heroine side whilst also showing the sensitive side we see quite often in GoT. Jason Clarke and Jai Courtney played John Connor and Kyle Reese brilliantly with each stepping easily into the role and exploring sides of the character we have never seen before. Arnie as always was brilliant, he has stepped back into this role as if it were only yesterday and with doors open that allow him to explore sides to the T-800 we've never seen before. He creates a number of humorous moments that you can't help but smile at and his relationship with Emilia Clarke in the film is excellent. The CGI in this film is also outstanding, it's great to see just how realistic the terminator world looks in 2015 (especially seeing how cgi has made the T- 1000 even more bad-ass)! The story is excellent and not much can be given away without spoilers but it is safe to say that 1984 is very very different from the first film and Sarah Connor is not who we expect her to be. The only downfall for me was that the time travel and alternate timelines can become quite confusing but thankfully it starts to become much clearer towards the end! Overall, without having to spoil the film, this is a must see for any terminator fan...with nods to the original film and mind blowing changes I had goosebumps at a great deal of moments. Ignore the reviews and go see this film...lets just hope this franchise isn't terminated anytime soon!",Terminator Genisys
797,marrich2009,Hollywood soup for the catatonic,1,11 July 2015,"Against all odds I was amazed I made it to the end of this movie. I only wish I could go back in time and tell my wife to talk me out of the suggestion I made to see Terminator Genisys. The original Terminator movie is a cult classic and yes, the remade scenes entertained me on a nostalgia level but as for the rest of the script, it played out like an episode of neighbours. The acting was terrible, the casting was terrible, the action sequences...If I said, give me $170 million dollars for me to take a dump and then I'll feed it to the masses and make a profit, you'd think I was insane - yet Hollywood does it again. Another 3 dimensional turd (yes I sadly paid the extra for the 3D which only really amounted to feeling like someone was actually shi**ing in my face) served up for the intellectually bereft to eat popcorn too. I don't know where these great reviews are coming from, but they're certainly not from Ireland, because in my cinema there was a general feeling of agitation and boredom about an hour into the movie. It felt like Arnie was trying to save the movie by explaining the plot to us, which simply didn't come together, as well as trying to plead with us that his acting days weren't over, even if they were limited to playing an emotionless robot - i.e. the role he has played in all his movies since the 80s.So here's the spoilers, if you can call them that:If I knew that a computer programme was being developed that was going to cause the end of humanity, or at least try to and I had a time machine that would enable me to ""destroy skynet before it's born"" would I really jump to just 24 hours before Judgement Day? I think I may have had the foresight to nip it in the bud a bit earlier.If I was in a bus that flipped and was completely mangled, hanging off a bridge, and I was initially sitting in a passenger seat without a seat belt, I would expect...well..I wouldn't expect anything, I'd be dead. Hardened soldier as he is though, Kyle Reece steps out with the obligatory scratch on his forehead. At one point I thought they were going to reveal that they were all T1000's, the amount of physical abuse they could take.If I could essentially break myself into a floating atomic state, I wouldn't then spend my time struggling to pull myself off a lamp-post through my guts - I would simply float round it, or at least open up the hole so I could walk away without a struggle.If I was a hardened female self made soldier, I would expect that I would show some signs of physical fitness and muscular definition - sorry Emilia, but if the fate of humanity rested on you even being able to act like a militaryesque hero, I'd be guessing it was game over. She looked like she was struggling to run with the props. And yes I know ""militrayesque"" is not a word, so give it 3 minutes after reading this and it will probably appear in a US dictionary.If I had created an explosion that was enough to liquidate an entire compound around me, I doubt I would put my faith in a steel door to save me from the blast. Especially one that a sword handed T1000 has no problem puncturing with with his sword hands.I could go on...and on.As for the chemistry between the two leads, if there was a formula for this and we could create a bomb with it to be used on ""Judgement Day"", the fallout would turn everyone into Keanu Reeves, or Pinocchio.Just awful.All I can say is that all of you so called fans of the original that loved this movie, must have been the result of a 70's fertility drug gone wrong. Seriously, watch it again with your brain stem attached and tell me this even comes close to quality cinema.",Terminator Genisys

Anyway, despite some poor acting and questionable events this movie is still watchable. Some movies I can sit down and watch straight through, others are watch, pause, watch, pause watch.. this one is the latter but I got through it.It's not a very smart movie, there is a lot of ""dumb"" stuff going on.. for example.. the scene where the T1000 is chasing the armored truck and Reese uses the grenade launcher to blow up the car.. why didn't he just do that first? Instead of them waste like a couple hundred rounds of ammunition? Seems like there is a ton of redundant ""filler"" action sequences and far less ""smart"" modern day storytelling/directing...How the hell did Sara Connor know to come smashing in the store?

First, the CGI is just a little over the level of a video game. But that's not even the thing that made me rub my eyes, then hit pause and write this down. What I absolutely can't believe is how terribad the acting is! The opening scene is John Connor planning some raid with Kyle Reese. I swear to God, the acting is the level of a soap television series, think: ""The Bold & the Beautiful"" or ""Days of our Lives"". Seriously! It's stiff, unnatural, it feels scripted....

800,frank_gonzalezrivas,This was made for Terminator fans only,8,16 July 2015,"I can understand why this movie flops badly at the box office. The young viewers cannot be related to the story full of nostalgia and many many references to T1 and T2, but seeing an old Arnie is at the same awesome and awful, because the writers had to explain why the Terminator IS old and this limit the possibilities but I like the blending of the ideas of T1 and T2 to the service of this movie. I love Emilia's Clarke performance because she have enormous expressive beautiful eyes and I felt that she fit the role. In the other hand I don't like Jason Clarke's performance as the villain because is kind of forced and is confusing how he became the bad guy. Also the romance between Kyle Reese and Sarah felt awkward and forced but given the new story they will have plenty of time to ""mate"". I left the cinema with a smile in my face because I really enjoy this movie because it remind me beautiful memories of my childhood watching T1 and T2 and despite Jim Cameron isn't involved I think the filmmakers of this one did a great job, I hope that the trilogy will be made although this one was a bomb, because I would like to watch more terminator movies. The good thing about this movie is the sci-fi fantasy packed with action and the CGI is jaw- dropping (watch closely the young T-800 face) and all the fights are kinetic and mind-blowing, so go to the cinema before is pulled out, is totally worth watching!",Terminator Genisys

It linked into the first 2 films and, while it does not match the brilliance of them, it is still a very enjoyable film. It does rely on the first 2 films for its story line but that doesn't make the film any less fun to watch. Emilia Clarke is a really great actor and played the role spectacularly. My only complaint with regard to Emilia Clarke being Sarah Connor is that her American accent doesn't quite sound right.The opening of the film is set in 2029 and was one of my favorite parts of the film, it looked and sounded great and captured the feel of the war against the machines really well. I think the decision to disregard the 3rd and 4th films was a necessary idea and the film is defiantly worth watching.",Terminator Genisys

Its worth of watching after all give this movie a chance but don't expect miracles. For young and teenagers who didn't watch 90s terminator this seems like a nice fresh start in franchise.

In the past sequels had the reputation of being bad and without a real plot but i think Hollywood doesn't work like that anymore.

805,nomizw-84767,A honorable reboot for the Terminator mythology,7,10 August 2015,"The two first terminator movies were an example of screen writing and this installment is their baby. Is seemed to me as a celebration film of the Terminator myth. It was filmed on the footsteps of James Cameron's direction on Terminator 2 and Aliens, without going further though and without getting boring.The action was all the way and at the same time the story was keeping me on pace with the anxiety of the characters.Although, the story has to do with a time paradox this modern fairy tale sets you in a dilemma. You can stay at the story's gaps or enjoy watching. Story was put together in a believable way that this whole stuff makes sense. And I found myself to enjoy believing it ...because of the Robots. It was the character of T-800 that tied down the movie audiences in 1984 and 1991. In 1984 it was a killing man-shaped machine coming from a dark future. In 1991, T-800 was a friendly robot from the dark future. At this film, writers did a good job introducing an older T-800, due to the now older actor, concentrating on him in a way that gave him a reboot as an old, battle fatigue robot guardian less from a dark future and more of a bright present. Note, that this film is the first PG-13 in the Terminator series too. So, this means that it has much more optimistic atmosphere contrary to the dark first film. Appararently, it has more fight scenes.Nevertheless, Terminator Genisys is an entertaining film to watch and enjoy.",Terminator Genisys
806,twelvegames,Complete waste of 'time',1,12 November 2015,"This movie is so bad I almost feel as though it's my civic duty to warn away others. Aside from the miscast roles, laughable script, and action set pieces so unbelievable and over the top they belong in a cartoon, there's one massive plot hole that leaves this fourth Terminator sequel completely unwatchable. I'll try to sum that up real quick and move on, as this movie barely deserves any reviews at all. Kyle Reese goes back to 1984, as in the first movie, to protect Sarah Connor, although this time we see it happening as it did in the future with John Connor, all scars and ugliness, giving the order and saying goodbye. Any fan of the series already knows that Kyle Reese is John's father, after becoming romantically involved with Sarah Connor back in 1984. In this movie, the beginning plot unfolds in a similar way to the original, except for one major difference. Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese decide to jump ahead in time, from 1984 to 2017 to once again stop Skynet from destroying the world, but when they get there, John Connor, now fully grown and suddenly the bad guy, has traveled back in time himself from 2027 to ensure that doesn't happen. Here's the completely idiotic part of this movie and it simply amazes me that so many talented people can be involved with a story and it's corresponding script... and nobody catches what can be argued as one of the largest, most ridiculous, narrative destroying plot holes ever put on film. When Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese decide to skip ahead from 1984 to 2017, ""before she gave birth to John Connor"", than he simply couldn't have been there in 2017. He'd never been born. So disappointed in this flick. The story makes no sense and no one involved with it seemed to care about that at all. So why watch? Why spend money on the next installment if the same people are involved and first entry in the newly planned trilogy is so bad? Just a complete waste of time.",Terminator Genisys

It was either that or Ted 2 and I thought to myself that at least Terminator has some prequels that I like. But when I saw this I really regretted my decision (took both the bonuses; extreme and 3D). This movie is awful, the jokes are awful, the story is goddamn awful (anyone who says it's clever never read or saw anything clever in his life), the acting is so unimportant since the movie is a bag of s*** and the best actors in the world wouldn't be capable of salvaging anything from it.I saw some 10 star rated reviews and I'm directing this question to you guys (people that rated it with a 7 and up could also count themselves somewhat included), Do you honestly believe that this movie comes even close to classics like: The Godfather, Dr. Strangelove, 12 Angry Men, RobertDeNiro driving a cab, and many others?

I'm a big Terminator fan and loved the original Terminator back in 1985.. and of course loved the most successful of the lot Terminator 2 Judgment Day. A lot of reviewers on IMDb seem to be comparing this film with T2 as though James Cameroon made a master-piece of cinematography, Lets get real it was a great action film, and maybe a cult classic, but never had the best story line ( plot-holes aplenty ) or acting (Arnie is not Laurence Oliver).Having said that, this movie is a great addition to the series and reviewers giving this film 1 or 2 stars are the same as the movie snobs giving the original terrible reviews back in the 80's..

809,perkinsj-25121,A truly BAD movie,4,8 June 2016,"Terminator genisys is the newest installment in the uneven terminator franchise, with the first two films being masterpieces and the last two being crap. This movie thought it would make the series great again by going back to the roots of parts one and two. But it was dead wrong. Instead of going back to the roots of the first two it destroys them and instead becomes the worst movie in the entire franchise!!! Let's get the ""spoiler"" out of the way. I use the word ""spoiler"" loosely because they did indeed use it in the trailer!!! Are you kidding?! Well the spoiler is that John Conner has become a terminator or some crap like that. I kind of don't remember, as a matter of fact I don't really remember the entire last half of the movie! The plot is a complete mess with some app called genisys that's gonna end the world or something along those lines; and they go back to the first film in 1984 which basically in a nutshell makes this entire series super confusing. On a side note the performances by the actors are awful. They're so bland and there's absolutely no emotion, especially Jai Courtney's performance as Kyle Reese which is so bland and unrelatable. On the other side we have Arnold Shwarzenegger as the T-800 which is the best and most lively performance. He still has it. Also the cgi is no better than it was in 1991. Overall this movie is really bad and I don't recommend it to anyone.",Terminator Genisys
810,stevekeiretsu,"Fairly terrible, although non entirely un-enjoyable",4,22 December 2016,"What a mess. If I were a serious hardcore fan of the Terminator series I'd probably be writing a seething, scathing diatribe here explaining why I gave this 1 star.For starters I'm pretty sure the original pair of movies took themselves fairly seriously, whereas this one undermines itself with 'comedy' and 'banter' like it wants to be Terminator Jump Street or something. Except that doesn't fit the franchise, even if the scriptwriters or actors (Courtney in particular) had what it takes to pull it off like Jump Street, which they don't.Now as it happens I was watching this when I was in the mood for something pretty stupid, and I haven't seen T1/T2 for about twenty years, so I'm not going to get too passionate about this ""ruining the franchise"". Part of me strangely enjoyed it, even as part of me felt it rather jarring to the universe.The plot? Erm. Less said about that the better to be honest. A mess of time travel techno-babble that neither makes sense, nor has the force and conviction to pull you along in happy suspension of disbelief.Which leaves the action and even that rather disappointed me. I'm pretty bored of CGI fights where every punch and throw sends the opponent flying clear across the room and smashing into a wall or buckling a car in half with the force of their impact, etc. Maybe if Hollywood hadn't spent the last decade making 18 sequels and reboot installments for every superhero ever scrawled onto a comic book, mostly consisting of this type of fight, it would feel fresh and impressive. But they have, so it doesn't.A few of the action scenes do hit the spot but most of it is pretty lame and derivative.Still, Arnie delivers some nostalgic enjoyment, and at least nobody in this installment gets acted off the screen by a CGI motorbike, like Bale managed to in the last one.So overall this is a fairly bad film but depending on your tastes you might just consider it in the so-bad-it's-good category.",Terminator Genisys
811,airwolf-04881,The Trailers ruined it's success!,8,4 October 2019,"After first watching the film at the cinemas, I thought after the first half it was average at best. However watching it again after home release, it has grown on me to become the favourite after the originals.The effects are brilliant and the story is decent. This was massively impacted in a negative way by the trailers giving away major spoilers and key twists. I am disappointed we won't be seeing the sequels to this.For me the only things that could have made this better apart from the lack of spoilers given, would have been to have had Robert Patrick CGI'd as the T1000. Possibly elements from T2 also. I would imagine this would have been touched on in the sequels if they'd have been made.If you haven't seen the trailers, you will enjoy this film to what was originally intended. If you have it will feel mediocre. However in my personal Terminator ranking, given the new trailers, I would put this one in the top 3 after T1 & 2. Given the choice I would much rather see a sequel to this (with Robert Patrick and elements of Linda Hamilton like Xmen days of future past did with old and new cast) than paying to see Dark Fate. But we will see....",Terminator Genisys
812,alysonburston-36564,The main actor should get more credit,5,30 July 2018,"Say what you want about Terminator 3, but the actor who played Connor in that film (Nick Stahl) does have a bit of resemblance to the original Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), and you believe he's Kyle's son. Jason Clarke and Jai Courtney look nothing alike. Speaking of Kyle, in the original Terminator he was lean, but muscular, and looked like a soldier but not too buff for someone who'd supposedly starved most of his life. Courtney, who plays Kyle in this film, looks like he hits the gym every morning and has glamour muscles. He also has none of the original scarring or any of the PTSD issues that Biehn's version had, and Michael Biehn is also a much better actor. I was not convinced that Courtney was Kyle Reese.And now for the worst part: like the title says, it was exactly as bad as I thought it would be. If it had been worse, it would have been enjoyably bad. If it had been better, well, that speaks for itself. But this was exactly as bad. There was a couple of funny lines here and there, and Arnold was alright in this movie, but the obvious CGI was shameful and I found myself angry that this movie was exactly what I thought it would be. The first three movies were all rated R and went all the way. This was PG-13, and clearly not fully realized.

814,dunsmorec,Arnie is BACK! Such a resurgence from the last two entries.,10,12 July 2015,"I thought it would be corny to try to force an older Arnold back into the series. My faith had been shaken by the last two outings. No corn but popcorn however, which I found myself munching on subconsciously and the bag was empty well before it was over. Always a good sign!Arnie simply rocks (within the context and setting of a very well executed overall production). I found myself at moments in the film sensing that feeling of righteous indignation one gets when a hero or ""the good"" is simply kicking ass. In order for that to work, all the ""background"" elements that are so important to a movie (winning script, direction, editing, cinematography, etc) must be there. Then, when the actors execute with equal caliber method, the movie is purely entertaining and satisfying. This movie fits that bill easily. The Terminator theme music was rolled out with sensible timing to good effect, much like the Aston Martin DB5 was in Skyfall. What Arnie brings to the Terminator (""Guardian"") so well is the sort of primal clarity that arises when the mission happens to be a noble one, and the stoic force that can be relied upon with the relentless force of will that makes even an underdog prevail. Like the kind of constant quite certitude of cowboys in the classic Westerns... As has been noted in the now growing chorus of ""ignore the critics"" recommendations, one of the masterstrokes in this movie is the right measure of humanization of the hero. Because it was done subtly and in appropriate measure, it makes the inspiration of the hero who is a hero because they have the strength and determination no matter what the odds all the more. That is possible in a context where the supporting production features are similarly well executed. This movie executes several things very well:1. Arnie is back.2. Arnie is back, but in the context of T2, not T3, whereby he is a stoic force majeure, not a one-dimensional sidekick(thanks in part to the production quality of this film). 3. The soundtrack is perfectly tuned to stir and engross the audience at the right time (that is, it ""clicks"" with the scenes and overall plot. Well done). 4. It makes the (human) characters real humans, not scripted characters. I have always believed that the talent of masterful producers and directors is to create the appropriate environment for the actors to ""rise above"". That they do is no accident, but their talents can be suppressed or ruined by the wrong overall chemistry (cf. Samuel L. Jackson in Star Wars, or Jai Courtney in A Good Day to Die Hard, etc). 5. It makes sense out of timeline complexities and ties in the earlier franchise plots very well, using T1's plot as the opening connection and overlapping in secondary characters, and T2's plot also plays large in the character development of the main 4 characters(Sarah Connor, John Connor, Kyle Reese, and the Terminator). 6. It taps into nostalgia for those familiar with the franchise (well!) without relying on it so much that it would not standalone as an excellent entry film for neophytes.Simply, for its genre, and as for the franchise, a damn well executed and highly entertaining film. I will be seeing it again in theatre for sure, and I only do that for a rare selection of films that rise above my expectations and capture my attention by engrossing me in the story and plight of the characters, which this movie did very well.",Terminator Genisys

820,cryptarch,"Finally, a new T film that does something interesting!",8,4 July 2015,"For the first time since T2, there's a terminator film that is emotionally resonant, fun, and smart enough that my brother and I are still talking it over and proposing theories. It easily thrashes T3 and T4 in terms of intelligent writing, fidelity to the spirit of T1 and T2, and style.I usually cringe at the sloppy way sequels call back to previous films. It usually feels like a cheap nostalgia tactic. This film, though, managed to call back in a way that made sense, and even furthered the plot. I managed not to be spoiled (that is, I did not watch the most recent trailer) on the big reveal, and watching it unfold was all the greater because of the echoes from the previous films.I've seen a lot of reviews accusing Genisys of being confusing, and there is some justice to that opinion, but remember, the entire franchise is one big continuity snarl. It's time-travel, folks. (Spoiler if you've never seen the first Terminator film): John Connor is born well before his father and only exists because he (John) existed to send his own father back in time. If you can swallow that, then you can handle anything Terminator: Genisys throws at you. Embrace the crazy. If my suspicions are right, if the script-writers actually thought it through, then this film is not only smart, it may well be brilliant, and the critics trashing it will be eating their words down the road. Anyhow, it's something to hope for. :) In my opinion, the film's biggest weakness was the climax. It was scattered. That's a pretty big fault, but it was not enough to ruin the film for me. Still, I'm satisfied to have a solid, re-watchable sequel to T1 and T2.I'm really wondering if the majority of professional reviewers saw a different movie than I did, or if they're just predisposed to hate it. Let them remember what the original films were, for their time, and come down off their high-horses to give this one a chance.",Terminator Genisys
821,Seanofdbush,Very disappointing,4,16 July 2015,"If you've seen the previous Terminator movies, all of which I absolutely loved, I think you'll be very disappointed with this unoriginal and derivative addition to the series. I certainly was! I felt like I was watching a pastiche of outtakes from the previous movies - only the faces had changed. I also thought that the storyline tried to be too clever by half and in the process failed completely. Maybe if I hadn't seen the same techniques used in the previous movies in the series, it might have been more interesting.The only bit of original humour was Arnie's ""smile"" - but even that joke was repeated several times - in case we had missed it the first time??? The special effects and sound effects were OK but again, not very original.All in all, a huge disappointment for me.",Terminator Genisys
822,nshahid621,**SPOILER ALERT** Short review,6,1 July 2015,"Growing up as a 90s kid, who was born in the 80s, I have longed to see a good Terminator movie. I was expecting a lot from this, especially after Terminator 3 and salvation simply didn't deliver. I will say this, Terminator Genisys is MUCH better than 3 and salvation, but doesn't come close to Terminator 2.First of all the plot is a bit weird, with so much going on, it will def. take a few viewings to full understand. The whole idea of John Conner becoming infiltrated by SkyNet is somewhat loose, I mean here you have the first 2 installments being based on the whole idea of John Conner leading the human resistance and now he becomes the bad guy? Plus Hollywood needs a few lessons on physics 101, that scene from the Golden Gate bridge? With so many tosses and turns, yet not one scrape on Sarah Conner or Reese? Please give me a break.The way Terminator 2 finished was much more appealing than this. It does seem another Terminator installment will happen because at the end Skynet is alive and well. That said, Terminator 2 was and is probably the best of the installments.Def go watch it, but this is nothing more than a one time watch. I gave it a 6/10 because Arnold was classic as always. Wish they choose someone else for Reese and Sarah Connor, and of course John Connor, they simply don't look the part.",Terminator Genisys

824,rivcogent,Terminator Genisys is an incredible movie. I can explain.,9,5 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys is the Terminator movie all true fans have been waiting for. It pays homage to the original two movies in many ways, including film style and including movie specific clips (for example, Kyle Reese's behavior to choosing clothes in the clothing store from the first Terminator). Terminator Genisys also works to eliminate the crap story lines introduced by the 3rd and fourth installment (especially salvation, which we can all agree was an absolute abomination of a movie). What I find unfair about most comments on this movie are that some of the reviewers, who have also historically placed good comments about Xmen: days of future past, have negatively reviewed the concept proposed in this movie. Although it is rehashed, it was done well and, in my opinion, better than the Xmen film.I've also corrected many of the assumed ""plot holes"" with regards to this film.Terminator Genisys may only be PG-13, but it has enough action in it to keep any action movie guy happy. It's plot centers around returning back in time to undo the existing time line from the previous movies. An issue many people have complained about starts from the idea that the characters are able to remember facts about a future time line that no longer exists. With the time-paradox, there are no defined characteristics that effectively prove that existing matter cannot retain information that was otherwise deleted due to time travel. Hence, there is no science, yet, to prove that a time traveler that experiences a change in the past cannot remember the original time line while time traveling. I hope future science can validate or invalidate this, however since this does not exist we cannot apply theories of how this should work as fact.Let's return to why Terminator Genisys is so great:1.) It retains the humor introduced in terminator 2 2.) It manages to create another bond between the terminator and his protected subject that, in my opinion, works better than his previous relationship with John Conner. 3.) It includes action scenes that were very well thought out, despite the fact that some scenes have flaws in logic. However, the movie observer cannot assume the subject in the movie has the same knowledge as the observer. 4.) It manages to keep the movie goer believing that Sarah Conner is a bad ass. Emilia Clarke does a great job picking up where Linda Hamilton left off. 5.) It brings back the feeling that the terminators aren't necessarily a program defined computer, but also a computer that is not aware that it can learn, have emotions, and more. 6.) Despite a huge spoiler presented by the commercials, this plot change is still a nice twist and welcome to the franchise (in my opinion). 7.) Arnold Schwarzenegger somehow managed to play a machine better than he ever did before. I'm having a hard time determining whether or not this character is better than the machine in T2.KIND OF A SPOILER BUT NOT REALLY A SPOILER:8.) It returns to a fun story line idea, introduced in T2, where eventually Sarah Conner finds the terminator to be the perfect father for John Conner. In this movie, the terminator really IS the perfect father for Sarah Conner.",Terminator Genisys
825,lquessenberry,Forget the Critics,9,2 July 2015,"I may be one of the flock, but I am a big fan of the Terminator franchise. This movie was appropriately delivered to fans of the franchise more than the prior 2 sequels. Arnold was Arnold and genuinely looked like he was having fun with the role. The story to me was pretty well written and despite lots of turns along the way, was engaging. There was plenty of comic relief. The battle scenes play homage to the aesthetic and look of the future wars in the 1st two movies.Emilia Clarke did a pretty good job of playing Sarah Connor although she might have been a little softer looking than Linda Hamilton, I think the justification of the plot makes you understand a little more of how and why she is the way she is.I'll tell you what they didn't do in this film. They didn't go and screw up the source material like the Star Trek reboots have. This story plays out a different scenario but the characters both old and new are familiar and this movie was done very well with respect to the source materials. If you are a fan of the franchise, you'll feel like you are getting more of what you might have had to imagine way back in the 1984 film. You'll enjoy it. Any fan of T1 and T2 should go and see this and add it to your library.",Terminator Genisys
826,CelestialCatnip,Strong Enough to Stand Up to the First Two Movies,8,15 August 2015,"OK, so ""Terminator Genisys"" wasn't as good as ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" but it was still damn good. You have to have seen the first two movies in order to appreciate the characters, the plot, and even the lines spoken by the characters. Clearly, the people who say this movie was stupid didn't bother to watch the originals, and only went to see it because Daenerys Targaryen and Doctor Who was in it. You've cheated yourself out of an enjoyable film. My only complaint is I believe it would have been amazing if they would've been able to get ALL the original actors to resume their roles (Jason Patrick, Bill Paxton, Christian Bale), but it's understandable why they couldn't.",Terminator Genisys
827,ygreko,Regret spending $.5 for this in VOD,1,21 March 2021,"This movie is nothing but boring, no sense dialogues, and some computer animated no sense scenes. I couldn't watch it entirely on Sunday afternoon with my family. Just turned it off. Don't even try to watch this.",Terminator Genisys
828,kory75,I could feel as kid again.,10,31 July 2015,"It is fun from beginning to the end. I had as much fun watching Terminator Genesys as I had Terminator 2. I could feel as kid again. It respects James Cameron's original terminator movies, and adds a new layer to it, which made the story even cooler.The chemistry between actors were great. I liked a lot how the old terminator model learn and developed some emotions. Arnold were great, Emilia as new Sara Connor were awesome choice. I loved how O'Brian got some more role.Skynet has a face now! Only the ""doctor"" is powerful enough to play that roll. ;) Thank you Matt!",Terminator Genisys
829,jbkiv,"Fun movie, as it should be",8,3 July 2016,"It was a good fun movie. I enjoyed it very much. I loved the Terminator franchise. Some more than others. I think they cast this one very well. Emilla Clark did a great job as Sarah. And Jai Courtney and Jason Clark was good in their respected roles. And it was great having Arnold back. What can you say, he makes it a Terminator movie. I hope they make another one with the same cast. It was the best one in the series right after T2. I loved the time travel spin. And different memory lines rising up. And they connected the dots tying it in. A nice twist to the franchise. I hope they are working on a follow up movie. There are many roads to go down now, is wide open. Most of the reviews are not that kind. But unfounded in my opinion. The story line was solid. Acting was good. And Arnold was back. It is just fun and well written chapter in the Terminator saga.",Terminator Genisys
830,The-Road-Warrior-96,Fans will be disappointed.,1,1 July 2015,"For a long time I have been observing the advertising for this film, as being a huge fan of the first two I was hopeful that it could deliver a similar quality. The marketing gave me little hope, as the film appeared to be an unbearable piece of *beep* However before leaving today I watched an interview on YouTube with James Cameron, where he assured fans that it did the franchise justice and was in his mind the third film. This gave me some hope that it may be good, and if it actually turned out well then I would suggest that the marketing team should be fired. However, unfortunately it would appear James Cameron was just there for the paycheque. Whilst this film isn't completely useless like Terminator Salvation and sports more interesting ideas than Terminator 3, it ultimately falls short due to generic and forgetting action sequences, a confusing story, a poor cast, and rushed editing. The story is far too confusing for me to adequately be able to sum up briefly without providing too many spoilers, so I'll simplify it as best as I can. In an alternate timeline the T- 800 raises Sarah Connor so she is prepared when Kyle Reese arrives so that they may stop judgment day, however they face adversity with a robot version of John Connor who has been infiltrated by Skynet. The alternate timeline is very confusing and poorly explained, however by the end I felt I had a decent grasp of what they were going for. Unfortunately it wound up being quite similar to Terminator 2 in the way they were again trying to prevent judgment day, which was disappointing given the possibilities of an alternate timeline, however this still offered more than the last two Terminator films combined. The cast is mixed, however everyone I felt were well cast were either drastically underused or just given nothing to work with. Jason Clarke as John Connor is in my opinion the best actor for the role out of all the Terminator films, and he also played the evil cyborg effectively. However he was given few moments to shine, and wound up being quite forgettable. JK Simmons was also very underused, and was very good when on screen. If you got excited when you heard Matt Smith was cast, don't get your hopes up as it is a glorified cameo. The problems really come from Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor and Jai Courtney as Kyle Reece. I don't know who Jai Courtney has slept with to keep getting major roles when he is obviously an incompetent actor, but he is certainly no Michael Biehn. Emilia Clarke is clearly just there as eye candy (which she admittedly succeeds at) but fails to embody the characteristics that defined Linda Hamilton's interpretation of the character, which was flawless in my humble opinion. She ultimately just seems too ""Hollywood"" and lacks either the strength and grit of Linda Hamilton from the second Terminator film nor her determination from the first film. She is just too ""cutesy"". Emilia Clarke is not a particularly good actress either, so her presence is quite negative unfortunately. Arnold Schwarzenegger is fine, neither igniting the film nor harming it. The action sequences are plentiful but none are as memorable as the terrifying police station shootout and the suspenseful finale from the first film nor the thrilling car chase and all out finale of Terminator 2. They are incredibly generic, and even the opening Arnold vs Arnold fight falls short, which should have been one of the most memorable moments from the film. The trailers showed glimpses of the action, but most of the sequences shown in the trailers aren't that much more extensive in the film yet are still the best parts from an action perspective, which for a Terminator film is simply unacceptable. The film also lacks the intensity and grounded nature of the original films. If you go in expecting a forgettable and quick paced action film you will likely be satisfied, however anyone expecting anything more will be sorely disappointed.",Terminator Genisys
831,benoitman,Good effort,9,26 May 2016,"Like all the time-travelling movies (back to the future, 12 monkeys, etc...) there is always a point when you find inconsistencies. But that said, one should admit that the scenario really tries to explain things. It takes so well in to account the elements of the T1 scenario that I don't consider that a reboot. The same way as Back to the future 2 and 3 are not reboots, but they just enrich the story of the previous movie. Really a nice effort to keep the whole story credible, at least in the present time. Regarding the future and who sends who... it's much more disputable. Probably some elements were kept for the 2 next movies initially planned.",Terminator Genisys
832,smax18013,"Great Twist, But Way Too Hollywood For Me",8,29 December 2016,"I personally have to say I actually find ""Terminator Genisys"" to be a decent film. It surely isn't a ""Terminator: Judgement Day"" but it is unique in its own right. That being said, the stunts and the action in this film is too much. I love violent actions scenes as much as the next person, however, there is a limit. The widely known scene of the school bus flipping high and far across the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco is just a little too much for me. That particular scene just made me lose my love for it, even though I loved the ""alternate timeline"" scenario. Some will say that is downright stupid, but I find it unique and interesting. I won't even comment on Jai Courtney or Emilia Clarke in the roles of Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor, but I will point out that Arnold Schwarzenegger does a fantastic job, considering his age. And, let's be real, it's Arnie. Now I know I'm fighting a demographic, and many would argue that the film is garbage, I say otherwise. As I said, the film is thought- provoking in terms of story, but the Hollywood Magic is just too much. I've seen more convincing car chases in Marvel movies than this. It's just too much, I'm sorry.",Terminator Genisys
833,cocacolakid1,Surprisingly Good!,8,3 July 2015,"Arnold manages to pull off an old Terminator. I really enjoyed the movie, but they should have found someone else to play Sarah Conner. Linda Hamilton left some very big boots to fill, Emilia does a decent job but doesn't look right for the part, she doesn't look '80s at all, and she should be a lot more buff, especially considering how her part has changed from the original. The effects looked good. nothing ground breaking, but well done. Overall a good movie, saw it in IMAX 3D. The 3D was nothing special, (and Hollywood should stop releasing every movie in a 3D version unless in was shot in 3D and looks really spectacular.), but everything looked crisp and the sound rocked. Definitely will pick up on Blu-ray.",Terminator Genisys
834,wes_dance,Not the Terminator you are looking for...,1,15 August 2015,"Having watched Terminator at age in the 80'sand the T2 in the 90's, there was a certain amount of class to the movies. Everything from artistic design, to musical score, to directing, to effects were superb; hell, even Arnie's acting as an unstoppable killer was scary. These were visceral films with great, realised and complex concepts that won the heart of film goers. I'm sorry..Terminator Genisys is in a long line of movies that parasitically absorb all that was good of the original's just to cash in on old glories to create new money. This is on par as one of the most stupidest and terrible movies I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, the way the movie attempts to constantly make references to T1 and T2 to validate itself (in the same way as Jurassic World before it) is just tragic. The only decent thing is the CGI - with some pretty nifty scenes - however, these again are soured by the way they are trying to remind the audience how great the effects were in T2. Poor, very poor film. A description of this film could be: 'Terminator and terminator 2 by James Cameron were fantastic, we know this they'll never be bettered - watch as we throw together a completely nonsensical script that constantly and nonsensically references the first two movies just to remind you of how great they were, so you don't notice how completely awful this film truly is.'Sorry, but if you enjoyed this, you're helping send cinema down the pan.",Terminator Genisys
835,doug-j-eves,"Vomit inducing, muck fest",1,3 July 2015,"I would rather have screens surgically implanted into my eyelids with a continuous loop of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines playing for the rest of time and human existence, than have to sit through this garbage, ham-fisted, Hollywood rubbish up that is Terminator Genysis. There is no shame in making garbage film anymore. This movie marks the official death of the American blockbuster and highlights the fact that Hollywood model of film making needs to end with a bloody revolution. Summing up this film I'll quote a great man: ""no where in you incoherent rambling did you come close to an original thought. Everyone is no dumber from hearing your answer. I award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul"". If I could give this film 0 stars I would but seeing as I can only give it 1, one it is.",Terminator Genisys
836,xboxgamer98,Terminator Genyshite,4,9 July 2015,"I am a film student in the UK I am 17 and I have watched every single Terminator movie to date I loved the first two actually really like the third one but despised the forth one. I went into this one with low expectations after not liking the trailers at all but I wanted to give it a shot so despite all the bad reviews and bad trailers I went and saw this film and now I can report back and say that this movie is actually worse than I thought it would be and I do not feel at all good about saying that. First of all I want to say that a lot of people are not going to understand the story one bit, fortunately enough I was able to understand but my other three friends I went with where completely baffled and the general reaction is that the story is confusing. Secondly the action is just poor I cannot remember anything remotely good about the action in this film apart from maybe one scene that is already in the trailer so there you go you have saw the movie already wooooo. Thirdly the best parts of the film are when Arnie is on screen now you are probably thinking that is a good thing, no not really unfortunately because he is now a parody of himself you laugh every time he is on screen but about half way through it starts to get tiresome and ridiculous the light hearted moments we got from T2 are replaced with these parody moments that maybe ruin his character. The actors where fine in this film nothing special unfortunately they worked with what they had and with it being bad writing what they had was not good.Finally once you get to the end of the film you will realise what they have done to the franchise I am not going to say anything about it as it might spoil it but it is the biggest sin of the whole film.Overall the action was boring and not memorable it was funny at parts but gets tiresome. Please just save your money and wait for Ant-man or something better to come out please do not waste your money on this film.",Terminator Genisys

It's a twist which you'll later find out.But no! you know who he is because you just watched the full trailer.Which describes the whole plot in like 2 minutes.They tried adding a slight humor to the mix.It didn't work out like those typical marvel movies.And tbh Jai Courtney's acting was bad too.All in all not a good movie to go to the theater to but definitely torrent able!",Terminator Genisys

It will ruin the entire franchise forever for you. No chemistry, recycling everything that worked before. Such lazy rubbish, despite obviously well done special effects. Horrendous beta male, despite being muscle bound in the form of the new Reece.If a film could be a face palm. This is it.

841,simon-higgins2,Lost in Time...,5,6 July 2015,"First things first – I am a big fan of the first 2 terminator films. Even though both were before my time, they are exhilarating to watch – relentless, fast paced action, great characters, memorable one liners that don't seem cheesy, and a plot that involves a clever and thought provoking time travel concept. Terminator Genisys seems to want to replicate all of these things, however only partially succeeds in a couple of areas, whereas falls well short in others.The film starts with its best sequence, starting in the future and essentially reliving the moments before the first Terminator. However when Kyle Reese makes his journey into the past, things do not go to plan, and the timeline he is in is no longer the one he was told about. Sound confusing? Sadly for this film it is only just beginning, as this is where the film really starts to lose its way. The next 30 minutes is seemingly spent discussing time travel, timelines, nexus points and all sorts of mumbo jumbo until the viewer is so confused as to what is happening that it distracts from what is happening in the film itself, which happens to be a number of good and enjoyable action set pieces .The films second and third acts then take us to the year 2017 (for no obvious reason) where Kyle and Sarah have to stop Skynet from going live, and standing in their way is a familiar foe who, if they hadn't given it away in the trailers, would have been more of a worthy villain. Cue lots of explosions, cheesy one liners and, yes you guessed it, confusing time travel discussions.There were elements of the film to enjoy – I felt the action overall was good, it was great to see Arnie back in his title role, and some of the jokes involving Arnie's ""Pops"" character were good fun. Emelia Clarke and Jai Courtney did OK, although their romance felt very forced and the chemistry on screen was equal to that of a pine cone. There were supporting characters that did show promise (JK Simmons a perfect example) however they were given limited screen time and as a consequence felt rushed and un fulfilled.I left the theatre with my girlfriend (never seen a Terminator film) who claimed she liked the movie – ""it was great fun"" she said. After some follow up questioning I realised she had no real clue what was going on, but enjoyed the overall ride. I think this sums up the film for me – ignoring the confusing time travel babble it's an enjoyable popcorn flick of the Michael Bay variety. Pay attention to every word, and it will be a rather frustrating 2 hours.",Terminator Genisys
842,hejawol0602,Mediocre at best!,5,30 May 2016,"OK. Well, I just finished watching Terminator Genisys today. Overall, it was kind of underwhelming. It wasn't awful, but could've been so much better! But let me start off with the positives:-Arnold is still really good as the Terminator and is the best part of this movie. JK Simmons is pretty good as well.-Effects and visuals are decent-It has an intriguing plot -The design for the new Terminator is pretty cool.Now for the cons: -The action scenes are too short! While those scenes are directed and done OK, they're so short that barely leave an impression.-The other actors in the movie, while not awful, are playing their roles as if their going through the motions. They weren't convincing enough for me, though it might have been the direction they were given or they simply weren't right for the part.-Actors have no chemistry whatsoever, particularly the actors playing Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor! Not once did I buy their relationship. I also didn't buy The Terminator's (or Pops as he was called) and Sarah's father/guardian daughter relationship either. It just felt like it was shoehorned in just to get some kind of emotion.-Some parts of the movie are confusing or don't make any sense.-How can you make a movie about an apocalypse that's gonna happen such a run of the mill thing?! There's little to no sense of urgency!Overall: While not a god awful movie, it is so mediocre and it doesn't leave a huge impact on you.",Terminator Genisys
843,elias-877-447048,This movie should be experienced in theaters!,10,10 July 2015,"This movie was much more than I expected and everything that I secretly hoped it would be.The plot makes sense! The characters are very likable and the movie has a lot of humor. Terminator 2, the best movie of the franchise, had awesome action but it had lots of scenes of humor. The action scenes are eye popping and, in many occasions I jumped on my seat! :) The ending was surprising and refreshing.After the terrible disappointment that ""Mad Max"" was, I was expecting Hollywood to do more of the same. I was expecting another beloved franchise form the 80s to be mutilated, defiled and violated.What I actually got was:1) A movie packed full of awesome action. 2) Beloved characters that you actually get engaged to and want to root for. 3) Jaw dropping special effects. The young Schwarzenegger is at the very edge of breaking the ""uncanny valley"" barrier. 4) The movie had humor. I had belly laughs with the interaction between old Arnold and Sara Connor.Please, do not wait to watch this movie on your TV. This is a movie that should be experienced in theaters.What are you waiting for?? The review is over. Go! Go buy your tickets! :)",Terminator Genisys

845,pete-marchetto,What's with all the duff reviews?,7,17 April 2017,"Occasionally - just occasionally - I depart from my usual bill of film fare and head for the bubblegum shop. So it was I decided to overindulge and watch the entire Terminator series of films in one horrendous and unhealthy blow-out.I well-enough enjoyed the offerings prior to Genisys, but felt things were flagging by the time I got here. When I read the reviews of Genisys, I was tempted to call it a day without watching it, but for once my completist obsession paid off.To my mind, Genisys is the best offering of the lot. Without any spoilers to give away a well-crafted plot it's difficult to praise the film to the level it deserves, but suffice to say I can understand why Cameron was one of the few who rated it highly for all the critical knockbacks. It's not only a worthy successor to his first Terminator offering, but also plays with its themes so beautifully that it's clearly a labour of love as much as of craft.The humour is dark, but gently amusing. An ageing Schwarzenegger - his age neatly built into the plot - is nicknamed 'Pops' by his charge, and throughout the film there's the sense that the film plays with what's preceded it while never degenerating into parody or homage. The action is played a little down from some of the excesses of earlier offerings - let's face it, it would be hard to play it up - but the action is there in abundance just the same along with the tension that comes with it. What it makes way for in being somewhat played down is a genuine humanisation of the characters. I actually gave a damn about the strange and complex relationships that came into play and, for the most part, the scripting allowed for them to develop well and realistically.Sure, I'm not your classic Terminator fan, but in writing this review I do so as someone who knows what anyone would have got out of what preceded Genisys. I got it myself. How on earth those who saw Genisys can't see it as a worthy successor is beyond me. To my mind it's spot-on.One recommendation. Do it my way. Watch the entire series in a sitting... or, at least, several sittings over a few days. If you can't be bothered doing that, at least watch the original Terminator once more before watching this one. That film fresh in your mind, you'll get a great deal more out of Genisys. But either way, don't write it off for carping reviews. Check it out, and decide for yourself.",Terminator Genisys
846,paul1622,Holy Nostalgia Batman,5,3 July 2015,"There are multiple ways of seeing this movie. If you haven't seen the original movies, this works as a fun action movie. If you have seen the old movies, then this is a fairly bad film. The movie relies so much on nostalgia from the first movies and drawing old fans back into the theaters. When Arnold gives the thumbs up, when he says ""I'll be back"" and when Sarah Connor says ""Come with me if you want to live,"" you are simply annoyed and groan. They use the liquid terminator for 5 minutes and his character just disappears. They use the Terminator (Arnold) as the comic relief and that is simply unforgivable. The fact that they take one of the most bad ass character and give him horrible jokes in a dreadful thought. The trailer completely ruined the John Connor twist as well as all of the cool action moments in the film. By the end, they had pretended to kill of John Connor and the Terminator about 10 times. By that time, it seemed like the screenwriters were trying to cram whatever they could into the movie to give it a solid running time. Topped off with the horrible performance from Jai Courtney. As per usual, he brings a boring performance to the almost well written role. Though there were some silver linings. Emilia Clarke and J.K. Simmons (though his character was pointless) gave some solid performances. The action was cool and the graphics were mind blowing. Overall, the movie would work as a standalone action movies of none of the previous movies had existed. But they did, and the filmmakers tried to use the amazing elements of those movies to make this good and it did not work.",Terminator Genisys
847,jhanssen-52-258249,A brilliant affectionate parody,2,8 November 2015,"I must say, I do agree with a lot of the reviews of this films, but mostly the ones who didn't like it very much, but I disagree with their conclusion. This is a very well done 'affectionate' parody of the Terminator series. Nad by that I mean it is by no means a 'spoof', as it stays very true to the originals (even adding points from 3 and 4, which many people believe to be 'not canon'), while still making fun of things that can be made fun of. Some of the comedy, (casting a Time Lord as Skynet/Genisys, that was not an accident), a bus pole vault had me actually laughing out loud (seriously it flies maybe 100 feet into the air?) and the constant jokes about Kyle and Sarah having to 'create' John makes a hilarious brick joke. As for the more serious parts, well, they are mostly very quick flashbacks, and doesn't affect the story much. The Nuclear holocaust has no where near the impact it had in Judgment Day or even T3, and is not even as well made as in T2. Most plot holes could be side effects of the time travel, and the existence of several time-lines colliding, and it is obvious that the screen writer was inspired by films like Back to the Future. As for other negative things, the effects are typical modern day CGI for the most parts, so normal physics mostly doesn't really apply (some metal breaks on impact, some just stretches etc. magnets are magical etc.), and the difference in strength between different generations of Terminators is only plot driven, meaning that any fight scene gets a bit boring,as the outcome is given. I do not understand how they could possibly make a sequel to this though. There is really nothing more they can do to the franchise after this. Without going into any spoilers, this is the definite Terminator film, unless Skynet wants to travel even further back in time, from somewhere even further into the future. Because there is no way any of the events previously seen in the franchise can possible happen again without totally disregarding this film. (which, tbh would not be the first time for the franchise, but , come on) I gave it a 6 out of 10 because I laughed my ass off, but I have to detract some for half decent acting, add some for JK Simmons character, then detract some for not using that character more, then add some for Arnold, then detract some for effects , well, you get the point. It's fun, and entertaining, and it is even more fun if you are intelligent without having 'Terminator OCD', and you like time travel paradoxes.",Terminator Genisys
848,woodbruce1,Felt like I'd seen it before,5,19 August 2016,"A solid 5 out of 10. I don't think I've ever given a middling rating, but somehow this gets one. Not quite bad enough to stop watching, not good enough to get a high rating.Pros:* It has Arnie in it. * It has very high production values and special effects. * It's very polished. * It sort of resonates with the previous Terminator films in a way that conjures up nostalgia for them.Cons: * The girl is terribly annoying and unlikable. Bratty rather than tough. Linda Hamilton had a captivating profundity. I could imagine this actress at a Denny's getting snappy with the waitress because her eggs are under-cooked. * The time-travel plot is hopelessly tangled. I guess when you make enough time travel sequels you are going to end up with spaghetti but I feel like they could have played it down rather than pretending that what they said made sense. * It wasn't so much that it was bad, but rather you felt like you'd already seen it. It was like cut up all the previous terminators and pick out 2 hours of footage and you get this one. So kind of likable, but the feeling that I was re-watching.Oh well. Hum ho.",Terminator Genisys
849,laurawildish,"Great Movie, could this be the best movie of the Year?",10,21 July 2015,"This is the first time I have seen a movie at the Cinema 3 times and I am looking for an excuse to see it again. Plenty of action right from the start (unlike the slow-motion Ant-Man). With some handy time travelling to move the story along.So often with re-boots like this it is like seeing the same film as the original but with different actors in the leads. But NOT HERE, this is a real re-imaging of the franchise and I am so hopping that the rumors I have read are true and they will be making another two. Although the rights will revert back to James Cameron in 2019 (well that is what I have read). With his endorsement of the film (sky movie shorts) perhaps even if he does own the rights he might let them make another film I for one certainly hope so.",Terminator Genisys
850,AlexKirkby,It is Nice To See You,9,4 July 2015,"First I am going to say this Terminator Genisys is by far one of the best action movies of this year.Before I talk about the film I'm going to talk a bit about the previous films in the series. 1984s Terminator was a great and fantastic film that opened the door to time travel, survival and Action. The sequel hit the screens in 1991 and like very little sequels it was better then the previous one and was by far the best action movie of the 90s and is still classed as one of the best action movies ever made. Terminator 3 hit the screens in 2003 and many people say when the third film comes around all bets are off I have seen lose of movies and this is not true at all in fact the third film in the series gives more of the same and I guess I am one of the only people that really liked Terminator 3 and in my opinion it one of the best action movies that were made that year. Terminator Salvation hit the screens In 2009 and I will say this the people that made the film took a big chance at doing a film without Arnold but they did deliver a action movie that gave a look at the future that had only been talked about and seen on and off in the previous 3 movies and TV series, it was no top film or better then the other films in the series but it was a good action movie.Terminator Genisys is the brand new look at the series and I am going to talk bit by bit. First bit I am going to talk about is the cast, the cast is fantastic in this film it is great to see Arnold Schwarzenegger back as the T-800 we all know and love this is his series and no terminator film is complete without Arnold. I also liked Jason Clarke as John Connor OK I will say this when I heard about this film last year I did hope that Christian Bale would replace the role but after watching the film I did come to like Clarke as John Connor. The next one is Emilia Clarke, I have been watching Game Of Thones for quite a while now and I wouldn't pick anyone else to play the new Sarah Connor she played her just as good as Linda Hamilton. Emilia Clarke is a fantastic a sexy lady and she fitted Sarah Connor perfectly and when the nude scene came around she is no stranger and I will say it is a shame this film isn't a 15 but Game Of Thones Offers a lot. The next cast member is Jai Courtney who in my opinion played a really good Kyle Reese and I will be looking forward to seeing him in future instalments. J.K. Simmons played his role really well but I couldn't really see why he was in the film but who cares he offered a good performance. The last 2 roles are Matt Smith and Byung Hun Lee, both these roles were very small but they were played very well. Matt Smith surprised me as the evil Skynet and I will say it is a shame it his role was so small and from what the end credit scene showed Matt Smith will be around for the next movie and I hope he has a bigger part. Byung Hun Lee played a very good T1000 but the role was to dame small what I would of liked is if T1000 was in most of the movie like he formed and alliance with the evil T3000 and went after Sarah, Kyle and T800 or John Connor had to flight both Arnold and the T1000 just because the T1000 saw John as a villain and T1000 destroys all people in his way ever if they have the same gale but you can't have everything you want. The story is very good and the plot is not one bit hard to follow it does change a lot of things and gives us a lot of questions to be asked for the future. The film gives us a great look at the future of the war with the Terminators and they have copied the begin of 1984 film really well. The CGI is fantastic and offers some of the best special effects ever. Now this film did offer a lot of things that we love to see. The first is Old Aronld fighting Young Aronld now that is just brilliant. The time machine that was talked about in the past film a lot, the T1000 re activating the dead T800 I thought that was brilliant, Sarah Connor being a sexy badass, John Connor and Matt Smith being the villains, Arnold Schwarzeneggers T800 upgrading to a T1000 I always like the underdog story with the weaker and less advanced then the villain but now he is a T1000 I will like to see what the villains have install for him in the future. The last thing I really liked was the hummer and action was fantastic. This film is one of the best action films of this year and I can't wait for the sequel I give this film a 9/10.",Terminator Genisys
851,omerd-153-659369,"Finally, a decent sequel, much better than I expected!!",9,6 July 2015,"OK, what is wrong with you people? This was very good movie, why so bad reviews? Nobody expected it to be like Judgment day, but this is still decent movie... Action, clever plot, humor (Arnie was hilarious), it follows the old story (from first two sequels), probably the best 3D that I ever watched... what can you expect more? OK, the villain, maybe, could be a little bit better, time travel is complicated (when it is not), but still, no movie is perfect. It was very hard to make a new kind of terminator, that will be superior to T-1000, but I think they made it.

852,gwarren16,Finally he's back.,8,2 July 2015,"Amid the various reviews for this title have been nothing but criticisms about sluggish storytelling and lack of direction, indicating this movie hasn't justified its hefty budget. However, I strongly disagree and believe this is the long-awaited blockbuster this series has needed since the release of the disastrous and seemingly pointless Terminator Salvation in 2009. This exciting entry into the series sees Arnold Schwarzenegger reprise his role as the iconic and legendary T800. Terminator Genisys details the story of Kyle Reese, a fighter in the human Resistance in the ongoing war against Skynet. He is sent back to the year 1984, echoing the original movie, only to find all is not as it seems and he finds himself fighting alongside Sarah Connor and the T800 in a changed time frame, in order to save humanity. The highlights of this movie are its narrative making it quite easy to understand an otherwise complicated storyline, as well as its action scenes and the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger to the pack. This ranks higher than both Salvation and T3: Rise of the Machines however it lags behind James Cameron's masterpieces, the first 2 movies, Terminator and T2:Judgement Day. However, I have thoroughly enjoyed the movie I have eagerly waited 6 long years for.",Terminator Genisys
853,tejasbabu-babu22,"Wow, Awesome, i still don't understand why its that underrated,",10,1 July 2015,"I am a huge Terminator fan. Terminator 2 is my favorite movie ever, and I find it to be the best movie ever made.So yeah, this review is biased, but not to an extreme degree.Terminator Genisys is an excellent movie for Terminator fans. It's for the fans. It's the Terminator sequel we deserve. I'm one of those who liked Terminator 3, but Genisys is definitely more in tune with Camerons original two.If you are not a fan, though. First off, why are you not a fan? Either you are too young, or you.. well, what the hell's wrong with you!? (Kidding...A little bit) Anyway, if you are not a fan this is still an entertaining action movie. It looks really good, the effects are pretty much top notch, the action is entertaining, the parts that are supposed to be are exciting, the acting is mostly solid. Some reviews I've seen say it's devoid of humor, but I disagree. There are small jokes sprinkled pretty evenly around.But for the fans.. Oh my. This is so in tune with Camerons originals! I think the only one who could have made this any better is Cameron himself. Of course, it would have been a much better movie-experience if the trailers hadn't spoiled so much, but whaddayagonnado!? When there's a trailer for a new Terminator-movie, I'm gonna see that trailer. But even if the trailers spoiled a lot, I won't. I will say this though. There are a lot of nods, references, and direct connections to Camerons originals here. You will recognize plenty of stuff. Some big, some smaller. Sound effects, visual stuff, it is very true to Camerons vision. Very nice. And the song, oh, just pierces my heart!I am also happy to say that they have brought back some of the more emotional concepts that we loved from T2, and that was sorely missing from T3. Not to the same extent as in T2, but still, a lot better than the two previous entries.Funny thing is that almost none of the main actors are American, haha. Austria, Australia, England, Korea representin'! Anyhow, the actors are all good. I'm not super loving Jay Courtney, but he did alright. Emilia, Jason, Byung-hun - all real good. Seeing Arnold again, damn! He is just great. Just seeing his name at the beginning, I almost teared up! The fact that it's PG13 didn't bother me much either. Yeah the blood was awesome in T2, but it's alright that we don't get it here. As for the nudity, it wouldn't have hurt us, but hey, partial nudity is alright too. Anyway the rating doesn't take anything away, there's still plenty of violence. It is just fantastic to see Terminator-stuff made with 2015-technology. Those endoskeletons.. Awesome! And a certain scene partially lifted from a certain movie, damn! So cool to see.I haven't got much bad to say, some of the dialogue and one-liners could have been a tad better, a couple of the jokes are a little overused, but it's mostly nitpicking I think. I can honestly say, as a life long (I saw T2 the first time when I was really little) Terminator-fan, I enjoyed the hell out of this. Already looking forward to seeing it again. It was at times perfect. Very entertaining.Now go see it people, so it makes good in them boxoffices. I want more of these!",Terminator Genisys
854,Santiago97,My Childhood has been ruined...again,1,25 June 2015,"Man, if you care about your childhood favorite movies, every time there's a new installment there's a great hype about it, but if George Lucas teach us something from the Phantom Menace, it's that sometimes is better for fans to leave a franchise rest in peace (even if the producers disagree). If you still hold a resentment against Lucas for that ""NOOOO!"" at the end of ""Revenge of the Sith"", please, don't watch Terminator: Genesys. It's a BIG F*** YOU to T1 and T2. It, literally,aims to ""rebuild the franchise"" at it's core, making a move that only Skynet would dare to do, and that is to ""erase"" the past: T1 happened in some sort of twist, weird, way, but T2 is forgotten forever. ""Hasta la vista, Baby"" never happened (and never will). In the movie, each character acts as if they had already watch the whole saga and said like: ""Now, were are doing it our way..."". They know like each fun fact from T1 and T2, in some point, i was really expecting anything: Marty Mcfly making a cameo? it was a high possibility.It started as Mad Max: Fury Road, and ended like San Andreas, and not only because they are settled in San Francisco.There are some cool actions scenes (and few hardly emotional ones), but everything is mainly a remake of the best scenes in T1 and T2, so Arnold can come up with it's iconic one-liners. But, there are two scenes involving music, that really, REALLY, messed up with the whole Terminator essence that James Cameron wanted. Example: there's a scene that looks like a musical (or any STOMP show), and i'm not kidding.But, the BIGGEST, the WACKIEST thing they did to the WHOLE TERMINATOR FRANCHISE is...renaming the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) as: POPS. Again, i'm not kidding: no more T-800, ""It's Pops, kids, it's Pops..."". So, if this is you're first Terminator movie, you'll know from here on the T-800 as Pops, no as ""The Terminator"". It really, broke my childhood into pieces look at what James Cameron did and what this monsters had done (and refuse to stop). Why ""Pops"", Why that silly name? WHYYYY???The Terminator saga is like Skynet, it refuses to die...Each new movie is damaging more our childhood and the saga as a whole. And why? BECAUSE TERMINATOR WAS SUPPOSED TO END IN T2. Not to continue forever.Maybe, as a stand alone film, it can hold up, but, knowing what T1 and T2 are and achieve (specially if you're a fan), it really is a brand new: ""RIGHT IN THE CHILDHOOD"".Forgive them, James Cameron, the don't know what they are doing..Forgive them.",Terminator Genisys

856,laurisalminen,Fun Terminator movie with high production values,8,29 June 2015,"Saw this yesterday with a good friend. I have always loved the Cameron Terminators. Original ideas with great artistry and delivery. I could never understand, why they let the series dive so deep with parts 3 & 4. If you have a universe this big with great ground work laid down in part 1 & 2... Now to the review. I enjoyed this film very much. I didn't have any anticipations before the viewing. Maybe I was a bit afraid because the trailers and TV spots didn't spark any excitement. Also PG-13 or K-12 here in Finland for Terminator... But my worries faded as the movie went along. Arnie, Emilia and Jason gave their best. Never liked Jai but even he did OK job in this movie. The effects were good. I admit there is lots of CGI and I like practical effects more but I can forgive some of it in this movie. ""Young Arnold"" has to be the best effect I have seen in cinema. Alan Taylor did a good job keeping things moving along. The best part of the movie is Arnold. He was born to play this character. Expendables movies have not given him anything to do but this movie (along with Maggie) really shows that his acting skills have improved along the way. Some of the gags in the movie actually made me smile or laugh and that is a tough task for a movie nowadays as I usually find the comedic parts of the movie painful and cringe-worthy. PG-13 did not bother me as there were a couple of ""familiar"" kills and some swearing. Of course it could have been bloodier and edgier but all in all I can look past the PG-13.

Don't go to the toilet, get more refreshments or anything, stay, watch and listen. If you follow this then you will have no problems for MOST of it.Yes there are some unanswered questions. But these are in the movie to lead on to a sequel, which 2 more are planned. So if you can move past this you will be fine.To sum up, James Cameron was right when he said we will love it. You will. This movie has it all in, it has the love story between kyle and Sarah, it has a father-daughter relationship between 'pops' and Sarah Connor, and it has brilliant acting.

861,pietroricci,Generic and formulaic.,1,10 July 2015,"So, I went to see the movie last night and brought 6 people with me - this was opening day here in Italy, 10:30 p.m showing, theater was almost half full I'd say.SPOILERSI will have to be honest and frank and since I spent money on this thing, I have a right to be - I went in really wanting to like it and not be disappointed. I didn't like it. From beginning to end, I felt it was so generic, dull and uninspired that I thought I'd already seen it 20 times.My friends and I, and lots of people in the theater, found ourselves chatting while watching it, which is never a good sign since this is supposed to be an ""edge of your seat"" type film that's supposed to hold your attention.All of us agreed on the leads, except Arnold, being so miscast and charismaless - surprisingly, I didn't dislike Jay Courtney as much as I thought I would but I did hate Jason Clarke as John Connor. That guy was so wrong in the John Connor role: he doesn't have the physicality or the charisma to pull that role off. Emilia Clarke was just fine.I felt the plot was confusing and hard to follow for the most part.I did like the relationship between Sarah and the T-800, though I had a hard time hearing her calling it ""pops"". I did like the ""protect my Sarah"" moment - that was a bit emotional and the only moment that made you ""care"". I liked that the T-800 kept pictures and drawings of Sarah and hung them on the wall. I didn't dislike the humor as much as I thought I would for the most part but I didn't like it either - I did think that it took away the dangerous aura that a Terminator is supposed to have, though.What holds this thing together is Arnold - every time he wasn't in the scene, I couldn't wait for him to appear on screen even though I knew it'd be him being made out to be some kind of goofy character. He's the best thing about the movie, though. I always love seeing Arnold on the big, silver screen.There's nothing memorable about this film - you don't really feel as if anything's at stake and it just feels very generic, like 100 other summer blockbusters. I'm actually wondering how some people seem to be liking it but hey, different strokes for different folks and that's absolutely OK.I felt this was as generic and formulaic as they come. I can't remember a single scene that stuck out. I felt as if nothing was at stake through it.Movies nowadays don't swing for the fences anymore - they're made by committees which make sure to make them as neutral and comfortable as they can for as large and audience as they can, taking all of the film's edges away - problem is when you try to please everybody you end up pleasing nobody.That's what's so wrong with studios nowadays and that's why we keep getting these generic, formulaic blockbusters you don't remember anything about as soon as the end credits start rolling.It's no wonder that opinionated and talented filmmakers, for the most part, are not working for big studios today.Funnily, when I went to see MAGGIE, which is thought of as this slow-burning, boring film, no one chatted throughout it - on the contrary, everyone was really into it and taken with the story and the emotions it gave off, at least as far as I could tell.This is just my personal opinion on the film. I'll be seeing it a second time on Saturday and bringing with me 5 other people. I hope I'll like it at least a bit more the second time around. But after that, I won't be seeing it anymore times at the theater.As of now, this is a 4 out of 10 for me.",Terminator Genisys

I have watched T2 over 200 times at least, so many times.Honestly this movie was as bad as Jurassic World, it was like watching Hollywood turn into Cannibals and eat themselves to survive because they are so out of ideas they are going to the ends of the earth to come out with more Garbage like Jurassic Fark, Tommorowlandcrap, culttom mission retarded 2721 , these guys are such jokes its not even funny.Sarah Connors character made me want to punch everyone in the theater for no reasons because all she does the whole time is complain and moan, damn.The pulse rifles sounded nothing like the original sounds like a toy you buy at the dollar store. This was a train-wreck beyond anything you can think off until you really see this steaming pile of rotting McDonalds burgers vomited into your mouths.",Terminator Genisys
865,jonnyg-74017,It's never as good as your first time,5,4 July 2015,"I would like to compare the Terminator films to the woman you married, okay starting with the first Terminator film, you were casually waiting at the bus stop and then a girl came and sat next to you, you were completely smitten, not even her rain soaked hair and wet clothes could detract just how lovely she looked,she had that fresh faced look, your eyes met and sparks flew, it all happened just by coincidence, you stumbled across the girl you want to spend the rest of your life with, its a moment you will never ever forget. Terminator 2, well this was your second date with the girl, you knock on her door and she answers looking a million dollars, she's wearing a figure hugging dress and hair and make up done to a tee, you have a cracking date and right there and then you know you will marry this girl, she is in your heart for good. Terminator 3, well you have been married for a few years now, your comfortable with each other, the first initial sexual chemistry is slowly diminishing but you have a connection, you sit and joke with each other on the sofa. Terminator 4, 20 years have gone by and cracks are beginning to appear in the marriage, she has changed, she's put a bit of weight on, eating to many crisps, she's not the girl you fell in love with all those years ago, she went through a mid life crisis and changed, but not for the better. Terminator 5, The mid life crisis is over, she starts eating more healthy, the joke telling is back, the marriage is back on track after nearly being derailed, the happy times are back, but as they sit there cuddling on the sofa it will never be as good as what it was the first time they met, it was something new, something completely unexpected, you were both young, vibrant and full of life, and no matter how hard you try, you will never recapture that moment when you first laid eyes on each other, its sad but true....This is my interpretation of the Terminator films, i thought 1 & 2 were truly awesome films, i even thought 3 was an excellent film but not quite on the same level as the first two, i thought 4 was complete garbage but because it was a terminator film i was happy with something rather than nothing, and 5 was okay i suppose, what drives me crazy is why cant they find anyone to write a brilliant script, they have done it before so why are they finding it so difficult now, and miscasting certain roles drove me insane as well, Kyle Reece was a hero in the first film, in this one he comes across as a complete plonker... Arnie was his usual top notch. i cant complain too much i guess, i got to watch another terminator film and when you love the whole concept i really shouldn't grumble. i still remember being 16 years old and luckily being judged to be 18 when i walked in the cinema and sat down to watch one of the best films I've ever seen....",Terminator Genisys
866,mynameiszankoku,"I Don't Care What The Critics Say, I Loved This Film!",8,4 July 2015,"As I was walking out of the theater after watching Terminator Genisys, I was really confused. It wasn't because the plot was confusing, or that the acting was so bad that I wondered how these people were ever cast. I was confused as to why there were so many negative reviews for this film. The most common complaints I have read/heard were that the plot was a confusing, hard to follow mess, and that the acting was horrible. I did not find that to be the case at all.Terminator Genisys begins with the spectacular final battle between humanity and the machines, and finally gives us the story of how the human rebels found and used Skynet's time machine. What follows first appears to be a re-telling of the first Terminator film that goes sideways after all the time travel shenanigans that have been occurring since the first film has since caused everything to turn on its head. Instead of a reboot of The Terminator, we get a complete re-writing of history, and of course; the future. This alone sets up tremendous possibilities for this film and any future films.What Terminator Genisys does is reset a narrative that was going nowhere and allows the series to go into new directions. Let's be honest with ourselves here; none of the Terminator movies, even T2, were perfect movies. Besides the ridiculous premise of machines made to mimic humans going back in time to kill people before they can birth or grow up to be the future human resistance leader, each film didn't do anything all that creative with their plots. Besides Terminator Salvation, which I will try not to mention ever again; the plot always boiled down to a robot is trying to kill someone and someone else is sent from the future to stop it. There is only so much you can do with the Terminator story without it always being the same thing over and over again. I dare say without the benefit of the ground-breaking FX, T2 probably would have been less well received and knocked for its unoriginality. With Genisys we finally start to break out of the much worn narrative. They are attempting to do things different, while still holding onto the themes of the original movies. While not everything in Genisys works, we still get a very fun, engaging, and entertaining movie that in some ways is better than The Terminator and T2. The plot is a lot more straight forward than the critics would have you believe, and it does a decent job of explaining itself. As for the acting, I found at no time during the film that the actors' performances took anything away from the film. Sure, there won't be any Oscars getting passed around anytime soon, but they seem on part with the performances in previous Terminator films.After all is said and done, Terminator Genisys did its job. I was entertained, engaged, and excited about the possibilities it opened up. It felt fresh and gave a floundering franchise a much need jolt of energy.I would suggest you ignore the critics and determine for yourself whether Genisys is a much needed and enjoyable turn for the Terminator franchise, or another nail in its coffin. I say the former in stead of the latter, but that is just my opinion. After all, I could be wrong...",Terminator Genisys
867,somelove,Well worth seeing,8,4 July 2015,"This film is very good. Don't be put off by some negative reviews. If you want a rousing action film with great special effects and a good enough storyline then go see it. Any film about time travel is full of plot holes but if you look beyond this you'll get a lot out of it. It's also good how this film references the first 3 films (especially 1 and 2)and then makes its own path. And of course it's great to see Arnie back in his iconic role, ably supported by the other actors. Admittedly the first two Terminator films are best and I would give them 10 out of 10, but in my mind this is the third best in the series, hence me giving it a very respectable 8 out of 10.",Terminator Genisys
868,wigginschris,More GOOD than BAD,9,5 July 2015,"This film completely ignores Terminator Salvation, which is fantastic.Terminator Genisys is an action packed movie from start to finish that focuses on the very phenomenon that got the Terminator to 1984 in the first place; time travel. The entire movie gives a realistic view on time travel and its complexity, offering an alternative past to which Kyle Reeves and the Terminator where sent back to. I have heard that there are two more movies to come out of this, and so their should be, as this movie failed to explained who sent a terminator back to kill Sarah Coner when she was 9, and who sent one back to save her, also when she was 9. I can see the next instalment offering us a mishmash of future and present day to give us an exciting explanation. My only criticism of the film is that Kyle Reeves and Sarah Coner fell in love within a few hours, and that previously to this Sarah changed her whole mentality after years of training to time travel to 1987 and relied on a memory (that could have been a dream) of Kyle (who she just met), where they ended up travelling to 2017 instead. Bit of a long shot, but made a good story plot regardless.",Terminator Genisys
869,caslin-75336,nowhere left to go,8,8 July 2015,"this franchise just doesn't have anywhere to go. they keep telling the same story over and over again but not as well and with diminishing results. there are some good ideas in the film, but when you fling 100 ideas at the audience, a few will stick. I actually think it's the worst film in the series, and they should tell a new story in the terminator universe instead of retelling the same story.... go back into the past to change the future. how about tell a original time travel movie and include a endo in it. Schwarzenegger is the best part of the film, although it's sad to see him age, we are all victims of time even Schwarzenegger. hopefully this wont spell the end of his returning to old franchise films. lets just hope there's original stories to come along with the nostalgia.",Terminator Genisys

Then I went to see it yesterday ! My man !!! Terminator Genisys beat it ! I was amazed at the solid scenario , the suspense , the unexpected enemies , the unexpected outcomes links! Even actors though new to the series (Jai Courtney, Emilia Clarke and Jason Clarke ) played their role very well ! Not to mention Arnold Schwarzenegger , incredible old man never quits , he is not expandable , he is necessary ! A good advise : watch it yourself , don't trust the critics who gave it unfavorable reviews, they disappointed me ! Terminator Genisys couldn't be better . See it for yourself ,special effects and actions are well served by the thrilling scenario ! Enjoy it fellows",Terminator Genisys
871,soytim-64812,It's totally awesome!!!,10,16 July 2015,"Let me say first that I don't think there is a bigger terminator fan out there then me. When I was a kid I would seriously wrap my arm in aluminium foil to make others think I WAS a terminator. I remember every line from the first 2 movies because I have seen them at least 200 times. Kind of a geek huh. Don't worry, I turned out fine btw :D I expected Terminator Genysis to be a lame movie like 3 and 4 in my opinion were. I was totally wrong and I left the cinema so happy. It was like seeing an old friend after years and find out he has not changed a bit. Just matured. The movie has everything and is so full of details which the real fan will immediately see. Kyle Reese strapping his Nikes in the mall! Arnie stepping into the time machine as skynet is faced with losing the war. Just incredible! Acting was perfect! Story was great and explained a lot. Emilia made a great Sarah. And Arnold was..what can I say..mr terminator! Well done guys! I became a fan all over again!(definitely thinking about wrapping my arm as I go to the mall today) :p thanks so much",Terminator Genisys

The characters in the movie are good really well based out and well written. All the Terminator movies are good but this one is very well based plenty of action and would appeal to a lot of fans. I would recommend to any Terminator fan or if you haven't seen any of the movies to go watch this as it is so well done and cant really complain about it only improvement needed is the story slightly but overall amazing. The overall acting skills in the movie are great it is funny also and packed with a lot of action.,Terminator Genisys
874,lordvader-43758,not nearly as good...,5,9 August 2015,"T1 and T2 were great. I'd still rate them as the best action movies ever made. T3 and T4 were promising but they couldn't match the high expectations. T5: Throughout the entire movie I had the feeling that Alan Taylor and his crew didn't understand the nature of the machines. Their terminators are humanized and harmless, which makes it more of a human movie. If it wasn't part of the terminator sequel I'd rate it a decent action movie, but since its part of that sequel I rate it a poor copy.T1 and T2 were chase movies. What made them so great is that they didn't seem logically flawed, they had a simple but amazing storyline, good actors, a great soundtrack and a balanced mix of action. You as a viewer had no problem becoming part of the movie, you would easily identify with the protagonists and you'd feel a little chased yourself. The terminators seemed like indestructible, clever killer machines that would never stop their chase and they could at best be slowed down for a moment, it would always be a close chase and at points you'd genuinely get the feeling that the chase is over, the terminator is winning the race and there wont be a happy ending. While it was a simple storyline it was enthralling and yet inscrutable.T5 is none of that. The storyline at all times seems a little unclear (jumping back and forth in time). Maybe thats supposed to create tension but it only creates confusion and raises more questions (in a non smart way), which again makes it less enjoyable to sit in that cinema seat and just watch the movie. T1/T2 didn't do that, they were simple in a very good way.Alan Taylor stated that his movie was misunderstood. Maybe he's right and I didn't understand the movie as a whole but I'd rather say it's him who didn't understand what makes a good Terminator movie. The Movie is rushing from one action scene to the next but it all seems thrown together, heart and soulless. It looks like Alan and his team had a few good ideas but whatever they did they always just ended up scratching the surface. I never had the feeling I was seeing good action scenes, I just felt I was watching scenes out of a computer game. Isn't CGI supposed to become more realistic over the course of time? The T1000 and the T800 looked way better in T1/T2 than it looked in T5. Weird.The Cast sucks too. Jason Clarke as Kyle Reese looks like he spent half his life in the gym, in a time where mankind was on the verge of being eliminated. I wonder where he found all the protein to look like that. It just adds more confusion and again makes the movie less authentic. Besides, Kyle Reese seems more like an obstacle in that movie, he's little to no help, never says anything smart and you just wonder why hes there. If Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor is the hope of mankind I'm the next Jesus. I don't even want to think about why they don't fit in well there, they just don't. If you ask me, at least one of them should have died in that movie but no one ever dies in that movie because there isn't really a threat at any time :(.Altogether it feels like T5 has a confusing storyline, bad actors who aren't really adding credibility to the weak plot. It has CGI effects that look less believable than they did 30 years ago. Machines that aren't really acting like machines. It has comedy and romance elements that it would better not have. In fact, it tries to make it right for each and everyone and therefore isn't more than a Pizza or a Pasta at your average Italian restaurant around the corner. It's quickly forgotten and whats left is the feeling that Terminator 1 and 2 are unique and will remain unique for a longer time if not forever because hopes fading more and more with each Terminator sequel they make.",Terminator Genisys
875,finnbroderick,Terminator Genisys brings a promising return to the classic action franchise!,8,17 August 2015,"After watching the trailers for this movie, I was not expecting much from it. While I did enjoy Salvation to an extent, I still couldn't help but feel somewhat let down. But with the star of the show, the T-800 returning in his full glory, I believed the movie was worth some of my attention. This movie took me by surprise! I found myself enjoying more than I thought. I watched all of the Terminator films, from the spectacular original to the disappointing rise of the machines. Genisys is nowhere near as good as the first two, with some plot holes as well as miscast Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese and more CGI than is really necessary. However, speaking as a Terminator fan, this was the sequel that Judgement Day always deserved in my opinion. I won't spoil any plot points here but I will say that at points it feels a little been there, done that. The film has a lot of callbacks to its predecessors, some for the movies own good, but others just feel chucked in the mix to set off nostalgia. Regardless of these flaws, Terminator fans will no doubt get a kick out this movie. Not the best Terminator film ever, but worthy of even the most dedicated fans time! I have the feeling that this series ""will be back"" in its prime before we know it!",Terminator Genisys

Time travel isn't new since ""Back to Future""! The Movie doesn't care to effectively explain to new audiences who didn't see the franchise, instead they use large numbers of conversations to fill them in!

877,pavlik-69040,This film killed my childhood,1,7 October 2015,"I am reading and reading through the reviews of this film and it makes me feeling so strange. So far, I have only met one person who said it was a good film, but after i talked to him he agreed it was bad, but he just doesn't know a jack about the movies. However, I suppose that on this site, most of the people are well educated in terms of films. So-how come there are so many positive reviews about this so-called film. And I am especially shocked by comments of those who claim to be fans of T-1 and T-2. Perhaps, I do not understand the word ""fan"" properly. T-1 and T-2 are great. T-5 is unbelievably bad. It's some kind of ""Hunger games"", just some colorful images for teenagers with underdeveloped perception and complete absence of taste and common sense. Is there really a need to explain how bad the film is? Isn't it obvious? Well, if it's not obvious for you, than no explanations or reasoning may help. For me T-5 is just spit in my face from Arnold,Cameron (because he said it was good), and the whole crew. It should have never happened. Bad, terrible nonsense.",Terminator Genisys
878,hellraiser-78397,Another kid-friendly mess,5,30 September 2015,"You'd think after movies like RoboCop suffering from lack of quality simply so they can cater to younger audiences, they would at least safeguard such a beloved franchise from further damage. Apparently not. I have to assume this was always an attempt to get more mileage out of an already done-to-death franchise. Why else would they make the T- 800 a dope like they have here. In T-2 where he was a ""guardian"" Terminator, there was always a feeling that the guy's a bad-ass. Here, he's just another version of Optimus Prime, human-loving last-second- arriving bad-one-liner-dropping metal being.All those attempts at doing the light-hearted jokes with unnecessary frequency just dilutes any love a Terminator fan would have for this movie. Because at the end of the day it's a movie about humans surviving an apocalyptic event. But here they turned into yet another movie about the ill-effects of technology over-use. And you know what, we're sick of it. You could start blaming the actors for their performances but I honestly believe they didn't even have a shot with this script. Not a single memorable action sequence, despite all the advances in CGI. And probably that is at fault too, cause at no time did I really buy into these new-look terminators.I think I speak for a lot of people when I say the franchise stopped with T-3, and the rest have all been failed attempts at building on a wonderful movie franchise.",Terminator Genisys
879,tyeecreedo,A Worthy Update to a Classic,8,21 September 2015,"First, I must admit I am a Terminator geek of sorts. Some people dig marvel, some get weird over Star Wars and I profess that this is the case for me with ""Terminator"" lore. I watched T2 just about every day from ages 5-8. It's an exceptional film, definitely a generational benchmark that has been driven into pop- culture sub consciousness for nearly 30 years. Anyway, The third film was pretty decent. I didn't really watch ""Salvation"" too closely because the production design was pretty over exposed and it was all together quite bland. However, opening day I was amped to check out ""Genisys."" The film was very exciting and I loved how it took huge risks with the story. I was happy to see the writers going in bold directions. I also like how it feels like fan service and fan fiction. It pays heavy homage to the original films, obviously, and being such a dork over T2 I was thrilled at how ballsy the story was. The sets were nice and were very reminiscent of Adam Greenberg's brilliant design on T1 and T2. The future war had me geeked out to ridiculous proportions. The 1984 sequence was where I think I spilled some baby sauce on the Imax chair. Loved it. Probs too much. Arnold Schwarzenegger was absolutely brilliant. Stole every scene and draws instant attention every time he's in the frame. The white hair was dope. His costumes were great. His dialogue was excellent and his performance was top-notch. The final sequence of the film was stellar, felt like a comic book movie which is a new direction and in 2015, obviously a relevant one. Lorne Balfe's score was superb. Hospital fight was awesome and engaging. The movie is respectful to the universe and I loved that. Jason Clarke was having a blast as John Connor. I dig his ""everyman"" vibe and he really was quite wonderful. Emilia Clarke needs acting classes badly. Her scenes are downright painful a lot of the time. I feel like she has never watched a Terminator film, which leads me to the films biggest issue-Jai Courtney. He walks and talks like he has no respect for the iconic role he's portraying. I'm guessing he had no knowledge of the franchise before being handed what will most likely be the biggest role of his career. Absolutely doesn't belong there. With a stronger actor I think Emilia Clarke would have been able to sell her portrait easier. Back to TV acting for ol Jai ""Pinocchio"" Courtney. Yuck. Terrible. However, I did really love the concepts and execution of the film. I feel like tension was zapped by Courtney and Emilia, two inexplicable burgeoning young Hollywood faces that really show how green they are as they bog down all believable elements in the film. Basically, we don't give a hoot if they die (in the film). In fact, I'd actually kinda dig that because they need to respawn at UCLA and study the basic elements of how to make something remotely tense or believable. Anyway, still loved it. I put it right up there with T2 because I love how bold they went with the story and how they attempted to make something worthy of fan approval. Most franchises could care less. The film feels Marvel-ish. Personally I don't watch much superhero stuff, but I didn't mind that. Gotta make kids buy tickets in 2015. Opening night for TG was dreadful. Ten people including me. Don't care. Go Terminator.",Terminator Genisys
880,INhUMANE,Awesome,7,30 June 2015,"I'm a huge Terminator fan (The first 2) and Arnold was my childhood. This movie was awesome a great add on to the originals. The effects were superb and the IMAX 3D was on point. Arnold was great and as always killed the roll he was born to play, Sarah Conner was great and really stuck out, John Conner was well played and so was Reese. I had high expectations after the trailer and the plot came out and this blew it away. A must see. James Cameron was right when he said we all finally got the sequel we wanted to see since Judgment Day. I can't say it enough....See this film. ARNOLD is back just like he said",Terminator Genisys
881,breakerbum-30505,Shell of itself,1,18 September 2018,"Genisys reminded me of Highlander 2, the movie that fans wish they could forget. This final Terminator film was deplorable, its only saving grace being Emilia Clarke's cleavage popping tops. Amen to that. Aside from that, though, characters were utterly vacuous, even poor Arnie. The storyline was a mess, the dialogue stilted, and the raw humanness and urgency of love that we found with the original Sarah and Kyle was forced, angsty, glossy. This Kyle isn't a burnt, scarred, emaciated war hero from the future; this Kyle is a pampered musclehead who just got a wax job after visiting his favorite GNC outlet. Movie is complete garbage.

883,iHaveBankai,Worst Terminator Yet,5,16 August 2015,"If you are a person who appreciated the first couple of Terminator movies, this movie will leave you sourly disappointed. However, if you're into the modern-day non-stop action, non-stop explosions, plots that make no sense or take 3rd or 4th precedence over computer graphics, then this movie is for you.If you're OK with a Terminator getting killed by a sniper bullet at the start of the film, followed by the same model Terminator (Pops) not being able to be killed by the most sophisticated weapon ever devised (the new John Connor), then this movie is for you.If you're OK with a Terminator more advanced than liquid-metal T1000 getting punched to death, which is what the characters in this movie were doing for half of the film with the new John Connor, then this movie is definitely for you.This movie lacks any sort of realistic dialogue, the characters take what is happening around them, including debilitating injuries, explosions, almost getting killed over and over, and travelling from one time to another to another with such a carefree, chipper attitude, you'd think they do it everyday. Or that they just walked out of a Marvel movie.To the film makers. We know that you're writing a sci-fi, but if there is no connection to real life, common sense, laws of physics, then your audience will fall asleep and be forced to re-watch your movie like I did. Lastly, remember that less is more. The less explosions, bus flips, helicopter twirls you have, the more the audience actually appreciates when you have one. I don't think anyone has forgotten the liquid nitrogen truck that flipped over in Terminator 2. As for this movie, you had so many of them, the audience would be lucky (or unlucky, depending on how you look at it) to remember ANYTHING from this movie.Terminator Salvation was vastly better than this movie, because at least it was memorable. What I've seen in Genesys I feel like I've seen in tens of other movies.",Terminator Genisys
884,jelkuba,New ideas built in old movie,7,9 February 2018,"After seeing Terminator: Genisys I felt something like deja vu. Film makers came with new ideas, and created a whole new plot. Let's be honest, it's definitely not as good as previous movies, but the way the film proceeds to a viewer is strangely satisfying. The behavior of the guardian, excellently shown in Terminator 2 is enhanced with more embarrassing moments and genius Schwarzenegger smiles. Sometimes it feels like Arnold Schwarzenegger inspired himself during watching The Big Bang Theory. The similarity to acting like Sheldon Cooper is obvious, guaranteed by long senseless scientific monologues. As mentioned before, the Genisys takes inspiration from the former Terminator movies. Sarah Connor is however no longer frightened waitress but a brave warrior protected by 'grandpa'. Some may not like the way this film interrupts the previous movies, but I like the concept of making an alternate history with some gamechanging moments. However, there are some flaws thanks to which I don't rate the film better. Firstly, even it is individual, I don't like Emilia Clarke. Her acting so actually very poor in comparison to other actors, which is even more serious as she plays the main role. The role of a brave warrior does not fit her. Secondly, the film makers were so interested with the plot line that they created pilot so twisted and unexplained that some things seem irrelevant and impossible to understand. Where the hell did they take the guardian if the first Terminator was supposed to kill Sarah? And if the Judgment Day took place in 1997, how could the world in 2017 look normal? This playing with presence-past-future scenes is very unclear and I tried to understand the meaning of creators instead of enjoying the film. In conclusion the film takes lighter pace than its ancestors and is not as bad as it may seem. The biggest flaw of the movie is in making new ideas to involve, but in the end just scraping the barrel. 7/10",Terminator Genisys

This film has some good idea, some good dialog, some interesting concepts. Very creative as for that.
The acting is a little bit dull, however they think of a new type of enemy, and brought back the old T-1000, but in an interesting way. Ok, not a T1 nor T2 (because that two is impossible to beat) but this film is entertaining, and can be interesting. Give it a chance",Terminator Genisys

Nostalgia boosted the Jurassic World ratings it seems, but it has worked against Terminator Genisys. IMHO too many of them had prejudged the movie simply because Cameron wasn't involved, just as has happened in this franchise before. This is a very worthy entry in the series, easily better in my opinion than both T3 and Salvation. It's more of a return to the feel of the first two movies, with a clever twist on the plot that sets things up for future movies to come.If anything the twist may have been a bit too clever for its own good, if you're not used to sci-fi concepts like multiple universes and alternate timelines you'll have to pay close attention to avoid getting lost. In fact one of the most interesting implications for subsequent movies (the true origin of the so-called T-5000) didn't occur to me until after I'd read an interview with one of the cast as the movie itself didn't labour that particular point.In short, this is well worth your time if you're a fan of the series.",Terminator Genisys

890,c_tandberg,Terminator Cosplay,10,26 October 2019,"I'm a big fan of the Terminator films and it was great to see the first cosplay version of the entire franchise crammed into one film. All the actors, Emilia and Jason Clarke, and especially Jai Courtney that is so out of his comfort zone from his day job as a model, are all excellent pretenders in Terminator Genisys. Jason Clarke has never played a tough guy in a role before, so naturally it was an ironic but excellent choice to give him the role as the hard boiled tough guy John Connor. Emilia Clarke as a young and rebellious teenager? Sure why not! Schwarzenegger as pops? Wow, I never expected that! We all know that Terminators are excellent at pretending to be human, so it's only natural that these actors pretend to be the original cast from the previous films, and I say they do a great job at it! I get that the storyline in this movie is not meant to be taken seriously since this is only a parody, so don't look to hard into it. But still go and see this movie, it's mainly for laughs anyway!",Terminator Genisys

892,thoth-04452,Good film despised by troglodytes,7,21 March 2020,"This is a pretty good film. Great acting (Schwarzenegger, the Clarkes and the incredibly creepy Lee Byung-hun in particular), great music, great special effects, good cinematography, and it manages to have a lot of funny moments without spoiling the movie's action-drama theme. The plot is a bit complicated, but that also makes it intriguing, and I love the various spins they did on the original (like the scene with the punks, where it seems to be identical to Terminator 1 at first). I thought the movie's message about today's dependence on digital technologies was interesting, given that Terminator isn't really a franchise known for its philosophical depth.Unfortunately, these kind of movies bring out rock-living dinosaurs who feel an urge to crusade against them for the cardinal sin of ""murdering"" their old beloved movies, especially when, as in this instance, they try to pursue new and innovative plotlines. Of course, when remakes merely clone the original, they still get an earful from these nostalgia-addled greybeards for replacing outdated practical effects with million-dollar CGI so the new younger generation who grew up in the twenty-first century won't laugh at them. While these critics may fill their angry reviews with platitudes like ""cynical"", ""soulless"" and ""cash grab"" and pick nits with greater ferocity than a North Korean child looking for something to eat, in the end their only real crime is being new, and belonging to a new generation. Hope these people develop their own Time Weapon one day.",Terminator Genisys
893,Dan_Sowels,"Stop reading reviews from idiotic critics, THIS is an awesome Terminator film",10,17 July 2015,"This movie was terrific, plain and simple. That being said, it's not perfect. This movie did have plot holes, deliberately left open due to this being the first of a standalone trilogy, but they didn't bother me at all. The first moments with CGI Arnold on screen, I got pumped. They brilliantly recreated the first moments of the 1984 film perfectly, I almost thought it was a shot-for-shot remake of the first one (in a good way), then it definitely became it's own thing. I was originally worried about the casting of Jai Courtney, personally, I would've preferred Anton Yelchin, seeing how he looks more like the character, but seeing how the Director was probably a fan of Game of Thrones, he wanted the whole cast in the film apparently. Courtney wasn't bad, he actually surprised me a little bit, and he didn't really take away from the film too much. Bottom line, the film had a few unexpected twists, and the writers definitely know what the hell they're doing. The critics are bashing this film unfairly, as they seem to do with a lot of Science Fiction. The plot is easy to keep up with, and it was definitely a well- needed sequel in the Terminator franchise. Blows 3 and Salvation out of the water.",Terminator Genisys

895,gilga,Good entertainment with some flaws,7,19 October 2015,"And Arnold was great! Seeing him age, and how they implemented that into the movie was cool. I liked the special effects of the new generation terminator. The story line was a little stretched and might left a few too many things unexplained. Well.. this opens up the option for more sequels obviously. Overall it was solid enough to not distract too much. One thing though almost made us stop watching the movie. This 'Kyle Reese' character spoiled the movie very seriously. He behaved unrealistically stupid and dense, and this had a quite disturbing effect to the story. And according to the female audience sitting next to me, his looks added quite negatively to the movie as well. Maybe another ending with him would have made some viewers feel better..",Terminator Genisys
896,gessember,It doesn't feel like the Terminator movies I know,6,4 July 2015,"As a die-hard Terminator fan who loves the first two movies, I found Terminator Genisys to be a let-down. Probably because it does not feel like the Terminator films I knew. The first two films had the thrilling tone that should make the viewers be on the edge of their seats and Genisys does not live up to any of that. Genisys felt very forced into catering to the average audience's viewing experiences.Genisys is trying to emulate the Marvel film style and I do not agree with that. Terminator films should follow what was set from the first and second films. It should be for suspenseful, dark, and thrilling and not be comedic and cheesy. I believe this could be caused by Marvel's style of movie-making after Marvel's success with their box-office juggernauts.As a general overview without spoiling the film, Genisys starts off with a narration probably for those who haven't seen the previous films or are in need of a refresher. This may feel boring to those familiar with the series already, but whatever. I felt that it was little too long and should've been shorter with simple text on screen or a couple sentences like the first and second Terminator movie.Then we are presented with a new timeline in the Terminator universe. All the events from the first Terminator changed because there was a new event that happened before the events of the first movie and changed everything afterwards. And this is probably the one thing from this film that I did not like most in this new Terminator trilogy. There is too much time-traveling and change of events that it creates confusing alternate timelines that are so unlike the previous Terminator films.The tone of Genisys is unlike any Terminator movie. There is too much comedy being forced in to make the viewers laugh a bit. The dialogue can be very cheesy and lackluster because there are scenes where they re-used the same lines from previous films to just so the viewers can get a cheap hype up for a bit. I couldn't truly take Emilia Clarke to be a serious Sarah Connor because this is not the Sarah Connor that I used to know from the previous films but she did an okay job. Pacing was pretty good in this film. One soundtrack in a scene seemed a bit ridiculous.Overall, this film is more catered to the general audience. It has some good actions scenes and an okay plot but there are times where the CGI and special-effects become overkill. Genisys, however, does not meet my expectations of a Terminator movie where there it is more dark with suspense and terror to leave viewers on the edge of their seats.",Terminator Genisys
897,bpsitrep,Terminator series is terminated,5,10 July 2015,"I loved the first movie, second one was okay....'Salvation' I kind of enjoyed because there was no 'time travel'. One movies start down this 'alternate' time-line story line....it's JUMPING THE SHARK!. I was kind of looking forward to Genisys, seeing Arnold back in action.....but then the story went down that road.....'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'.....the paranoia that destroyed the Battlestar Galactica, Falling Skies series for me as well. Who is a real human being. Then I started thinking about the 'technology' the writers keep throwing in T800 now T5000? C'mon man. I know this supposed to be a review.....

It is however in my humble opinion a real misfire. The cast are awfully wooden, the story somewhat a confused & convoluted mess and whilst I love movies with a time travel element to them, this just doesn't hold up. Arnold is woefully average here (you thought T3 was bad?). They've ignored what made the first 2 films a wonderful movie going experience & gone for an OTT FX bonanza that is a completely hollow experience when you strip away all the work. It muddles from scene to scene with banal exposition & often stupidity. It pains me to say as I'm an 80's/90's Schwarzenegger fan but we deserved far better than what was on offer here.

900,moonvibe34,Genisys=Terminator Awesomeness!,10,4 July 2015,"Warning: Some spoilers included.I have been endlessly fascinated and captivated by the Terminator story line ever since I saw the first one as a kid back in '84. Naturally T2 blew me away like it did most everyone else at the time of it's release, and through the years both have proved to be permanent staples of what my imagination craves. I never tire of anything Terminator related and still watch the first two movies multiple times every year. I didn't hate T3. It was, in my opinion, a good effort at advancing the Terminator mythology, but it somehow failed to deliver in certain ways that left more to be desired. Terminator Salvation had my hopes high for an all out post Judgement Day setting where surely Skynet and it's merciless army of machines would clash with John Connor and his resistance fighters for the ultimate spectacle of Terminator awesomeness. Man was I thoroughly disappointed in the shortcomings of that dud.And don't even get me started on how much my heart broke when the Sarah Connor Chronicles got axed by a short-sighted network. Some wounds never mend...So needless to say I was both excited and apprehensive when I first caught wind of a new Terminator movie in the works, especially when the word trilogy was thrown around. I always want more Terminator, but quality over quantity is what matters to me. I went into the theater earlier this week for Genisys with high hopes, but low expectations.AFter 5 viewings to date, I can honestly say it's the Terminator movie I have been wanting since the credits rolled for T2. I was riveted by the whole thing from start to finish. The post Judgement Day future sequences were phenomenal. Exactly how I've always imagined it would be. In fact, the movie hit virtually on every point and theme which makes the Terminator universe so awesome and enthralling.The 1984 segments gave me chills. The movie definitely recaptured some of the magic and coolness from the first two films there while adding something fresh and exciting at the same time. Then the time-hopping to 2017 really set the stage for the twisty, action-packed second half. Even knowing about the John Connor twist beforehand didn't take away from watching it all unfold and impacting the plot as the race against the countdown to Skynet's arrival began. And the confrontations which ensued between opposing forces were nothing short of breathtaking and thrilling. Having two different Terminator models which can go toe-to-toe in brutally bashing battles certainly amped up all the exhilarating action sequences too. ;)The story was very cleverly contrived also, revealing bits of intrigue as it progressed while leaving some very interesting questions to be asked. It's the kind of story like the first two, that both satisfies and leaves you wanting more. The nods and ties to existing Terminator mythology was great too. This movie felt like a complete Terminator story, thanks in large part to the events of T1 and T2 which were crafted in and built upon to reach new territory in the franchise.It was really fun to see familiar characters again too, even if the faces were new. Mostly anyway. Arnold was just as awesome as always as the venerable T-800 that really is the staple of the Terminator universe if you ask me. The way his age was accounted for was just brilliant storytelling that worked. Emilia Clarke's Sarah was feisty and strong willed with a nice touch of humanity to keep her from being a cold, bitter victim of fate. Jai Courtney's Reese was loyal, dutiful, and filled with enough bravado to make him the time traveling soldier/protector he was destined to be. I enjoyed the conflicting chemistry between Kyle and Sarah that developed thanks to the changes in events which changed expectations, but not the feelings they would both ultimately succumb to for each other. Jason Clarke's John Connor oozed delectable charisma in both his incarnations. He was an intriguing and formidable villain just as much as he was a heroic and revered leader of men. And the addition of J.K. Simmons' O'Brien was a welcome injection of a new believer in the Terminator saga.One more thing really worth mentioning too is the musical score of Genisys. The modified versions of classic Terminator music and sounds were incorporated masterfully into this new story. Thanks to the excellent use and timing of the incredible musical score, the action scenes were pulse-ramping, the poignant scenes had increased depth, and the overall movie had nostalgic vibes which somehow felt fresh and exciting. I really cannot praise the composers enough for the way the music and sounds helped to fuel this movie.So is Genisys a flawless movie? Of course not, but to me it's about as perfect as a Terminator movie can be. It didn't disappoint on any level to me, and whether or not sequels are built upon the rubble of Cyberdyne left in it's wake, Terminator Genisys is the success I've always hoped for in this franchise.",Terminator Genisys
901,Dembilaja,Could have been a lot better,1,1 October 2015,"I have lowered expectations so much for this movie after watching a trailer where they revealed what happened to John Connor,activated ultra dumb mode of state of mind,and well...Actually enjoyed it... Even went to watch it with different crew for second time,again with dumb mode activated. Thing was also that I haven't watched any of them Terminator joints in years. I've decided to rewatch all of them... Then gave a go to a TG for a THIRD time. ...TS is T2 for TG... Terminator 3 is million times better movie than this.... Actually my opinion on T3 has greatly improved. This movie is one giant convoluted mess... Seems point of this movie was to be built around notion that real Arnold must be in it at any cost. Seems like someone from producers found out in his/her attic a dusty notebook with Terminator fanfiction 11-13 yo has written in it after watching T2 back in the day.Talking by cast... Well performance from its new lead in Jai Courtney (guy that is getting pushed as a next big thing), is God damn awful,chemistry between him and Emilia Clarke on screen is equal to one Emilia Cclarke and I posses between ourselves. It took me third watching to realize that 90 percent of stuff he says are supposed to be...Jokes ? Was that supposed to be their take on traumatized,jumpy Kyle Reese we all know from T1 ? By making him whiny,buffed up,wise cracker. Visually this movie looks like half baked MCU movie even most fanatical MCU fans don't really like nor care that much about. Only positives I can single out are Arnold,Emilia's take on Sarah Connor, and T-3000s design...Oh yes,great missed chance with JC turning into a machine, just made him bland Guardians Of The Galaxy/Thor 2,villain you know it is getting destroyed anyway at the end of the movie,since he was always one of characters of less importance in Terminator series...Anyway...I am huge Arnold fanboy,but I am not even sure I would like to see a sequel...We all know this going to be rebooted sooner or later... Let's hope they will hire someone talented to direct,and write a script.My advice for watching of this movie is that you haven't watched any other Terminator movie in a long,long time,and put yourself in state of mind like you are about to watch Transformers 7, or similar type of movie,hell,it may even turn out great.",Terminator Genisys

The liberties used as far as changing or altering the time lines seemed corny at first but after watching it made an enjoyable movie going experience. Casting appearances of the major players (Sarah and Kyle) along with other BG characters from the original (the punks and the derelict) did not resemble in appearance but still convinced me and made the film what it was.Seeing the post apocalyptic future was a nice touch as we finally get to when Connor sent Reese back to 1984 and the battle(s) prior to that though I'm still not happy with the inconsistency between Cameron's HKs, the drones from part 3 and Salvation... The new design on the 800 though minor is also another but I'm just being picky. I'm sure with the time lines changing, there is a reason for that there. Though the character's part was short, it is as still pretty cool seeing the original T-800 in action, thanks to the T-1000's help.",Terminator Genisys

The remaking of scenes from previous movies was handled extremely well and transitioned well into the rest of the movie. The plot was high quality with great dialogue and characters. The accuracy of time travel was as good as the previous movies in the series. Schwarzenegger did an awesome job reprising his role, Emilia Clarke does an great job of channeling Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor. Jai Courtney had a solid performance as Kyle Reese and while Jason Clarke (as John Connor) was my least favorite of the main actors he put in a solid performance.I am a long time Terminator fan and was not expecting great things from the movie.

It hurt me, Im genuinely distraught.When I heard they were producing a new Terminator I was apprehensive, what started out as a once great franchise has been marred with misgivings for quite some time but I wanted to believe it could be something again. At the very least I was expecting some thrills and a mildly entertaining action film, what I got was a train wreck of muddled plot points, illogical structures and a complete crumbling of a much beloved film franchise.Im a fan of the Terminator franchise, while 3 and Salvation are often considered pretty dire, I honestly thought thats as low as you could get but this film s*&ts all over those two. It disregards absolutely everything we appreciated about 1 & 2. The whole story is a confused mess and I genuinely found it boring, I love cinema yet I found myself staring at my watch more than once throughout. I am actually in disbelief as to how it's already been commissioned for 2 other films as part of a new trilogy and am shocked that Cameron gave it his blessing. It doesn't make sense to me, not one bit.Im not gonna spoil anything for anyone, all I can say is don't go see it. Wait until its released on DVD or whatever else because you're missing nothing on the big screen and all you are doing is giving money to something that deserves to be forgotten. I don't usually write reviews on IMDb, this is my first I think, at least my first in living memory but I was so outraged by what I've just witnessed that I had to warn you whoever reads this, save you money and 2 plus hours on anything else. 1 star is all its getting and thats only because I cant give lower.",Terminator Genisys
906,sannorius,This is an abomination to the Terminator Franchise,3,15 July 2015,"Dear readers,I rarely take the time to review titles on this big website, but this time is different. I think it's important to make a statement regarding the latest Terminator movie. It really hurt my expectations, in a way only sequels to great films can do. Remember the last Indiana Jones movie? Well ladies and gentlemen, this is far worse. I absolutely LOVED the terminator films. The story is great and timeless. It invites you to use your imagination, to wonder off in what if's for as long as you want. The script of the first two Terminators's are amongst the coolest I've ever seen. It's like reading an awesome Sci Fi book.So it really saddens me to say, ladies and gentlemen, this movie, should never, ever have been made. Why?1) The plot holes are way too big. It sickens me that people with that kind of budget don't put any effort in a decent scenario and script. It made me sad. And then I realized that I had been watching for only 5 minutes. The more I watches, the worse it got. It physically hurt my body.2) The acting, especially that of Jai Courtney makes it almost unbearable. What have you done with Kyle Reese? Muscles with puppy eyes? Over the top emotional scenes with a gladiator that is suppose to give his life for our amusement after 5 minutes on the screen? Romance and falling in love with him? No! This is not a teenage flick! This is not the Twighlight Saga!! This is TERMINATOR!!! A cold and harsh universe of pain and suffering. The others could never, even for a second, deliver a worthy scene. They didn't feel real. At least Arnold stays Arnold. Never any acting involved. He is a perfect terminator, although he was not respected as he should have been. Instead he is a soft and old terminator referred to as 'pops'.

The future war - it was about time we got a good look at this.Cons: Emilia Clarke is no Linda Hamilton, although she is good. Jai Courtney is no Michael Biehn... Not even remotely. Some dialogue was so shoddily written that I've seen better fan fiction terminator material (to be fair, the aforementioned fan fic was excellent for what it was). Matt Smith was under-utilised. Bad Boys... Really?! The ending is typical of current movie-making trends in that it has both a positive yet cheesy outcome, and a mod-credits hook for potential sequels.While the above list is quantitatively biased against the movie, my enjoyment of the movie was only slightly diminished, and I could talk more about the pros and cons of the plot points, direction, effects and performances (perhaps I'll point to a blog post somewhere for a more in- depth analysis) suffice to say that while others may disagree, I hope the sequels are made (I hate unfinished storytelling), and before Cameron gets the rights back (although if he wanted to make his own movie continuation, I wouldn't object, it's just I read he was done with the story years ago once T2 was released).",Terminator Genisys

Poor acting and unconvincing development of relations between the main actors.

Jason Clarke was not given enough space as an actor. He is poorly reduced to an icon of a resistance without the possibility to expose a real emotion.

The first 20 minutes were just a carbon copy of the first film, people knew what happened you don't need to redo it shot for shot.

One major change is the T-1000 chasing Kyle instead of the the 2 cops so I don't know with the speed the T-1000 can reach the tracking its able of it wouldn't of panned out the way it did. One thing that annoyed me in this scene is when he is changing clothes ""lets not trap him in the changing booth just go round and risk missing him by aiming at either side of him"". Why did Sarah Conor have to load the gun to kill the Terminator but every time the rifle is used later on it's loaded? Now lets kill the T-1000 by holding him underneath this corrosive liquid, how did Arnie's arm not get lost but the more advanced T-1000 did?Arnie is good.Worse child actor.Just upgraded.........

The character development is generic, the main cast except for John Conner are so wooden and lifeless, especially Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) - it felt like a B movie taking itself very seriously if not for the huge budget on special effects. There was a brief break when a reporter O'Brien (great actor J.K. Simmons) takes center stage, but it wasn't developed further.The script is the main culprit, it's a convoluted mess.

The action scenes are awesome. The return of Arnold as ""The terminator"" was one thing that I have awaited for a very long time. Seeing him as ""guardian"" in the movie was unexpected but I liked him in his new avatar.Although Emilia Clarke was unable to deliver justice to Sarah Connor, the same goes with Jason Clarke.To summarize folks, I will recommend this movie to all those who have seen & enjoyed the last terminator movies, but not to them who haven't seen any of them because if you go, it will blow your brains out.P.S.

915,ronbro1967,"Nothing is perfect, but this movie is pretty damn close...",8,13 July 2015,"I've never been moved to write a review of a movie before.I was so disappointed with what we got with Terminator Salvation. I didn't know what Terminator Genisys would bring to the franchise. But I was sold within the first 15 minutes of the film.I'm not going to give any plot details or spoilers. But unlike TS, this actually felt like a Terminator film. Emilia Clarke was absolutely a perfect recast for Sarah Connor. The movie perfectly recreated key scenes from the original movie and touched on iconic scenes from T2 without wasting story time in a new movie. The story was gripping. There were several scenes that could bring out goosebumps to the most cynical viewer. An aging Arnold was perfectly used to flesh out the T- 800 and made it an interesting character. The soundtrack paid homage to the original and T2 soundtracks as well.Well, in the end, I don't think I've really written a review. But what I've expressed here are heartfelt raves after just seeing the film. It is a very welcome addition to the franchise.",Terminator Genisys
916,jph1229,"Wow, actually pretty good... very surprised",8,30 June 2015,"I don't understand what some people expect when I read their reviews. They're acting like this is supposed to be Grammy nominated type of movie. For the genre, I thought they did a very good job with it compared to terrible movies like transformers and even some of the super hero movies. Not sure why people dogged out the acting and actor choices, either. Maybe at first I was weary, but definitely grew on me.Anyways, with that out of the way, I just want to say I am a mega huge fan of Terminator 1 and 2, and like most people, I'm not the biggest fan of 3 and 4. Terminator 3 is okay but 4 (salvation) is just terrible. I wasn't really sure what to expect. I went in thinking, ""if it is better than salvation than I didn't completely waste my money."" In other words, I had the bar set pretty low. Don't get me wrong, not saying this was better than Terminator 1 and 2. Those are classics, and besides, movies always work that way. You can't expect the movies down the line to be better than the originals. Almost never happens, if ever at all. But this one definitely fits nicely behind those two.Not gonna say anything specific to spoil anything, but I thought the storyline was original. Like a lot of time travel movies, I may need to watch some parts again to completely understand what's going on with ""loops"" and all the ""time travel rules,"" but, for the most part, I thought it was fresh. It definitely outdid the previous two, especially terminator 4! Basically, if you are huge terminator 1 and 2 fans like myself, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. I can't believe how good it was to be honest. I think the last couple had you expecting it to be terrible, but it wasn't at all. The storyline will keep you wondering what is going to happen, and the action scenes are really good. If you are new to the series, I think you will be pleasantly surprised as well. Hopefully, this one can get you to watch the first two classics (and maybe 3 but skip 4).",Terminator Genisys
917,klgourley-196-480027,Really Disappointed,4,5 July 2015,"I hate to admit it, but I was really rather disappointed in the movie. It is my least favorite of all five. I think Kyle Reese was poorly cast. John Connor was cast poorly as well; I'd preferred Christian Bale from the last movie. I thought the woman cast as Sarah Connor was okay, but still looked a bit too young. No complaints with Arnold. I am also not really comfortable with the direction they went with Skynet. I had high hopes for this film, but I can't give it a thumbs up. I'm sure I'll watch it again when it comes out on DVD or Netflix, but I think the franchise ends with the film before this: ""Terminator: Salvation"" - which is a decent movie. There were some cool nods to the old films and you get to see what supposedly took place right before the first Terminator was sent back to 1984, but that's about all the positives I have for it.",Terminator Genisys

The story is not straighten forward and not in a good way.It will disappoint hardcore fans of terminator.Bringing back arnold and casting was one of the reasons that i watched it.

920,DeadAddiction,"Thoughts from a bonafide Terminator fan, even off T3 and salvation",10,2 July 2015,"I just came back from seeing Terminator Genisys tonight. A triple screening at my local theatre of The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgement Day & Terminator Genisys. This turned out to be a rather bittersweet event, as Terminator Genisys was almost at an unfair advantage after seeing 2 action masterpieces directed by arguably one of the best, most innovative directors on the planet. Awesome seeing T1 and 2 on the big screen again, but that's not what I'm here to discuss. Despite all the hate from critics from the outset, I had gone in with an open mind. I knew I was going to like this movie on some degree, as it was always gonna be a 'bold' entry into the franchise, and for that I commend it. I also loved the fact they changed Arnold's attire, the leather and sunglasses as iconic as they are have been used to death. So that was refreshing. Brings me to the best thing about this film, Arnold. I have enjoyed his movies since his comeback but this is by far his best performance. He slides back into the roll with ease. I actually felt attached to this incarnation of the T-800 far more than T3. I think they went a little overboard with the humor but not as much as T3. The action was outstanding, I absolutely John Connor loved as the villain, it was interesting to see a Terminator's defensive/offensive movements behave like corrupted data, or a real life virus. I thought Jason Clarke absolutely nailed it. I thought Byun-Hun Lee was amazing as the T-1000, I was worried he would not be convincing enough but he nailed it. I wish he had a more extended role. I thought Emilia Clarke took SOME getting used to as Sarah Connor but I warmed to her pretty quickly, I found her relationship with 'Pops' to be very convincing and pleasantly reminded me of a Young John Connor and 'Uncle Bob'. JK Simmons was great as O'Brien, really believed him in this role. Matt Smith was fine, pretty much the one thing in the entire film that wasn't spoiled for me so I found solace in the fact that his character was completely unknown to me. Now this is were the movie falls down for me.. Jai Courtney. What the hell were they thinking? How could the writers have been satisfied with his audition if there was one. Someone wants this guy to do well, but putting him into beloved franchises is not going to help, I'm sorry. I guess I DID buy into him as Kyle Reese eventually, but to me he does not look like a guy who has been in hiding and feeding off dead rats for over a decade. CGI was awesome in parts but one or two sequences could have just benefited from practical effects. Did the 12a or 'PG13' rating bother me? Not in the slightest. A tiny bit more gore wouldn't have gone a miss but it really didn't affect the movie enough for me to take away points, nor the lack of nudity. It was fine. One thing that bothered me however was how 'top critics' said this movie was 'confusing' and 'convoluted'. I'm sorry to be frank, but you honestly must be a MORON to have found this confusing, it is literally spelled out right in front of you, almost to an extent where it makes you feel like a moron. WHAT was confusing? Elaborate please. I also enjoyed the ending, when I had it spoiled for me I cringed, however in context it made sense and I'm really happy with it. Overall, this is DEFINITELY the best entry in the franchise since T2, I know that doesn't sound like much but if someone tells you Salvation or Rise of the Machines is better, they are simply wrong in my opinion. This movie is bold, interesting, action packed and a breath of fresh air into the franchise in my opinion. A solid 8/10 (May have been 8.5 if it wasn't for Jai Courtney)",Terminator Genisys
921,rstayte8,Better luck next time,4,31 August 2015,"Terminator Genisys attempts to reboot the Terminator series whilst also being a direct sequel to the first film. That right there tells you that this film doesn't feel like doing much new with its story or characters or giving this series new life, instead taking us through heaps of exposition, many continuity errors and pretty weak and somewhat one-note characterization. This would have been forgivable if the action was on-par with the other films, but they all provided more interesting set pieces than this one, with heavy doses of CGI and no creativity when it comes to the action. Whilst it is entertaining on a superficial level, it's too fast paced to be invested in and grows tiresome after a while. Ultimately, Terminator Genisys is somewhat better than the last 2 entries in the series, due to being slightly more ambitious and more plot focused, but even they were more memorable than this one. This isn't the worst movie of summer 2015(That honor goes to either Fantastic Four or Tomorrowland), but it is the most forgettable, and proves that certain franchises should be created with more care and more creativity, instead of just going through the motions.And wow was that Mid-credits scene pointless. Note to Hollywood, If your're going to have a mid credits scene in a movie, have it feel like it'll lead to something, instead of just a tired ""GOTCHA!"" moment.",Terminator Genisys
922,magnum-a,Expected disappointment,1,1 October 2015,"That's my first review, English is not my primary language, so don't judge me strictly. This movie could be rated 6, if it had other than Terminator name and had some different story. So to say - the movie for one time and it can be forgotten in about a week. But this is difficult to forget, such a mockery of legendary movies (Terminator 1 and 2) should be punishable. Especially annoying, when James Cameron himself is so positive about this ""sequel"". How was he persuade? Money is not exactly necessary for him. I just don''t understand. Anyway. The film itself is not serious, the whole story turned upside down, the acting - just terrible, constantly repeated cues from the first two parts - sick of it. Can''t come up with something new and cool? Visual effects came from somewhere of 2008, looks so unrealistic. And leave Arni alone already, he is old. No need to sully his reputation filming in this third class film! Let's say, Salvation without Schwarzenegger is so much better. The film is more independent and interesting, with a good atmosphere. It depends on a director. And that why this buddy - Alan Taylor should be publicly hanged. Maybe others will think twice then or at least try to make a excellent movie, not the one to milk money from fans using a classic title.P.S. By the way, wouldn't it be a good a thing to have a money back if you paid to watch such an ""outstanding masterpiece"" and didn't like it? You can return any product in a store if you are not satisfied with it's quality. This movie quality is awful! Why not to apply this for cinema?",Terminator Genisys

925,lt_027,A worthy entry that reinvigorates the Terminator franchise,9,3 July 2015,"As a longtime fan of the Terminator movies dating back from the first movie, Genisys exceeded all my expectations. After Terminator 3 and Salvation I held little expectation for Genisys after it was announced; after all it's another reboot of a prestigious Hollywood franchise. After seeing the first trailer for Genisys, I was not completely sold; hell even sitting down before watching the movie I wasn't sold. However, after finally seeing the movie, mostly all of my doubts were proved wrong. The story will keep you occupied all the way through to the credits. There are many instances of implausible scenarios, but these are simply petty details that do not derail the quality of the film. A 60 year old (damn close to 70) Arnold knocked his return to his career defining role out of the park. His performance in Genisys is simply excellent. His relationship to Sarah is worthy of comparison to his 'Uncle Bob' relationship with young John Connor in T2. Although the other characters took some getting used to, I eventually warmed up to them. Emilia Clarke was exceptional as Sarah Connor. However, Jason Clarke and Jai Courtney left something more to be desired with John Connor and Kyle Reese.Lastly, the way Genisys paid homage to the first two movies is absolutely brilliant. So ignore the horrible criticisms slapped onto this film by major critics and see for yourself a truly brilliant and worthy entry into the Terminator franchise.",Terminator Genisys
926,tocoexist,"Best Sequel Since T2, with better acting performances",8,22 July 2016,"Quite simply a fantastic entry into the series. Yes, it ignore Salvation and the abomination that was Rise Of The Machines. A very wise choice indeed. I keep reading the lines with the words ""confusing"" describing the plot from critics. How is this remotely confusing in the slightest? This was realistically the most logically linear story lines out of every installment. What's so confusing? But I did forget that people don't actually read anymore and are nearly tone-deaf ignorant when it comes to acceptance of a new installment that challenges them to think. The only flaw in this film was Jai Courtney's buffoon interpretation of Kyke Reese which despite gradually coming to terms with his place in the scheme of the movie and it's altered timeline, he was a pale comparison to Micheal Biehn. On the contrary Emilia Clarke turns out an exceptionally convincing performance as Sarah Conner. Honestly I prefer her take on the character over everyone's beloved Linda Hamilton. Clarke was tender while maintaining and hardened exterior. A much better bead on reality. This sequel had the right blend of humor (not over the top), drama and action. One of Schwarzenegger's best post-gubernatorial roles to boot. All in all the critics got this one totally wrong at the time of release and it is a shame that it did not perform well at the box office. Or is it? Perhaps it is better as a stand-alone film sequel to finally close the chapter on the franchise. I know I will revisit this edition again years to come.",Terminator Genisys
927,kecskes-roli,It's Okay.,6,26 March 2018,"Once again, Hollywood has made a movie because of the nostalgia factor. Although it was great to see Arnold in his legendary role, I think the movie took itself too seriously with those twists, and overcomplicated storytelling. (I know, there were some jokes and references to the previous films also.) Emily Clarke was hot, but it wasn't a great fit for this role.

928,Jerry_Garner,A Terminator for the Avengers crowd.,6,3 July 2015,"The first thing I noticed that the tone didn't compare to the first two Terminators. In fact, it felt like they used a script from a random action movie and integrated the basic Terminator elements. Overall, I would describe this movie as a ""laugh a minute, action filled ride"".Seriously, it was like watching the banter between Tony Stark and Captain American. I realize a little humor is alright, but they really pushed it over the edge here.Additionally, there was no point where I found myself on the edge of my seat like I did when first seeing the original two. Even a scene with an exchange between Kyle and Sarah, which could have been downright emotional, was laughable - literally, Kyle is smirking during the story of Sarahs parents. The acting didn't bother me at first. Arnold wasn't all that bad, but nowhere as good as T2. I've never been a fan of Jai Courtney, and thought he did well in a few scenes, but overall he was nowhere close to the performance of Michael Biehn. Understanding she grew updifferently, I gave the performance of Sarah Connor a pass. I'd be interested in seeing how this would have turned out with a different tone.Lastly, the music was silly, which went with some silly scenes. The only issue here is the Terminator should to be silly. The Cops theme after the arrest and the Ramones (?) during the out of place Terminator and Reese clip filling competition were embarrassing. The classic ""dun dun dun dun dun"" sounds from the theme was played at the corniest times! If nothing else this movie makes me appreciate the first two films so much more. I can now rest knowing that there will never be films like there used to be and just enjoy what was.",Terminator Genisys

After seeing it, I'm surprised that so many people dislike this movie. It's actually very entertaining and it certainly doesn't deserve the level of criticism aimed at it. This is coming from someone who watched the first two Terminator films three weeks ago in anticipation of this movie. Maybe the problem is that many viewers are so emotionally attached to this franchise and have high expectations and standards for this movie. There's nothing wrong with that, but if you go watch this movie with that mindset then you will be disappointed. I don't think this is a movie that takes itself very seriously. It's just good harmless fun. The problem is this movie markets itself as the third true sequel of the early Terminator films, so it's not unreasonable to expect it to be on the same level as the other two. It's not, but I don't care. I really liked it.",Terminator Genisys
930,shauncox38,A Shell of its former self,4,5 July 2015,"Despite pre-release negativity, I was willing to give the film a chance, perhaps it was the nostalgic love for the first two entries in the series with a hope this would somehow recapture some of it. I was wrong. Terminator Genisys is a soulless, lacklustre film with terrible pacing, uncharismatic characters and a story completely devoid of pacing or excitement. Without going too much into spoiler territory, the revisiting of settings from previous films that the filmmakers were hoping would ignite enthusiasm from long term fans completely fail to deliver and perhaps slightly tarnish the Cameron era and what it provided. A Terminator film should have the audience on edge, a feeling of excitement or a sense of dread about what could possibly happen next and Genisys is totally lacking in this department. Even the supposedly exciting action set pieces are mundane and not at all helped by some pretty blatant and at times poorly executed CGI and a disappointingly soulless and boring score that cannot begin to match the work of Brad Fiedel. The film tries to be respectful and pay homage to previous entries in the series (well the James Cameron films anyway without actually knowing and understanding what made them such a success in the first place and why they are so well revered after all this time.Genisys is a another prime example of a studio hoping to make profit on a franchise beloved by millions and not grasping what actually makes it beloved, with the suspected belief that the franchise name alone would be enough to draw fans in.

I like recreations of the old scenes and John Connor is well cast.But that's the problem, the movie beats you over the head with the nostalgia and tries to re-write the story from the previous films while adding tons of new elements. It is too much to get your head around. Even as a fan of time travel films this timeline makes no sense and the plot gets too wrapped up in all the possible timelines and dates that there is no room for characters to breathe. What was so good about T1 and T2 is that the future is a mysterious, over-arching story and serves as a set up to the film in which we explore a few key characters, within one time period. In Genisys, we jump between multiple timelines and the characters don't even have a clue whats going on. Apart from Arnie who is suddenly an expert on time travel and awkwardly explains it to them all time. I think its more down to writing than performance but Sarah Connor is so off in this film. Not only is she nothing like the original character, she has all the awkward ""bad ass"" lines that are poorly delivered and the chemistry between her and Kyle Reese is non- existent. There is at least one scene where their lines don't even sound line they're speaking to each other, or even acting in the same scene.Sorry this is a bit of a rant.

935,doom-oculta,A decent Sunday evening movie,6,13 July 2015,"1st of all i will count out T1 and T2 from this little topic because those 2 masterpieces won't get the sequel that they deserved.As a Terminator fan i can say that TG was a movie with so much potential but kinda failed a little. I have to say that long time ago there were some rumors about Edward Furlong as John Connor and Linda Hamilton as Sarah + Arnie as T-800. Maybe the impact of these actors would be really great but anyway. The movie is OK-ish for a Sunday evening chill with your friends. The CGI is great overall but the plot is a little...OK a little more understandable with a bunch of plot-holes....man plot-holes. Maybe it's a lead to a sequel (hope not). I was excited to see one of my favourite actors from childhood, Arnie, back as T-800. I don't get all the hate against Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese. OK, it wasn't like Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese but that is because the producers changed the character. So i think he did a good job. On the other hand i couldn't see Emilia Clarke as Sarah. She is a good actress but something missed about her in this movie...and i am not talking about the dragons! She had moments when she was awesome and moments when she was...insecure about the role i guess? Jason Clarke played OK-ish his role as John Connor. Anyway overall it was a decent movie, the real sad part is that it had SO MUCH potential. Another thing is that even you will get lost in time travel stuff and plot holes the movie is predictable and that's again a big minus!Tho is not a great movie, i recommend it for a bit of nostalgia.

I'm honestly not sure why this movie is hated so much, but honestly I really don't have any big problems with it. It delivered on action and the characters were great too. Sarah Conner was the best character I'd say. The plot had a lot of time travel, and I think it turned a lot of people off. Honestly though, it's not really confusing. Just think Back To The Future. I really hope there's a sequel and I'm especially hoping that Cameron comes back for another one. I'd love to see what he could come up with. If you're a Terminator fan, go see this.

937,wallowwear,"Despite itself, the film works",10,3 July 2015,"Being a giant fan of the first and second terminator films, I was expecting Terminator Genesys to be flat out garbage, something on par with a Michael Bay movie, but with more jokes. Thankfully that didn't happen. It ended up surprising the hell out of me because despite some things, I ended up agreeing with James Cameron that this film is a fitting ""part 3"" rather than what we got when Arnold decided star shaped glasses were a good idea.It lacks the serious tone, and atmosphere of the original, and T2, but this is fundamentally a film for the fans, written by fans. The first two films aren't coming back, but if we can accept it, we can enjoy this weird trip of expecting more from the franchise. People actually cared this time, and it shows. The acting is clunky but good enough that you feel more and more comfortable with it as the action unwinds until you can simply enjoy the ride.The interesting thing is that if you expected a plot that unfolded much like the first two, this one still works while both being out of left field and written with fistfuls of awareness as to respect the originals. Arnold is the most convincing machine, but without the dullness that Terminator 3 had. I think he exudes a certain attitude that he takes this seriously and the film benefits. Clarke is a suitable Sarah Connor, and like Jai Courtney, it'll take some time to acclimate to where you can comfortably think of them as embodying these characters. They aren't bad and we aren't getting theater quality acting, but neither of them are simply trying to get through the dialogue.Despite the corniess of the trailers the film treats its subject matter with reverence and manages to push the narrative into new territory. I think this is the one franchise that this fad of Marvel-izing works well with, because the narrative has multiple points where things can go in many different directions, and this film manages to exploit them, but it never loses the central dramatic focus.It doesn't have to be a perfect film for all of its elements to work, and it is just shy of two hours and you feel it, but this is not a McG'ing of the franchise again. I genuinely agree with James Cameron that this film is the real part three. The story is engaging, Arnold gives it an enthusiasm that was sorely missing from Terminator 3, and since the entire Terminator narrative has at its disposal time travel, we can see this as a positive branching off point for the franchise. Despite how close it might get to one of these contemporary action movies that are all flash and no substance, the film is crafted well enough that it could conceivably sit right next to parts 1, and 2 on a shelf, if physical media exists later and we allow ourselves to enjoy it.It's still gestational in a lot of ways, but this was a refreshing take on the franchise, and I swear, as a die hard fan, I was expecting a lot, lot less, but it knows what it wants, and has any number of positive options to try later as well as being immensely entertaining. We just have to let go of the idea that Terminator 1 and 2 can be redone.",Terminator Genisys

The cast was great, the CGI was great, the plot was alright and done well. There was many time lines and locations making this movie a roll-coaster for showing the plot.I give a high score because it brought back great material from the old good Terminator movies. Then brought them back to life in a new quite simple plot that looked great, was told well, performed well and made well.Arnold, seeing him old as the terminator was cool. But seeing him as the young terminator and at different ages was even cooler haha. Emelia Clarke, I don't like Game of Thrones much she was great in this movie as Sarah Connor. Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese was awesome I don't think I seen him before. But he did well as the soldier who went back in time to protect Sarah Connor.",Terminator Genisys
939,jonathan2910,"Lovely movie, great script, great actors and a great sequel",10,27 June 2015,"to start of i would like to say its my first review and i hope it will be good and informative.First of i think its a overall great movie and in my opinion it should have been T4 but whatever now vi got it. The movie takes the time travel even deeper and more mind blowing, but they tie up all the loose ends.The story of The guardian (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was a nice and elegant way of bringing him back and makes sense. i really like what they did to make him feel well placed and kinda funny at the same time.Likewise was it great to see Sarah Conner (Emilia Clarke) from a different angle, more as the combat trained Sarah Conner. Overall Emilia Clarke did a good job with this role and i really hope she return for the next one.Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) was portrayed nice and again i liked the backstory of him, especially the messed up time line, around him. Jai did a OK job not the best not the worst.The plot it self i would say is very well done, it makes it not feel like a reboot and more like a sequel. All the time travel makes this a very complicated action movie but the time line is great work so its not like you think its a big mess. Well done!:D Possible spoilersThe special effects team, hot damn they did good. This is showing us the real power of CGI in a good way. I know a lot of people complain about CGI but did we really want to see a stop motion Terminator battle, we would never had have the Arnold Vs Arnold fight never had the time travel, never had the T-1000. i think that CGI in this movie was really great and people need to stop judging a movie on the special effects.Spoiler alert!!!The twist with John Conner was very good and well worked around. As twisting him around as the villain was a good idea, but whoever made trailer need to learn not to spoil the plot.",Terminator Genisys
940,zhzexi,"great song, good story",10,6 July 2015,"Half of the reason to see this movie was Jane's song. Definitely did not let me down. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Emilia Clark did well, Kyle Resse does not have too much existence. John Connor was good.I especially liked the part that AS was kinda like the father of Sarah Connor. Also, the flip character design of John Connor is smart. Jane's song invited big Sean and the use of electrified voice is a good choice. The fight between the young and old AS was good too. The Korean liquid metal terminator performed fairly well.I am a fan of Jane Zhang and the first of the series of terminator was released in 1984, the same year that she was born.",Terminator Genisys
941,acconspiracies,Should I be ashamed for LOVING THIS!,10,25 June 2015,"I am a massive Terminator 1 and 2 fan, I disliked 3 and 4 a lot and I really thought this would be terrible as well! However I turned out to be wrong! Dead Wrong! This film has the best Arnold character of them all! He is the most 'human' towards Sarah and I really loved that connection, I can see many people liking it also. It was reminiscent of John Connor and Arnold from T2 which I just saw today... I remember seeing the first trailer and having many problems. I thought the story line was too complicated and wasn't respectful of the older films and I thought the visuals were bad. I was wrong in both cases. The story pays massive respect to James Camerons first two classics! And it wasn't complicated for me. It was a fun story and kept my eyes on the screen. Also the visuals... wow the visuals... I know people said that we will never be shocked again by visuals like we were in T2 and the first Jurassic Park! But the young T800 looks too good to ignore. Wow! The best animation I've ever seen, I can't see the difference between him and the real one. This is a fun, humorous, emotional action flick that shouldn't be ignored! I loved it! And you know what, I'm not ashamed! Alan Taylor deserves praise! P.S. I love the soundtrack, I hand it to Lorne Balfe who I know makes great soundtracks from Assassins creed!",Terminator Genisys
942,losangeles212003,The best Terminator movie made!,10,30 June 2015,"I am not sure if these negative reviews are for Terminator 3, but Terminator Genisys was an awesome! I am not sure what more you could expect from this movie, but to us it was hands down the best sequel. The actors did great and it turned out to be a worthy plot. Arnold is back and just as epic as T1 and T2! Emilia Clarke is such a great fit to play Sarah. The action throughout the film was good and we had also some great laughs. We watched it in IMAX and the graphics were amazing. Don't listen to these negative reviews, I actually read them before and didn't think the movie would be nearly as good as it turned out to be. I would highly recommend watching this in IMAX. If you're a fan of T1 and T2, I really don't understand how you couldn't enjoy this flick.",Terminator Genisys
943,WaightZer,Unexpected satisfaction,9,25 June 2015,"Because of the previous entries (yes, T-X, bale/worthington), I walked in with below average expectations. This movie proved me wrong and fully entertained me. After 15-20 minutes into the film, I disabled my nickpicking nature and enjoyed the movie. Love the old score, cheesy one liners, Schwarzenegger, T-800-101, Sarah Cornor and hardcore robo brawls. Full of Nostalgia in 1984 scenes. Whether you're a old time terminator fans or casual movie goer, chances are, you'll enjoy this. For me its well worth every single pennies. Even though I said I disabled, here are some that makes me cringe. - why does T-1000 has an ccent. - why/how sarah and T-800 waited/get away 11 years from/to terminated T-1000 and when they do, its seems a bit simple and easy. - after T-800 gets and poly-alloy, why does he still looks aged. (nevermind, real Arnold is way better than CGI younger arnold).Anyway, I enjoyed and loved the movie, I gave it 9/10.",Terminator Genisys

946,ionut-neicu,Fair but not so good.,5,23 July 2015,"I saw this movie on cinema and as I am a big fan of Terminator2 I must say that my expectations were set quite low. Most sequels are big disappointments and for movies like this, I expected a predictable poor scenario and focus on special effects. Scenario was a little surprising in the first part of the movie and this is the only reason to watch this movie. But the characters are so diluted. The good Arnie is now old, the bad guy now even stronger than T1000, but who the heck is now-days surprised by him healing, melting, re-assembling and getting out of the flames ?But at the end I realized that I watched this movie so detached, no surprise, no emotion at all and, if I look back to T2 and its special effects made in '90s I can say that the Genesys's effects are anything but special.",Terminator Genisys

948,tommy_tanner123,"As a huge Terminator fan, I wanted to love it but it fell short on many occasions",6,12 July 2015,"I seriously wanted to love this movie, The Terminator is one of my all time favourite films, T2 not far behind. So I ignored all the negative comments towards the film because it was obvious from day one that this film was going to receive heavy criticism, especially after the last two installments (although I enjoy T4). But sadly, this movie fell short and ultimately let me down. There were far too many moments of comedy for a Terminator film, which made it feel more like a parody movie than a serious Sci-fi thriller. I began praying that every scene Arnie was in wouldn't contain a silly one liner or comedic moment, because they used way too many of those. Of course T2 was known for its comedic moments, but it was in small doses and didn't take the seriousness away from the plot. It gave the film some real heart. But I feel that this could have been a wonderful film if it contained much less comedy and had a stronger script. The lack of violence and language really made it hard to connect to the film, it really didn't feel like a Terminator movie at all. It is without a doubt the weakest installment in the franchise. The PG-13 rating definitely didn't help the film at all. Lets not forget the terrible marketing which gave almost every plot point away.I feel that Sarah and Kyle were terribly miscast and the connection between the two characters felt forced. Jason Clarke on the other hand did a wonderful job as John Connor but towards the end of the film after his transformation, his character became dull and a little hard to believe. The movie's score was average at best, a few really decent soundtracks but there was a lot, and I mean a lot of generic chase scene kind of music that you will hear in a lot of movies. The Terminator franchise is known for it's fantastic score so it was a real let down. The CGI in my opinion should have been a lot better. It looked very cartoony at times and just wasn't believable at all. The actions scenes were not overly impressive and often felt too short. The stunts were well done but not overly memorable.A couple of positive things I will mention about the film are the throw backs to the original movie. There were a lot of shot for shot recreations of scenes and unchanged dialogue from the original which was really great to see, but it felt at times that the film relied on that for nostalgia purposes rather than trying to make its own film. It's kind of sad that the best parts of the film were parts that have already been made, but have slightly changed circumstances. The plot was actually very good, the alternate/changed time line. It was a cool and very refreshing idea. Another plus point was Matt Smith's character. He seemed genuinely believable and was well acted. The T-1000 was awesome, definitely had Robert Patrick from T2 feels about him. Arnold and Sarah's connection had quite a bit of a good chemistry, but was often ruined by bad dialogue and comedic moments. But all of above fell short in some way whether it be bad dialogue, lack of screen time or whatever. Of course it was wonderful to see Arnold back as the Terminator, but he was no where near as good as he should have been. He felt almost too human to be a cyborg who kills. As I mentioned above, he had too many comedic moments.Overall I give this film a 6/10. It should have been a lot better and I hope the sequels improve the franchise.",Terminator Genisys
949,TheReverendSoleil,If You're Thinking About Seeing This Film...,1,2 July 2015,"...lie down until the feeling goes away!Or better yet, go rent the first three Terminator movies, watching only the cool action moments and immediately fast-forwarding past every scene where anyone demonstrates anything resembling personality or acting ability. Because really, that's all this movie ever does.Seriously -- over and over again, every time sometime cool or interesting happens in this movie, a moment's thought will remind you that they're simply apeing a scene or shot from a prior film, and did it better with technology from a quarter-century ago! Hell -- they even stole the ""quantum frequency matter"" bit from Jim Cameron's treatment for his proposed (but never filmed) version of ""Terminator 3""!Add to that the neutering the film underwent in order to squeak into a PG-13 rating, plus handing key roles in the story to the complete charisma-vacuums that are Jason Clarke and Jai Courtney (how do you even pronounce that -- does it rhyme with ""die"", or with ""oy vey""?), and it becomes clear that the real disaster that we need to invent a time machine so that we can prevent it from ever happening, is this abomination on celluloid...",Terminator Genisys
950,fatcats-955-961162,Why so much hate? I enjoyed it!,8,1 August 2018,"I know it's not a huge favorite but no idea so much hate was being given to this movie. 
I loved the redux of a familiar and well loved plot of the original Terminator being twisted after several scenes completely the same. We get to see a little more backstory of future John Connor and Kyle Reese. We see the events leading up to the tactical time machine weapon being used. 
And while no one can ever replace the original actors portraying the characters, I feel like this new version of the movie series represents the heart of the series haunting refrain: the future is not set. This could be one of the many potential futures triggered by time travel. Arnold reprises his titular character. His character in his original youth - cgi special effects looking both plastic and odd but also fitting his robotic character. In a scene where we all know and love to see the 80's punks getting their butts beat up and killed, we see it interrupted by a much older, and grayer, Arnold. The younger plastic Arnold attacks, and we enjoy a fight between them.Later we see Kyle Reeces arrival and what starts out faithfully recreated also contains a new twist. Finally after a near death experience and a rescue, the plot is tweaked again, and we discover the rescuer is none other than Sarah Connor. I don't want to keep giving way the plot, so will only say that events and plot develop into an exciting movie. Give this a shot. Don't expect it to be a faithful and complete scene for scene recreation of the movie. And I'm thankful for that. I didn't want another remake but I think for this series with time travel being an integral part of the mythos that it makes sense. Great acting, decent writing and dialogue and limited exposition along with strong special effects support the plot. While many hate this movie, I applaud it. 
Is it perfect? Oh no. Never that. 
But. It's solid. And enjoyable. And I'm looking forward to this new version and future movies with same characters returning to delight me.",Terminator Genisys
951,timbuck1970,Better than expected,8,8 July 2015,"The way I went into watching this movie was I basically had to scrap everything I already knew about the franchise and approach it the way the youth of today would. By doing this I was able to lower my expectations of how it lives up to the rest. The writing was great because they were able to twist the plot a bit and keep the integrity of the story line moving. Action sequences are a bit more CGI but hey, this is 2015 right? All in all I give it 8 out of 10 simply because without Cameron involved being that it is HIS product, there's really not much more you can do with it. Again, if you go into the theater watching it as if there were no others to compare to, you'll dig it.",Terminator Genisys

Don't listen to the nay-sayers, if you like Arnie, GO SEE IT! They throw in twists and turns with the timeline theories,which keeps it interesting and makes you think. Arnold has TONS of one-liners that are funny as hell! He even gets 'upgraded' which he has needed and deserved all these years! When you see Arnold fighting Arnold, what could be better? Classic sci- fi battle of good versus evil! Even though it was a 2 hour movie, it moves along quickly and was very enjoyable to watch.",Terminator Genisys

In terms of characters, Sarah and Reece were good choices.I've seen all the movies, and the TV show.Lets look at some reviews from professionals.""Sight & Sound - But by 2015 that excitement has long since flatlined. As with so much contemporary culture, Terminator Genisys feels simultaneously self-satisfied and desperate, frenzied and boring.

955,aaronanimated,"Call this Terminator 3b, because that's exactly what it is. Flawed, but good and here's why...",7,20 July 2015,"OK, this is coming from a HUGE fan of the Terminator franchise, and I am a writer myself, so this comes from that perspective. Just saw it a second time, and here's what I think. WARNING SPOILERS BELOW:We've reached the point where it's time to have fun with many of the ideas that the Terminator universe has introduced to us, and that's exactly what this film is. My good, bad, and ugly:1) The bad first. The biggest issue I had with T:G is the casting. The first time I saw it, I thought Jason Clark was the worst miscast, but the second time it was VERY clear that the weakest link was by FAR Jai Courtney. You put an A-list actor in this role, and it changes the entire film. The story was there, but Courtney proved he belongs in teen fare like Twilight or The Maze Runner or something along those lines. There were also a few plot holes, but most of them were minor (well, except for why they waited all those years for the T-800 processor when they could have used ""Pops'"" chip, but I digress...). Also, why oh WHY not bring back Joe Morton as Miles Dyson? His presence in a scene or two would have lent SO much gravitas to this film.2) The good. As this is going to be a new trilogy along a new Terminator, I liked the idea of merging Skynet's consciousness into a single character, who will obviously serve as the main antagonist for the trilogy. Also, many people had issue with John Connor being turned into this film's main villain, but it's more IN SERVICE to the fans, rather than the opposite. They could have very easily just killed John off, and made another person the vessel for the new nanobot killer. But why not use John for that role? It makes him relevant, and beyond that, I think there was something more at play there. There are at least two scenes where he wanted to have Sarah and Kyle join him, similar to Star Wars where Vader wants Luke to join the dark side. I think John is now a sort of Vader/Smith from Matrix hybrid, recognizing that the trio (John/Sarah/Kyle) are ""marooned in time"", and inevitably connected. It's a cool play off of the central ideas of the franchise, where now it's from Reese's perspective. Finally, what really works well (especially on second viewing) is the idea of Arnold as the ""father"" figure to Sarah. Made perfect sense to recast him in this role, and I thought it worked well. 3) The Ugly. The acting. Courtney's performance was really really bad. He's just not a great actor. You can see it when he doesn't hold his own in scenes with Jason Clarke, and there is little chemistry needed for pivotal scenes. I blame performance more than writing. Second weakest was (surprisingly) Emilia Clarke, for as much as I love her in Game of Thrones, perhaps showed her limitations. I get why casting is a political game, and name recognition will help sell tickets, but Sarah Connor at this age could have used a bit more grit. However, she suffers from comparisons to the great Linda Hamilton, who was absolutely perfect in T2, and in Clarke's favor, this IS a younger Sarah than that fierce T2 dynamo, so she'd be a bit more conditioned from an early age and less affected by the outside world to be as conflicted/intense. Arnold was solid, and Matt Smith was menacing in rare appearances as Skynet embodied. Finally, JK Simmons was a scene stealer, and will clearly play a bigger role as the trilogy continues.Overall, a fun take on the franchise. It does not work as a standalone film, but as an entry into an existing franchise, it lets us see things we've never scene before (the final attack on the Machines, the time machine, etc). It is a 7, but could have been a 9 with better acting and a stronger, more on point cast. Forget the critics, go see it and judge for yourself.",Terminator Genisys
956,stupotty123,Absolutely stupid and pointless,3,19 September 2015,Fans of the first 2 movies should avoid this title for me the worst of the franchise too many people have got hold of the terminator franchise since James Cameron and totally missed the point of terminator and this is the latest example a plot totally messed up and flawed at best Arnold's terminator character is used in this as mainly a comedy character which is totally insulting to fans of the original 2 films even 3 did a better job with the character the timeline is totally messed up Sarah Connor was OK in places but Kyle Reece who should have been one of the main parts of this film is played out to be a bit of a wimp maybe it would have helped if the main plot twist of the film would not have been revealed in the trailer but overall this is another terminator film that's so forgettable.,Terminator Genisys
957,ryanwhat9,"The critics have it wrong, on this one.",7,1 July 2015,"The key to enjoying and appreciating Terminator: Genisys, is to completely remove all expectation before going into it. After having gone into Terminator 3 & Terminator: Salvation with imagery of them living up to the classic original, or the iconic sequel, I've long learned my lesson.I saw a large budget, and a mediocre cast. Any expectation I may have reserved for this film, was... low, to say the least. And it helped. For the first time since Terminator 2, I left without a sour taste in my mouth. And herein lies why the critics have got it wrong: They're expecting a classic, rather than your average blow-shyt-up blockbuster of modern Hollywood.The movie is flawed. Far from excellent in any single category. But for many, it'll aptly fill the void of seeing Arnold in his natural on-screen environment. It'll provide a few cheap laughs, a bit of adrenaline, and conjure some nostalgic images.Holding a Terminator film to the standard of the original, or sequel, is unfair. In an era where ""blockbusters"" need to have their ~150-200m budgets filled with bright color palettes, an abuse of CGI, and need to appeal to the broadest audience possible (PG-13), I'm not sure even James Cameron himself could deliver an adequate product.The critics have it wrong. They have it wrong because they went in with expectations and standards that simply can't be lived up to. It's a decent movie, and it's worth your 20 dollars. For those who've had to live through Terminator 3 and Terminator: Salvation, it should be fairly enjoyable.Clear your slate of expectation. Go in fresh.",Terminator Genisys
958,dlovric11,It wasn't so great!!,7,6 July 2015,"The Nostalgia: As an avid (rabid...) fan of the first two movies, and having re-watched them (yet again) shortly before seeing Genisys, I was expecting and consequently looking for references to the first two films. They were plentiful, and many were subtle. Some major events, such as the scene in the trailer where Sarah rescues Kyle Reese and the old T-800 versus the new T-800 were obviously not subtle. But they were awesome to watch, to remember those moments from T1 and see how they've changed their path due to more time traveling events since T2. The less subtle ones were enjoyable as well, however. And I don't think the average watcher of Genisys will catch even half of the subtler ones (such as a thumbs up from the old T-800 to Sarah Connor-- this is the last thing she saw of the Arnold's T2 character, as he was lowered into the steal; as well as throwbacks to T2's Terminator arm. The story: This is easily the best plot from a Terminator movie since T2. It twists and turns but never leaves you confused. It's extremely creative, extremely engaging, and just good writing. I never felt like it was juggling too many things at once. The pacing was not only perfect, but the sequences played out very much like the Terminator movie it is. You can easily compare T1 and T2 (even T3's) structure to T5's structure, which helps with that nostalgia and with giving you the same feelings of tenseness, curiosity, awe, and appreciation for the cleverness as when you watched the first two. Though, of course, T1 and T2 are superior films, no matter how engaging Genisys is. But I expected that. The time travel twist when Kyle goes back, what he sees, how that affects the path of this movie, was done very well, leading to unexpected turns in the plot. The actors' chemistry with each other all worked out very well, though Arnold is the obvious standout and draw. Action and FX: Top notch for the most part. There was one scene with a Hunter-Killer (future helicopter things you see in all Terminator films) that was very obviously CGI. The Young Terminator CGI was seamless. The entire Terminator series is well-known for its practical (real-world, non-CGI) effects, and T5 delivers on that as well as any of the movies in the franchise. Some of the critics mentioned there were no memorable set pieces in the film. After watching T5, I have to wonder whether those critics watched the same movie I did. There were several memorable set pieces, environments that were essentially a 'character' within the film. This was true of T1 and T2, obviously: the Tech Noir night club (Sarah's first encounter with the two time travelers), the CyberDyne building and the steel mill in T2, and many I won't list here. But T5 had set pieces that were just as memorable. People gasped several times at how the action played out in these environments. Humor: I think this movie had a little less humor than T2, though more than T1. There weren't really any hugely stand-out lines (besides the ones we've all come to expect), though ""I've been waiting for you"" is very satisfying to hear, and ""Old, not obsolete"" line was implemented well. Much of the comedy comes from Arnold's T- 800 portrayal as he struggles to seem more human, which was, of course, the well the humor in T2 pulled on so successfully. 3D: I watched it in 3D, and I and those that went with me enjoyed it as well. I was glad to have experienced my first 3D Terminator film, that it was done well. Dialogue/script: Not perfect, but nowhere near as campy as T3. T5 takes itself seriously, unlike T3. T1 and T2 are better than T5, and I think that's largely because they were exactly what Cameron intended them to. The twists were great, the storyline was great. They leave a couple things hanging, hoping this movie is a success and there will be two more. I'd honestly be happy with it ending here. Things were wrapped up very nicely besides some minor cliffhangers, sort of the way T2 ends on a dark road and an unknown future. Verdict: I need to re-watch this film to decide exactly how it stacks up to T1 and T2. It was a fun thrill ride with some really interesting plot points that really furthered the Terminator narrative in a way that T3 and T4 never came close to achieving. For reference, I would give T1 a 9.5 (mostly due to limitations in technology in 1984), T2 a 10, T3 a 6, and Salvation a 5. If I had to take a guess on this one without a repeat viewing, I'd give it between an 8.5 and a 9 (I shamelessly gave it a 10 here after seeing 6.2 average). It was better than I expected after the weak critical reviews. It surprised me, it made me smile, laugh, sit on the edge of my seat, root for the heroes while trying to understand the opposition. The film paid great homage to the first two without leaving the audience feeling like T1 and T2 weren't important due to the changes made in the timeliness of T5. If there's a sequel... well, I'll be back. Though, the future is not set. No fate but what we make.",Terminator Genisys
959,bboop_kv,Loved it!,10,24 September 2015,"I really loved the way they seamlessly tied this in with the first two movies. The visuals were outstanding! The old T100 looked exactly as the original! Arnold's portrayal of this T800 was wonderful. The interactions between he and Sarah made for a great emotional basis for their relationship. I loved Michael Biehn's portrayal of Kyle Reese in the first film and was afraid of being disappointed in Jai Courtney's reprisal of the role (though I am a fan of him as well) but was pleasantly surprised by it. I did think it was a bit of a slip up when they failed to explain how the T1000 was able to time travel back to 1984 since he is not metal encased in living flesh but it was too minor of a mistake to bother me much. I look forward to the next installment, especially if this is any indication of the direction they are going.",Terminator Genisys

Good movie for entertainment...does have flaws..actually a lot of flaws. Arnold was great.. Kyle Reese should've given a little more performance character wise. John corner's villain twist should've been avoided as a marketing giveaway.Background music wasn't upto the mark but was alright. Story was good and a fresh one too. This movie is an entertaining movie....can't compare to James cameron's T1 and T2. High-tense was missing in action sequences.

961,MuxMasterman,Terminator Genisys quick review (Spoilers!),7,3 August 2015,"Well, so I finally got around to watching this film. And what can I say. I thought it was a very solid action flick.The plot of the movie is a bit of a mess, but it served it's purpose. It had some great sometimes spectacular action sequences and the sfx were pretty good, despite what some people say. Sure it had some misses, but overall the quality of the effects was fine. It had some nice humour and at least for me they didn't overdo it. Although I can understand how some people might disagree with me here. The acting was alright, with Arnolds performance really standing out. It is evident, that he had a lot of fun doing it and I think he gave a great performance. I was positively surprised that I was OK with Jai Courtney's acting.I absolutely loved the beginning, revisiting the original Terminator. I agree with Cameron's statement, that the movie treated those sequences with a lot of respect while still giving it it's own twist. And, as stated above, throughout the movie there are some very cool action sequences. The big showdown at cyberdyne HQ unfortunately wasn't as good and felt a bit anticlimactic, especially after the spectacular Helicopter chase just before that. The whole John Connor as villain T3000 thing didn't completely resonate with me either, but it didn't tarnish my overall enjoyment of the movie.And finally to get to the big elephant in the room: The rating. A lot has been talked about it, and yes, I would have preferred an R rating as well. But seeing how a lot of the violence in the movie is machine on machine it actually worked out. I didn't really mind that much to be honest. People who expect a movie with a similar dark tone as the original 1984 Terminator, even using some horror elements will be thoroughly disappointed though. Terminator in 2015 is not a scifi-horror-thriller anymore but a scifi-action-franchise. Some people might not like that fact, but really, this development already began with the fantastic T2.In the end it turned out pretty much the way I was expecting and I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. Is it as good as Terminator or Terminator 2: Judgement Day? No it isn't, but it is easily the best entry in the franchise since T2. If you go see it with the right mindset, that is not expecting a very gritty dark scifi horror thriller like T1 but a fun action flick with characters we all remember and love, you should have a good time. It is a good movie, not great, but good. 7.5/10",Terminator Genisys

The Terminator/Guardian) is back, and this time he has some new friends (some of them are familiar, and some of them are quite new). He adopted Sarah Connor ever since that she was little, and he was like a father to her.Now with a new character (T-3000) appearing in the film, new replacement actors/actresses for some of the roles of the original characters in the franchise, new material appearing in the film and a veteran cast member reprising the role of the Terminator, this movie is a ""must see"" for ""Terminator"" fans.

The tension, action and the plot keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the full run time of those movies and clearly these two movies have defined the Terminator franchise and elevated the characters of Sarah Connor and T-1000 into its iconic status in the movie industry. Then came along T3 and T4 and I really think T3 is a decent movie. They should have just stopped making terminator movies after T4 because what they have achieved by Terminator Genysis is total destruction of beloved franchise.

964,Billy_Rambo,Worst Terminator so far! Seems like lame fan-fic.,3,5 July 2015,"I'm sorry, but this is bad. It's not even a guilty pleasure like T3 was. I knew it was literally impossible to surpass T1 & T2, because those are the only real canon movies by James Cameron. Pretty much everything after T2 just seems like cheesy fan-fic. They are just lazy cash-grabs by movie studios. I know its been said a million times, but the series should have ended after T2. The 2 actors that played John Connor and Kyle Reese sucked. They are horribly miscast. Michael Biehn is a legendary actor, it's almost impossible to top him. The whole lovey-dovey stuff between Sarah & Kyle was so cheesy! It looks straight out a cliché Disney movie, UGH! What the hell is that doing in a Terminator movie? The movie in general is really cheesy. I cringed SO HARD when the Bad Boys song started playing when they went to jail! -_- Is this a Micheal Bay movie now? Whats next? 2 Black gangster Terminators that speak with slang? UGH! My GOD! That was stupid and does NOT belong in a Terminator movie, unless its crappy fan-fic! That's pretty much what this movie is anyway. The movie is just too light-hearted & goofy. It doesn't have that real serious authentic feel of the first 2 movies. You actually feel suspense in the first 2 movies, but you feel absolutely zero suspense in Genisys, because it feels like a goofy cartoon. I know the movie studios dumb down things to appeal to the more mainstream in order to make more money, hence the PG-13 rating, but still! T2 did very well at the box-office and wasn't stupid & dumbed-down like this. Arnold was just OK! This was the worst he has been in a Terminator movie. His lines seem a little forced this time around. Arnold was still the best actor in the movie, but that is very bad, considering he plays an emotionless robot. Negatives aside, I still thought the relationship between the Arnie and Sarah was a little cute, but that was the only little tiny positive in this movie. That was not nearly enough to save the movie. The action scenes are also the worst out of the movies, BY FAR! The whole bridge chase scene with the school bus was SUPER underwhelming, barely anything really happens. Even T3 has an EPIC chase of Arnie dangling from a crane and crashing through buildings! Then he drops the truck's hook into a manhole and flips the entire truck over! That was HARDCORE!!! T3 wasn't good critically, but it still had AMAZING action!!! Genisys sucks! It has underwhelming action and overuse of CG, but I already expected that because it's 2015. So there is not a lot of redeeming qualities I can think about for this film. It's just really bad. It has a half-*ssed nonsensical plot thats all over the place. It seems like very lame fan-fic. I can't understand how anyone can enjoy this movie. I still feel like even the lowest common denominator would find this movie boring and forgettable. Everyone still remembers the first 2 movies because they are classics and unforgettable, but no one will remember Genisys in about 2 months from now because it is very forgettable. You still might enjoy Genisys if you enjoy the Resident Evil movies though.(LOL!)PS - Note to the movie studios. Please let the Terminator franchise die peacefully. Stop milking a dead cow. Have some honor! That goes for most big franchises! This needs to stop! Also, Arnie! What the hell bro!?! Why do you keep agreeing to do these horrible movies? You are already rich!!! Can't you see how bad the movie is just by looking at the script and screenplay, etc.? So why do you keep agreeing to do this Arnie? You should only come back to the Terminator franchise if James Cameron does.",Terminator Genisys

I really enjoyed the 1st and the 2nd, 3rd and the 4th of felt a little jarring, and the fifth liked, but it was a mixture of disappointment and taste (something like a guilty pleasure). Arnold, JK Simmons and Lee Byung-hun save the essence of the film. Emilia Clarke she does not do so bad the role (Physically would have some resemblance to a teenager Linda Hamilton), but left things to be desired. and the rest, as half and fa.

967,redheadshesaid,Loved it!,10,30 June 2015,"I don't want to give anything away but this was a great movie. Huge fan of the Terminator movies and love how this plays so well with the original movie. I had a hard time following all of the time travel and still have a few questions but it really doesn't matter. Arnold was perfection in this role and the rest weren't bad either. The special effects have raised the bar in the action movie genre - just like the original and T2 did back in the day. It's a great movie. It's important to have seen the first one in the series, as a stand alone movie it's still got awesome special effects but without knowing the back story it probably isn't as much fun.",Terminator Genisys
968,Switchbox,Decent Story/Lacks Character,6,6 July 2015,"While I thought the story was fresh and original, it definitely suffered from not having the original actors in their original roles.The previous movies had given us these rich characters that we know and love and now this movie gives us the chance to see them all again in a different set of circumstances interacting with each other with new developments to their personalities (e.g. Kyle is now seeing strong Sarah and a ""good"" Terminator like in T2) but it falls a bit flat because these aren't the ones who gave us the great performances earlier. I don't mind Emilia Clarke as Sarah, but her conversations with Kyle, which we haven't seen since T1, just didn't pack the same dramatic impact as it could have since it wasn't Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn sharing the screen.Yes, I understand that they are much older now and it would have been hard to use them, but that seemed to be the big miss-step with this movie. I will say, that the future action scenes were cool to see. It looked more dark and eerie like the way we have seen it in the flash forwards from T1 and T2, which is a stark contrast to the not-as-bleak, bright future we got in Terminator Salvation. And the homage we get of T1 with an almost shot-for-shot recreation of the arrival scene of the original Terminator was really neat seeing on the big screen.All in all, this movie did a great job in terms of story progression and character arc with the new batch of actors. I just think it lacks ""character"" in such that we don't see our original thespians playing the characters that we know and love.",Terminator Genisys
969,zeyaya,"One of my favourite movies, you do not want to miss it",8,4 July 2015,"After two hours having my brain blown away during this movie, I got out thinking 'I can't wait to see what happens next'. This movie's script/story is probably the most complicated and intriguing one in theatres right now, I congratulate the writers on being able to create something original and new while respecting the original films, if not all of them. It was also very satisfying to see Arnold take back his legendary role as the TERMINATOR. And finally the locations of this movie are amazing, the shots are wide and open, allowing you to experience Los Angeles in a a very unique way. Even with all these great qualities, I do not think the world is ready to fully enjoy this movie, and that is probably why we will not see the 6th instalment of the TERMINATOR franchise.",Terminator Genisys

971,nmcomicbooks,I don't know if the negative reviews saw the same film. This was fantastic!,10,2 July 2015,"I'm a fairly hardcore fan of Terminator. I've seen all 4 previous movies and have noticed their decline in quality over the years. The first one was pretty good, but watching it now just doesn't feel the same. The second one is a masterpiece, despite John Connor as a child being slightly annoying at times. The third one isn't nearly as good as the first two, but I found it to be a decent movie. Terminator Salvation was and still is the worst in the series, because it was, of course, really bad. Now here we are, a new Terminator movie is out, and it's being torn apart by critics. Let's start with the good: Jai Courtney plays a good Kyle Reese and captures the seriousness and confusion of the original character.Emilia Clarke was pretty good in the movie, but didn't really sell me as Linda Hamilton from T2. She had the reactions down perfectly and gave a good performance, so I can overlook the fact that she doesn't sell me as Sarah Connor from the first two movies.Arnold Schwarzenegger was once again great as the T-800. Need I say more?J. K. Simmons was in this film for a short time, but I enjoyed every minute he was on- screen.The plot actually made more sense than what I thought would based off what I saw in the trailer. I actually made sense and put a clever spin on the classic Terminator vs. John Connor story.The pacing was actually pretty good, too. I could tell where the beginning ended and the middle began.Now the bad:The CGI at times looked a bit unfinished at times, usually when liquid was involved.Conclusion: This is a fantastic movie and you shouldn't listen to the negative reviews.",Terminator Genisys
972,hilalalsameraaii,"Good, but it leans more towards okay",6,7 September 2015,"It's an okay film. I liked the plot. However there are many plot holes in the film (and no, it had nothing to do with the time travel, my head wrapped around it easily). This doesn't effect my review too much. The performance of some of the actors wasn't that good. There are parts where Emilia Clarke is clearly acting and I don't feel much emotion in it. Jai Courtney didn't do much of a good job as Kyle Reese, his performance is bland. Matt Smith, Jason Clarke, Arnold Schwarzenegger and J.K. Simmons did a great job in their roles. One of the things that ruined this film was the spoiler revealed in the trailer. If you haven't seen Trailer #2 for this film, don't watch it. It spoils the biggest twist of the film. Another problem that I had with the film was that the characters themselves, were poorly written. Some of the stuff Sarah Connor says might seem okay when Emilia Clarke says it, but if you try and imagine Linda Hamilton speaking in that fashion, it doesn't feel right. There is one part where Sarah Connor says ""Can you not say the word 'mate' like, ever?"" and lines with similar wordings. I simply cannot think it as something that the Sarah Connor from T1 would ever say. Parts of the film wasn't written well, but the plot was still good and I really enjoyed this flick. There was one problem that I had with the plot which is that Skynet is a character, a character that looks like a human. Before this film, I saw Skynet as a very, very powerful computer but, not a terminator. The main problem is, the people who made this film new that Terminator 3 and Salvation were bad (as Terminator films) but they didn't know why and made something that sunk to the same level as an those films and don't get me wrong, the film was better than Terminator 3 and Salvation, but it comes nowhere near the first two films.",Terminator Genisys
973,zarinr,"Good graphics, strong character development, needs more thrills, can create confusion",7,30 July 2015,"I actually loved the three main characters - very strong and captivating, and the strong bonding between Sarah and Terminator is well highlighted and the spectators just can feel it. It's very emotional at the end. Arnold's 'robotic' grin was the best part of the whole movie, and I'm in love with it. Puts a comical touch to the story, and his dialog 'Old not obsolete' is just handsome. The graphics is just superb and shook me up!! Rocking. But however the story can be kinda confusion through all the time travel stuff and you have to keep reminding yourself for the thousandth time how a particular situation came up. The whirlwind of the years they pass, Kyle's memories, how he remembers the past, Jason's sudden change - all comes at a very flustering and disorganized way. I also felt a little bit - just a little bit - that this movie isn't THAT much thrilling as the previous series were. Nevertheless, the character development of the three and the graphics really paid off - great work guys! Arnold was the best!",Terminator Genisys
974,RonReda,"Could have been a lot better, unfortunately, it was not good nor memorable",3,15 August 2015,"Arnold makes the Terminator movies what they are. If he says or does something in the movie it is either remembered or forgotten. This time, he said - three times in a row - ""I'm old, not obsolete."" OK, you're old, got it. BUT YOU ARE A MACHINE, sure, learning to be human, BUT NOT HUMAN, therefore, AGE SHOULD BE OBSOLETE, NOT YOU! ALRIGHT, one time saying this OK. LET it slide. BUT THREE TIMES IN A ROW??COME ON. Then we needed more action from the nemesis, MORE ACTION FROM THE T-101 from 1984, just all-in-all more fast-flowing action and unforgettable dialogue. What we get is Hollywood saying, ""whatever"" to this latest edition of the Terminator. Sad.",Terminator Genisys
975,gabemart-04299,Genisys is great film. Don't care what others say,8,5 July 2015,"Before I watched this movie I had doubts I had heard critics say very negative things and I expected the worst. However the movie was honestly great. It is the best Terminator movie since T2.Now many people have complained about the spoilers in the trailer and yes those trailers were stupid to have to John Connor spoiler in it. However I didn't mind that much. The vague direction of where the movie was headed I knew, yes, but how they would take John as a villain, how the Guardian and Sarah was taken, I didn't know that and it was a joy watching this on film.To me the best things, because it wasn't spoiled (again this review contains spoilers) is Matt Smith's role as Skynet itself. Smith is known for drama as he clearly showed in Doctor Who and the direction the movie takes with him is fascinating. It was out of nowhere for me that you saw this evil man with John. JK Simmon's role was interesting as well but I wish that had done more with him but I guess he might show up in a sequel.That's another thing, this film is not a complete package it is part one of a trilogy and I don't mind the loose ends. Not everything needs to be resolved. The only thing that holds me back from giving a 10/10 is Jai Courtney's performance. It isn't bad but it isn't one deserving of a character such as Kyle Reese though I do believe like his relationship with Sarah Connor more because he isn't treated as a future savior. And as a final afterthought this John Connor is the best John Connor in the Terminator movies. So it is great. Not T2 great but really close to T1 with the expansiveness of T2. The directions it took added new dimensions to a dying franchise and showed us what we all loved in the old films while clearly showing that these are new films and kinda wiping the slate clean. Some say that ruins the old 2 good movies but I argue that they explore the dimensions of those movies and move forwards. Definitely is worth the watch and I will be buying it on Blu Ray if possible.",Terminator Genisys

977,badamanda,Worst film in the series yet...,5,5 July 2015,"Let's be honest from the outset: ""Terminator Genisys"" is the worst film (so far) in the cult series inaugurated by James Cameron in 1984 with the FANTASTIC ""The Terminator"", one of the best American films of the '80s, in my humble opinion.Like Bryan Singer's ""X-Men - Days Of Future Past"" and J.J. Abrams' 2009 ""Star Trek"", this fifth film in the ""Terminator"" saga (presented by its producers as the first in a new trilogy) recycles the outdated but convenient concept of time travel. The script skillfully (but excessively) multiplies ""parallel realities"" in a story that allows the film (like in ""Back To The Future - Part II"") to revisit the key scenes of the first film, this film visibly being considered the new ""Terminator 3"" by its writers because it pretends that both ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" (2003) and ""Terminator Salvation (2009) simply never happened by superceding and bypassing them in favor of this ""alternate"" reality where (spoiler alert!) John Connor (a laughable Jason Clarke who plays everything over-the-top) has now become the bad guy. Which explains the inevitable feeling of déjà- vu, amplified by action scenes and visual effects that are competent but too generic (although the sight of an entirely digital version of the 1984 Arnold Schwarzenegger is pretty impressive), HORRIBLE exploitation of 3D effects and efficient but impersonal direction, courtesy of Alan Taylor (the ""Game Of Thrones"" series, ""Thor - The Dark World"").Add to that the spectacle of an ""old, but not obsolete"" Schwarzenegger (that joke, initially funny, gets old and tedious really fast, as does Sarah Connor calling him ""Pops"" every two minutes or so) doing battle with the young (and digital) version of the character he'd played SO memorably and iconically 31 years ago in James Cameron's original classic (at least Emilia Clarke, also from ""Game Of Thrones"" - and who, this time, manages to keep her clothes on for almost the whole movie - , is TRULY excellent as Sarah Connor), and you end up with a geriatric summer blockbuster, which feels like it's REALLY past its expiration date!In short, the PERFECT metaphor of a Hollywood that can't stop regurgitating its old franchises, even when they should just let them wither away and die...",Terminator Genisys

However with John Connor being the villain I am torn. He has awesome action filled battles in the film but the scariest thing about the T1000 from T2 AND THIS FILM was that they are emotionless and show that they have no remorse when they kill. Jason Clarke doesn't really do this much, but it just didn't feel right for me.This review may seem more negative but that's just because I spoke about them more. The positives heavily outweigh the negatives and this really is a great summer blockbuster film! As a Terminator 1 and 2 fan I love this! It's better than the unmentionables...",Terminator Genisys
979,trueconspiracygamer,What A Shock!,10,25 June 2015,"This is the biggest shock of the year. I don't think anybody expected this film to be this good! The terminator franchise is very old and I admit I was one to say they should give up or just give the movie back to Cameron. But Alan Taylor proved me very wrong, this is the best terminator film I've seen in many many years!When I look at my favorite of the franchise, T2, the things that made it a huge success is the following. -Great Action -Good use of Practical and CGI -Phenomenal acting by Linda Hamilton -Fun acting by Arnold - Emotional connection with T800 and John. -Beautiful score. -scary relation to real world. Terminator Genesys has all of these qualities. It has brilliant action, great visual effects, fun acting by Arnold, greatly emotional bond with Sarah and 'Pops'. A great score that is filled with nostalgia and it does have a scary relation to the real world which I am not going to speak of more.The only thing it doesn't have that gives T2 the edge is Emilia Clarkes, Sarah Connor. Emilia was fine but the character wasn't as tortured as she was in T2 and that is part of the story and that Emilia plays more of a full on brute force, then a tortured women with emotional and physical scars.At the end of the day, if you like the first two terminator films you should watch this.

980,kassofficialmusic,An Awesome Action Movie!,10,25 June 2015,"Last week I saw the highly anticipated Jurassic World, I was expecting it to be a great movie, mainly for the fact of what I had been hearing and the fact that we had Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt, two actors I really liked. I was ultimately disappointed with the film thinking the story lacked and had absolutely terrible characters. The action however was amazing, unusually not as good as the first film but still entertaining. Terminator is a franchise I hold more dear to my heart, and I have been scared about this addition to the franchise. Although I like that Arnold is back, I was distraught to hear that Jai Courtney is playing the role of Kyle Reese... The actors overall do some good acting and even Jai Courtney did okay. The chemistry is not there though when we see the forced relationship with him and Emilia Clarkes Sarah Connor. The film starts with what we all know, the first 2/3rds of the film are absolutely incredible, I was always on the edge of my seat, with immense action scenes and emotional character moments. This is also the case because those are the parts of the film where they pay homage to the original films. Later it is still as awesome as before but the nostalgia factor kind of went.This film was really special to me, especially because of my love for the first two films. I don't just give 10/10s for films that have no flaws because this film does have flaws but they are miniscule to me and the emotional attachment I now have to this film is massive. I can't stop thinking about it! I am really excited about the upcoming movies, but I hope they are only being made for having a good script and not for money.

I wish I saw it in IMAX...initially, I was skeptical due to various things (iffy promos and trailers, 1 subpar sequel (T3) and one outright bad sequel (T4), and ? of is there anything left to tell). . That being said I was pleasantly blown away! Hasta Levista to preconceived notions: This movie delivered everything I wanted. Great special effects, moving score, and a neat script with twist to make old ideas fresh. Emilia Clarke nailed it--tough as iron but able to show nuances of sensitivity. Arnold slips right in to the role he was born to play. Jason Clarke-- guy looked like he really enjoyed himself! I wasn't too thrilled with Jai Courtney--looked the part, but something wooden about his delivery. Oh and hearing the Brad Fiedel influenced score on big screen--sublime; I felt like an 11 year old kid again. . I'm genuinely surprised that critics have been so derogatory as I loved it and I consider my taste to be fairly mainstream. This one film where I would ignore the critics, and make up your own mind.

Liked the scenes that expanded the scenes from the first movie, and Arnolds T800 humor made me laugh at least.The 3 buddies that saw it with me all gave it 10/10.I do however think that the movie would be confusing to someone who has never seen the first two movies at least. Since it played a lot on the stories, characters and humor from those two movies.Also liked that they stayed true to the Terminator-universe in both story/time line and technology shown in ""the future""-part.",Terminator Genisys
985,jonfreid,"Awesome, just awesome!",9,30 June 2015,"I don't understand all the haters. I often wonder why some people even bother going to movies. They over analyze and criticize every movie. I however love to enjoy movies at face value. I won't lie, to date no terminator movie after T2 has even come close to making me feel exited watching it the first time the way T2 did, until now.I thought this latest movie was fantastic, and I was not alone. I saw a preview screening with about 20% normal people and 80% press last night. It was obvious throughout the movie that the audience was very into the movie and at the end it got a standing ovation. What does that tell you? I could not wait for what came next.It won't surprise me a bit if half those reviewers that stood and clapped give the movie a bad review because thats what they do, or they think they are expected to do.Don't listen to reviews or the haters. Go see this movie while you can on the big screen. If you liked the first 2 movies this movie is very much more along those lines than the other sequels. Arnold being old fits great! The story is fantastic. The effects fantastic. Casting fantastic. For the first time in a long time I actually felt like I saw special effects I have not seen before.This movie deserves your attendance. Go have fun! I may go see it again this weekend.",Terminator Genisys
986,pegasussgc,A New Beginning for the Terminator Franchise,8,30 June 2015,"TLDR at bottom.I walked out of the theater pretty conflicted about this movie. I didn't hate it, I didn't love it. But I accepted it. This movie is about wiping the slate clean, no doubt about it. If you can't stand to see canon changed, do not watch this film. But if you can accept change, different takes on old stories, you will walk away having been entertained. I love Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor, she has just the right amount of cuteness and toughness. The weakest part of this movie is Jai Courtney (Kyle Reese), I just can't bring myself to like him. Arnold is the true star of this film, he really pulls off the perfect terminator performance. TLDR: This movie will ask you to change the way you think about the Terminator franchise, if you can accept that you will enjoy this movie.",Terminator Genisys
987,kram-03549,Well done movie,9,1 July 2015,"I went to see it with my son on the pre showing and initially I was in the mindset that it was going to suck like the last two....but I was very wrong! I wont spoil the movie but what I can say without ruining it for viewers is that is was wonderfully done, awesome special effects, and great acting. From beginning to end I was rooting for the resistance, and at times it appeared that all was lost. Arnold was great...regardless of his age did exactly what he was trained to do and that is Terminate. IT was a perfect blend of Terminator 1 & 2, and it made you think that you knew what would happen next, but it didn't disappoint. There is some bad language in it, but it is limited to that of the others. Remember Arnold is old, but not obsolete. I enjoyed it to the point that I cant wait to add it to my terminator collection of 1 and 2. I will pretend that that last two never happened. Take the family to see it but I would suggest watching the first two prior. I can also say that it was worth the price to finish off a great series.....meaning the first two.",Terminator Genisys
988,strifeorstripe,Great homage and an emotional roller-coaster that sets the franchise in a new direction,8,1 July 2015,"Went in with zero expectations considering the last two in the franchise (T2 is probably in my top 5 favorite movies) but I ended up being pleasantly surprised. They basically gave a middle finger of their own to T3 and T4 and tried to fit in the the original two and the ""No fate but what we make for ourselves"" idea. It paid a lot of attention to T2 where Sarah remarks that the Terminator is actually a better father than most humans and extrapolated from that idea. Although traveling forward in time? It's supposed to be one way.I thought the ""Detective O'Brien"" character was pretty funny - one of the LAPD just getting glimpses of just what the hell is going on in the Terminator universe across time but never the full story, kind of like Dr. Silverman from the first 3 movies (I've seen T2 so many times, seriously, but I only recently noticed that he's the guy interrogating Reese from the first movie).Overall it was actually pretty enjoyable and true to the best movies of the series without being too cheesy. Didn't like Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor (pretty hard to replace Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor in my view, physically and acting wise), but I liked to see Arnie get more ""human"" from being a learning computer and being around humans for a lot longer.",Terminator Genisys
989,markgoudie,"Fantastic film, nostalgia at it's finest!",8,1 July 2015,"If you're going to see this film with an attachment to the previous cast that play the characters, you're not going to have a good time, except for Arnold.Kyle Reese, Sarah Connor and the T-1000 all played by new actors, they had to try and live up to the standards of the previous actors and personally think they did extremely well. Kyle Reese played by Jai Courtney 8/10 He was terrific is his own right, but if you can't help but compare him to the original Michael Behin, who played Kyle Reese in the original, Jai is way to fresh, with a completely different personality and doesn't have the rough and haggardness / soldier vibe that Michael pulled off extremely well.Sarah Connor played by Emilia Clarke 7 / 10 It was hard to take her seriously with all the sarcasm so early in the film, Sarah was a very weak quiet sort of character in the first film and was still quiet in the second film but angry at the world and hating everything, Sarah was a very negative person. Emilia is way to upbeat and also doesn't give off a hard enough personality with compared to the original Linda Hamilton, Emilia plays the role well but i think the script was too saracastic for her..T-1000 Played by Lee Byung-hun 10/10 Played excellent very very close to the Robert Patrick, the only difference is Robert Patrick looks creepy in general which is almost impossible to mimic.John Connor played by Jason Clark 10/10 Absolutely outstanding performance, it was great because we have never really seen John Connor grown up so for Jason to play John it was perfect he nailed it!Overall Film 8.5/10 The attention to detail of the time travel to original scenes from the first film was almost seamless, right down to the point of locations, scripts, clothing and perfect special effects of Arnold versing himself. So if you want a piece of nostalgia this is right up your alley. The Backstory behind Kyle Reese is all there now, it is now shown and the delivery is really well done. The future war scenes are seamless and absolutely outstanding, not over done, the machines used were a perfect reminiscence of the future war scenes from Terminator 2 but much smoother. They didn't pump the future war scenes which was good, personally there is only so much of that stuff you can watch until it becomes just a mess.The plot is great and definitely worth watching, this film is something you can't go in with the expectation of bouncing off from the third of fourth Terminator this is a reboot and it's really well done.Arnold is outstanding and perfect amount of humor used during his scenes and manages to pull off all the scenes perfectly, they show him age throughout the film which is incredible and it's nice to see him play a role as he is representing his age, if they tried to make him play a younger version it wouldn't have worked.The ending is killer and I love the fact that it leaves it open for another film to come and the concept is excellent.Now for the Flaws. (Spoilers) I personally think the only real necessary flaws to mention would be the fact that some of the cast could have been thought through more. Bringing Dr Silberman back would have been fantastic because their was a spot there to use him.Putting details in that couldn't be recreated like the photo of Sarah taken with the Polaroid was a bit cheesy and not needed simply because it couldn't be done because of the change of actor. The fight scene between Arnold 84 and Arnold 2015 was great besides the fact Arnold 84 didn't run like that, he walked and jogged if anything like a robot would, but seeing him bolt / sprint at Arnold 2015 was the only thing i thought was a bit odd and the fact that Arnold didn't have the sniper was a bit odd too he could have easily shot the terminator in the heart with the shotgun.Overall a fantastic film and a must to go see I can't wait for the second!",Terminator Genisys
990,eli-60151,Time Travel can be complicated but also a lot of fun.,9,1 July 2015,"I am always a little scared when it comes to stories that have to do with time travel because it places a lot of questions instead of answers. So with that said I do see why some folks had some bad reviews, but lets just step back for a moment and maybe just enjoy the ride. I enjoyed this film a lot, I did not think I would but I did. It was a fun movie to watch, especially in 3D were the visuals are amazing. The acting was very good, and this is one of Arnold's great roles, he nailed it. Some of us will have a lot of questions after we watch the movie and maybe that is why they will have 2 more Terminator movies. Again it is a fun movie and I recommend for folks to watch it and just enjoy it.",Terminator Genisys
991,taraellisphotography,A TRUE Terminator Fan Will Enjoy This New Installment!,9,1 July 2015,"There are clearly two camps in these reviews. I think that what it comes down to, is whether or not you are a true fan of Terminator one and two.I am 43, and Those first two films still rank in my top ten all-time movie favorites. I'm not even sure how many times I've watched them, but it's a lot. I tend to compare all scifi to them, and most fall way short. Why? Because of the characters, the back story, the excellent filming/directing and cutting edge graphics. For those that were around back then, both T1 and T2 were the first of their kind when it comes to special affects.NOW...I'll put it simply: This movie ROCKS!I saw this in IMAX 3D and the experience was nothing short of amazing. I felt completely submerged in it, and that has a lot to do with my positive experience.I felt that the casting was great. Yes, Sarah Conner could have been better, but let's face it; NO ONE will ever be better than Linda Hamilton. No one. That is the one and only complaint I have, is that she didn't make a cameo appearance some where. I would have loved to have seen her.I keep saying that true fans will like this, because it's all of the tie ins and references that I enjoyed so much. The same things that the critics are complaining about. For me, it was full of nostalgia, and anyone complaining about this aspect of the movie just....doesn't...get it. It would be like saying Star Wars 1 was better than Star Wars 4 because of the CGI. *gasp* When something has been done to perfection, why try to do it better? The story and characters were already there, so no need to re-invent anything. They went back and played off of what made T1 and T2 so great, and for that I applaud them! To those that don't like it...well, go enjoy your Star was 1,2 and 3. ;)The CGI was impeccable, the acting was compelling, the story was believable and the action was non-stop. However, it wasn't over done. None of it was. I think it was a perfect balance and I'm already looking forward to going back and seeing it again with my kids!!",Terminator Genisys
992,bllaughridge,Does no one understand how magnets work?,8,1 July 2015,"I can accept the time traveling, shape shifting, robots from the future. What is disappointing is the lack of quality control for concepts from middle school level chemistry and physics.When the oxygen bottle is flying around the hospital and gets stuck to the MRI... did no one on set realize that oxygen tanks are aluminum or do they just not realize that aluminum is non-ferrous?*Another side note, helicopters are able to fly because of a very delicate balance of many forces acting in opposition to one another, it takes remarkably little to upset that balance yet somehow one was able to fly through fire without flaming out, then literally explode and still remain controllable.",Terminator Genisys
993,AlexisS17,Genuinely one of the worst films I've seen.,1,1 July 2015,"Not so bad it's good. So bad it's really, really, really bad. The plot makes no sense at all under even the slightest bit of scrutiny. The acting is brought down to a terrible level by Jai Courteney who really lets down the rest of the cast. The action beats are derivative and the CGI dreadful. The movie lurches from unconvincing action scene to unconvincing action scene linked by scenes of ridiculous, corny exposition and downright awful attempts at comedy. The 'love' interest between the two leads is the most unearned I've ever seen.The ONLY positives were seeing Arnie back (albeit on autopilot) and Jason Clarke who was the best thing in the movie.Truly a bad movie.",Terminator Genisys
994,fozziebear-70151,Don't listen to the critics- go and see it for yourself!,10,2 July 2015,"First of all, as an avid Terminator mythos fan, I was cautiously optimistic about seeing this reboot (with Arnold, finally!)...wondering if they could pull it off. Well, they did! With enough allusions to former Terminator lore to please serious fans of the genre, along with great plot twists and as-expected awesome special effects, I wasn't disappointed. The actors selected to play Sarah Connor, Kyle Reese and John Connor were believable and convincing- I went into the film, of course thinking of the incomparable Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, and how difficult it would be to replace her in this film. Emilia Clarke did a nice job, and Jai Courtney was just as convincing as Michael Biehn's Reese was in the original. I loved the way they worked an aging Terminator into the plot- and Arnold did a fantastic job of embracing the role. When T2 came out in 1991, I saw it several times in the theater after it was released- I might just be back again for repeat screenings of this reboot as well. In short, an awesome, entertaining film sure to please serious Terminator and Arnie fans! go see it, you won't be disappointed.",Terminator Genisys
995,ochocinco-08437,Ignore the Harsh Critic Reviews,8,2 July 2015,"POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD -but not any that will truly ruin the movie for you.First of all, I was really nervous to go see this film. I really enjoyed watching the first two movies because they were masterpieces, in my opinion; James Cameron did a great job. I wish he hadn't sold the rights back in the 80s and that we would have more Terminator movies from him.Since then, I had to endure the T3 which wasn't terrible, but was a little bit of disappointment. Terminator Salvation was a little better but seemed to stray a little too far from the original storyline- which kind of turned me off to the direction the franchise was taking. I didn't want to see people running around with M16's shooting at metal machines that would easily be able to shake off such damage in the original movies. I wanted laser guns and Arnold Schwarzenegger.And now- with Genisys- there is some of both. The bleak future Cameron painted in the T1 and T2 was followed more accurately in this movie (maybe part of the reason he thinks highly of this take on his creation), and Arnold is back taking hit after hit. He has some one-liners, little jokes and, most importantly, develops his character further than in any of the other movies. You find yourself rooting for him even more because, though he is a machine and cannot feel pain, sorrow, remorse or happiness he seems to have an attachment to Sarah as her guardian and ""Pops."" It kind of got be to thinking that he was changing just like the synthetic personality in Idoru by William Gibson. He even seems fatherly, and jokes that Reese has a small schlonger.I really enjoyed the action sequences, though some seem to see them as unrealistic or unbelievable. But who really cares? It's about battling robots and a nuclear apocalypse brought on by Skynet. I'm at the movies to be entertained, and it was definitely entertaining. If you can find yourself to look beyond some of the movie's downfalls- ie character development (except Arnie), cheesy romance, jumpy plot- then fans of the franchise will probably come out thinking it was worth the ticket price and 2 hours of their time.It isn't a rehash of the original story because the franchise has lost it's way. It is a retelling of the original story that is more thought provoking than just having Christian Bale run around trying to blow sh!+ up. And by the way, Clarke did a much better job as Connor than Bale and probably didn't blow up on the set because he didn't have his omelet prepared correctly or something childish. Sorry, I lost my train of thought for a second. Anyway- if you're down to see robots duking it out, Arnold back and kickin' a$$ and a good flick for eating some popcorn and explaining to your girlfriend what just happened, then go see this movie.Ignore the harsh critic reviews and give it a shot. I'm definitely gonna go back and watch the other movies because of Genisys so that I can rethink my life after the plot twists in this movie. Even though Paramount and Skydance gave away the biggest part of the movie in the trailer...Anyway, I'm gonna go to the gym so I can be the next Terminator. HE'S BACK!!!",Terminator Genisys

I saw the film in 3D at the Imax love it. I highly recommend this film go watch it now!Arnold is back and boy did he do good job in this film Arnold character was much more fascinating and compelling. The time travel was very digestible with substance beyond your expectations.I also think Emily Clark did a very good job as Sara Connor. I was so excited and immersed in delight , that my bag of popcorn was empty, in the first 5 minutes, a first in movie going for me. The movie ignites, and inflames your imagination leaving you with a desire to see this masterpiece of filmmaking again and again. Get extra bags of popcorn.!!!",Terminator Genisys
997,moviereviewrob,Story contradicts first Terminator movie,1,2 July 2015,"One of the best moments of the first Terminator movie was towards the end when Sarah Connor crushes the terminator in its metal skeletal form, and just when she thought she was safe, the hand continues to chase after her. Even though the effects are outdated today, this concept of a limb coming after you is still scary and creepy today, which makes the first terminator movie a timeless classic.However, in Terminator Genisys, in the notorious scene played over and over in the trailers where the terminator battles another version of himself from the 80s, the only thing required to ""kill"" or break/shut down the bad terminator from the 80s is a gunshot from Sarah Connor, leaving a hole in the heart area and allowing it to collapse and shut down. Its limbs were still intact and could have come after them, but instead the good terminator/guardian just holds up a thumbs up sign at Sarah Connor, implying they had just won over the bad terminator from the 80s.The only thing required to make the story consistent with the technology portrayed in the first terminator movie is maybe a shot of Sarah Connor or Arnold throwing a grenade at it or something, but it seems the screenwriters just didn't care.The ending also seemed to be a cop-out as there was nothing original and has been done repeatedly in multiple films, TV shows, and cartoons internationally. There is no reason to see this movie sooner than later, be it in a theater, a discount theater, on Netflix, on cable, or from an airplane seat.",Terminator Genisys
998,russ-11690,"I hope this franchise ""will be back""",10,2 July 2015,"I'm going to keep this one spoiler free. Genysis really does feel like the true 3rd film of the franchise. Arnold is back, and he really carries the weight of this film. He plays a more friendly terminator that ages throughout the film and makes the occasional joke. Emilia Clarke plays a strong Sarah Connor, reminiscent of T2. Jason Clarke plays the antagonist (as you can see in the trailer), but there is a deeper layer to it than what you can see on the surface. Jai Courtny isn't bad either as Kyle Reese. The movie is a non-stop action ride, and kept my eyes glued to the screen at all times. There are a lot of terminator on terminator action scenes that are some of the best fight scenes of the franchise. The story takes places primarily in three different times, but its not too hard to follow if you pay attention. (even though some critics panned this aspect, it really isn't hard to get). There are plot twists that aren't in the trailers, so don't think they've spoiled everything for you. Bottom line: If you liked the first two movies, you will like this one. AND stay after the credits for a special scene.",Terminator Genisys

This new generation of Hollywood movies is so lost in its filming technique and originality it has to remake all the classics we grew up loving.I and my friend were very skeptical opening night if Genisys was going to take it back to its roots. Before we entered to find our seats out side the lobby we were reminiscing on the first Terminator and what was great about it that only real fans would appreciate.We both said when Kyle Reese goes back to 1984 and is in the sporting goods store and quickly grabs a pair of Nike's and straps them up does not happen in this movie this franchise is done with...to our inner child's delight this event and others were here in new generation 4k glory. James Cameron showed us 80s early 90s fans Love with this movie and in my opinion hit every note of what i expected old school and new.Emilia Clarke's portrayal of as Sarah Connor made me smile as she is vulnerable yet a strong female presence and kicks metal ass like no other.I found my self turned on as a guy by her gusto and bravery which very few young ladies can capture in this modern era. Its a damn movie people so if any ones arguing about time travel doesn't exist,its hard to follow,its not original,it tries too hard...Those people are in love with modern social media and cant tell a solid well shot thinking mans science fiction action movie when it kicks them in they're Iron man 3 garbage loving asses(worst movie of all time,iron man 3...(AVENGERS 2 was cool OK 4 out of 5 stars,relax)I'm not going to spoil anything besides what was mentioned unlike a lot of hating ignorant soulless critics, but can say for sure us older generations will have regained our faith in this franchise as it is shot super clean in a old school fixed fashion that makes current generations shaky ass camera twitches and zooming ins look like child's play... First rule you learn in video production,no gad damn zooming in and twitchy movements.You will fail the course miserably if you turn in amateur video like that. Oh i guess you didn't know that, but you praise movies with shaky ass shots and zooming in and a red head running in freak-en heels in the jungle and mud for the whole damn movie like Jurassic world which was a 3 out of 5 stars(not bad,it was good,no hate besides that,relax people)but your hating on this movies plot and story...um your hating opinions can be blown to dust like Sky Net...laugh out loud... (""John Connar from terminator 2 speaking""why'd you do that?

1001,ayylmaocx,Movie was better than all terminator movies.,10,3 July 2015,It kinda felt/is somehow like x-men days of future past. Cause they both both had to travel back in time to prevent something from happening in the future and as they go they create alternate timeline.In X-men:DoFP the sentinels want to kill human race & mutants and in Terminator the terminators are. And in both movies there's a dark future which can be changed by traveling back to time. Also both franchise somehow go back to there first movies. Hugh Jackman & Arnold Schwarzenegger are actors that have to be in both movies to make it great or else it sucks. Like it's gonna totally be terrible without them. y'all should really go see terminator genisys. Its great. Won't make you be boring on the beginning nor the end.,Terminator Genisys
1002,lastrep,Cameron-worthy sequel to Terminator 1 and 2,10,3 July 2015,"As Cameron himself has already said about this instalment, it's as close as you'll get to the original Terminators. Any true fan will agree and APPRECIATE this fact.I will admit I am a huge Terminator and Terminator II fan, and seeing how those movies have ranked in the history of film, I am joined by millions going in to this new era.As most of yoy, I was flooded with the ""critic"" reviews leading to this movie whom didn't just give it a poor rating, but incredibly low scores. Things that make you go hmmmmm...I decided to not listen to these ""critics"" as they've not once yet been correctabout ""MY"" thoughts, emotions and reactions to movies.. thank goodness I have stuck with my gut go ahead. I never understood how someone could live their lives based on other peoples opinions.. regardless.. on to this amazing movie!I felt the movie was easily a 8.5 to 9 out of 10.The effects, story lines, acting are all on par and most importantly - they follow the flow and feel of the original Terminators which makes it such a huge success.To those ""critics"" that were confused by the time-travel aspects of the film.. you have to be kidding me. The movie does explain it very well and hey, if you think it is too crazy or confusing then you cannot appreicate what the terminator and Skynet is all about.To those ""critics"" that thought Arnold is too old for this role.. you again, must be kidding me. Arnold plays the T-800 perfectly and the age factor is worked extremely well in to the story line.To those ""critics"" that thought there just was not enough to the acting for Arnold and the new cast.. you must have expected some Shakespearean play or the type.. this is the Terminator folks. That being said, if you appreciate T1 and T2, this is right up there.To those ""critics"" that kept complaining that this movie depended on using scenes from the first two Terminators.. well actually, that is the whole point of the movie as it is a sequel. This instalment brilliantly plays with the time travel concept to re-visit past story lines that not just bring back great memories, but builds on them and creates a new era of the Terminator go ahead where the original story line began. It is impossible to do a sequel of any kind without using facets of the previous movie.. not sure why the critics cannot grasp this simple concept. If you ignore the past details, movies such as T4 flop. This time around, they got it right. It is impossible to re-write the Terminator, you can just go ahead with what is laid out originally.All I have to say is that after T3 (which was OK) and T4 which was just horrible.. we are finally treated to something that connect with T2.Get ready for tons of amazing action, CGI, great moments to connect with the cast and best of all.. the return of Schwarzenegger which has been a long time coming.I highly recommend you go watch this movie.. if you are an Arnold fan or a Terminator fan then it is a must.. and for those that just want to watch some incredible action you can do that as well.",Terminator Genisys
1003,stephaniespraytanner,Entire series becomes pointless,1,31 July 2015,"The story contains the existence of alternate timelines but if they exist you can have as many timelines as you want and the story will never end. Winning the battle against Skynet would mean nothing because the characters can travel back in time and it can happen all over again, forever and ever. Everything that happened in Terminator 1-5 will just be one of those timelines and anything can be changed at any time, including a win against Skynet if it ever happens. Also Terminator 1 didn't even need to happen if the Guardian could successfully protect Sarah Connor. Oh right, it's just an alternate timeline, so what's the point? Just create 20 or 30 timelines if you want the franchise to go on forever.",Terminator Genisys
1004,rexdalezz_fynest,"The Franchise is finally ""Back""",10,4 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys is the best Terminator film to have been released in as many years since the departure of James Cameron. Personally thought this movie would be another rise of the machines crap.. with sub par acting and outlandish unrequired comedy or would be a heartless re-imagining which would be in tune with Salvation.This movie however does a magnificent job of recreating the same ambiance that Terminator 2 and the fear of the original Terminator from the first film. Multiple terminator battles between t-800's and t-1000's fantastically organized to make sense. Time travel films usually become convoluted with timelines and repercussions however Genisys does well to maintain them within a singular stream so as not to lose the audience in scientific mumbo-jumbo. Arnold Schwarzenegger t-800 this time I believe was exactly how John Connor's T-800 would have turned out if it had continued to learn rather than been destroyed at the end of T2. Emilia Clarke's Sarah Connor was both believable and relatable.. her choices in the movie seemed as well grounded (in a movie with man killing robots and the worlds impending doom) as could be. Jai Courtney hurt this film but still not as much as one would have thought. His portrayal of Kyle Reese didn't create the same feeling of desperation we felt from Michael Biehn from the first film however in the action sequences he was quite believable and in those moments we saw that same desperation and experienced fighter. Jason Clarke as the new terminator was a breathe of fresh air, with his charismatic and animated facial expressions you really felt horrible for the Savior of mankind tried as he did to best the machines to ultimately become one. Genisys did great to create the personal fear on ground level with the terminators still hunting and really showing just how powerless humanity is in terms of strength while standing toe-to-toe with these machines. And did a great job in reminding us about the bigger picture at play in the background with Skynet always working to ensure its survival at any cost.Action and CGI work was very well done as to be expected of a Terminator film. The film itself hasn't reinvented the wheel nor has it reinvented this franchise. I do believe however that as first instalments go this movie did well to;i) Updated the franchise technology wise to a more relatable world ii) Re-establish a proper functioning timeline iii) Create an emotional attachment to characters iv) Set up a future where the franchise could flow to.I absolutely loved it and I hope more people go watch this film I plan on seeing it again The Terminator is finally back.The Terminator 1984 - 8.5 Judgement Day 1991 - 9.5 Rise of the Machines 2003 - 5.5 Salvation 2009 - 6 Genisys 2015 - 9",Terminator Genisys

My dad rented Terminator 2 and I was lucky enough to watch it. It was amazing. I fell in love and watched it at least 100 times after. When Terminator 3 came out, I was very disappointed. It wasn't terrible, but it didn't feel the same. Then Salvation... well it had some good ideas and cool scenes, but overall, it was a fail, especially the second half.Terminator Genisys was actually pretty good. I mean, there were some goofy moments here and there, but it truly feels the closest to the original two films. This is not just because of the recreation of some of the scenes from those two films, but also the overall feel. The music, the settings, Arnold's acting... it all feels pretty right again. Not perfectly right, but close enough. Give it a chance. If you are a big fan of Terminator, I think you will like this one.",Terminator Genisys
1006,garzahugo,"Great underrated movie,",10,4 July 2015,"First i have to admit i didn't have good expectations after Salvation but since i'm a big fan i had to go and watch It, It Was a great action flick that makes T3 and T4 look outdated. i also admit that had an horrible trailers that have had some bad effect with critics and no fans of the saga, still word to mouth TG must lift up and meet what was expected from It. The good 1. Arnold, no ONE would ever act like a robot like him 2. The T101 and T1000 sequence, one word, awesome 3. Mr. Clarke is the best John Connor so far 4. Great plot and Awesome visual effects.The bad 1.Arnold, he has lost all the commercial power he once had. 2.The forced romance between Sarah and Kyle, It failed. 3. Too many questions unanswered. 4. Too much competition TG didn't expect JW being so big as Inside out",Terminator Genisys
1007,ucharab,Awesome movie!,10,5 July 2015,"It's a very well written story and Arnold rocks all the way! The move exceeded my expectations. Watch in 3D.The story was very enjoyable and very well handled. Unlike most movies 3D experience was very good. Arnold was at his best with humour, emotion and machine blended with perfect mix. The rest of the star cast did a fantastic job.My wife and kids were able to connect with the story even without much background of terminator series. They thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and next day we watched terminator 1 & 3 at home. If you are a terminator and Arnold fan, go for it without second thought! it's much better than terminator salvation.",Terminator Genisys
1008,joethe,Don't watch this film.,1,5 July 2015,"This film lacked any sort of real meaningful character development. The story was flawed and had no real purpose. Fight scenes were boring and predictable, there were no twists or exciting story points. The plot was linear and the time travel element was extremely hard to follow. In summary do not watch this film or at least don't go to the cinema to watch it, it is waste of money and time. The lighting and special affects were however and the cast was pretty good, however this all went to waste. I really liked other terminators but I feel the franchise is now worn out, this film had horrible technicalities to make it make sense *SPOILER* like the different timelines were a ridiculous idea and made very little sense.",Terminator Genisys
1009,caboosecultist,Terminator Genisys is Best Film in the Series,10,5 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys is one of the best movies I have seen this year. While some people are tearing it up I thought I should show the world why this movie is what it should be and exceeded my expectations.First thing this movie does is pay homage to the original two films that made Terminator a staple in cinema history. In fact T2 is the reason I got into movies in the first place. While I do agree that Genisys contains a whole lot of rehashed things from the original two films, that does not take away anything from this movie. I think some of the rehash makes the film seem more fitted, into the Terminator universe, than anything that Terminator Salvation did. Secondly, Genisys is, suppose to be, the beginning of a new trilogy. The first three films were great movies that tied up the story of the time before the war in a neat bow. Salvation is not, in my mind, a part of that story or any other Terminator story. Genisys now begins a new era into what is a great franchise as a whole. We have gotten through the first movies' stories and can now begin new ones that will tell their own tales. Terminator Genisys was exactly what it needed to be. A stand alone Terminator film that told a different take of the story that was in the original Terminator. A great start to a hopefully new trilogy.Now for the spoiler: The best part of this whole movie for me was the character played by Matt Smith. I am a Whovian and was excited to see Mr. Smith in the movies cast. He first appears in the future and has one line of dialogue. Later it is revealed that he is literally Skynet through the hologram of Skynet that is about to be unleashed upon the world in 2017.",Terminator Genisys
1010,danielharrison-63131,"Not a patch on the first two films, but a massive improvement over Salvation",6,5 July 2015,"The new film in the Terminator franchise is surprisingly enjoyable, for all of ten minutes. The film begins exactly where fans wanted it to begin, the conflict between man and machine, it seems like finally audiences will see the epic struggle teased in the first two films. It is, unfortunately short lived, as we are then subjected to two hours of what must be the most convoluted, contradictory time travel plot line in cinematic history. Unfortunately the trailer had given most of the surprises away, a tendency the Terminator films have a nasty habit of doing. So while I will avoid spoilers where possible, the honest truth is that there are not many to give away in fairness. The main problem the film has, is that it has none of the ominous threat of the first two films. What made Terminator and Terminator 2 so great, was the fact you had an unstoppable killing machine hell bent on destroying humanities future, by hunting characters who we felt were extremely vulnerable, Sarah Connor in the first and John in the second. There was a true feeling of terror and fear for the characters lives. Never once throughout Genisys do you truly feel these characters are vulnerable, you actually fear for the machines.I can understand what the writers were trying to do, by exploring the past and recreating the events of the first two films, but is that what audiences really wanted? I mean we've seen those films and seen them done much better thanks to Mr Cameron. Surely by changing these events creates a massive paradox, as ultimately, doesn't John Connor's existence depend on the machines? If the Terminators didn't exist, then one never would have been sent back to kill Sarah Connor, which in turn means Kyle Reese would never have been sent back to father John. So even if we choose to ignore this fact, and the whole point is to stop judgement day from ever occurring, the film chooses to skip over the whole explanation and simply asks the audience to pretty much just accept it. No amount of exposition ever truly explains this to the audience. As surely if the mission is to stop judgement day, then the Terminators wouldn't exist who were sent back in time to protect/kill the characters in the first place?The film leaves you with a lot more questions than answers, and the more you think about the whole time travel debacle subplots, the more it doesn't make any sense. However if you can completely switch your mind off, and sit back and enjoy the action, you will leave thinking the film was OK.",Terminator Genisys
1011,paulus_cobris-01705,Terminator Genesys - Back to the greatness,10,5 July 2015,"Hello... Just got back from seeing Terminator: Genisys... What a big surprise this was...Being fan of the franchise, i was a little apprehensive when i heard the first ideas of the movie plot...But man... what a clever plot this was... Very well written!This movie does pay a very good homage to T1 and T2, but does allow for T3 and T4 to exist without being ignored movies.I will not spoil nothing that are in store on this movie, but what i can tell it that this movie really refresh the franchise in a very clever way.The casting was great and again a surprise...Sarah Connor is very good on this movie, Kyle Reese is a welcome addition to the trio...

1012,spiderboy-88261,"New Timeline, Different, but Adequate..",8,6 July 2015,"Terminator: Genisys is the fifth movie in the Terminator series, and set in an alternate timeline, different from the first four movies. The film starts off in continuation of the fourth movie, Terminator: Salvation, in the year 2029, where John Connor (Jason Clarke) plans a final attack on Skynet's central core and its time machine simultaneously. Skynet was destroyed but successfully sent a T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), before any of the events from previous Terminator movies was set in, hence the alternate story line. Consequently, John Connor had to choose one of his most trusted men, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney), to time-travel back to save John's mother, Sarah. However, the past was not what Reese expected and had to time travel to 2017 to prevent Skynet from ever being created with the help of Sarah Connor and her reprogrammed T-800 protector. Overall, this movie had a somewhat confusing timeline, plot twists but was very entertaining to watch as the action-packed events unfolded, as well as the character development and state-of-the-art CGI.In addition to the Terminator series already confusing storyline, especially for first-time viewers, there are a few plot twists. For instance, there is a plot twist in this alternate timeline, where terminators had already been sent back into an even more distant past. This leaves the audience to wonder what exactly happened, and the way Kyle Reese responded to the events was outstanding, as he adapted to the situation. Kyle Reese's traumatic experiences with terminators in the future left him to trust no machine, including the reprogrammed T-800 that is programmed to protect Sarah Connor, who was sent back anonymously. Furthermore, the T-800, ""Pops,"" originally does not see Kyle Reese as a suitable guardian for Sarah Connor, but as the plot progresses, both characters begin to mutually trust each other. Another plot twist that leaves the audience in awe is when future John Connor appears in this alternate timeline in 2017, not as a human, but rebuilt as a machine-like being by future Skynet, after Sarah and Kyle time- traveled from 1984 to 2017. This movie's storyline is not too hard to follow (only if you pay attention to all the details), but when pieced together with other movies from the series, it is. For the reason that there is just too much time-traveling in this series, let alone this movie. Yet, the plot twists actually make the movie more suspenseful. This movie should be treated as a completely separate movie from the rest of the series, as it has almost no relation to the others in terms of timeline. The main characters in this movie are very dynamic and interesting, which include John Connor, Sarah Connor, Kyle Reese, and the reprogrammed T-800 ""Pops"". Originally, John Connor is shown as a hero and leader but then is surprisingly shown as the main villain later on. Both, Kyle Reese's and Pops' character personality changes as they gain trusts in one another, leaving the audience satisfied. In the beginning, Sarah Connor felt she needed to withhold her knowledge of the past and future from Kyle Reese, but eventually opened up to him as their relationship grew. Another character worth mentioning is the police officer, O'Brien (J.K Simmons), who later becomes devoted to helping the protagonists, after witnessing the T-1000 kill his partner. The characters in this film have plenty of pathos or emotional appeal and is hard not to feel any emotional attachment as the movie progresses. The actors effectively portrayed these dynamic characters throughout the film as well. Additionally, the character's personalities fit well with the identical characters from other movies in the series.The advance CGI in the film is realistic looking and adds to the intensity of the film. CGI was used heavily and effectively during the action scenes, such as when John Connor regenerates, the T-1000 shape shifts, Skynet uses its technology, and the Golden Gate Bridge collapses. The film also accurate portray its setting, such as when it was set in San Francisco; the people, culture, and environment was realistic. Moreover, the movie has plenty of hardcore action scenes, machine to machine fighting, and explosions that captivate viewers with its mesmerizing graphics, special effects, and sound effects. The way the movie was filmed and portrayed was very Terminator-like, even though it was made with a different director and cast (except for Arnold Schwarzenegger). All in all, this Terminator movie leaves both action-movie and Terminator fans satisfied with its suspenseful plot-twisting storyline, dynamic characters, and excellent graphics. The director did a good job keeping it Terminator-like, but with a whole new plot and timeline. There are also questions left unanswered, such as, who sent the T- 800 to protect Sarah Connor? Moreover, the last scene showed a time machine. Accordingly, there is a high possibility that there will be another Terminator film, but with more time traveling... The Terminator series timeline has been skewed many times and is already very complex. It is as if the writers improvised this film on top of the first four films, just to make another sequel or sequels. In other words, the writers decided to scrap the original timeline and start a whole new timeline just to make more movies, but did a decent job with it. I suggest keeping time-traveling to a minimum in the next film. For what it is, this film is adequate alone.",Terminator Genisys
1013,tduff-16483,"Hasta la vista, intelligent writing",3,7 July 2015,"Mr. (writers of this film), what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent (script) were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having (watched) it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.Having said that, fans will nod at some of the nostalgia sprinkled throughout the film. The movie will remind you early on that in fact, this is a Terminator movie. It has some of the cheesy lines and retro looks to prove it. And of course Arnold. Some of the action sequences were done well, and these are the only moments of the film that are truly enjoyable. But one must drudge through the horrible dialogue that unfortunately for fans, is featured heavily over its fairly good action parts. Terminator has always had time travel in its DNA, but the less it tries to explain it-the better off for everyone involved. They failed to remember that this time around, and the movie suffers.Is this movie better than the last two movies in the franchise? Yes, but that still leaves it short of T1 and miles short of T2: Judgement Day.",Terminator Genisys
1014,mjexley,"Fantastic, fans will love it, go see!",10,7 July 2015,"Just been to see this film, I was not let down, it's the sequel I've been waiting for for years! Since the first time I saw T1 in the 90s I've been a dedicated fan, T2 blew me away, it had everything, action, effects, story and the best theme tune ever. I did like T3 and Salvation, there good, but Genisys is the sequel I had expected and longed for. I won't spoil it for anyone, just go and see it. Ignore the harsh reviews, if your a fan (or not) you'll love it. It's not hard to follow, it's just a very clever story and plot. It'll have you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Roll on next year for the next film! I can't wait!",Terminator Genisys
1015,leongwei-70745,Amazing movie!,10,9 July 2015,It was an amazing movie for me. Definitely the best movie of the year. It is action packed all the way from start to finish and has the necessary emotional scenes which are well acted out. Also the best Arnold movie in centuries! His past cameos and movies are not great but this one is good! This is his best movie in a long time. I would definitely be looking forward to seeing the sequel! I really wonder why there r so many bad reviews on this because this movie can be a classic. It's just that good. I would definitely be watching it again. This will definitely be one of the classic blockbusters. Bravo for a good terminator movie. It certainly wipes away the disappointment of the last terminator movie.,Terminator Genisys
1016,gpidoux-78121,A GREAT Terminator movie!,8,9 July 2015,"I've just arrived from the cinema... The movie is awesome, yes is not T2. Yes is way, waaaay better than T3 and TSalvation.The first part is an incredible return to the 90's and the second part is fresh and innovating.I honestly, really don't get the bad critics toward Emilia and the rest of the cast that i have read/heard....They are incredible and the movie is always fast-pacing and full of action as every terminator movie should be.The story is different (and for good)...deal with it.Arnold is greater than ever and for luck it looks like we have Terminator for a few more years! :)",Terminator Genisys
1017,madelselim,Maybe a good action movie but a Terrible Terminator movie,4,10 July 2015,"Terminator Genisys is a Terminator movie, without THE Terminator. You can't feel the presence of Arnold as the Terminator, that character that you love, fear and wait for him to appear on the screen to Terminate his enemies and help Sarrah, John or Kyle with the same facial expression and the same sharp look in his eyes. While from to time, drop cool or funny one liners with his robotic voice. THAT Terminator doesn't exist in Terminator Genisys, that's why for me, it sucks!I can accept the time travel story and I can accept the new cast for the main roles. I can accept it and enjoy the movie IF it was a good Terminator movie. Problem is, it's not. Basically there is NO Terminator in this movie. Arnold is the Terminator. And in this movie he was horrible. It's like this director and his writers just copied everything from previous Terminator movies, except the main concept and basic idea behind the events and stories in those movies. He just copied the script, the most famous scenes and re-created them..without understanding why those movies where successful or why people loved them.Again, Arnold is the Terminator. In this movie we are introduced to an aged Terminator with almost human character. If they replaced the original Terminator with someone who looks like him and said that this is what Skynet used to build the image of T-800 then that would make more sense than this pathetic - aged - Terminator who's acting like Sarah's father!!!.. The Terminator we knew from T1 to T3 simply doesn't exist in this movie. He's not a good-guy Terminator anymore. He's a robot with Human character. Even the way he talks is changed, and now he's Sarah's daddy-robot or ""Pops"" as she calls him. Not the Terminator. And you can't have a successful Terminator movie without Arnold as the Terminator. THE Terminator that we all know and loved. This movie completely destroyed that character.Emilia Clarke was good choice as Sarah Connor. But Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese is simply a stupid choice. First of all, he looks nothing like the original actor who played this character, second his character in this movie is a joke. All he wanted during the whole movie - and looks like that's the reason he accepted the time travel mission - is to sleep with Sarah Connor!!! .. He's like a stupid teenager who just wanted to go back in time to have a chance to have sex with that hot girl he heard about from her son!!!! What made things really bad here is that Kyle and Sarah have huge role in this movie. So you can't ignore that and focus on the Terminator and his battle with the bad-guy. The story was acceptable, action, effects, music and everything was really good and you can enjoy that. But the distraction from ""Pops"" and the ""let's have sex now"" Kyle, is just too much.If you are a fan of Terminator movies, you will see everything that you loved from previous movies, they re-created the best scenes and done great job with that, especially the CGI young Arnold or the original Terminator from T1. They even copied the end of T2. But you will hate this movie when you realize that this is all, this is it, it's only well made re-created scenes one after another. You will get out of the movie with bad taste in your mouth and pain in your heart because while they re-created the scenes you love, they missed the point behind those scenes. The director and writers obviously and simply, didn't get it and didn't even try. At the end of the movie, I was waiting for the CGI Arnold to return, join John Connor and kill everyone and I wouldn't feel bad about it. Because I simply don't know those characters and I don't care about them. Sarah and Kyle, during the whole movie, end up with no scratch and full make up. From their acting, and how they look like, you can't feel that those people were ""running"" for their lives or trying to save human kind and stop the end of the world. Their voice, their looks, even their clothes.. nothing reflects the fact that they were at WAR with skynet. For me, I had no emotions for those characters. Logically, I understand what they were/are doing, but emotionally, I didn't care. For me, in this movie, my vote was for the bad guys and I felt sad and disappointed that Skynet didn't win. That's how bad it was!In this movie, the Terminator was more human than most if not all human characters. Arnold as aged T-800 was more human than Sarah and Kyle. And that's just.. wrong! When Sarah first saw John Connor, her grown up SON for the first time, that scene should be extremely emotional and mixed with shock, pain, fear and happiness. It was completely emotionless. Except John, the rest were reading their lines like robots.""I've Been Waiting For You"".. is the first thing Arnold said in this movie to his bad-guy CGI young T-800 in a beautiful opening scene. At the end and after watching Terminator Genisys, I can say to Arnold: ""I'm still waiting for you"". Still waiting fro you to ""be back"" as the Terminator from T2 and T3. Yes, you are ""aged but not obsolete"".",Terminator Genisys
1018,goetterwirsind,It is like watching beautiful jewelery explode and kill everyone! We loved it!,10,10 July 2015,"The best-new Terminator, smarter than it's viewers, rounded, polished and dark, fast and brutal - efficient and conflictingly beautiful - imagine watching this as a kid ... It felt similar to the dark knight. Time travel and fast pace iron smashing with nigh unstoppable force - I LOVE IT, my GF loves it, we had a blast, and it will blow you away, if you do not jump on the hate-train, that is o so trendy and easy to jump on! The slow motion moments are like watching murderous jewelery explode and evolve to cut and mutilate all hope - in silent hate... It is all based on quality: of persons, acting, environments and effects, what was one intend of the film crew as I recently come to know.Thanks for this movie!",Terminator Genisys
1019,suzu-89290,Great Terminator movie! For fans of T1 & T2 plus Dr Who-Family friendly,7,10 July 2015,"My immediate gut reaction to Terminator Genisys was mixed, I LOVED parts but hated others. I don't follow pre-release movie hype on the web for any movie and I never watched the trailer so I didn't know this instalment was the start of a new trilogy. For this reason I was a bit angry and sad about that realisation. Basically this Terminator movie's message is- remember how awesome T1 & T2 are? Yeah! Well, T3 & T4 never happened- BOOM! Walk away without looking back. As long as you accept that early on and don't fight it, Genisys is a great movie. Here's what I loved and hated about it (No spoilers); What I loved: 1. Arnie's back as Pops! Just as good as ever. 2. CGI animation Arnie- he's so ripped! 3. Matt Smith- It's the Doctor! I believe the director and screenwriter are total Dr Who fans. Matt Smith's inclusion seems a deliberate reference to the ultimate time lord in a movie about time travel. In fact the movie feels like a series of Dr Who episodes and effects some of the storyline is really similar. Helps make it family friendly. 4. The John Connor storyline twist- Its mind blowing because John Connor is so central to Terminator movies especially in T3 & T4 but ultimately it's clever. 5. All the T1 & T2 references especially in the beginning.What I hated: 1. Too many CGI sequences not well executed- the editing could've been better and shortened the movie to be punchier instead it dragged towards the end. 2. Action sequences were limited in blood and gore- due to family rating some of the action was lacklustre. I get why but still, I like Terminator movies partly because it's ballsy macho action at its best. 3. The ending-too Disney and aimed at Families. I'll leave it there just sad because T1 & T2 and even T3 had great questions they ended on. 4. The convoluted time travel explanation- Doesn't matter that it's fantastical just wish it was short and sweet. It's a sci-fi movie too so people just have to go with it don't bother with the details.Ultimately a great Terminator movie and OK action/sci fi movie. Could've been fantastic with better editing. I thought Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor and Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese did a great job making the characters their own. They had really brilliant performances to follow from other Terminator movies so they were fine by comparison. Jai Courtney as Kyle Reece is reminiscent of Starship Troopers- a foot soldier accepting his fate as cannon fodder for the cause. He's a classic action meathead-love it!Interested to see what stories may follow :)",Terminator Genisys
1020,mst-74767,"Not good - like 3, like Star wars 1-3 compared to 4-6",4,10 July 2015,"Interesting story (except the end), yes - but all in all the same stuff like T3 and lots of other films today - much CGI, action, no brutal scenes...as made for 16-years old teenagers.Furthermore I don't like that 16-years old looking 'sweetheart'-girl as Sarah Connor...and why the hell don't they used Christian Bale as John Connor? Even Edward Furlong would have been done a better job here! Same for some other scenes, where they exchanged the actors from old scenes with new actors.Whats going on with cinema today? I am a bit disappointed, all in all it is comparable mostly to T3 - it is like comparing Star Wars 1-3 with 4-6.",Terminator Genisys
1021,gebakkenei,Lots of humour and action!,8,11 July 2015,"I watched this movie 8 hours ago; and now that it has sunk in I must say that it is _VERY GOOD_.Every time-travel-story has unanswered questions. Why didn't you jump sooner or later? Why just one person, why not many?, Why not place weaponry inside human flesh and send kick ass guns back to 1910 :) Anyway...It was _great_ seeing Arnold in his favorite role. The jokes and references where a nice touch; if they where left out the critics would be like: where is ""I'll be back""? If you liked T2. Go see this! If you like SCI-FI: This is a good movie If you like action movies: This one.Could it be any better? Yes it could. A half an hour longer would be nice. Just to have more of this great movie. An age-rating of 16/18 instead of 12 would probably give us more bloody special effects and more after-time-travel-nakedness :)",Terminator Genisys
1022,mixail-95895,Love this movie,10,11 July 2015,"Great movie. Brilliant plot and of course return of the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger brought this movie to the absolute Awesomeness. Terminator: Genisys shows respect to the original franchise as some of the elements (time displacement unit construction, HK-Centyrion, freezer for T-800 models etc) were taken from James Cameron's unused concept art and first script drafts. And yes, movie does leave some unanswered questions. Like, who sent T-1000 and T-800/Pops to kill/ save 9 years old Sarah? Why Pops immediately recognized a terminator in John Connor? From witch reality Skynet/T-5000 came to the reality of 1997- Judgement Day? But as movie writers explained in their interview - the answers are saved for two future sequels.",Terminator Genisys
1023,ahkh-99496,A creativity killer,1,11 July 2015,"It would have been much better if they have released the terminator 2 in 3D, rather wasting a lot of effects in making a sequel. Its a waste of time and money, just awful, horrible movie. A creativity killer. No cohesive story line. No dramatic dialogues. Horrible acting. shameful direction. Mr. Arnold is old and passed. Movie, A creativity killer. To lengthy. Previous terminator movies contained a powerful inspiring character who make ""Arnold Schwarzenegger"" a house hold name, a Governor and in Genisys, its replaced by a weird looking, horrible man who don't inspire at all. Again I would say, no cohesive story line. No dramatic dialogues. Horrible acting. shameful direction and A creativity killer.",Terminator Genisys
1024,connorskoglund,A Solid Follow Up,8,11 July 2015,"To my shock this film has been buried by critics professional and other (YouTube) but I can assure you it doesn't deserve it.'The film is a fun sequel to the terminator series that creates a refreshing re imagining of the previous films that features plenty of references and Easter eggs while not compromising the integrity of the proceeding films. The action is incredible, showcasing many intense sequences that I never would have thought would ever appear in a terminator film (most of which are spoiled in the trailers...).But as I stated before this film does have flaws. One of which is the convoluted plot. Time travel is once again showcased heavily in this film and once again it is not properly explained. I for one have seen all the terminator films more than once and was able to examine the time travel used and decipher how the f##k it all works, but even then it took me a couple of days. For example why is Judgement day delayed if the events of T2 never took place? If they go back in time and don't give birth to John how is he alive in the future? All these can be answered just by knowledge of time travel and the terminator lore ,however most fans who don't know the terminator lore well or at all will be baffled by the time travel and completely confused. This film really needed a solid explanation of time travel and alternate timelines in order to clarify how the f##k this sh#t happens and why the f##k that sh#t doesn't.Other than the convoluted plot the acting also is quite a hindrance, especially in terms of Jai Courtney who lacks any kind of charisma and just feels out of place as a soldier that has spent his life watching his world be destroyed by machines. Every scene he is in had me going ""why is he so calm!?! why does he look constipated!?! why is he so dull!?!"". Other than Jai however Arnold and Emilia both fit into their respective roles seamlessly.\Overall the film is very good, its entertaining, action packed, respectful to the previous films, and gives us one of the more original terminator film plots since T2. All in all I don't understand why this film is getting hate. Same critics accuse it of going to the well to many times plot wise, however I found it to be a very original plot that rewrites the whole history of Terminator lore. Others attack the references to the other films, which I agree is excessive but never annoying. I also have to point out that after the first 30-35 minutes all the references stop and the film then focuses on what's new. If your a terminator fan its a solid 8/10 if not it will probably only be a 6/10 due to the confusing plot and at times wooden acting (looking at you Jai)",Terminator Genisys
1025,gabriel-49306,Critics are out of their minds best terminator ever.,10,11 July 2015,"These critics are out of their minds terminator genisys is the most epic terminator movie out of all of them combined , matching current sci-fi technology, amazing action and magnificent storyline. You are on the edge of your seat from beginning to end wondering what will happen next. This is just a ploy to try bring down an older actor . I loved how Arnold morphed throughout the whole movie in age and kept true to his iconic character with his stoic humor and intense demeanor. You nailed it ,""old but not obsolete."" If you haven't watched this movie on the big screen, you are missing our dramatically! Their hasn't been a better action film than this in over a decade: it has drama, amazing action and perfect visual effects, perfect storyline, and excellent acting all around. Would have liked to see Christian Bale as John Conner , but it was an excellent movie. Rotten tomatoes your ratings are rotten and out of touch. Rated pg-13 so bring your older kids ,they will love this movie and so will you. It shows the greatest story of when people think your down and out, pursue the impossible odds for achievement. Kind of like the American dream. Arnold your the man, Nice to meet you critics, get out.",Terminator Genisys
1026,andersonzhili,Excellent Movie! Don't listen to the critics.,10,12 July 2015,"This is an absolute must see movie if you are a terminator fan. If not, watch the first 2 movies then watch this one. You will be blown away. I went in expecting a horrible movie from the reviews at rotten tomatoes, but I was completely surprised to find such an entertaining movie. I feel that the rating it got from the critics were unfair to the attention and details that were put into this movie. It definitely pays homage to the first 2 movies but also develop it own unique storyline. I didn't find the plot complex at all. If you like time travel movies, then you are in for a ride. I am truly excited to see the next film.Bottom line, don't miss out on this movie. Watching this in 3D is a must.",Terminator Genisys
1027,rjonestm,True to the original movies,9,12 July 2015,"To be honest, i went into this movie with low expectations, as i was reading some negative reviews before i went to the cinemas i did already expected the worse...But, this was not the case at all, this movie really did what fans already wanted to see like a long time ago i would say, while it might be a bit complicated it manages to stay true to it roots and portraits the original John and Sarah Connor in the best possible way, the actors really do a great job portraying them! Not to forget Arnold, he does again a great work playing the support role as a aged terminator.With that said, if your a true terminator fan go and watch it, you wont regret it, top notch action sequences, typical one-liners and a really good cast in my opinion :) Thanks for reading!",Terminator Genisys
1028,irruzzar,please stop making terminator movies,1,12 July 2015,"Well, I watched this movie recently and all I can say is: stop making terminator movies. It's just not fun anymore to watch. Arnold Schwarzenegger is ready for retirement, 67 years old and back again for a terminator role? Come on! From Terminator 3 and after, the story become on his own. For me, but like most of the real terminator fans 1 and 2 are the originals one and that's that. Jason Clarke is such an annoying actor. If I would be a director / producer I would never hire him for a movie. It's really poor to see that people still want to make money out of terminator movies. My advice is: stop it, and create something original.",Terminator Genisys

Nice effects, nice script, not so nice acting, but generally OK.BUT... Terminator movies were originally more survival horror. I remember, being scared and discussed while watching Arnold remove his eye and repair his hand inside a stinky room full of flies in Terminator 1. I remember being scared to death, until the last moment where Sarah crushes the Terminator in the first movie.Where are these scenes? Where are these feelings? Where is the fear? Terminator movies are now more like movies for children. This is not the way they started.",Terminator Genisys
1030,verwirrungpur,Wow! Worst movie I ever saw in the cinema. An insult for every fan of the first two parts!,2,13 July 2015,"So.... I never wrote a review on IMDb, yet, but for this movie I even made an IMDb account.I watched Terminator Genesys in the cinema last Friday and I could not believe what I saw. Trust me: The movie was so bad, that a friend of mine fell asleep and we left out of the cinema before the movie ended because it was just painful to watch. Actually, we are both big terminator fans. The first two are just awesome, the third one is bad and the fourth one was okay. But Genesys is really just an insult for all the fans of the old movies. I can't believe that there are so many positive reviews out here. Did the demands for good entertainment go down so badly these days? I don't even know where to start to complain: The acting was bad. And with bad I mean utterly bad. I could not even recognize Emilia Clarke since she played so bad in that movie. The actor of Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney)was one of the worst I ever saw. Jason Clarke as John Connor was actually the best actor in this movie but a complete miscast for the role of John Connor.The story is horrible. It is driving everything which happened in the parts before ad absurdum and at points it doesn't make any sense at all. I have to regret that there are some quite cool or even funny ideas (that's why I gave two and not one Star), but they made nothing out of these ideas. Despite that: Spraying a T1000 with a bit of acid to dissolve him? Seriously? The action was bad. I saw the movie in 3D. The heads of the actors were deformed and several times you just saw double. The dialogues between the action scenes were boring as hell and full of clichés...Last but not least: The music was awful. I don't know why they pay the Hans Zimmer studios for something so bad. Maybe they should just use stock music and save a lot of money. I know a lot of independent composers who would have done a much better job here. I know the sound of Hollywood has been uniformed within the last years. Even if you just alternate cliché 1-6 chord progressions with standard contemporary orchestral FX you can show at least a bit of creativity. Orchestration wasn't very good either. The music was really one of the worst I've ever heard in the cinema!!! I had to write this down since I was so utterly disappointed by that movie. I would not recommend anybody to watch this movie but I guess my review will not hold any really Terminator fan since there are so many good reviews here... Anyway, you have been warned.",Terminator Genisys
1031,reazhuda,A good movie with twists,7,13 July 2015,Being a Terminator fan. This is a movie that was high in the movie priority list. What people will need to do is have an open mind when watching the movie as a lot happens in a small amount of time.The action and the CGI was perfect. The storyline is perfect and this is what I call a revival of the franchise.Definitely worth watching and opens doors for the franchise to carry on for more to come.Arnie at his best as the Terminator. Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney played there roles which was superb. The only issue is Linda Hamilton has sealed the role of Sarah Connor and I don't think any one can top that or the role of Kyle Reese that was played by Michel Biehn.,Terminator Genisys
1032,aoneko-14332,Fun and Entertaining! And more!,9,13 July 2015,"Everything I expected in an action / adventure movie plus lots of heart. I've been a long time reader of IMDb, and it took a polarizing movie (understandably) like Terminator: Genisys to open an account. As it stands now, fans of the film are rooting for proposed sequels and detractors hope this will continue to flop(?) thus, self terminating.I for one, would love to see how the story unfolds. Many unanswered questions(not plot holes) which were designed to leave us wanting more.Here is an interesting passage from the producer, David Ellision: ""We understand that 'Terminator' is a worldwide franchise,"" Mr. Ellison said in an email on Sunday, ""and we are hopeful that the fans are still as passionate about it as we are.""Why was Mr. Ellison so insistent on moving forward with two sequels and a television spin off before ""Terminator Genisys"" even opened? He explained the strategy by noting that successful series like ""The Lord of the Rings"" were mapped out all at once. ""It's so you don't back yourself into a corner like we've seen some franchises do in the past,"" he said.There's more to the July 5th, New York Times article.

1033,dmahov-93087,I'm glad I saw this,8,14 July 2015,"This movie was great! It pays homage to the Terminator movies before it, the action sequences are exciting and fun and the one liners are pretty good. There are a few cheese-ball moments but it is to be expected with a PG-13 title. The actors do a great job with the characters and it is wonderful to see Arnold still has what it takes to play a physical role like this. My only experience with Jai Courtney is the Divergent series and it's nice to see that he can actually act. Also, Sarah Conner could not have been better cast, I'm not sure I'll be able to watch A Game Of Thrones the same again.I'm glad I saw this movie and I look forward to the rest of the trilogy. I'm also glad to see the Arnold still has it and this franchise still has life left in it. As long as these movies are made, I'll keep watching.",Terminator Genisys
1034,anonymoon-93962,Convoluted Mess: Lacks World-Building Logic/Franchise Heart,1,15 July 2015,"The script is the enemy in Terminator Genesys. It betrays the longtime hope and hero of the series (John Connor), it ties nasty unbelievable knots in the logic and time-travel rules, and it completely undermines the ""do not harm"" morality of Terminator II (civilians are slaughtered by the dozens and hundreds--especially on the freeway--without a second thought.) What a mess and insult to much good that has gone before! The movie clearly missing a leader, an auteur with an artistic vision; it feels much more like a stupid Transformer blow-things-up fight spree than an intelligent sci-fi. And everything but the kitchen sink is thrown into the plot pot (every version of Terminator shows up, like a Saturday Night Live Spoof, not a film that takes itself seriously.) And omg: the amount of heavy-handed exposition given to the poor actors to carry out is just embarrassing! And yet in the scenes where any sane survivor of these time loops would be explaining a mile-a-minute to their cohorts for tactical reasons ... the characters are silently pouting or given to snarky, vague banter; they actually seem to withhold vital information because ... well, they are in a snit. Again, the screen writing is simply horrendous! The cast could have worked well with a script that made sense, a director who had some power to cut to the chase of a good story, and producer/screenwriters who actually understood what made the originals work. They've lost the heart and humanity of the idea -- and replaced those with special effects, every robot gimmick they could think of, endless and boring battles that just repeat and repeat to no avail and well, a convoluted lame mess instead of a carefully constructed alter-world with a message.Shame on them! What a waste of a good franchise!",Terminator Genisys
1035,kurte-33897,Shallow,6,16 July 2015,"Special effects are great. The scenario is emotionally shallow and hollow like a swiss cheese. Poor acting and unconvincing development of relations between the main actors. I did not believe the development of love between Sarah and Reese, mainly because of really bad acting skills of Jai Courtney. He resembles a pumped up pumpkin that somehow learned to speak. Jason Clarke was not given enough space as an actor. He is poorely reduced to an icon of a resistance without the possibility to expose a real emotion. Terminator (Arnold) has become a theoretical physicist, although he gave an excellent performance. J.K. Simmons was very credible. All in all, too many muscles and not enough of a ""street"" credibility from the movies from the eighties.",Terminator Genisys
1036,dirweis,No way!!,2,16 July 2015,"I've been a huge Terminator fan ever since Terminator 2 had its start in the cinemas in 1991. As a matter of fact it has been my favorite movie for many years. And when I watched the first Terminator movie I loved this dark atmosphere in such a superb action movie. With the 3rd part I had my problems with asking myself why the terminators no longer terminate when they have the chance. But anyways, it was a solid action movie. Let's don't talk about the 4th part, you know, it stands for itself, no movie of the Terminator row. But this 5th part... what the... all I can say: They turned the Terminator into a clown! Could anybody please terminate this movie, destroy all copies, using a time machine before it was published to the cinemas? Awful, simply awful what they made out of those once great movies. What a blame for Hollywood.",Terminator Genisys
1037,togoettsche,Great action - again,9,17 July 2015,"Arnold Schwarzenegger - actually the name speaks for itself - guarantees not only great action scenes, but also good fun spread all over this new movie. I really loved it. I read some of the official critiques and reviews, some of them saying the plot were over-complicated or illogical - but ever since the Terminator franchise was created the plots are filled with grandfather paradoxes (a guy sends back another man through time travel who then meets said guy's mother and becomes said man's father, which cannot work, because if he had not fathered the guy in the first place ergo he could not have been sent back in time by his son...), so this is nothing we should really care about and just accept that time travel is possible and can change the present/future and considering this, Terminator Genisys is a bombastic spectacle that you should watch in the pictures. 3D is not necessary, but the sounds are overwhelming! Had a great night watching Arnie come back, but the other cast members earn their applause, too. Emilia Clarke is the perfect mixture of sexiness and toughness, Jason Clarke dangles between mankind's Messiah and Nemesis, Jai Courtney proves that he is more than a action star and we can celebrate J.K. Simmons in a very joyful guest appearance.",Terminator Genisys

I went online to check out some of the reviews, and so many of them were bad, it kind of made me feel like huh, maybe it's gonna suck. I still ended up seeing it (mostly because I'm in love with Emilia Clarke), and I was so surprised by how good it actually was. I have no idea why so many people are giving it negative reviews. While yea, it does kind of deviate away from the original story, but it pays homage to the first 2 movies so many times it doesn't even matter. This was one of the better new terminator movies, definitely ranked higher than 3 and 4.If you're having doubts about seeing this because of people's bad reviews, ignore them. It's definitely worth it!",Terminator Genisys
1039,ichimaru-55955,Much more than I expected,9,20 July 2015,"First of all, I am not a professional critic, so for me the only important question is, if the movie in entertaining or not. And in case of Terminator Genisys, I must say that it was surprisingly highly entertaining for me.I read some bad press about the movie before and believe that the reviewers had either too high expectations or tried to compare the movie to Terminator 1 or 2. I think you should not try to compare movie which are made today to such classics, which had such a long time to build such a huge fanbase. I personally, consider myself a fan of the original movies, but without trying to compare the movie with the old movies, I think that the movie itself is a nice addition to the Terminator franchise.The movie offers a lot of action sequences and these are all very satisfying and entertaining. Regarding the story, no one should expect a sophisticated story, it is an action movie after all, but I found it actually quite satisfying and fitting. Without going into spoilers, I really liked the first minutes, as these are also in line with the story of the original terminal movies.Of course not everything is good, for example the casting of Emilia Clarke (although a good actress) is wrong, as she is missing the toughness the character of Sarah Connor needs and deserves. Another thing is that although not too much distracting, it is obvious that the movie was planned from the beginning for a PG13 rating, which is a unfortunate recent trend with popular franchises.But all in all, when reviewing how entertaining the movie was, I will give it a 9 and hope that this is not the last we have seen of the Terminator franchise, if the other movies are similar entertaining.",Terminator Genisys
1040,rodrigodrt,"Not what we wanted, but better than the expected...",5,21 July 2015,"Being a die hard fan of the Terminator franchise, I, just like anyone else have the urge to compare this release with the previous T1/T2 movies... What to expect? T1 was 'perfect' for whatever the 80's had to offer for the movies industry then, and the same happened with T2, which was my personal favorite, and didn't failed one bit at capturing whatever the era had to offer without falling into an excessively fancy and cliché high-tech envision of ""futurisc"", that which crippled T3/T4 in my opinion, and T5 failed to avoid that unfortunately.. Phase-Matter? What? ""john-minator"" is ridiculous in every possible way... the way he got ""infected"", the way he was turned ""evil"" was just so cliché, baked, simple and convenient to be able to deliver any thrill or plot twist sense that could have saved this character... too bad, John-minator is barely a generic too hi-tech, virtually impervious, unappealing looking (machine appearance)antagonist that will never match any of the previous ones, even the T-X. Human behavior? why even make a terminator that will spend most of its time exulting how the ""good"" guys will never succeed and how it could destroy them in a blink of an eye, but would barely move a finger to finish them asap... why not kill them immediately in the first encounter and get the job done? why all the senseless and needless chatter? On top of that T5 failed explaining things properly, the plot was confusing, the history and all the time traveling was confusing, skynet in fact, seemed confused itself, and whats with the Delorean wholesale? everybody was going back and forth in time as they damn well please and nobody seemed to know where to go or what to do exactly, just destroy skynet, somehow somewhere, so lets just go to a time where its activation is imminent instead of having extra time to prepare... cause you know, the guardian will have 100.000 weapons stored for the THREE of us, and, despite that we know they are useless anyways, and are all going to be destroyed in a single explosion, its going to be exciting! just that not... Acting was good, but does not excels in any point. Emilia Clarke portraited a bold young Sarah, mostly prepared for anything already which makes some sense after being 'raised' by the T800, though ""no man is a machine""... shes just too battle hardened, controlled, fearless, focused for a mere human... T5 Sarah acting isn't 1/10 of that of Linda Hamilton's in T2... Which was phenomenal in my opinion, even though she faced a T800 before, she was never too prepared... she had the full range of emotions that a human would have in her situation.. fear,courage, bias, despair... In Genisys Sarah is actually the terminator, move forward, kill, repeat. As for characters development, again its half baked and purely enforced, why Reese is even there? he doesn't looks like anyone who fought against Skynet his entire life... His relation with Sarah is just so unnatural and mechanic... Argue and argue over again. Suddenly, out of thing air.. they're like, ""You said one thing nice, now I love you so deeply, lets kiss or something"". Needless to mention the other relations, Guardian with Sarah, John with Reese... all watered down and nowhere near the relation development of T2's young John Connor and the T800. Tagline ""Now I know why you cry... but that is something I can never do"", that was AWESOME, i had chills then and still have now... And what do we have for nice quotes in T5? This never ending insistence with the line ""Come with me if you wanna live""... thats just so exhausted... the movie had no thrill at ANY point... and worse, some may relate; there were several occasions where you'd expect a funny joke to break all the boredom built, but then... -Nay-. All you'd get is a move forward line ""lets do it!"". I'll not get into many more details on whats wrong with this movie... but then again, Skynet was already too developed for the era, the holographic appearances and the ""you'll fail after all"" attempts were plain needless and gave too much life to a mere code... Skynet's entity in the future, being the one who ""infected"" John was already at a cliché level of humanly behavior even for that so futuristic environment.This movie wasn't an all out disaster though, Arnie's acting was what I'd expect for his role, not being controversial, his creepy smile, random talk about copulation, the apparent dispute for who would load the clip faster and the final staring at Reese are the saving grace aspects for pulling a laugh or two. aside from John-minator all the other ""T's"" were trying to do their job, the sent back T800 was much more aggressive and willing to kill than that released after John in T4, the T1000 did his job, throwing a javelin was something I did not expected, reanimating the T800 was also what a machine would do to increase the chances of success, yet I understand how it has to be made less efficient than Robert Patrick's one as it was a secondary asset now... So this movie, definitely better than T3 and T4... NOWHERE near T1/T2, but its worth watching if you're fan like me, it has its saving moments, especially for bringing back the scene from T1, a shot of nostalgia, some references here and there. For 1st timers... it will be confusing and an already seen recipe.",Terminator Genisys
1041,nickstavris,demise of the machines,3,24 July 2015,"Terminator: Genisys (2015) reflects the direction that contemporary cinema is and has been heading for some time. Upon seeing the first Transformers movie (2007) directed by Michael Bay - a film which I personally waited for with great patience and anticipation ever since watching the cartoon Autobot leader Optimus Prime as a child – I knew that the digital age, or the era of the computer game-movie had begun. And this development is something which fills me with a sense of genuine sadness. The most recent addition to the Terminator franchise has left me with both disappointment and worry. Leaving aside the overuse of CGI technology and incoherent plot, let us spare a thought for the actors. To their credit, Emilia Clarke (Sarah Connor) and Kai Courtney (Kyle Reese) did their very best given what they had to work with. Let it be known, the failure of this film was a combination of ludicrous SFX and for the most part, absurd writing. The film begins with a recap in the form of Kyle Reese's eerie and war-tired narration, followed by the moment that the original Arnie Terminator, the T-800, travels back in time to 1984 in order to kill Sarah Connor. We then see the response of the resistance led by John Connor (Jason Clarke) as they send Kyle Reese back to the same point in time to protect Sarah from Arnie. OK, so we know what's going on so far – basically what happened in the original film, only from the other side of the time-line. However, once in the past, everything has changed, and this is where it all starts to go a little bit pear shaped. It turns out, at some point in the future, a 'good guy' Arnie has already been sent back to protect Sarah, so that when 'bad guy' Arnie arrives, he is confronted with the challenge of fighting himself. If you are confused at this point, it gets worse. We are then faced with the Liquid Man, the T-1000 from Terminator 2 (sadly not Robert Patrick) who 'good guy' Arnie, Kyle and Sarah must also battle. Despite the fact that the liquid man was almost indestructible in the second film, he plays a far more diminished role this time around. Following the destruction of the evil androids, who are taken care of with relative ease by Arnie – who Sarah has uncomfortably nicknamed 'Pops' (Yes, I know), Sarah and Kyle then travel forwards in time to the year 2017 (using a machine that in true 'here's one I made earlier' fashion, Arnie and Sarah have lying around) in order to destroy Skynet before it goes live. Unfortunately, for both the characters and the long suffering audience, a new Robot has emerged, as if from nowhere, in the form or John Connor himself. It turns out that in the moments of Kyle's departure from 2029 to 1984, Connor was attacked by Skynet who have infiltrated the resistance camp and somehow turned him into a Terminator – calling on and at the same time destroying all the good work done in Terminator Salvation – where Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) is both man and machine. The assimilation of John Connor here is not presented nearly as well. During all this, the characters spend most of the film trying, in rather clumsy fashion, to explain the time travel problems to the viewer, and pointing some severely hypocritical fingers at contemporary cultures' fascination with technology such as smart phones, tablets and apps. The Genisys of Genisys is an app that will connect everyone to the technological world seamlessly. This idea is portrayed in a memory form another time-line that comes to Kyle as he travels through time. The film ends in fairly predictable fashion – and the less said about it the better.The mistakes that Alan Taylor (Director) has made are the same ones made by George Lucas with Star Wars – prioritising technology over heart. The first Terminator film scared the living daylights out of us, in spite of the crude technology available at the time. I am still on the edge of my seat when Sarah is being chased by the machine in the final and horrifying section of the film. Judgement Day, the best of the franchise, leaves you feeling fulfilled in terms of characterisation, plot and entertainment. But this new addition goes two steps backwards, literally, in that it reminds the viewer that Terminator 3 actually happened, a film that we had all managed to find 'salvation' from with the fourth instalment. What saddens me most about Genisys is that it could have been so much better. There were moments that I believed it might have been. The fight scenes are impressive, and a welcome relief from the awkward 'banter' between the characters. Arnie proves that he still has what it takes to kick some serious metal ass, or at the very least his body double does. Also, when Kyle first arrives back in 1984, there is a very subtle moment he checks the size of a boot against his own foot – a shrewd nod to the original – it's just a shame that this film tries to sell us a pair of Nike trainers in the process. Overall, this film has forgotten what the fans of the franchise fell in love with, the combination of horror, sci-fi and action. Instead, Genisys expects us to laugh at the truly terrible attempts made at combining everything we enjoyed about the originals with comedy. At no point in the first two film did I laugh, not even at the 'hasta la vista' bit – because that too was a moving moment between potential father and a potential son. Tragically, I feel this film marks the end of the Terminator, something which probably should have happened when John Connor threw the chip and the skeletal-metal arm into the molten steel, and where Arnie's raised thumb sinks along with them.",Terminator Genisys
1042,koolkid-85857,In Awe,10,23 July 2015,"This movie isn't just breathtaking. It's simply ecstasy. To think, the mind behind that one Lost episode and the most recent Thor movie could take such an overrated movie series and completely transform it. Alan Taylor and his amazing writers took the once ""amazing"" Terminator series, stuffed it in a body bag and chucked it down the deepest, darkest quarry they could find. The completely new Terminator experience now includes: impeccable CGI, a really old, outdated actor guy (Arnold Shawarma or something) and of course, all of your once favorite characters revamped and more angst-y than ever. The movie itself consists of big explosions, a couple small ones and some really pretty big ones, I cant help but give a hand to them for those. Every character ever named in the series makes a big comeback in this movie ( of course with new, hip actors ) along with a handful of new characters, played by special guest stars Dr. Phil and Bert Bushnell. I end my heartfelt love letter to Terminator: Genysys with an unadulterated 10/10, you simply cannot continue your pointless, boorish life without this chick flick.",Terminator Genisys

This should have actually been the third chapter instead of the fifth. i especially enjoyed how they took it all the way back to the Los Angeles scenes from the first part. They hit the money on those scenes. They made it look just how it was back in the 80's which is nothing how it looks in present day 2015. Schwarzenegger was classic with his two word liners and cheesy smiles.. oh and that sudden twist, oh wow, i never suspected that ever... Threw me right off my feet... loved it... i do hope they continue the story line. Even my wife loved it which surprised me, because she's more into those chick flick films.",Terminator Genisys
1044,skmurguia,Love this movie! Watch it - make your own opinion - IGNORE the Critics,10,28 July 2015,"SPOILER ALERTS – I tried to keep it as general as possible, but it was still inevitable.This movie got a lot of bad reviews, mostly because people are saying that it completely undoes Terminator 1 and 2. This is the wrong way to view Terminator Genisys, and so here are my 2 cents.It is true that Terminator Genisys does impact what happened in movies 1 and 2, but this new installment is in no way a reboot, and it actually pays tribute to the first 2 movies. Terminator Genisys was done in a very smart way that gave us a new story without tarnishing the first 2 movies.Let me back up. Movie 1 takes place in 1984 when Skynet sends back a terminator to kill Sarah Connor before she gives birth to John Connor. Skynet fails. So, in movie 2, Skynet sends a terminator back to a point later in time to kill John Connor when he is a child. Skynet fails again. Skynet can see that sending terminators back in time to later points isn't working, so the most logical thing to do (it's artificial intelligence – they operate using logic), if going back in time to later points in time leads to failure, the next logical step would be to send a terminator back in time to an earlier point. And that is exactly what Skynet does. The problem is that by Skynet sending a terminator back to a point prior to 1984 will inevitably affect what happens in 1984 and later. So I can see how people are upset by this and insist that Terminator Genisys undoes movies 1 and 2. But here's the thing: the characters are well versed in what happened in 1984 and later, they know what went down, or will go down – Terminator Genisys NEVER disregards those first 2 installments and kept everything in the knowledge the characters have, both present and future. But, this is time travel, and the events that take place will be impacted by a traveler from the future and things will change. After all, isn't changing the future part of the premise of the first 2 installments. A premise this movie stands by throughout.This movie also stayed true to one other element that highlights the very name of the franchise: Terminator. The purpose of the terminator is to terminate. If it gets a hold of you, it kills you. If you get in its way, it kills you. That's what terminators do, it's in the name. This was one of the biggest reasons I hated Terminator Salvation, because the terminators went around beating up and flinging people around instead of just killing them when they got them. The whole point about the original three movies was to outsmart the terminators because if they got you, you were dead – end of story. And Terminator Genisys stayed true to it.So, don't hate the movie because it alters the history of the first 2 movies. Instead see it for what it is, a tribute to both that has managed to recapture the very elements that made the first 2 movies so awesome. Terminator Genisys was done in a very smart way, honoring the old while beginning anew. I give the writers props for that. The director did a great job directing. The special effects were amazing. And the acting – those were some big shoes to fill and these actors definitely did the original actors justice. Give this movie a chance, go see it keeping in mind that Skynet is only doing the next logical thing and that time travel will alter the future, and make your own opinion of it.I for one loved this movie so much I'm going back to see it again tonight :-)",Terminator Genisys

1046,jarekczarnecki,"WOW, IMDb rating is a joke",1,31 July 2015,"I am so disgusted with this movie and its rating that I have decided to sign up here for the first time and write my opinion. There is no way this movie is a 7.0/10. Not even close and it never will be. If this is a 7.0 then Salvation is a 14.0/10. James Cameron should be ashamed for even entertaining the idea that this movie is good. He has made me realize that everyone can be bought for the right amount. I hope he got paid a lot of money to say ""If you are a terminator fan, you will love this movie"", because he has lost a lot of respect with that statement. Hope it was worth it James!I waited for this movie every day counting down as the days go by. I went to see it with my wife and I felt sorry for her she had to sit through the eye ball torture. I wanted to walk out a couple of times after countless cheesy jokes and terrible acting but I didn't. I thought I would stick through it because it has to get better until I witnessed the helicopter scene. At that moment I realized that the terminator franchise is nothing more than a childhood dream. Anyone who rated this movie above 3 stars on here is either getting paid by someone or 13 years old since after all it was a PG-13 movie.Terminator 1 was good. I rate 8/10.Terminator 2 was great. I rate 9/10.Terminator 3 was decent, hated the overly futuristic female T-X. Ending was good and we finally see Judgement Day. I rate 6/10.Salvation was good once you got passed Bale's Batman voice. At least it was getting into the future war and heading the right direction after T3. No fancy robots, just cold steel cyborgs with one acceptable twist (Marcus). The T600 was awesome. I rate 7/10.Than comes Genisys, a Saturday Night Live skit at best. Was this a wannabe comedy or a terminator movie? We have a Kyle Reese that is cocky and looks like he should be the Terminator. Probably worst acting I have seen in a movie. We have John Connor that is some weird combination of human/nano technology/robot/liquid metal that is so far out there that it is stupid. Yes, stupid. We have the new Sarah which is not so bad other than the weird interactions between her and Kyle. It was awkward at best. We have Pops who is the terminator who is a father figure and competes with Kyle for his ""daughter's"" approval. He awkwardly smiles a lot and repeats the same punch lines over and over as if we didn't get it the first 6 times. It is border line offensive to average human intelligence. Add to that ridiculous scenes like the helicopter chase towards the end which defies logic and I am ready to question anyone's intelligence who rates this movie as anything above a joke.Some people say ""it was a fun summer flick, lighten up and just enjoy it for the action"". What action? The crap CGI all over and helicopters from starwars? The T800s looked better in the originals. I wanted to enjoy it and went in with an open mind not expecting much but I wasn't prepared for what I actually witnessed. It was the worst summer flick I have ever seen that has actually insulted me for wanting to watch it. (if that's even possible) It was a joke and a mockery at best. It can't be taken seriously even if you wanted to. It fails at being a terminator movie. It fails at being a ""true sequel to T1&T2"". It fails at being funny. It fails at having ground breaking CGI. If fails at having a story. It fails at character development. It fails at having good sound effects. The music is TERRIBLE! It even destroys the prequels timelines which I don't care for really if it was good. It has nothing going for it. I walked out of the theater dumbfounded at what I have just watched. My wife laughed at me and said ""this is what you waited for all these months? WOW. Terminator 2 is still my favorite.""",Terminator Genisys
1047,caseyjasontee,Terminator Goes Parent Trap,1,3 August 2015,"Long gone are the good old days when the Terminator movies used to be a sci-fi thriller. The genre has been completely changed into a family action adventure movie, where many of the jokes seem to appeal to little kids like trying to make a robot smile. There was nothing thrilling about any of the action sequences, as they were all too similar to other big studio films from the past. The terminator battling himself had as much thrill as Lindsay Lohan fencing against herself at summer camp in the Parent Trap.The Guardian terminator seemed overly concerned about having Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor have a child, as he repeatedly asks ""Did you mate?"" He wants the two to get together and set the way for John Connor's parents. The emotional attachment Sarah Connor shows to Pops by hugging him is like one of the twins from Parent Trap hugging her parent.The trailers seemed to indicate that it was still a sci-fi thriller, but that was not the case.",Terminator Genisys
1048,johnbyrge-87157,Terminator Genisys was great,10,6 August 2015,OK let me start with saying this movie was awesome. A lot of people have been giving it flak and they just don't have a clue or are just talking to hear their own voice. I grew up watching the terminator movies and with the exception of 3 and 4 they are easily some of the best viewing experiences. The order should go Terminator 1 Terminator 2 Judgment Day and now Terminator Genisys. You will not be disappointed great movie.Emilia Clarke is just the go to actor if you want beauty and brains with acting ability she has a full career ahead of her she just has this way of sucking you into her roles and this was no exception. And Arnold Schwarzenegger blew it away as usual another great actor more so when he puts his heart into a project. Jason Clarke and Jai Courtney were great as well i wasn't sure about this movie because of the negative press but as usual the press was dead wrong.,Terminator Genisys
1049,rctsweed,Predictable and terrible pacing,4,9 August 2015,I want my money back... terminator genisys is so incredibly predictable and intense that you feel like it's a 11 hour movie crammed into 2 hours. I like it how they tried to create an alternate time - line but it just falls flat on its face... and the CGI Arnold looks like it was made in 2001 for that crappy final fantasy movie. Overall I think people only like it because of nostalgia blindness. My father went on to saying that it was the best movie of 2015 until I told him all the flaws with it. Sure it may be better than terminator salvation but it's still not a good movie and I want my money back. The plot is flawed and predictable the pacing is terrible and the characters feel boring and underpowered which is so stressful. Even the t- 800 feels weak in this movie.,Terminator Genisys
1050,psychepm,Pleasantly surprised,8,10 August 2015,"After having seen the trailers I was not expecting much from this movie, but I have just finished watching it and I find myself with a big smile on my face and feeling it was time well spent. Nothing much has come from the franchise since T2 and every outing since has been something of a let down,but this is a refreshing change of pace that doesn't take itself too seriously and pokes fun at itself throughout. Anyone over analyzing it will find plenty of plot holes and be able to break it down with its faults. Don't go into this expecting a classic piece of cinema, just go along for the ride you may find yourself pleasantly surprised.",Terminator Genisys
1051,kewlfaraz,They didn't had to make it.....!,2,12 August 2015,"The storyline is flawed, it has been since the judgment day. I do not see any development in the story line whatsoever. If it was to be rebooted they had a very good chance to put things right, there is a huge fan following and so much potential in the story. But again its a mess and they are transforming the franchise into a B- grade.They have to have Sarah Conner, Kyle Reese and John Conner in all of them and it revolves around them. There was no character development. If it has to be a robot who looks like Arnold every time, there has to be a connection to this character in the future. Why is he so important to Sarah and John? They did show emotional development in Arnold but failed to capitalize on it. Lets not forget John Conner sent a robot in the judgment day, which would mean that in future somehow humans get their hands on robots and can make them fight for them. They are unable to show machines fighting for humans in the future.I would have loved to see humans failing against sky-net as it is a software that is so intelligent that it is wiping them out. And humans to develop some sort of algorithm or virus that can actually make machines develop emotions like humans. Machines fighting along with humans and then defeating sky-net through something that is not war. If it has to be these characters then there should be development in them, connecting dots, answering questions...!This movie is all but an action sequences with shallow storyline, this part is missing big time. They have to understand that fans want more than just action sequences....!This movie does not add anything to quench our thirst, it would be better if they had not made it in the first place.Highly disappointed!",Terminator Genisys
1052,sergiugabrielstan,A true successor for the franchise,8,12 August 2015,"Let me say this, I was mindblown how great this movie turned out to be. When I first saw the trailer i was sure it was gonna be a total train wreck but everything plays out so good.So what makes this one in the franchise good? The ""subtle"" story elements. The movie is packed with scenes from Terminator 1 and 2 and nothing is out of place, it gives a bigger depth to the whole timeline ark. When Kyle Reese goes back in time he seems surprised like it isn't what he would expect it to be, nor how we remember it. He then meets a much younger Sarah Connor, so we would assume that this takes place before terminator 1, but there's also T-1000 and Arnold who is playing house with Sarah. So whats up with that? This is an alternate timeline where the evens of terminator 1 and 2(probably also 3) are just unfolding but with a different take and we can see that in almost every scene, for instance when the T1000 dies like the terminator from the 1st movie, or Arnold playing babysitter with Sarah Connor instead of her son.Now im not gonna spoil more of the movie , or other references, I'll let you find them, but overall great movie, recommend it. 8/10",Terminator Genisys
1053,ghc_marquis,They managed to make a sequel worst that the last two Terminator films,2,14 August 2015,"This does not feel like a Terminator filmThe Terminator(1984) followed a cyborg blending in with the public and attempting to terminate its target Sarah Connor. The hard hitting suspense and genuine fear of the villain that could not be killed is what made this film so memorable. When people died is was shocking, the people on screen reacted as though it was a human committing these acts. T2 built on this and also focused on the relationship with the Terminator and John Connor. Both powerful awesome action films that are still as good today as ever were. What happened... Terminator 5 basically decides that its 2015 so lets make a film about tablets, electronic devices and stupid over the top action scenes that make me, the viewer not give a f**k about anyone who dies and makes a P**s poor on screen relationship between Emilia Clarke and Jai (so whack) Courtney. The film does show so attempt of the Terminator having to survive alone for 30 years for the return of Sarah and Kyle. But regardless of this it felt hollow and painful to watch as there was just no heart involved. If you want to watch a film that has so many plot holes and just plain stupid conclusion this is the perfect film.I love Arnie but this film is not worth anyone's time. Its Donkey Balls. Spoiler: And John Connor being the f**king bad guy that's now a Terminator... That idea blows a**. Seriously that's sucks so bad. And Jai Courtney.. Adam Sandler would have been better and he is the pinnacle of whack.",Terminator Genisys
1054,russellp-16242,Unfathomable rubbish - unforgivable. Slight spoiler,1,13 August 2015,"Absolute disaster.Following the stunning first two films and creation of a genre and my favourite movies of all time - 3 was weak, 4 was OK in its own right but still not really up to par.Had hopes for this one, but am sad to report it is absolutely dire. The story makes no sense whatsoever and desecrates the first movie. We're left with a scenario where epic scenes from the first movie (in fact, almost all of the events from the first movie) didn't happen anymore - they ripped it up, taking a dump on their own doorstep in the process.The special effects are poor and not even up to the standard of T2 which was what, 24 years ago? Further, they have managed to turn John Connor (not just a hero but the SAVIOUR OF THE HUMAN RACE) into a weird, cartoonish arch villain. The new Sarah Connor is the girl from Game of Thrones, where they played on her attractiveness and gave her a commanding role and dialogue - neither of which they bothered with here.A shameless vehicle for Arnie in his sixties - they moved judgement day to 2017 for his convenience and in order to bring in a tenuous Iphone/Ipad link - and this is the worst part of all - they have, inexplicably, outrageously, made Skynet into an Iphone app gone wrong. Presumably the target audience's attention span has not lasted this long and they're staring gormlessly into their Iphones with their mouths open at this point, so nothing lost.The arrogant buck chasing of the producer is hard to stomach for me. Is nothing sacred? Hollywood needs to stop messing with the classics.",Terminator Genisys

Your watching a film about cyborgs, I don't recall seeing one in my local shop recently, this film is supposed to be over the top and full of inconceivable action and it doesn't disappoint, the actors are great the action is awesome and the story line and plot twists blew my mind, this film should of been terminator 3, the only gripe I have is that I think they could of chose a better actor to play kyle Reece he looked to much like a terminator himself,someone closer to the original kyle Reece would of been better, other than that it was awesome, watch it you won't be disappointed :)",Terminator Genisys

I give this new entry of the Terminator story an 8, because somethings in the movie left a few plot holes but I would assume that all those holes will be filled once the next film is written which I am excited for.I suggest if you are a true fan of The Terminator to go and see it and also remember that this is a reboot and they are aiming for a new time-line of events. The movie does a great job of incorporating new and old elements into The Terminator universe which worked out well, and one must remember that this is a movie about time travel where possibilities are abundant.",Terminator Genisys
1057,howelljw-39868,Great!!,10,19 August 2015,"I will start by telling you why the haters have panned this film/movie. To them T2 was the final film of the franchise. They don't want a sequel and anything that tries will be an abomination in their eyes. This film never stood a chance with them. If you feel the same don't waste your time with this film! Then people wouldn't be put off by your bad reviews! T2 was 1 of my favourite films growing up, I must of watched it hundreds of times and I loved it! 10 out 10. Now Terminator Genesis, wow! What a film. It delivers in every way T2 did and more. Great action, great story and great punchlines delivered at the perfect time. The acting is what you would expect from people who get paid millions to do so. The special effect are exactly what you expect from a big budget sci-fi these days. With a special mention to the CGI on the T-800 from T1 which is breathtaking! Don't be put off by the haters unless you are one!!!",Terminator Genisys
1058,javier_rooster,The Terminator franchise is finally dead,1,23 August 2015,"This was a cinema abortion.First: bad actors. And although I saw it coming, this Sarah Connor looked like a kitten compared to the Sarah from The Judgment Day.Second: the use of CGI was too exaggerated. Everything from water, to smoke, and even buildings looked out of place. I guess all the visual FX money was destined to the animations of John Connor.Third and most important: the storyline is full of pointless complications and incoherences... why not sticking to the Salvation's storyline? Why not going deeper into the war to see how it progresses? NO, they had to send someone back through time AGAIN. That was absurd.As a summary: in my opinion, Genisys was far worst than Rise of the Machines (the third one).",Terminator Genisys
1059,lennywan,"9 for Popcorn, 5 for Movie",7,23 August 2015,"It's more like a Marvel series movie.The good thing is you can get more sequels if you like it. However if compared to the first two James Cameron movies, those are complete artwork, and this is popcorn. The difference is 1 and 2 try to portrait characters in drama scenes, while Genisys tries to create a superhero world concept.It's hard to say whether it is a bad idea or not. The problem Terminator series have is that it's too ""complete"", you love it but you don't get any more. With what starts in Genisys, you can create a lot of things and write totally different stories, featuring T-800 sometimes showing up as an icon.But I don't like they starting these new things with Arnie, because T1 and 2 are simply art(especially T2), and then Arnie would actually leave this series with a sequel least of art? I think you can discuss Rambo 4(Director's Edition) about art, like it or not, because the movie is about the character and quite complete. But Genisys is not about a core character. Instead it is about a game and roles playing in it. I don't complain about the script writing. It's a bit confusing but still interesting. But speaking of art, they should have made the movie tougher to give characters strength, otherwise just make it a Leon the Professional style to show the changes time has made in a designed silent killing machine. There are many ways to make a fantasy a serious work, but none of them are included in this one.",Terminator Genisys
1060,tenminhlaanh,This is the worst episode in the Terminator series,2,25 August 2015,"Although the effect is quite beautiful but staged covering the action drama fetched, I do not like the way the actors act. I saw Arnold Schwarzenegger say something witty about age, it really humane. But when the characters just to waste time arguing and trying to destroy the 3D virtual image does not really threaten them, bullshit. Police Terminator always quick and unexpected, but not in this episode, he warned Kyle alert and attack later. I do not understand why John Terminator (John robot) talk too much nonsense. He just said to conceal the purpose, when the truth came out that he should just act.I expect Kyle Reese wise, calm, decisive - qualities of soldier Kyle and Sarah Battle But here are aggressive, abrupt and very agitated - young and very simple!

In some parts of this film the cgi really looks stunning like I haven't seen a lot lately. The only thing that annoyed me was In the beginning when Kyle walks up the stairs and has his pants still on and when he steps on the platform suddenly his pants are off.

And they did.Unbelievable. The Terminator format has definitely dried up. The storyline makes no sense at all. The 70 year old Schwarzenegger is a laugh.

1064,musichan-89401,Terminator 2015 most underrated film,10,12 September 2015,"The way critics are underrating this film is criminal.I have watched all terminator films (including the Sarah Connor chronicles which was fantastic but ahead of its time - hence never got appreciated) and i can honestly say this film had me captivated all the way through. Never lost interest. More than i can say for the new avengers film, which even though i love marvel comics, was still rubbish.Some say why isn't Sarah Connor as hardened as she should be? Well in this time-line she has had a killer robot as a teddy bear protecting her since she was a kid. She did not need to plan/scheme/over train. Whereas in the original time-line after the events of T1 she had to train and remain vigilante until T2. Which hardened her.some say its stupid that the time he goes back to is warped and is unrealistic.Really because time travel is such a known and defined field. Were very sorry the film writers didn't write a plot that was similar to your understanding of time travel! I think the best way to look at it is this: The events of terminator 1 and 2 are the original time-line, good story, believable, not complex, but as the characters keep traveling back in time cycle after cycle the plot gets a lot more complex. A cache of information is developed and sent back every single time which then alters everything (from the time to get sent back to, the character personalities (nature/nurture argument), etc) What was once true of the terminator series is now obsolete. Terminator 3 & 4 could both be alternative time-lines. Some time-lines are closer to the first cycle but some veer off.Some say its stupid that they went forward in time/that they stole from the Sarah Connor chronicles. Or they did a poor job of imitating the Sarah Connor chronicles.The Sarah Connor chronicles was great stuff and well made and could still pass today as a fresh series. However it never got the exposure it should have. A story line that great could do with being retold. Hence parts of this film similar to the series. Plus they couldn't do a great job of fitting two seasons of TV in one film. Can you blame them!Then again the Sarah Connor chronicles could be another time- line. hence the similarities in plot.The film is very good. John Connor as the bad guy is refreshing. Who sent Arnie back to Sarah aged 9?? we still don't know. Clearly from this we can see there has been more than one cycle of events. The fight scenes between the terminators are much more real. No more frustrating tossing each other about (like in all the previous terminator films) when terminators attack they clearly go to land a blow.All in all the critics need to stop attacking this film. Its clearly conspiracy the way they are.",Terminator Genisys
1065,luisfiloliveira-62220,Disapointent... They could have done better...,3,23 September 2015,"First, Jay Courtney is simply awful, how on earth can that guy play the character Kyle Reese? A face shaved, smart dope with no suffering in his eyes at all, miles away the original Kyle, he gave no charisma at all to the movie ( as in all his other movies as well ).The dude that played John Conner was alright, but even Emilia that played Sarah could have done a little better, the lines of there dialogue didn't help either.The action sequences aren't that bad, but nothing iconic like T2 or T1.The other thing that was horrible was the vibe and soundtrack of the movie! it was horrible... In terminator 1 and 2, right from the beginning you had a dark tone of the movie, kind of a little scary, the actors and the hole movie gave and passed out a sense of fear thru out the flick.Like when Arnold arrived on T1 you had that original scary background tone, and then in T2 again a kind of metal scary theme playing... On this movie? stupid, to was like you where at the opera, hearing 100 instruments, that's how you do it dumb director, simple basic tone, to create a scary feeling, not a hole band like your seeing a fight between rocky and mister T... I just hate when these directors don't grasp the vibe of certain movies... The only good part of the this movie was when the re-did the first arrival on T1, that was the only part where this movie gave out the right vibe... But the first fight scene ( it's a trailer online) between the T800 and T101 was pathetic, in the first movie kyle shot him with 3 or 4 shots of shotgun and he went on the floor for a few seconds, on this one T800 shots at him and he still runs towards him??? What a load of crap...The story line isn't that bad, the problem is in the details, like soundtrack, ambiance and definitely in casting...James Cameron for example in the first Terminator, with practically no special effects made a lot more scary, believable and action movie 50 times better then this retard director did with all the CGI that is available...Like I said, the only good part of this movie was when they recreated the t101 arrival in the first terminator. My advise would be, when the movie hits that part, stop it and go watch the one that was made more than 30 years ago cause it is extremely better without a doubt.",Terminator Genisys

You want real carnage, killing, and action. Turn on CNN. How dare James Cameron create something that is just nonstop action. He should better study time travel, before making a movie concerning it. Maybe he can consult the idiots here who are just stupid enough to criticize it, because you are all quantum physicist who have created time travel.

Doesn't even deserve a 1/10. Schwarzenegger must've either been bored off his rear or paid a heck of a lot of money to do this movie. It's a total ruin to James Cameron's legacy to his original 3 terminator movies. If you producer and script guys are reading this ... I would've taken that script, taken a crap on it and lit it on fire on your damn desk. I'm so glad I didn't go pay the 15 bucks a ticket to see this movie. I'm ashamed to have watched this movie. Not worth another 2 hours of my life to watch it again. James Cameron ... I feel sorry for you your legacy fell to such ruin.",Terminator Genisys
1072,marksez-75851,"It's a Fun Movie, Not a Great Movie",7,23 November 2015,"This movie doesn't compare with the ""real"" Terminator movies, ""Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2"" which were great stories, well told, and wonderfully presented works of art. This movie is just a movie like many others with lots of cute dialogue and CGI action. So, if you're looking for more of T2's art and creativity you won't find it in this movie. Still, we really liked it for what it was. The movie does a nice job of recreating the original story and familiar scenes then giving us a twist. That part was neat. The rest of the movie, absent some of the long dialogue, was fun to watch, and that's why we watch these kinds of movies. So it's not James Cameron, but we do get old Arnie and lots of cool scenes and funny/cute dialogue. That's enough for my money. This movie will not go down in movie history as great, just fun.",Terminator Genisys
1073,poorna-16334,"Yes, It is too much different from the story.. ""Terminater""",8,2 December 2015,"This story flows with its origins. But this new film contains different story. john Connor is to be a war hero from its beginning. Not to be an enemy. John Connor is the main enemy? why is that? by the way this film has different taste. there is a matter that Kyle Rees came from the future when his childhood he is existing. and the world is different from the usual. All robots came same time, that is not understandable. the pops came to save Sarah Connor in her childhood. there is no mention about who sent him or what was going on there. Any way this film is good and I love it. Must be another film soon. Can't wait for that.",Terminator Genisys
1074,highchon,One of the worst movies i have ever seen,2,19 December 2015,They took all of the previous movies and created a mash potatoes out of them and that is in a summary the new movie. Waste of time. The first half movie one needs to stop and rewind to understand the mess of time jumps from one time point to another. At some points i have asked myself if the actors understand what they are talking about. At the second half of the movies there is more action as one may expect from this kind of a movie. But again its based on themes taken from previous movies. Example would be when Sara Connor faces two Kile Reese trying to convince her they are the real Kile Reese. And many other like these examples could be notes. There is too fast shift from one scene to the other that creates a feeling of a mess and no depth or value to the overall movie.,Terminator Genisys
1075,antisouless,The perfect Terminator movie.,9,26 February 2016,"So the only issue I found, is that the trailers spoiled whoshisface being the bad guy. I think if they had hid that better it would have been a much better surprise. But that's it. I found the ending, the humor, the action, and the overall story to be near perfect in terms of what I expected. I suppose my review is based on my expectations vs quality of the product. The only reason I don't give it a 10 is some of the CGI and the ruining of whoshisface being a bad guy. If they had done it better and hid it. I would have been much more happy with it. Also why can't you get back Robert Patrick, that blonde woman, and rehabilitate Edward Furlong? Just nitpicking though. It's an amazing movie. I watched T1, T2, and T3 long ago and have forgotten if they are as good. I don't care. This movie is good and you should watch it. In closing. The last thing in the movie is the ending. And thus I will discuss how pleasant I found it. It was perfect. No cliff- hanger whatsoever. No ""hey now go see the sequel"". Just a satisfying ending. Don't care about nit-picking plot-holes in regards to the entire series, or even the movie. It was good.",Terminator Genisys
1076,sirtrodgers,Destroys the events of the other films,2,4 January 2016,"Terminator Genisys: A strange and nonsensical film that destroys all that happens in pretty much every other film in the series. Let's begin.It starts off with a narration by Kyle Reese about judgment day, which occurred on: August 29, 1997??? Apparently Sarah, John, and the T-101's efforts to alter the future were completely pointless. And also, in Terminator 3, didn't judgment day occur in 2003? It explains that Kyle met war hero John Connor while being ambushed by a terminator as a child. But didn't John meet Kyle at the terminator factory as a teenager? So I guess Salvation didn't happen? But apparently it did because John had the scar he got from it. So anyway, John sends Kyle back to 1984, like the events of the first masterpiece. But then the eleventh doctor (Skynet) shows up and attacks John, merely seconds before Kyle is transported to 1984. So time has been altered because a terminator was sent to kill Sarah as a child but a reprogrammed T-101 comes to Sarah's past and saves her, and acts as a father figure to her. Kyle shows up, the T-101 (""Pops"") and Kyle childishly (and unfunnily) argue. Sarah says that they should use their time machine and travel to 1997 to stop judgment day. But Kyle says they should travel to 2017 to stop Skynet because judgment day now occurs in 2017 because of the change in time. So they travel to 2017 where we find the roots of Skynet: a social network-y thing called Genisys that is also integrated in defense systems???? But Kyle and Sarah are arrested but all of a sudden John shows up. So they chat and stuff when Pops comes and shoots John. Turns out Skynet made John into a terminator and now he's the villain. So there's a bunch of explosions, chase scenes, and bad music. The climax takes place in John's prototype time machine that is magnetic and Pops (hurts me every time I have to say that name) takes down John in the time machine and it blows up Cyberdyne HQ. Parts of Pops fall into liquid metal Robert Patrick goop and is assumed dead. But no, that would just be too sad. Instead, he is somehow ""upgraded"" and the credits roll. And that's Terminator Genisys. Definitely skip this one.",Terminator Genisys
1077,baerphil,Awesome,10,14 December 2017,10 out of 10. For those of you who gave this movie one star you are idiots. A very nostalgic movie with great twists. Who cares if it copied some of the older episodes. That's what's made it so good.,Terminator Genisys
1078,lassekissowh,You're robbing yourself of an experience,7,21 July 2020,"For a franchise that's been losing steam for the past 23 years, this film really did a great job in bringing some new energy to the Terminator-franchise.It takes the story and plot in a new and interesting direction and at the same time keeps familiar elements to please hardcore Terminator-fans.The movie obviously has some flaws especially concerning John Connor's character, but overall it's an entertaining watch that is visually stunning. It has great cinematography, great action sequences and a breathtaking score by Hans Zimmer and to top it off, it has Arnold who - even though he looks older - is nowhere near obsolete. ;-)",Terminator Genisys
1079,freerunner,Bad .. really bad ..,1,1 November 2018,"I think that is my first ever review, but I just couldn't help it. This movie was really baaad.",Terminator Genisys
1080,RandomDoge,Very enjoyable and entertaining movie!,10,11 August 2016,"I watched this movie in 2016 from a Bluray Disc in 3D and the experience was awesome. It's not necessary to talk about the special effects and advanced CGI used in movies these days, because everyone knows that. The movie didn't get many fans to walk to the theatre and watch it, the BO was not so big but I loved the movie. The story is a bit hard to understand at first with all the different time-lines and time travelling but overall it's a very enjoyable movie with good and also pretty funny script and action. Arnold Schwarzenegger in the role of the ""old but not obsolete"" T-800 is great, nothing more to say. If you didn't watch this movie already, it's worth watching considering it'll most probably be the last movie in the franchise.",Terminator Genisys
1081,terminatorfan-84466,thanks for ruining the story!!!,1,5 September 2016,I had so much hope for this movie to hold it's own to Terminator 2. Not even close. Terminator 1 and Terminator 2 are really the only movies that were any good. Terminator 2 was amazing and the rest including Genisys were big let downs. CAN YOU PLEASE make a valid sequel to T2 please?Every time a new sequel comes out everyone gets so excited and then the movie comes out and is like watching clone wars for star wars. I mean why cant the whole thing be rewritten after 2? Make it more time travel real world related. Make it along the lines of writing your own fate. Then eventually a new piece of the terminator technology is found and sky net is rediscovered... Something like that anyways. No More twists that do not make sense.,Terminator Genisys
1082,prasetya-43576,Critic ? No way for big fan,7,17 November 2016,"I may be one of the flock, but I am a big fan of the Terminator franchise. This movie was appropriately delivered to fans of the franchise more than the prior 2 sequels. Arnold was Arnold and genuinely looked like he was having fun with the role. The story to me was pretty well written and despite lots of turns along the way, was engaging. There was plenty of comic relief. The battle scenes play homage to the aesthetic and look of the future wars in the 1st two movies.Emilia Clarke did a pretty good job of playing Sarah Connor although she might have been a little softer looking than Linda Hamilton, I think the justification of the plot makes you understand a little more of how and why she is the way she is.",Terminator Genisys
1083,jrotccadet,Exactly as bad as I thought it would be.,1,18 February 2017,"This is (very) easily the worst film in the franchise. The plot feels very minimal and forced, and does everything it can to undo all the progress of the previous four movies. The level of technology achieved by SkyNet in this movie is beyond the amount of suspension of disbelief I could have for any sci-fi movie, where John Connor is essentially converted into a cloud of micro-robots that can form into humanoid shapes and can only be dispersed/destroyed by extreme magnetism. And... somehow Arnold's terminator fights this by making a magnet glove out of a lamp post? How does that work?Putting that all aside, there's no visual continuity. Say what you want about Terminator 3, but the actor who played Connor in that film (Nick Stahl) does have a bit of resemblance to the original Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), and you believe he's Kyle's son. Jason Clarke and Jai Courtney look nothing alike. Speaking of Kyle, in the original Terminator he was lean, but muscular, and looked like a soldier but not too buff for someone who'd supposedly starved most of his life. Courtney, who plays Kyle in this film, looks like he hits the gym every morning and has glamour muscles. He also has none of the original scarring or any of the PTSD issues that Biehn's version had, and Michael Biehn is also a much better actor. I was not convinced that Courtney was Kyle Reese.And now for the worst part: like the title says, it was exactly as bad as I thought it would be. If it had been worse, it would have been enjoyably bad. If it had been better, well, that speaks for itself. But this was exactly as bad. There was a couple of funny lines here and there, and Arnold was alright in this movie, but the obvious CGI was shameful and I found myself angry that this movie was exactly what I thought it would be. The first three movies were all rated R and went all the way. This was PG-13, and clearly not fully realized. I'm glad I watched it online for free instead of paying for a movie ticket or buying the Blu-Ray.",Terminator Genisys

1085,maskerader,way better than expected,9,15 April 2016,"I really can't understand all the hate. Yesterday I've watched Terminator: Salvation and it turned out to be boring and lame, so I've waited Terminator: Genisys to be the same kind.I'm glad I was wrong. The movie appeared to be just very well made. Plot with twists I liked to follow, action that is understandable yet sci-fi-styled and of just right amount, very respectful usage of T1/T2 material, nice cast of actors (though I'd prefer another Reese - Emilia and Arnie were great), all seasoned with a humour.Reminded me of Men in Black 3 - that was also much better than I thought it would be.",Terminator Genisys
1086,deeobat,Hmm...,1,3 July 2017,"I'm sure I'm not adding anything new to the discussion here, but having only just seen this film, I signed up to IMDb because just I have to say something about it. I love the first two films so much, thought part 3 was an abomination, and Salvation had some good bits, so I guess I was a little apprehensive about watching this one. I have never seen a film that so spectacularly manages to both simultaneously celebrate and p*ss all over the original 2 films' legacy. I thought it was absolute garbage and nearly turned it off up until the point when we revisit 1984, then started enjoying it for a bit, then the minute that we discover that what appears to be John Connor is actually a Terminator it all went to sh*t again. And to be dragged out for 2 hours! Please, don't make any more sequels. Apparently the rights return to James Cameron in 2019 and I guess he is the only person who can be trusted to make a decent sequel, although I understand he approved of this one and thought it should be considered the 3rd film in the series, so well never mind then. Let's not taint the original two any more, please. This one certainly does, and then some.",Terminator Genisys
1087,bennettc-3,Great movie - see it in 3D,9,6 July 2015,"I've been surprised by some of the critic reviews not praising this film. If you're into Terminator movies this movie is for you. Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect in this role and provides some welcomed humour amongst the continuous action, which is excellent by the way. Other new comers to the series are well cast. Jason Clarke gives a good performance as John Connor, Emilia Clarke plays a saner Sarah Connor and looks good too, and Jai Courtney is brilliant as Kyle Reese. There's some interesting interpretation of the story so far and some clever plot adjustments to keep it interesting and up to date. The special effects and action scenes are really really good and I saw it in 3D which I'd highly recommend. Overall the film exceeded my expectations and I would recommend it to Terminator fans or newbies to the genre.",Terminator Genisys
1088,DetectiveDee,Misguided nostalgia ride that chases its own tail,4,21 July 2015,"Remember when ""Terminator"" was something special? Congrats, you must be over 30 years old. ""Terminator 3"" (2003) has already been a major disappointment and the sequel ""Salvation"" (2009), while at least trying something new, was incredibly lifeless. ""Genisys"" picks up the nostalgic approach of ""T3"" again and turns soon into a parade of references to the seminal first two movies. But while in those the element of time travel was just a storytelling twist that set up the main plot, the latest sequel makes the mistake to turn it into the major propellant of the happenings on screen, so expect a lot of blah blah about alternate time lines, ""Nexus points"" (there is an exposition about this nonsense, yawn) and whatnot, but it's just a ploy to cobble together variation of scenes we already know from the preceding films. Worst of all is the fact though that the film seems to feel very smart about this approach, yet there is no inherent logic to all the time travel stuff and the writers even had the balls to state that a lot of it will be explained in the sequel- which I hope never realizes. The acting is mostly rather bad. I have never seen ""Game of Thrones"", but Emilia Clarke did not impress me here with her shrill interpretation of Sarah Connor. Jai Courtney is wooden as always and B-movie face Jason Clarke must be the least intimidating Terminator on screen so far. Arnold seems a little lost and his role is reduced to that of Mr. Exposition and Dad Surrogate. The action is not very impressive either, it misses the inventiveness and precision of Cameron's direction. Some of the physics are just ludicrous, even for an action movie. Bad CGI reinforces the feeling that nothing is at stake, a feeling that is already established by the fact that the time travel shenanigans opened the door for all kinds of randomness.",Terminator Genisys
