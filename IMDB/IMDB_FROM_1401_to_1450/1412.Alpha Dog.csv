0,SnoopyStyle,need more gritty action,7,20 September 2013,"It's 1999 in Claremont, California. Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch) is a drug dealer and son of a underworld figure Sonny (Bruce Willis). Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster) owes Johnny money, and Johnny decide to kidnap Jake's younger brother Zach (Anton Yelchin). It's just fun and games. Everybody treats this as nothing more than a crime in name only. Johnny's friend Frankie Ballenbacher (Justin Timberlake) keeps Zach captive, and starts partying with him. But in the end, he's still in danger.This is Nick Cassavetes film based on a real life crime story. It's a good movie. It had the indictment of youth culture, a shocking real story, and some of the hottest of stars. But having Justin Timberlake is way too distracting. It just scream gimmick. His star power overshadows his character. He needs to have more subtlety with his acting if he's to be the lead. Nick really needs a seasoned dramatic young actor in the role.",Alpha Dog
1,claudio_carvalho,A Sordid Crime (04 September 2007),7,22 March 2008,"In 1999, in Claremont, California, the violent Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster) owes US$ 1,200.00 to the coward drug dealer Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch), who is son of the powerful criminal Sonny Truelove (Bruce Willis). They fight and start a personal war, with Jake breaking into the house of Johnny with his friends, stealing the TV and leaving excrement in the living room. Johnny kidnaps Jake's fifteen year old brother Zach Mazurka (Anton Yelchin), who has just had an argument with his parents, and brings him to the upper class house of his friend Frankie Ballenbacher (Justin Timberlake). Along a couple of days, Zach meets the friends of Frankie, goes to parties, drinks boozes, smokes pot and has sex with other teenagers. When Johnny realizes that kidnapping means life sentence, he asks the minion scum Elvis Schmidt (Shawn Hatosy) to kill the boy.""Alpha Dog"" is an impressive movie, disclosing one of the most sordid crime I have ever seen in a film. I do not know how accurate the story is, but based on the screenplay it is amazing the level of alienation and cold blood of the criminals. I regret that the screenplay reveals the fate of Zach in the beginning, breaking the tension and a possible twist in the end. The performances are awesome, and I was very impressed with Ben Foster, Shawn Hatosy and Justin Timberlake, perfect in their roles. The great soundtrack begins with a beautiful interpretation of ""Over the Rainbow"", by Eva Cassidy, that gives a touch of class to this movie. Johnny (Jesse James) was actually arrested in Saquarema, Região dos Lagos, Brazil. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Alpha Dog""",Alpha Dog
2,kosmasp,"Good cast, good story ... good movie!",8,25 March 2007,"I watched the movie in a sneak preview. I didn't really know what I was in for. But I got pleasantly surprised ... I mean Justin Timberlake as an actor? I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who had/has prejudices about that. But he was really good. I saw Edison too, but he had Morgan Freeman and others by his side. I still can't say for sure if he acted in this one or if it's just an expansion of his personality (only time will tell . which means more movies with him), but I do think that he is good. Not De Niro/Pacino good, but good! :o) He is the first recognizable name of the young actors of course. You can't obviously forget about Sharon Stone (she's BTW in the one scene I don't like at all, because the scene is to long and it looks like Sharon made the director/editor lengthen that scene, just to show off ... her acting skills) and Bruce Willis. But besides them you also have Ben Foster, who some might know form his TV Work, others from his great job in the movie Hostage, but most will recognise as that Angel in X-Men 3! I could name the other young actors too, whom did all a great job in this movie, but you can also read their names on the IMDb list for the movie.I liked the movie, because it's an honest, dramatic and sometimes funny look at small time crime-rs.",Alpha Dog
3,rmax304823,Lower California.,6,12 April 2017,"Described as a docudrama, it's really a feature film that follows the time line of events pretty closely but perforce must introduce fictionalized dialog. That's okay. Nobody was taking notes and the dialog is convincing enough. The armature of the story is that some guy owes some other guy thirty large but he won't pay up, so the creditors kidnap the debtor's younger brother, take good care of him for a few days, and then, despite his swearing not to tell anyone about his so-called kidnapping, they shoot him full of holes in the desert in the mistaken belief that the fifteen-year-old hostage would squeal anyway and all the gang would get life imprisonment. It reminded me of ""Kids"" except that this was far more violent.It serves as an introduction to the anomic life of teen agers in the prettiest parts of Southern California -- Pomona, Montclair, Palm Springs. Their families are middle class but the kids themselves transcend social class. They form a logical set of their own. None seems to have a job. One muses about ""taking a course"" but it's clear that they have little interest in anything except the goings on of their own clique. They might find a graphic novel too challenging. Some of them wouldn't be able to find their home town on a map. They lack curiosity.What interests them the most is dope and money. Sex is readily available, with the beautiful girls (all with the same hair style) as eager as the boys, sometimes more eager. One girl applies all sorts of ministrations to her boy friend but he can't get it up. (And the girl is the unimpeachably beautiful Olivia Wilde.) The truly amazing thing is that ANY of the boys can get it up. They suck on bongs, smoke weed constantly, and drink hard liquor straight out of the bottle. No wonder some of them have a problem.It struck me that the parties ranged from ecstatic displays to bloody rage, with very little in between, a kind of binary party. But it's a little hard to reconcile this with the effects of marijuana or opiates with violence. Nevertheless, the violence is there and Ben Foster as one of the over-tattooed skin heads gets the palm for particularly intense role enactment. The guy is a human wrecking ball, trashing houses, decking three or four adversaries, and wearing white after Labor Day. Only one of these aimless guys shows any common sense but he's swept up in the plot anyway. They're all on the same hedonic treadmill.I wish that at least one of them would open a book or be seen watching something other than bad Westerns and cartoons. A mind is a terrible thing to waste, and so is a whole generation.",Alpha Dog
4,wes-connors,Boys in the 'Burb,5,27 December 2008,"Charismatic Emile Hirsch (as Johnny Truelove) is the coolest drug dealer in the valley; and, his hair is perfect. Tweaked user Ben Foster (as Jake Mazursky) owes Mr. Hirsch some hundred odd smackers; but, he can't pay the piper. So, Hirsch takes Mr. Foster's innocent 15-year-old brother Anton Yelchin (as Zack Mazursky) hostage. Mr. Yelchin bonds with tattooed sideman Justin Timberlake (as Frankie Ballenbacher). While his parents and bro' fret, young Yelchin parties it up with his abductor buds, and their babes. Soon, you and he will learn that not paying your dealer (not to mention emptying your bowels on his carpet) is serious business.Some Say the Idle Rich Are Decadent. Nick Cassavetes's ""Alpha Dog"" is worth seeing as a dramatic showcase for its cast. With a couple of exceptions, the cast do not seem sufficiently strung-out to be playing the doped-up drug crowd. Most everyone looks tightly toned - except Sharon Stone (as Olivia Mazursky); apparently, Ms. Stone's character was getting made-up to look fat, while the rest of the cast was working out. The cast do not look like their relationships and implied ages. Hirsch and Timberlake look like a ""little brother"" and ""big brother"", but their characters are not related.It Rhymes with Duck. Cassavetes's direction fits the story well, and the performances are individually adequate. But, the ensemble never coalesces - and, the script does not offer any deep understanding of the characters, or story. The only relationship that really works is the one between Mr. Timberlake and Mr. Yelchin; mostly, this is because the script gives the actors enough material to create something. Two of the film's most important cast members, Hirsch and right hand man Shawn Hatosy (as Elvis Schmidt) perform as well, but do not get enough to make the film very meaningful.***** Alpha Dog (2006) Nick Cassavetes ~ Emile Hirsch, Justin Timberlake, Shawn Hatosy",Alpha Dog
5,michaelRokeefe,The alpha male attracts chaos.,4,9 May 2007,"Nick Cassavetes directs this glorification of the true life story of one of the youngest people ever wanted by the FBI. Emile Hirsch plays drug dealer Johnny Truelove. He comes from a very well off family, owns his own home, several cars and numerous sycophants. Actually Johnny is idolized by his suburbanite posse. There is the dolt Elvis(Shawn Hatosy)and the burnt out Frankie(Justine Timberlake). Jake(Ben Foster)is a druggie that shorts him in a pot transaction. The speed freak Jake welches on the debt; so the powerful and privileged Johnny has Jake's 15-year-old brother Zack(Anton Yelchin)kidnapped and held as a marker. It becomes obvious the debt won't be paid any time soon. When Johnny and closer followers realize they're subject to doing long hard time behind bars for kidnapping; they consider the options: return Zack or off him.This film gives Timberlake the chance to strip his shirt off, show tattoos and partake of the drugs that comes with the territory. Plus his mouth couldn't be much fouler. All said, Justin probably does the best acting in this chaotic flick. Also in the cast are Bruce Willis, Sharon Stone, Dominique Swain, Laura Nativo, Regina Rice, Olivia Wilde and Harry Dean Stanton.",Alpha Dog
6,hitchcockthelegend,"You ever have that dream: the one where you did something... You don't know why, but you can never go back?",7,15 July 2019,"Alpha Dog is a filmic interpretation of the real life Jesse James Hollywood/Nicholas Markowitz case of 2000.We are in the company of young dope dealers, a group of wannabe gangsters who ultimately are way out of their depth, whose decisions are so moronically misguided they form the basis for what is the tragedy of this story. Directed by Nick Cassavetes, the pic has serious intentions but never quite gets to reach the greatest heights for dramatic verve purpose. Yet for all that, after being in the company of genuine lost boys and girls, watching them as 24 hour party people bluster for majority of the piece, it means that once the tragedy strikes the film has done its job. It becomes something to last in the memory, where Cassavetes' flashy techniques (split-screens - freeze frames etc) don't detract from the harsh reality of it all. There's a bunch of committed exuberant performances on show, with a roll call of then up and coming young actors to note. 7/10",Alpha Dog
7,CinemaSerf,A tale of toxic tedium..,5,30 March 2020,"I have to say that I was quite surprised by this. It is by no means great, but the story is a little more than just the vacuous Justin Timberlake showcase that I was expecting, The premiss is that of a group of bored youths who hang around together drinking, scoring and generally killing time. Emile Hirsch ""(Johnny"") is the top dog - his dad (Bruce Willis) is a big-wig dealer - who falls out with the total head case ""Jake"" (Ben Foster) who owes him a load of cash. By way of revenge they kidnap his younger brother and put him in the charge of a tattooed Timberlake (""Frankie""). Snag is, the brother doesn't really care and as he and ""Frankie"" spend more time together they begin to bond - shortly, the lad has become an integral part of their daily antics. At this point, the story takes a much darker turn and lost my engagement. The anger and expletive-ridden performances start to become more obnoxious; the characterisations devoid of any form of humanity and by the end I felt that, perhaps a testament to the acting skills of Ben Foster, we ought to just take a Gatling gun to the lot of them.",Alpha Dog
8,dbborroughs,not very interesting story of kids behaving badly,4,3 September 2007,"Based on a true story movie is less interesting than the controversy surrounding it- the murder case is due to go to trial at any moment and people are afraid the movie would taint the jury pool. The ads say based on the story of the youngest person on the FBI most wanted list. Truth is its a lot of young guns behaving badly in the story of a drug dealer who killed the brother of someone who owed him money in order to make a point. Twenty minutes in its clear that these are a bunch of not very bright people doing not very interesting bad things. If there had been no controversy it would have been straight to DVD, where we could have forgotten it even faster.",Alpha Dog
9,lastliberal,"Have you ever been laid, Stolen Boy?",7,2 September 2008,"The most telling moment of the film is when they were all together and making fun of the rappers with guns. You had no indication that guns were a big part of their lives, but they were there, just below the surface, and used when necessary.The movie moves on to a life of partying with the drug dealing below the surface until someone stepped over the line. Then things took a real twist when a crime of opportunity presented itself.You always hoped that things would turn out for the best. You were never really prepared for a dark conclusion. It just hit and hit hard.Justin Timberlake was outstanding and the person who really carried this movie. Anton Yelchin did a really great job as Zack. I certainly enjoyed Sharon Stone and was impressed with her part. Dominique Swain was great as Susan.My biggest complaint was the unrealistic lack of skin in situations that really called for it.

10,anaconda-40658,Omega Dog!,7,4 May 2015,"Alpha Dog (2006): Dir: Nick Cassevettes / Cast: Emile Hirsch, Shawn Hatosy, Justin Timberlake, Ben Foster, Anton Yelchin: Very depressing story of a drug deal gone wrong and the consequences upon the innocent. A kidnap victim sees his circumstance as a vacation due to the nature of his captures. Although well paced the solution may not be the most satisfactory. Director Nick Cassevettes shoots this like a live documentary, which may be the point since this is based on true events. Cassevettes previously made The Notebook as well as a despicable piece of junk called She's So Lovely. Emile Hirsch plays the drug leader responsible for the kidnapping due to a confrontation with someone else. His actions will have him on the run with possible death penalty consequences. Shawn Hatosy plays a gay player too willing to do Hirsch's bidding, and to aid a debt he agrees to perform a murder. Ben Foster plays victim's hot headed brother who threatens to kill the drug leader but all ends on a loss. Justin Timberlake is the surprise casting as one of the kidnappers whom forms a bond with the victim yet consequently must perform an unwilling task. Anton Yelchin plays the victim drawn in through deceit and sex that ultimately leads to depressing events. Very well made film but portraying kidnapping as fun and games may strike a bad cord that turns ugly fast. Score: 7 / 10",Alpha Dog
11,HotToastyRag,A well-crafted glorification,2,24 June 2019,"Alpha Dog is a movie that was so effective, it'll stay with me the rest of my life. When I rented it a couple of years ago, all I knew was that Justin Timberlake was in it and the promotional poster looked like it was about a bunch of rowdy teenagers. Some of you might already know what it's about, so you can imagine how shocked I was when the plot unfolded.Filmed as part-drama, part-mockumentary, it chronicles an extremely upsetting true story involving, well, rowdy teenagers. All the names were changed, so even though filmmaker Nick Cassavetes takes the movie extremely seriously, I didn't really know it was a true story until I learned more information online. Had I learned anything about this movie, or even watched the preview beforehand, I probably wouldn't have watched it. The only reason I didn't turn it off was because I didn't know it was a true story and didn't know how it was going to end. Nick Cassavetes mastered the art of suspense and created an extremely eerie feeling throughout the film so that even ridiculously ignorant audience members, such as myself, could sense something really bad might happen. The tension grows and the pace speeds up, mirroring the characters' thought processes as events spiral out of control and they feel they have no options, even though the audience can clearly see that they do. As upsetting as this was to watch, I can recognize that it was very well crafted.Emile Hirsch stars as the leader of his drug-using group of friends. He regularly deals them drugs and sometimes they get into debt paying him back. One indebted friend, Ben Foster, has a violent temper, and Emile comes up with a way to get Ben to pay him what he owes: kidnap his younger brother and hold him hostage. I won't tell you anymore of the plot, because chances are you remember this story. In case you don't know, you're better off not knowing and not watching the movie.Yes, the film itself is well-done, and yes, the acting is extremely good, but I still wish I'd never seen this movie. Interspersed throughout the movie are faux interviews with Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone, the parents of the involved children. Both give very realistic performances, and Sharon have a couple of scenes that are truly heartbreaking. Ben Foster is very frightening, and it's no wonder he's been typecast as a villain in later movies. Anton Yelchin, only seventeen years old, gives a particularly impressive performance as an innocent kid who has no idea what's about to happen. Balancing an innocent delivery is tricky, especially since the actor knows what's coming, and Anton's fresh without being obvious-quite a feat to master take after take in front of the camera.Bottom line: I don't really know why this movie was made. It's terrible enough that it happened in real life. Turning it into a motion picture, even though it's meant to be horrifying, is in a way a glorification. I wish it hadn't been glorified, and I wish I hadn't watched it. It took me over a month to shake off my heavy heart afterwards. To my fellow faint of heart, don't rent this movie. Check out the preview-which I've only just watched-and you probably won't even make it all the way through the three minutes. Please girls, don't make the same mistake I did by thinking it was a harmless Justin Timberlake movie.Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence and upsetting scenes involving children, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",Alpha Dog
12,movieman_kev,almost Omega Dog,4,3 May 2007,"Written and directed by Nick Cassavetes, this true life cautionary tale of Jessie James Hollywood (here renamed Johnny Truelove and played by Emile Hirsch of ""girl Next Door"" fame) and his infamous kidnapping and subsequent death of Nick Markowitz (redeemed Zack Mazursky and played by Anton Yelchin best known for ""Hearts in Atlantis), seems slickly made but is also deeply exploitative. Having made the movie this soon after the actual events, don't expect the film to have any significant closer to it. Asking the viewer to have even a little sympathy for the victimizers (this film is guilty of that on occasion) is not that palatable for me. The movie is not that well acted, except for Ben Foster as the kidnapped kid's bother and if you want to stretch the term 'good' just a bit, i might hesitantly include Timberlake who at slightly above average is still a lot better then i thought he would be. Kepp an eye out for the scene with Sharon Stone in the most laughably awful 'fat' make-up that I've ever seen. This is better then Cassavete's earlier John Q, but not by much and it's no less simple-minded.DVD Extras: Behind the scenes featurette; time-line of the witnesses; an ad for HD-DVD; and Trailers for ""Breach"", ""Children of Men"", ""Smokin' Aces"", ""Hot Fuzz"" & the remake of ""the Hitcher"" Eye Candy: Amber Heard, Amanda Seyfried, and Olivia Wilde all get topless; while Heather Wahlquist showcases her magnificent ass My Grade: D",Alpha Dog
13,gradyharp,"Despite the Horrifying Material, the Film is Well Made",8,5 May 2007,"ALPHA DOG is a tough movie to watch and to review. The story, in part because it is true, is repugnant, and the slice of life in 1999 in the San Gabriel Valley, California is disturbing to the point of nausea. But this heinous kidnap/murder of a 15-year-old kid by his peers is captured in an intense manner by writer/director Nick Cassavetes in the way he has cast, directed, and propelled this story of the infamous Jesse James Hollywood to the screen. It is tough to watch but it needed to be put in front of us to make us examine current parenting/adolescent dysfunction and the possible results.The story is so well known that summarizing it is most likely unnecessary. Cassavetes uses the superimposed documentary technique to validate the times and the characters involved in this crime ridden case. The true problem begins with severely dysfunctional parenting and extends into the drug and alcohol abusing, moneyed by crime, irreverent amoral teenagers driven by greed and lack of self discipline that results in the wasted death of a kid who happened to be the brother of one of the troubled, drug addled teenies: a 15-year-old was kidnapped and murdered for a bad drug debt of $1200.! The cast is strong and includes Emil Hirsch as Johnny (the Alpha Dog), Justin Timberlake, Shawn Hatosy, Fernando Vargas, and Vincent Kartheiser as Johnny's 'gang'; Ben Foster as the addicted debtor whose brother Anton Yelchin is killed; and Bruce Willis, Sharon Stone, David Thornton, and Harry Dean Stanton as some of the severely dysfunctional parents. They make a fine ensemble cast, especially the despicable characters they are asked to portray.The language is wholly gutter oriented and becomes tiresome - just like listening to it on our streets. Cassavetes ends his film with a survey of the consequences faced by each of the characters and that helps bring closure to an otherwise difficult bit of history to swallow. If only there were some hopeful solutions for changing this type of behavior given, but then that might have blunted in impact of the film. Grady Harp",Alpha Dog

15,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Alpha Dog,7,6 October 2007,"There will come a time where actors and actresses will decide to take on a role that will break the mold of their idoldom, and shed those cute, goody two shoes image for something that could demonstrate and add some depth to their credibility. So taking on more edgy, angst characters might just be their quick solution. Anne Hathaway lost her clothes and borrowed a foul mouth for her turn in Havoc, and Justin Timberlake here lost his coolness but almost always brought sexy back in his scenes, despite having tattoos riddling his toned body, and adopting as foul a mouth as Hathaway's Allison Lang.Nick Cassavetes' Alpha Dog, the closing film of Sundance 2006, tells of a true story, with a little mockumentary spin put on. Alpha Dog is like a Beverly Hills 90210 episode gone all wrong, where rich kids spend all their time in vice activities, including smoking weed (they even grow their own in their backyard), guzzling tonnes of alcohol, humping anything that moves, and peppering their vocabulary with expletives. I swear almost every sentence has the F-word in its numerous permutations, showcasing that it is indeed a word for any occasion.And it makes you wonder how much trouble these perpetually high bored kids get into so easily, without using their brains much and constantly shooting from their hips. For every action, there is reaction, and without considering the circumstances and outcome, personal pride, ego, or just blind faith, can bring about a chain of events with outcomes that are inevitable. Johnny Truelove (up and coming actor Emile Hirsh, who had starred in Lords of Dogtown, and the upcoming Speed Racer as Speed) and Jake Mazursky (Angel in X3) can't settle their feud over 800 bucks, and bad blood start to spill when boisterous dares under the influence of alcohol become tit for tat revenge. In a mindless spur of the moment retaliation, Jake's brother Zack (Anton Yelchin, he one who will be Chekov in the new Star Trek movie) gets bundled into a van, leaving everyone perplexed just what to do next.Timberlake, being an idol, gets to portray his character with pretty much being the best of the worst of them all. Being easy going and the man with the plan, he strikes up a brotherly friendship with Zack, which is possibly the number one rule of kidnapping, never to do. Getting chummy with your prey is always bad karma, and hinders hard decisions made. But for the most parts of the movie, this friendship takes centerstage. But that's not to say the rest of the cast were strolling in the park, as Hirsh was excellent in his role as the crazed, dazed and confused de facto leader Johnny Truelove, with his impulses usually getting the best (worse?) out of him. Looking pretty much like a bearded Leonardo DiCaprio in Blood Diamond and The Departed, there's a little Catch Me If YOu Can spin in the latter half of the story, with unexpected help from Dad (Bruce Willis, in yet another supporting role).There are a number of recognizable faces playing supporting roles here, like Sharon Stone and Dominique Swain (she has disappeared for a long time), but the narrative calls for nothing much from them. Perhaps one of the best scenes was a reminisce of the car ride in Seven, with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman driving Kevin Spacey, ad he rattles off his motives and rationale behind what he's doing. In the equivalent here, there was a tinge of sadness, and how it played out to the end will no doubt bring about some very mixed emotions, all rolled into one. If there's any moment from the movie that can justify putting a bum in the seat, this will be my justification.Those who can't survive listening to obscenities being rattled off with aplomb, or can't bear to witness their idol mouthing off, should steer clear of Alpha Dog. Otherwise, it offers, like Voice of a Murderer, a Crimewatch like narrative that recounts real events, and of course with certain dramatic license taken.",Alpha Dog
16,siderite,Kind of boring,7,3 June 2007,"This film has an interesting story to tell, but the delivery is pretty boring. I can't comment on the ending, either, as I would spoil it completely.Basically, it shows a community of spoiled rich kids, running drugs and acting tough and being really stupid. And there are consequences.Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone play secondary roles, also Harry Dean Stanton appears in the second movie with him I've seen tonight (what are the odds?), Justin Timberlake plays a major role, yet not a difficult one. I would say that the hardest and most demanding roles in the movie were played by Ben Foster and Anton Yelchin, and they did good.Bottom line: it's like a rich kid's version of gangster movies.",Alpha Dog
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,"I can't believe I'm saying this, it was actually good!",8,1 November 2007,"I wasn't at all interested in seeing Alpha Dog when it first came out, but my friend's brother had bought it when it was released onto DVD and he said that it was a great film and that Bruce Willis was in it, enough said, lol. I know it's ridicules, but I am such a Bruce Willis fan, so I rented this a couple days ago and watched it, I have to say that from what I was expecting, this turned out to be a pretty good film. It was a scary thing to watch since we have Justin Timberlake being introduced into the world of acting, but he was actually doing a good job, even though I laughed a few times since he's a white boy playing a ghetto guy. Still, he and the rest of the cast did a great job of this extremely sad story that led to the brutal murder of an innocent 15 year old teenager who had nothing to do with what their intentions were.Johnny Trulove is a notorious drug dealer in California who is loved by most since he seems to be such a good guy and takes good care of his customers. His closest customers are like family and come over all the time. But when an extremely sad and pathetic druggie comes over, Jake Mazursky demanding that he needs more drugs, but doesn't have the money, he and Johnny get into a huge fight. Jake comes back and breaks into Johnny's house and takes the TV and does some pretty sick things, then Johnny sees Jake's little brother walking down the street and kidnaps him. Now while his brother, Zack, is a hostage, he actually ends up partying with his boys and becomes one of them. But Johnny is so freaked out at what could happen when Zack's rich parents find out that he's thinking murder for the kid.Alpha Dog starts off as this dark drama with some comedy mixed in, but then takes a brutal turn that makes the movie into something extremely sad and disturbing. The only thing I wish they had made more clear to the teenagers and possible kids watching this movie was what horrible things that drugs could do besides just not think clearly. Because there were some moments where they made it look like drugs could be OK and fun to do every once in a while. But I can't change the movie, however, I do recommend this film, it was pretty good and definitely got the story through to you.8/10",Alpha Dog
18,Buddy-51,underrated morality tale taken from today's headlines,7,19 May 2007,"Although many of the actual names and locations have been changed for the movie, Nick Cassavetes' ""Alpha Dog"" tells the largely fact-based story of a particularly heinous homicide that took place in Southern California in the summer of 2000 (changed to the fall of 1999 for the film). The crime involved a group of young drug dealers who kidnapped, then eventually murdered, the 15-year-old brother of a fellow drug dealer who owed the ringleader money and who, largely out of stubbornness and pride, refused to pay up the debt. After the discovery of the body, most of the perpetrators were convicted and sent to prison, but the mastermind, Jesse James Hollywood (called Johnny Truelove in the movie), managed to flee to South America where, in 2005, he was eventually arrested and sent back to the States to face trial on the charge of murder-in-the-first-degree.""Alpha Dog"" provides a grim, depressing look at the dark underbelly of American society where amoral, disenfranchised and disaffected youth play life-and-death games with drugs and guns, often with tragic consequences. In the case of this story, what begins almost as a spontaneous lark suddenly turns into deadly serious business as events begin to spiral further and further out of control as the story races ever more rapidly to its pre-ordained and inexorably tragic conclusion. Cassavetes has written a tight script that captures the fast-paced, drug-soaked milieu in which these young people do their ""business."" Yet, even though a number of the boys display a callous disregard for life, there are others who see the wrongness of what they are doing but who, through fear or misplaced loyalty or simply a belief that things ""would never really go that far,"" fail to put the brakes on the whole sordid affair before it is too late. It is in that context that Truelove relinquishes his role as the main focal point of the film in favor of Frankie Ballenbacher, a cheerfully sardonic wise guy whose job it is to watch over the boy while Johnny figures out what next to do with him. As Frankie becomes more and more attached to the kid, it becomes harder and harder for him to comply with Johnny's ultimate order of liquidating him. Frankie, thus, becomes the emotional buy-in point for the audience, even more so than the kidnapped boy himself.There are fine performances by Emile Hirsch, Shawn Hatosy, Ben Foster (""Six Feet Under""), Bruce Willis, Harry Dean Stanton and Sharon Stone, among others, but it is Justin Timberlake, as the high-strung but basically goodhearted Frankie, who walks off with the film. In his every moment on screen, the charismatic Timberlake brings an intensity, shrewdness and liveliness to his performance that bodes well for his future career in movies.In his direction, Cassavetes generates a starkness of vision and moodiness of tone that are greatly enhanced by the brooding, darkly-lit camera-work of French cinematographer Robert Fraisse.The movie has a few weaknesses. The faux-interview scenes, which Cassavetes periodically interjects into the film, don't do much to enhance the storyline and succeed only in confusing the audience and interrupting the action. Moreover, the ending comes upon us much too abruptly, depriving us of a sense of completion and catharsis, particularly in regards to Frankie's apprehension and feelings of remorse over what he did, as well as the older brother's reaction to the discovery of his sibling's body. And there are sporadic rare moments, mainly in the early part of the film, where one gets the sense that the cast members are ""playacting"" rather than truly inhabiting their parts. But these impressions are few and very fleeting and, for the most part, the actors do an admirable job of conveying the down-and-dirty reality of the life they are portraying.""Alpha Dog"" turns the spotlight on a subset of society we may not want to admit is there but which nonetheless exerts a tremendous negative influence on all our lives. The film serves as an alarm signal and a wakeup call that we ignore at our own peril.",Alpha Dog
19,Robert_duder,Another Hip Hop gangsta' flick that actually stands out from the rest,8,10 July 2007,"There is no getting away from the current Hip Hop generation of rap, drugs, sex, and street talk and movies and video games have certainly followed the pattern. I don't think I realized that Alpha Dog was yet another entry into that world similar to Boys 'N The Hood, Bully, Havoc...and the likes. I can't honestly say I've seen one yet that has really impressed me, I find the entire culture kind of revolting and anti-intelligent and downright sickening because I know this drug culture exists and yet Alpha Dog hooked me in after the first half hour. The biggest difference between this film and others like it is this one has a very strong story written and directed by veteran actor, director, and writer Nick Cassavetes. He actually goes beyond the stereotypical world to create characters that we care about, are interested in and the story grips you and pulls you in because it's simple, straight forward and only has one main path unlike some that try to do the 'Crash' themed multiple stories intersecting (which I personally think is annoying and few can pull it off. Instead Alpha Dog shows you two guys, vying for each other's drug turf and money and a plan by the main character to get revenge that ends up in a needless murder rap.I have to start my cast reviews with the one performer who is the focus of so much conversation and controversy, the master of music himself Justin Timberlake. Timberlake pulls out the stops in his debut role as nice guy party animal Frankie Ballenbacher and does a terrific job. In my opinion he is one of the really stand out strong performers in this film. He adds an intensity and a realness to his performance and proved he can really act!! Playing the lead is Emile Hirsch as Johnny Truelove, leaving behind his usual 'good boy' persona from films such as Girl Next Door and The Emperor's Club. Hirsch is really very good and plays the role very well of a young teenager who builds this world of drugs and crime and barely survives and becomes the youngest person ever on the FBI Most Wanted List. He's believable, intense and just an overall punk which is exactly the way the role should be played. Shawn Hatosy is also very good as Johnny Truelove's lackey so to speak and eventually the murderer. His role is small but significant and he does a great job. The supporting cast all play their roles to the proper intensity, which is what is needed for this film...intensity...this very real urban street life that these kids are dealing with. The strong supporting actors include Fernando Vargas, Alex Solowitz, Olivia Wilde, Shera Danese, and Amanda Seyfried. Also not to be missed is the really stellar, amazing performance by Ben Foster as the edgy and unbalanced Jake Mazursky who spends more time going into fits of rage than any other character but does it with real style and shocking outbursts. Anton Yelchin is also noteworthy as the kidnapped little brother of Mazursky (and eventual victim) Zack. He doesn't quite pull off the performance of some of the others but he is still very good in a very intense film.Director and writer Nick Cassavetes did a great job and in some aspects I'm a little surprised because he doesn't have a lot of experience to his name and sadly I think Alpha Dog will not be appreciated for the really good film that it is. There is so many like it out there and yet this one stands out because, as stated earlier, it has a really good story that is watchable by almost anyone. The film is definitely adult with scores of teenage sex scenes (not explicit---some very minor nudity), teenage drug use and alcohol and A LOT of explicit language, almost too much but enough to set the tone and make it all seem the more real. Alpha Dog is very worthwhile film to see and I think a lot of the younger generation will flock to it but not get the main message out of it but instead see a bunch of 'cool' street kids getting in crap. Unfortunate for this movie but still see it and judge for yourself!! 8/10",Alpha Dog
20,paul2001sw-1,More harrowing than profound,5,2 May 2007,"The violence associated with drug-dealing gangs of young people is a sad fact of life of the American ghetto. But (perhaps due in part to the glamorisation of ""gangsta"" life by rap music) gang culture has also spread to alienated members of the American middle classes, and 'Alpha Dog' is the second film I have seen based on a true story of a murder committed by (relatively privileged) white gangs, the other being Larry Clark's 'Bully'. 'Bully' dealt primarily with alienation (with a minor role for a gang member as a weapons supplier); in 'Alpha Dog', the leading characters are all gang members and the sense of alienation that produced this outcome is more of a background theme. One thing that comes out of both films is what a singularly unappealing culture this is: Scorcese's 'Goodfellas' at least had a sense of style, in 'City of God' we could sympathise with the impoverished background of the favella-dwellers, but watching rich kids destroy their lives (and those of others) in an orgy of sex, drugs and violence is spectacularly unpleasant: for this reason, when 'Alpha Dog' ends by trying to add a note of emotion, it fails, because the central characters are too unsympathetic to care about. Also, while 'Bully' was not exactly fun to watch, it was consistently provoking, whereas 'Alpha Dog' in places lapses into cliché. There's also an odd mixture of styles, with occasional pseudo-documentary touches added for little apparent reason. This does not make 'Alpha Dog' an awful film; but it is more harrowing than profound.",Alpha Dog
21,MLDinTN,"too long, too hard to follow",3,9 December 2007,"I didn't care for this movie. First it was too long at 2 hours and there seemed to be too many characters. I couldn't keep up with who was who. Plus the language is too harsh and I felt unnecessary. This isn't Goodfellos. The movie is about some thug drug dealers. One guy owes some money to Johnny the leader. He doesn't have the money, so Johnny kidnaps his younger brother, and holds him hostage. However, it doesn't seem like the kid is too worried. He is not tied up or anything. He goes to parties with them, chats up girls. His mistake was agreeing to take a ride out to the middle of no where with Johnny and his gang.The acting was nothing special. It just didn't captivate my interest.FINAL VERDICT: I didn't like it, but I am sure others will. If you are a fan of any of the lead actors, then you might want to check it out.",Alpha Dog
22,g-bodyl,Difficult Film to Watch!,9,25 May 2012,"Alpha Dog is an emotional film that can be very difficult to watch. I was not able to take my eyes off this film even during the hardest scenes. I never knew that this film was based off true events. That fact made this movie even more difficult to watch. This film is not just about drugs and gangs, it has a deeper message to show.This film is based off true events. Johnny Truelove and his gang kidnaps the brother of a guy who owes them drug money.The acting is actually very good. This is one of the first films Justin Timberlake made after a long music career and he does the transition nicely. Emile Hirsch also played another big role as Truelove. But the true performance is by Anton Yelchin as the kidnapped brother. He gave the performance for the lifetime.Overall, this is a very powerful, well-made film. This movie also has a very unexpected but sad ending. This movie will stay with you for a long time. I rate this film 9/10.",Alpha Dog
23,kenjha,Dog Poop,4,4 July 2010,"Suppposedly based on real events, this film looks at a few days in the lives of a group of low-life California teens as they party, do drugs, have sex, fight, and spew profanities. In fact, there's hardly a line that does not contain profanity. It's meant to realistically depict street life, but all it shows is that the writer has no talent for writing dialog. In fact, Cassavetes, who wrote and directed, doesn't seem to have much talent for directing either. He randomly uses split screens, and about half way through the movie, starts sporadically flashing place, date and time on the screen. As there isn't a single likable character in this movie, it's hard to care what happens.",Alpha Dog
24,Floated2,Powerful real life depiction,8,12 August 2014,"Alpha Dog tells an impulsive, thoughtless act. Based on the true story of the Jesse James Hollywood story, Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch) and his cronies don't know what to do with their new charge: one moment they stuff him in the closet and duct tape his mouth, and the next, he and Truelove's de facto second-in-command Frankie (Justin Timberlake) are playing X-Box. Zack is unfazed — on one level, he's enjoying the adventure (in what must ultimately be Alpha Dog's saddest moment, he asserts that he sees it as ""just another story to tell his grandkids"") Anton Yelchin virtually runs away with the film. Director Nick Cassavetes throws Zack into an exaggerated, flamboyant universe, his brother Jake is unaware that he's taken hostage by a bunch of wannabe Tony Montanas. Yelchin is remarkable in the way he grounds Alpha Dog in reality. Certain scenes stand entirely alone. Zack's encounter with his parents on the stairs, the subtlety of their interaction, his fully believable and familiar frustration. There's nothing else like it in the movie. Late in the film, Yelchin is given a hugely difficult scene where Zack's fantasy abruptly becomes a nightmare, and he nails it, converting Zack's ordinariness from something faintly amusing to something powerful and terrifying. Justin Timberlake is also very impressive in this scene. This also works because of the extent to which Zack is the story's moral compass. For as long as he likes and trusts his new friends, the kidnapping really does seem like fun and games, and the tone of the film shifts along with his perceptions. From this perspective, his relationship with Frankie, while touching in its way, is the ultimate betrayal, and his desperate appeals to his ""friend"" in the scene I mentioned earlier are one part of Alpha Dog I can't seem to get out of my mind.The other half of the film, as you may have guessed, focuses on the misadventures of the kidnappers, and here Cassavetes runs into some problems. To his great credit, his screenplay takes some real stabs at complexity: though seeming every bit the amateur gangstas, Johnny Truelove and Co. openly mock a gangsta rap music video; despite the casual misogyny constantly bandied about, Truelove himself is portrayed early on, and somewhat bizarrely, as a staunch monogamist. Then there's the issue of the parents, who are either corrupt, debauched or clueless; Cassavetes seems to blame them for allowing this to happen, and that seems about right.In the end, though, it's not quite convincing. Truelove is simply vile, a coward and a liar. He's not allowed to function as a villain, and Emile Hirsch doesn't have much to work with. The film resists the inevitable conclusion that these guys are just losers, insisting on a view of their activities that's much more exotic than they merit, and at a certain point threatening to seem silly. Including a lot of coarse language and some frightening scenes of violence, Alpha Dog can give you a sense of disturbance once completed watching the film.",Alpha Dog
25,johnnyboyz,"Every Dog has its day, but going by this Cassavetes piece - not necessarily out of choice",8,21 June 2013,"I honestly didn't think any of this would ever work again after I had seen scattershot 2003 Canadian film ""11:14"", a film about young adults and their cars; partners; sex and shenanigans which was decent-'n'-everything, but in the wake of Pulp Fiction (and, to a lesser extent, Doug Liman's ""Go"") couldn't help but induce a reaction from any sane film-watcher that was along the lines of: Enough is enough. For the uninformed, the approach is to boil a series of strands and stories about a number of lowlifes down into a singular set urban zone and have them fall over one another during the ensuing hijinks, etc. that kick off as a result of a backfiring routine singular occurrence. The good news about Alpha Dog is that it works an absolute treat, a deeply distressing yet inherently moving film about people who amble into certain circles; quickly find their feet and then come into access the sorts of cars, houses and wealth that ought to be beyond them at this early stage in their lives.Where the likes of ""11:14"" was something like eight vignettes crammed into an 88 minute run time, and my criticisms were that if Pulp Fiction was by its own admission ""three stories...about one story"", and was an involving; burning drama which struck us as adult, why would you want to up the story quota and shorten the runtime in order to create something inferior and merely childish? To this extent, Alpha Dog's approach of covering two or so strands about several thugs falling out over loans, drugs and kidnaps told over two hours-plus is a welcome relief of taut drama and engaging genre frameworks. Crucially, 11:14 crammed its narrative(s) into its runtime – Alpha Dog more-so manoeuvres its narrative(s) into its runtime.The film unfolds in 1999 (almost a wry 'nod' to ""Go"", released in '99) and we're on the outskirts of Los Angeles, more specifically an affluent part of the state of California wherein the first generation of boys and girls in their early twenties have grown up as the kids of the gangsters and drug dealers who've come to possess these abodes in these neighbourhoods and are now old enough to have influence over these surroundings. Two of these people are a marijuana dealer and a neo-Nazi skinhead and the crux of the film revolves around a debt and consequent falling out between these two people. The dealer is a certain Johnny Truelove (Hirsch), a man whose introduction is very masculine in that he occupies a garage; possesses a number of weight machines and generally hangs out with a large group of other men who enjoy their swearing, etc. One boy, a smaller and younger kid named Elvis (Hatosy), is in debt to Johnny but we sense he doesn't mind so much as he gets to hang out with these guys. We sense that Johnny could most likely break Elvis in half at any moment should he so wish.Hence, the film's central burning conflict is thus allowed to carry with it a more agonised; more excruciating and more explosive dynamic when Johnny is placed up against the aforementioned Nazi figure, a man of Johnny's age and aggressive stature named Jake (Foster) who doesn't take any stick from anybody but who gets mixed up in proceedings on account of the fact he himself owes Johnny money. Persistent failure to pay up results in Zach (Yelchin), Jake's fifteen year old brother from one of his step-parents' other marriages, being taken from the side of a road one evening and held under ransom until the debt is paid. Jake makes for an interesting entity, someone who seems to enjoy getting Zach into trouble at home but is remorselessly violent in his attempts to find his brother when he goes missing and answers do not arise; he seems restrained and almost vulnerable, but at once evil and even psychopathic. The actor, Ben Foster, does a remarkable job in darting back and forth and really being able to depict all of sadism and desperation tinged with a hint of sadness.I don't think, like British film Kidulthood from the same year in its dealing with youths out of control across numerous strands, there will be those who will embrace the film as much as I did. It will not be for all, whereas the idea that it strikes us a somewhat watered down version of Larry Clark's ""Bully"" from several years earlier, I think misses the point. While equally strong-a piece, I took to Alpha Dog more out of its attention to narrative and its indelible attitude to depict the victim at the centre of its story, a teenager who suddenly finds himself in a web of sex; nauseating affluence and thuggish machismo whose own tale of being a prisoner sees this young creature teeter on swaying either into the drug-swamped mire or carrying on as he was before. He is at once his own character entity while systematically acting as a supporting act to what is essentially a gang war that kicks off because of him on the outside. In tune to ""Bully"", this is a humid-locale set tale of young adults living off a diet of drugs and hedonism as their parents watch on from the touchlines, suspicious but not strong enough to act. In spite of the tightly woven story and good eye for dramatic crime scenarios, it wouldn't be so tragic if practically every frame of it wasn't what really happened to several juveniles some years ago.",Alpha Dog
26,damianphelps,Should Have A Higher Profile,8,17 April 2021,"This is a stunner!Super passionate movie with panic pumping through the veins of almost all the characters (amusingly not the kidnaped).

27,Vartiainen,Gets better towards the end,2,10 January 2012,"Initially, I wasn't impressed with this film. There was a bunch of young drug dealers, trying to be overly rad and slick, with Bruce Willis giving a very tired performance and with unlikable main characters. But, as the main story started to unfold and we truly got to know these characters, I was actually pulled into their world, their point of view, their personal ideas and personalities. It wasn't a pleasant world and not one I'd want to live in, but I got to understand it a little bit better. In addition, this movie understands that in order for us to sympathize with a character, we first have to understand that character. We have to see where he's coming from, what has happened to him before the actual conflict that has put him under duress. We may not agree with the character despite all that, but we will at least understand his perspective, his point of view. The world of young, idiotic and foolhardy drug dealers is explored in great deal in this film, with some excellent role performances from Emile Hirsch, Justin Timberlake and, most of all, from Anton Yelchin, who really made us feel for the character of Zack. All in all it's not a bad film. The beginning is kind of off-putting, but as the stakes start to get higher with time passing, so does the quality of the film rise. And by the time of the third act, I found myself immersed into this film.",Alpha Dog
28,Chris Knipp,Real bad behavior in the Valley,8,16 January 2007,"Nick Cassavetes has assembled quite an aggregate of budding star power for this true crime film -- forgive me if I don't get all their names -- which is surprisingly interesting for something ""dumped"" onto US screens in early January. Unfortunately Justin Timberlake is getting more press than the established young actor Emile Hersh, whose character is the more central figure of this true crime story of dissolute, hedonistic middle class youths in the Valley too dumb to know kidnapping is a capital offense and murder is worse. We also get an older generation, helpless or immoral parents, ""second and third generation sleazeballs"" who attempt saves and damage control in vain. These include not only Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone but ageless cult favorite Harry Dean Stanton. Surprisingly it's said Cassavetes had access to court records, even though Hersh's character has not gone to trial (this was what caused delays and explains the odd release time).There are different ways of looking at Alpha Dog: mindless thrills, tsk-tsk material, another to dump on the youth flick trash heap; or you can see it as Nick Cassavetes finding his way out from under the shadow of his father. Earlier efforts were lackluster: 1996's Unhook the Stars with parental muse Gina Rowlands; 1997's She's So Lovely, rehashing a script by his father. A detour into slick schlock was 2002's Denzel Washington vehicle John Q, and then he did the weepy 2004 The Notebook, not exactly a challenging role for Half Nelson's supposedly ""edgy"" but in fact quite uneven Ryan Gosling. Alpha Dog is something different, a pseudo-vérité crime tale that requires little mood-setting or background. The actors provide that, along with lots of vile colloquial-inflected action. In a time when the word ""ensemble"" is being thrown around loosely, this really has it with its breathless gangsta-rap-video fueled partying, manic family fights, and drugged-out violence, all involving family and competing buddies, ""dawgs,"" druggily seeking Alpha-hood, rather than real hoods or Mafiosi.Hersh is Johnny Truelove, based on FBI most-wanted criminal Jesse James Hollywood, who was supplied with marijuana to sell by his father Sonny (Willis). Timberlake is his best pal, Frankie. Another pal, maybe more their ""bitch"" in the youths' charming lingo, is Elvis Schmidt (Shawn Hatosy). The wild card is Jake Mazursky (an over-the-top Ben Foster), a violent speed punk from a respectable Jewish family (Stone is the mom, David Thornton the ineffectual dad) with a sweet kewpie-doll younger brother named Zach (Anton Yelchin) who's dying to turn bad and escape his boring, cloying home. In part this is one of those short-happy-life tales where a 15-year-old boy gets all the drugs and girls he wants, gets laid for the first time, then meets a tragic end. This isn't the first story where a kid enjoys getting kidnapped and is blinded by drugs and the glamour and excitement of lawlessness from seeing he's in mortal danger. Be prepared for underdressed girls, testosterone overload, and a vile excess of F-words and drugs.The ending is terrifying and deeply sad. You go away with a sense of out-of-control action that seems utterly appropriate to the narrative. Where Larry Clark does this sort of thing better is in his focusing more exclusively on the.Kids. Clark did his own chronicle of a true crime in the absorbing and dispiriting 2001 Bully. The motives and the arc differ, but the stupidity level is very much the same. Since the essence of both chronicles is lack of parental control, Alpha Dog's jarring vérité interviews with parents seem irrelevant and, okay, Cassavetes has an elaborate cast of real parallel witnesses to introduce, but we don't need constant titles introducing them with numbers. Such devices only interrupt our perception of the lethal dynamic, but it's Cassavetes' intention that parents should have a voice, so however unnecessarily they get that in order to alternately pretend ignorance or say how devastated they are.There is something charismatic about Timberlake; or is it simply his supermarket-checkout-mag fame subconsciously pushing our buttons? He supplies mostly just a smile and a lot of bare-chested tattoos and, truth to tell, Hersh doesn't get much to do in his lunkhead role. You might almost expect him to say ""Duh."" Foster is intense with meth-head hysteria that he researched carefully, but his character is still overdrawn. Yelchin has the innocence and cheekbones to be a tragic victim and bubblegum idol who's catnip to the girl groupies. But singling out leads is misleading because there are several dozen characters here and the movie's accomplishment is that they all come alive pretty well. What happens is that Johnnie is angry because Jake owes him $1200. He and his buds run across younger brother Zach, they grab him as ""hostage"" to press Jake to pay; the rest follows.This seems to rate higher with the critics than Clark's Bully did, but newspaper reviewers are reluctant to praise anything so ""irresponsible"" and yet ""watchable"": they might look duped. Timberlake does an okay job; he's relaxed and natural on screen. Maybe Nick Cassavetes deserves the credit for some of that, and for the naturalistic improvised feel the interactions have. This is his best film to date, and the one most worthy of a younger version of his father. While we're trashing Alpha Dog, we might remember what a lot of young actors male and female get a chance to do convincing and promising work in it; and while we're regretting its ""lack of narrative structure"" (a criticism leveled at Bully as well) we might consider the real-life lack of a plan whenever dumb improvisatory criminals go to work: this is a tragi-comedy of errors of warped Shakespearean dimensions. It's not clear what's ""irresponsible"" about a movie that ends by reporting, as Bully also did, that the perpetrators all got caught (but Johnnie Truelove only after five years of successful flight) and punished (the latter, as mentioned, still awaiting trial for the 2000 crime).",Alpha Dog
29,BeneCumb,Not so thrilling - but with some excellent performances,7,6 October 2012,"Based on real events, this movie is somewhat hectic, too much attention is paid on orgiastic parties driven by drugs and alcohol. The scenes prior to the tragic event are rather superficial. As for the cast, Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone are fine as usual (though their parts are rather small), but the real surprises to me were Ben Foster, Anton Yeltchin and Justin Timberlake, especially the latter, who is mostly soft and ""dilatory"" in his music, but gave a remarkably tough performance in the movie. Female characters did not differ much to me - most of them were just used and sometimes abused by those young males, who often called them bitches. However, it is strange that, in the U.S., for such a conduct (I mean this pseudo-kidnapping where the ""victim"" could freely move, party and had no hard feelings towards the involved) it is possible to get life sentence! But potential harsh penalty can provoke desperate measures...I assume the movie is meant to be a warning for hedonistic youngsters and as a hint that ""all criminals get caught"", but it is still watchable - but not a family movie.",Alpha Dog

31,meeza,Doggoned Good!,8,7 June 2008,"Yo, Dog! I am going to create my film review of Director Nick Cassavetes' youth crime flick ""Alpha Dog"" in alphabetical order. A is for ""Awesome"" ensemble acting from Emile Hirsch, Justin Timberlake, Shawn Hatosy, Ben Foster, Harry Dean Stanton, Bruce Willis, and Sharon Stone. Hirsch plays the real-life juvenile delinquent Jesse James Hollywood (his character name here is Johnny Truelove) who mastered the kidnapping and ordered the fatal hit on a younger stepbrother of a drug addict customer who owed him money. Truelove was truly in love with the juvie negligent life of sex, drugs, guns, and chaos. He was in ""America's Most Wanted"" list for several years until his capture a couple of years ago in Brazil. Hirsch's captivating acting continues to increase his acting stock in ""America's Most Wanted Actors"" list from the film industry. Timberlake also brought his surprising strong acting back here as the contrived Truelove right-hand juvenile delinquent man Frankie. Timberlake's Frankie is portrayed as a warm-hearted but unrighteous youth who is a follower and not a leader or in his case this Frankie Always Goes To Hollywood, Hollywood Jesse James that is. Shawn Hatosy is king here as Elvis, the Truelove brownnoser who craves to prove his criminal self to Johnny The Leader, so much so that Elvis is the one that ends up committing the murder on the young stepbrother Zach Mazursky. Ben Foster plays older stepbrother Jake Mazursky, the aforementioned drug addict nemesis of Truelove. Foster fosters another powerful psychotic acting performance here as he did in ""3:10 To Yuma"". Bruce Willis was a bad daddy-o in a good acting way as Truelove's dad Sonny and Harry Dean Stanton was cosmic as the geriatric loudmouth Cosmo. I must state though that the most solid performance of ""Alpha Dog"" is barked out from Sharon Stone as Olivia Mazursky, the grieving mom of Zach. Stone reaches the apex of her acting career in two emotionally driven scenes which brought more from her than her usual basic acting instinct. Back to the Alphabet! B is for ""Ballicious"" (Ok, not a word). But I must state that it did take some major testicular action for Director Nick Cassavetes to orchestrate this gutsy real- life drama on screen with adequate precision. C is for ""Cliché"" because even though Cassavetes did get A's from me for his direction, his formulaic screenplay could have used more of a witty alphabetical dialogue. Of course, I am not going to go through the entire alphabet on my viewpoints of ""Alpha Dog"". However, I do think that through my aforementioned analysis of ""Alpha Dog"" it spells out a recommended viewing of this gripping film. **** Good",Alpha Dog
32,Chris_Docker,Moralising from a position of weakness?,6,12 April 2007,"Have you ever done something really stupid? Just on the spur of the moment? We all have. Maybe, right now, remember one time if you can. How did that feel? What if, instead of quickly admitting your mistake, you paint yourself further into a corner? Imagine backing down would be too embarrassing! Peer pressure prevents you from being 'wrong'. You have to defend your position . . .Alpha Dog, Johnny Truelove, is based on real life character, Jesse James Hollywood. We are given to assume Hollywood did just that, because the prosecuting attorney gave these filmmakers his files. Only one catch - it was before Jesse went to trial.But don't let the background turn you off the film yet. Let's examine it from a purely cinematic point of view. There's great acting, great editing and great direction.Johnny is a white, Californian, middle-class kid who does a lot of hash (which he buys from his respectable dad, Bruce Willis). He also sells large amounts and doesn't worry about getting caught.His acquaintance Jake (Ben Foster) is a crystal meth addict. Jake and brother Zack are from a more conservative white, middle-class family. Their mother (Sharon Stone) is a bit overbearing. When their parents find Zack using hash to relax, they give him a hard time.Although Johnny is living in a modern-day hippie paradise, things get ugly when Jake can't pay him money he owes and turns violent. Jake then goes to Johnny's luxury apartment, smashes it up, and defecates on the carpet. Johnny is watching from the dark, but tells his friends he was 'out at the time'. On impulse, Johnny and his pals kidnap Zach.Zach is quite happy to be kidnapped. He gets to smoke lots of hash, lose his virginity, and hang out with many 'cool dudes'. Realising too late the kidnap could land them in hot water, Johnny starts to panic and make rash decisions.Alpha Dog could be an unremarkable and formulaic film but is enlivened by strong performances. Sharon Stone (who at one point is unrecognisable for several minutes), Harry Dean Stanton, and Bruce Willis all provide background strength and stability that allows the younger actors to shine. Justin Timberlake, as Johnny's emotionally torn friend Frankie, demonstrates skills well beyond singing and songwriting in a very nuanced and conflicted role. Ben Foster's character is unnervingly realistic. The ensemble works well, gelling convincingly. Each is interesting. Each is authentic. A tight script and firm director's hand keep our attention without resorting to manic pacing. A tastefully selected soundtrack, from Eva Cassidy's evocative rendering of 'Over the Rainbow' to Bowie's haunting 'Wild Is The Wind' adds to the overall stylishness. But it is the motivations that seem so repugnant, as if the filmmakers had, in a way, boxed themselves into a stupidity almost as bad as their characters.We started with the moral morass of shamelessly portraying real life sub judice proceedings in a feature film (court interventions ensured the filmmakers changed names). On top of that is the questionable way drugs are portrayed. The hash-users, apart from being layabouts, seem to do themselves and others no harm. Unpaid debts, from a meth addict and burglar, draw them into a violent course of events that would not have occurred were the sale of hash lawful and regulated. Alpha Dog fails to differentiate and promotes a very questionable 'all drugs are evil' message. It tries to say that children take drugs because of parental alienation. Director Nick Cassavetes claims, as does an intro that moves from grainy, sentimental images of childhood to an interview with Johnny's dad, that the issue is not one of drugs but of parenting.

33,mattkratz,OK at best,7,6 November 2016,"This is a crime/drug movie. It has an outstanding cast (Bruce Willis, Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, Emile Hirsch, Sharon Stone, the late Anton Yelchin, etc.), but it wasn't quite an outstanding movie. It experiments with techniques like split screen, documentary style, and other styles, but doesn't stick with them long enough, and those work to a certain degree. The movie was a bit unpleasant and featured a gratuitous amount of violence and language (as can be expected for a movie like this), and a story was somewhat present if a little difficult to follow. My favorite scene was the Marco Polo scene in the pool. The cast did try hard and work fairly well together, but the end result wasn't really a classic.** out of ****",Alpha Dog

HE WILL BE A MAJOR PLAYER SOON, Shawn Hatosy (another fine role for this fine actor), Ben Foster,(he cant give a bad performance if he tried) & Justin Timberlake (forget what else you may have heard about him HE CAN ACT), In fact all the younger performers do fine jobs.The older members of the cast are headed by Bruce Willis as one of the fathers, & Sharon Stone as the mother of the dead lad,(she has a scene at the end of the movie that is remarkable--& yes that is her in the fat suit, Also in appearing is one of our best character actors, Harry Dean Stanton (he excels as usual)The production is first rate, There is a pulse pounding music score that fits the mood & tone of this tragedy.If there was not so much cursing I may have given this a higher rating, BUT with at least 300 uses of the F type words I cannot. so my rating is*** (out of 4) 88 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10) .",Alpha Dog
37,Jonny_Numb,If Larry Clark pulled his punches...,7,4 January 2008,"The last act of ""Alpha Dog"" ends on a particularly harrowing, effective note--granted, it's marred by some bad CGI and green-screening, but the almost unbearable emotional build-up is something quite uncommon for a mainstream flick of this type. Up until the last act, ""Alpha Dog"" plays out like a close cousin to Larry Clark's similarly-themed (but much better) ""Bully,"" the story of some bored, spoiled-rotten California teens who decide to murder one of their own, with little regard for the consequences. Unfortunately, writer-director Nick Cassavetes (son of John) tacks on SECOND last act that becomes self-indulgent (with postscript 'interview' segments) and actually defuses some of the impact; ""Alpha Dog"" would have packed a stronger gut-punch had it not gone so pretentiously (and safely) ""Hollywood."" In this film, the teens/twentysomethings are similarly infatuated with gangsta rap, drugs, sex, and nihilism--and the adults aren't much better. Cassavetes has enlisted a cast of up-and-comers, some of which (the always-intense Ben Foster and, surprisingly, Justin Timberlake) are better than others (Emile Hirsch is still a bit bland), and all of which convincingly immerse themselves in a decadent, consequence-free lifestyle: when Jake Mazursky (Foster) burns Johnny Truelove (Hirsch) on a big drug deal, Truelove and his cohorts kidnap their rival's young brother, Zack (Anton Yelchin), a naive waif whom they immerse in their luxury lifestyle, with little realization of the situation he's in (Yelchin's Zack is so likable and convincing that his fate is genuinely gut-wrenching). For about 3/4 of ""Alpha Dog,"" Cassavetes treads a fine line between art and exploitation (and titillation) that ultimately comes undone when he decides to cover his tail with the heavy-handed epilogue; unlike Clark, who gives his characters a full-cavity search (both figuratively and literally) that leaves no flaw uncovered and makes no excuse for heinously amoral actions, Cassavetes (or perhaps the producers) seems scared of where such paths will lead if not kept in check. That's too bad--""Alpha Dog"" has a lot going for it, and what is here is certainly worth a look, but its final 20 minutes leave something (or nothing?) to be desired.6.5 out of 10",Alpha Dog
38,AudioFileZ,Depravity Of Drug Adled Youth As They Descend Into Hell,7,4 December 2007,"This true story is such a tragedy that several of Cassevettes missteps stand out, yet ultimately you'll be too invested in finding out the outcome to do anything but watch it to it's conclusion. And what a horrific conclusion it is.I think this is a wake up call as to what can happen to anyone, particularly young people, when there are no values instilled early their development, yet ample money enables laziness and indulgence. If idleness is the devil's workshop then idleness with lots of drugs, alcohol, illicit sex, and money fuels that workshop to produce people capable of evil as this film so aptly depicts. This, then is a cautionary tale as much as it is anything.In closing, I recommend this film with the caveat that it is at times quite raw as it realistically depicts the foul language, poor morality, and extremely unsettling lifestyle of the people depicted. It should be said that Justin Timberlake surprises in his role showing the innocence of youth tainted by pure thuggery. Anton Yelchin practically steals the show with his performance as the 15 year old victim. Finally, Emile Hirsch showed that he could be equally effective as a supporting actor.

44,jaredmobarak,"No more music videos, that's what I thinkAlpha Dog",7,14 January 2007,"Alpha Dog is based on the real life incident perpetrated by Jesse James Hollywood, (surprisingly his actual given name), and his band of 20-something friends getting over their heads when their drug business hits a snag. Hollywood had a debt owed by another young adult and when a riff begins between them, he took the debtor's brother hostage until the money was paid in full. Hollywood stands trial right now for the planning the murder of Nick Markowitz, a kid who was caught in the middle of a tragedy ripe for a filmed tribute. Alpha Dog isn't as much a tribute as it is a cautionary tale of how these are kids playing dress-up. They see gangsta culture and feel they can buy that lifestyle with their endless supply of money; they have no clue about the consequences of their actions, and no real remorse for the results. When this film is on, it is really on. Some scenes are so real and true to the culture and the mixed emotions going through the heads of kids that know nothing but being led in one direction by someone they think is their friend. Unfortunately, when the film is off, it is distracting and kills off the resonance left by the scenes that were on the money.Nick Cassavetes, (yes the guy who adapted and directed The Notebook), comes in with a film that shows how much work went into it. You can tell that he really researched the case and tried to keep every detail intact. His use of captions for day, location, and time lend to the documentary-like construction, and the numbering of witnesses shows how many opportunities were there to stop the event from escalating. Just seeing all these people watching what was going on and doing nothing about it really hits home that we live in a world where one feels the need to just mind their own business, washing themselves clean of anything that might happen as a result. Adults see the abduction, but do nothing so as to not risk harm to themselves, and kids just find the circumstances a joke that will go away in the end and should be enjoyed while it lasts. It really is a tragic story and Cassavetes does a good job in getting that point across. However, I had seen an interview with him that spoke of how the film was completed when Hollywood was finally captured in South America. That incident made him go back to the film, recut it, and add footage to portray it. These additions are what ruin the film from being great. The final twenty minutes or so show fake interview footage and clips of those involved being captured. Every minute of it is unnecessary and instead of putting closure to the film, just totally destroys the climax that occurred right before. The movie ends up being disjointed and rough, as though it needed to be put together quickly and never allowed to be honed to perfection. It is a shame too, as the climatic scene is emotionally draining and hard to watch. The actors are phenomenal and rather than leave those images burned to your mind, it is all washed clean by stilted footage without any utility to the story that was being told. A movie should be all encompassing viscerally and emotionally and not made into an episode of America's Most Wanted at the end.To elaborate a bit on the acting, this cast is stacked to the brim with quality people. Emile Hirsch is great, Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone do their job nicely, and it's good to see Shawn Hatosy with a significant role, (he's really good in Outside Providence), and Harry Dean Stanton back in front of the camera. The real standouts, though, are Anton Yelchin, Ben Foster, and Justin Timberlake. Yelchin plays the role of the stolen boy to perfection, full of innocence and a joy in being treated as one of the guys and hanging out with beautiful girls. Foster is just amazing as the junkie brother who's loose canon mentality spins the whole ordeal out of control to the point where Johnny Truelove, (Hirsch's Jesse James Hollywood character), can't decide what to do because he knows he'll have to watch his back whether the hostage lives or dies. The crazy coked out tweaking lends realism to the performance, as well as a comic undertone. Sure he may play it a bit over the top, but it is effective nonetheless. Finally, not to sound like every other review of the film, it must be said that Timberlake steals the show. The range he shows is exceptional for someone unaccustomed to acting on a normal basis. He is natural throughout and you can't help but feel helpless while watching him, Yelchin, and Chris Marquette in the pivotal scene towards the end.Now while I attribute most of the misfires here to the director, I must give him credit for its successes. The story arc is well laid out and especially effective in displaying some very humorous moments and comic setups for the first half of the film. By giving the audience a joyful entry into the darkness forthcoming, Cassavetes helps us sink into the proceedings and get caught up in the chaos. I also really like what he did with the opening credit sequence by having all his stars bring in old home movies. These aren't just made-up clips of random children, but the innocence of all our characters before society has corrupted them. I picked out Yelchin, Foster, and Hatosy at first viewing, and I'm sure would see that the rest were there as well. Alpha Dog is definitely worth a look, but unfortunately not the masterpiece it seems it could have been.PS. What were Alan Thicke and Janet Jones-Gretzky doing in this film for the three seconds each of screen time?",Alpha Dog
45,hall895,Amateurish effort,4,2 March 2011,"Alpha Dog tells the story of a group of young, suburban gangsters. They think they're big, bad tough guys. They're not. They're just stupid little punks. Emphasis on ""stupid"". One fine day the leader of this group of morons decides, on the spur of the moment, to kidnap somebody. These idiots probably couldn't pull off shoplifting a pack of gum so it is safe to say that kidnapping proves well beyond their criminal capabilities. Things spiral out of control. None of the morons knows what to do so they just run around saying bleep this, bleep that, bleep everything. If you take out all uses of a certain four-letter word which starts with ""f"" and ends with ""k"" this would essentially be a silent movie. What we have here is a bunch of moronic degenerate lowlifes in a rather moronic movie.The characters are completely distasteful but that doesn't necessarily doom the movie to failure. Amateurish acting, directing, writing and photography...that's the combination which sinks the movie. Then when you add in the fact that you'll inevitably hate every significant character save one what you end up with is one terrible, depressing movie. The only actor to come out of this mess with any kind of credit is Anton Yelchin who plays the young kidnapping victim. He gives a believable, endearing performance. Others are not so fortunate. Emile Hirsch makes hardly any impression at all as the gang leader. Which is better than can be said for the actors playing the rest of the bad guys. They're all rather terrible. Shawn Hatosy is entirely unconvincing in his part. Ben Foster goes ridiculously over the top in playing a strung-out Jewish guy...with a swastika tattoo. Then there's Justin Timberlake. He actually has one scene near the end in which he's quite good. It's as if an acting coach suddenly turned up on the set that day. Other than that? Dear Lord is he bad. The girls in the movie...Olivia Wilde, Amanda Seyfried, Amber Heard, Dominique Swain...seem to be there for purely decorative purposes. You also get Sharon Stone, who at one point dons the most ridiculous looking fatsuit you've ever seen. And Bruce Willis is in the movie too. I have no idea why. Perhaps he lost a bar bet with the director. The movie is pretty much a failure all the way around. Terribly written, terribly acted, terribly paced...mind-numbingly boring at times. It's a sad story about one poor boy surrounded by a bunch of reprehensible losers. The saddest thing of all is that the movie is based on a true story. This actually happened. These miserably stupid, vile, disgusting people actually exist in this world. Makes you lose a little faith in humanity.",Alpha Dog
46,MrGKB,"An intriguing change of pace from the director of ""The Notebook""...",7,10 October 2008,"...""Alpha Dog"" succeeds mostly on the basis of some very good ensemble acting, informed direction by auteur Nick ""John Q"" Cassavetes, and excellent camera-work and editing by, respectively, Robert ""Hotel Rwanda"" Fraisse and Alan ""American History X"" Heim, both of whom worked on Cassavetes' romantic weepie, ""The Notebook."" Presented in a pseudo-documentary style, ""Alpha Dog"" riffs on the true story of a young drug dealer who foolishly orders the kidnapping of the 15-year-old brother of a confederate who owes him money. As is so often the case, the situation ends in tragedy; meanwhile, Cassavetes delineates the essential empty self-involvement and corruption of wigger culture, along with the indifferent and/or ineffective parenting that brought it into being in the first place. The young people in ""Alpha Dog"" are generally as repellent as those in Larry Clark's ""Kids,"" and with a few exceptions just as unlikeable, and so are their parents. At times it makes ""Alpha Dog"" very frustrating to watch; you just want to grab these idiots by the scruff of their tattooed necks and shake some sense into their tiny minds. The only characters, interestingly enough, that elicit any real audience sympathy are the kidnapped victim and his eventual murderers.As mentioned, the acting is quite good, especially from the young up-and-comers. Standouts include Anton ""Hearts in Atlantis"" Yelchin as the unwary hostage (I'll be looking forward to seeing his work in ""Star Trek"" as well as ""Terminator Salvation""), Ben ""30 Days of Night"" Foster as his tweaker brother, Shawn ""The Faculty"" Hatosy as the browbeaten trigger-man, and especially Justin ""Black Snake Moan"" Timberlake as the head punk's right-hand manchild who ends up far deeper in the s*** than he ever expected (his final scene with Yelchin is heartbreaking). Prettyboy Emile ""Lords of Dogtown"" Hirsch does what he can with the role of Johnny Truelove, the kingpin who sets this tragedy in motion, but he's still hard to buy as anyone other than a poser (although, perhaps, that was Cassavetes' point). Bruce Willis, Sharon Stone, and Harry Dean Stanton lend star power to the proceedings with mixed results (none have enough screen time to really register, and Stone's make-up in her last scene hinders the effectiveness of her portrayal), while several lesser luminaries like Lukas Haas and Dominique Swain chip in to take mostly inconsequential roles. Overall, very strong ensemble work and a nice addition to everyone's resumé.""Alpha Dog"" borders on mainstream Hollywood parody with its profanity-laced dialog, rampant homophobia, misogyny, and indiscriminate drug and alcohol use, but Cassavetes manages to keep a lid on his script's excesses by allowing his audience to come to its own conclusions. Those conclusions may be unremarkable (crime does not pay, you reap what you sow, etc.), but the ride through American middle class anomie and dissolution is still entertaining. Recommended, with the reminder that this dog hunt is strictly not for children.",Alpha Dog
47,cultfilmfan,Alpha Dog,10,20 January 2007,"Alpha Dog is inspired by actual events and is about a drug dealer named Johnny Truelove who is owed money by an acquaintance of his named Jake. Seeing as Jake is not paying up, Johnny and his gang of friends decide to kidnap Jake's younger brother Zack and hold him until Jake pays. At first Zack is getting along really well with the people who kidnapped him and basically they just party and have fun all the time and Zack is not concerned at all. When Zack's parents and Jake become suspicious of who abducted him Johnny makes a plan with his friends as to what to do and things take a turn for the worst. Alpha Dog has good direction, a good script and good performances by the entire cast. After I left Alpha Dog, I realized just how impressed I was with it. Director and writer Nick Cassavetes does a great job of writing these teenage characters and just showing how they live their day to day lives. There is a certain authentic touch he gives these characters that makes the film all the more real and believable. The performances he gets out of these actors is also really impressive because everyone in this film shines. Near the end of the film the suspense builds up and the tension is delivered well and after the movie I could really feel the power of this film and it really made an impact on me. This is a type of film that left an impact on me that only truly great and powerfully made and delivered films will do. A lot of the film is just these teenage characters hanging out, partying and getting into trouble, but because it felt so real and genuine it was fascinating to watch. The scenes leading up to the powerful conclusion are also well written and I liked how the film looked at times like a documentary and at other times like a regular docudrama. The seediness and gritty nature of these characters and how they live and interact with each other is really showcased very well here and I don't think a film about teenagers and their lives has had such an impact on me since Larry Clark's Kids and Bully. This film is very similar to those films in a lot of ways and at times even borrows in their technique. However seeing as how I loved Kids and Bully this wasn't a problem for me at all and it just added to my love and admiration for this film. For a truly powerful and captivating motion picture that is a genuine and realistic slice of life which really had an impact on me I highly recommend this film. This is also the first film I have seen of 2007 and if there are more films with this kind of style, power and energy this year then 2007 will be a great year for movies.",Alpha Dog
48,jpschapira,Cassavetes came close...,6,27 February 2007,"I told my dad he wouldn't enjoy this film; it basically has young kids screaming at each other and cursing all the time. That's not a nice thing for a parent to watch, that's not a nice thing for anyone to watch actually, but the thing is the characters are my age. The parties they organize are not a lot different from the ones I go to; sometimes everything stays in control but other times it gets out of our hands.When we first see a frame in ""Alpha Dog"" it's Bruce Willis sitting on a chair, being irreverent as only he can be, while he answers some questions about his son. This is when we realize that something happened and we're going to experience itThe camera welcomes us to the world of Johnny Truelove, played by Emile Hirsch as if he doesn't care about anything and as if he knows it all. He doesn't, but he bosses his friends around; mostly Elvis (Shawn Hatosy) who does everything Truelove asks him to do.The thing is Truelove has the drugs, so Truelove has the power. Everybody comes to ask him for more merchandise; he goes to his father (the Willis character). Everybody owes him cash; but Jake Mazursky owes him big time. Mazursky is portrayed perfectly by Ben Foster, another solid actor in a cast of young talents. Foster may not have worked as much as his peers, but he definitely made the right choices: he co-starred with Hirsch in ""The Mudge Boy"" (the chemistry is visible here); he surpassed himself with his comedic lead in ""Get over it"" and he amazed everyone with his turn in ""Mystic River"", among other things.We meet Jake entering his family house, where his father (David Thornton) lives with a new woman, Olivia (Sharon Stone) who gave birth to his brother, Zack (Anton Yelchin). It seems that Jake comes and goes as he pleases, grabs some food and asks his father for money, which is a problem for Olivia, who knows the boy is on drugs; his father also knows, but appears to be more understanding.Mazursky does not get the money, and what happens because of it consist in the development of the film; that unexpectedly starts putting titles on screen as: 'Day One', '9:15 a.m.'. From the beginning, Nick Cassavetes imposes his style to the picture. Taking a complete turn from ""The Notebook"", the writer/director chooses a camera with a small amount of light (the man Robert Fraisse), that doesn't let us see important things at times. Uncertain and personal, he divides the screen in two at the most surprising moments.His screenplay, inspired by true events, must have also had something of his own life. I'm not saying he was on drugs, but the way the characters talk is annoying, nevertheless true and accurate. But something fails in the story; maybe it's too long and it doesn't move on. It seems like an eternity and it looses focus. Anyway, Cassavetes' best achievement with ""Alpha Dog"" is unquestionably the direction of actors. An ensemble with A-list stars and independent greats; a big cast to handleA lot of young actors.""The O.C's"" Olivia Wilde, Chris Marquette (from ""The Girl Next Door""), Amanda Seyfried (from ""Mean Girls""), an unrecognizable Harry Dean Stanton, the inconstant but good Dominique Swain, and Justin Timberlake. As Truelove's right hand Frankie, Timberlake gets the best performance of the cast. Forget N'sync, forget his music, just watching constructing his character and making it a human being. It's hard to explain but the singer is really the only actor who gets some true emotion out of his lines.",Alpha Dog

50,Son_of_Mansfield,Good dog.,8,22 June 2007,"Somewhere, Larry Clark is weeping, because John Cassavetes made the movie he wanted to make. The movie comes out right at the beginning and states that it's about parenting, no matter how you look at it. It's just ironic that it's the father who helped his son become a drug dealer and always supported his illegal activity, except, you know, murder. Alpha Dog is a good picture of disaffected youth with a very good cast of young actors headed by Emile Hearsh as the cold blooded Johnny Truelove and and Anton Yelchin and Ben Foster as the naive brothers Mazursky. Strangely, the good cast has a bad effect. Cassavetes tries too give everyone their time and let their actor instincts run a little wild. There is one thing that you can't argue with, there are some great moments in this movie. When the too smart to be around those so stupid Frankie tries to let Zack walk away from everything, Yelchin's teary plea to Frankie heartbreaking realization that he is going to die, and, like it or not, Sharon Stone's mother on the edge. Her final scene is the perfect counterpoint to Willis' opening, both of them considered themselves good parents, one was, yet both of their children didn't make it.",Alpha Dog
51,oneloveall,You will be pleased if expectations are low,6,28 April 2007,"Intense, gritty, and realistic- for teens, the movie still manages to concoct the right balance of urban drama and entertaining production to offer more good then harm for the rest of us. In a strange approach, Nick Cassavetes frames this true story around some mock-up news report, offering commentary, post-event, by a few of the adults in this cast. It is the first in a series of distractions, one that even tries to unsuccessfully deal with parental issues, but will end up causing little damage to the overall proceedings. What first appears to be just another venture into the uncensored, Larry Clark-like underworld of youth debauchery, crime, violence, sex and drugs (which essentially it is, even if pulled off fairly well) turns into an involving but spottily frustrating crime story. Centering around the misconceived kidnapping stemming from a drug arrangement gone sour leaves plenty of hip ambiguity to be played out by our young cast, an element that may either make or break one's enjoyment of Alpha Dog.Meeting, though certainly not surpassing moderate expectations, I can happily say this young ensemble does not make nearly as much fun of their respective characters as I was dreading. Forget Justin Timberlake, he is slowly but steadily beginning to pay his acting dues. The fact that almost everyone in this cast were wannabe tough guys, stoners or sluts did not bode well for a convincing docudrama. When focusing the plot around a crime and a bunch of young, dumb kids, history has usually yielded off-point, self-indulgent, exploitive hysterics coming from unconvincing brats in place of the sobering reminders meant to actually effect the youth they are marketed at instead of furthering desensitization. Sure there are plenty of unintentionally goofy moments coming from these eager kids, a little too hungry to portray their intoxicated ambitions convincingly and in proportion to the scene and story (and let's not forget the simultaneously effective and laughable post-crime Sharon Stone interview debacle), but mostly the acting keeps viewer attention remaining on the outcome. Emile Hirsch hardly looks and feels the part (as it is even inferred by his enemies) but holds a strong enough screen presence to dignify his casting. Anton Yelchin is perhaps most convincing as the 15 year old victim, radiating an innocence central to the film, but his older brother, played by Ben Foster, goes way over the top, even for the crazed-out speed freak he is supposed to be. The rest of this cast, including Timberlake, try their hardest not to embarrass us too much, and succeed more often then not.Alpha Dog works because it does not try overly hard to be more then heavy entertainment. The split screens seemed rather unnecessary, the repetitious partying-excessive, but they are just there to ease us into a deceptively depressing turn of events which highlight, in a relatively convincing manner, the ludicrous rationale behind impressionable minds with nowhere to turn. For these brief excursions into the terrifying mindsets of a lobotomized American culture, the movie is strikingly resonant, but for the most part a sensationalized dramatization will suffice.",Alpha Dog
52,Isaac5855,"It's ten o clock...do you know where your children are?""",8,5 December 2007,"ALPHA DOG is a raw and uncompromising documdrama, shockingly based on a true incident, which showcases a group of rich, bored youth with too much time and money on their hands, their outrageous behavior, poor choices, and their shock at coming face to face with the obvious consequences of what they do, even though that's not what this film is about. Written and directed by Nick Cassavettes, the film chronicles what happens when a rich drug dealing punk, surrounded by his ass-kissing posse of yes-men, impulsively abducts the baby brother of a whacked-out addict who owes him money and the downward spiral this spontaneous and stupid move takes. But that's not what this film is about either...this film is not about kidnapping, or the evil of drugs, or the danger of having too much time or money. As explained in the opening scene, this story is about bad parenting. This story is about what parental neglect can lead to. This story is about what happens when your kids leave the house and you don't ask them where they're going, what they will be doing, who they'll be doing it with, and what time they'll be back. This story is about parents who put their own selfish needs above their children, despite the fact that the number of parents who are part of this story is limited, which is exactly the point. Cassavettes, who has clearly inherited some of his dad's cinematic eye, treats us to some inventive camera-work and an improvisational directorial style. As a screenwriter, he has mounted a compelling story though dialogue sometimes borders on the cliché. Emile Hirsh is miscast as Johnny Truelove, the drug dealer at the center of the story. Hirsh works hard at trying to make his character menacing, but never really is convincing in the role. The rest of the cast, however, is excellent, including Hip Hop icon Justin Timberlake in his film debut. Special mention should also be made of Ben Foster, as the psycho addict who puts his baby brother in danger, Anton Yelchin as the baby-faced hostage, and Sharon Stone as Yelchin's mother, who has one extraordinary scene near the end of the film. This film is shocking, raw, ugly, mean-spirited, unpleasant...and riveting from start to finish.",Alpha Dog
53,Dan1863Sickles,So Real It's Shocking -- So Shocking It's Unreal!,9,4 August 2010,"A loser junkie tries to cheat his dealer -- so the dealer's wasted teen friends kidnap the junkie's innocent, lovable little brother. Once the kid brother is with the hoods, he finds out that he likes their life -- but then things take a darker turn.The plot alone doesn't come anywhere near doing this movie justice. What looks like a quick, sexy movie about teen drug dealers in an affluent California suburb turns into an incredibly wrenching, honest, and tragic experience. The cast is spectacular. There is not a single false note in a single performance. Not in the funny moments, and not when things take a turn towards unspeakable horror. Hollywood legends like Bruce Willis and Harry Dean Stanton and Sharon Stone do their best work in years. Newcomers like Anton Yelchin, Justin Timberlake, Ben Foster, and Emile Hirsch all show nuance and sensitivity in their acting -- then nearly burn the screen down with testosterone, attitude, and sheer youthful intensity.People have tried to tell this story before. Back in the Eighties, there were movies like AT CLOSE RANGE, BAD BOYS, and RIVER'S EDGE, all of which dealt with ""aimless, blank"" teens and their casual route to crime. There were some fine performances in those films. But all of them were basically melodramas, not tragedies. And there was always, especially in RIVER'S EDGE, a smug sense of Baby Boomer superiority, a sense that THESE kids are soulless, but OUR generation was pure.This time the story is more real, more honest. The helpless victim is a sensitive, decent kid, but far more complex than his role suggests. When you watch the sensual, seductive Marco Polo scene, it's hard not to think of ancient Aztec rituals, where the brave young warrior was given great honor and fair maidens before his ritual sacrifice. By the same token, the executioners are chilling not because they've lost all feeling, but because all of them -- literally all of them -- are deeply tormented by what they're doing. They just lack any firm set of principles and any adult guidance.It's no accident that in this movie, Bruce Willis and the other adult actors are shown to be just as venal, manipulative, and murderous as the children they raise. As Willis' cynical father-figure says with mordant irony, the tragedy that unfolds is really all about parental neglect.There are no serious flaws in this dark masterpiece, but I would like to end with a couple of minor annoyances. The opening credits, with innocent children frolicing about, are a little too obvious -- especially with ""Over The Rainbow"" playing in the background. Also, the soundtrack is exclusively gangsta rap. I understand the point about aimless white kids imitating the ""thug"" lifestyle with tragic results. But the idea of ""innocent"" white kids listening to ""evil"" black music really sends the wrong message. Young black men are not the only killers in our society, or the only people who glamorize violence. After all, it was Johnny Cash, not Tupac Shakur, who became a star by bragging about how he ""shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die."" But make no mistake -- ALPHA DOG is an American classic.",Alpha Dog

The drugdealer underestimates the power of a junkie, and creates more problems for himself when he holds the junky's brother ransom to get his money. Cassavetes does well with this project, as it does a good job capturing how drug dealers and those associated with crime in areas like the San Gabriel Valley.

55,the-movie-guy,This Alpha Dog won't hunt,5,12 January 2007,"(My Synopsis) Inspired by actual events on the life of Jesse James Hollywood, Alpha Dog revolves around a small time drug dealer in San Gabriel Valley, California, during the late 1990's, who becomes the youngest man ever to appear on the ""FBI's Most Wanted"" list. At 20, Johnny Truelove aka Hollywood (Emile Hirsch) is a young man whose lifestyle is a popular place for his friends to party and do whatever they wanted such as smoke pot, have sex, curse, and drink. But all good things come to an end when one of Johnny's drug dealers, Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster), tries to cheat him out of $1,200. At that point everybody's life is about to change. Jake's 15-year old brother, Zack (Anton Yelchin), is kidnapped and held as collateral to get the money that Jake owes Johnny. This is not your typical kidnapping, because Zack begins to party with his kidnaper's and all of their friends. Zack doesn't want to go back home even though he was free to go several times, because everybody likes him, and he is now a member of the gang. However, when the police get involved, things change for Johnny and his gang. (My Comment) Most of the movie is comprised of kids smoking pot, cursing, and non-stop partying. It is the usual tragic outcome that kids can fall into when they are given too much free time and money without parental supervision. Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone have small parts in the movie, but it doesn't help the movie because of the writing. However, on the bright side, Justin Timberlake does a good job of acting and making his character real. None the less, the writing was not good, because the actor's lines and character development were lacking. The decision that Johnny makes at the end of the movie is one horrible tragedy that any young person could make when they are using drugs. You can wait to see this movie on DVD, because if you have seen the trailer, you have seen the whole movie. (Universal Pictures, Run time 1:57, Rated R)(5/10)",Alpha Dog
56,dragokin,life writes the best scripts,8,23 June 2013,"The cast of Alpha Dog has a lot of heavyweights, some of whom where already major-League actors and celebrities at the time of it's creation. Some of them have meanwhile arrived there, so if you're watching it for the first time, you'll probably see a lot of actors you've seen elsewhere.However, i've heard almost nothing about Alpha Dog which led me to the believe that it is another movie you rent on DVD and fast-forward through it or do something else as it's playing. Well, i was wrong.The whole cast delivers an excellent performance. The banality of acts committed by the characters is at times frightening. I kept asking myself what led the hostage to act so meek toward his kidnappers. Was it his age and the fact that his parents kept him isolated from the realities of life? They surely wanted the best for their kid but, as any teenager, he got bored of that. Partying, drinking, smoking pot and meeting girls must have been much more appealing that writing homework, even if he was initially taken there against his will.Beware, Alpha Dog is heartbreaking at times.EDITIt is seldom that i think of a movie as much as i've reminisced about Alpha Dog. There are several reasons for that. One is the tragic true story of a harmless young man punished by idiots for no reason whatsoever.The other is the gallery of characters we meet in the movie: Nazi-Jews (sic), stoned teenagers and an occasional careless parent. One mother stuck in my memory, boosting her wedding anniversary by ecstasy.The final is again the performance of the cast.

59,richieandsam,Powerful and sad!,7,24 October 2013,"ALPHA DOGThis was not what I expected. I didn't really know much about this film. I recorded it off of the TV because it said it had Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone in it little did I know that they had very small parts.The movie is a drama about a group of 20 something's all running around in gangs, smoking pot, causing trouble and waving guns around. A rival starts up between Johnny Truelove and Jake Mazursky over an unpaid debt The rivalry really takes a nasty turn when Johnny kidnaps Jakes brother. All of a sudden, this group of guys has a hostage that actually enjoys hanging out with them. This group are completely useless and have no experience in this kind of thing. It all gets out of control.The story is based on actual events. We all know that this means that there are a few real parts, but the rest has been completely made up. But either way, this film is very well put together. It is a very interesting story. It is a shame that these guys lives were ruined by something so stupid. It felt like this was an on the spot decision that they will regret for the rest of their lives. It is a sad film in places. You grow to actually like a couple of these guys but you also really hate a couple of them. It is also very annoying when a character who is the leader of a gang is actually gutless. He lies to his gang to make himself look like the big hard leader, but in reality he hides when there is trouble.The casting was very good. The actors were Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, Justin Timberlake, Vincent Kartheiser, Shawn Hatosy, Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone. There was not one bad actor in this film. They all did great jobs.The drama was very gripping in this. You really want this film to have a happy ending, but you don't know what is going to happen until you see it.

60,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Sings notes we have heard before, and often out of tune at that",5,7 April 2007,"Idyllic family footage melts into a dog-eat-dog teenage criminal underworld in Hollywood, documenting an unfortunate turn of events in the life of Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsh), loosely based on Jesse James, the youngest man to ever grace the list of F.B.I's most wanted. Alpha Dog hedges its story around an unorthodox kidnapping, straying from its template, central characters and indeed point, until it has slotted itself in with the rest of forgettable crime teen romps.Acting-wise, it is mainly obnoxious teens acting like adults acting like pimps and gangsters, recycling ""fuck"" in every sentence to instill the authenticity in the way in which things are run. A squeaky-voiced Justin Timberlake incongruously dons tattoos and wife-beaters by the bucketload, while Emile Hirsh gets his Mexican thug on, and Ben Foster shamelessly emulates Edward Norton's performance in American History X, often to surprisingly good ends. You'll know what I'm talking about. Bruce Willis makes an extended cameo, as does Sharon Stone, but blink in the midst of all the teenage party nostalgia (which is bound to happen) and you're likely to miss both appearances. In short, the acting side of the tapestry is nothing to write home about.Nick Cassavetes makes no genuine attempt to communicate with the audience in Alpha Dog, unlike his earlier film ""The Notebook"" in which he milked every frame worth its emotional, aesthetic and dramatic appeal. There is plenty of the latter in this film as the testosterone-fuelled teenage gangsters plough through a checklist of almost clichéd scenarios (sex, drugs, drinking, fighting, kidnapping, swearing -- OK, you're criminal, we get it), but these events line up to the cumulative effect of having become routine in Alpha Dog. The script comprises of far too many uninspired, gratuitous ""party shots"" with no other purpose than to give the audience a feel for the protagonists' lifestyles. For that matter, we are presented with a very documentary-like presentation where Cassavetes just seems to station his camera and record the meanderings of juvenile delinquents.Having said all of this, rabid fans of the crime genre might still be sporadically entertained, for Alpha Dog features Guy Ritchie undertones -- however pale and marginal -- and there are some quasi-ambitious attempts to insert a ""cool MTV"" style fit for the X and Y gen, mostly done by mixing and pasting several frames onto one. As another strong suit, its content matter is almost automatically engaging. We love teenagers in trouble -- and we love teenagers having sex, right? 5.5 out of 10",Alpha Dog
61,dead47548,Surprisingly not horrific.,6,8 January 2008,"Better than I would have expected. It does, however, fall into the typical Hollywood aimed at teens and gangsters trait at being completely over the top and ridiculously unrealistic at times. Some of the decisions these character make are so pathetic and unbelievable, that it's simple impossible to believe they were based on true events. It goes out of it's way to appeal to the hip teen crowd and draw in more box office, that it comes to the point of annoyance very often. I can't help but commend the film, however, on it's ability to remain engaging and very interesting while staying true to the actual events that transpired. The performances range from good (Emile Hirsch, Justin Timberlake surprisingly) to mediocre (Bruce Willis, Shawn Hatosy) to one of the worst I've ever seen in the form of Sharon Stone. I wanted to vomit when she donned that fat suit and overacted her career out the window some more. The real surprise of the film is Ben Foster, though, who delivers one of the most eccentric and powerful performance of the year so far in a role that should have been expanded to it's own film. Foster proves once again that he is one of the most talented and underrated actors of his generation in a performance that is just way too good for the film that it's in. His dedication is astounding. He truly is the last remaining hope of a beautiful breed of performers known as 'method actors'. Once Crowe and Bale hang up their flags, Ben Foster will be the last one around and that is such a shame since I easily call them the greatest actors in existence",Alpha Dog

With fantastic performances from Sharon Stone, Justin Timberlake, Emile Hirsch, and Anton Yelchin, Alpha Dog takes the cake already as being one of the best movies of 2007.The acting in Alpha Dog is top-notch. I've always been the biggest Justin Timberlake fan in the universe, and I had seen how his acting was in Edison Force, but he really kicked things up several notches for his sensational performance as Frankie Ballenbacher. For me, Justin Timberlake was what made this movie. I can't wait to see what else he can do in the near future. Anton Yelchin was superb as Zack Mazurskythis was certainly Anton's best performance yet. The kid shows potential to become a great actor. Emile Hirsch was also at the top of his game in one of his best performances yet. I've always loved the guy since I saw him in The Girl Next Door, but here he really proves he can act. Ben Foster was good as usual, and Sharon Stone was amazing for what little she had to work with. Bruce Willis felt very underused, but he was decent.The story is engaging and never really seemed to slow down. Nick Cassavetes is at his best here behind the director's chair, and the style and feel of the movie is very gritty and realistic.

68,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,Powerful and realistic. Well done by Cassavetes and Timberlake.,8,19 July 2007,"Alpha Dog starts off as what seems like a movie all about a group of friends who life their idea of the American dream: doing drugs, having sex, and hanging out with each other not a care in the world. However, when their leader, Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch), decides to kidnap the brother (Anton Yelchin) of a man (Ben Foster) who owes him drug money, their perfect world begins to shatter as they realize that their mindless prank has become a situation that could get them stuck in jail for the rest of their lives.The acting is pretty good considering the cast is mostly young men with little to no experience. First, you have Anton Yelchin, whom the plot centers around. He is the young man trying to grow up, and finds a real sense of comfort in his captors, as weird as it sounds. He does a great job building a likable, yet flawed character. The film definitely displays likable characters, but the audience has to remember that these characters are not good people. Ben Foster has always been around in my eyes, and he delivers his most intense role yet as the scary and sadistic Jake Mazursky. Very good job. Emile Hirsch is steadily developing into a good leading man after nice turns in Lords of Dogtown and The Girl Next Door. He's the leader of the group, and he has a certain presence despite his small size that reminds the viewer who's in command. Sharon Stone continues to defy my expectations of her after watching her in Bobby and this film. Very intense and powerful performance, which is very heartfelt at the end of the film. However, none of these performances stack up close to that of GASP Justin Timberlake. Timberlake really stood out to me in the film as Frankie, Johnny's best friend. He develops a strong friendship with Yelchin's character, and Timberlake really steals the show the whole time. His character is the most believable and likable of the bunch. Bruce Willis and Shawn Hatosy are also good in limited screen time (I don't think I've seen Willis have this much hair in a long time).Nick Cassavetes does a good job as director, giving us the exact opposite of his most famous work to date, The Notebook. He delivers the gritty and realistic feel of 1999 Southern California and gets great performances out of actors who you don't really expect it from. The film definitely was better than I expected because of Justin Timberlake. I thought he would make the film worse but he made it better. It has some sex scenes and nudity, not to mention a lot of language, so Alpha Dog isn't really appropriate for anyone under 16 or 17.

As an adult, I found it difficult to have any empathy for the young ""Alpha males"" except for the brilliant role of Anton Yelchin as Zack. He is so wonderful in his role and captures the innocence of a 15 year old and his final horrifying scenes are ones to remember. And Ben Foster as Zack's brother is sensational in a role that is both powerful and frightening at the same time.

This is a tough review to write because I certainly don't want to spoil it. Someone said, ""The film was amazing, heart wrenching towards the end, and very very well done,"" I agree with that 100%. Especially the heart wrenching description. I'll say this right now. Nothing, NOTHING prepares you for the climax of the film. And what's absolutely amazing is that, being based on a true story, we already know going in how it ends. Can you imagine what an amazing feat of film-making that is? To make a movie, where many KNOW the ending going in, and yet walk away feeling so emotionally devastated and drained that it's hard to talk about afterward?I was blown away. Absolutely blown away. Even knowing all that I knew, the story, the actors, the characters, even knowing all that, the emotional wave that takes over and propels the film through its last act is just beyond any words. I can truly say that I will remember the ending of this film for the rest of my life. Throw away everything you THINK this film is about. Because it is not. I had absolutely no idea what was going to happen to me emotionally and I was absolutely devastated. This film MUST be seen.My biggest fear is that people won't go to see this film because of preconceived notions about what it involves. The other is that they won't stay with it long enough to see the real story develop. In my opinion, this is not about drug dealers or white suburban kids acting tough or sex or drugs or a gang that lived lives of excessive behavior. This is not an R-rated Afterschool Special on the dangers of spoiled youth running wild. Or a bunch of kids who went bad. Yes, all these elements are there and play a part. But anyone who thinks that's the essence of the story, and doesn't give it a chance, will miss out on what I believe is one of the most moving and powerful sequences ever captured on film.I'll tell you right now that I was not expecting this film to turn out the way it did. I don't want to give too much away, but director Nick Cassavetes has described it as an ensemble cast, and I agree somewhat. Nobody is really ""the star"" of the film. If we break it down into 3 acts, here is how I would describe it, if I absolutely had to answer that question.ACT 1: Emile Hirsch -- the story centers on him, to some extent.ACT 2: Justin Timberlake -- the story moves to his character. I was actually surprised at how his role begins to grow as Emile's ""diminishes."" Although remember, these are just very rough opinions on my part.ACT 3: And THIS was the big surprise for me -- Anton Yelchin. At one point I actually heard myself saying in my head that he is the star of this movie, if there is one.I could go on...Ben Foster, Shawn Hatosy, Chris Marquette, Sharon Stone, Amanda Seyfried, Dominique Swain, Olivia Wilde, Bruce Willis...I put them in alphabetical order because it wouldn't be fair to rank them. All turn in shockingly powerful performances. But the story is not about Emile's character. It's not about Justin's character. It is about Anton's character. That was the biggest surprise for me and I was not prepared for how emotional the film would get towards the end. As director Nick Cassavetes himself said in the Q&A after the screening, Anton is ""the heart and soul of the film."" Just a warning...it is very hard to watch in parts. The bottom line is this: the first act of the film sets the scene for what these guys' lives were like. The language, the violence, the drugs, the sex, they were all a part of their lifestyle and it is not sugarcoated. But more importantly, it is an assault on the senses because without it, the rest of the film -- and the emotional impact it has -- wouldn't be as believable. You have to experience how sick these guys' behavior was on a daily basis to appreciate and understand how sick were the actions they take later in the film. And it's the actions that they take later in the film that are at the heart of what the movie is about.The first half of the film is hard to sit through. But the second half makes it all worth it. You cannot get the goose bumps and feel the emotions and the heartbreak of their crime without knowing how depraved these guys were. It is a film with one of those moments -- about halfway through the film, just when you think you know what it's about, just when maybe you're starting to wonder if it's really going to be worth watching, that feeling begins to come over you. That feeling that says, ""ohhh wait a minute. NOW I see what's going on here."" Then the tears start to well up as you begin to realize what this is really all about.Once the real story starts to unfold, you forget about the language and the violence and the drugs and the sex. Because now you have entered their world, and the emotional impact of what comes later is just heart wrenching. This is one of those rare films that deserve the label ""important."" It is polarizing, to be sure. It's not everyone's cup of tea. But if you keep an open mind and are willing to suspend disbelief for a couple of hours (although, ironically, this is based on a true story) you will be moved, you will be affected, and you will be changed. ""Alpha Dog"" will do that, and that's a rare feat of film-making.",Alpha Dog
73,BreanneB,Excellent Movie! Ben Foster Is The Best Act!,10,14 January 2007,"This movie was excellent. Ben Foster did the best acting. Everything else was great about it too, acting, script, following the story as it really happened, music, production, costumes, directing, photography.One scene I thought was pretty funny was when Zack goes over to his brother Jake's and his fiancée's house and she comes to the door in her birthday suit. I also thought it was funny when Zack went swimming in the motel's pool with those girls in his birthday suit. I thought the beginning was really cute when they showed the video of them as little sluggers playing ""Over The Rainbow"" by Martina McBride.Although, there were some scenes I absolutely hated, especially when little Zackey gets killed, thats the absolute worse. The others were when the Mazurskys refused to help Jake out and when his father called him a son of a bitch. Also, I really hate it when they abduct Zack and beat him up.Two Thumbs Way Up! 10 out of 10 golden stars. IT REALLY ROCKS!

Off the bat you've got a great cast who gel very well as an entourage playing OG wannabes and then in comes the magic of this film. Its basically watching the lives of a crew on a mad unstable weekend, so well made, forgetting its a movie & then..it's also based on a true story, a very tragic one but done to near perfection and 2 honourable mentions for the jewish brothers whose rolea were 10/10 .. all in all a 8+/10 and a very good watch.",Alpha Dog
75,moviemaniac008,"Awesome, touching story",8,6 July 2009,"I'll start off with the main bad point of the movie: It seems over-exaggerated in every way possible. Drug consumption, language, even Jake's fight in the bar seemed exaggerated (normally in a bar fight, you rarely give out kung-fu kicks). And surprisingly, sex is basically the only thing I found in this movie to not be exaggerated. At least, not too much. However, an exaggerated movie does not make it bad, if you want a proof of that, I can automatically tell you that I enjoyed Wanted (2008). But in Alpha Dog, it seemed to be a bit too much, in fact, this is the first movie that I get tired of hearing too many F-words. But still, in all the other ways possible, I found it to be a great movie.The actors themselves were pretty good, particularly Justin Timberlake (surprisingly). Emile Hirsch was good but in some scenes he didn't seem to achieve his full acting potential. Bruce Willis was very convincing and Sharon Stone was pretty good, but sometimes (I'm thinking the ending scene), she over-exaggerated. The real star of the movie was Anton Yelchin, who portrayed Zack. That kid's got incredible talent. Overall, the script was very well written and the story was sad. I didn't cry, but I will admit that I was shocked and felt pretty sad that the story happened in real life. I would also like to congragulate the parents of the young Nicholas who had to live through the media around this movie and the movie itself. Getting over your son's death must have been pretty harsh, and living it a second time must have been even worst. Kudos!",Alpha Dog
76,das417,Modern Day American Tragedy,8,23 June 2008,"The suburbs were created by middle class Americans who had tired of the inner city life. Wanting to escape the growing crime and congestion of the city, those who made the suburbs their home also wanted a safer environment for their children. Large homes, parks, better schools, and safe streets were the driving cause behind the belief that the suburbs were safe from the dangers of urban life. The dreamy song ""Over the Rainbow"", made famous from the Wizard of Oz and which plays over homemade videos of children and their families enjoy life, is the perhaps the best way Alpha Dog reveals a world where the idea of the safety and innocence the suburbs offered was destroyed.Sonny Truelove (Bruce Willis) is perhaps one of those men who wanted such a life for himself and his son Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch). However, Sonny is far from the father knows best parent and instead is active in the drug dealing world which his son Johnny is taken as well. The result of this has made Johnny in particular wealthy for his age. Not only does he have his own home but he is able to provide for his ""gang"" which includes Frankie Ballenbacher (Justin Timberlake), Elvis Schmidt (Shawn Hatosy), Tiko 'TKO' Martinez (Fernando Vargas), and other would be criminals and delinquents who enjoy the booze and drugs that Johnny offers. These are kids who have also enjoyed stable suburban life and the opportunities it has offered. However, unlike those of their age who go to college to earn their own way in the world, Johnny and his friends have instead taken to a life of endless nihilism and empty materialism.Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster) is one of Johnny's partners in dealing. However, Jake finds himself owing Johnny money after one such deal failed. A lesser man perhaps would have easily caved into the machismo of Johnny and his threats but Jake, despite being an addict and otherwise troublemaker himself, is able to see through Johnny's facade of being a ""gangster"". In what amounts to an open insult made in front of Johnny's ""gang"", Jake challenges Johnny to follow up with his threats.It would be a challenge that would have ramifications far beyond what anyone could have imagined.Zack Mazursky (Anton Yelchin) is the opposite of his older brother Jake in almost every way. Still living at home with his well to do parents, Zack is the very idea of an innocent kid who believes himself able to conquer the world without realizing what exactly the real world is. Watched over by his protective mother Olivia (Sharon Stone), Zack openly rebels by embracing his troubled brother and attempts to follow him despite the problems that Jake finds himself surrounded with. His will be a decision that would also contribute to the tragedy that will consume not just the Mazursky family but everyone who ever became involved with Johnny Truelove.Alpha Dog is a unique movie in more ways than one. Based upon the true life events surrounding Jesse James Hollywood who was placed on the FBI's top ten most wanted list after the kidnapping and murder of a brother an associate, Alpha Dog tells this story with a cinematic flare. Part standard drama, part ""documentary"", the events of Alpha Dog are told both from a standard story plot while moving forward into the future where the primary characters find themselves telling about the events in the past tense. It's a complicated set up that doesn't work as well as the director and writer would have wanted but it does add some depth to the story.As with the real life Jesse James Hollywood, Johnny Truelove makes the fateful decision to kidnap the younger Mazursky brother in order to make his brother pay. However, in doing so, Johnny and his friends adopt the young Zack into their group as if he were a young kid they took under their wings. This is particularly true for Frankie who takes a special liking to Zack and looks after him as if he were his own brother. Instead of behind held as a real hostage, Zack is treated to drugs, girls, and parties where life couldn't be better for a teenage boy wanting to escape from home.Johnny realizes that he has made a mistake by kidnapping Zack and that he faces serious charges. In decision that is part desperation and part trying to show how dangerous and in control he really is, Johnny decides that Zack must be killed. Elvis and Frankie are recruited for the job though Frankie up until the very moment of Zack's death is remorseful though not enough to save his life. It is thus that Zack, an innocent kid from the same suburbs as Johnny and everyone else in his kidnapping, has his life ended under a peaceful California night far from home.Alpha Dog is a moving story of how shameless greed, ego, pride, and fear lead to disaster for a dozen lives. Johnny is able to flee the country while leaving behind his friends to face arrest and imprisonment. Johnny is arrested himself (much like the real life Jesse) and brought back to face trial though by this time it is doubtful his arrest could bring much closer to the lives he destroyed. There is no going back to the troubled and spoiled lives that these kids used to know.If there is a lesson to be learned from this tragedy its that our choices have real consequences. Alpha Dog is a modern day tragedy that shows that even our ideas of a safe home are not enough to protect us from the real world. Johnny, Frankie, Elvis, Zack, and the others could have had the world at their feet. Instead, they threw it all away and paid the ultimate price.8/10",Alpha Dog
77,nixskits,"Names changed, facts still the same",9,4 December 2009,"Anytime one watches a film based on real events, you've got to wonder how close to what actually went on is recreated? ""The Onion Field"" was a class act, taking authenticity seriously in filming it's abduction scene at the intersection of Carlos and Gower in LA where the 1963 crime took place, with officers who were on duty that long ago night there as technical advisers.How much of ""Alpha Dog"" gets it right? I didn't pay much attention to Jesse James Hollywood when his profile on ""America's Most Wanted"" aired, other than thinking this guy is a dangerous fool who needs to be locked up for the rest of his life (at least!). The film knocked me out, with some of the best talent working today in major roles. Justin Timberlake gives his best performance so far, playing the babysitter to a hostage that nearly has a reverse Stockholm syndrome change his mind about how to deal with the younger brother of a drug deal scam artist. Anton Yelchin is almost too fragile to watch, painfully naive about what his sibling and the criminal ties he's cultivated truly means for him. Emile Hirsch is once again amazing as the half assed punk ""in charge"", who thinks he's in control and at best, just barely sees beyond his felon's myopia. And Ben Foster is so intense as the live wire who's ruined more than just his own future, he practically leaps off the screen!The adults who have children in ""Alpha Dog"" are scary too, for different reasons. Bruce Willis' character is such a smug excuse for a dad, it's not surprising he vomits up a line right out of ""The Onion Field"", ""I'm a taxpayer and a citizen!"", like that justifies anything he did or didn't do in the rearing of his law breaking brat son. And Sharon Stone is simply horrifying, her mom of a slain child out of her mind with grief.

I don't remember it getting much of a release back in 2006, and I am not surprised. It's not a bad movie, but not much better than that.After a slow start, the film has a few interesting things to say about the Californian youth culture, and paces nicely toward an end in which I have to admit I was engaged. Justin Timberlake (in the midst of his transformation from music star to acting star) stands out as one of the slackers/wannabe gangsters who kidnap a kid and then don't know what to do with him, and the young cast are ably supported by veterans Bruce Willis, Harry Dean Stanton and Sharon Stone.It is interesting to see a film which only becomes interesting when the action *stops* rather than starts.

79,Newsense,Alfalfa Dawg,1,22 September 2008,"I'm amazed. This is the most reprehensible piece of tripe that I've ever sat through. It still gets a lot of undeserved accolades.The story/ plot: Johny Truelove(Emile Hirsch) kidnaps Zach(played by Anton Yelchin) just because Zach's brother owed him money. So he and a few of his friends including Frankie(played by Justin Timberlake) take the kid out of town and end up killing him when Johnny Truelove's irrational fear of getting busted by the cops kicks in.Opinion: This movie is pure crap. Despite the plot description, it's really about a bunch stupid a** suburbanites doing stupid things and while acting like wegroes. The main part of this ""film""'s flaws is that it rarely focuses on Johnny Truelove and focuses on him and his crew of spineless idiots doing stupid things and aping Black people(or how they perceive that most black people act)most of the time. The acting is terrible and let me tell you that Justin Bimbolake gets way too many undeserved kudos for his role when all he did was act like a wegro. If you wouldn't give some Black actors props for aping valley people then why give this teenybopper icon kudos for doing his worse wegro impression? It just makes no sense. And to compare this movie to Goodfellas.. are you bonkers? The men in Goodfellas were scum but were played well by great actors plus Martin Scorsese was and still is a great director. None of these ignorant suburban kids can act and Nick Cassevettes has more failures then successes as a director. Bruce Willis chews up scenery like he hasn't eaten in months and Sharon Stone...its hard to take her seriously when she looks like Jiminy Glick(especially during the last 20 minutes of the movie). There are the other flaws also. If this movie is about Johnny Truelove being wanted by the F.B.I. then it would make sense that you show how he came to be so despicable. Nobody is born a varmint. Instead we are treated to a bunch of filler scenes that do nothing to enhance the story and we have to deal with unanswered questions(like how a kid who is supposedly a black belt has the backbone of a chicken MCnugget) and nobody in this movie has a conscious. The people in this movie remain vile and ignorant throughout the movie. Its funny. The stereotypes of white teens is so over the top that you have to be stupid not to be offended by them but people are praising this mind-numbing dreck while throwing hissy fits over ill-timed and cheesy racial jokes in deadly dull comedies like Who's Your Caddy, How High, Underclassman, In The Mix and Norbit. Are you people insane are what? I can see people being offended by Soul Plane because that movie was ambitious in its awfulness and had a real mean streak but movies like Who's Your Caddy, How High, Underclassmen and In The Mix are unambitious and have a dull streak and can only offend people who are extremely bored and are mentally unstable. Anybody else would be bored to tears by those ""movies"". This movie is just as ambitious as Soul Plane in its badness and offensiveness and instead a telling a story about some dumb kid who ended up being one of FBI's most wanted, Alpha Dog seems to be bent on showing white kids acting really stupid. Where's your sense of outrage in all this? Wasted on some lame comedy that even black people denounce. You psychotic hams! My heart goes out to those poor and unfortunate souls that have you bipolar fruit loops as friends.

The story caught me and I was very in. Director Nick Cassavetes had some of his trademarks used really well.It was nice to see Bruce Willis in his own element. Such a boss. Always has something to say with a point in his mind. Young talents such as Emile Hirsch and Anton Yelchin were good. Justin Timberlake and especially Ben Foster gave the best performances.

81,toddg-473-289818,loses credibility,5,4 May 2013,"Realizing that this is a true crime movie, the screenwriters took a lot of license in what they created. My disappointment with this movie isn't in the story that was told, but the evolution of the characters from beginning to end. We start out watching Johnny Truelove, this supposed bad boy drug dealer/gangster, of whom everyone is fearful. He dictates orders to Elvis Schmidt, who is indebted to Truelove to the point of humiliation and slavish obedience. Truelove's conflict with a hothead named Jake Mazursky is shown early in the movie, with the rest of the movie revealing how the kidnapping of Mazursky's younger brother by Truelove's crew will be resolved. At this point, other reviewers can recount the rest of the story, as I would rather describe the high and low points that followed. First, Truelove's transition from intimidating and street smart gang leader to incompetent bungler was not credible to me. While his character looked to manipulate his cohorts into deciding, and hopefully taking the fall for, what to do with a kidnapped 15 year old boy, he simply wasn't believable in turning into a shell of his former self. Lead actor Emile Hirsch lacks the depth to pull this off. Second, we are never told why, other than money, Schmidt is so deeply indebted to Truelove. One would think that the degradation suffered by Schmidt would be enough to motivate him to seek a way out from under Truelove's thumb, rather than matter-of-factly being willing to commit murder for Truelove. The wannabe gangster angle was by itself not enough to explain that.Third, why would the kidnapped younger brother Zack Mazurksy be so cooperative when he had to know he was being driven into the middle of nowhere to be killed? He had previously demonstrated his worthy martial arts skills, so was therefore capable of defending himself and escaping his captors. For this I blame the screenwriters. Why add this element to Zack's character if it were not to be used later in the film? I found it to be an unnecessary distraction.The high points include two impressive performances. The first was from Justin Timberlake, whom I had not previously seen on screen as an actor. Being talented in pop music is what put him on the map, yet I found his portrayal of Frankie Ballenbacher to be natural and believable. The strongest performance I saw, however, was from Ben Foster, who played the unbalanced Jake Mazursky. Foster did not hold back, and succeeded in making this audience member uncomfortable with the tension and vigor he brought to his performance. Overall, this movie had a lot of potential, especially with Eva Cassidy's very moving rendition of ""Over The Rainbow"" playing in the background of the opening credits. Coupled with home movie clips of innocent children playing (namely Zack), it was foretelling of something tragic that was destined to occur. Unfortunately, the script fell apart the longer the movie went on.",Alpha Dog
82,starlit-sky,An excellent movie about misguided youth,8,15 January 2007,"When I saw the rating of this movie on IMDb.com, I couldn't believe my eyes. This movie definitely deserves a much better rating (around 7 would be the appropriate rating). This is a story about spoiled, misguided teenagers who do nothing but smoke pot, drink and party. Understandably, all of the teenager characters act in accordance with this care-free life style. So, you should expect this sort of behavior from them (a lot of cursing, violence, sex, drug usage, etc.). I think the director did a terrific job of portraying the setting for this type of life style.There are two rival parties of youngsters and one guy, Jake Mazursky, owes some money to another guy, Johnny Truelove. Jake is a typical unruly teenager but his younger brother Zack is a nice kid who seems to have a brighter future than his older brother. But when Jake refuses to pay off his debt to Johnny Truelove, they kidnap his younger brother Zack as a hostage. Surprisingly, Zack develops a nice rapport with his kidnappers; being a nice kid, he easily connects even with the unruly kind. He doesn't even seem to be willing to escape from his kidnappers.This is an excellent film showing the extend of damage that can be caused by the misguided youngsters. They live in a world where even the most stupid acts can be accepted as being ""cool"" or ""desirable"". Too much pot smoking and drugs, not enough oxygen in the brain cells. Are these kids really that stupid or are they stupefied by all the drugs they take? I think this is a movie all parents should watch and they should watch it really carefully before things are too late.",Alpha Dog
83,MatthewLong23,very good movie,10,14 January 2007,"I highly enjoyed this movie. I thought it was really well done and shows how young adults don't think about their actions and how drugs can impair your thinking. It tells the story about a drug dealer who out of anger kidnapps the brother of one of his clients who hasn't paid him yet. They did it just for fun and basically just party with the kid and do drugs. When the drug dealer finds out the consequences of his actions he tries to get his friends to do his dirty work and off the kid which some of his friends are against and think they should just let him go. A lot of the chacters were over the top with how they were talking to their parents and how the parents just acted over all. One scene with one of th dope heads doing karate beating people upw as just stupid and made no sense to the overall story. LIked how they showed what each person got in the end with the crime they committed and i gotta say that if the drug dealer did not end up getting captured i wouldt have found the ending very frustrating. I don't believe his friends deserved what they got as they were following orders but i think they were so impaired they didn't realize what they were doing. Even though the story of the film isn't exactly what happened in real life, i do think the main chacter is not as good person and deserves what's coming to him.",Alpha Dog

The performances are so outstanding that it is difficult to single anyone out. Sharon Stone, however, was somewhere beyond amazing.This disturbing depiction of real-life events is not just about the young drug-dealer and his contemporaries, but about his parent's generation and California and America and humanity. Cassavetes shows us the last vestiges of conscience sparking as if short-circuited, in these kids with their DNA deficiencies. The stunted parents, baby-boomers all, suffer from the indulgences of their parents and from the inconsistent rewards of their culture and time.Overall the movie is a picture of a society that is devolving, eating itself, not because of hunger, but due to boredom and an absence of the necessary definitions and reasons for doing the right thing.A sad and wonderful movie.",Alpha Dog
86,stewiefan201,It may sound surprising but I thought Alpha Dog was one of the best films of 2006.,10,23 February 2008,"Alpha Dog is based on the real life story of a kidnapping gone wrong. The movie is about a rich young drug dealer named Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch) who is living an exciting party-filled life with his friends, but also a very greedy and selfish life. One night he gets into an argument with a friend of his named Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster) who is a struggling drug addict who owes Johnny a lot of money. The two get into a scuffle and become enemies overnight. The next day Johnny and a few friends including Frankie (Justin Timberlake) find Jake's 15 year old brother Zack Mazursky (Anton Yelchin), and kidnap him as revenge against Jake. Johnny leaves Zack in the care of Frankie who quickly becomes friends with the kid, taking him to parties and letting him smoke weed and drink. Zack develops relationships and begins to have fun with Frankie's friends. But soon Johnny and his friends have to face the errors of their ways, and realize the jail sentences they may receive for the kidnapping. They begin to contemplate what to do with Zack to avoid jail time, and eventually shockingly decide that killing him is the only answer.Alpha Dog was not very well marketed. It was the final film shown at Sundance Film Festival, but was only widely released to little over 1000 theaters and raked in about 15 million dollars. But surprisingly I thought this was one of the most effective and unflinching movies of 2006. The main characters are idiot kids who are rich, lazy, and stupid. But they are well acted and also realistic and believable. The movie changes the dates, locations, and names of the true story but besides that is mostly faithful to the real events. Emile Hirsch does a fine job although he's not really memorable. Justin Timberlake gives a great performance and really begins to stand out as an actor in Alpha Dog. Timberlake really quickly ditches his pop star personality and dives right into his role, in fact at many points I forgot it was him acting that's how good he was. Timberlake is definitely a rising star to keep an eye on. Anton Yelchin is also a great actor to keep an eye on because he definitely shows talent on screen. In fact he just came out with a new movie Charlie Bartlett which I'm eager to check out.The violent, hedonistic teenagers in Alpha Dog are very realistic. You know there are people like this out there, and the fact that this is a true story makes the plot all the more interesting for me. For once in a film the main villain (Johnny Truelove) is not some criminal mastermind who shoots and never misses the target. Johnny is a spoiled-rotten idiot who only knows to party, deal drugs, and party some more. He and his friends have no idea how hard it is to get away with a kidnapping and murder, and once they do this they have truly no idea what they've gotten themselves into. I even knew the true story before I saw Alpha Dog. I knew Zack Mazursky was going to brutally die in the end. But I was still shocked and deeply moved by the ending either way.Alpha Dog is a very strong film which to me is very memorable, although maybe not to others. The film to me is very haunting and believable because it just feels all too real. I guess this may be partially because I'm a teenager just like the kids in the film. I can relate to them and understand a lot of what they're going through. I give Alpha Dog a 4 out of 4. I was very surprised I liked it this much, it's a very good film.",Alpha Dog

I wish this film didn't drop an F-bomb every 10 seconds or refer to a male organ.The story was good, but at times, didn't stick to it. It started focusing more on the connection between Timberlake and Yelchin, then starting going into how Johnny Truelove (Hirsch) is in big trouble for kidnapping Yelchin in the first place.

I am not sure what the main boy's name is, but he sure experienced some party life and girls before he died. Some of the homes I am quite fond of. They are well made houses. Justin's character's house was a really good choice to shoot those scenes. The wide angel shot from the Xbox 360 and the TV. Towards the garden really shows how the house fits these kind of scenes.

Not one person with any social redeeming qualities, save for the gal that finally confronts Timberlakes' character with a threat that he'll be sorry!

From beginning to end it is a very good movie with a shocking and very unexpected twist.

His kidnappers treat him well and hes OK with it because he doesn't want to cause any trouble for his half brother(Ben Foster) who owes money to the drug dealing leader of the gang, Jesse James Hollywood(E...mile Hirsch). Written and directed by Nick Cassavetes(The Notebook, My Sister's Keeper) this movie is a change of pace from those movies, this involving many intense scenes(the last 20 minutes being the most disturbing), strong drug use, violence, and strong language(twice as many F bombs as Superbad). It's hard to believe Cassavetes wrote this but I still thought it was a good Crime/Drama. All of the actors do a good job such as Sharon Stone, Bruce Willis, and Harry Dean Stanton(Alien fans may remember him as the guy who had the Alien's inner mouth impale him through the head). Chris Marquette brings some much needed comic relief to an otherwise very serious movie. This movie is good but the last 20 minutes kinda bothered me.",Alpha Dog

94,Dory_Darko,"Intense, shocking, must-see film.",10,30 October 2012,"Going into this film, I had no idea what it was about, only that it was based on a true story. And the more I think about this fact, the truth behind it all, the more it saddens me.The story that unfolded before my eyes last night is not one I'm likely to forget anytime soon. The characters, as I understand, are eerily like the real life people depicted, and all of the actors have done a great job terrifying me, surprising me, and making me feel sadder than any other film I can remember in recent history. Which is by no means meant to discourage you from watching this film, as I believe it is an absolute must-see for anyone who cares about the society we live in.Jake Mazursky, an explosively charged skinhead, owes a large sum of drug money to a young thug called Johnny Truelove. After they get into a fight, Jake retaliates by trashing Johnny's house. Johnny then takes revenge by kidnapping Jake's 15-year-old brother Zack. Surprisingly though, Zack is OK with this, as he trusts his brother to come up with the ransom. In the meantime, Zack forms an unlikely friendship with one of Johnny's cronies, Frankie. But then, as fear starts to spread of having to do hard time, Johnny and his allies make a decision that spins the situation horribly out of control...The character of Jake is played by Ben Foster, and I think he did an amazing job. Some people have suggested that he overacted his part, but I disagree. I think he was very convincing as a strung-out, aggressive, creep of a skinhead. Johnny Truelove, the young gangster, is played by Emile Hirsch, and his role is light years removed from anything he's done so far, and he's as equally impressive and convincing as Ben Foster - just as menacing and intimidating. Actually, he appears almost as though it's not a part he's playing, he's really some thug they plucked off the streets and put in front of a camera. Very impressive. This character in real life is known as Jesse James Hollywood, and he is the youngest person ever to be on the FBI's 'most wanted' list.Zack is played by Anton Yelchin, and he's everything his character requires him to be; young, naive, even a little endearing, and most of all desperate for a little excitement in his life. The role of Frankie is performed by Justin Timberlake, and I must admit, he was better than I would have initially given him credit for. Actually, there wasn't a single actor or actress who was miscast in my opinion. All roles, big and small, were equally well played. I must not forget to mention the parents: Johnny's father is played by Bruce Willis, and even though his part is small, is it crucial. Sharon Stone plays Zack's mother, in a role that is gut wrenchingly emotional and very well played. Although there is one scene at the end where she wears a fat suit, and it's so obvious that it's distracting, and this is a discredit to an otherwise excellent and very important scene (but that's not her fault, of course).What makes Alpha Dog so important, I think, is that's it's a testament of the times we live in. A time where, apparently nobody seems to be shocked anymore about the fact that young people in their teens and twenties lead a lifestyle of drugs and guns and no respect whatsoever for other people's lives and wellbeing. The ease with which some ideas and actions are executed, exemplifies and also amplifies the anarchy and devil-may-care attitude that lives within the hearts and minds of these people. Who cares if you beat a person to within an inch of his life. Who cares if you hurt, damage or even kill another human being, just so long as you can save your own neck. It's dog eat dog in the hierarchical food chain that is life, and this film is a disturbing reminder of that. I thought we'd moved on since the Dark Ages, but apparently I'm mistaken.Aside from the heavy, moral message of this film (which, for once didn't tick me off, but really engaged me), I must also praise it on a technical level. It really is very well made, and it draws you in from the very first second with the beautifully edited opening scene. Director Nick Cassavetes ('John Q') has constructed the story into a balanced, properly paced whole, seemingly letting his actors run free and do what they do best, creating a spontaneous, natural feel and environment. The music is excellent and well dosed.Alpha Dog is a film that you must see at least once if you care about this world and the people in it. It is a portrait of frighteningly laconic individuals and the shockingly low bar to unnecessary violence, and it shows just how easy it is for young people to get involved with all the wrong influences, simply because they have not yet lived long enough to know any better, or lack the proper role models to show them alternative ways.I cannot recommend this film enough. It's heavy - but very, very much worth it.",Alpha Dog
95,sarahmillyhannah,Wow! *possible spoiler*,8,9 October 2011,"First of all I have to say I love Justin Timberlake in films. He is such a better actor than singer. He is great in this. Loved him in Snake Moan and Social Network but he is great in this - almost the good guy, without giving too much away. Yeah the film starts off slow and by the time the deed that the whole film is based upon as stated in the summary happens, i almost lost interest and couldn't decide whether or not to continue with the film. But boy in that instance with that scene my interest was captivated and i was completely engrossed with the film. By the end of the film you will have warmed to two characters the most and when the unspeakable happens at the end it really pulls on your emotions and you feel absolutely gutted. I did. How well acted by these two characters one of which is the fore mentioned JT. It is one of them films that i really want to watch again. Well done to everyone involved in this, it certainly left me feeling like the film had touched me. I love that. I will say though that the language is dire.

96,Dream_seeker,It nearly came close but still good...,6,9 May 2007,"Alpha Dog is a movie directed by Nick cassaventes and the premise if The story is based around the true crime murder of 15-yr. Old Nick Markowitz and the desperate manhunt for Jesse James Hollywood that was actually seen on America's most wanted. Now I Know most people on here called this the worst movie of the year and Others would compare it to another true crime story turned movie Called, ""Bully"" by Larry Clarke but no matter what you think of it good Or bad opinions is opinions but here's my take on what I think of this Movie ready or not here I go.Like I said the story is based off the real life kidnapping that turned Into a murder within 2 days, ""Alpha Dog"" follows the story of Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch) a near 19 yr old drug dealer w/ his own home, a Person with a quick and violent temper, and was somewhat a possible Danger to people around him; kind of falls out of line with his once best Friend Ben Mazursky (Ben foster) over at least $1,200 that he owed from A drug deal/sell which ended with both of them at each other Throats...well a couple of tiffs here and there that leads Johnny, Frankie (Justin Timberlake), Elvis (Shawn Hatosy) to do something Desperate to get back at Ben. Meanwhile, 15-yr old Zack Mazursky (Anton Yelchin) was trying to experience life even though his mother (Sharon Stone) sheltered him in ways seem crazy and after a brief argument w/his father (David Thorton) over a late night outing with his brother Zach escaped out his window and into a world of real life going Terribly wrong.After reading the true crime events and seeing this movie; I felt this Movie overlaps in some areas but worked pretty well in others and Somewhat kept true to the actual events leading up to an end of a short Lived child; Emile's character was somewhat a bit over the top and one Would obviously try to not see him as that squeaky teen white kid from, ""The girl next door"" and in some ways he brought that element into this Role but made it darker and but lackluster but it still worked strange Enough. I have to admit Justin is a pretty good actor playing the Sympathetic but semi-cold Frankie he made the character his own and in a Ways made a good performance that can often make you wonder, ""He should Of just took the boy away before these things happened"" but you know the Outcome before it happens sadly. And Shawn's character of Elvis, the Boy trying badly to fit in had its moments but it fell short being Overtaken by Ben foster's character which was GREAT...a big turn around From being ""Angel"" from X-men, His character was crazy, and a fighter, But I felt he ran its course when it put the cause of his brother's Fate on the hands of a crazy person.Along with other stars like Bruce Willis as Johnny's father, the awe so Sexy Amanda Seyfried (I think so!) as Zach very short love interest, Sharon stone in a somewhat short but good role as the mother, and of Course Anton Yelchin in a role I felt really sorry for...not in a bad Way because he held his own and you want to just tell him to run or fight Or something but he had blind faith that his brother would save him, you knows its not going to happen that way. One can't Compare this movie to, ""Bully"" even though the outline sounds the same The impact is somewhat more dealing with this movie whereas in bully The guy wasn't sympathetic but more of a jackass which EVERYONE wanted To kill....after some gratuities sex scenes that comes out of left field not That this movie doesn't put that there either but it wasn't as Neither forthcoming nor as much as bully (not that I don't think!).I see it like this, with true crime movies like, ""Boys don't cry"" or ""Bully"" where teens out of pure desperation and stupidity commit acts That would make their consequences worse I say this movie did its job. Now was it the best movie of the year...ummm no, will it win any Academy awards...probably not! But for a movie that held its own Despite of what a person views it its still good but it could of came Close to being excellent but it shows a reality that not all endings Are going to be happy and we can't always expect the hero to go home Cause it doesn't always happen and this movie put that out there.",Alpha Dog
97,deltajuliet,I was pleasantly surprised,7,19 January 2007,"It's current 5.7 IMDb rating and mediocre critical reactions left this movie in the back of my mind, but a friend of mine one day told me how Alpha Dog was so great, that he'd be willing to go see it again if I wanted to go. Well, I have yet to turn down a movie. I went, and I liked it immensely.The movie's best aspect, I felt, was the acting. There was great acting all around. I've never cared much for Timberlake, but he shows here that he can be very talented. Ben Foster and Sharon Stone also stand out, which is an accomplishment because it's hard to be noticed when all the acting is good. But the most kudos go to Anton Yelchin. I've never seen him before, but he out-acted some very big names, including Bruce Willis. I look forward to seeing more from this kid in the future.All the characters are also very human; we can sympathize with them. You especially feel for Timberlake's character--he's technically one of the bad guys, but he's trying to do the right thing and you so badly want him to (but you'll have to see the movie to find out if he does...). Yelchin also provides a highlight for the most gut-wrenching scene in the film... I had that sick feeling in my stomach, you know, like if you got pulled over or find out something bad has happened to a loved one or whatever. I think that's a real accomplishment, to make the audience care so much.It's not the most uplifting story ever (think ""Harsh Times"" or ""Lord of War""), but its gripping, and you give a damn about what happens to the people in it. I liked it. I liked it a lot.",Alpha Dog
98,yduric,"An exploitative, useless and pathetic glorification of degeneration",1,26 January 2008,"Did director Nick Cassavetes, who , by the way, hasn't got one hundredth of his father's talent, try to make fun of any viewer with some brains? After watching this obnoxious and nauseating waste of celluloid, I really tend to think: yes. If we examine this Z-graded flick carefully, there is no doubt that his goal was purely exploitative, trying to arouse sympathy for a bunch of completely degenerated scumbags, and attract young audiences in order to put some money in his pockets: first of all, the fact that during the movie, he provides some details of various witnesses who saw one element of what happened at a given time only serves as a mere excuse to try to look 'objective', as if he were to provide some account of what happened or to try to explain it. But any attempt in this direction stops at this point. All the rest is a disgusting and clearly complacent display of the behaviour of completely degenerated characters who think they are like the kings of the world and the very essence of virility. But they are not: on the contrary,they are fundamentally just a bunch of sub-human coward sissies, who, after having kidnapped an innocent young man, are unable to cope with the fact that they will be charged with kidnapping, and so decide in cold blood to kill him. Because, of course, it takes some balls to face real men like bank robbers in jail and get beaten by them, and these balls they never had: it was much easier to kill a defenceless 18-year old boy, hoping you will not get discovered. As for the aspect that the victim had 'the time of his life' during his captivity, I clearly doubt it. This is another way of excusing the actions of these coward jerks, even to glamourize them. To sum up, this is a clearly exploitative and totally nonobjective way of telling a story, which definitely goes in the wrong direction, that of making the viewer sympathize, not with the victim but the kidnappers. But, very hopefully, they got caught and the only thing that fills me up with joy is the hope that other inmates in jail will beat the hell out of them!!!",Alpha Dog
99,jp_011205,Timberlake Surprises,8,1 February 2007,"Taking place in southern California, 'Alpha Dog' is based on the 1999 kidnapping and murder of Nicholas Markowitz (here named Zack Mazursky). Not only does director Nick Cassavetes focus on the obvious ripped from the headlines story, he also zooms in and sheds light on another aspect. That of which being not all gangsters, or wannabe gangsters in this case, are masterminds. Sometimes, the alpha dog is actually the least intelligent member of the pack.Addict Jake Mazursky owes a debt of $1,200 to drug dealer Johnny Trulove. Convinced he will never pay up, Johnny and some of his lackeys kidnap Jake's 15-year-old brother, Zack. What at first is just a simple prank, swiftly becomes a serious situation. Johnny and lackey, Frankie, played by Justin Timberlake, soon find out they could receive a sentence of life in jail for their little ""prank"". Now in a state of worry, they begin to consider their options. Fear of Zack spilling the beans in the end overtakes them and leads to what they believe to be the only solution; murdering the young teen.Opening with an odd montage of old family footage set to 'Over the Rainbow', may leave those who don't know the events the film is based on confused. The confusion only grows as the film finally starts and looks as if to be going nowhere. It's not until Zack's kidnapping everything comes together and the plot is revealed. From here on out the film goes into cruise control keeping almost the same feel up until just before the murder.The main problem though in 'Alpha Dog' lies within its length. It's not really long to begin at one hour and forty-nine minutes. It looks though like there's a lot of idle time. Most of it is taken up by drinking and smoking. The conclusion is even unnecessary. The mock-interview with Zack's mother, Olivia played by Sharon Stone, should have been where the film ends. That would have given the film the power and oomph it aims for, but never quite reaches.As far as the acting seen goes, Justin Timberlake steals the show. At first it's a little hard to accept him as a the suburban thug he's playing. It doesn't take long though before the Frankie's true character comes out, showing he's actually a softy who doesn't want anything bad to happen to Zack. He even tries a few times to let him get away, but Zack doesn't take him up on the offer. This side of the role is much more fitting for Timberlake seeing as he doesn't exactly give off the tough guy vibe.Going into seeing 'Alpha Dog' I didn't expect it to be anything special. The fact it stars Justin Timberlake kind of turned me off to it a little. The fact he turned out to be the only real actor to shine in it really surprised me. He's not the only upside to the film though. Cassavetes presents just enough suspense and emotional distress to make it all work. There's something else too that I can't quite put my finger on that made it appealing. Possibly because even though I knew Zack was going to die, I still held a little bit of hope that he'd live. I really felt bad for Yelchin's character. The lines he gives on the way up the mountain to where his murder takes place all make you want this poor kid to survive the inevitable even more. With that, I'll end with saying out of all the films released in 2007 that I've seen so far, 'Alpha Dog' is the best.",Alpha Dog
100,tawdry_hepburn,An underseen gem,9,28 June 2008,"Occasionally there is one of those movies that just completely slips through the cracks. Usually it's a low to medium budget movie that is either mis-marketed, under marketed or just dumped to die a quick death. A few years later you might discover a movie like this on cable at 3 AM and think, ""whoa, that was actually pretty good."" Films like Running Scared, Wrong Turn, Turistas, Josie and the Pussycats, Can't Hardly Wait, Teachers Pet, Rent, The Fountain, Breach and Win a Date with Tad Hamilton are some recent additions to this sad subgenre of film. And it looks as if Alpha Dog is in prime position to be the new guy.Nick Cassavetes, son of indie film pioneer John, was hot off of his mega hit The Notebook when he picked this true crime story to be his next film. Unfortunately, things were problematic for Alpha Dog from the beginning.The shoot was troubled, even shutting down at one point with no plans for the film to be finished. The film did manage complete principal photography but then sat on the shelf for 2 years getting several re-edits before finally seeing the light of day in the second week of January earlier this year to mediocre reviews and complete disinterest at the box office.As the film prepared for release, Jesse James Hollywood, the real life villain of the piece, played by soon to be Speed Racer, Emile Hirsh, was finally brought to justice. A new ending was filmed and the movie looked to have a new selling hook but after much legal wrangling from Hollywood's wrangling team it became obvious that the film could not be released in conjunction with the sure-to-be-a-media-circus-trail. Worse yet, Hollywood's lawyers tried to have an injunction placed on the release of the film for fear it might poison the jury pool.Of course, none of this behind the scenes drama would matter if what was on screen wasn't any good. Fortunately, it is.Though the film is occasionally over stylized with too many temporal shifts for its own good and a rather obtuse framing story featuring Bruce Willis, most of what's put on screen works. The story, revolving around the real life kidnapping and murder of 15 year old boy by a rich-kid-cum-drug-kingpin, is fairly intriguing and well executed. Even the obviously villainous characters are compelling and never feel like cartoons.All of the acting is top shelf, especially Ben Foster who just drips an oddly charismatic brand sleaze. The usually clean cut Hirsh is a revelation as the total scumbag, Johnny Truelove and Sharon Stone has an absolutely heartbreaking monologue that almost steals the movie at the beginning of the third act.Also of note is Justin Timberlake who is making a very interesting career for himself. Instead of picking the easy romantic leads or action heroes, Timberlake has cut a path of smaller, more complex character roles that imply higher aspirations as an actor than the cross promotion that most musicians get from film roles. At this rate, he's on tap to end of like Mark Walberg instead of Madonna.And there are complex ideas at play here too. More than just being a cautionary tale about too much, too young, the film uses its temporal shifts to extrapolate the human costs of these crimes. There are no less than 4 time periods at play in the movie, each with different make up, different character traits from the same actors. By the time Sharon Stone reaches her monologue we understand that she has been ravaged by years of grief. Her visage has been destroyed and she has been laid bare. The low-fi, documentary feel of her confessional only accentuates the palpable feelings of real pain.It's the same gimmick Cassavetes used in The Notebook, but it's a damn effective tool for showing just how catastrophic events can be. It's a good case for ""the butterfly effect"" (not the Ashton Kutcher film).It really says something about the strength of Cassavetes writing that at the end of the film, it felt tragic. Not just for the dead youth. Not just for his family who lost one son to drugs and another to a horrible murder. I somehow felt bad for the kidnappers. I felt bad for Timberlake, I even felt a little bad for Truelove, who never had a chance. His father, (Bruce Willis, underplaying quiet well) was such a manipulative scum bag, what else was Truelove to become? There are lots of questions, and no easy answers.For more reviews please visit www.collider.com",Alpha Dog
101,ajbo,A Great Film.,8,14 January 2007,"Having learned about the ""Jesse James Hollywood"" case during my junior year in high school, I'll admit that I was actually extremely disappointed to find out that a film was being made depicting the events that had happened. However, I can now say, I think differently.The basic premise, without giving too much away, involves a drug deal gone awry. Someone isn't paying Johnny Truelove, and that someone, just so happens to have a little brother. A naive, fifteen year old, little brother (played powerfully by Anton Yelchin) who just wants to live his life. The boy is kidnapped, and held as a sort of ransom, until Jonny gets his money from boy's brother. Johnny's friends become attached to the boy, and eventually, the boy learns a life lesson.It may all sound played out and done before, but this film is electrifying in every sense of the word. It's hardcore. It's raw. It's at times gritty. (I felt some vibes from the Larry Clark film ""Bully"", with the whole ""kids-doing-what-they-want-anytime-anywhere thing""). You feel as though you're watching these people's lives just crumble before them, making it all the more worse is the grim reality that's stuck in the back of your mind, reminding you that this is all true. Nick Cassavetes has created such a true-to-life depiction of what happened, that it's almost frightening. You won't want to look away.There are a few downsides however, one being the running time, either the movie was too dragged out or was just moving too slow. To me, I felt as though it could have ended fifteen minutes earlier. There's also a lot of partying, however, this being a depiction of a real life set of teenagers' lives, I can see why it was so vital towards the film. These kids have parents who do as much as they do. The parents don't care what happens to these kids, which makes it all the more terrifying. These kids are on their own. They have nowhere to run and no one to turn to for help.With an all-star cast, and top performances all around (not a fan of Justin Timberlake? You will be after this film. Trust me) this film is one not to be missed. The ending is so shocking, that it's a wonder I didn't expect it early on. 'Alpha Dog' is an emotional roller coaster that will have you glued to the screen right from the emotional opening credits.",Alpha Dog
102,luckyfoshizzle,wow so powerful,10,1 May 2007,"man, I almost passed this movie up, but after watching it I'm so glad I didn't. I always saw ads for it, but I just thought 'great! another stupid gangster movie with justin timberlake as a badass. I'll remember to never see this'. But then I saw many of my favorite actors in it and I decided to give it a shot.This movie just blows my mind. I mean, its just so real (not just because its based on actual events), but because for one the performances were just so strong. Some may say that it was a little over top on them trying to be badasses. But I know people that are exactly like that so I bought that completely.I watched the trailer and read up on the movie but never the actual events. I even heard somewhere that the kid does die, but watching the movie I just didn't buy it. I mean, I figured it'd be a grade A typical movie where regardless of how the real story ended this was going to be happy. The kid had it good, he loved it there. Even some of the kidnappers loved it there.This story is a sad story for everyone involved, though. These kids were just looking for a way out and they chose the worst way possible. I mean, how could they possibly think it was a good idea to help them get out of trouble by killing the kid? One of the reasons they couldn't just let him go in the first place is because his brother knew and would go looking for him and they worried the boy would tell. But killing was the worst idea for one killing is just horrible and for two all of these people have already seen them with him and they told them that he was kidnapped. How could this movie just not blow your mind because of that.I actually had tears in my eyes when they killed the kid. It was so unexpected. This is definitely a movie you should check out. The performances were so great that if I didn't know any better I would have thought I was actually watching a real life kidnapping and murder.

104,vitaly-tomilov,The most disturbing example of American injustice,1,23 May 2008,"Away from any possible artistic value, I found this movie to be most disturbing. I was in such shock when the movie ended, appalled by what American ""justice"" system has for anyone on the crossroad and worse still, brag about it on TV. For God's sake, they are just kids, lost, confused, they fell victims to being just so naturally stupid, because they are kids, they must be directed, reprimanded where appropriate, explained where and how and why their life may go wrong.And what do we see in this movie: One kid who saw this happening  9 years in prison, and one other gets death row.The main character kid who pulled one stupid act because he was so angry (rightfully) at his business partner ends up with life sentence, and so does another kid.But what's most appalling, was the saying in the movie that this kid once spooked and fled the country, was 5 years on the FBI's most wanted list. I mean, this just beats them all, the highest of the American hypocrisy that exists. While so many murders happen on every corner every day and every hour and nobody gives a damn about those people, one lost kid makes one stupid mistake to end up in jail for the rest of his life, and being placed on the list with Bin Laden and world threatening people alike I was so disturbed by this movie and blunt American injustice, I couldn't sleep for two nights, disgusted by Americans whose hypocrisy reached the sky, in praying God yet knowing nothing of forgiveness, nothing of understanding and patience; they are pitiful, bitter and blindly vicious to their own kind, unchristian lunatics worshiping hatred and prejudice.",Alpha Dog

I know it is the second week out, but it is better than what I can remember seeing last year. There is so much that is good about this film that it is hard to know where to begin. You can start with the characters. There is quite a range of socio-economic backgrounds converging here in comfortable laid back sleaziness, out of which comes the interaction of characters with a range of family values. There are the second and third generation sleazeballs played by Bruce Willis and Harry Dean Stanton. There are parents like the mother played by Sharon Stone who wants to raise happy healthy decent children. Kids who are essentially vicious and stupid hang with those who won't put common sense and decency in their back pockets and a mix of those in between. We see the initial corruption of the innocent as well as the easy descent of the aimless. This is not just another teen crime movie or the umpteenth hostage flick. It is also a story that is rife for reductionistic moralizing: my pre-emptive strike on one Jesus H. Christ. I don't what is responsible for the dumpage on this movie, but I think it will find the large audience it deserves.",Alpha Dog
106,b1lskirnir,Just because it's a true story doesn't mean it's a good one,3,13 November 2006,"I had a chance to catch this at the International House in Philadelphia and even had the luck of meeting the director/writer, Mr. Nick Cassavetes, afterward. He seemed like an intelligent man and had no difficulty answering the questions by the audience, particularly when I told him that I hated it and thought the film condoned the same sort of behavior it attempted at first to portray negatively. He thanked me for being honest and seemed like an intelligent man, whose views I will incorporate into this review.Before saying anything else: if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the entire movie, no exaggeration. Alpha Dog is more or less the story of a young boy Zach Mazursky caught up in the rich, white, gangster lifestyle of middle California in the late 90s. As a sort of ""ransom"" for rivaling parties, he is held hostage until his brother pays a debt of $2,500 to boss Johnny Truelove. However, he develops a bizarre case of Stockholm Syndrome and begins to identify with the lifestyle of his captors, not wanting to go home to his overprotective, Conservative family.From the beginning of the film, you may want to start counting f-bombs because this could seriously be a rival for the top 10, if not the top 25 most-used list. The film is filled with different sorts of flashy editing, particularly a lot of awkward split-screening for no particular reason other than to maintain the audience's interest. The dialogue feels extremely unnatural, even for kids who normally have no sense of English, a lot of the stereotypical screaming women are very over the top and many of the actors behave like they've never even been drunk or high, much less seen a real gangster, or even a poser gangster before (except perhaps Ben Foster and Sharon Stone, who both have at least one very competent scene).Mr. Cassavetes seemed to disagree with me, particularly with regards to Justin Timberlake. On that note, it is surprising that this is such a low-budget movie in light of his other works (The Notebook, John Q) and contains so many well-known actors. For achieving his artistic dream in the face of a small budget and little production sponsorship I will give him credit, but back to the movie itself.Early on we see a heavily exaggerated archetype of a rap music video that one might find on MTV or BET these days that is being viewed at a party. Everyone is drunk, high, and either having sex or wanting to, showing in a rather obvious, if not efforted fashion that the film disagrees with this lifestyle. Throughout the movie, the people at the screening who came for the free show laughed at the violence and the stupidity of some of the characters' dialogue, not because of irony, but because it seemed funny, almost normal. The message was not being made, especially in the very over-the-top scene where Zack gets in a swimming pool with two very attractive ladies who find it ""hot"" that he's been abducted.Practically the entire lifestyle away from Zach's overprotected parents is glorified in the babes, booze, and pot. On one very unexplained level, it attempts to say that this lifestyle is stupid and too many kids are leading it and it should be dealt with. On another, it's saying that this is a dream-come-true for Zach, a way for him to rebel and that this is a positive thing that he was abducted. Further on, in a situation I will not reveal, he suddenly comes to an almost laughable epiphany in the process of thanking his captors and stating how he should all of a sudden, ""be better to his mom"" because she's his ""best friend"" or do something productive like ""learn guitar."" This is a revelation you get from boozing it up and enjoying it!?What do I think? I think the movie needed a whole different viewpoint and marketing. The audience it is intended to reach will not understand anything except the futility of the real- life story itself. They will not understand, ""No, this is a stupid way for a person to live and this is what happens;"" they will merely find something comical to enjoy while the characters are wasted out of their skulls, condoning and laughing at it rather than being affected by it. There are far better movies that have presented these types of negative lifestyle's as-is (see Kids, Gummo, American History X, Trainspotting, Finding Forrester, etc.) as well as ones that have come off relatively preachy (On The Waterfront, Requiem For A Dream, Blow, Leaving Las Vegas, etc.) but still manage to have a consistent vision.Many audience members will be affected by the fact that this film is a true story. I am a firm believer in the fact that this should not change one's attitude toward its artistic quality. This film, while an interesting true story, needed to be manipulated as a work of fiction more. No matter the outcome, this is merely another tragic and stupid story of what happens with kids with too much free time and too much of their parents' money; had the main character not been on the FBI's Most Wanted list for 5 years or rather had the victim not been white, rich, and in a suburban setting, this story would've never caught anyone's attention. It is for this, among other reasons, that I find it to be a rather self-undoing movie, one whose purpose may at the core be divine and intelligent, but whose writing and overall execution was as nebulous as a train wreck.Mr. Cassavetes, you seem like an intelligent man, and I apologize for not enjoying your film.",Alpha Dog

I would say sad directing, but I don't know how much was his vision versus reality so I'll withhold judgment. Sad visual effects...the final scene was ridiculous. Bottom line - sad waste of 2 hours. *** SPOILER ALERT *** The crazy brother was totally unbelievable. Why was he trying to borrow money to pay off the guy if he was such a bad ass??? And the sister who shrieked constantly was probably the dumbest. If you know someone did something, just go to the police. DO NOT go to their house and warn them. None of their motivations made sense. I agree with the other reviewer. They must have been on much more than marijuana. Only complete idiots would think they'd get less time for murder than for kidnapping. And kidnapping would have been difficult to prove with him walking around freely. Apparently none of these kids watched CSI or any other medical examiner show in the past 20 years. Unfortunately, no one got any backbone until after the guy was killed. They all deserve the death penalty. Hopefully, this movie teaches people to avoid idiots otherwise it was a total waste of film.",Alpha Dog
108,Kate_Dammit_Run,Every Parents Worst Nightmare,8,24 September 2007,"Sonny Truelove, the father of one of the main characters, starts off the film by saying that this is about parenting. But it's really about the myths that we tell ourselves.Alpha Dog is based on the real life case of Jesse James Hollywood. In the film he's changed in Johnny Truelove, a middle class suburban drug dealer with his own little posse of acolytes. Johnny, who makes decent money and exists on the outskirts of the Southern California criminal underworld, thinks he's a badass. And therein lies the problem. When Johnny gets into an argument with a fellow drug dealer, a rage fueled neo-Nazi Jewish meth addict, played to perfection by Ben Foster, he kidnaps the mans brother for ransom and things spin out of control. It doesn't spoil the movie to reveal that they end up murdering the teenage boy.This is a film which is powerful in it's mundanity. One complaint that people had is that ""these guys aren't tough guys."" But that's the whole point. The film has a lot to say about the myths that we tell ourselves, about a culture which values bad boy status and celebrates criminality. The fact is that Truelove and his gang are NOT real tough guys. They are suburban kids who are playing at being tough, and that's where the trouble comes from. They don't understand the boundaries of violence and they get into trouble for it. There's two great performances in this film: one from Ben Foster, who is alternately loving and apocalyptic as a suburban meth addict, and from, yes, Justin Timberlake as Johnny Truelove's likable easy going right hand man.",Alpha Dog

112,mario10zeus,"Does it job slightly better than Havoc, Black & White and Kids.",7,14 October 2008,"Nick Cassavetes manages to helm a story about teenagers trying to act like adults with bad consequences. Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch) is a 20 year old suburban drug dealer (yes, such thing exists) working for his career criminal dad. After a run-in with psychotic Jewish neo-nazi Jake Mazursky (yes, that also exists, oddly enough), Johnny and friends kidnap Jake's kid brother Zach to force Jake to pay up a debt. The plot revolves around this kidnap.Hirsch has never really convinced me. I think he was miscast; his role should 've been played by a tougher actor, someone more menacing looking. I wouldn't think twice about knocking him out and jacking his stuff. Justin Timberlake is surprisingly a good actor. His character Frankie,is genuinely likable. Shawn Hatosy as usual, is typecast as a jerk. Ben Foster does a decent if highly histrionic job as Jake.As with any movie about decadent youth, drugs and sex are everywhere. The difference is that some of these kids seem too young or from too nice families (Keith, Zach, Amanda Seyfried). Parents are druggies too and are mostly absent except for Zach's. Everyone is tattooed and high. Still, the movie's likable because it doesn't over do it and try to be preachy, unlike Larry Clark's Kids.

114,ecko_47,"'Alpha Dog' Has bark, but little bite",4,13 January 2007,"Like Larry Clark's ""Kids"" and ""Bully,"" ""Alpha Dog"" takes inordinate pleasure in watching a cast of young actors indulge in trashy behavior for the sheer lurid thrill of it. It's got skill and craft and some good acting to recommend it. And it's based on a true story. But its soulless posturing and jaded cynicism are far more repellant than cool.The film is a retelling of the story of Jesse James Hollywood, one of the youngest people ever to appear on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list.In writer-director Nick Cassavetes' vision, Hollywood (renamed Johnny Truelove and played by Emile Hirsch from ""Lords of Dogtown"") is a craven punk who inherits his criminal tendencies from his father and grandfather (Bruce Willis and Harry Dean Stanton, respectively) and whose empire of drug dealing, violence and partying is built on the work and muscle of a circle of sycophants.Johnny is terrified, for instance, of Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster), a local hothead who owes him money but has no fear of him or his goons. After several violent confrontations, Johnny has the idea to get the dough by kidnapping Jake's younger brother (Anton Yelchin) and hiding him in the care of Johnny's second-in-command, Frankie (Justin Timberlake). But give a job like that to an idiot and, predictably, it's gonna go wrong.The material is plenty sensational, but unlike Clark, whose relish for voyeurism and exploitation result in harrowing viewing, Cassavetes has a strange ambivalence toward the nasty world he depicts. He likes showing the sex and drugs and fighting all right, but he uses distancing tactics such as scrambling time or labeling new characters with such tags as ""Witness #11"" or having a journalist interview the principals about their retrospective thoughts.His work with actors is similarly uneven: Hirsch, Timberlake (!) and the whiny Yelchin are good, but Foster is allowed to chew the scenery with heedless abandon, and Sharon Stone's performance as the kidnapped boy's mother varies from sympathetically strung-out to laughably self-indulgent. Had the film been more tempered in its textures, had Cassavetes chosen a surer attitude toward his subjects, it might have been devastating. As it stands, though, it's far more showy than substantial.",Alpha Dog

119,Rooster9,Sharon Stone in a fat suit? Oh no.,3,11 January 2007,"Alpha Dog has its moments. And those are the moments when the actors get to sit around and act like themselves -- Young Hollywood chums, smoking, talking s**t, and partying. But beyond those moments, no one seems to know what Alpha Dog is about. And that includes writer/director Nick Cassavetes (son of actor/director John Cassavetes). With a cast and crew populated by Young Hollywood pretty boys and girls, Alpha Dog often seems more like a vanity project than a focused story. Of course, there's nothing Hollywood loves more than bemoaning the tragedy of a privileged elite who rebel, often with tragic results, against their own privilege. And Alpha Dog tries to capture that tragedy. But portraying a smoke-filled party with a group of flawed bad asses does not a tragedy make. Like another self-absorbed popularity project, the comedy ""Orange County"" -- directed by Jake Kasdan (son of writer/director Lawrence Kasden) -- you can almost see the film's young stars sitting around their coffee table in a haze of pot smoke, congratulating each other for the cleverness of their newest party project.But with an aimless plot, fight scenes choreographed like a martial arts extravaganza and a pointless third act featuring Sharon Stone in a fat suit (surely the film's most flawed attempt at drama), ""Alpha Dog"" reads like a wanna-be ""Bully."" If you haven't seen Larry Clark's ""Bully,"" then you SHOULD RENT IT TODAY. It's a tense, all-too-real depiction of bored suburban kids who have nothing better to do than punish the most privileged boy in town. Interestingly, both ""Alpha Dog"" and ""Bully"" star Brad Renfro as the gay-baited pushover who ends up snapping. That casting decision should have been a clue to the filmmakers: They're trying to capture the essence of a much better film.That said, if you must see ""Alpha Dog,"" I would recommend leaving the theater after the climactic scene in the Palm Springs Desert when Justin Timberlake showcases his acting chops in a fine dramatic moment. The following twenty minutes are strangely unnecessary. And, out of curiosity, what happened to Ben Foster's character?

Johnny Truelove snaps at Mazursky causing a bitter, ferocious hatred to build up in Jake. Jake constantly hunts Truelove down like a dog and shouts very loud down the phone, causing Truelove to leg it at the end to avoid arrest and being killed by Jake, who, in his words definitely intended that.

127,icgsinc,superb portrayal of adolescent poly-drug addicts,7,25 June 2009,"One critic described ""Alpha Dog,"" Nick Cassavetes' thinly disguised story of the murder of 15-year-old Nicholas Markowitz for which Jesse James Hollywood is on trial, as a ""glossy yet unflinching portrait of violent, hedonistic teenagers."" Johnny Truelove's (Jesse James Hollywood's) chain-smoking father Sonny (played by Bruce Willis) suggested ""it's all about parenting,"" which is what Cassavetes suggested in several interviews. These are typical takes on a film that is, at its core, really about adolescent poly-drug addiction.The film is, at first, very difficult to watch. It's filled to the brim with profanities, tattoos, boozing, drugging, violence, screaming, reckless driving and addicts' confabulations. In other words, it accurately portrays the behaviors of adolescent polydrug addicts.The codependent (and probably alcoholic) parents are crazed, yet continue to enable. The older son, Jake Mazursky (Ben Markowitz in real life, played by Ben Foster), is the most vile out-of-control methamphetamine addict we've seen since ""Salton Sea"" (starring the great Vincent D'Onofrio). But the story mellows a bit, particularly as we get to know the younger Zack Mazursky (victim-in-real-life Nicholas Markowitz, played by a wonderful Anton Yelchin), who becomes complicit in naïve fashion in his own abduction. Zack is too endearing and cute to be savagely murdered, even if he seems quite happy to have a taste of the addicts' decadent lifestyles in the largely party-like atmosphere. (Although he seems to regard his older brother with, as one critic put it, both admiration and envy, the film makes it appear that this was his only foray into drug use. I have it on good authority that he was already a dope-smoking, pill-taking several-times runaway, so we can assume the movie took some literary license to tone down the dramatic effect, thereby making it more palatable for the rest of us.) The bond that develops between Zack and Frankie (one of Truelove's addict friends, played by a surprisingly good Justin Timberlake) also helps to tone the movie down just enough for this reviewer to be able to give it an almost eight stars out of ten (so I feel compelled here to give it seven).But it's not about lousy parenting, even if non-addicted parents might intervene before tragedy happens. Nor is it, as another critic said, heavy-panting exploitation of the crime, since reporting the tragic results of addiction help to protect the rest of us, if only we would learn. Another critic suggested that Cassavetes' suggestion that it's about lousy parenting is ""rot,"" instead claiming it's about ""the pleasure of watching beautiful bodies at rest and in motion. It's about the allure of youth, the erotics of violence and the inevitable comeuppance that must always be meted out whenever youth strays too far from the fold."" As he put it, what rot. The sober among us do not think it alluring or erotic. It's about the tragedies that can occur when addiction isn't properly dealt with. The comeuppance all-too-often comes too late.",Alpha Dog
128,selfedluke,A potential gem tainted by bad directing,4,29 December 2020,"I grew up in West Hills, the actual suburb this took place in (not the central California valley they filmed it in for legal reasons) and was looking forward to a good film about the families I've heard of here.The movie is kinda a mess. At first, we're led on to believe the story will be about how otherwise decent kids get turned into violent, abrasive, and drug addled teens (the baby videos of all the main cast in the intro clearly depicts this). The film is clearly meant to be more of a collage style expose of the many people involved in the events rather than a straight story centered on a few key characters. Totally fine concept, but it did it this very poorly.Cassevets showed us what feels like a 2 hour montage of annoying and unlikeable teens walking in and out of over-the top swearing contests, gang style partying, and some occasional good scenes where we learn about them or what drives them (mainly with Yelchin's portrayal of the murdered kid).The only believable performance in this movie comes from Anton Yelchin, who's excellent at winning our empathy and understanding as a doe-eyed innocent teen trying to get girls and be liked. Timberlake is quite good in the last 20ish minutes when he drops the laughably fake-gangster attitude as well. But Emile Hirsch, the lead, was either terribly cast or terribly written for the part of Jesse James- we learn almost nothing about him and every moment he takes up on screen is just him screaming dumb obscenities and intimidating his friends and girlfriends with violence. And why on earth wasn't Bruce Willis given more screen time? His character was Jesse's father, drug supplier, and conspirator who helped him escape to Brazil.. ie a MAJOR character in this story.The editing in this movie- something I usually don't notice unless it's incredible or terrible-- is BAD. It went for a style trying to copy 90s MTV, but did so poorly and without purpose or good sense. Random split-screens happen in scenes where it is totally unnecessary, like when four people are sitting on the same couch. It also constantly throws captions at us about minor characters and scene locations that aren't needed. But worst are the poorly weaved together scenes that don't logically follow on another (flash forward interviews with victims literally feel randomly inserted after live action scenes, and these last like 30 seconds)It's 4 stars though because I'll admit being thrilled in a few scenes, specifically when the junkie first starts causing trouble and the ending of the movie when Timberlake tries to figure out how he'll navigate the murder. There are some gems here.",Alpha Dog

I saw a program on the true story behind Alpha Dog and it is so close to the real story. I have never seen a movie(based on a true story) That is so close to the real thing. I am very impressed. I would recommend this to anyone liking Dramas and action films or a combination of the two. It obviously is not as action packed as some of the films but it does have very action packed parts. Definitely 10 out of 10 stars for me. The only thing I could say is they could cut down on the swearing. But as it gets further in the movie it does mellow down.Kris",Alpha Dog
130,gav_mcf,Gripping saga with excellent performances.,8,11 July 2009,"For those who don't know much about Alpha Dog, it is a Los Angeles set crime drama based on a true story. The plot is pretty simple, Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster) owes drug money to Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch) and his crew, so they kidnap Jake's brother Zach (Anton Yelchin) until he pays up. But as it gets deeper Johnny realises the trouble he's in and will take drastic measures to cover up his mistakes...With Alpha Dog, director Nick Cassavetes is covering a very interesting story, based on Jesse James Hollywood, here called Johnny Truelove (the youngest man ever to be on the FBI's most wanted list). The question is: would it carry over well into a Hollywood movie? The answer is, thanks to the performances and easy story telling, yes.Most of the actors put in very solid performances which makes you care about the story much more. Emile Hirsch is predictably excellent as head man Truelove, getting into more trouble as the film goes on and Hirsch brilliantly shows the panic that the character faces so early in his youth. Also great are Shawn Hatosy as Truelove's right hand man Elvis Schmidt, Anton Yelchin as the kidnapped Zach but the standout is Justin Timberlake as Frankie who is charismatic and very effective in another performance that leads to panic and indecision which he does very well. However, the usually very good Ben Foster as Jake seems to totally overact and shout as much as he can. Bruce Willis doesn't have too much to do as Johnny's dad Sonny but is good to watch as always. There's not many female roles, Sharon Stone is OK as Zach's mum and sexy Mean Girls star Amanda Seyfried is good as one of the crew's party girls.Another aspect thats effective in Alpha Dog is the storytelling, it doesn't try to pack in too much and just stays easy, relaxing and natural. It could have easily taken the Domino route and just been an overblown event of wild set pieces, but fortunately it has a very much real life feel. It's also got a neat visual effect counting witnesses as it goes along, which also helps you keep track of everyone that seen the horrible mistake these guys made.Of course the main story in all this is the tragic kidnapping of Zach Mazursky, which actually turns out to be a lot different than you think. Zach actually enjoys hanging out with these guys and is having the time of his life away from his parents, which makes the decision of what to do so much more difficult for the crew. With this story at the centre of attention, there is a lot of pressure on Anton Yelchin, but the Star Trek and Terminator 4 star delivers very well and you can't help but engage in the confused teenager as the story goes on.Minor gripes about Alpha Dog are that the film runs a little bit too long for the amount of story it covers and the pointless party scenes take the focus away from the story a bit. Other than that Alpha Dog is a gripping, sometimes heart-felt drama worth checking out for the excellent performances of Hirsch, Timberlake, Hatosy and Yelchin.",Alpha Dog

To say it had ""foul"" language would be a joke. The sex scenes were beyond the word of distasteful. The amount of violence was appalling. I would say that I drew the line at one scene, in particular, when one teenager, in an enemy house, decides to behave like an house pet who hasn't been housebroken.I won't waste anymore of my time writing about this film.

So when my wife rent this movie, I was already with a ""let's see what is this Trash about"" kinda look on my face. I was ready to tear it apart, and at the beginning the way of acting of Justin made me just want to do it; (it almost made me throw up)... and I deeply think that was the best atmosphere that a Director can give to this kind of films... WHY ??? Simple... the first 10mins kill all your hopes of watching something good and prepares you to see another garbage Film... but then it just like an Avalanche !!! ... Man!!! it's a ""Truelove"" what I feel for this Film ... it becomes so intense that you don't even close your eyes for a second, you forget about your Popcorn completely; and the suspense it just as subtle as extreme! and its Heart-Braking-Drama Parts.. well I muss say it was something i was not ready for.Even the roll that Justin played. When the movie started he just looked like another wanna-be Actor and at the end his performance increase on a miracle way should I say...All this unexpectedness it's what makes this Piece so special. I mean let's be real, who will expect that in a Film with Bruce Willis and Justin together, about drugs, Teenagers and L.A. could be ever Good ???

This movie encourages losers in real life that smoke,sell and grow dope to resort to violence if a buyer or friend owes them money or someone reports them ( too good for the dope sellers) and I'm sure this is their favourite pathetic movie cause all they do is grow and sell dope and stay on the dole (government payments).Just like the idiots on this movie, and this is encouraging them to get into more drugs not to mention violence.

After the film I checked up on it over the internet, and I wish I'd done that before so that I could have been prepared. There is a brutal moment that I didn't expect and made me feel ill. I have been called a big wimp by many a girl however, so take that advice with a pinch of salt.The film is generally well acted, you've got to allow for Timberlake not being an actor by trade. But the cast support each other well and make for good watching. The story is quite simple, but it's better that way rather than speculating on lots of details. There are moments which have, I think, been thrown in with poetic license. Which is fair enough, you can't make a movie on facts alone. It's a lovely looking movie, nicely shot.

I guess there was a serious message in this film... something along the lines of innocence lost, but the only message I received was that there are certain parts of California that we need to nuke immediately. If these kids are reproducing, we're in trouble! Let me get this straight: Justin Timberlake's character lives rent-free in an awesome mansion, never has to work, gets laid everyday by some new hot drunk blonde, yet he gladly wants to throw it all away in the name of badly thought out gangsta murder plots to please a guy who sells a few ounces of marijuana?

136,njscreenwriter,"Great Cast, good film.",7,5 May 2009,"Just watched this the night before I'm writing this and I have to say I enjoyed the film, but felt it was too long.This is an excellent example of how stupid kids get caught up in a lifestyle they don't know and don't understand. Watching the white, suburbanite gangster wannabe attitudes made the characters get on my nerves. Especially when you see what kind of environments they grew up in yet they still lived the way they did. It seemed to me these kids had a choice. All I could keep saying to myself throughout the movie was that these kids were really stupid. The only exception is Emile Hirshs' character. Obviously the other characters followed his lead, and he knew how to manipulate them. They did his dirty work and paid the price, so it was extremely gratifying to see in the end that he is paying his dues.I thought there were some great performances - Emile Hirsch is always a standout, Anton Yelchin was great, and Ben Foster was very intense. His performance was unnerving! I thought JT was good, not great. I didn't feel like his character was much of a stretch - it was a fairly stereotypical character. JT has talent, and this was a good starting out role. I'm sure he'll get better with time. The rest of the supporting cast was fine. Although I still don't think Sharon Stone is a good actress.The movie dragged on a bit with all the partying. The exposition was provided early on and they did a good job developing the relationship with Zach as the movie went on, but I felt like overall the movie was about 20-25 minutes too long. All in all, a tragic story about dumb kids getting in way over their heads and the horrible price they paid for their actions.",Alpha Dog

140,ShotgunHemingway,Alpha Dog Has Teeth,7,14 January 2007,"The film, which closed out the 2006 Sundance film festival, is based on the true story of twentysomething drug dealer Jesse James Hollywood and a kidnapping that goes sour. After a deadbeat (Jake Mazursky - played by Ben Foster) doesn't pay up, drug dealer Johnny Truelove (Hirsch) attempts to ""rough him up"". However, he falls short in getting his message across and Mazursky retaliates by later breaking into Truelove's home. In the escalating cycle, Truelove kidnaps Mazursky's brother and that's where the story really takes off. Featuring powerful performances by Sharron Stone and Ben Foster (and a surprisingly solid one from Justin Timberlake), I found the movie to be a pretty fun ride and a well-done indictment of the selfish mentality that befalls a generation of kids with too much money and time on their hands that watch too much MTV.The biggest qualm the critics seem to have is how exploitive the film is, with its rampant drug use and t'n'a, even calling the film an ""LA Exploitation Film"".

It's a shame, since all the elements are there to make a great film - cameos from some big name actors, the tension between the two main characters, a bevy of beautiful young actresses, the kidnap, and the eventual descent into madness from which there is no return. The story itself is compelling in and of itself, and by its very nature has a lot of potential. A few snips here and there in the editing stage would have made this film what it could have been. That and more screen time for the beguiling Amanda Seyfried, who should be in a lot more movies with a minimal amount of clothing. The film would also have benefited from an expansion of a love story between Zack and Julie (Amanda Seyfried), making his murder that much more tragic.The Pros: General storyline, Amanda Seyfried, Justin Timberlake - proving again he has serious acting chops, Sharon Stone - I bought her in the mother role, although the fat makeup strained credulity.The Cons: Pacing, the labeling of each of the extra characters as ""Witness #_"" didn't necessarily have a payoff.",Alpha Dog

I hate kids who are spoiled and treat themselves and others the way that was displayed in this movie - though this is a good movie, don't get me wrong. It's just that, if it wasn't a true story, it would have sucked. I mean, it is one of the stories that if: ""It was true, I wouldn't believe it"" This movie did however have a severe plot hole because the law states that if you hold someone for ransom then you can receive up to life in prison. However, they didn't even offer up the ransom to the family. Johnny Truelove didn't even offer what ransom he wanted from the guy, so how could this be a ransom case??? I don't know if this was a plot hole or if that is exactly what happened in real life...Here is where there inexperience came into account. NOBODY new it was a ransom case, hell, the parents didn't even know he was kidnapped. All they had to do, was spill the whole story out to the kid and then send him home...and tell him to keep a secret, it is that simple. They could have easily got him to come over to their side. But no, they thought they were going to be ""bad ass adults"" about the thing and handle it the ""gangster"" way....it was ridiculous; and it just showed how inexperienced they were afterward when they were arrested and how they were turned back into little kids all over again, which is what they were, they never grew up. I mean, they were only like four years older than the kid they kidnapped, that is not much. All they had to do was drop the kid off and go back to dealing with his brother again, simple.In any case, this is one of the movies that has great acting and displays the ignorance of the inexperienced in a very accurate way.

I don't even care to discuss this film. I would brush it off as just another trite Hollywood bowel movement if I was not aware of who directed it. Yes, the seed of the loins of one of the greatest directors OF ALL TIME directed this. The great director is John Cassavetes. The seed of the loins is his son Nick. John Cassavetes made Husbands, Opening Night, The Killing of a Chinese Bookie, A Woman Under the Influence. The great actor. The great director. Johnny Staccato. Old school hard core John Cassavetes. The man had more integrity than a thousand other filmmakers combined. Rather than impregnating Gena Rowlands with the seed that would become Nick Cassavetes, rather than conceiving this wretched child that night, John should have just busted one out into his gym sock and went to sleep. That miserable little sperm would grow up to direct such heinous garbage as Alpha Dog, The Notebook, My Sister's Keeper. Gena Rowlands must be horrified by the schlock that her son is churning out. If only Little Nicky had not been injured in his foray into a career in sports perhaps he would not have fallen back into making films. Put the camera down, dude. Go play some more poker. His father surely would have beat hell out of him for making this film. Can you imagine John Cassavetes, Ben Gazzara, and Timothy Carey sitting around watching My Sister's Keeper? Or Alpha Dog?

I have never been a Justin Timberlake fan, but he was one of the best things about this movie. You cannot dislike him in this. He does a good job of showing us the moral dilemma he is twisting in. I always love Emile Hirsch but found this character a little one dimensional. Gone were the moments where you can see everything he thinks and feels on his face as when he portrays Z-boy Jay Adams or as Tim Travis in ""Imaginary Heroes."" He is supposed to be the heartless bad guy in this and since he is portraying a real person perhaps the flatness of this character is due to an accurate depiction of real life Jesse James Hollywood. What this character lacks in emotion, others, such as ""Susan"" and ""Keith,"" give us a bit more to watch. Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone are believable most of the time, but some moments feel incongruent (Stones final scene for example was over the top and in such a bad way). Likewise Ben Foster's Jake Mazursky is all over the place as a strung out-stressed out loser that starts the whole mess. He has moments of brilliance but otherwise he's just too much. The movie is way too long and tries to focus on every player in this truly tragic story. I would have liked more of Anton Yelchin's Zach and more of the emotional battles of the key characters and far less of the get high and blast out violent rap while insulting our sex partners in front of the whole gang.

Unfortunately you're not left with the feeling that anyone was genuinely that bothered, and you don't really care very much.Does that mean i'm emotionally stunted? I dunnoJustin 'cry me a river' Timberlake took to his street talking, weed smoking white rapper wannabe character rather too well. Possibly the most unconvincing,comic use of slang since 'Harsh times' this 'rich kids do the hood' was at times condescending (as well as hilarious, without meaning to be). Snake trousers (bless him) walks around almost parodying himself throughout, was his character even necessary? The party scenes were the ultimate travesty-exaggerated, over-done, and unlike 'Kids' or 'Bully' (which may i point out were a much more convincing portrayal of dysfunctional youths),these particular teens seem too far-fetched and stylised to be realistic.I guess the only thing i could say about this film which is positive (because they didn't make it easy for me)is the fact that its a different take on influential American society. The adults portrayed seemed either too caught up with their children (a la Sharon stone), or not caring at all (timberlake's dad), this is refreshing in comparison to 'OC' style representations.Other then that, buy it on DVD, and give it to your 16 year old cousin who wears 50 cent hoodies.

It really saves it. The acting of Yelchin in that scene is the main reason why I'm reviewing this film, so that anyone who starts watching sticks up to the end because it's really worth it. Believe me, it really does get better, even GOOD, I dare say. That's why I give it a 7/10.",Alpha Dog
153,xxstaindrosesxx,Alpha Dog,6,28 January 2007,"This movie is very short of being great. Once you get past all the swearing, drinking, and drug use, the story is actually kind of interesting but not that great. I'm a Justin Timberlake fan and I thought his acting performance was nothing great. He was good as his character but I feel as if the acting performance didn't really give a chance to see his full potential as an upcoming actor. One of the best performances was by Ben Foster who played the brother of kid who is the main character. I thought his performance stood out the most in the whole movie. Otherwise, this movie was mediocre. It could of been better and a lot of the acting was very lame. Also, I understand that the main point of the story is about choices, but bad things happen to people all the time and of all stories, they choose to make this one into a movie. I'm sure there are other stories out there that are more deserving than this one and it is probably why this movie suffers with crappy actors and a boring storyline.",Alpha Dog

155,LeonardMaltinsBalls,not sure who the ideal audience is for this film,7,14 January 2007,"Short and sweet, this movie is about a ""gang"" (that actually just consists of rich white boys in California who bank on selling weed), and the people who owe them money. They kidnap a 15 year old played by Anton Yeltchen (who, in the movie, is the brother of Ben Foster, who owes them $1,200), only Anton is glad to be kidnapped cause he resents his over-bearing parents, and gets a glimpse into this anything-goes, 24-hours-a-day-party-scene of the rich and responsibility-free youth of the west coast. Then during the last few minutes of the movie you see these guys facing the consequences of what they've done.All in all, I went to see this because it's John Cassevetes' son who made it. I am fairly neutral on Justin Timberlake, or was prior to seeing this. IF NOTHING ELSE this movie is worth seeing for the performances. Seriously, Emile Hirsch, Justin Timberlake, Ben Foster, and most of the other guys are SO good. Bruce Willis is awesome too. If nothing else, Nick Cassavetes, although definitely going in a different direction than his father did, is allowing his characters to become who they are playing. The acting is very real. So at least that runs in the family. The actual story telling is questionable, and pretty Luke-warm. I wasn't expecting much, but was very pleased when the suspense in the last hour of the film was making me very anxious. That rarely happens.The style of the film was an unbalanced mix of faux documentary/re-enactment and hand held, crime drama stuff, with a mix of verity testimonials (but so few that it was just awkward). If he had committed to any of the above it would have been a lot less mushy. Also, there wasn't quite enough spoon-feeding to please the high schoolers sneaking in to see justin timberlake, and not quite enough realism to please a fan of his father.It sure was better than the Notebook.",Alpha Dog

No nonsense film in which the plot takes time to set in. But once the stage is set, there is no stopping the wild ride. You dunno whats happening next. There are some great scenes in this film which are visually very very appealing. There is one scene in which Johnny is calling Jake to talk bout his brother, they show the conversation in spilt screen. One one side u see jake hollering like a psycho and on the other side u see Johnny cool as a cucumber....two contrasting states of expression. However eventually one realises that its johnny who is a nervous wreck. Then the climax...when Frankie and Elvis take jake's brother in the car....i din expect what i would be witnessing the following few moments...I am not spoiling the suspense for you lots...all I wanna say is if u wanna see a young, fresh, gangster film with sarcastic and slapstick humour, bundled with a kick arse attitude, please dun miss this one...lest u will regret it.cheers and happy viewing.",Alpha Dog
158,PhoenixRising1980,Surprisingly good,9,5 February 2006,"I got a chance to see a screening of this at Sundance.This movie sucks you in, seduces you, entrances you, then whacks you over the head with a baseball bat.It starts off fairly annoying... bunch of pimply-faced white wanna-be's spouting rapid fire ghetto speak with rap music blaring in the background. Eminem would be proud. I thought to myself, ""oh no, here we go to one dimensional city..."".But after a while these characters became very likable. These are REAL characters, living a really dangerous life style. The effect is similar in Goodfellas... they're so bad, so annoying, but fascinating, and free in ways ordinary people aren't. They do what they want, when they want and give you a bloody nose if you try and stop them.There's a mood, an energy, a style that Cassavettes was able to capture and portray that made this film so far removed from any clichéd studio product geared toward teenyboppers. The film feels honest and genuine, and that's the difference.At a certain point, after all the partying, and boozing and drugging, the film takes a turn for the worse and climaxes into a gut wrenching, horrible tragedy that left me (and the audience) stunned.Overall it's an extremely well crafted film, definitely worth seeing.And I almost forgot to mention the biggest surprise of all... Justin Timberlake. Forget what you know, forget N'SYNC, this guy is a real actor. I almost feel strange saying this, but it's true... He was stunning, almost stole the movie; crackled whenever he was on screen. He has all the right ingredients for a stellar acting career; charisma, screen presence, that separates him from the pretty faced phonies clogging the movie screens. Every moment he was on screen he was doing something that worked, and he makes it look easy, the most important trait a great actor has. I'll definitely be watching his acting career very closely from now on.",Alpha Dog

Its extremely well directed and most of the actors are brilliant (a few are a bit cringe worthy).I give credit where credits due this story builds up right from the start and just keeps you gripped.

So Amber and Jenna are taking him tomorrow(1/27/07)I believe to go see it, so they'll be seeing it a second time, and him once. It's actually the kind of movie I would not mind seeing again myself. I well definitely be getting it on DVD when it comes out.

163,cmwilliams1964,"Based on real life events, an excellent depiction of drug gang life.",9,10 April 2007,"When I first heard about this film it was from my wife and daughter and they raved because Justin Timberlake was in it. My first reaction was no way do I want to see it, however upon hearing it was based on the case of Jesse James Hollywood, whose story I had read some 6 month earlier, I became intrigued. Too many times before have films based on real events been lost to the directors' willingness to glamorise the scenes or overplay certain aspects of the story and miss the overall point. Alpha Dog, however, is a noticeable exception, yes there is a lot of cussing in it, yes there is violence, some quite extreme, but hey get real, thats what drug fuelled gangs are like. That what happens when drug deals go shy and people get ripped off. This film depicts the events quite close to the dramatised story I have read. I found it fascinating, warming in places, cruel in others and the end play is just superb (I don't want to spoil it by saying any more). Suffice to say Mr Timberlake surprised me with an excellent portrayal as did Emile Hersch and Ben Foster, and look out for Sharon Stone's piece at the end, heart rendering and brilliantly portrayed. I would strongly recommend this film to anyone who likes this genre, in places it reminded me of American HistoryX, in others of 8 Mile.

Then we have Justin Timberlake. Some white guy trying to be a Gangster - it is not working at all.The whole plot, the actors, the camera, the music was stupid.I had to watch the movie in German and there it was not even well dubbed so that did the shot to the head.I still don't get it: Why has one ""Gangster"" (a Nazi - why by the way?) to put his dump on another's floor? The dialogs were boring and there was no character development in it except for ""Elvis"" why - by the way - was still lame as everyone else.The only shocking moment in ""Alpha Dog"" was not even prepared. It happened and it was over as fast as it came.I understood, that ""Alpha Dog"" is based on a true story, but then it was still as bad as said. ""Blow"" and several other movies showed, that actual happened stuff can be performed a lot better.So please save your money and do /not/ go to see that movie!",Alpha Dog

But the end result was over-rated garbage. I can't believe that this is the movie that folks advertised as the bust out acting role for Justin Timberlake. I enjoyed ""Edison Force"" way more.

I felt for the kid and he had a good character arc. Sharon Stone really can't act...and overacts. Her in the fat suit at the end was funny to see though but that whole scene had nothing to do with the story either. To spend 6 minutes on her after her boy is killed is worthless when all we want to know is what happened to Frankie and the others. Not only that, she only had like ten lines before that point---pointless. Bruce Willis character was an engma at best. was he Mafia, was he just a hard ass with connections...who the F knows? Justin Timberlake as Frankie picked up steam as the movie went o. It was almost like he hired an acting coach after the first 30 minutes. I must admit-- he did a decent job.My overall opinion of this movie is very low. The director should be exiled from making movies. The only thing holding this movie together was some of the acting and naked chicks. This movie just goes to show that movies can be made and have been made for absolutely no reason. Lastly, who cares about the youngest man to ever be on the FBI's most wanted list. He wasn't even that bad of a man. He just made one bad choice.CRAP.",Alpha Dog

There were other good cameos from the likes of Willis and Stone, who also played convincing roles. Based loosely on a true story the film does move on quite well making you want to watch it all the way through. Displaying the lives of rich kids in America dabbling in drugs until, you guessed it, everything spirals out of control. For me where the film slightly looses it's edge is when you realise there all hopped up on cannabis but they are acting like they are on harder substances such as amphetamine or crack cocaine. The director obviously asked them to act as crazy and demented as they possibly could and it made it feel a little silly and clichéd to me. On the whole worth watching once but not one to buy for the DVD collection.",Alpha Dog

I wasn't very sure what I was getting myself into with this film. But if you went through the same thought process as I did when you saw this sitting on the shelf at the video store, or on a poster at a theatre, take all those expectations and throw them away. This film took me by surprise.This film is very down to earth. No flashy action sequences, car chases, big guns, or intricate CG effects. Just teenagers, parents, and people, in the midst of an escalating situation. For most of the rising action of the plot, I didn't think there was a clear cut bad guy or good guy, and I grew to like certain characters for certain traits, on both ends of the spectrum.All the actors (Yes, even Justin Timberlake) put on superb performances and this is one of the first films in a while that successfully grabbed me, and took me through a medley of emotions that the characters were experiencing.

The late Anton Yelchin character is the true heart of the story, and he did a fine job considering the horrendous script he was forced to work with. He's what the 1 Star is for... Bruce Willis looks like he doesn't want to be there, and is only there to collect a check. Sharon Stone as the mom in a fat-suit acting outrageously hysterical and over-the-top near the end of the film had me laughing out loud! Unfortunately, that scene was supposed to be highly dramatic, so it totally missed the mark. Justin Timberlake was and still is not an actor; most scenes calling for genuine emotion from his character were quite unconvincing, and again had me chuckling! The movie is honestly hilarious. It's just that bad.

This movie has a little bit of everything, i even shed one or 2 tears during an emotional scene between Frankee (Justin Timberlake) and the kid who gets taken.

The same goes for his partners, just really bad casting. The story itself is pretty unrealistic, there's no moral, sensation or humor the only thing it has is drama. Also the main characters are immensely brainless and that doesn't really help to sympathize or in any other way get into the movie. The movie is basically about a group of people that make really stupid decisions. It's built around the plot which I thought was comparable to a small 'poof' after lighting a big firecracker.

Too bad he's not in more of the movie. For the rest of them, the acting and the action was nothing short of laughable. The story follows an incompetent spur-of-the-moment kidnapping that the characters *acknowledge* is a bad idea from the start, yet they go through with it anyway.

Not only was the acting very real and well casted this is one of the few movies where I really connected with the characters. I felt for Zach, as well as Frankie, and even Keith.Having lived in Santa Barbara county for most of my preteen years and teen aged years I heard a lot about this story. I found that what they placed into the movie was very factual and spot on. Minus a few details such as the threesome scene but that was just for the Hollywood effect.Many people claimed this movie to be low budget which I find to be funny considering where did this movie lack in any department where you would find money to be the issue. They shot almost every scene on location, and there were no needs for special effects for anything in this movie.I thought the interview parts of movie also added to the story especially with heartfelt final interview of Zach(Nick's) mom Susan portrayed by Sharon Stone. Yeah the fat suit may have looked weird but damn did that scene send shivers down my bones. She was deeply impacted by the loss of her son and how she acted in that scene definitely captured it.Anton Yelchin is gonna go far after movies like this and Terminator Salvation. Props to him.

It's pure botch and annoyed me to the point that I almost left the cinema halfway trough if not for the person who was with me. It was truly painful to watch!I don't even know where to start but the worst part is definitely the laughable dialogue, adding an almost comic like ""quality"" to this crap flick. There is a scene where Timberlake urges a distressed Dominique Swain (?) to repeat something like ""I've got everything under control"" which had me laugh out loud. Or when Swain shouts ""This shirt is cool, Bob Marley is cool but kidnapping isn't cool"" it made me cringe in my seat! There's plenty of ""fuck"", ""Faggot"", ""bitch"", almost every other sentence included the F-word; it added up and went on my nerves. The movie lacks direction and the cut seems often random and unmotivated. It is obvious that Nick Cassavetes took here the same approach as his father did in many of his Indie productions and gave the actors much room for improvisations which resulted in them screaming, pushing, cursing and fighting each other till you get a headache. The story is totally predictable, there's lots of bad acting (Heather Wahlquist was surprisingly good and funny though) and even accomplished actors like Harry Dean Stanton or Sharon Stone couldn't save this mess. Especially Foster really overdid his role most of the time. The soundtrack fits the story of a bunch of teen wannabee gangstas well.Alpha Dog reminded me of Larry Clark's ""Bully"" only that the latter is still a much better movie despite Clark's manipulative and hypocritical exploitation of his protagonists and his playing the shock card about the oh so disturbing state of the nation's youth. But I prefer to watch a couple of totally unmotivated full frontals and zooming in on teen crotches/asses embedded in MTV-aesthetics over having to sit trough lines that had me wince in pain!Only way I can explain the surprisingly good IMDb rating is loads of Timberlake groupies pushing the 10 vote button.",Alpha Dog
179,GardenStateFan,Starts off so well - but the ending ruins the whole thing...,4,23 February 2009,"Alpha Dog is two films:The first is a well-executed opening 90 minutes, establishing intriguing characters and interesting problems/situations. The second film is the final 20 minutes. It is an amateurish, awkward and unsatisfying 'finale' that looks as though it was handled by a bunch of 18-year-old film school students who couldn't wrap their heads around effects. This is tragic since the performances were so good.I'm not usually one to let effects drag down a film, but when you can still practically see halos around the actors caused by a green screen it's extremely difficult to take the finale of the film as anything but a joke. If this is the first review you have read on the film, I do encourage you to watch it and try to get around the finale. It seems like a lot of people manage to do so as the IMDb score is quite high. Personally I do not regret seeing this movie, in fact there are a lot of great moments and well executed beats that will satisfy you.

The more the film went on I kept telling myself it would get better and sat it out but it never did. I realise it's a true story so it has to be a certain way, but they could have cast it better and made the character relationships more believable.

This is one of the better thought provoking stories based on actual events. It's about bad parenting, and a balance between right and wrong. These kids grew up together like so many young people today in communities across the country, and they take on extra activities as they grow older to be with the in crowd. It's about being cool, or at least feeling like you are. They try to act tough but easily fall flat once their bones are being picked. They scurry like little puppy dogs. Their spoiled childhood desires lead them into territory only the big dogs should be handling. They fail miserably at coming up with a good plan, and in the end wind up where all misguided dogs go the pound. It's moralistic value may inspire young people to think differently before they act. Having these young actors will hopefully bring about the truth parents often tend to neglect when dealing with their children.

So I'll address both of those issues.If you can look past whatever stereotype you have of Justin Timberlake, you'll really enjoy his character. Sure, it's hard to picture him as a tough guy and no, I don't think he's a superb actor. But he brings his character across, and well. I really suggest trying to get past the fact of who he is and go see the movie.Number 2, the trailer. I saw the trailer, and I still went. And in response to another person's comment ""you've seen it all if you've seen the trailer."" I can definitely say that is not the case. The end of this movie completely surprised me, and no trailer prepared me for that.Overall, the movie starts off a bit slow and you kind of wonder what will happen. Then it picks up and doesn't stop.Sure there are drugs and violence and sex and everything. And if you're not a person who has ever done any of the above or wanted to ever, in that case I guess I would say not to see it. How many movies out there are full of sex and violence and cursing? People can't really find a legitimate reason this movie is bad, so they blame it on that stuff. It's a movie. A movie that happens to do with drugs.

It's inspired by true story and author might tried to tell us: ""don't kill the kid"" according to the interview scene that can be seen at the end of this movie but I personally think that this movie is made for entertainment. It reflected the California's life and that was cool and hilarious. It might be disturbing to some people, but so what? it keeps you awake. I mean when you came with your girl, or hanging out with your friends, I suggest you watch this movie. except fagot people, you might throw the drink on the screen lol.",Alpha Dog

185,mgrasso-2,"Fantastic Move, Fantastic Cast, Fantastic Acting",10,8 February 2007,"When Im trying to judge just how good a movie or show is, one thing I weigh very heavily is my reaction immediately leaving the movie theatre as compared to my pre judged notions of the film. More often than not, they match, be it good or bad. When they don't match however, thats the real indication of whether or not a movie is fantastic, or a real loser. -I went to the theatre tonight to see the movie Alpha Dog. Aside from the A-List cast that is attached to the movie, I knew nothing of the plot. I went in with a very negative attitude about the movie, and left truly amazed at its cinematic excellence. The first Hollywood ""home-run"" of the year. -Once you are able to shed your preconceived images of Timberlake as a boy band heartthrob, then you can really see just how amazing the acting is. What's ironic is, I expected Timberlake to be the weakest actor in the group, however he takes the cake for the best. He is able to transform a kidnapper into someone the audience sympathizes with. And likewise Emile Hersch turns the tragic Truelove character (Jesse James Hollywood in real life) into someone the audience despises. -The storyline is incredibly accurate to the true life events of the mass drug dealer Jesse James Hollywood. Hirsch's character, Truelove is owed some $1,200 from a former friend. En route to confront the friend, Ben Markowitz, he drives by Ben's half-brother Michael. Ben decides to abduct Michael and hold him as ransom. The story that follows is the quintessence example of Stockholm syndrome, when the abductee befriends the abductors. Because of the forced relationship surrounding the abduction, Timberlakes character and Michael (the abductee) become close friends throughout the ordeal. The end is guaranteed to have you in tears and its sheer emotional poignancy. -This movie is a real winner. The acting is strong and the storyline is powerful and accurate. It exposes the true danger of the life of a drug user and their families. I highly highly recommend seeing this film.",Alpha Dog

The movie consists of a bunch of hysterical young actors trying too hard and the storyline is rather schizophrenic. It's not clear what Alpha Dog tries to communicate but there's the usual mix of violence, racism and stupid bimbo girls. It seems to target a restless audience and gives the sense that the director, or at least most of the cast, was on some sort of amphetamines. And I doubt that all these kids and parents in the US behave like that. At least not the America I know! But granted the movie yields a few minor amusements - for one Justin Timberlake's facial expressions and questionable ghetto impressions offer a good laugh.

The plot is not overly intricate to the point that the viewers become lost...but complex enough to keep them guessing about the final outcome. It was a wonderful balance of intrigue and mystery.There were lots of depth to the characters and delightful performances. This is the first time I've seen Justin Timberlake acting and he was surprisingly believable in his role. Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone proved that they are still a strong force on-screen.

I laughed out loud several times in the movie (crazy how right on they were on some of the topics) and became very nervous myself towards the end.

Boy was I in for a treat. I cannot understand why people are giving ""this"" movie anything below 8 STARS. Forget about the story, you can ""spoil"" yourself by reading most of the other 100 reviews.What started out like a usual story suddenly turns into something so intense and interesting that it kept me wondering what would happen next for Zack. It is through his short experiences with all these unique characters that kept me asking for more. Yes the parties are over dramatic but everything else was done ever so perfectly. Every actor/actress played their part well. Anton Yelchin played a convincing portrayal of the innocence of a 15 year old. Justin Timberlake? Wow. I could not believe his acting, he started weak but after that he just blew me away. I think because he was in it I had first avoided this movie until now. Also Ben Foster played a gripping character as Zack's older brother(Jake). All the A-class stars played their short but impacting roles as parents.In the end it left my heart heavy and pounding. A MUST SEE MOVIE that starts slow but picks up the pace so fast. I would rate this movie a 8 but because of so many PITIFUL LOW STARS I have to give it a 10.

There was no decision to make the movie practically appeared by magic. From the beginning sequence when Sonny is talking to the interviewer to the scene when the kid climbs out his bedroom window I was literally in love with this movie. I was so into this movie I found myself staring at the television screen with my mouth open. As soon as the guys jumped the kid and stuffed him into the van my reverie was broken. (I seriously had no idea what this movie was about). As the movie progressed and the kid became one of the regulars I was once again enthralled. ""All right,"" I thought, ""the kid is on a vacation... no matter the circumstances he's having the time of his life."" He was hanging with people older than him, cooler than him, getting high, drinking, and having fun. Of course he would NEVER tell anyone he was kidnapped.... he's 15 and having a threesome. Then things got more intense and the topic of killing the kid came around. I honestly never thought twice about it. Around comes Elvis... I did not believe for one second that he would really kill the kid. I didn't. I believed 100% he was safe until the very last second before Elvis... That was it. I was so upset. I was so mad I never wanted to see it again. Of course, I finished watching it and realized it was a true story by the end sequence. The info on the guys made me feel a bit better. But I was still upset. Now here I am. Watching it again. The scene just passed where Jake asked for the money. I almost burst into tears. If only.... Anyway, enough with the dissertation.

These are a bunch of rich white kids that like to dress up and play thug, they act tough and pretend to be bad ass*s, but when the sh*t hits the fan, their true colors come out and you see that they are really just a bunch of pussies. This was perfectly acted, I'm sure we have all seen white fake ghetto kids before and this is exactly how they are.

196,JonnyGannett,"A powerful, heartbreaking, film that is underrated.",10,10 November 2012,"I rarely feel compelled to write reviews, but this is one I could not resist, I normally am to lazy to bother, but I had to give my opinion on this film. This movie is incredible. The director brings a film that sticks close to truth of the real life case that this Hollywood film is based off of. The acting is one of the most impressive things this movie did so well. And well normally I'd credit the writer above the director because they come up with the dialogue and tell us the story, this is based on a real life occurrence, so I'd expect a level of quality in the writing of such, and this is true here. Most people say that Justin Timberlake's performance is the most shocking and noteworthy, and he was very compelling and I think he does deserve credit for it. BUT, Ben Foster was incredible, where is his credit? He played not only such an aggressive man, but a drug addict. A complete junkie. His performance was not only terrifying, but saddening. Emili Hirsh was impressive too. I'm not denying that. His presence is essential through out the entire story. All of these people were young. In their early 20's. Johnny's 20, and Frankie's also 20. One of the things that really shows throughout, is most of them are hostel. They all call each other out with names, and fight. It's sad. It contributes to the outcome. Stupidity is one of the problems, and parental guidance was absent for most of these young people. This movie was not just cheap entertainment, although it does captivate you. It is well acted, well directed, and well handled. I find it irritating that it's only got 6.9 out of 10, and movies like : Pulp Fiction which has a 9 out of 10 rating, and is 4th on the top 250; while a great movie, completely fictional. But movies like this one get tossed under the rug and looked over. Don't miss this one. It's not really for younger audiences, cause most teenagers can't grasp such a complex plot without the only conclusion being these people are all stupid. I recommend this movie to anyone who is mature enough to hear the language or old enough. It's movies like this that should be at least nominated for awards, and yet it's not. Don't miss this one.",Alpha Dog
197,farsi3001,Real life... poor portrayal//The Good & Bad,5,12 January 2007,"I can only guess that the difficulty in making a movie based on real life is making it interesting enough for a variety of audiences to appreciate it while keeping the integrity of what truly transpired. Many of the comments clearly express what wasn't good about the movie--maybe overkill with the sex, cussing like mad men, drugs and alcohol. I'm not sure if all of this is that far off of what Valley suburban kids experience, but for the sake of art, let's say it was overdone.There is still a really incredible story to be told, and that's of a world of people that are so disengaged with reality that over 40 people saw an abducted 15 year old (the vast majority knowing that he'd been abducted) and literally did nothing to protect him. It's a real attempt to evaluate existentialism. Maybe a battle between individualism and collectivism. I'm not an expert in philosophy, but I really think this was demonstrated with the Frankie character played by Justin Timberlake. The relationship between him and Zack is incredible--- and while Timberlake's a young actor, I think he portrayed the emotions of Frankie incredibly well. Particularly because he's the character with the weakest will power but has the most understanding of the gravity of the situation and most sympathy to the boy. Ultimately, he's the character we must hate because he understands the most.It just makes you think about life, I suppose. Have you ever had a really bad week... and then you made a mistake that ended up going too far? Have you ever not been sure about what's right or wrong? And if you knew it was wrong, did you wonder if it was your responsibility to do the right thing? Did you maybe think everything would just end up okay because you wanted to protect yourself?

But please don't let that stop you from watching it. It is a story that deserves to be heard.I did not expect this movie to have the effect on me that it did. It starts out like a dozen or so other adolescent/drug related dramas so you might be quick to dismiss it but the director does this on purpose to lull you into a false sense of security before pulling your heart out in the final act. I'm 28 years old and I've seen this movie at least a dozen times but it still chokes me up at the end. This movie will make you sad at the end but also very, very angry. Angry at the kids who committed the crime, angry at the unwitting accomplices who did not stand up and help the boy, angry at the boy's brother for not handling his business and allowing it to spill over into his family's life, and angry at the parents of these kids for not parenting them and letting them run around doing whatever they want. This tragedy would have been avoided had any one single person stood up and did the right thing but none of them did.I know it will never happen but Justin Timberlake and Anton Yelchin deserve Oscar nominations for their roles here. I'm not even kidding. I never in a million years thought I'd be saying that about Timberlake before watching the movie as I am not exactly one of his fans but I must give credit where it is due. He is a natural, no joke. He has tons of charisma on screen and makes it look so easy...like he has been acting for years. Anton Yelchin was amazing as Zach. He displays a wide range of emotions flawlessly and is so convincing in his final scene it is scary. IMO he is the best young actor I have ever seen on screen. He even makes the pros look like ammatures in some parts of this movie.Timberlake and Yelchin have great chemistry together and you really feel as though their characters have developed a tight bond by the end. It is their characters' relationship to each other that makes the ending of this movie so poignant and powerful. I highly recommend it.",Alpha Dog
203,kevi747,Flawed but good,8,22 January 2007,"I can't decide if I'm glad I saw it or not. The movie had many flaws that others here have mentioned: Chopppy editing, an ending that dragged out far too long, Sharon Stone in a embarrassingly obvious fat suit, and seriously: What happened to Ben Fosters character? SPOILER ALERT! But the relationship between Justin Timberlakes and Anton Yelchins characters was absolutely heartbreaking. I almost had to walk out of the theater during the climax because it was so gut-wrenching to watch that terrified boy reaching out for comfort to the one who was killing him. That was maybe the most intense scene I've ever watched. I am so mad at Justin Timberlakes character for not saving him, because you know he cared about the kid and wanted to help him, but couldn't find the strength of character to do so.I am also a little mad at Mr. Cassavetes for not making this into the great movie it should have been. There was so much great acting and the story was Hollywood gold, but then he goes and throws in something so amateur all of a sudden, like the Kung Fu fight scene. What was that? Ben Foster couldn't defend himself very well while being thrown out of his bosses office, yet suddenly he's Bruce Lee. (And being attacked by a bunch of Asian guys to boot.)

It is especially tragic to see how Justin Timberlake's character can't stand on his own two feet and instead gets pushed around and also how people like ""Elvis"" will go too far for nothing but respect.

205,youngdre360,One Of The Few Movies Actually Worth Seeing.,8,19 February 2007,"When you go see this movie, you must see it as a true crime story, not another teenage popcorn flick. It's based on a story I'm quite familiar with, being an occasional America's Most Wanted viewer. The movie was made before the central figure in it, Jesse James Hollywood, was convicted of the crime portrayed in the movie. Living in this politically correct world, all names have been changed. The movie shed light on details not mentioned in the media, for fear of tarnishing the image of the victim, who was only engaging in behavior most kids his age happen to do. The same censoring people were children of the 60's and 70's, but it was okay for them because it was a time of ""free love"" and ""creativity.""Enough about that, let's get to the movie. It was produced using the input of a former prosecutor, who got fired just for working on the movie, so this is about as accurate as it can get. It's compiled of numerous court documents and interviews. The movie gradually evolves from a sort of comedy about extremely stupid criminals trying to figure out what to do with a kid they had no place kidnapping in the first place into a tragic turn of events. Out of lack of ideas at the moment, they leave him in the care of Frankie, surprisingly well played by Justin Timberlake. Even though I'm a fan of his solo music, I was a little unsure going in about his acting skills. he plays the ignorant, yet likable criminal very well. Over the next few days, the captors try to figure out what to do with the captured, while at the same time providing all of the amenities for a teenager. Then acting on extremely misguided legal advice from the worst lawyer in history, the chain of events leading to the most senseless conclusion are set in motion. Along the way, you will see bruised egos trying to make up for humiliation, criminals bouncing between sympathy and selfishness and back again, and above all, reality setting in for numerous people. My complaints are few, but substantial. At the beginning, a violent rap video is shown. It was extremely stereotypical and something you would never have seen on TV. It just furthered along misconceptions about the music, while at the same time, almost blaming rap for suburban privileged kid's criminal behavior. Another complaint was the obvious placement of products made after 1999, the year of the setting. Xboxes and flat screen HDTV's definitely not even thought about back then. Was it really that hard to find a Sega Dreamcast or Nintendo 64? the same goes for 23 inch rims. Above all, you would not be wasting your time to see this movie. It may change your mind about teenage crime dramas, even though the story is true, so it has a leg up on the scripted movies.",Alpha Dog

I love movies based on true events, especially true crime events. The movie was just so sad, especially when you know that it is based on a crime that actually happened. Even though I LOVE Emile Hirsch, I didn't find him to be all that convincing in this movie as the hardcore drug dealer who orchestrated this whole crime, although he was really good. BUT upon learning more about this story, Emile seems to be very similar to Jesse James Hollywood, at least in stature and action. Hollywood wasn't a very big man and the more I read about him the more I see how well Emile did on portraying him. Justin Timberlake was awesome as were the men who played Elvis and Keith. And the guy who played Jake was fabulous! Absolutely awesome job.In reviews that I read before seeing the movie, many people commented on the amount of drug use and cussing. And I agree that there was a lot of both. But I believe that it didn't take away from the movie at all and in fact, I believe that without the drugs you wouldn't even have a movie since that is the whole basis for the crime.By the way, the dates on the movie were incorrect (don't know if that was on purpose or not).

208,kurtpoke90,An excellent movie perfectly portrayed by talented actors,10,17 August 2007,"Well there is so much to say about this movie. It's simply amazing. The acting in this movie is top notch, with almost every actor delivering knockout performances. Justin Timberlake played amazingly well and had to have (much to my dislike in the guy) given the best performance (the climax is where he really shined, actually bringing a tear to my eye). He portrays excellently as the right hand man. Also, Ben Foster plays an excellent role as the crazy strung out junkie with nothing to lose. The guy just has natural talent and perfectly portrays his role. Bruce Willis, though his role was minor, played a great supporting actor (as expected) to the rest of the film. Emile Hirsch plays as the wanna-be white boy gangster, though his character was portrayed nicely, there could have been improvement in his character development, other than him being a paranoid wanna-be gangster. Anton Yelchin is the hostage and is the reason the movie exists. I'd have to say that his performance was good, but could have been a lot better, though in the climax and his final scene, he really did shine as his character.Keep in mind that this movie is NOT for children. This movie has everything in it, drugs, alcohol, teen partying, underage alcohol consumption, sex, violence, drama, everything to make a movie R-rated. Though this description of the movie is misleading and can lead people who don't like this kind of content away from the movie, this movie should not be missed. It greatly portrays how parents affect their children in every way, the underlying message being to love your children and take care of them. This movie has become one of my all-time favorite movies and touches me every time. Also keep in mind that this movie is based off of a true story, though you probably already knew that. And that's the thing about it. It's based off of real events. Though the scenes in this movie don't follow exactly fact for fact about what happened in the real events, it doesn't stray too far from the truth. Nick Cassavetes directed this movie to perfection, even going all the way as to developing a realistic relationship between the characters to enhance the execution of their roles.

So the movie is starring an ex-NSync member, the awkward guy from ""The Girl Next Door"", the girl from ""Mean Girls"", the girl from the OC, the archangel from X-3, and plenty more random people. I never expected Sharon Stone to take on such a small role but she played it very well. Anyways back to my point...I was impressed by these young actors who were able to grasp the characters so well. Of course it was amusing at first to watch Justin acting hard, but as the movie progressed, it seemed to have to a lot of depth. The acting felt so genuine especially due to Ben Foster's character. The ""stolen boy"" also made a breakthrough performance (never saw him from anywhere else) which surprised me. I was expecting to just see a flick with some drugs, violence, and teen behavior, and I did, but it was so much more than just that.I was impressed.",Alpha Dog
211,nick-1468,"Violent, Homophobic, if that's what you're into, then it's excellent",2,9 March 2007,"Backed on the premise of ""real-life"" reporting, this violent film blends violence and a depicts a collapse of values with video trickery, and smooth gangster rap soundtrack more commonly seen in R&B music videos... The end result is, sadly, just another glorification of violence, precisely the kind of thing the film pretends to be criticizing. The dialog contains so many ""co** s**ckers"", ""fag*ots"", ""di** s**ckers"" and ""queers"" as to be offensive and unbearable. Just try and count them - it's astounding. I guess you could say that it shows that homophobia goes hand in hand with a complete collapse of moral values portrayed by the characters, but personally I thought it just showed the ignorance and lack of vocabulary of whoever wrote the dialog.",Alpha Dog

214,paulfranklfc-1,At times brilliant but still a flawed film,7,22 April 2007,"Alpha Dog is overall a good film and worth the money. The plot is full of interesting elements and it is acted with power. Justin Timberlake, Emile Hirsch and Anton Yelchin shine among a large group of talent. Anton Yelchin in particular portrays his character with the vulnerability and naivety required and creates a character that the audience can connect with. The fact that the film poster contains the words victim,suspect and witness hints that the film will not end on a happy note but despite this you can still identify with the characters. At times the swearing is over the top and every second word is f**k, it sounds fake and forced and is the main reasons why the film did not get a higher rating. The only source of laughter comes from seeing Sharon Stone in a fat suit. Alpha Dog would be worth renting or buying on DVD but be warned it is not the happiest of films.",Alpha Dog
215,kristina_3186,Absolutely stunning!,9,28 November 2006,"This film was incredible! I just saw it at a special advanced screening at the University of Texas at Austin and was stunned!! I had wanted to see this movie for the longest time and read up on the actual events and stories. This film was a roller coaster of emotion--it starts off making me laugh (even though i knew how the film would end) but then gets extremely intense with such a gripping ending!!! I laughed, I cried...I'd see it over and over again!!! I'd recommend it to anyone! A MUST SEE!!! Nick does an excellent job of directing this film, which is quite a stretch from the feel good-mushy ""The Notebook""---this film is great for young adults and older ones alike, though it ain't for kids. ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLY STUNNING!!",Alpha Dog
216,deceptive-paint-works,Cut-throat and Raw,9,14 January 2007,"As a fan of Justin Timberlake, I chose to see Alphadog, thinking I'd be dissatisfied with his performance. I definitely walked out of the movie on opening night thinking otherwise. Justin did an amazing job of pulling you into the movie, and really making you feel a sense of sympathy and love for the kid, Zach Mazursky. It gives you an amazing and detailed glimpse of the dangers of the drug world. Emile Hirsch was definitely great at playing his character, Johnny Truelove, and I was very intrigued and fascinated with his intense portrayal of the real life drug dealer, Jesse James Hollywood. Throughout the movie, Timberlake really makes you think he has a chance at saving the kid, but all goes wrong when Hirsch offers $2,500 to Timberlake to whack the kid.I suggest that you see the movie, and afterwords, go to crime-library.com to read the real story of Jesse James Hollywood. This movie portrayed the real life events in a very detailed and accurate manner.",Alpha Dog
217,jadetrow,Haunting!,10,16 January 2007,"This movie sent me on such an emotional roller coaster! I laughed hyserically at parts and then left crying and upset. I'm still not over it and I saw it four nights ago. However, reading some of the reviews, I can see that some people just didn't get it. People wrote that there were parts where they laughed when it wasn't supposed to be funny. I didn't see it that way. All of the parts that I perceived as comical, I think were meant to seem that way. I don't think the pot smoking was too much. This case is about a drug dealer! Of course there's drug use in it! As for there being too much sex, I didn't see that either. There were a few scenes that weren't even that bad. Someone said to see Bully if you want to see a good true crime movie. I couldn't disagree more. If people thought there was too much drugs and sex in Alpha Dog, there is no way they are going to be able to handle Bully. That is about one sex scene short of being a porno! Alpha Dog is better, it has more emotion and it leaves you hurting. I am completely haunted by the crime that was carried out by those kids. I knew the back story of the crime and I was holding out hope through the whole movie that it would not end as it did in real life; with a murder. It was good, entertaining, funny at parts, sad at parts, haunting and worth every cent of the ten dollar admission fee.",Alpha Dog

219,voomvivi,Great Movie,10,14 January 2007,"I thought the movie was exciting. The director and cast gave fine performances. Although the story is disgusting, the portrayal was brilliant. Justin Timberlake did an outstanding job as an actor, and I, for one was skeptical. He showed range and presence. The director was brilliant in his story telling as he was in another great film, The Notebook. Although the two stories are night and day, they were both helmed with a skilled director. All of the actors cast in the film gave some of their best and most entertaining performances in their career. Both Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone were believable in their stories of the parents of both accused and victim. Emile Hirsch was sleazy in his portrayal of Johnny Truelove and I don't mean this negatively. The character Johnny Truelove was as low as some go and Emile did his job in portraying the character. Emile is a strong actor and is very authentic in his performance.",Alpha Dog
220,simd109,Waste of Time,3,27 November 2006,"About 70% of this movie is comprised of people smoking pot. If watching other people smoke sounds interesting, go to a VFW or a small-town bar and enjoy. Besides the effect of interrupting conversations to continually puff away, the smoking has no bearing on the plot and even in scenes where it effects characters' behavior, it still does not change the events. Besides that, there is an unnecessary amount of swearing in this movie. Personally, I have no problem with swearing and do it regularly, but this movie is often just offensive for no reason at all. Along with that, the dialogue and acting often lead to funny moments (it isn't a comedy), something that usually isn't intentional. When the subject matter is trying so hard to be serious, something stupid will come along to upset the moment. Not to spoil anything, the plot line that dominates the first half of the movie goes unresolved. Last complaint has to do with the whole ""inspired by actual events"" thing. While mixing reality with the dramatization of the movie is interesting, there isn't enough emotion invested in the characters (largely due to the lack of character development) to care about what happens to them.On the bright side, Justin Timberlake shines and does a wonderful job of both creating a real character and pulling empathy from the audience.",Alpha Dog
221,wilso910,Awesome,10,28 November 2006,"I had the chance to see an early screening of Alpha Dog and listen to director Nick Cassavetes during a following Q&A in Minneapolis. The movie was phenomenal. The characters were developed well (some better than others) which I thought was quite an accomplishment in a film with many great actors and not enough time for the spotlight to go around. The plot is based on a true story and according to Mr. Cassovetes its around 95% accurate, and the best he could do. He put forth the effort to communicate with all of the ""real"" people portrayed in the film and wrote the dialogue and relationships based on their encounters as well as information from the media and judicial system. As the story unfolds I think the viewer is compelled feel close to Justin Timberlake's character. This feeling was the reason the end of the film tied my stomach into a ball in a way I haven't felt since viewing Mystic River. This is not a feel good movie, but if you like accurate non-fiction films and can appreciate the commitment to excellence a great director makes, you will love Alpha Dog as well.",Alpha Dog
222,matelowkryptonite,Good Stuff,5,31 March 2007,"I was thoroughly surprised at Justin Timberlake's acting skills and thought he put in a very good performance.The only one thing that i didn't follow in the film was why no-one smacked Johnny Truelove because he obviously had no balls when it came down to it. The second Johnny Truelove offered to pay me to kill the boy i would've phoned the cops.Grass or no grass the way Johnny spoke to people he needed to be the only one going down.I was confused when i couldn't figure out whether the blond chick that came o Justin's dads place was his sister or some sweet hot chick.I never saw this previewed at the cinema but i'm glad as it mean't it came to DVD sooner and was well worth the money, in my opinion.Justin has come on leaps and bounds from his Disney days, a lot like Britneys hair, oh no she left that somewhere. Good luck to him",Alpha Dog
223,cohoskatr420,"Not bad, not great, well worth watching",7,13 January 2007,"OK so I feel inclined to defend this movie considering that last review was so harsh. I truly and genuinely enjoyed this movie, however there are several points which restrict this movie from reaching its fullest potential- it could have been a great movie. It may throw off a casual movie-goer expecting to see an action film full of explosions, guns and sex although there is plenty of that content here sure not to disappoint. Throughout the movie there is a comedic sense to situations also helped by good character development. While on that subject I must mention the great work by Justin Timberlake. And I say this as a person who almost refused to watch the movie because he was in it, he commits to a good performance and I was impressed by his role. All in all if it wasn't for a few holes in the plot and a few over-exaggerated circumstances this could have been one of my favorite movies. I remember feeling the sense in the theater that I really hoped the movie would hold up in the end, but when I left I felt a sense of disappointment, not in the film itself but that it held such a greater potential. I recommend this film for the typical movie watcher to see a good movie and for aspiring filmmaker, directors, actors and alike to see and learn how a great movie and cast can fall just short of amazing.",Alpha Dog

I know many people who act exactly like this (maybe not to the extremes in the movie but still). JT rips the acting no doubt, tight movie,maybe you can't be OLD to enjoy this one. The only real problem I found with Alpha Dog was the fact it stated ""witness #x"" which gave away the fact that he would be killed in the end. Also, gotta give some props to that dude from girl next door playin True Love, he sure looks like Dicrapio. But again, JT rips the actin, much love for him on this one, see alpha dog, if you don't like it, you're prolly too old to get it. Why the hell does this have to be 10 lines, I don't get that rule it really makes no sense to me.

225,raylaff,Did everyone else see the same movie I saw?,1,21 January 2007,"The first reviewer probably could have stopped at ""This movie sucks."" The language? Whatever, that's probably accurate to the culture being depicted. But why does it take 20 minutes (it seems much much longer) before you start to find out what the movie's about? There are way too many wasted scenes; it seems like Timberlake's agent negotiated his screen time and scenes that marginally relevant are included to give him the chance to point and yell at someone. At nearly two hours, the movie's way too long.Sharon Stone will surely get a Razzy Award for overacting. Was that entire interview sequence with her near the end of the film really necessary? It's as if Cassavetes said, ""we spent all that money on making her up to look fat. I'm using as much of that as I can."" Surely, he realized in editing that the movie was too boring and added all those ridiculous split screens. Umm... didn't work.Hopefully, everyone in the cast will take their earnings and get acting lessons.Two things that made this two hours of my life that I'll never get back bearable: Amanda Seyfried is adorable and I saw the movie on free passes.",Alpha Dog
226,HurtbyHauntedWoe,Wonderfully Emotional,10,10 January 2007,"After seeing 'Alpha Dog' through a sneak screening at a local theater I am left completely stunned. Mr. Cassavetes has done an amazing job capturing the essence of this story. The way you are put into the prospective of what happened, the way you see what happened as though you are actually experiencing for your self, its absolutely brilliant. You see it all through the eyes of these characters.I read in an interview a while back during my obsession with the back story of this film, that Mr. Cassavetes said he wanted to portray this film as a party that after a while you really wanted to get out of. A spot of description. Even with the knowledge that I had in the back of my mind I fell in the depths of the stories. I fell in love with the characters. Watched through their daily lives like I was apart of the time. After everything happens I was left wondering how to feel about the way I reacted to the characters. A sense of guilt. You don't really know how to feel. An amazing job was done on part of the cast. They truly make you believe in this lifestyle and the process in which it takes. Anton Yelchin and Justin Timberlake, who both undoubtedly in my opinion carry the movie, definitely stand out among the rest who also gave note worthy performances. If you didn't know any better you'd swear these are the real people and this is simply a documentary of what actually happened.I have never been on a more emotional ride than I have with this film. From top to bottom it demands your attention which in the end is pummeled to the floor in one way or the other. A movie that certainly grips you. Making you honestly think about the right and wrong decisions in life. This movie was excellent, and I give the cast full credit along with Mr. Cassavetes. I have never left a movie feeling the way I did with 'Alpha Dog', whether it was in a good way or bad. Certainly I will be seeing it again.",Alpha Dog
227,vegs8,"slow at times, but worth the wait",8,19 January 2007,"I thought this movie would not be that great to be honest. I've been following the case of Jesse James Hollywood since the beginning and really felt like I'd made all of my assumptions and conclusions about who these kids were and what made them tick. But Cassavetes manages to bring them to life, give (some of) them a conscience and pull you into the story. I was pleasantly surprised by Timberlake's performance. After seeing Edison, I wasn't sure if he could pull off this role, but he did. The scenes between him and Yelchin are the heart and soul of this film. Emile Hirsch is brilliant as always and Ben Foster manages once again to freak me out and intrigue me at the same time. He is truly a master of his craft. Although a little slow at times, the climax makes it all worthwhile; a gut-wrenching, heartbreaking scene. I would recommend this film to others who have an open mind and are willing to look past some of the choppiness of the cinematography and other things that are just plain random.",Alpha Dog
228,rosegrrl17,realistic glimpse of the horrors of the drug culture,9,12 January 2007,"I'm writing this in response to simd109. i just got home from seeing the movie and i thought it was fantastic. as for the swearing, that's how a lot of people talk and i personally think that aspect added to the reality of the movie. i am pretty closely connected with that kind of culture and in real life people talk like that. if the audience thinks this is offensive, maybe it's because the word 'cunt' shouted at your mother is MEANT to be offensive. in terms of the 'watching people smoke' complaint, i don't even understand why that could be a complaint. the movie was about drug dealers, one of whom had a gigantic stand of pot plants in his yard. of course they're going to smoke. a lot of the movie took place in parties and social settings where people would be smoking in real life too. once again, i think that aspect only contributed to the REALITY of the story. it might be a little strange if you knew all the characters did drugs but you never saw even the quickest glimpse of any. about the unintentional humor, once again, sometimes even if something really bad is going on in your life, you might sneak a laugh here and there. i really liked the little bits of humor. overall i thought the movie was really good. all the characters were really well acted, especially the kid's brother who had a few scenes where he was massively tweaking out on speed. i was impressed by how realistic and startling it was. to me and probably a lot of people Alpha Dog hit really close to home because it was so true to life. it was the kind of story that i can imagine reading in the newspaper and saying, 'oh wow, i know those guys', or 'i was at that party'. i am in no way trying to compare the two, but alpha dog reminded me a little of requiem for a dream just because in the end of both movies you walk away with 'wow, seemingly benign situations can get REALLY out of hand sometimes'maybe stories like this wouldn't happen if drugs were legalized and governmentally regulated? i can't help but think.",Alpha Dog

This makes 'Gigli' look good. Literally ever other word was a ridiculous out of context swear word, as if anybody talks like that. It even leads you on by listing the witnesses at every scene.

Yes, it is a movie but it was real life, it is a real story, it is real history. The entire reason the first half of the movie went unresolved is because towards the second half it wasn't about the money it was about the boy. They displayed them smoking in between dialouge because i'm sure thats exactly what they did, and the comedy is there because they didn't think it was that serious until the kid was suppose to be killed so before they planned to murder him they are going to joke in day to day conversations. Isn't that what you do with your friends??",Alpha Dog
231,mindlessjenn,I liked it!,10,13 January 2007,I thought it was a good movie. It had some funny moments in it and some shocking ones. I'm a fan of Ben Foster's acting and i thought he did a good job. And i must say that I was impressed with Justin Timberlake's performance. He did a very good job with his character. It was definitely a crazy and interesting movie. I heard that Ben had to have glaucoma drops in his eyes for the role to look like a drug addict. He had to hide from the lights so they didn't damage his eyes between scenes. It was quite a shocker seeing Sharon Stone made to look 50 pounds over weight for one of the last scenes. I definitely think this movie had potential. The only thing that bothered me is that they didn't say what happened to Ben Foster's character at the end. Other then that it was good.,Alpha Dog
232,n_hazelgrove,A dichotomy of emotions; surprisingly great,9,13 January 2007,"The movie had it's good points and bad points. Some of the cinematography served no purpose, such as the double-camera takes during various scenes. Cassavetes had these takes done during editing, so it was something that he intentionally did, but as I said before, it served no purpose. Some loose ends are left untied, such as the mysterious disappearance of Jake, a main character, without any explanation. One other critique I have is that when Elvis and Frankie are taking Zack out to kill him, while, simultaneously, Truelove's father is ordering him to call off the deal, they only switch the scene once. I felt more tension could have been added by switching back and forth or having Truelove call Elvis, to no avail, because the phone didn't receive signal or was left in the car. On a more positive note, I found the movie to be realistic and emotion-evoking. Timberlake was powerful. His final scene with Zack was very intense, and I feel that Timberlake could take on a lead role in the near future. Look for his up and coming acting career. Overall, I found the movie to be entertaining and served its purpose well. Regardless of one's opinion about the behavior, language, lifestyle, etc. of the characters, the movie was closely based on the actual events that led to the murder of a teenager in a drug money dispute. Cassavetes did his job, and did it pretty well.",Alpha Dog

They involve two entirely different areas of the drug world. If you compared the story of Bruce Willis's character in this movie to the main character in ""Blow"", you might get closer to a valid comparison.However, I do have to admit that the storyline is completely summarized in the movie preview. And if this movie isn't closely related to the actual storyline, it's a waste of your money to see it in theaters.",Alpha Dog
234,movieman5566,Definitely flawed but...,7,14 January 2007,"I am going to start out by saying yes there are a lot of problems with this film. Some of the acting is overdone, the writing questionable for the first 40 minutes or so, and in that time it almost felt that the incredibly talented cast of some of the greatest young actors in Hollywood today were put to waste. I for one can say that after the first half hour I was feeling I might have regretted spending my 10 dollars, As I had been waiting for months for this movie to be released but once the film reached it's climax something very unexplainable happened. I myself am a filmmaker and I can say that Cassavettes did go way over the top with many things... there were laughs in the theater when there wasn't suppose to be, but when the movie hit it's turning point people shut up real quick.It's been two days since I've seen the movie and I am still thinking about that scene. It has to be one of the most powerful, gut wrenching scenes I have seen all year. Only if Mr. Cassavette's had been so subtle with the rest of the movie as he was in those 7 mins or so, Alpha dog would probably be one of the best films of the year. Anton Yelchin will break your heart in half, and anybody skeptical about Justin Timberlake can throw those thoughts to the wind because they both carried the show. Timberlake blew me away and I think that a lot of people will be surprised with his performance.I guess it's wrong to try and tell someone to go see a film because it has redeeming qualities in the end, but as frustrated as I was with the first little while, I left the theater with a strong feeling still in my stomach. The people who cracked laughs when it was not the films intention, in the end had nothing but gasps and some even tears. This movie still will prove to be too much for some because of it crossing over into Larry Clark territory with its persistent, vulgar, degrading language. I could see what the director was trying to strip these wanna-be thug white boys into nothing but young fake suburban kids. I know and have met people who act this way and speak with language like this so it's not completely un-justified for the characters, but it's just not needed that much to get the point across. Either way I encourage people to try and decide for themselves because I don't think you will leave the film with a judgement set in stone.",Alpha Dog

Oh yeah and Justin Timberlake, and Bruce Willis were in it. However when I heard that the true kidnapped boy was killed I was wondering how they were going to portray that. The movie definitely kept my eyes glued to it. I thought the acting was great but the story was even better. I hope that everyone gets the same message I got from it: If you are in to drugs don't screw with the wrong guys, always pay your debts, and watch your back b/c you never know who might be out to hurt you.

At several points in the movie i actually found my mouth hanging open in surprise or disbelief. The comical mischief that's thrown around as padding might throw some off but the seriousness of how things are treated comes through to provide an ultimately well balanced film.

These people of who he himself portrays are outcast's otherwise known as losers. The movie was awesome it started out a little hazy from the early recordings of what I assumed were the actors as children at ages 4-5 years old and laying the scene for how corrupt these innocent children become. Justin Timberlake played the part of the group friend who really wasn't down with the last minute plot to kidnap the boss's (truelove) rivals little brother and throughout the film it is about how the kidnapping really took you into the true life of well to do income white family's in the southern California realm, as if there are any n on well to do white family's in southern Ca. I within the past two years moved back from living in San Diego, Ca for the past five years from age 18-22 and can from experience vouche for the culture it displays. The movie ended in the mass confusion of young men not knowing what to do and make all the wrong decisions which all culminated to the death of the kidnapped 15 year old. But you got to see behind the scenes the real life of the Orange county bull$hit and into the real land, like Hermosa Beach, Pomona, Claremont, San Diego, Irvine. All real places that everyone hides behind the Orange county logo. The real parties the real flamboyant attitude of the girls and the tatted up careless speech excerpts from the guys. There was no competition to see how many times the word Fu*k could be said like the jacka$$ before me wrote it is real life talk in our un-tamed culture!! I cant stand older people who have no idea what a film is based on try and act like the understood it and still say it sucked. Who is this guy? I loved the film and you will to if you are from the ages of 14-29. It is truth and it helps young women and men understand the importance of not getting too deep in trouble and to always know that if you are its never as deep as you think it is and there is always room to back out before you go over the deep end and end up in prison for life.

I saw the previews while watching 'Black Christmas' which was terrible by the way. It looked alright but the more I saw the previews on TV or wherever the better it began to look. So some friends today said they would see it again to go with me. Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. I've been seeing a lot of crap lately that I feel like is completely played out with nothing that is out of the usual or of in any interest to me. This movie looked like it had a lot of potential to follow suit but I wanted to give it a try. I definitely was proved wrong...there are still good movies to be made. I thought all the ideas were gone and everything was outplayed and had nothing that was out of the expected. This movie definitely ended in a way that I never really came to expect...I do have to see as a 18 year old guy who is somewhat of a light hearted one it did make me shed a tear.....Definitely well worth the few bucks to watch it....will make a great addition to my DVD collection in a few months.

Emile Hirsch and Justin Timberlake were incredible. I remember the father being interviewed on America's most wanted and it really seemed to be realistic. Shawn Hatosy is a great actor that seems to never get the credit that he should. He should be more of a lead than just a character actor by now. His body of work is impressive. Emile Hirsch has been terrific in everything I've seen him in. Also, Anton Yelchin and Julie Beckley are always impressive. Of course, Bruce Willis, Sharon Stone and Harry Dean Stanton are always stellar and make their characters real.",Alpha Dog
240,Kyle-a-tonione,Alpha Dog,8,18 January 2007,"I went into this film very weary about seeing Justin Timberlake in a film. After th film I was very impressed and would definitely see it again and again. The film basically looks at the character Jonny Truelove who is a drug dealer in California. Everything begins to unfold when a deal goes wrong and Jonny is not getting paid. With all his wits and brains working for him Jonny decides to kidnap the kid brother of the guy who owes him money. After the kidnapping occurs Truelove realizes that everything is unraveling and he is obviously losing his control. He puts the kid under the supervision of his partner/best friend Frankie(played by Justin Timberlake). Timberlake takes the kid under his wings and treats him just like he was one of the boys. The kid coming from a disgruntled home situation doesn't want to go home and really doesn't mind the fact that he has been kidnapped. He is having the time of his life with all the partyin, drugs alcohol and beautiful women he could ever want the kid is living it up. The story eventually comes to an end when Truelove decides that the kid must die and he needs his boys to do it. Everyone in Truelove's crew is accused of some form of kidnap or murder and are sentenced to jail. Truelove manages to escape and becomes the youngest man on the FBI's most wanted list he is eventually caught and is awaiting the death penalty in jail. All in all I recommend this film to everyone it is very well done and quite realistic.",Alpha Dog
241,soccersk8,"good story, bad directing",8,20 January 2007,Overall i think this is an amazing and great story. It was just murdered by the horrible directing and bad camera work. I guess we can excuse the director though because he's not necessarily the best out there. I think a better director should have got a hold of this story. If this would have happened the movie would be unforgettable and so would the story. The movie was poorly pieced together and some sequences seemed to be out of place or just didn't need to be in the movie at all. I missed 20 minutes of the movie because someone called me and when i finally came back in i asked what i had missed and my friends said nothing. They were right because i was fine with whatever piece i had missed and was able to continue watching and comprehending the movie. GOOD STORY BAD DIRECTING.. i think you should still go watch it if you don't know the story. It's amazing what people can and will do.,Alpha Dog
242,MlKES_EMAIL,This Movie Was Horrible,1,20 January 2007,"Okay for beginners, if you would like to see a decent film with similar ideology please save yourself the money and go rent ""Running Scared"". The use of vulgarities is far too excessive and underagressive. Character progression as a whole is alright. They still stand pretty predictable as to when ideals and actions will change in compliance with the plot line. Justin Timberlake, sadly, *aside from Bruce Willis*, is the best actor in this film. The choreography, videography and production of this movie were all atrocious. The filming took a large step back from pretentiousness and left it to the basics, that is until it made it to a few select scenes, in which the screen would split into separate sections showing reactions of a select group of people. This though, was done in a very amateurish manner and was more of a hindrance than anything else. The ending, was anti-climatic and that is decorating it more that it deserves.

243,w-ken,Dumb White wanna-be gangsters,5,1 February 2007,"I went and saw this movie because it was the only thing starting at the time I arrived at the theater. I'd seen the previews on T.V. so I thought i'd give it a try. Now let me preface this by telling you that I'm 46yrs old and have been a police officer for 25yrs. This story is typical of what we see everyday, rich or middle class white kids trying to be gangsters and hardcore crooks. It never works, just like in this movie they eventually turn out to be big BABIES. I'm not a Justin Timberlake fan ( because of age ) but I must admit he did an admirable job in this movie. Ben Foster I thought stole the show with his over the top maniacal performance as the Jewish bad guy. Does everyone in California have multiple tattoos or what? This movie surprised me, I was'nt expecting much going in but I was mildly entertained. It's a hoot watching these young privileged white kids trying so hard to be hardcore. Pretending to be bad ass is not the same thing as being true bad ass and these kids paid the price for pretending. If anything this movie may teach the young aspiring well off white kids not to try to be hardcore gangsters. There is nothing funnier than seeing a rich white kid trying to be hardcore. This movie proves that theory in spades.",Alpha Dog
244,mcleoddarryl,What a film!!,8,25 April 2007,"Probably the best film I have seen in a long time. It was only afterwards I realised it was based on a true story, and I was a little worried about the content. After watching the film, my fears were put aside and I marvelled at the film. Even Justin Timberlake was amazing, which worries me slightly as his target audience normally (with his music) seems to be aimed at the mid to late teens. The content of this film would stop me from letting a teen under 18 watching it, due to the drug use and sexual nature. I could see the funny side to the film, although I am not sure it was intentional, but when you get a bunch of young teenagers trying to be gangland leaders, what do you expect. I would happily sit and watch this film again and again.",Alpha Dog
245,jazzonasummersday,Surprisingly impressive. Brilliant performances and a great script.,8,17 April 2007,"With the exception of the Wahlberg brothers, pop-star-turned-actor movie experiments are not often recipes for stand-out performances (think Jennifer Lopez in Gigli or 50 Cent in Get Rich or Die Trying' or any of Madonna's numerous floptastic efforts), so the appearance of Justin Timberlake as one of the stars of Alpha Dog may not give the film much appeal. Anyone expecting to sit through two hours of absolute drivel could be easily forgiven, but fortunately, on watching Alpha Dog they would be proved totally and utterly wrong. In fact Timberlake truly steals the show with his performance as Frankie Ballenbacher, his delivery is witty and charming and his misguided torment, convincing to the end. But Timberlake is not the only great thing about this film, the entire cast is superb with particularly notable performances from Anton Yelchin as the film's focal character Zack Mazursky and Ben Foster, who's brilliant characterisation of Zack's drug-addict older brother, Jake Mazursky is a stark contrast to his former incarnation as the geeky art student Russell Corwin in HBO's Six Feet Under, which he played equally well. There is even a surprisingly good contribution from Olivia Wilde (whom many will recognise as Alex Kelly from TV's The O.C.) as Angela Holden, the girlfriend of the film's main protagonist, Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch). Remarkably faithful to the actual events on which it is based, the film tracks three days in the lives of a group of Californian teens from an affluent area, led by dope dealer Johnny Truelove (Hirsch). Riled by a former friend Jake Mazursky (Foster), who owes him money, Johnny and his compatriots kidnap Jake's younger brother Zack (Yelchin) to use him as a marker until Jake comes up with the money. Soon the group realise that they have made an error of judgement and that they could be in serious trouble, but in the hedonistic, party atmosphere surrounding his kidnap the naïve Zack is unaware of how much danger he is in and makes no effort to escape. What writer and director Nick Cassavetes gives us is much more than a crime film. As the story progresses the several witnesses to a crime that has not yet reached its tragic climax are labelled in turn and an increasing feeling of impending doom hangs over the plot. This is offset by the revelling and camaraderie of the kidnappers and their friends, all helped to move pacily along by a great script with its delightful comic interludes. The film becomes more about a 'coming of age' for Zack and an examination of youth culture and the dangerous effects of a lack of good parental guidance. Some of the film's success could be attributable to Casavetes's rather unorthodox rehearsal methods. He demanded that the cast convene daily, starting very early in the morning, to take part in a vigorous fitness training regime. What he hoped to achieve by making himself the slave driver and common enemy, was a pack mentality where the cast bonded over what they really didn't want to be doing. It worked. The sense that these youngsters rely on and respond to one another absolutely is unmistakable.If there is any fault with this film it is that it might have been just 15 to 20 minutes shorter, as the extended conclusion is a little unnecessary, but all in all the script, the performances, the plot and the end product are a triumph and spectacular to watch. For a filmmaker who's earlier efforts include the insipid 'chick flick' The Notebook this is a truly remarkable step up.",Alpha Dog

247,absentic,Vulgar and simple-minded. Beware.,1,5 November 2007,"I simply had to comment on this movie, just to warn others.First, I'm giving it 1 star because it has picture and audio and both are in sync. The rest... well, read on if you want.Let's get down to it. On the box, it's stated that the movie ""loosely"" follows real events. That's all fine and dandy, but I believe that if the writer would have followed reality more closely, he would have ended up with a better movie.The movie is laden with profanity. Now, I have an extremely high tolerance for swearing and other vulgarities, but this movie made me spill my beans. The words/phrases ""f*ck, motherf*cker, c*ck, suck my d*ck, a*shole, f*ck you"" are used what felt like several thousand times. Most of the dialogue consists of these words in addition to ""dude, yo"" and ""man"". In a sense, I felt that the writer created an original script with dialogue but later when Mr. Timberlake was added to the cast, that dialogue was re-written to try to shift Mr. Timberlake's image from the good boy to a much more street-credible bad-ass.The movie begins with a bunch of wannabe-gangsters listening to rap and acting like thugs. Keep in mind that these are high middle-class white boys and girls. How the director/writer ever felt anybody would feel anything but pity for such one-dimensional characters, is a true mystery that will possibly never be solved. As the pedestrian dialogue started pouring from my speakers, I immediately believed this to be a mood-setting element which would then calm down as the plot thickened and got more serious. I kept hoping, but by the 40-minute mark I realized it was not to be. The crudeness of the script radiated through all elements of the movie. The writer/director even managed to slip in a female line: ""Let me suck your dick, please"". Hands up, who has heard that? More earthy dialogue and acting follows ad nauseam until the nonsensical ending.Speaking of events, the movie has no tangible plot. It mostly follows these white suburbian kids as they perform various activities: smoke weed, get drunk, fornicate, fight and/or threaten their parents. I've seen some bad movies, having a personal collection of over 350 (most not bad, however) but I have never seen a worse film than ""Alpha Dog"". Here's to hoping that the creator of this movie, Nick Cassavetes, never gets funding to create another monster.",Alpha Dog

They didn't represent the story of Jessie James Hollywood correctly. If you are interested in renting or buying this movie, Don't! I hate this movie to an extreme and i don't recommend it at all. Bruce Willis is the first actor described on the top and is in the movie for 5 minutes. Like I said before all the actors attempted to be gangsters and completely failed.

In addition, many of the actors were not convincing in front of the camera - this excludes Justin Timberlake and Ben Foster, who I thought did a pretty good job for newcomers. Oldtimers like Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone prove that they can act, but they are only seen in a few of the less important scenes - why the director chose to do this I do not know. In one of the most powerful scenes Sharon Stone is one-on-one with the camera, but they put her in a fat-suit and hide her face behind too much makeup which takes away from, rather than adds to, her powerful acting.

255,ziggyzwbf,Realism Hits Home,9,15 October 2008,"This film was certainly not one for the wealthy rural individuals. On the other hand, it certainly was perfectly fitting for individuals who are surrounded by similar situations throughout daily life. If you have never met a drug dealer, or dealt with any form of drugs, then of course you wouldn't enjoy this movie. It shows the process and intensity of selling drugs. It also shows the disturbing and heart-wrenching problems of drug dealing, for example the kidnapped fifteen year old being murdered when he was originally being held as collateral. This is a world absorbed by money, and drug dealers apply that to their lives the most. This film also displays the consequences of terrible decision making and poor parenting. In the movie, Sonny Truelove (portraying Jesse James Hollywood's father Jack Hollywood) states, ""You wanna know what this is all about? You can say it's about drugs or guns or disaffected youth, or whatever you like. But this whole thing is about parenting. It's about taking care of your children. You take care of yours, I take care of mine."" Although it can be a difficult movie to watch due to the fact of all the suspense building up until the surprising murder ending, it displays reality that applies to a mass amount of individuals spread out around the country. True Crime films tend to be the most intriguing and this film wasn't just intriguing, it was good and a personal suggestion for nearly anyone capable of relating to the realistic situations and issues seen in the film.",Alpha Dog
256,ejs1938,An Open Letter To Nick Cassavetes,1,13 January 2007,"Dear Sir: Your movie ""Alpha Dog"" mixes the very worst of the youth and drug culture into a disgusting orgy of idiocy, sex, and violence. In a shameful display of anarchistic and narcissistic youth run amok, you have given us quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. Since your father, John Cassavetes was an established director and actor; the critical establishment did not check and see if your movies were ever good. Not that the ""critical establishment"" has done the American public any favors as of late. Your cinematic canon has includes the instantly forgettable ""John Q."" and the nearly unviewable ""The Notebook"". This train wreck of a movie is more of the same. The opening credits of childhood home movies with an awful ""Over the Rainbow"" should put the viewer on notice right away that this could be a long night. The movies follows a bunch of spoiled kids as they deal narcotics in an operation that an average street junkie or public defender client would critique as ""amateur."" After some brief character introductions, the movie delves into a kidnapping sequence that degenerates into something resembling a narrative. I believe there was a part where a crack head/dealer and apparently martial arts expert kicks up everybody in a bar, but by that point in the movie, I was concentrating solely on how I could convince the rest of my party to leave, so I'm not entirely sure. There was also a scene where this same character took a dump on a carpet, but, again, at that point, I was feeling like you were taking a dump on my carpet and the smell was starting to waft into my bedroom. The story, or lack thereof, according to reports is supposed to be ripped from the headlines about an actual case in California. Next time, instead of ripping out this headline, rip out your notebook on which you scrawled this junk of a screenplay, and start over again.You know, Nick, It is fitting that two formerly 'good' (and I do use that term loosely) actors, Sharon Stone and Bruce Willis, are at their worst in this film. It's perhaps justice that these two people should be given a movie like this to work on, being at the end of their sad dead end career. Maybe you have a future doing Basic Instinct 3? You never know. You could then make the worst movie ever made then, maybe perhaps topping this. Oh, and here's a hint the next time you make or attempt to make a movie, save the split screen for the opening credits of the Brady Bunch, and try not to pretend like it's a original thought. You're not adding anything pleasurable to the viewing experience; you're just prolonging the torture. Oh, and Nick, while you are taking notes, when you are writing a screenplay, try and use a four letter word every other maybeummm5 words instead of every other word. Without the ubiquity of those four letter words, your movie would be a collection of prepositions. Now, don't get me wrong, even with that suggestion the viewing experience would be very painful, so the next time that you think of making a moviedon't. Spare the viewing public your drivel. The people that spent upwards of $ 10.00 will be more then willing to forgive you.Unfortunately, your movie is just one in a long line of exploitative films designed for middle class white kids that for some reason, worship ghetto (or inferior) culture. The best movies that deal with gangs/drug dealers ultimately and I know this is a hard thing to do for Hollywood, make judgments upon the characters they portray. For some reason, the critics have given you a free pass with this movie. Perhaps it's your father. (Hey, if it worked for the chief executive, it will more then likely work for a third rate filmmaker.) Perhaps its the topic of drugs in this film. A topic that Hollywood is all to eager to promote, market and sell to middle America. Hey, I can't complain, it puts a young criminal defense lawyer like me in business. Nick, look at the reviewers of this movie on a web-site such as IMDb. You can tell by their gnarled syntax and grammar that these are products of our excellent American public education system. They're the ones writing such memorable lines as ""However, once the movie begins, it doesn't stop until the end."" They are also the viewers who eat this garbage up like candy. You and others of your kind may not think you have a responsibility to make good films. You've been to film school, and you realize, unfortunately, that there is a market for a movie like this. This market is composed of white suburban kids with plenty of money who tell their clueless and self-obsessed parents that they are going to see ""Happy Feet"" tonight. So, let this letter be a turning point in your role as a filmmaker, but after you realize this epiphany sitting ensconced high in your resort home in the mountains, please refund my money back.",Alpha Dog

These characters are freaking drug dealing gang members, for crying out loud--what else would one expect? The acting was excellent, with Justin Timberlake surprising me the most. I didn't think I'd be able to take him seriously, but his performance really was the standout of the film. The characters, for the most part, aren't likable, but very realistic and well-played.The premise, of course, is based on a true story, but in my opinion was very well put-together so that it wasn't dull in any way, shape, or form.

265,jplishotter,Excellent!!,10,13 January 2007,"Alpha Dog was absolutely AMAZING. The language and drug use was strong and at some parts it was almost too much but, I never once got bored. I sat on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next. Usually, I am able to predict movies from just watching the trailer but Alpha Dog was different. I knew the behind story, the main character is a major drug dealer, he has his friends and groupies, he also has the ones who owe him money. They steal a kid related to someone who owed him money and holds the kid ransom. They party and introduce the kid into the world of sex, drugs, and partying. Yet, I couldn't predict the ending. The ending was a little upsetting but not at all disappointing. I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age 15 and under the age of 40. I was sitting next to a couple around the age of 50 who got up and left because they thought the movie was a little racy. That is the same reason why someone under the age 15 shouldn't see it. But, if you are between those ages, you'll love it.",Alpha Dog
266,webmaster-1705,justin's a surprise in this movie,10,13 January 2007,"this isn't going to be a standard review cuz i haven't written one in years, but i'll tell you this, if you're a fan of bruce willis or sharon stone, you might not get what you think... from the previews, it looks like both of them are pretty important to the movie, and technically they are, their characters are very important, and emile hirsch (johnny truelove) may be the main character in this storyline but justin timberlake (frankie ballenbacher) comes out as the star...ignore the negative reviews you may have heard or read, forget the rumors, gossip and nonsense that's been running wild lately, if it makes his acting easier to swallow, simply forget the music as well... go into this movie with an open mind and you'll be more than pleasantly surprised by justin's performance... many of the females in the audience admitted to me that they went to see the movie because he was in there, and i say great, because only a few, and i do mean a few (like 2 people) said they were shocked by his language and attitude in the movie, to which all i could say was ""it's based on a true story, he had to remain true to his character, don't confuse frankie with justin.""of the people i spoke with at length after wards, most of them walked away with the feeling of having gotten their money's worth and more than half of them said, and i quote, ""justin was amazing!"" all i can say is this, justin steals every scene he's in, if the critics and naysayers could back off long enough to recognize true talent when they see it, maybe this movie will get the credit it deserves... hats off to justin for his outstanding, award worthy performance... and this is not coming from an NSYNC fan, cuz to be honest, i know their music but wouldn't put myself in the same category as their ""fans"", i'm a movie fan and if something isn't worth my time, i don't watch and i certainly don't pay for it, but i've seen this movie twice now and believe me when i say it won't be my last...",Alpha Dog
267,losxn,good and bad,6,13 January 2007,"I think the reality of the film is in between both the opinions. Like they say, the truth lies somewhere in between the two extremes. I think the acting was great - except for the overacting moments. I though the beginning was horrible, especially the opening sequence with over the rainbow. It was so bad. Everything after Sharon Stone's interview felt tacked on. It should have ended with her. In between it accomplished a few good things. But there were sooo many characters and changes in the end, the movie is about Justin Timberlake(who was great) character and the kidnapped kid. I think aside from the initial establishing of the ""gang"" the acting was great and was the ONLY reason the movie succeeded. I honestly think it was HORRIBLY directed. The cinematography was just as bad and was awkward (like the shot of a truck speeding towards the camera on an empty highway) If a director like Alfonso Cuaron would have directed I think it would have been unforgettable. But in its current state its pretty much a even mixture of art and crap.",Alpha Dog
268,Lscivichatch92,Fell asleep,1,14 January 2007,"Wow, in my years of going to the movies, I have never fallen asleep during one. Im sorry but the first hour of this movie was by far the most pointless, awful crap that I have ever laid my eyes upon, and yes I have seen ""The Hills Have Eyes"". The beginning just made me want to get up and leave so bad I had to fall asleep to avoid doing so. I will admit, Justin Timberlake's character was very convincing toward the last 30 mins, since of course thats the only part I cared to watch. He saved this movie for me. Other than that, I could care less about the ebonics dialogue or the constant potsmoking throughout the movie or even the fact that you're left with a GIANT plot hole dealing with what happened to dudemans Older Brother. All in all, this was a horrible movie and I cant even believe I paid to see it.",Alpha Dog
269,shoelessdaishi,"Not the best, but not the worst...",8,12 January 2007,"Reading others comments and critics' reviews, I went into the screening with a bit of fear that it would just be another Hollywood mock-up of some lame event, but that wasn't true at all. I am a current film student and have seen more movies than most on this very site can claim, and a lot of good movies have come out, but even more bad ones. I look for how well a character meshes with the movie, not necessarily the acting skill, and to comment on Justin Timberlake (hating the man, myself, having been put through hours of torture thanks to 'NSYNC and my sister), he sold me. It definitely wasn't an Oscar performance, but the part was played just fine. As for the rest of the actors, it flowed very smoothly and had me close to the edge of my seat. The storyline was a true one, so hard to mess up, and if it weren't interesting, a movie would not have been made out of it. Just remember that just because a movie doesn't challenge your brain, doesn't mean it isn't a good movie. If you are looking for a movie that is well-casted, well-written, and well-directed, go see it, but if you are a ridiculously biased, close-minded idiot that can't form valid opinions, then rent a Veggietales flick and stay at home.",Alpha Dog
270,elcamino0969,Wellll.......i accidentally loved it.,7,12 January 2007,"Being a huge Justin timberlake fan of course i went to see it. I didn't expect much but some laughs from his character and I definitely got just that. The story line is decent but I swear I've seen this movie so many times, just different movie titles. Durring the movie there was little character development which was confusing and any serious movie freak would definitely not be in favor of it. However it all tied in eventually. The writing was pretty bad but I still loved it and had a tear when a ""certain event"" happened, that I already knew would. If you want to see this movie, don't see the trailer!!!! Anyways..not a lot happens and it could have been done better....but snaps for Justin for being a surprisingly good actor!!",Alpha Dog
271,locoidioto89,Pretty Sweet Movie Experience,9,16 January 2007,"I went to this movie because I thought it looked pretty entertaining, and I had heard it was good from a friend. After watching this film I'm glad I paid to see it in the theaters, I was getting emotionally attached to the characters and I also think that Justin Timberlake played his role amazingly. In the Climax scene I wanted to punch him in the face because he played that role so realistically, And I absolutely loved the guy who played Jake Mazursky. I sincerely thought he was on drugs the entire time, he played it so amazingly I could laugh at him but I was frightened at the same time. The kid who played Zack Mazursky ""Stolen Boy"" did an amazing job I got attached to him and didn't want anything to happen to him. Granted I didn't cry when he died, but the girl that came with me balled. Overall it was a great movie experience.",Alpha Dog
272,chriskringle,Great movie,9,7 February 2007,"I have also seen this movie 2 times and it got even better. I have gained a new respect for Justin Timberlake. I mean it wasn't a role you had to stretch much for, but nonetheless he played it good. I just found the whole movie to be very interesting and entertaining. Emile Hirsch was good as always, and you have the star power of Willis and Stone. Their minor roles were good cause they didn't overpower the film and you could focus on the real story.As well, this movie has some really funny dialog too!Great cast, intriguing story, good soundtrack.Go see this one, best of 2007 so far!!Regrets to the people who actually lived it",Alpha Dog
273,jodeeb85,"Awesome, awesome, awesome!",10,14 January 2007,"Seriously, going to see a movie that you don't have high expectations for and then coming out being blown away is awesome. This movie shows what real life is about. They had to make a choice. They made it and they had to live with it. Justin Timberlake's role was amazing. He completely amazed me by how wonderful he did. I will definitely see any Timberlake movie from now on. Amazing movie. Really. I will recommend this movie to everyone I know. I hope it does extremely well for it's first week at the box office because these actors deserve it 100%! I've never see any other Nick Cassavetes movies but after seeing this one I'm definitely going to be looking him up. Go see it. I dare you!",Alpha Dog
274,sassygurljrt,Alpha dog was Fuc**** awesome!!,10,14 January 2007,"I have to say this is one of the best movies i have seen. The couldn't have picked a better cast for it. For all of you that doubt Justin Timberlakes acting. Need to see this Movie. He is great. Especially at the end when they kill that kid he's crying while he tapes him up. I cried it was sad. But All around the movie was funny,sad,and serious. I definitely Recommend this movie to everyone. I cant wait till Black Snake Moan comes out. I don't care who disses this movie Go see it for ur self. Don't just go by What some ""critics"" say they just get payed to give their opinion. anyone can do that. Neways God see Alpha Dog. Im gonna buy it when it comes out on DVD",Alpha Dog
275,filmsJesus,this film takes itself too seriously,1,25 June 2006,"I saw this film at Sundance and was so disappointed with the direction and writing, I can't express it enough! The trailer made to promote Alpha Dog is amazing- please don't let it fool you. My first problem was that it had too much detail revealed in the dialogue, subtitles (which were never necessary to the plot), and too many characters to keep up with- making the film so long. I highly doubt the theatrical release will have the same time frame as it did in Park City. Mr. Cassevetes was trying to shock and touch an audience at the same time,which doesn't work in my opinion. All the characters in the story cuss like gangsters, leaving little room for characters' individuality. Especially when Anton Yelchin's character is supposed to be a juxtapose of the corrupt druggies that surround him. He looks different but talks exactly like them. His parents speak like this as well. Another writing problem is the lack of depth that is explored here- there are too many party scenes and not enough character developing ones. Justin Timberlake's character is the only one that slightly develops. The acting is directed to be too over-the-top, and comes across as very unbelievable. All the actors freak out continuously throughout the film for various reasons, screaming their lungs out like children. It becomes aggravating. In fact, at the screening I was in, the audience would laugh at parts like this because it seemed way too ridiculous. I won't give it away for those who care, but know that whether some plot elements are based on fact or creativity, there are many areas which are unbelievable and overemphasized. There is however some entertainment value to it I'll give the film that-the relationship between Anton and Justin's roles is very special, but overall, Alpha Dog did not belong at the Sundance Film Festival. It was very out-of-place there, and you'd know what I mean if you've ever seen a Sundance film, or have been to the festival before. Please don't give in to the hype that is about to come....",Alpha Dog
276,Clinto_theplaceholder,Don't waste your money.,1,14 January 2007,"I wish I could select a minus rating for this film because of its terrible acting (what was with JT, how much did he have to PAY the director to get his little short piece near the end). Bruce Willis had 3 minutes screen time max, and he was fine but he could have just done the lines why walking down the street and talking on a cell phone, his lines didn't really mean much considering his character was so minor. The other characters acting felt shallow and lifeless, you know everyone who went to see this saw it because of JT. That's all. The Cinematography was pointless, showing nothing, when it tried to be innovative, it slipped in to pointlessness. The doubling of camera angles was annoying more than anything, considering the rest of the film was shot in standard Hollywood cinematography, this was nothing special. Also, it was incredibly long, considering its subject matter, it could have cut it down even more. It wasn't even worth the paper the ticket was printed on. Sure there were some funny moments, but they were very very very few, and very far between. I think Cassavettes didn't put ""BASED ON A TRUE STORY"" in the opening credits because then people would think it was a decent movie. It wasn't, don't waste your money, or your time, watch something more intelligent. I kept waiting for this movie to have some sort of redeeming quality, but the only think that redeemed it was the lights flicking on at the end of the film, and the whole crowd sighing with relief that such a shallow, unintelligent, uninspired film was over.",Alpha Dog
277,PalJoey2426,know what your talking about,10,13 January 2007,"All these reviews and comments are getting me sick. Everyone is looking at this movie the wrong way. It's an entertaining satorical piece and the study of so many demestic and social elements. This movie is much more deeper than everyone realizes. To name only some of the themes in this movie would include: self-image, brotherhood, friendship, loyalty, parenting, demestic support. The director/writer did such a good job making this movie entertaining, yet valued at an intellectual level. Justin Timberlake is repetevily criticized for trying to look and act tough. Well his character is trying to look and act tough, but really isn't. In so many scenes do we see reputation and self-image (willis trying to get his son to make the call, johnny truelove attempting to break into foster's house) get in the way of moral value. Rethink this movie over, look deeper into it, and then try and evaluate it the right way. If you can't handle this movie then next time see a movie like Prime Evil.",Alpha Dog
278,j-nicole,I thought it was great.,10,12 January 2007,"Despite the first 5 minute music montage (which is enough to make someone walk out)... I understand that it was for the families of the characters in the film. However, once the movie begins, it doesn't stop until the end. Ben Foster is awesome, and Justin Timberlake gives one of the better performance in the film. All in all, I think it was very well done, though I expected more from Emile Hirsch. The only thing that I didn't like were some of the split-screen edits. Not necessary, and pretentious. The movie is good enough on its own. The end of it is just absolutely heartbreaking. But I think people are being unneccesarily too hard on this movie.",Alpha Dog
279,mbridgetj,I was surprised,8,29 January 2007,I have wanted to see this movie since last January when I watched them talk about it being shown at Sundance. I wanted to see it because I am a big fan of Emile Hirsch. I though however it wasn't going to be very good when I heard that Justin Timberlake was going to be a semi-gangster. When I went to the movie I was pleasantly surprised with his acting. He might actually have an acting career in front of him as well as the kid who played Zach (for the life of me cant remember his name know. I however did not care for that acting of Sharon Stone I thought she was horrible. The scene in fat suit should have made the audience cry instead I think it just made people uncomfortable. Overall I would say go see it.,Alpha Dog
