0,Leofwine_draca,Watch it for Octavia Spencer,6,12 October 2020,"This low budget (by Hollywood standards, anyway) production from Blumhouse is a return to the psycho-thrillers of old, essaying a fine performance from Octavia Spencer as a more realistic and believable villain than many. In some ways the plot is slightly reminiscent of THE CHANT OF JIMMIE BLACKSMITH albeit transplanted to modern times, although of course in all other respects this doesn't even come close to approaching the power of that Aussie classic. MA is a film which I'd call good rather than great. Spencer is excellent, the rest of the characters either uninteresting or unlikeable, particularly the stock American teenagers. I did like the slow burn approach which makes the climax all the more shocking.",Ma
1,SnoopyStyle,various problem,5,31 October 2020,"New high school transfer student Maggie Thompson (Diana Silvers) lives with her mother Erica (Juliette Lewis) who moved back to her home town after various failures to work as a casino waitress. Maggie is befriended by Haley (McKaley Miller) and her friends. They try to recruit adults to buy them beer and Sue Ann (Octavia Spencer) agrees. Later, she invites them to party at her house and it becomes a student hot spot. She asks them to call her Ma.This could be a functional horror movie. I can see a crazy Octavia Spencer turning on a group of hapless teens. It doesn't work here for a variety of reasons. It tries to slow burn the story. It tries to have another layer with her daughter. It tries to explain her by giving her a history. The ending has a lot of bad decisions and bad turns. Octavia is giving it all into the role but it's a top price steak in a sour stew.",Ma
2,claudio_carvalho,Overrated Reviews in IMDb,6,14 October 2019,"The 16 year-old Maggie (Diana Silvers) and her mother Erica (Juliette Lewis) move from San Diego to a small town in the Mississippi to start a new life. Soon Maggie befriends a group of teenagers from the high-school and together they befriend the nice Sue Ann (Octavia Spencer), who works at the local pet shop. She invites the teenagers to drink and party at her house but what they do not know is that Sue Ann is a psychotic woman that is plotting a revenge.""Ma"" is a reasonable thriller but with many overrated reviews in IMDb. The plot is unoriginal and predictable with the combination of insanity due to a humiliation of the psychotic lead character and revenge. The screenplay never surprises and is full of cliches. However entertains and is worthwhile watching with lower expectations if the viewer does not have a better option. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Ma""",Ma
3,kosmasp,Best/worst Ma,6,25 September 2019,"Yes this is predictable and I reckon it has some merits, like the main actress trying her best to make her character as relatable as possible. It is also way over the top, if you can even put a meter on how far out this goes at times. Something you may dislike completely or think is quite unique and quite nice.At first it creeps up on you, then it goes full mental (if you'll excuse the pun). There are things under the surface and there are reasons for the craziness, but not enough to make up or explain everything. Furthermore strands are left out in the open and characters are almost completely ""pushed"" aside/forgotten (one gets just mentioned in a random walk away and shouting about her - which does not explain why she just ... dissapears). Seen worse, seen way better too",Ma
4,jboothmillard,Ma,5,19 June 2019,"We have seen plenty of films like this, where a first seemingly nice woman slowly turns into a psychotic menace, I think I was mostly attracted to seeing this one because of some good people in the cast, and I do like these kinds of movies. Basically teenager Maggie Thompson (Diana Silvers) has moved to Ohio, with her mother Erica (Juliette Lewis) after her husband has left her. At her new school, Erica befriends Andy Hawkins (Corey Fogelmanis), Haley (McKaley Miller), Chaz (Gianni Paolo), and Darrell (Dante Brown), who invite her to drink with them. They convince Sue Ann Ellington (Octavia Spencer, also producing), a veterinary technician to help them buy alcohol. Sue Ann anonymously reports the teenagers' activities, but they are let go as the officer knows Andy's father, Ben (Luke Evans). The next day, Sue Ann invites the teens to drink in her basement and many people from school show up at her house to party, making Sue Ann popular among the students, they nickname her ""Ma"". Soon though her hospitality becomes annoying, as she continuously harasses them to engage in various activities with her. Maggie and Haley suspect that she stole jewellery from them during a party, so they go to her house to investigate. They are surprised by Genie (Tanyell Waivers), Sue Ann's daughter from a failed marriage, Maggie met her previously at school. Genie was believed to be a wheelchair user, but she is clearly able-bodied; she warns them as Sue Ann arrives home, and they narrowly escape. Ben, who is a relationship with another former school classmate, Mercedes (Missi Pyle), warns Sue Ann to stay away from his son. It is revealed in flashback that in high school, young Sue Ann (Kyanna Simone Simpson) had a crush on young Ben (Andrew Matthew Welch). She performed a blowjob on him in a closet, but it is revealed that she was tricked into performing it on another boy without knowing, she is a victim of rape by deception, and Ben had the entire school, including young Erica (Skyler) Joy and young Mercedes (Nicole Carpenter), witness the event, causing Sue Ann humiliation. Sue Ann has become increasingly unstable over the years, she sees Mercedes walking down the road, and deliberately runs her over in her car, killing her. She later lures Ben into her house, knocks him out, traps him on a bed, and pumps her body with the blood of Maggie's dog, Louie, killing him. The next day, the group goes to Sue Ann's house to celebrate Chaz's birthday, Maggie rushes to rescue them, but she discovers her friends have been drugged and finds Ben's body before Sue Ann knocks her unconscious. Maggie awakens trapped in the basement with her friends, while Sue Ann kills a police officer who arrives at the house. Sue Ann proceeds to press a hot iron on Chaz's stomach, sews Haley's mouth shut and paints Darrell's face white. Andy awakens and Sue Ann coaxes him into kissing her before stabbing him. She gathers the four around the sofa with her and makes Maggie take a photo of them together. She then attempts to hang Maggie before Genie intervenes, inadvertently creating a fire in the process. Erica arrives in time to rescue Maggie and her friends, but Sue Ann attempts to throw Genie into the fire, blaming Erica for not stopping Ben. Maggie stabs Sue Ann and frees Genie, Sue Ann accepts her fate, walks upstairs as the house burns, and lies down next to Ben's body. Also starring Allison Janney as Doctor Brooks, and Tate Taylor as Officer Grainger. Spencer certainly makes an impression as the strange middle-aged woman who slowly becomes psychopathic, appearing to help youngsters with their boozy bashes, but actually has a murderous revenge plan, Lewis and Evans do fine in their parts, Janney doesn't do much at all, I knew what sort of things to expect, it is predictable, it is also uneven in tone at times, but it is amusing, either purposely or not, and the shocks sort of keep things going, overall it's a reasonable psychological horror. Worth watching!",Ma
5,BA_Harrison,Ma. Sub-par.,4,31 May 2019,"Considering the popularity of Get Out and Us, I think we're going to be seeing a lot more horror films with prominent roles for black actors. I sure hope they're better than this latest offering from producers Blumhouse: Ma is tired and predictable, stretches plausibility, and, worst of all, is not in the least bit scary.The intended subject of terror is an overweight middle-aged woman named Sue Ann (Octavia Spencer) who befriends a group of high-school students, allowing them to party in the basement of her house in the middle of nowhere. But Ma, as Sue Ann is called by the kids, has a secret agenda, one that anyone versed in horror movies will have no problem guessing.Ma borrows heavily from both Carrie and Misery, Sue Ann being part Carrie White (mercilessly bullied at school by her peers) and part Annie Wilkes (nutty plump female psycho, handy with a syringe), but nowhere near as effective as either. Spencer tries her best to instill a sense of fear in the viewer, but the trite nature of the plot-hole ridden script, the pedestrian direction, and the plodding pace rob the film of any tension.I have no doubt that if it hadn't been for the massive box-office success of Us, we would have seen Ma going straight to DVD/streaming service.4/10, although I nearly dropped it down to 3/10 for having the nerve to steal the 'ornaments in the wrong place' plot device from Misery, and not even do anything of note with it.",Ma
6,paul_haakonsen,So much potential washed down the drain by a horrible ending and a lousy reveal of the storyline...,5,19 August 2019,"I had no idea what I was getting into when I sat down to watch the 2019 movie ""Ma"" from writer Scotty Landes and director Tate Taylor. But I read the movie's synopsis and it sounded interesting. So I took the time to sit down and watch it.Let me say, first of all, that ""Ma"" is actually an entertaining movie, but it has an odd level of absurdity and oddity to it, which might not actually fall into everyone's taste. I enjoyed it.The storyline was good, well for the most parts at least. I felt that most of the characters weren't explored enough throughout the course of the movie, which left me wanting more. I wanted more of backgrounds and such on the characters.And they had a good ensemble of actors and actresses to perform in the movie. Octavia Spencer really performed quite well and she was so nicely cast for the role, and she brought a lot of charm and enjoyment to the movie with her performance. Then you have Juliette Lewis, whom was not utilized enough, because her talent could have spruced up the movie phenomenally.I said most of the storyline was good, and it was. Right up to the point where it becomes revealed what is going on in the movie and why Sue Ann is behaving like she is. From that point on, the movie just took a stupid turn, and everything that was built up before that point was flushed away. And then the movie ends with a very, very anti-climatic ending that just felt like a slap to the face with a cold, dead fish. That ending was atrocious, hence the mediocre rating of five out of ten stars from me.This movie had potential, lots and lots of potential, but it all came tumbling down as the big reveal of the driving force of the storyline came unfolded on the screen. A shame really, because up to that point then the movie was really interesting and good.""Ma"" is a good movie, entertaining and enjoyable. Just a shame that the ending and the main reason behind the storyline was just utter rubbish.",Ma
7,BandSAboutMovies,Better than expected from a Blumhouse film,8,30 June 2019,"I tend to gravitate toward the exploitation and horror films of the 1970's, when situations would make no sense in movies that couldn't really be classified as anything other than weird. So it's kind of my dream that a movie like Ma was made in 1974 by S. F. Brownrigg, because then the people next to me who were shocked by how strange it got would be absolutely horrified by just how out of control it could get. That said, by 2019 standards, this was a pretty fine film.Maggie Thompson (Diane Silvers from Booksmart) and her mother Erica (Juliette Lewis, who has been dependably turning out character actor roles for the last few years) have moved back to Ohio after Erica abandons them. Maggie quickly makes new friends who do the only thing there is to do in a small town - drinks and drugs. Trust me - I grew up 15 minutes from Youngstown. All I did was sit in my room, watch horror movies and drink. Then again, that sounds like heaven, so I'm kind of glad I never had a circle of friends like the one in this film that would force me to go outside.But I digress - the teens soon meet Sue Ann Ellington (Octavia Spencer, who pretty much makes this movie worth watching singlehandedly), a vet tech who they convince to buy them alcohol. Look for Allison Janney in a cameo as her boss.Soon, they're drinking in her basement, which becomes fully furnished over time and more popular with other students. That said, Ma is that special personality that wants more and more over time, leading the students to stop spending so much time with her, particularly after they suspect her of stealing jewelry and personal effects. And oh yeah - Ma has Munchausen syndrome by proxy and a young daughter named Genie who may or may not really need her wheelchair.This is when we learn the real secret of Ma, Slaughter High-style. Back when Ma was just Sue Ann, she had been the shy kid who was the target of a cruel prank by the parents of the children she's befriending today. She had been in love with Andy's father Ben - played today by Luke Evans - but the group had switched him out for a geeky boy in a dark closet, making fun of her for giving him, shall we say, a little bit of neckboning.Ma is driven over the edge now, murdering Ben's girlfriend Mercedes with her car - a scene that caused gasps from the car next to us - as well as attacking Maggie's dog and using its blood to replace Ben's blood before slicing his wrists. I have no idea what that last one is about, but the scene of her holding his member and threatening to castrate him also upset people. This is where the film descends into madness and I, for one, could not have been happier.Our villainous middle-aged woman then traps the entire group in the basement, forcing them all to endure a series of tortures, like sewing a girl's mouth shut, ironing a boy's abs and then painting the token black friend white, whispering, ""They only need one of us."" Whew!I don't want to give away the final scene, but it was so perfect that I started laughing out loud, impressed with the audaciousness of the filmmakers. Well done!Ma was made because of director Tate Taylor's (The Help, Girl On the Train) desire to direct a film about ""something CENSORED up. After meeting with Spencer and learning that she was sick of the same roles and never getting to be a lead, he started looking for a project. Upon meeting with Jason Bloom, he read the Scotty Landes script for this film and decided to make the film.Although the original script was written with a white woman - with no sympathy or back story - in the title role, Taylor immediately thought of Spencer for the role of Ma. He called her, asked if she wanted to be in a horror movie and she said yes without even reading the script.",Ma
8,michaelRokeefe,Life and death of the party,7,19 November 2019,"Sue Ann (Octavia Spenser) is a lonely middle-age woman married to her job as a veterinary tech.

9,george.schmidt,Spencer stretches her acting muscles in this disjointed horror flick,7,14 June 2019,"MA (2019) ** Octavia Spencer, Diana Silvers, Juliette Lewis, McKaley Miller, Corey Fogelmanis, Gianni Paolo, Dante Brown, Tanyell Waivers, Dominic Burgess, Heather Marie Pate, Tate Taylor, Luke Evans, Margaret Fegan, Missi Pyle, Allison Janney, Kyanna Simone Simpson. Disjointed horror film that showcases Spencer's darker side as a put-upon middle-age woman who unlikely becomes the friend of a group of teenagers who use her cellar as a joint to get lit up in. While the actress stretches her muscles with her disturbed character the plotting is predictable (echoes of A Nightmare On Elm Street and even Psycho to lift from a few chillers) no thanks to Scotty Landes' so-so screenplay and not-too-scary direction from Tate Taylor.",Ma
10,view_and_review,Character and Performance Akin to Kathy Bates in Misery,7,12 June 2019,"A group of partying teens seem to have struck illegal booze pay dirt when they get an older woman to buy alcohol for them. But wait there's more... she also offers up her basement for their illicit activities. Certainly they don't think it's all NSA (that would be ""no strings attached"" not the ""National Security Agency""). Of course there were strings attached as they found out they couldn't get rid of this crazy woman.Octavia Spencer delivers a performance that puts her close to Kathy Bates in Misery. She is certified nuts and, as much as she was the antagonist, it was hard to fully hate her. Her backstory had something to do with that but also just her. She was so pitiful and lonely that it was hard to rage at her for her psychotic behavior.In another movie Ma (Octavia Spencer) would've been the star: an easygoing motherly type that lets teens experiment but also parts wisdom and guidance upon them to help them find their way. But this wasn't that type of movie though it could have been. Instead we got the psychopath version and I'm OK with that.",Ma
11,neil-476,Decent,7,10 June 2019,"In a small down-at-heel town, a middle-aged woman provides her basement as a venue for local underage highschoolers to get drunk.We learn early on that, for all her bonhomie and helpfulness in facilitating underage drinking, Sue-Anne aka Ma has her own agenda for helping out these teens. Octovia Spencer, playing both with and against type at the same time has a nice line in dark and brooding glances as the plot and backstory both unwind.This is a predictable story with some unpredictable wrinkles in it. Ma is a pleasing character - a monster who you sympathise with. And Ms Spencer is as good as always, in an unsettling role.This is more a dark psychological thriller than a horror movie - it sits in a shared borderland. It's quite good.",Ma
12,mm-39,"Better the expected, like a good movie of the week!",6,3 November 2021,"This story has to be based on real life, like the old C B S and A BC''s movies of the week. The woke kill the movie script was left out, and there was some real life people with real life stupidity in Ma. The macro story is a dead end industrial town with real life losers who make bad life choices, and it's the kids who pay. Everyone remembers the too old adult who hangs out with the kid and this is Ma! Ma does not have pandering social message. Was Ma a troubled girl who was isolate and the past broke her, or was she already un balanced and just made a series of bad choices? Ma lets the viewer decide. The details of the characters that never grew up, have dead end jobs and hang out at the casino, drinking and not being parents make good story development. The at risk kid with parents with no time because of work and or irresponsibility are vulnerable because the lack of parental guidance. The viewer see the script reveal such by the experience of a 16 year old girl who is smarter than the rest, but falls into the trap. Mid point of the movies has Ma snap, and we see she repeats the same over the top movie of the week news headlines, but mixed with a good message of how Ma has the same destructive parenting behavior on her own daughter. Can the kid's break the
bad choices cycle. Better then expected 6 stars.",Ma
13,thesar-2,Ma May I?,7,18 October 2019,"(Quickie Review.) Like SOOOO many Best Picture winners and nominees, Octavia Spencer continues her streak of saving movies. I simply adore her and loved her in EVERY SINGLE ROLE I've seen her in, even in the abysmal Rob Zombie's Halloween II. To date, I've never grown tired of her and I don't see that changing any time soon. So, we have Ma, a movie that's more about psychology than horror. This is touted as a horror movie, but I never saw it as such. It's just deep dive into a troubled single woman's mental health outcry when she tries to strangely connect to kids decades younger than herself. The movie's well shot, interesting, recommended and, again, saved by the real Ma, herself, Miss Spencer.",Ma

15,MOscarbradley,Spencer lifts this to a level it probably doesn't deserve.,7,19 April 2020,"We've been here a hundred times before and yet this kind of schlock-horror is still ridiculously entertaining even if the taste it leaves can usually turn more than a little sour. You know the story; sad, lonely and obviously psychopathic female befriends flathunter/new mom/injured writer or in this case, a group of horny teens and then makes their life hell. Here she's outwardly sweet, if much too accomodating, Octavia Spencer, ""Ma"" as she becomes known to the boys and girls she takes under her wing and she'll go to any lengths to keep them close.Tate Taylor, who directed Spencer to an Oscar in ""The Help"", has fun with the over-familiar material and Spencer milks it for all its worth; the teens are fine and other grown-ups include Luke Evans, (one of the dads), Juliette Lewis, (now old enough to be one of the moms), and Allison Janney as Spencer's hard-as-nails employer. There's nothing new here but it's good to see a teen-orientated chiller that's not founded on the supernatural and even if we are invited to stick the knife in Ma by the film's end, Spencer's gloriously over-the-top performance goes a long way to lifting this a notch or two out of the ordinary.",Ma
16,Edvis-1997,8,8,25 August 2019,"Pretty dope movie hardly to call it horror but still very nice. Plot was interesting with some holes but as 2019 it's one of the best movies so far. Actors were amazing , they did their parts amazing. Worth to watch.",Ma
17,Pjtaylor-96-138044,You mother...,5,11 June 2019,"There's this quite disconcerting trend within Hollywood to present victims of abuse as villains, and having their tragic pasts be the specific reasons for their present misdeeds, which is made more troublesome since these films go to great lengths to make their characters properly 'evil' - if somewhat sympathetic - in order to allow for a response somewhere along the lines of ""yeah, their childhood was messed up but it doesn't excuse this"". In reality, victims of abuse are far more likely to be abused again then they are to turn into psychopathic killers, whether or not they suffer long-term damage. Obviously, there are some cases where people perform vile actions and attribute them to their prior suffering - an excuse which, ultimately, doesn't fly - but these are far rarer than our media would have you believe. This issue is, essentially, at the heart of 'Ma (2019)', as the flick itself doesn't quite know how to treat its eponymous antagonist. Ultimately, it does portray her as a villain, despite some attempts to make her sympathetic. However, it doesn't portray her as a villain particularly well as, even though you're always guessing what she's up to, that's only because it doesn't seem like she even knows. The picture itself flip-flops from presenting her as conflicted but possibly well-meaning to straight-up conniving, sometimes between consecutive scenes. Her character motivation is all over the place, ever in flux until it really escalates from zero to ten in a matter of minutes. This problem actually plagues a number of individuals on screen, even leading to a rather (unintentionally) humorous bar-set scene, and makes for a strange viewing experience. The majority of the movie consists of teens getting drunk in Ma's basement, with the occasional false jump scare or odd creepy moment tossed in to make sure the audience stays awake. There never really seems to be a sense of true escalation, until there suddenly is, and there isn't a proper feeling of causation, either. Of course, scenes tend to flow into one another and, broadly, the whole thing makes sense. It's just that certain plans feel a bit nonsensical and some characters are a tad superfluous, as well as oddly interacted with. The feature doesn't really have a grasp on its themes, either. I mean, they're there sort of under the surface but they don't really come to fruition - despite being obvious - and the final moment of, I suppose, catharsis feels unearned because it isn't built up to in any significant fashion. Generally, the movie isn't boring. It's never exactly entertaining, though, and it only engages in the most basic of ways. It's not terrible, just sort of average. 5/10.",Ma
18,bowmanblue,'Misery' with cellphones,8,30 June 2020,"Sometimes the most simple of films are actually the best ones. Here, if you ignore there is a little similarity or two to the classic Stephen King adaptation of 'Misery,' you have a bunch of teens who befriend an older lady when she agrees to buy them alcohol. However, they end up getting more than just a few bottles of underage grog for their troubles.There may be nothing new with the way this film is put together, somehow everything just works. For a start, the script is great. The sort of tale where a girl moves to a new town could be riddles with all sorts of filmic cliches, yet this one doesn't go that way. There's no love triange, no bitchy cool girl or meat-headed 'jock.' What you get is a group of friends who talks to each other as if they really were friends, therefore automatically letting us - the audience - root and relate with them.Of course, I'm totally underplaying the excellent performance of Octavia Spencer as the titular 'Ma,' who offers to help these teens party with the purchase of alcohol. She steals every scene, but, despite being the 'villain' of the film, her ability to make us understand where she's coming from and how she became the way she is just makes her character more than some sort of one-dimensional masked slasher we get in so many other horror films.Despite the story not really going in too many novel directions, I'll keep the plot vague in case you don't guess where some of it is going. However, if you want a 'horror' film that's probably more of a thriller than an outright blood-bath (although there are more than a few really grim moments that will make most men wince!) then definitely give it a go. It's got excellent performances all round, some nice tweaks that you may not see coming, quite a few digs at the drawbacks of popular culture (mainly allowing so much of your own information to be viewed online by anyone) and just the one blatant nod to 'Misery' in the form of an ornamental cat.",Ma
19,ThomasDrufke,"Silvers is a Star, Spencer is Great, But that's All You Get Here",6,5 June 2019,"I really do love that Blumhouse is getting to the point where they can bring in A-list actors for roles that used to go to b-movie level actors. Octavia Spencer as the main villain in a horror film? That's about as good as you can get. Diana Silvers is just about the only young actor who presents good work here, but perhaps that's the script's fault. And 'Ma' is certainly creepy and contains genuinely unsettling scenes, in the same vein as Kathy Bates in Misery, but ultimately I think the film ends up focusing more on delivering shock and horror rather than character work with something 'to say'. If that's your jam, then I'm sure you'll find a lot to enjoy with 'Ma'. Otherwise, it becomes much more forgettable then it should have been.

21,Cineanalyst,Misery-able Mammy,3,3 October 2019,"""Misery"" (1990) is the film that ""Ma"" is most an imitation of. The self-referential business of ""Misery,"" where a reader assaulted the writer, however, is muddled here. Instead, Ma is trying to rewrite her past, hanging out with teenagers getting wasted, and including by rearranging school yearbook photographs. Perhaps, something cinematic could've been done here with the photography and smart-phone videos, but isn't. What there is a dull build-up to not much of anything interesting. That it also doesn't provide much in the way of producing usual horror-movie physical reactions seems secondary to me; it's that nothing especially clever is done, either, that's its main fault.Octavia Spencer does offer another twist on the Mammy trope, as she was Oscar-awarded for doing in ""The Help"" (2011) (also directed by Tate Taylor), with her here serving mostly-white children. There's no struggle for narrative control here as with Kathy Bates and James Caan's characters in ""Misery,"" though; Spencer carries this one. Meanwhile, the talents of the likes of Allison Janney and Juliette Lewis are squandered. Oh well, ""Ma"" could've been better; at least, it was copying another film that did do something self-referentially intriguing.",Ma

25,cruise01,Decent thrills but great performance from Octavia Spencer.,6,5 September 2019,"Ma (3 out of 5 stars).Ma is a decent horror thriller film which Octavia Spencer delivers playing the creepiest character ever but the film's direction is uneven, dull, and it just lacks the energy to carrying out this thriller.The plot follows Ma (Octavia Spencer) which she buys alcohol for teenagers Maggie (Diana Silvers) and her friends. She also invites them to party in her basement. When Ma's behavior gets worse when they are trying to distant themselves with her. Her behavior gets out of control.It is a good psychological thriller. Ma who is suffering from the traumatic events of her past such as being bullied and humiliated. Which she sees her adult classmates and their teenage kids lurking around.The direction gets lost with losing its suspense and thrills. It is a little dull and boring in moments. The characters are uninteresting. The teenagers are written to be stupid characters in the movie. The film does set a very good unsettling disturbing feeling.

How far you have fallen since 'The Help'. What could've been an outlandish psychological thriller, fully realising its ludicrous premise, turns out to be a shambolic mess. Literarily, tonally, and dramatically speaking, nearly every aspect failed to glue together. All thanks to Landes and Taylor's utterly atrocious screenplay. What should've been a powerful adhesive is in fact a weak Pritt Stick that Ma uses to glue down her cutesy little photo album with.

But Ma isn't all that innocent, and hides a sinister objective that would threaten the lives of everyone.Octavia Spencer singlehandedly carried this entire ""thriller"" with her central antagonistic performance. The perfect balance of infectious fun, psychological deterioration and straight up bat *beep* crazy. She is able to turn from pleasant to creepy in just a second, and I for one had fun watching her in this type of role (I felt like she had fun too). An absolute travesty though that she is given toilet paper for a script and has to overwork it to deliver something remotely thrilling.The dialogue was unnatural. It's the best description I have! These friends talk like robots and exhume no real personalities. Example (and I'm para-phrasing): ""will you go out with me?"", ""sure. Why did it take you this long to ask?"", ""I didn't know to do it over text or in person!"", ""couldn't you tell I've been obsessed with you?"", ""now we're in love."". No one speaks like this. I get it, Taylor is moving things along at a rapid pace because let's be honest, no one cares for these students. But establishing a yawn-worthy romance for the sake of inserting stakes into this thriller, just seems pointless. If we didn't care for them to start with, hell, we shan't be caring for them now.The vast amount of clichés that are found in nearly every stalker film, are certainly utilised here. An incalculable amount of text messages in four seconds. Using social media to research these victims. Staring blankly out of the window because psycho woman is psychotic. And my personal favourite, predictably fractured family dynamics. Honestly, some of the weirdest family dynamics/relationships I've ever seen in film. Take Maggie and her mother. They talk as if they've never met before! Establishing their current work/school situation in the first five minutes, arguing and laughing together in the same conversation, never going to music festivals! It's so bizarre that I was left perplexed with these dialogue exchanges. Oh, and don't get me started on Genie. The most obvious plot device I've seen from a low-budget mainstream horror.Tonally, the film didn't work. It attempts to merge horror thrills with a light comedic undertone, which certainly had audiences in my cinema laughing, but left me irked. It was too forced, and again honing in on this idea of unnatural dynamics. Running over a jogger (great scene by the way) to then play a cheesy pop song isn't funny. It diminishes the impact of the thrills that Taylor had tried to plant.The acting, aside from Spencer and Evans (whenever on screen), was mediocre. The student actors look well over twenty. Evans, Pyle and Janney were all wasted. The film fortunately realises its premise in the last ten minutes, from ironing a stomach to sewing a mouth shut, but it's a little too late. The boredom had already crept in. Oh and finally, the scene with the prosthetic penis? Hilariously bad. Pretty sure I could see the plastic from my seat (and I wasn't particularly close).So yes, Ma is yet another disappointment from 2019. Not realising its hardcore outlandish premise was the biggest crime, the shoddy screenplay was the icing on the mouldy cake. Atleast Ma can throw a damn decent party, minus those famous Spencer death stares...",Ma
27,pmtelefon,Junk.,2,3 November 2019,"""Ma"" starts off like a Lifetime movie with curses. (That's not a knock on Lifetime movies. I watch a lot of them and even the bad ones are better than this movie.) But after a while, ""Ma"" leaves the R rated Lifetime road and gets lost between psychological drama and bad horror. Once it goes into the horror zone, it insults the audience with gore. ""Ma"" don't just get bloody, it goes down the ""Saw' type torture porn road. The last half hour of the movie kills any good will that was built up during the first hour. ""Ma"" is the pits.",Ma
28,southdavid,Mamma Mia !,5,29 April 2020,"Missed this at the cinema last year, but its recent arrival on Sky Movies gave me another opportunity. In retrospect, I'm sort of glad that I did miss it, as I'm a bit more forgiving about movies at home than I am having paid for the big screen, and ""Ma"" and it's somewhat misleading marketing, probably annoyed a lot of people.Maggie (Diana Silvers) and her mother Erica (Juliette Lewis) move back to Erica's hometown following the breakdown of her marriage. Maggie makes some friends but soon discovers there is little to do in this town, other than drink out by some rocks. Trying to convince someone to buy them alcohol, they eventually ask Sue Ann (Octavia Spencer) who, though initial hesitant, agrees and after a couple more occasions offer them her basement as safer and more private party venue. But as Sue Ann ingratiates herself more and more into their lives, Maggie begins to suspect her motives.So, I suppose the first thing to say is that you're going to be disappointed if you're expecting a horror film. It's really more of a revenge thriller, than anything else. There are a couple of tense moments, with characters wandering around Sue Ann's house, but ultimately it's just not a horror, not a failed horror film, just never trying to be one.It does have some wonderful performances. Octavia Spencer is excellent, as is Juliette Lewis. There are glorified cameos from Alison Janney, Luke Evans and Missy Pyle that are good too, but it's the kids that are the real ones that stuck with me. It's very easy to fall into high school stereotypes but they avoid that and turn the kids into likable, realistic characters.Unfortunately those performances are in a film that isn't terrible, but isn't particularly memorable either. The escalations towards the end come too quickly, rather than feeling like a genuine escalation and it all leads to an anticlimactical conclusion.Not awful, but tough to actively recommend.",Ma

30,paul-allaer,Very disappointing--I thought this was supposed to be scary?,3,1 June 2019,"""Ma"" (2019 release; 99 min.) brings the story of Maggie and her HS friends, and Sue Ann. As the movie opens, Maggie and her mom arrive with their moving van somewhere in Ohio, Even though Maggie is new, she makes friends at school in no time. The ""Group of Five"" soon try to by alcohol, and eventually Sue Ann, a veterinary assistant who happens to walk by, agrees to buy the alcohol. More, Sue Ann suggest they hang out in her basement, and Maggie and her friends agree... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest Blumhouse Production, which has built a very strong niche for inexpensive but well-made scary and horror movies. This one is directed (and co-written) by Tate Taylor, who recently also gave us ""The Girl On the Train"". And last but not least, the movie's lead is none other than Octavia Spencer. When you take all elements into consideration, I felt reasonably certain that ""Ma"" might be worth checking out. Alas, I couldn't have been more wrong. From almost the get-go, things happen that are frankly implausible (5 high school kids accept invitation of complete stranger to ""hang out in the basement"", literally, and many more examples I will not mention so as not to spoil), In addition, there is nothing scary in the movie. I thought this was supposed to be scary movie? Octavia Spencer, bless her heart, tries the best that she can with the material that she is given (which isn't much). By the time we are an hour into the movie, I frankly had completely given up on this film, as I wasn't interested in any of the characters, and did I mention the movie isn't scary in the least? But I decided to stick it out until the very (bitter) end. I shouldn't have...""Ma"" opened wide this weekend. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great (about 15 people), although the picture perfect Spring weather may have been a factor. I cannot recommend ""may"" to anyone in good conscience, but of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Ma
31,jtindahouse,A complex villain and an incredible final act make for a pretty decent film,7,18 August 2019,"'Ma' was one of those movies where the trailer just kept coming up before every movie I would see in the cinema, to the point where I was sick of the film before I had even seen it. Nonetheless I finally got around to watching it, and I'm glad I did. The movie started out very much like what I was expecting based on my numerous views of the trailer. It felt very unoriginal and like a story I had seen a thousand times before. But then as the movie went along it began to present some original concepts, and by the time the credits rolled I was quite satisfied with the finished product.Octavia Spencer plays the villain in the film, and it is actually a really fascinating roll she has been given to work with. This isn't your average villain. There are levels of complexity here that you don't find in your average thriller. I kept swinging back and forth between being on her side, and hating her more than anything. The flashbacks used to create this conflict are excellently woven into the film, drip fed to the audience bit by bit, so we know just as much information as we need to at any given time.Around the midway point in the movie things were beginning to stall a little. I wasn't sure if the film had any tricks up its sleeve, so I begin to lose patience. I needn't have worried though, because the final third of the film things kick into gear big time. In fact the film gets shockingly dark. To the extent it really took me off guard. It went to some places I never saw coming, and I loved it. I had a surprisingly good time with 'Ma' and I think most that give it a chance will as well.",Ma

The acting is perhaps better than the material deserves, and this leads you to expect something other than the standard material you are left with.I think part of the problem is the structure. The movie introduces details too late, and doesn't really foreshadow, thus feeling like they made it up as they went along.Octavia Spencer, in the lead role as Ma, has gotten uniformly excellent notes in otherwise negative reviews, and I'm not really sure why. I was never scared of her like I was Kathy Bates in ""Misery"".I liked Diana Silvers, though. She was believable.",Ma

Diana and her new friends run into Octavia, who gets alcohol for them and offers her own house to the teens so that they will have a safe place to drink. Everything is fine, at first. But the teens soon find out that Octavia has some secrets-mostly shown through flashbacks-that make the teens question their judgement of thinking that Octavia is lonely and just wanting some company.

Yes, Octavia Spencer makes an incredible character that oozes personality and charisma and could have been an amazing hero in a different story but here is not only terrifying in that slow burning way that can sustain a movie but also commands a great deal of empathy as she is just as much a victim as a menace and at points it's not hard to actually root for her.They don't pull punches with this but they know how to draw the line too.My only real criticisms are the cardinal sin of saying the words ""scary"" out loud.",Ma

When MA unveils not-so-Big Ben as the key ingredient for her imminent wienie roast, the collective groan emitted by the audience in my theater topped the murmur elicited by THE HELP's climactic do-do dessert. Of course, many film fans will insist that there are other elements that should be required to garner high horror honors than simply grossing out viewers. They may cite a myriad of implausible elements incorporated into MA's plot, such as her seemingly unlimited financial resources despite apparently working out of pecuniary necessity in a demeaning position as a belittling veterinarian's orderly. On top of that, her 48- or 72-hour days include magical interior decorating marathons, endless stalking stake-outs that would make most private eyes envious, not to mention MA's work sessions at the vet's. But such carping may amount to wrong-headed nit-picking. Where else but at MA's can a film buff get such useful tips about ironing, painting, and sewing?",Ma

40,jimbo-53-186511,MA-rvellous,7,25 January 2021,"A woman befriends a group of teenagers by agreeing to buy them alcohol. All initially appears to be fine when the woman (whom they affectionately refer to as Ma) agrees to do this on multiple occasions and even agrees to let them party in the basement of her house. However, the euphoria is short-lived when Ma begins to start acting strangely and they soon realise that friendship is the last thing on Ma's mind...Ma is billed as a psycholgical thriller and it's fair to say that it certainly lives up to that tag; Ma's a pretty messed up woman, but through flashbacks the viewer is at least afforded an explanation as to what the driver is behind her increasingly unhinged behaviour. Although she chooses to get back at her old school peers (I won't use the word 'friends') through their children I think things run a little deeper than that - she actually befriends several other teenagers and to me it's like she's trying to have a life in the present that she wasn't able to have in the past. Perhaps it was just a bonus to her that some of the children she befriended happen to be children of those that she went to school with. Also the idea of her keeping Genie at home rather than allowing her to go to school could have been to try and protect her daughter from what she had been put through at school - although there's clearly a controlling element at play with Ma not allowing her daughter to venture downstairs.So Ma's character is clearly interesting from a psychological perspective which is a strength in itself, but Octavia Spencer manages to make Ma a pretty scary presence (this in spite of her small stature). What's perhaps more scary is how clever and resourceful she is meaning she nearly always has the upper hand on anyone that gets in her way.The finale is pretty tense and well-staged and some of the punishment that Ma inflicts on her victims is pretty sadistic and cruel. Naturally a lot of it is predictable, but what does that matter when it's so well-orchestrated?If I was to cast a cynical eye over this film then there are certainly one or two flaws; for a start, the narrative is a little contrived (all the parents kids have all grown up to be friends with each other and gone to the same school despite the fact that the parents have not seen each other for many years and one parent moved away from the area and came back in the intervening years). It's possible, but just a little too convenient. It's also not terribly original throwing in many different ingredients from the 'psycho female' archive.Having said that this film was entertaining and Octavia Spencer's performance was quite unnerving (in some ways she reminded me of Annie Wilkes from Misery) although she isn't quite as terrifying and her performance isn't quite up there with Kathy Bates. Still I think you'll be pleasantly suprised by how good this film is after watching it - I was shocked after watching it that its IMDB rating is only 5.6 - it's better than that.",Ma
41,Pairic,Good Horror Thriller,8,6 June 2019,"Ma: Teenagers do stupid things, in slasher films, even in this psychological horror thriller. Ma (Octavia Spencer) acts strange and gives enough warning signs for any rational person to avoid her. But when have 16 year olds ever been rational. I remember the days when Juliette Lewis was always a teen threatened by psychos bur now she is 40-something Erica who moves back to small town Ohio with her daughter Maggie (Diana Silvers). Maggie soon meets up with Andy (Corey Fogelmanis) and his friends. They meet middle-aged Ma who agrees to buy alcohol for the gang. Soon ma is hosting parties not just for them but for students from all over town.Ma is more than just a lonely older woman, from flashbacks we see she is carrying a grudge and a desire for vengeance for events which occurred decades ago. The threat, fear, and violence gradually build up so that when a shockingly violent event occurs you are less startled, like a lobster in slowly heating water you have become inured. But there are some shocking scenes in this film and it certainly isn't for the fainthearted. A failing is that too much of Ma's motivation is revealed or at least hinted at early on in the movie; it would also have helped if Ma's manipulative behaviour had been more implicit. Still a good thriller which morphs into frightening horror. Directed and co-written by Tate Taylor on a budget of only $5 million. 8/10.",Ma

The lead character, played by Diana Silvers, may not have had much characterization, but the actress' range of wide eyed facial expressions made up for it. There isn't much story, but I liked seeing this group of people deal with Ma's increasingly bizarre behavior.

Never getting a moment's notice to develop any character or truly memorable sequences, we are left w/a hodgepodge of horror film cliches which in this day & age may feel to some as retro or a throwback to simpler times but you have to back the claim you make.

Octavia Spencer leads the film is a convincing dark role, but poorly written one as well. Her character can be hard to watch at times, which isn't all bad I suppose when we are talking about a horror film, but its not unsettling in an enjoyable way, just in a way that makes you ask, why? The script is all over the place, from being a coming of age tale, to a revenge story, to a horror film, to so much else, and just none of it really works under the grim umbrella the director casts it under. It can be entertaining at times, but also a bit predictable. It has some intense moments, some relatable ones as well, but there is so much untapped potential in this largely mean and angry story, with absolutely no where to go. In the end, Ma is just another dud from Blumhouse, dark and creepy without a purpose, and to soon be forgotten.

50,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Dark Thriller with Deeper Story,8,1 June 2019,"This was a film that I had seen a few trailers for and I was intrigued to check it out. I've seen most films that come from Blumhouse, so this was another that I put on my list. I was even more interested when listening to a podcast the morning I checked it out with a producer on the film saying that it had some aspects that people didn't necessarily see coming. The synopsis is a lonely woman befriends a group of teenagers and decides to let them party at her house. Just when the kids think their luck couldn't get any better, things start happening that make them question the intention of their host.We start this off with a mother, Erica (Juliette Lewis), moving back to her hometown with her daughter Maggie (Diana Silvers). Her marriage fell apart and they are trying to make a new life for themselves. Erica gets a job at the local casino.Maggie goes to school and a boy makes eyes at her. His name Andy (Corey Fogelmanis), but he is talking with his friends. At lunch, she is approached by Haley (McKaley Miller), her boyfriend Chaz (Gianni Paolo), their friend Darrell (Dante Brown) as well as Andy. Haley puts her number in Maggie's phone and invites her to a party the following day. She has to decline as she is supposed to hang out with her mother.That falls through when she picks up a shift at work. Maggie joins her new friends and they try to buy alcohol. The party is canceled so they are going to go to a local rock quarry. They are struggling to get booze when Sue Ann (Octavia Spencer) walks by. The name on Andy's van catches her eye and she buys them stuff.They go back to her again to do the same thing, but she convinces them to drink in her basement. She just has a couple rules, which includes staying in the basement. They all have a good time, but Sue Ann is a bit off. She is dubbed Ma and she even likes it. Her basement becomes the new drinking spot in town.As Ma becomes more needy, we see there is a bit of history in this town and that it really has scarred her. Maggie doesn't want to go there anymore, but no matter what they do, Ma keeps showing up in their lives.Being in this a new movie, I don't want to go really into any spoilers here in my review. I was a bit leery about this film and wanted to see it to make my mind up. I have to admit, I was really surprised by it. I will watch most everything that Blumhouse pictures does, but I do have to admit, they have really been directing a lot of their films toward teens so I was glad to see this one going R-rated.As I kind of pointed out earlier, this film is deeper than I thought it was going to be. We do get that aspect of the film where Ma is becoming very needy. It is actually really creepy since these are all high school kids. There is a deeper story here though that makes sense and it actually makes her a bit of a tragic character, despite how psychotic she is. What makes it interesting as well is that it is misguided.For films like this, I do like that they incorporate not telling your parents things for fear of being in trouble. It really makes me think back to when I was younger and the things I would keep to myself for this reason. I do have to say though; these teens are a bit overdone. The hard liquor they are drinking with no problem isn't believable. This is really kind of a minor aspect, but it was something I really did notice.There is also something else that gets revealed in this film that I don't really think goes anywhere. I thought that an event we see in the past was going to explain it, but it doesn't. I'm not really sure why this character was there to be honest. It doesn't ruin the film, but I also feel like it is there for a convenience for the climax. The only other thing is to show insane Ma is would be the other aspect.Speaking of the climax, I do have to say that this film is paced well. It runs under 100 minutes and I never found myself bored. The other teens befriending Maggie happens a bit quick, but I'm fine not seeing her as a loner for too long. I do think that the tension builds at a solid clip and how things payoff was pretty solid as well. I wasn't expecting the climax to go where it did and I was down for it.To the acting of the film, I have to give it to Spencer. She really killed this role. I know she is a really good actress, but I love the range of emotions we get from her. She is tragic in dealing with the aspects of her past. I felt bad for her is that she is living through these teens. She is also scary when she snaps. She shifts through these in short time, which was pretty impessive too. I thought Silvers was solid. I'm not the biggest Lewis fan, but she did fine. Miller really stole my heart in this film though. She is quirky and I found to be quite cute. The other teens are solid. It was fun to see Luke Evans as Andy's father as well as Missi Pyle and Allison Janney making appearances. I think that the cast did really well and rounded out the film for what was needed.Something that actually really surprised me about the film was the effects. I didn't realize it was rated R and it didn't necessarily need it until the beginning of the third act. I have to say that the effects used looked to be practical and some of them actually had me cringing. There's not a lot, but definitely what we got was good. I also think that the film was shot very well.The final thing to touch on would be the soundtrack. There's a lot of older music that is playing at Ma's that I thought was a good touch. It is funny, because it is mostly from her era which would make sense. I do think we get some more mood setting songs as well, which definitely fit and help build the tension. I do think overall it is fine for what they were going for.Now with that said, I really did enjoy this film. What I saw from the trailers, I definitely had in mind what I thought this film would be. I got that, but it goes deeper in the story for sure. I think that the acting really helps bring that to life as well. It is paced well and builds tension to a really good climax. I wasn't expecting the effects we got, but they really help the film. The soundtrack was also solid in my opinion. I would definitely recommend giving this film a viewing as I feel this is a good film.",Ma

Ma is surprising in many ways in terms of its story telling, focusing more on the characters than the actual scares. Look closely and you will find this packed with a treasure trove of actors and actresses that will participate to varying degrees. For some it's merely a small cameo or background scene, while others will have a more direct involvement with the story. For those more integrated into the story, the acting is very good for a horror movie, crafting representative teenagers, concerned parents trying to recapture youth, and concerned parents well to make a believable ensemble. Yet, it's Octavia Spencer who brings everything together shaping Ma into a villain that is not so extreme to be laughable, and really capturing all the characteristics of the disturbed woman to the T. Bringing so much to the table in terms of energy, entertainment, and that pillar of strength the movie relies on, I loved the casting of this talented actress. Still, Ma's tale is also impressive based on how focused on the plot they were. This tale has layers to it, managing to spread the story through three sections in the form of the kids, their parents, and Ma, interweaving them to give a complete story that feels much like a book or television series. My friends and I agreed that the tale was realistic, which brought part of the fun experience, and in grounding it to the reality it made for a good villain that was engaging to watch.
Yet with a great story the movie sort of falters in the scare factors that come with this genre. We agreed that Ma is creepy, the realism and stalker obsession perfectly portrayed to make one feel uncomfortable. Sadly the scares could not live up to the promise of the trailers, focusing a little more on the dramatic dynamics than the scare factors. Much of this comes from the predictability of the movie, thanks in part to the trailers, but Ma just needed that last-minute finesse to smooth out the scares. In regards to the story elements, Ma plays well to its own rules, but at times begins to suspend the reality in regards to filling in the missing pieces. Ma's actions should have left some obvious clues for people to look, but those moments were ignored. That small nitpick aside, the movie's main drop off for me was the lack of suspenseful finish and the rushed ending that came with it. After all the planning, build up, and moving pieces, the ending did not quite have the epic finish I expected of Ma's insanity. Sure, much of it stuck to the character of Ma, but it just didn't have that epic conclusion I expect in this genre.
In regards to Ma, it's a pretty decent drama and thriller, but not so much in terms of a horror. Great character development and acting are the pinnacles of this movie with enough relevant issues to get many invested in the villain. However, if looking for the scary film, you are not going to get quite the suspenseful thriller you have been looking for. The movie is definitely more for the dramatic audience members who like the Freeform and Lifetime movies, but enjoy a little more grounded components to them. Nevertheless, the movie still has quality, but probably could be visited on a latter note at home. Thus my scores are:Horror/Thriller: 7.5
Movie Overall: 7.0",Ma
55,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Ma,7,1 June 2019,"""This never happened, OK"". But it did happen my friends and that's the unsettling part.Anyway, have you the reader ever seen a horror version of a John Hughes flick? Or better yet, have you ever checked out 2002's One Hour Photo or the villainous prose of Unlawful Entry (minus any police protocol)? I have in regards to the latter and Ma (my latest review) resembles those attributes.Ma, with its eager malaise and unpromising, small town feel, provides spot-on casting and the makings of something a la the midnight movie circuit. Octavia Spencer in Ma's lead role, gets her Kathy Bates on and becomes the badass, cinematic wretch terror fans have always yearned for. Ma's director (The Help's Tate Taylor) gives the film inching tension and envelope-pushing, R-rated fare. He gets almost everything right except the ending which seems implausible as to how much stabbing resilience (and fire immunity) a human being can take.Taking place in I guess, Ohio (I got that from a car's license plate), cropping out at 100 minutes, and containing an 80's-style soundtrack (hence the John Hughes reference), Ma chronicles one Sue Ann (Spencer). Sue Ann traumatized by her past and a bit of a lone wolf, befriends some free spirit, high school kids who want her to buy beer for them. Next thing you know they're hanging out in Sue Ann's basement and having cringed, wild parties. Sue Ann's behavior turns a little kooky, said high school kids reject her, and she ends up making their lives a living hell.Look for some mild twists and a woman getting run over by another woman to the sounds of Earth, Wind & Fire's ""September"" (you'll never think of that song the same way again). Also, look for privacy violated Facebook allocations, partial male genital nudity, and Scooby-Doo van musings. Bottom line: Ma is disturbingly upsetting, pseudo-Hitchcockian, and will give you the fresh, genre-ed creeps as you exit the theater. Somehow it all just works. Rating: 3 stars.",Ma
56,justin-fencsak,Another hit for Blumhouse,10,9 June 2019,"After seeing the trailer for Ma numerous times before R rated movies, I thought this movie would be soso...turned out it's very good watching. The pace is good yet short and the soundtrack is a mix of different decades of pop. Juliette Lewis is hot and so are the teenyboppers that are the victim of Octavia Spencer's title character of the same name. Go see this movie while it's in theatres..it will scare the living daylights out of you!!!",Ma
57,vengeance20,It was decent enough!,7,2 June 2019,"Seen this tonight & was thought it was pretty good. Not amazing, but pretty good!The story-line is simple & that's alright by my standards as complex story-lines can just confuse viewers rather than wow them, but it was easy enough to follow.The film follows a single mum moving back to her hometown with her 16 year old daughter. Being new in town, the daughter makes friends at her new school & while scouting for someone to buy their alcohol for them for a camp drink session they accidentally ask the person that'll make their lives hell for the rest of the film. Sue Ann, a black middle aged woman who got abused as a teenagers by the teens parents back in the day.So, the film just showcases the woman's obsessions & insecurities throughout as she begins to annoy and creep out the group. So much so, that they fall victim to her wrath.I found the film to be pretty good & suspenseful. It wasn't really gory, sadly, but it had enough gore I guess for a films of its type. The film kept you locked in till the bitter end. The actors did a great job and the sinister theme was ace.But I felt the film wasn't that great, maybe it didn't capture my interest I don't know. But I felt the film had a lot of implausibilities. Like how Sue Ann could get away with what she did? How could she think that? In a close knit community? Like seriously?Overall, a decent film! Not amazing, but decent! 7/10",Ma
58,elliotjeory,Awesome film,8,19 April 2020,I thought this film was an enjoyable psychological horror. Ma is the right amount of creepy and crazy. It's also funny in a dark way. Well made and not too long with a good supporting cast.,Ma
59,fntstcplnt,Ma (2019),5,16 January 2020,"Directed by Tate Taylor. Starring Octavia Spencer, Diana Silvers, Juliette Lewis, McKaley Miller, Corey Fogelmanis, Gianni Paolo, Luke Evans, Dante Brown, Missi Pyle, Tanyell Waivers, Dominic Burgess, Allison Janney. (R)Small town teens need a place to party and an adult that can get them the materials to do so; enter Sue Ann (Spencer), aka ""Ma,"" who lets the kids go crazy in her basement with booze by the case full, but something is quite clearly off about this bipolar enabler. Has all the setup for a truly unhinged, carnage-and-craziness-heavy thriller, with Spencer ready and willing to go full nutso, but aside from a few diabolically enjoyable moments (did anyone get that license plate number?), the film stays in first and second gear too often, resulting in a depressingly feckless finale. Ma's mood swings earn far more chuckles than chills, but they're still fun; a mostly anemic supporting cast is far less so (Janney is completely wasted in a throwaway role--did most of her scenes end up on the cutting room floor?). Deserves credit for a fairly original death involving a blood transfusion, but the payoff is muted--something of a metaphor for the film as a whole.47/100",Ma
60,m-47826,The movie that killed Octavia Spencer's fleeting success.,3,15 November 2021,"I never found her to be an extremely talented actress. She made me laugh in some of her comedies roles, on TV mostly. But that's about it. Her character in Ma was kind of similar to hers from Ugly Betty. And that's probably why the movie kept me. She's good in those creepy/stalkerish women parts, adding humor and the right amount of tragedy to it. But the script is very predictable and you guess her character's motive, too early on the movie. The part where she gets her revenge, is clearly the best. After a slow and underwhelming build up. The rest of the cast, is your run of the mill clichés, borrowed from movies like Carrie, a Nightmare on Elm Street, and other 80s slashers. The storyline is built around that concept, and can be seen as an homage to it even. Only it never exceeds the expectations you have of it. Decent but forgettable, regardless of the way it is trying to be thought provoking. The movie is shallow and unsubstantial. Which seems to be Blumhouse productions biggest issue...",Ma
61,arungeorge13,"Octavia Spencer is solid, but the film's too predictable! [+42%]",4,16 June 2020,"Barring a wicked performance from Octavia Spencer, there's not a lot going in Ma's favour to recommend it. The film is a slow-burn revenge thriller with shades of slasher-horror. Spencer gives it her all, but the rest of the cast (including the likes of Juliette Lewis, Diana Silvers, and Luke Evans) do not have compelling arcs beyond their one-notedness. It gets a little nasty towards the final act, though there's nothing gorehounds would turn their face away from. The screenplay is quite basic, with questionable logic, and filled with scenes that fail to add up to something greater than what you already know by seeing the trailer. If you've got 100 minutes to kill, then consider this a throwaway watch.",Ma

I tell you people around me screamed out, everyone squirmed and Octavia Spencer mastered menacing.This a was a great movie, within the psycho-horror genre this delivers, not like Get Out, but certainly very convincingly.I loved it",Ma

66,saptesh786,Ma is interested in parties !,2,22 October 2019,Good story plot but not developed well that makes movie downing its importance. Even end is not justified. Leading actresses looks over smart intentionally actual they are not. Thus way movie seems dumb. Main character of Ma is well played by Octavia Spencer. Others are not mentionable so badly acting. Actresses are horrible. Overall not recommended by me. You will find waste of time. So avoid. Two star is sufficient one for Octavia and one for story plot.,Ma
67,MadamWarden,MEDIOCRE MA,4,25 April 2020,"Some of the worst acting and I have seen in a long time, coupled with a really weak script and ridiculous plot make this a really mediocre movie.I guess one shouldn't really expect much from a teen ""horror""movie...",Ma
68,aciessi,Fun,6,2 June 2019,"Ma is a throwback to campy 1980's horror. Filled with teens, alcohol and bad decisions. But this time the killer is played by Octavia Spencer, who was wronged a teenager when the parents of the kids we see here played an awful joke on her. It's as simple as that. As most slasher movies historically operate, this is a revenge fantasy. Spencer is creepy and convincing as Ma. It's a fun horror movie to watch in a theater. Turn your brain off and enjoy.",Ma
69,rockman182,Ma (2019),7,2 June 2019,"Don't make her drink alone! This looked like another version of Greta (which I highly enjoyed) where a very talented actress takes on the role of a psycho stalker. Tate Taylor had previously worked with Octavia Spencer on The Help and she jumped at the opportunity to go outside the box and play a role so left field for her. Ma could certainly have been written better and had potential but its anchored by a really good Octavia Spencer performance. You'll just be scratching your head at the stupidity in the film.The film is about a group of teens who are looking to drink and hang out with each other. They one day come across a lady, dubbed ""Ma"" who buys them alcohol and allows them to hang out in her basement to do whatever they want. Things seem perfect in the beginning but soon the group realize that there is something way off for Ma and she becomes obsessed with them and they want to find out the secrets that she is hiding. Diana Silvers, Luke Evans, and Juliette Lewis also star.Spencer is fantastic in this and seems so comfortable in this unique role for her. She's the life that keeps the party moving. Teenagers are dumb but the decision making on their end is questionable. The main problem with the film is the fact that it becomes super easy to predict what is going to happen. It's an interesting idea because I do love psychological thrillers but its not all that it could have been.The theater I went to had a really good time with it though.Its an entertaining watch I'd say and its brainless fun, which ultimately is what it should be. I'm sure its very aware of how campy and cheesy it gets and it takes advantage of that. I liked seeing Octavia Spencer try something different and also like the look of Diana Silvers (especially after seeing her in Booksmart). Its just a little bizarre that the basement of a middle aged woman could become the drinking spot for all the cool kids. Like is that really how bad this town is?6.5/10",Ma
70,RforFilm,"Had Ma embraced it's dark comic potential more, i might have liked it more",5,4 June 2019,"I think I was as young as five when I was told about ""Stranger Danger"". My parents would always talk about how it was important not to approach strangers. To be fair, there is a lot that kids don't know about and even when they become teenagers, their bound to let their own naivety get in the way of not knowing better, especially when meeting other people. While I only went to high school when MySpace was still a thing, I can't imagine the pressure today's kids face when dealing with meeting online people on their social media channels.In fact, I think there's a point where I hope parents do pay attention to who their children are communicating with of Facebook or Instagram. I understand that they want their children to feel independent, but I'd say its something else when random people are thrown into the mix. Today's movie has to deal with a group of kids that stupidly bring a stranger adult into their world, but their parents only realize that she's dangerous until it's too late. It's a style of horror that can scare people in different ways and I like that. So let's see what's going on in Ma.Teenager Maggie Thompson (played by Dianna Silvers) had just moved with her mother back to Ohio where they hope for a better life. Her mother, Erica (played by Juliette Lewis) had grown up her and thus, has a lot of ex high school friends who all have children of their own. When Maggie goes to school, she meets another girl Haley, and is introduced to Chaz, Darrell, and Chaz, where they all decide to get some alchohol and have some fun. They all take turns standing outside, trying to get an adult to by booze. When Maggie tries by chance with a veterinary assistant
Sue Ann (played by Octavia Spencer), she agrees and the seeds are planted.Sue Ann starts to follow the kids on social media to learn about them. After the kids are caught , Sue assures them that if they want to drink in a safe place, their free to use her basement as a party zone. At first, the kids think nothing of it and host a couple of parties. But as Maggie notices her jewelry missing and her constant messages from Sue Ann, or as she call herself ""Ma"", she becomes weary of going back. It becomes clear that Ma has a lot of demons and may have her own agenda.I can say there is something of an appeal to Ma. Is it an entertaining movie? It can be. Is it a good story? I wouldn't go that far. It's the kind of thriller that you have more fun with then questioning it. I did thanks to it's two leads Octavia Spencer and Diana Silvers. Octavia Spencer uses this chance to play against her type and proves she can be quite intimidating. Diana has the right look of pretty and ordinary. I think it had to do with her eyes and eyebrows witch didn't feel fake.So what about their stories? This is where the script was having trouble. The logic applied relies either on teenagers making stupid decisions or Octavia Spencer's character offbeat writing. I know teenagers that party would love to have a place where their parents wouldn't know where they were, but I still feel like there'd be more hesitation to suddenly go drink with this woman just because her place is available. With social media and constant worries of missing people, you'd think these kids would know better.Let's get back to Octavia Spencer. A lot like Annie Wilkes from Misery, the movie tries to give this character a lot of backstory to explain her connection to these kids and their parents. Without giving it away, it does become revenge-like. I can see what they were trying to do, but even with what happened to her when she was younger, I still didn't feel like I got to know her enough to sympathize with her. I think this movie needed to be funnier in order forgive the underwritten aspect. I did laugh a couple of times and the movie clearly knows how darkly humorous the scenario is. It just needed to embrace that side more.I'll give this five teenage vans out of ten. It's not without enjoyment and may even provide as a cautionary tale for teenagers, their use of social media, and stranger danger. This is something that needed more of an identity. I think it's audience will still have fun regardless. If this is your cup of tea, then by all means take a visit to Ma.",Ma

As ever, she's not what she seems and so on.Firstly, there's some very good acting from Octavia Spencer in the lead, Juliette Lewis co starring, and the youngsters are good. The dialogue is fine too.The problem is that what's the story about or heading to? Is it really a botched MeToo revenge fantasy? Seems like it to me, and it just doesn't add up to me. It's too difficult to find any empathy no matter what they tried for anyone in this film, and it all just feels botched no matter how much they slapped on.The storylines are not intriguing and it's boring, and some of the 'twists' don't add much or anything at all. It's all just a shambles.It's not a long movie, but there have been far better in the recent spate of alternative suspense horror films (like Get Out).

74,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Girl revenge against high school crush/meanie boy who made a fool of her.,5,25 August 2019,"I didn't have great expectations for this film because usually when you have a cast of older teenager or early 20s in a movie, the story will usually try to sell movie tickets by showing teen boobs. That's not what I like in horror movies.But this one has Octavia Spencer and I have to admit I am a fan of hers. I think she is super adorable. So I gave this film a try. It's not terrible, but it is pretty mediocre. I think this screenplay was really beneath her acting caliber.This revenge story centers around the character Sue Ann and how she was bullied by eh, an evil meanie boy she had a crush on as a young girl in high school and her revenge 30 years later on those who did her wrong by going after their children. There really isn't a deep drama between Sue Ann and Bill. Bill knew Sue Ann had a crush on him and he took advantage of her by making a fool out of her. That's the drama, nothing much more than that. The ending is lame and so was the whole story.Had the movie had less dialog with the stupid teens and made the story between Sue Ann and Bill richer, and more complex, more tension, it could have been a better movie. I would have liked Sue Ann to have been a more complex and more sophisticated manipulator.

The most stupid part in the movie is when Ma make a dog blood transfusion with the guy in the bed and literally 2 seconds after, kill him. Why make the blood transfusion if you gonna kill him after?!! This could have been a much better story. I was disappointed by it because, throughout the movie, it felt like everything could've been prevented or stopped. I understand most movies like this do ignore all common sense and logic though.

79,SoumikBanerjee25,Missed opportunity!,4,25 August 2020,"""Ma"" is a Horror-Thriller that fails to stand out on either of the aforementioned genre niches! An Incoherent screenplay with absurd character choices makes its case even weaker!
What started on a promising note, quickly fallen off from its peak of expectency! Keeping in mind that it belongs to Blumhouse Productions; which I am a huge fan of, that fact alone baffles me a lot!
By the midway of second act, it becomes predictable and loses its touch of suspense and thrill! A disjointed writing, coupled with messy screenplay takes a huge hit when it comes to plotline cohesiveness. Preposterous decisions taken by ensembled characters make me question about the authenticity on the writing front. As it seems the script was in very much need of further rectification.Octavia Spencer is great, and perhaps the saving soul. A versatile graph in her performance that keeps you engaged for the entire runtime. Other roles being played by mostly young actors; who had done okay jobs. Some veterans were also present such as Luke Evans, Alisson Janney but unfortunately they being heavily underutilized.On the technicalities, it is pretty decent. Cinematography looked fine with nothing out of the blue. Sound score had a montage of vintage music that I personally enjoyed.
It surely helped in some particular situations where a creepy vibe is required.In short, I had some respectable expectations from it. Sadly it just didn't stand out to me. A half baked thriller that could have been so much better only if they treated some circumstances accordingly.",Ma

It also annoyed me how they'd say nobody go to her house and how's she's crazy then a day later they'd all be there having a party.

Different, weird, cringe-worthy in parts ... is that a good enough start? ""Ma"" is one of those films that tries really hard to avoid the pitfalls of being formulaic and cookie cutter but in the process of doing so, it falls well short of being anything remarkable.Our story starts when Erica Thompson (Juliette Lewis) and her teenage daughter, Maggie (Diana Silvers), move to the town that Erica grew up in. It isn't long before Maggie makes some friends from school and after being coaxed into trying to score some booze for a party, she is helped out by a veterinary nurse on her way home from work named Sue Ann (Octavia Spencer). Thinking that Sue Ann is beyond cool, they nickname her ""Ma"". But it isn't long before the waters begin to sour, old secrets are uncovered and lives are at risk. There is much more boiling under the surface than Maggie and her friends realize. And they are right there, in her house and in her clutches.Okay, so I went into this one thinking it was going to be pretty good because I think Octavia Spencer is a very good actress. And even though she really puts her all into the role, this was not a good match for her. Instead of her character giving me moments of uneasiness and discomfort, it was the entire movie that did that. It just didn't really gel or become coherent. The whole angle with Ma's daughter I never understood and still don't among other things. The whole film felt disjointed and off-kilter, not just Ma. The whole movie did. And the ending was just .... weird.I don't recommend this one. The potential was there, but the overall delivery was a major disappointment. This is a pass.

I expected out of this world acting from her though (maybe something I haven't seen before), but maybe I'm just expecting her to be perfect, because she definitely did a great job. I just thought since it's named Ma that it was centered around the main character because it was something extraordinary, but her character's story does have pretty good depth.Not a bad rental, but I'm a little glad I didn't drop $15-$20 to buy it, in all honesty.

The plot could have made for a decent film, but the acting just kills it.

96,Mike_Devine,Not the high point of Spencer's career,4,2 July 2020,"2019 was unquestionably a big year for the horror genre, and the Octavia Spencer-starring 'Ma' is perhaps one of the more overlooked films of the year. The low-budget teen frightfest has its moments, but it's pretty predictable and generic, nevermind gruesome.The best part about 'Ma' is far and away Spencer, as the Academy Award-winning actress brings every aspect of Sue Ann to life in a way that few others could. The evolution of the folksy ""cool mom"" to nightmarish psychopath is fun to watch, sure. But the rest of the cast is subpar, most notably the no-name young actors who don't do anything except get on your nerves. And then there are scenes that are just completely pointless, being included merely for shock value.It's hard to point to any redeemable qualities for 'Ma,' so it's better to just acknowledge that it's a lower-tier thriller. Don't worry, Octavia - we won't hold it against you.",Ma
97,SnobReviews,"""Ma"" is flawed but entertaining.",6,21 August 2019,"""Ma"" is surprisingly enerving in multiple ways; it'll make your blood boil over but it will also make you wish it offered more.In this psychological thriller, a lonely woman invites underage teenagers to party in her basement, but sinister plans lie ahead.While Octavia Spencer delivers yet another solid performance, ""Ma"" can't help but be flawed by psychologic horror clichés. A film with this much talent in front and behind the camera should be offering something different rather than a film we've seen before. Spencer along with somewhat newcomer Diana Silvers (see ""Booksmart"") really keep this film a float and interesting. Even though I felt as though I had seen this film before, I was still entertained and anxiously awaited the final act.",Ma
98,fluffchop,Well I watched it all,3,24 October 2021,It's not something you want to turn off as you are always waiting for there to be a point to it. It just sort of meanders along with some flashbacks here and there. Ma is a relatable character and you can see how this unusual movie makes sense. I didn't think much of any of the teenagers except for McKaley Miller who is stunning. She could go a long way as an actress. Looking up her work shows her as a TV actress. That should change but probably never will. She has star quality amongst the cast of dreadful teens.,Ma
99,akshatmahajan,Enjoyed it,7,27 June 2021,"Ma is a type of movie which you can relate and can enjoy. The concept of Ma is not so different, a maladjusted adult tries to live her unfulfilled teenage dreams. After seeing what she does, you may think, ""what if this happens with you in real life?"".Movie was creepy, just like it's supposed to be. Octavia Spencer as the lead actress played her role perfectly. There's mystery and spookyness in her character which you can feel while watching her.Some people complained that the movie exaggerated many things but I didn't have any problem with it. Being a horror movie, why not exaggerate a few things and have some fun with it?Overall, it is a movie which you can watch and enjoy. Do give it a try and avoid negative reviews because the negativity is mainly due to realism which I think this type of movie didn't need.",Ma
100,baunacholi-86159,"No, Ma",4,9 February 2021,I really wanted to like it. But it's just another teenage party stupid decisions lead to bad consequences flick. The only saving grace is Mrs. O.

starring:Octavia Spencer,Luke Evans,Diana Silvers,Juliette Levers,Mckaley Miller,Corey Fogelmanis,Gianni Paolo,Dante Brown,Tanyell Wavers,Missi Pyle and Alisson janey etcoverall rating 78/100Ma was everything a good thriller should be intense,disturbing and creepy, and with an excellent lead as well this film has a lot
going for it lets talk about why this is.the first big positive for me would be the films tense atmosphere and tone. The film did a brilliant job at keeping you at the edge of your seat not just with the soundtrack but also with the lack of sound . This really made a lot more of the scenes more impactful and unexpected something which a lot of horror and thriller films are doing recently which i love. I also loved the gore within the film. I am a big fan of over the top violence and gore within films. But the gore in this film really added to the impact of the terrifying scenes in the final act involving Mas breakdown and was done excellently. And not so over the top that it became laughable but just enough to leave you grabbing for a cushion.Next the film had very impactful jump scares.This was not constant jump scares like a horror movie but jump scares that caught you off guard which is what i loved about Ma it was so unique and you never knew what was going to happen so when the film did make you jump it really made an impact on the whole film and its horror influences.Next the film had very informative subject matter. The whole message of young kids easily being manipulated by adults unfortunately is a big issue in todays society. And i think this film informed the audience watching to be more careful around people you dont know which i think is a positive theme to express through the negative side of child grooming and manipulation.However the film did hold a lot of over reliance on generic stereotypes for teenagers. I Just think the film focused to much on teens being rebellious and drinking and smoking underage. I think this causes a slight negative stigma surrounding the youth which only represents a small portion of them but this film normalised teens doing these types of things.Next the film was actually pretty funny in places. There was a lot of awkward situations within many of the parties that despite being stereotypical was still funny. Just awkward situations like the toilets being used for sexual activities and everyone needing to get inside i just find awkward situations like that very humourous. Also Ma when she was not being a psychopath was actually fairly funny the way she was trying to socialise with the kids via dancing and shots was entertaining as she did not fit in with everyone.However the pacing was fairly slow during places within the film. I Just wish that that could of kept the same fast paced edge of the seat entertainment throughout the whole film and not just the second half of the film. This is not a negative just a constructive criticism, however if it was like the final act throughout the whole film then there would not of been as much character development so its just something that would of made it an incredible film not a very good one.Next i really liked the relatable themes and messages during the film. The main message that i liked that was explored well was the anxiety of starting a new school. Dianna Silver who by the way did a good acting job within the film really expressed a lot of relatability with her character Maggie as she was trying everything to fit in and make friends. Which i think every person does at the beginning high school i think they did this in a refreshing way and made Maggies character very likeable.There is just two more little nitpicks that i would like to add. I wish they had a bit more narrative character development between Maggie and her friendship group. They could of added a lot more depth to the characters but most of the friendship group were just generic, they did start to add more of a character arc between Maggie and Andy ( Corey Fogelmanis) which i liked but this also made the other members of the friendship group feel less important. And also i felt like the film could of had the potential to be even more scary. The final act was fantastic and admittedly terrifying, however i feel like with a slightly bigger budget the film could of been consistently scary throughout the film as a whole.However ending on my main massive positive and that would Be octavia spencers performance and Mas character arc and development. Octavia Spencer was absolutely fantastic in this film and this really adds to her versatility to her brilliant acting ability. She made the character of Ma terrifying to witness due to how mentally unstable she was and Octavias performance added to the creepiness of her character, whether it was her facial expressions or unpredictability you never knew what she was going to do. Next i loved her character arc the use of flashbacks and the amount of detail they went into in explaining Sue annes past and reasoning for her actions really made you understand what her character is going through it obviously does not justify her actions but you felt her pain and emotional rage and reuniting with her school bullies so Octavia spencer is worthy of many oscars and awards.Overall Ma is a brilliantly creepy and entertaining thriller that had the potential to be better but still manages to do a good job with the small budget it had.",Ma
104,gustheaffen,Wasn't horrible but had some nonsensical behavior,6,3 March 2020,What luck to run into some kids that just happen to belong to your high school tormentors which I guess brings back all the pain and angst. This started out interesting and kind of quickly devolved into a revenge movie at the end and frankly the revenge was a bit harsh and gross and in regards to the kids misplaced. But it was different enough to be entertaining compared to most horror movies these days.,Ma
105,movieman6-413-929510,Ma responds in a narrow way to current events.,6,3 June 2019,"Ma is a new thriller directed by Tate Taylor, the director of The Help and The Girl on the Train.Maggie (Diana Silvers) has just moved to a small town in Ohio. To impress her new friends, she asks an adult woman named Sue Ann (Octavia Spencer) if she wants to buy alcoholic beverages for her. Maggie and her friends are too young to be able to buy alcohol legally.
Surprisingly, Sue wants to do this best for Maggie and her friends and, strangely enough, even suggests that they can party with her in the basement. If they follow her rules and call her ""Ma"", they may come to her cellar to party more often.
Ma her basement quickly becomes a popular party location for the youth, but Maggie learns that Ma is hiding a dark secret from her and the rest of the teenagers. So she actually has more evil intentions for Maggie and the others.With this film they respond well to how loneliness, bullying and underage drinking can lead to great dangers. The film also plays in current affairs where older people are more often lonely and younger teenagers start alcoholic drinks too early.
It is a pity that the film script of the film was written less realistically. Indeed, there are plenty of moments in the film where, if they were to think or act in a realistic, smart way, the teenagers could be relieved of Ma's dark actions. As a viewer, it is better not to think too much about all situations that occur in the film. For the script writer, this is also his first film script, for which he has written more scripts for various comedy series.Despite the fact that the film has a less detailed script, Octavia Spencer manages to put down its role well. She also knows how to portray her character in various ways. In this way she comes across one scene as a lonely lady, while in the next she comes across as an eerie woman again. That way she knows how to carry the film well. Regarding the casting, they cast a good cast on Maggie and her mother, who is played in the film by Juliette Lewis, because they look realistic as mother and daughter by appearance. The further cast that the other teenagers play is also not particularly unusual due to the lesser script. Some play more stereotypes that are more common in teenage films.",Ma

109,darkreignn,Very entertaining from beginning to end,7,18 February 2020,"I originally wrote this review back in May of 2019. I was scrolling through my account, and noticed that IMDb has deleted the review from their site. This is the second time IMDb has done something like to me, and I am thoroughly offended and hurt by their constant attempts to censor me. In this case, I am doubly offended, because my review was approved and allowed to remain on their site for months before inexplicably being deleted, without forewarning or explicit reasoning. I realize this is their site, and they can decide what content to allow, or not allow, but I would at least like a reason for why a previously approved review has been deleted months later. Anyway, here is my original review for ""Ma:""Maybe I have a soft spot for movies about high school students (redacted for brevity so imdb can publish my review after literally weeks of my resubmissions being declined repeatedly), but I can honestly say I enjoyed the *expletive* out of this movie.""Ma"" was straight up fun from beginning to end; I can honestly say that I wasn't bored once throughout the entire runtime of this film, and that's probably the highest praise a movie can get. ""Ma,"" starring Octavia Spencer and directed by Tate Taylor, is more a psychological thriller than a horror film, but whatever it is, it's 100% entertainment.Listen, I'm not going to waste time delving into the story of ""Ma."" You already know that the script rivals films like ""The Godfather"" and ""Forrest Gump."" Okay sure, I'm being mildly sarcastic, but in all honestly, even though you may have heard opinions to the contrary, the script isn't all that bad. Yes, sometimes the characters are kind of stupid, and by kind of, I mean very. For example, even though our main characters, as sexy and nubile as ever, realize that Ma is a complete weirdo and a potentially dangerous person, they never stop going over her house even when recognizing that they should not go back to her house. Here is basically how conversations go in this movie: ""Listen, I know we've had a lot of fun at Ma's house but she's getting stalker-ish! She's spying on us and calling us and texting us non-stop, she comes to see us at school and yells at us, she's flirting with us, we just can't go back, she's dangerous!"" I know, but she got Fireball! ""*expletive* Fireball?! We're going to Ma's tonight, let's get drunk!""See what I mean? The characters don't act like the most intelligent high school kids out there, but I'll be *expletive* if I didn't have such a fantastic time watching this movie that the questionable parts of the script didn't even bother me. I was consistently engrossed by what was happening on screen. With the lack of any sort of fluff or downtime, ""Ma"" moves at a quick pace, never leaving you enough time to be bored or tired of what's happening. And best of all, it's just downright entertaining. It has enough twists and surprises to keep you looking forward to what's going to happen next, and enough disturbing horror violence to make you wince. ""Ma"" isn't a perfect movie by any means, and it's by not the best movie I've seen this year, but it's definitely one of the most entertaining ones.7/10",Ma
110,Aly200,An interesting take on the stalker subgenre,7,20 September 2019,"After the disappointing adaptation of ""The Girl on the Train"", Tate Taylor delivers a much more solid original story. While not the most original movie in the ""stalker film"" genre, but it has a few tricks to differentiate itself from some of the others that preceded it. I shall try to keep spoilers mild as the trailers hint more of them.The film follows new girl, Maggie, as she and her mother move to California after her parents' divorce. She and her new friends soon befriend a veterinary technician, Sue Ann, who eventually becomes obsessed with the kids. Obviously the film takes a dark turn midway through and you can kind of guess where the clichés pop up.While Diana Silvers delivers a spunky and rebellious teenager in Maggie who strays from the generic dumb teen final girl (though there is no actual final girl here), the movie's obvious standout is Octavia Spencer as Sue Ann/Ma. Initially starting out as caring, sweet and snarky towards the teens we quickly see at her job that there is something off about Sue Ann. Her obsessive behavior towards the kids is decently paced, but was given away in the trailers so we aren't too shocked when the teens get freaked out. However her tragic past is actually a humane touch to her unstable nature even if some might call it cliché. I won't elaborate as it gives away key moments to the film, but I will say that it touches on one of the most problematic issues among youths in our culture now.The tonal shifts are off-putting at times as we go from fun and rambunctious to creepy and unsettling in extreme sequences. One standout is when Sue Ann goes after one of her victims with a dark comedic touch, but it's supposed to be shocking except we see it coming. One of the darker moments before the finale between another victim and Ma is uncomfortable to watch and then gets gruesome without heading into ""Sweeney Todd"" territory.While not a totally original and terrific film, give ""Ma"" a chance and enjoy the ride. There is hint of magic that isn't quite fully realized yet is worth watching Octavia Spencer bring her usual A-game.",Ma
111,CriticsVoiceVideo,Watch for Octavia.,4,23 March 2021,"This could have been really good, especially with Octavia Spencer turning in a perfect hilarious performance. But it's executed so poorly and so lightweight and the ending is completely asinine and laughable. They didn't even try to give it a proper ending. The rest of the cast is completely forgettable but the boy did have a cute butt. Overall, a big disappointment.",Ma
112,rlaine,Good and quite well balanced creeper,8,19 January 2021,"I really enjoyed this one, very well put together in most if not all areas. It's not all horror and actually the horror part is quite mild, but there is layered drama too and you actually feel the characters. This was a surprisingly well balanced combo of entertainment, drama and thriller/horror.Acted very well, especially Octavia Spencer puts together a great character. So many layers to her. Really liked Juliette Lewis too.This is a story of bullies and how they can destroy a person. Part revenge story, love story, going nuts story.. Spencers character is very multi-dimensional. She runs into a situation where she suddenly has a chance to be seen as cool, things add up, situation leads to another, a revenge seems possible.I liked the fact that not all of the backstory was left for an ultimate twist in the end, but rather serve them here and there to build up Ma's story. I did initially feel a bit let down how early they started revealing Ma's past, which did take a bit of the mystery and overall creepiness, but it played out well, there are still twists along the way.Would've liked to know a bit more of Ma's daughter and their relationship, she clearly sheltered her, but what happened to her father or who he was would've been a nice add to the story.The direction is pretty stylish as well as the cinematography. Thumbs up!",Ma
113,danybur,A current witch,5,12 October 2021,"SummaryA thriller that turns to terror, with a predictable general structure, although with a not so linear development and that is damaged by an Octavia Spencer who plays a villain with opaque realism that never stops disturbing.ReviewThe teenage Maggie (Diana Silvers) and her mother Erica (the reappeared Juliette Lewis) move from San Diego to the youth town of the second. The girl becomes a group of friends at school and they establish a relationship with Sue Ann (Octavia Spencer), a middle-aged woman, who agrees to buy alcohol for them in order to gain her trust.Tate Taylor's film is a thriller that ends up turning to horror. The subgenre of ""back to the hometown"" is displaced from Erica to her daughter. While Sue Ann's motivations become clear sooner rather than later (reinforced by fairly obvious flash backs) and the general structure of the story is predictable, it must be recognized that its development is less linear than expected, at least in its first half. What Sue Ann, a kind of modern witch, does, refers to other horror films that should not be revealed and she and the film flirt with some behaviors whose target is the young men with whom she deals.Added to the lack of originality of the film is the poor performance of Octavia Spencer. Perhaps attached to a realistic register that borders on reluctance, her interpretation detracts from a villain who never worries.",Ma

Despite this, it still wasn't a good movie and nothing really made any sense. However, I kind of had a good time with it due to how over the top Octavia Spencer was in this. She elevated it significantly and overshadowed pretty much everyone else here. Any time she was on screen I was engaged into it. Everybody else pretty much sucks though, so any time she isn't in the spotlight the movie becomes generic and cliched. Characters make dumb decisions and stuff so that the plot can keep going and more issues arise, so that's pretty typical. There's alot of issues with the dialogue and writing, and how the story is structured too.As for the other actors, they range from bad to functional at best and most of them are Teen stereotypes or one dimensional. There's a few forced Jumpscares in there just because the movie has to have Jumpscares I guess? Nothing too special about the music and surprisingly not much violence at all. To sum this movie up best, it's basically a sub-standard Horror movie that's elevated by one really good performance, and everyone else is lurking in the shadows. I did get a few laughs out of it though, both intentionally and unintentionally, so it's not the worst thing you could watch. However, if I tried to be objective about it rather than seeing it as a Guilty Pleasure, Ma would probably be somewhere around a 3 or 4/10 rating.",Ma

These kind of films usually use a young antagonist for the part, just this one went a different way and used a grown adult. The violence towards the end was pretty disturbing. Some of the deaths are towards the last half of the film. I was just expecting a larger and more intense showdown at the end, but it was pretty brief.",Ma

128,KoolCatReviews,A good lead antagonist but a strange plot,4,17 April 2020,"The plot was strange and quite non-sense at times. One or two ideas presented were good but alittle of the horror seemed manufactured with a few cheap jump scares. There is no real tension created here unfortunately. Towards the end of the movie it trys to step it up a notch but, to much disappointment, falls flat. Our main antogonist performance is good but I can't help thinking on or two changes to the script really could of helped this film out. The teenagers act pretty stupidly through out the movie and this makes the whole premise seems silly at times. A few times classic tunes are used which can be quite enjoyable. Could have be much improved upon but least we have a good performance from our female antogonist.",Ma
129,MinistryofDoom,Octavia Spencer is Fantastic in this Disturbing Thriller,6,25 August 2019,"Not a bad thriller but it took a little long to get to where it needed to go. The main takeaway here is that Mental Health is a serious issue and needs to be discussed more often. Octavia Spencer's ""Ma"" is a thoroughly disturbed individual who has been holding a grudge against some childhood bullies for many years. That grudge has manifested in some strange behaviors that are not fully explained in the film but then again, sometimes disturbed individuals do disturbed things that cannot be explained.The story mainly revolves around a young girl named Maggie and her mother (Juliette Lewis) who move back to the mother's hometown where they set up in a quiet neighborhood. Maggie soon falls in with a group of kids who like to get drive out to the edge of town to drink alcohol. They are introduced to Octavia Spencer's Ma outside of a liquor store where they successfully convince her to buy alcohol for them. Slowly Ma and the group of kids become increasingly close. She buys them alcohol and they hang out with her until it takes a very deadly turn when Ma discovers a connection that these kids have with an event that affected her when she was their age. That's when the past catches up to the present in a deadly and disturbingly violent string of events that will have you cringing at times. Overall very good film.",Ma

143,theredsky,Ma Review,3,9 June 2019,"This is another mixed bag for me. There a lot of problems with this film. Here are the negatives. The teenage actors did not do a good job. All 5 of them had no emotion in their performances and delivered their lines as boring as possible and their characters are uninteresting. Although the concept for the film is good, the film has a problem like Brightburn. The story feels very basic and the film doesn't do anything interesting with its concept. Some aspects of the story can feel dumb at times and the first 15 minutes are boring. The film does have a pacing issue also. Sometimes the film is slow while other times, it moves quickly. Here are the positives. The adult actors do a decent job. Luke Evans does a great job and Octavia Spencer steals the spotlight in every scene she is in. Her performance is by far the best thing about this movie. Her performance is worth seeing the movie. This film along with Brightburn knows how to build tension very well. You always feel this overwhelming sense of dread until the film comes to a head at the climax. There isn't a lot of gore in this film but when it is used, it is used effectively and makes you feel uncomfortable which is what the film is going for. There are some genuinely funny moments in this film even if that wasn't what the scene was going for. The cinematography is good in some areas and the tone does remain consistent throughout the film. The film also has a nice anti bullying message that is very evident by the end of the film. Overall, Ma provides some good acting from the adults and a nice message but fails to provide something more than its concept. I give Ma a 3/10.",Ma

Plus it has Diana Silvers who I reckon is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood at the moment.The plot is rather basic and has been done many many times before. Woman who was traumatized in school sets about to take revenge on the people who inflicted the pain on her. Only this time she goes after the children of the people involved.The revenge story is rather tepid for the most part but gets really dark & gruesome towards the end.

I dont hold anything against Octavia Spencer but I disagree with people saying she elevates or carries the film. An hour in before I gave up on this her character still lacked any depth. I however dont think its the actresses fault. She just doesn't have meaty lines. Its so frickin dull.

150,cappiethadog,I don't appreciate my ma enough,5,22 October 2019,"Holly Hunter, as the cool mom, in Christine Hardwicke's ""Thirteen""(2003), only wanted to hang out with her daughter(played by Evan Rachel Wood) and daughter's friends, not kill her, slowly, ""Flowers in the Attic""-style, like Sue Ann Ellington(Octavia Spencer) in Tate Taylor's ""Ma"", and replace her, hoping nobody will notice that she's forty-seven, and not eighteen. Genie(Tanyell Waivers), Sue Ann's girl, is wheelchair-bound, and Maggie Thompson(Diana Silvers), a San Diego transplant, helps the disabled girl up a ramp. But that interaction is something of a red herring. Genie vanishes before these two young women get the chance to become friends. Unbeknownst to both teenagers; one black, one white, their mothers knew each other. Maggie and Genie are second-generation rural Ohioan high school students. Back in the day, Erica(Juliette Lewis) was part of the in-crowd, but she didn't possess a mean streak like ""it"" couple Ben Hawkins(Luke Evans) and Mercedes(Missi Pyle), who looked down on Sue Ann(Kyanna Simone Simone), a shy nerd, and worse, was made the target of practical jokes, probably, for being a shy ""black"" nerd. Since Maggie, being the new girl, ran into Genie the next day at lunch, or at the library, it's hard to imagine them not forming, at the very least. a temporary friendship. But could that fragile bond withstand the arrival of competition, when Haley(McKayley Miller), a queen bee contender, asks Molly to join their tribe? Would Maggie repeat the sins of her mother? Erica forgets, but she probably abandoned Sue Ann to a certain extent. She probably forgot the veterinarian tech, altogether. But her younger self(Teagan Edsell) looks pained, knowing what shenanigans was in store for the only black girl in small town Ohio. Erica let it happen, though. She chose to be popular. Sue Ann was in love with Ben(Andrew Matthew Welch) at 17. He wrote a love letter, inviting her to meet him in an empty classroom with the lights out. But Mercedes(Nicole Carpenter), Ben's main squeeze, was a different animal from Sue Snell(Amy Irving). Erica was, in essence, a nice girl, but Tommy's girlfriend proved it every day leading up to senior prom. She made the ultimate sacrifice, letting her boyfriend take Carrie White. That was yesterday, though, a long, long time ago, not the recent past. Mercedes didn't sacrifice anything. Sue Ann Ellington ""is"" the sacrifice; an offering to the gods and goddesses of perpetual teenage cruelty, a sacred tradition since the archetypal quarterback pantsed the original nerd.""They're going to laugh at you,"" mama warns Carrie(Sissy Spacek) when she learns that her maladjusted daughter is going to the prom. Margaret White(Piper Laurie), a real piece of work, proved to be right, when the degraded prom queen returns home from a deadly telekinesis exhibition, drenched in pig blood. ""Carrie""(1976), directed by Brian DePalma, adapted from the Stephen King epistolary novel, uncannily predicted the sad phenomena of school massacres. Carrie's mind is deadlier than a gun. In retrospect, Carrie White was cut in the mode of Jean Grey(Famke Janssen) a.k.a. Marvel Girl, in Bryan Singer's ""X-Men""(2000), but unfortunately for the untapped superheroine, her powers existed in a filmic world similar to the corporeal one, like ours. There is no Xavier Institute for Higher Learning for a teenage weirdo like Carrie. She and Rogue(Anna Paquin) would have hit it off. A mentor, such as Professor Xavier(Patrick Stewart) could have changed the gifted young girl's life. But alas, ""Scary Carrie"" is more like Dark Phoenix. She goes home, undresses and turns the bathtub water red. The defeated girl returns to the ecclesiastical ratiocination prison of her mother's poisoned mind, even though she wasn't washing off her own sin, but Chris Hargensen's sin; she(Nancy Allen) had convinced Billy Nolan(John Travolta), her abusive beau, to butcher that factory farm pig, whose blood filled the silver bucket poised over Carrie and her date Tommy Ross(William Katt), the newly-elected prom queen and king, on that makeshift stage in the school gymnasium. Margaret's mad recurring naivety towards secular life, once again, harms her only child, who only wants to be comforted. In all likelihood, Ms. White misinterprets the blood as emblematizing her daughter's incipient womanhood. After all, Margaret White, a hypocrite as it pertains to sex, told Carrie after her first experience with menstruation in the girls' shower room: ""After the blood comes the boys. Like sniffing dogs...trying to find out what that smell is..."" Just bat***t cray-cray ramblings, legitimized by an idiosyncratic interpretation of the ""good book"". Margaret punishes Carrie; her bleeding, a reminder that the young woman is not a immaculate conception, but the end-result of pro-creation with a man that shattered Margaret White's mind by leaving. Margaret stabs her, then follows-up this first attempt at murder, in which she pursues Carrie with a waved knife, pantomiming the sign of the cross, leaving Carrie no choice, but to stave off the finishing touch of her own murder by sending sharp object into the familial attacker's body.""Everyone can see your dirty pillows."" That's what Margaret told her daughter before she left the house for ""Prom Now: The Apocalypse"".Andy Hawkins(Corey Fogelmanis) is Ben's son. To make him love her, Sue Ann, more than twice his age, buys hard liquor for the boy and his underage friends. But Andy, he only has eyes for Maggie. It's a bizarre love triangle, made even more bizarre, when you realize that ""Ma"" slowly kills her daughter in order to get a second chance at Ben Hawkins, in the form of his son. Sue Ann lets the kids use her basement as their hangout to booze it up, vicariously reliving her high school years, a case of false nostalgia. Genie, similar to Carrie, is an outcast, by means of a severely damaged woman's religious extremism. In ""Ma"", Sue Ann's warped view of God is only hinted at. She has only one house rule; she doesn't want any of her guests to take the lord's name in vain.Genie doesn't have the power of telekinesis. She hits Sue Ann with a frying pan of her own volition, sending ma down a flight of stairs. Genie can walk. Whereas Margaret White controlled Carrie with religion, Sue Ann Ellington brainwashed Genie into thinking she was a cripple. Genie's mother, perhaps, if you want to be generous, thought that nobody would laugh at a girl with disabilities. Was Sue Ann, at the outset, protecting her daughter from wholesale humiliation by the student body with some wheelchair as a prop? It's a moot point, because when Sue Ann sees her second chance at being the popular girl, she makes the added calculation that nobody would laugh at the mother with a dead daughter.""Ma"", in a nutshell, reinvents this story that pops up from time to time on the newswire: The teenage girl who gives birth in a bathroom stall at her high school, then throws the newborn away into the closest dumpster, because she worries that the responsibility of raising a child would interfere with her social life.Sue Ann wants to party like it was 1989.",Ma

She easily switched from being that nice old lady who lives next door to that psycho killer next door in a matter of seconds. She was probably the only good thing in this movie. All of the other actors you could tell were trying their best with what they were given but it just ended up being really boring to watch. Diana Silvers was probably the best one out of all of them. Now, I'm not going to put all the blame on the actors for this because even though this movie is one hour and thirty-nine minutes long it feels like a two-hour long movie. The film feels really slow throughout the entire first act and doesn't pick up speed until the last little bit. This wouldn't be a problem if there was something interesting going on but there wasn't. The characters were either at Ma's house or doing something in their everyday lives and this isn't a spoiler because it's in the trailer. I feel like this film would have been better as a short film than a full feature-length film. A lot of the scenes in this movie also just awkwardly ended with no purpose. One thing I do want to mention is that if you are interested in watching this movie do not watch the trailer because the trailer spoils pretty much everything in the movie. I will not say what scene from the trailer it is, even though if you watch it you can easily figure it out, gives away the entire ending to this movie. In the end, this movie really isn't worth a watch because the trailer spoils it and it's only worth watching for the last 10 to 15 minutes. I give Ma a 5.5/10.",Ma
161,mmuggi,Ma dear Ma,6,15 July 2020,"Horror thriller that has earned the box in relation to its consumption. Horror / thriller production company Blumhouse.In short, Ma is about a group of young people who find a place with an adult woman where they can party. The woman is lonely, and starts partying with them. But when the small group of young people we follow pull the handbrake and do not want to party on weekdays, the woman starts pushing, resulting in the film's 2-3 act.The film was not shot on location, but great cinematic emphasis has been placed on the film taking place in a small suburb of Ohio. Ma is played by Octavia Spencer, who won her Oscar in Niceville, directed by Tate Taylor, who also directed this film. The film has several relatively large actors in the film, who have gone relatively much under the radar. In addition to Octavia Spencer, both Allison Janney and Juliette Lewis also play. Then there are the young actors, who to me are totally unknown, and to that extent also seem un-experienced.The film itself is quite generic and reminiscent in construction of a previously rather mis rated thriller thriller in the form of Stalker. Olivia Spencer is not sharp in the role to start, but she falls into place in the role during the 2nd act.The film is very conventionally shot, except for a few shots in the 3rd act, which is nothing short of a staple, especially a single shot I clearly remember.One partly understands Ma (Olivia Spencer's) motivations, which one learns through flashbacks. It also gives the film its twist.All in all, a movie you can easily see, but Blumhouse has not invented the deep dish with this movie.

Because the movie is a Blumhouse Productions, it will have jump scares, since this is the only way Hollywood knows how to make horror movies, without being creative or original.Sadly i can't say any positives to the movie, since it failed in many of the aspects (except the sound, so that's why the movie doesn't get a 1/10): the music is forgettable; the characters are average at best; the dialogue was awful; the acting was weak and at the same time was terrible with some very awkward conversations and in some moments the actors felted very uncomfortable on the set and you can tell by watching it; the editing was not impressive and the camera work was OK.It was a weird and awkward experience that even Octavia Spencer, who is a great actress and proved it already - couldn't save it and unfortunately she is miscast in the movie.

While they love it at first, the movie slowly reveals that Ma is far from normal.It was honestly one of the more disappointing movies of this year, almost as disappointing as Jordan Peele's Us was. The only good part about the film is Octavia's portrayal as Ma. While I was skeptical that she could work a role such as this, she manages to come off as friendly and charismatic at first, but she also masters coming off as homicidally insane. The other cast members also did a serviceable job. My only issue is that most of the dialogue that the teenagers had was too unbelievable. No adolescent would speak or say the same words that the actors playing Maggie and the others did.The rest of the characters were unlikable. Aside from Ma, Maggie, and maybe a third and fourth character, the majority of the cast of characters are greatly underdeveloped or come off as rude and mean-spirited. This is bad because when the inevitable happens to them, you can't really care because the movie didn't give you a reason to fill anything for them. Even with Ma, she comes off as less interesting because of how the audience already knows that she is insane.The film also suffers because of predictabilities. Once you figure out the route that the movie's going, it becomes tedious as you just sit there waiting for the inevitability to come. It employs several clichés common in horror movies such as the characters making idiotic decisions or jumpscares.Overall, can't recommend the movie. It'd probably be best to wait for it to come out on home release.",Ma

167,helenbassett,Ma Film Review - Tate Taylor Directs Octavia Spencer Serving Up The Misery For The Sins Of The Fathers,9,10 June 2019,"Octavia Spencer is the veterinary assistant to fellow Oscar winner Allison Janney's vet, in small town America. A woman who never reached her potential, and whose lack of high school partying experience is hard to forget. But Tate Taylor directs the meek mannered Sue Ann as someone who has accepted her uneventful life and she'll have more of the same.Until Juliette Lewis's Erica drives back into town with her daughter Maggie. Diana Silvers, looking like the young Anne Hathaway, was all over social media when I was on holiday and she's in both Ma and Booksmart. Two different views of high school. Erica's life hasn't turned out exactly as she expected after her divorce, so she's back to her home town and Maggie isn't at all impressed with the place after her LA life. But she takes a chance on an invite to a party with some new school friends. To be honest a little unlikely she would get such a quick invite from the cool kids with her in her dungarees, 'Nice overalls Janine!', although Diana does rock a pair of dungarees. And okay it's not a party, they're actually going to buy alcohol and just get drunk. But hey that's what high school is for. Having fun with your mates.But first they need someone to actually buy them alcohol. And the good people of nowhereville aren't. Until Sue Ann recognises the van being driven by them as belonging to one of her old high school party gang. And well she remembers partying in her youth. For old times sake she buys them the drink. Although she anonymously tips off one of the dads played by Luke Evans, just to let him know that his kid is out drinking. Thoughtful.With their hideout blown the kids eagerly accept Sue Ann's next offer of more drink, and invitation to party safely, and conveniently, in her basement.If only our teenagers knew what kind of fun Ma is going to have with them. And when the other high school kids hear about it they too want in on the cool gig. Sue Ann is killing it in there with her shots and dancing. But there's something not quite right about the set up at party central.A schlock horror that camps it up in style, Octavia Spencer really utilises her access to the vet drugs and she's clearly flying high as a kite. But the sad thing about revenge is that the kids of her youth may have been the high school jocks and princesses of their day, but their lives are now just as rubbish as everyone else's. And their kids are going the same way. Still that's not going to stop Sue Ann as she shares a beer to reminisce with Luke Evans. Her first love. And there's no forgive and forget in this story.Be nice to the other kids is the motto here, one might end up a drunk, but the other might turn out to be a homicidal maniac with a big knife and a cupboard full of drugs.Look out for 'Breaking News In Yuba County' by Tate Taylor coming soon. Another Oscar potential after The Help. Until then Ma is an entertaining amuse bouche.",Ma
168,fairlesssam,Enjoyable but Forgettable,6,23 February 2020,I went into this film not knowing anything about it. A group of teenagers badger strangers to buy beer or liquor for them. They meet Ma who agrees and invites them to party in her basement with the only condition that they don't go upstairs.The kids can't believe their luck and take full advantage of Ma and her hospitality. However things take a strange turn when they annoy Ma and don't follow her rules.I felt the film had so much more potential. It seemed a watered down version of a real chiller. Ma could certainly have been the next Annie Wilkes. It's enjoyable but immediately forgettable.,Ma

What this movie really evolves around I honestly wasnt expecting. Putting the puzzles together for this movie with Shaunna made it crazy fun to watch. I like it when once in a while u have to pause & negotiate what we think about the movie predicting or failing to do so. Altho a lot of it for me was pretty predictable it was so in a good way.",Ma

Also I think this film more targeting a Greta auditory, because this two films have way to many similar parts, and Greta just have all-white cast, and we have fashion on blacks, so... But! This film actually better. I an admit this. Also like ""Sun also a star"" - just make for grab attention along with almost all-white ""After"", but in the and it was much better even if it was just ANOTHER day in city_name romance film.

Other than a small amount of blood shown, I don't call this a horror movie. A few jump scares in between scenes, a very creepy, lonely lady and some high school kids looking to party is all this movie is about.
It had so much more potential. If they really wanted to call it horror, I don't know why they didn't add more into the scenes. I'm not sure, maybe I'm just desensitised to horror movies. But I don't think I'll watch this one again.",Ma
173,rustonreviews,"Ma lacks thrills, tension and suspense, resulting in an uneventful watch.",4,7 June 2019,"When Maggie Thompson (Silvers) and her mother Erica relocate to Erica's Ohio hometown, she quickly befriends a new group of friends who invite her out for a night of drinking. After several failed attempts of persuading adults to purchase alcohol for them, Maggie is able to convince Sue Ann (Spencer), a veterinary technician, to help them out. Sue Ann obliges, but is quick to begin researching the group on Facebook afterwards. It isn't much longer before Sue Ann invites the booze-loving group to ""party like rock stars"" in her basement to ensure their safety. Things soon take a dark turn once Sue Ann's true intentions begin to surface, and the kind-hearted, easy-going illusion she projected upon the unsuspecting group is subsequently shattered.Octavia Spencer delivers a solid performance as the highly troubled Sue Ann (A.K.A Ma), showcasing she is capable of much more than the standard, unadventurous roles she is frequently offered. Spencer embraces the twisted cruelness of Sue Ann's tormented mind, and she does so with a sense of deeply disturbed glee. As for the rest of the cast, they're barely serviceable, and some of the dialogue is remarkably cringe-worthy. Ma's biggest issue, however, is its lacklustre script. While there is potential to be found in Ma's simple premise, it's squandered beneath uninspired writing. Plot threads never quite come together in a satisfying way, whereas others are never explored in great depth, resulting in an uneventful narrative that never elevates as the film steadily progresses. Considering that Ma is supposed to be a thriller, the film is dampened by a severe lack of thrills, tension, or nail-biting moments of suspense, and several scenes just scream missed opportunity. When it all boils down to it, Ma never quite gains momentum due to its underdeveloped storyline and uninteresting characters, and the finale fails to provide a rewarding conclusion. Ma isn't awful, it's just painfully mediocre.",Ma

Octavia Spencer is always watchable, and I'm glad I saw it, as it does linger in my memory and haunt me a bit, but, wow, with the ending section going for ""Carrie"" territory, the prior set-up should've had Spencer reaching for Piper Laurie's intensity in that film rather than pulling back.",Ma

Something a little different, psycho thriller sub horror. Meh!Blumhouse Productions used to release some great stuff in the horror genre, but more recently, they are just churning substandard fluff out.I feel that they missed an opportunity here, it could of be good, but somehow went wrong. What could of been creepy, turned out laughable.Octavia Spencer made the best out of her role, but was let down by a ridiculous script.The first 3 quarters of the movie was a snooze fest, leading up to the final act, which fell flat.To sum up without spoilers. Naughty foul mouthed Teenagers (Nothing against them, I was one) drive around and get drunk. Teenagers meet Ma, who buys alcohol for them. Ma tells them they can use her basement to party. More teenage drinking. Ma gets a bit creepy. Small plot twist. More teenage drinking. Party. Another party. Yet another party. Ma gets a bit creepier. Plot twist, all but one of the teenagers believe that Ma is a Psycho woman. Then they do, but don't care, why?! Because her basement is a free place to....You guessed it. PARTY! Another plot twist, gullible teens learn their lesson the hard way ""Insert predictable outcome"" The End!Watch it on DVD. It will pass 90 minutes, and it doesn't really matter if anyone talks through it, because it's just a crazy woman and a whole lot of teenage drinking, party's and not a lot of interesting dialogue.Come on Mr Blumhouse, make some actual decent horror flicks again.",Ma

The back story here could easily fill 15 minutes of screen time , as BABY JANE opened with a prologue decades ago. But audiences were patient then, so the script chooses instead to thrust us right into the teenagers' world of sneaking off to drinking parties. Unless we've seen the previews, we'd have no reason to suspect Ms. Spencer's character of anything worse than being harmlessly wacky in buying their booze and providing them with a ""safe"" place to party. The character of Ma's daughter is introduced far too late in the goings-on for me, but I admit that when the script finally snaps into life, it's like all hell is let loose and seriously bad s-t keeps cracking right to the finish. Nice to see the great Juliet Lewis in another peculiar characterization as the heroine's mom. And Luke Evans does some nice work as one of the flies

Octavia Spencer has done an amazing job as MA her acting is on point that it really something different for her as she tends to play nice down to earth characters, where MA is just extremely shattered from being bullied, she enjoys being in control and being the centre of attention. All the while trying to stalk the kids and their parents and trying to get back at their parents in the meantime who bullied her viciously as kids. She also has a condition of Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy where she as a vet nurse tries to use her skills from that job to self medicate especially when it comes to her daughter as she thinks her daughter has something really wrong with her and the doctors do not see it yet MA gives her daughter in perfect health vets medications in her eyes to try and make her daughter better, which is a symptom of this mental disorder, that is caused from her being shattered with humiliation by the kids parents when they were kids. Diana Silvers has done an amazing job too with her phenomenal acting is so on point her character is suspicious of MA from the start where she frequently asks questions about MA being too good to be true, which it comes in handy to protecting them in turn ends up saving their lives before it is too late.

I'll add that Octavia Spencer's unique method of conveying emotion and creating a literally complete atmosphere through mere facial expression really gave me that edge of your seat feeling the entire time I was watching. She's unbelievable. Then, we have the premise of the story which is MA being the nurturing mother figure to a bunch of shiftless teens. At first, we think she's just a do-good'er being kind and enjoying the prospect of reliving some lost youth. That's about the size of the trailer's introduction and where I will stop as well so far as story line. If I go further, it would reveal spoilers. Suffice it to say that there will be an unexpected twist and unpredictable turn every few moments, so don't take any breaks. I rank a good thriller based on how good Silence Of The Lambs was.

Well, after giving it a second chance it's time to come to terms with the fact that while I didn't hate Ma, It is definitely a mediocre film. With cliche and rather unlikeable characters and a concept that has been done before with much more success in the form of Misery, Ma doesn't seem to bring much of anything new to the table for this type of film.

It's simple tale of a group of bored high school kids in a small town with nothing to do, trying to have fun by getting an adult to buy them alcohol. They are constantly rejected until they run into Ma who at first rejects them, then when she sees the name of the van, she agrees to buy them alcohol and even let them eventually use her basement as a safe place to hangout, get drunk and get high. She relives her high school days vicariously through them and finally feels like one of the cool kids when she didn't fit in when she was in high school. She imagines the cute guy to be the cute guy she had a crush on in high school. When they reject her after she snaps at them for breaking one of her house rules, she becomes unhinged and begins her revenge on those who wronged her in the past.Ma is a chilly tale of a woman whose mental growth was stunted from a cruel act done to her back in high school by the parents of the high school kids. Physically, she is a woman with a mediocre job, house, was married, and is a mother, but mentally is forever that socially awkward teenaged girl stuck forever in high school by a cruel prank she never got over. It was so cruel she tries to stunt her daughter's growth and intentionally makes her sick in order to stop her from going to school and facing the mean kids like she did when she was in high school. For those individuals who have their lives together, this movie is mediocre and idiotic. For those individuals who don't and let the sins of the past become their whole life or no matter how hard they try to better themselves, they continue to fail and return to their hometown and face the ridicule of adult bullies who rejoice in their failure, it's scary accurate and kinda depressing if you are in that predicament.It's a simple movie with so many hidden, deeper meanings. There is even one scene where Ma paints the only black friend of the high school kids in white face and tells him there can only be one black friend. For bullies who bullied weaker kids in high school or elementary school, their lives go on without a worry of the effects of their bullying did to those kids they tormented. Sometimes those kids dust off what happened to them in high school and move on with their lives. Then there are those like Ma, who are forever tortured about being bullied as a child. And the cruel prank done to her was pretty traumatizing. It is a crazy reminder of how as children and adults we need to aware of how actions and treatment of others mentally affects them. Otherwise our children must suffer for the sins of our past.",Ma

Sue Ann aka Ma (Octavia Spencer) comes along and not only helps buy the alcohol but allows the teens and their friends to use the basement of her house to get wild and have parties. If this wasn't already starting to sound weird, things become a little creepy as Ma continually invites teens to her house where no adults are around.Honestly it wasn't that bad, I actually enjoyed it.

200,paulmcuomo,What is this movie?,1,30 August 2019,"I saw this movie a fair while ago. I actually saw it roughly around the time I reviewed Brightburn, but believe it or not, I knew how much more how I felt about that movie than this, which is REALLY saying something.First things first, the biggest thing about this movie is that, despite the really messed up ending, absolutely NOTHING of worth or note happens in this movie otherwise. This is honestly one of the most boring horror movies or thrillers I can remember watching, and once again, it's directed by Tate Taylor.Background on this movie - this movie was developed BY Tate Taylor for Octavia Spencer to allow her to play someone outside of her normal sassy, lovable self, and also continuing the horror/thriller trend he set for himself with The Girl On The Train, and this movie has a bucketload of alumni from both that film and also The Help. You have Allison Janney in probably the most thankless role of her career as Ma's nameless boss who gets killed, Luke Evans plays a womanising prick who dies, and also no-one cares for, and Octavia Spencer tries to play up the humanity and humour in a character that ultimately has zero.Speaking facts of facts here, Ma's whole role in the story, and her backstory, is something that whilst sucks, she also seems to be targeting the completely wrong people over, which hardly builds sympathy, and on top of that, she has a daughter in this film who she constantly belittles and bullies, which again, is hardly going to make her likable.
Also, if you are going to go down the monster route with this character, the mental thing is the big sequence at the end of the film, where she tortures the kids, is done to unconscious people, so if you did come for that side of the film, you too get robbed. Like, what was the goal of the movie, apart from giving Octavia Spencer an unusual role that she doesn't fit at all, and even if she did is so tissue thin that she can't do anything with it?Honestly, I don't know WHY Tate Taylor keeps trying to do movies like this when he clearly as no aptitude for it; he directs his movies in a slow, labouring way that lacks kinetic flow, or even worse is so trained of colour that they're an effort on the eyes. At least in something like The Help, it being set mostly at day can offset that, but in a dark lit movie like this kills it.That's that. A fairly late opinion of it, but yeah, don't buy or rent this movie, or pay to see it.",Ma
201,nehpetstephen,Falls drastically short of what it thinks it's capable of,3,22 August 2019,"According to the trivia section, the role of Ma was originally meant to be a white character, but Tate Taylor made (very minor, almost arbitrary) revisions to the script once he got Octavia Spencer on board. My guess is that he did some similar revisions once he got a big actress like Juliette Lewis to play the main character's mother. There's really no reason why the mother should be a point-of-view character who gets as much screen time as she does. Do we really care about the half-baked subplot involving her career woes and her job at the casino? Those scenes add nothing to the muddled themes (or pacing, or plotting) of this screenplay; rather, it seems like Lewis's agent fought for more screen time, so Taylor came up with some extra lines off the top of his head.Whether that's true or not, that essentially sums up the whole feel of this movie. Taylor directed THE HELP and did a great job of making minor moments and tangential characters feel very lived-in and authentic. He technically accomplishes the same thing here. For instance, the irate woman who tells off Ma at the salon feels like a real, ridiculous person, and the very brief interactions between Ma and her exasperated boss (Allison Janey) carry a real weight of complex history in them. But unlike THE HELP, there's no unified vision to what's on display in MA. Isolated scenes might be interesting and well-executed, but nothing carries over from page to page. By the midway mark, trying to rationalize why the characters just did what they just did becomes an exhausting fool's errand. MA has the panache of a more prestigious, meaningful film, but it has the slapdash writing and characterization of a B-movie, and the disjunction between those two somehow makes the movie less entertaining than it would be if it were simply one or the other.Consider a scene early in the film, when the teenagers first arrive at Ma's basement. Out of nowhere, the cocky, arrogant Chaz (Gianni Paolo) accosts Ma, violating her personal space in a threatening manner while trying to peer pressure her with a dismissive line like, ""Unless you don't want to be cool, that is."" I get that Chaz is an entitled young male, but c'mon, there's absolutely no way in which such a scene would ever really happen. Ma is a much older woman, respectably dressed in the uniform of her healthcare profession, behaving very politely and normally thus far as she provides these kids with an indispensable and easily retractable favor. She's done nothing yet to suggest that she has any interest in proving that she's ""cool"" to a bunch of teenagers. Unless Chaz has a behavioral disorder, there's no reason he would execute such an off-the-rails act of antagonism, which would only be likely to jeopardize future attempts to score booze. Yet he does. At which point Ma pulls out a conveniently hidden gun and immediately enacts a humiliating revenge that is essentially sexual assault. Given what we later find out about Ma, such an outrageous response is in line with her character, but what follows next only cements that the whole scene--the whole movie--is absurd and stupid. She laughs it off as a joke, and everyone else immediately laughs it off and continues with their business like normal. C'mon, kids can be stupid and overly trusting, but not like that. Once a stranger has pulled a gun on you and forced you to strip naked in front of your friends, that would pretty much be the end of the movie.Such implausibilities abound in this movie. By trying to emphasize that their film is psychologically resonant and thematically meaningful, the filmmakers behind MA only call attention to how superficial and stupid their cheap thriller really is.",Ma

They make idiotic decisions which makes everything worse for themselves and, with the right decision, the film would have never turned into what it did.

203,kikoydaba3,"a cautionary tale about childhood trauma, bullying, and racism, though meddling in execution and unable to tap its full potential",6,15 October 2019,"Carried by the nuanced craziness of Octavia Spencer as Sue Ann Ellington, Ma is a cautionary tale about childhood trauma, bullying, and racism, though meddling in execution and unable to tap its full potential.Sue Ann is a middle-aged black woman who parties with high school kids. The story gradually bares her motives as a bullied teenager humiliated by her peers. Unable to experience social happiness during her younger years, the high school kids she befriends are her outlet for that repressed childhood memory. Ultimately, Sue Ann seeks revenge against her peers through their children, the high school kids she parties with, when her past was uncovered. Sue Ann's revenge is most especially directed to Ben Hawkins, played by Luke Evans, her high school crush. Ma juggles themes of bullying and racism together in a satisfying revenge thriller.The same positive review can't be said to the high school kids and Sue Ann's peers who are bland and weak characters. Ma's untapped potential is due to failure in giving proper characterization to the supporting characters. Octavia Spencer carries the film single-handedly.Aside from the film's writing, the direction is quite average except for some creepy scenes such as Sue Ann torturing the high school kids and forcing her daughter to take unnecessary medications.Overall, Ma is good but not contemplative enough to fully appreciate its subject matter.6/10",Ma

I just think that a lot of the plot is hole-filled &/or unnecessary. The fact that she seeks revenge on these people after 20+ years is kinda weird. It's not like she just found out they all still live in the town; she's had every opportunity to kill them so it makes it seem like Ma just decided to wake up and do it one day. Typical Hollywood, though; they have to make a backstory so that mindless viewers have something to justify why characters do things. And by the way, the ""reason"" for revenge is pretty weak; definitely not revenge- worthy.It'd have been much creepier if the actions of ""Ma"" were completely random. The film should've been about a lonely woman who lures children to her house and then tortures them before ultimately getting caught. The End! Don't over complicate it with lame backstory and twists. Simplicity allows for the rest to fall easily into place, and also gives rise to going full throttle with the horror/psychotic elements of the story, which is what most us want when we go to see a thriller in the first place!",Ma

The story of a woman, who just wants kids to have a good time, can be spun in either a helpful or creepy way. Octavia Spencer conveys that terror perfectly. I was legitimately afraid for the kids in this movie; The character of Ma is so mentally unbalanced and unpredictable, that at no point could I see what was coming.
The third act drives it in hard ,and certain moments are gut clenching; I'm terrified of this woman.The story and editing are pretty good. They flesh out Ma really well, and you understand her actions.

I appreciate this a film, and films some times need to stretch the realms of plausibility, but it literally happens non stop with this one.From the very get go, my believability was seriously challenged - A girl from out of town moves to a new school. Within 10 minutes of being there she is approached by a group of friends who immediately invite her to a party and also immediately enlist her as part of their gang. Really? Are american teens that hospitable? Doubt it. Also prior to her joining, that gang consisted of 4 guys and 1 fit girl. Rather unusual combination there.Anyway, that was only a minor implausibility. From there on in, the film goes to implausibility over drive, especially when the title character Ma turns up. Ma herself doesn't make sense, whether at the start or the end. At times, normal and 'hip' and then suddenly psycho and sadistic. There is no journey in-between the two. Also the characters behaviours and decisions (particularly from the gang of teens) in respect to the ridiculous antagonist that is Ma, are simply to silly and stupid to believe and take seriously.None of this plot could exist in the real world, so its difficult to feel any fear or unease, admittedly through, there are some awkward scenes, which at least deliver in some way.Overall, a bit of a stinker.",Ma
220,songbirdmc,So disappointing,5,12 October 2019,"The previews looked pretty good and I was excited for Octavia Spencer as the lead. It's so hard to rate her performance because the film itself is a hot mess. There was so much potential here, but it fell flat on its face. While I was watching I couldn't help but think everyone dropped the ball. Sometimes I struggle between whether the acting is bad or if it's just the bad writing. These actors needed to portray a level of stupidity that was simply too much to ask of the actors and the audience. The film was also very choppy. Thanks to the editing for that one. It felt forced and rushed and there were too many loose ends. When you watch a film you want to be so engrossed in it that you want to forget that you are watching people act. There were so many moments where I felt like I was watching a student film or a bad play. I'm angry. As someone who loves films and horror this was an absolute abomination. It was a let down. It only got a 5 from me because of Octavia Spencer. She did her best with what she was given. It could have been a 10 star movie, but there was definitely issues with laziness or time constraints or something. I hope Octavia gets another chance with this type of role.

The film is told in a way that you spend a lot of time with 'Ma's' Character and it kind of becomes a character study plus the usual type of entertainment you would expect in a film like this. Octavia brings a lot to the table, you gravitate to her screen presence. The 'teenage' actors are decent and do a good job as supporting characters. But this is 'Ma's' movie- it's Octavia Spencer's movie. Storywise, there is enough originally to keep you entertained, plus it has some usual tropes of Horror/thriller genre. The ending is not the strongest, but the rest of the film makes up for it. I really enjoyed the film in the second half when the body count starts spiking.

The romance is forced and unbelievable. The story and characters are under-developed and are not given detail. The film lacks a scare factor/shock-value and the only times the audience jumped were in unnecessary jump scare scenes throughout a campy horror flick.Overall: Besides Octavia Spencer, the cast is throw-away and do not add much to the film making it its own.

248,gatheringsnow,"Lookout Weekend, Here Ma Comes!",5,6 June 2019,"Honestly, this film was just okay, not great but good enough I suppose.
For one thing, I didn't find the film all that scary or even thrilling until the last act and prior to that, aside from some party scenes with cool music I found myself more bored than anything. To me, the film works better as a drama than a horror-thriller film and aside from some performances from the adult characters, notably Sue Ann (Ma) played by the talented Octavia Spencer in a role we've never seen her in before, as well as Juliette Lewis who plays the mother of the main teenage character Maggie, and to a slightly lesser extent Luke Evans as the unlikable father of Maggie's ""boyfriend"" Andy, the acting was not all that great or memorable.
For one thing that stuck out to me was so many open ended questions or plot points which were never fully resolved by the film's fiery climax, such as why Ma had all of those creepy African tribal masks in her house, what her daughter Genie's ""illness"" was and why she made her use a wheelchair when she was able bodied, she was actually the most sympathetic and even disturbing character in the film and Ma's relationship with her reminded me of the relationship between Carrie and her mother from the 1976 classic horror film starring Sissy Spacek.
None of the kids, even newcomer Maggie, were sympathetic or likable, especially popular girl Haley, who was incredibly nasty and annoying. While it is revealed that Ma is a very lonely and disturbed character her plan to get back at the parents through their kids is very cliched and I was able to predict most of the events in the film before everything went down. It seems like the film was trying to be more compelling than it actually was by borrowing heavily from earlier horror classics, from Carrie to even A Nightmare on Elm Street with the parent child revenge theme, and it wasn't able to pull it off convincingly. It seemed like it didn't know what it wanted to be in the end and that's ultimately what kept it from being great which is a real shame, especially in regards to Allison Janey who was relegated to a role as an unlikable obnoxious boss veterinarian to Sue Ann. She honestly would have been better playing one of the teen's parents in my opinion. Ultimately it's not the worst film I've ever seen but it's FAR from the best.
Also, I REALLY enjoyed the ending song playing over the credits, to me that was almost more entertaining than the entire film itself!",Ma
249,spacegirlsunday,Do they really think so little of us a viewers?,1,24 August 2019,"The actors in this garbage should be embarrassed!!! Every second was cringe worthy and not in a good way!! It's impossible to like ANY of the characters. Every one of them was just terrible and everything they did was nonsensical and stupid. Rational, logical thinking is a thing if the past apparently. The scenes are pieced together in ways that don't make sense. There are no answers to the why's until it's way way to late to care and then the ultimate reason ""Ma"" was doing it all to begin with was such a joke. It was like some kinda cheesey bad dream scene from a 1994 made for tv mean girl movie or maybe a side sequence on 'Family Guy' showing it as an awful after school special that's making fun of how stupid and bad it all is. This is most definitely not something you'd ever think you'd see in an actual ""horror"" movie with actors of this caliber. Not any movie actually. Nothing, nothing in this made a lick of sense. And how can they actually call this a horror or a thriller anyway? What it really is is a perfect example of a vast double standard that society has created for men and women who spend time with under age children inappropriately. Even once the kids knew she was trouble, they continued to do the same things like nothing before had ever happened. It's craziness and it's frustrating, annoying and embarrassing. This generation of kids thinking they are just automatically equal to and with adults then talking to and treating us that way is just the worst. And this movie, instead of calling it out, actually tries to make you root for these terrible, vapid teenagers. And the end... with the blood, what was that about? No pay off! No answers that will give you a sense of Justice served Carrie style! The best scene is the old lady in the nail salon. That and the Mercedes truck scene were at least laughable... and not because they were meant to be either. Ughhh so disappointing and unsatisfying. What did the director and this production company have on these actors to get them to do this? For a budget of only 5 Mill, had to be something because there is no way they did it for the art! Zero stars. Do better Hollywood. It's insulting that you even released this mess and this movie is single handed proof that we need to just create an awkward/uncomfortable in a terrible way so avoid it genere for garbage exactly like this to find it's rightful place. Boooo",Ma
250,yogsottoth,Bold and entertaining,5,27 May 2020,"First of all Olivia Spencer is too much for this movie. She's such an amazing actress, she brings class to everything she's in. I loved watching her as the antagonist.The movie itself is of course lame and has that TV movie quality however at times it was quite daring and interesting too. It might be nothing like you expect.*Spoilers*A middle aged woman hanging out with teenagers, and being attracted to them, wanting to be popular with them - without the revenge plot - was extremely interesting. Such a sad portrait that hasn't really been explored before. Also what happened to Ma at high school hit me hard. It wasn't your run of the mill bullying, it was a devastating prank that can destroy a person's soul, I believed it could result in delayed adolescence and explain her compulsive need to be liked by teenagers. I really liked that.I just wish the kids' realization of Ma's weirdness happened more gradually as she got creepier and creepier. It felt kinda fast and forced to me. One moment they're best friends and the next she's shoving them into walls and they block her number. I think they should have emphasised her need to be popular among the children of her high school tormentors, not her revenge plot. Did she hang out with them to hurt them in the end? Was she gonna kill Ben and Mercedes if she didn't run into them? I didn't really understand what her whole plan was.Also did we really need a Munchausen by proxy daughter, I don't know. I could do without her, her character and their relationship wasn't exactly explored well so it felt like she was just there to cement Ma's craziness and save everyone at the end.I really liked the idea, I wish it was more grounded and slower. Fun watch nonetheless.",Ma

255,pjlb2008,It's a small world,4,28 June 2019,"Pleasant enough to watch it as it develops. Then the wheels come off. Reminded me of the typical Lifetime movie. Starts good and turns into a slashfest with many people murdered by the disturbed person. The plot is absurd and contrived. Maggie and her mother, Erica, move to a city. Erica takes a job a the casino. While working at the casino, she runs into Ben and Mercedes. They used to be best friends as kids! Mercedes gives Erica some ribbing for working at the casino. Meanwhile, Maggie goes to school and meets a girl in a wheelchair. She just happens to be Ma's (Octavia Spencer's) daughter. A few cool kid meet up with Maggie at school, including Ben's son. Wow, small world! They need alcohol. Someone walks by and agrees to buy it, Ma! What are the odds? They go drinking in Ben's van. Later, Ben needs his dog groomed. Takes the dog to ... Ma. Not planned, just coincidence. No other dog groomer in town? Small world!
Ma has a bittersweet history with Ben and provides the motivation for her Freddy Krueger schtick. . She was smitten by Ben in high school. Ben pulled a prank where he said he was going to meet her in school closet so they could mess around. But it was a nerd instead in the closet! When she came out, the whole school was there laughing at her and the nerd! Like it would have been so much better if the whole school had been waiting when her and Ben came out of the closet.
Ma's debauchery would last 10 minutes in this world of social media. I don't think dozens of kids would be able to go there week after week without authorities and parents getting involved. I did not buy the ending. No one would act like Ma acted.",Ma

Tate Taylor draws on the excellent Octavia Spencer for this horror thriller as fun as it is disturbing.Sold as yet another teen movie, Ma comes out of the lot with a pretty original character and an interesting evolution. The script will certainly not surprise fans of the genre but it contrasts quite well the releases of the moment and ultimately turns out to be quite fresh. All the young actors make various fortunes in the game but in the end it goes pretty well. The tension and embarrassment go up little by little and it's pretty nice until the expected ending, a few scenes leave a mark and you get out of the session not really tested but satisfied with the final rendering.For my part, I enjoyed it even if we have to admit, Ma has nothing truly exceptional.

It keeps you guessing and predicting right through to the last moments of the film.It's not spectacular by any means and it's not the greatest film in the world, but please believe me, whatever bad reviews you've read, just watch it with a nice glass of wine and a cuddle with a loved one and I promise it is such a treat!8 is all I could give.

267,ChrisMIN43211,The Quest for Attention,6,30 June 2019,"The need for attention becomes a dangerous thing in ""Ma"", where Octavia Spencer reunites with director Tate Taylor.The story begins with teenage Maggie and her mother moving from California to a VERY fictional version of Sandusky, Ohio (leaving out a very specific place- probably at Universal's insistence). Mom Erica (Juliette Lewis) quickly is employed at a casino, Maggie is enrolled at the high school, instantly gaining the attention of the cool kids, and becoming part of the group. It's when they're trying to get alcohol for a party that the story kicks into high gear. Sue Ann (played by Spencer) is the individual who comes through for the teens, who aren't legally able to purchase alcohol. Sue Ann, burdened by her boss (Allison Janney, in an uncredited cameo) at veterinary clinic, decides to stop being on the outside looking in, and integrates herself by providing a hangout spot in her home. Unbeknownst to them, she's looked up a few of their social media profiles, once Sue Ann recognizes the name on the van being driven by Andy.
I wanted to love how Spencer's Sue Ann went about having fun, which is highly improbable, but as the movie progresses- and more about Sue Ann's past emerges- what can be tolerated will depend on the viewer. Juliette Lewis and Diana Silvers (as Maggie) are a believable mother/daughter duo, while McKaley Miller and Corey Fogelmanis stand out among the quintet. And from Taylor's previous movie- the otherwise disappointing ""Girl on the Train""- Luke Evans portrays a local who has a connection to Sue Ann.6/10",Ma

But what I got was the same character she played in for The Help but the only difference she is a killer which failed flat on so many levels. This movie could've been good had the director pushed in a different direction but what we got was a predictable plot and a stupid ending that left me feeling like I wasted an 1 hour 30 mins of my time watching this garbage of a movie. I am very disappointed by the ending and feel like the writers were too lazy to even think how to end this movie on a high note.,Ma

They're just mad because a black woman is the leading actress of this thriller. Yes, some of the previews from the movie kind of spoiled a few things, but you have to look at the acting, camera direction, and plot twists throughout the movie that weren't in the previews. A lot of people (including me) in the theater were reacting throughout the movie with humor, fear, gasping, and applauding.

273,princess-fairy2010,Really good!,8,1 December 2019,I personally really enjoyed this movie. I think Octavia Played her roll perfectly and really just did a great job. I really enjoyed the young cast as well. I think this really showed the affects of being an outsider and post trauma. The only thing I was confused about was the whole thing with Ma's daughter. I get they're trying to show that Ma is crazy but I wasn't quite sure how that fit in with the story. In my opinion they probably could have done without it but still overall a great film!,Ma

It is never scary enough nor is it funny enough. Octavia Spencer hams it up for 30 grueling scenes and then collects her paycheck.

And all the kids are basically nothing and hollow teens with no defining values or characteristcs but this isnt about them its about MA. Right?

284,jeremiahlhorton,Be Openminded and Enjoy,9,2 June 2019,"I won't lie, the only reason I went to see this was because Octavia Spencer is playing a totally different role than what I'm used to. I honestly thought it was one of the better Blumhouse films considering they have new low budget films every other month or so that are either pretty good or just really bad. It's a psychological thriller with horror elements and it's a little predictable. The acting in this film was hands down VERY good in the aspect of it being low budgeted and it's probably one of the better films to watch and enjoy of the decade. Just about everything in this film especially with the high schoolers is pretty relatable and slightly cliched to how dumbfounded high school students can get when their minds are overpowered by their agendas even when the consequences are clear. What I enjoyed most about the film was that the story was pretty straight forward and made you either really felt sorry for the the antagonist or really hated the antagonist. There are a few jump scares, extremely disturbing scenes, and a simple backstory to the antagonists Motives and reasons to her doings. There also isn't much to take from this film besides never trusting strangers and never drink around them. The only downfall is that the film should've been rated PG-13 since the cast was mostly younger adults/teens and there's no gore and only mild vulgar language which I've heard in various PG-13 films. Even though it's a psychological genre, it is fictionally education to underaged humans who want to party, get wasted, and not be aware of the people and their surroundings. I give it to Blumhouse being the film production company to bring decent films that are enjoyed by most audiences. All in all. This film gets an A- from me!",Ma

If you still want to be cool and let them watch it, watch it with them please and be alert during Ma's flashbacks and any time actor Luke Evans 'aka' Gaston is on screen, especially if he's tied to a bed, and you should be good. Other than all of that this is a good story. Ma or Sueann is an odd unique villain in the horror/thriller/suspense movie genre. The most appealing thing to me about this movie is how raw and intimate it feels. No big budget. Not too many big stars. Just a good ol' story told in a well-written way, and performed well also. The plot is weird and interesting and plants you in your seat with your eyes glued to the seat wanting to see what twisted thing Ma does in seeking out her revenge. I do recommend this for the strong story but I do wish there wasn't any unnecessary nudity and did nothing for the story in my opinion, but still go watch it.",Ma

Even after they realize something is off about Ma, they continue to party at her house? Then two of the characters decide to sneak into her home because they ""think"" she might have stolen from them.I think the dumbest decision is when the main character, Maggie, steals her mothers car keys and sneaks off in the middle of the night to Ma's house because she was sent a video of her boyfriend hanging out there once again. Mind you, this is AFTER her mother grounds her for BEING at Sue Ann's (Ma) house in the first place!

Also the character writing is very well done - even minor players are interesting and far from being a cliche teen flick, it conveys a ""slice of life"" really well, despite the initial setup being one we've seen so many times.Well worth a watch if you have ""horror film fatigue"", I found it to be something refreshing, entertaining and well put together.

It is a well-made thriller obviously geared at younger audiences. The characters are believable and likable enough. While all the actors' performances are solid the reason this film is worth watching is Octavia Spencer's stand-out performance in the title role. This is monstering at an Anthony Perkins, Anthony Hopkins, Kathy Bates level and it lifts the whole film from a run-of-the-mill programmer to a proper, eminently watchable thriller.
I always like it when horror films connect with the audience by reflecting their genuine fears or feelings of unease instead of using some outlandish conceit. MA does this very well by on the one hand tapping into the teenagers' misgivings about underage drinking and on the other hand subtly but very effectively making use of race issues in the USA.",Ma

Not much happens for a verrrrrrry loooooonnnggg time, and when it does start happening (after a fashion), it's still pretty boring.Juliette Lewis sounded like someone else was using the family brain-cell throughout the film, bad casting and worse-er acting.Towards to end it did at least become fairly funny - only because it was so silly it reverted to a bit of a comedy.There-in lies it's only fair point.

For a minute when they first introduced Sue Ann's daughter, I thought she was going end up being the result of a rape suffered during Sue Ann's teen years, but that would have made her too old to be known by the current-day teens.The Munchausen's by proxy twist was interesting, too.",Ma

Sure there are a few over-the-top moments, but why does that matter? Not every movie needs to be Oscar bait. It's creepy and menacing, just like it's supposed to be.Obviously, Octavia Spencer nails it as a former high-school wannabe, who struggles with breaking free from her past. Naturally most people like her wouldn't take it this far, but I'm from a small town, and that post high-school trauma is very real for a lot of people. And this being a horror movie, why not exaggerate a few things and have some fun with it?Juliette Lewis also deserves a mention. She does not have a lot of screen time, but surely makes the most of it. I can not understand why she isn't getting better parts, in even greater movies, because she is fantastic.7/10",Ma

The casting and characterization were great, even if teens in horror movies make continually bad decisions, it felt somewhat realistic for the majority of what they chose to do. There were several choices the writers made that I think could have been altered or just removed entirely but I don't think it detracts from the integrity of the plot. I'd recommend it, although it's not breaking any new ground it's still worth a watch for an interesting story and watching someone go totally nuclear.",Ma

She's supported by a fantastic group of newcomers and some fantastic veterans who never disappoint (Allison Janney, Missi Pyle, Juliette Lewis, and Luke Evans). Still, this is Spencer's show through and through. She runs an entire gamut of emotions throughout Ma's nearly 100 minute runtime.The plot is typical B-movie silliness. A group of party-loving teens persuade a lonely woman to buy them booze, but in exchange, they must promise her to only drink it in her basement. Obviously, this being a horror film, this woman has ulterior motives up her sleeve and things soon get creepier and creepier.There's not a whole lot new here, but Spencer keeps the film alive with her grounded, yet campy performance.",Ma

So when she starts murdering everyone I just felt like it wasn't her character and think the film could have got away with maybe one murder and not a main cast. It was all a bit strange. Octavia is amazing as Ma and I always forget what an amazing actress Juliette Lewis is. Five stars. Bit slow and For me was painful to watch someone I felt sorry for become a monster.,Ma

There are so many in-your-face instances of foreshadowing in the beginning of the film, that it's fairly easy to guess what's going within the first 15 minutes. It's a sloppily written script, to say the least, especially in terms of the build-up throughout the film to discover what the grand incident was that scarred ""Ma"" for life. It could have been a much better script if the writer spent more time developing the characters a little more sensibly, rather than focusing on getting alcohol for minors every few minutes. The ending was also horrifically over-the-top. I didn't find myself caring for any of the characters and their fates. It's like it all seemed to morph into this strangely unintentional John Water's SERIAL MOM vibe. Everything resolved itself in an ironic and comical manner, and had me feeling as if I honestly didn't care about any of the characters or their fates.",Ma

328,kennybelliveau15,Major pacing issues making avoiding cliches impossible.,6,22 September 2019,"Octavia Spencer was amazing. There was no denying that. Her talent and her willingness to participate whole heartedly deserved a better script and a more fitting thriller. It begins strongly, establishing Sue Ann/Ma as troubled and harbouring her own secrets from her youth.During the second act it trails off and never find the right footing again. Once the secret of why they shouldn't explore the rest of the house was revealed Ma and everything about her lost the edge and the thrill. It mixed one too many ingredients to try and and sweeten the mixture. It became a troubled teenager, troubled parent, disturbed person film all rolled into one without diving deep enough in any of those aspects to make it worth doing.The backstory was predictable and very much unnecessary at the same time as it took away from the potential to shock by having to visually display what was going to be said through dialogue anyway. The twist was less of a twist and more of a confirmation that there was always more to this.It was the typical Blumhouse production with a garden variety mixture of drama, comedic elements and the weird and whacky while never quite figuring out an identity. It tried to be modern, hip and reflect our time by having Ma stock them on social media. All the parents seem to be absent minded until the plot calls for them not to be. Everyone seemed inept at acting logically which is a troupe in horror but usually works best when flipping convention on its head.It had the tools and the cast that could have displayed more. Allison Janney was under used. Luke Evans and Juliette Lewis were also grossly underused while Diana Silvers and Corey Fogelmanis were forced upon us as the youth without any developed personality other than they wanted to get messed up at Ma's house.The horror genre has seen bigger heights than this. This was one of the film's that seemingly missed on all accords. Wanted and expected more.",Ma

The film was suspenceful throughout and definately had a unique concept. The main thing I didn't like was the link between Ma and the group of kids parents. I thought it was quite cliche and instead of it being a revenge film, I would have prefferred her character bring the kids to her basement to party due to her loneliness and lack of from her childhood.

I didn't have high expectations for the movie so I think that's why I enjoyed it as much as I did. Some scenes went from a 0 to 10 very quickly that made me think it was slightly unbelievable but it's not enough for me to not recommend. I didn't like Maggie - the main girl. I don't even know her name and I'm not going to look it up. She irritated me and I don't know if it was her as a person or if that was the character she was playing.

Octavia Spencer's performance was awesome, I felt the characters emotions and reasoning behind the actions - she portrays in a realistic way a person with psychiatric mental disorder. On the other hand, the performance of the younger cast of the film was weak, I felt no sympathy at all for the characters. They have no development, nothing major is happening.

I get it - kids get tricked but this movie is wrong on every level. I went to a very white and then de- segregated school growing up and this this scenario is fabricated , not interesting, not worth being cobbled together as a movie and maybe should of been some loosely conjoined millennial's YouTube video attempt at social justice .

During the movie I got really bored and looked down at my phone to see how much time had gone by and to complete and utter shock I looked down and there was an hour left. I was with my fiancé and I turned to him and told him ""hey there's still an hour of this movie left"" and we both laughed in shock in unison that the movie wasn't close to over yet. So yeah the whole time me and my fiancé both kept wishing and hoping the movie was close to over and it never felt like the ending was going to come. I KNOW I still gave it a 4 and my review sounds like a 3 at best. I gave it a 4 because Octavia Spencer wasn't bad with the terrible script she was handed.

I just saw this today, and I am not regretting it. Blumhouse does have a bad film making rep, but that's because they focus too much on the unreal. This movie focuses on a fear that not many horror movies do nowadays: fear of reality. All of this stuff in the movie is possible. The possibility that you will be at the end of somebody's twisted revenge plan is a fear that all of us don't wanna believe, but we have to when we are actually in this situation. The 3rd act is the icing on the cake. The tense feeling builds up, the fear amps up, you may even shed a tear. Is it the greatest movie ever? Hell no!

It seemed like Ma's daughter was supposed to be a big reveal but it felt anticlimactic because by the time we see here again I've forgotten all about her. Even when her first scene comes up it didn't seem like she would be a memorable character to keep an eye on.

Juliette Lewis is great and looks fab and I was pleased to see Missi Pyle in a supporting role. The marvellous Alison Janey is also featured in the movie and the worn-down, bitchy boss.

This movie should be called, actually: ""Octavia Spencer killing it and deserving an Oscar for playing that character that Octavia Spencer played in that 'eh' film that Octavia Spencer just reigned"". She own the film. Furthermore, the film had a really good potential, not only because of the AWESOME, BEAUTIFUL, SPOTLESS job that Octavia Spencer delivers it. But, as we're getting used to see in terror movies nowadays, I dunno. There was so many things that could be explored, the movie lifted so many questions and possibilities, then! ...the director decided to go on with the easiest, poorly, unsalty way. EVEN when Octavia Spencer was just faultless, impeccable. I was so into the movie, 90% due to...Octavia Spencer acting; but the script let me, like: ""OH MY GOD, WHY THIS IS HAPPENING, THIS CAN'T BE REAL"" - but in a really sad way. If I could rate this movie in a separately way, I would give, naturally, 10 to Octavia Spencer; 3 to the movie and the others characters at all.It's the opposite of ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"". Ma delivers great acting (by Octavia Spencer), with poor storyline. I wish that Octavia Spencer was there to save Autopsy of Jane Doe.

Beautiful way to explain the scene and emotions involved.All the actors do a pretty good job, in the whole, this movie is not pleasant but it is good and kind of scary.

You actually don't learn a lot about the main characters, they're very simple and have not much dimension.The antagonist is on the contrary a lot more lovable than you would expect from seeing the trailer. She may even have a bit to much layers of development. You get to know her through flashbacks that show her terrible past and why she does things, but it makes you feel bad for her.The story is something that looks like it's out of the ordinary, but is actually closer than you could possibly think, which makes it a lot more compelling and intresting to watch from the side perspective. A lot of people had multiple bad experiences in high-school and want to take revenge or just redo the high-school experiences of partying. The way the story unfolds is also something they've thought about a lot, its fun yet creepy but not scary.The acting of Octavia Spencer is also very on point, only her face tells enough. The acting of the kids is a bit less, but still not bad at all.

I liked that it was predictable. It's about a group of teenagers that want to fit in and disobey their parents, they obviously won't be making the smartest decisions.
It was scary in the way it's so possible in real life. It doesn't have any supernatural elements that make it surreal, it's creepy and weird because it could happen in real life. I loved the realistic reactions the characters had to certain events. Even if the dialogue seemed odd sometimes, it was good acting and wonderful cinematography that kept the movie on its feet.

I felt that it relied on typical horror cliches, such as the bullied high school kid becoming a villain and the bad guy being right behind you when you turn around. Octavia Spencer delivered a creepy and unsettling performance, but it could have been even better if the script had been stronger. I was underwhelmed by the performances of the younger cast, but I would blame that mostly on a weak script and poor character writing. It was nice to see Blumhouse obtain some A-list actors, like Luke Evans, but I felt that they did not even try to have a script that used his acting skills anywhere close to their potential. The movie contained some genuinely scary moments and themes, but it fell short of being an original movie that lingers in the brain.",Ma

The conclusion (which is the most important part, the part they should have payed a lot more attention to) is so rushed.The story will surely grab your attention, the flashbacks that explain why Sue Ann does what she does are gonna keep you curious till the end.. their timing was just perfect, and even though the plot has its upps and downs it must be appreciated for its interestingAlso most actors did their job perfectly (Octavia Spencer, Juliette Lewis, Luke Evans, Diana Silvers and Tanyell Waivers) yet the rest were obviously less talentedNow to the most important part (the timing) , they could have covered a lot more events instead of showing what the kids are doing all the time, the story is about Sue Ann, and the characters that are engaged with her past should have taken a better, longer role, Luke Evans for example played a key role (the cause) yet his character(that could have added a lot to the movie if it were given more time)didnt show but in few short scenes....the way she killed mercedes couldve been a lot more epic, they couldve shown Sue ann planning the killing at least not bring it out of the blue...Dont listen to thoes telling you its a bad movie, its good but it could have been better..",Ma
437,aheadatherest,Should I Keep Watching,8,4 July 2019,"Honestly, I think that the daughter of Su Ann should have been between her and Ben. I would have like the director to play with their chemistry a little more. Make it seem as thought there was "" Something there' outside of the prank. Maybe they've had a connection after that entire ordeal of embarrassment that made the current Su Ann open to the idea of starting a new relationship with Ben after all those years The audience could tell that she still liked him. Yet, Im very confused with the kiss between Su Ann and Cory. Did he end up liking her or was he playing into the situation? He didn't even try to fight her off. Drugged up or not, Im sure he seen his friends tied up. Futhermore, I dont think that an African American daughter would ever stab her mother. I think pushing her towards the fire would have been enough. Even her being caught on fire while climbing in the bed with Ben would have been a nice ending. As crazy as Su Ann was, as a viewer, we know that there will be a second part to this. All in all, this movie was entertaining from start to finish. We were blind completely when it came to what was upstairs. I dont know why I wanted to see more up there. It was interesting to know that she had a daughter, but I was expecting something more like her daughter to have three legs or something, you know..",Ma

440,devinmsapp,"Octavia Spencer is great, everything else not so much",3,20 June 2019,"Ma is yet another small budget product from Blumhouse that doesn't quite aim to impress as much as earn its budget back and maybe then some. I was really excited to see Octavia Spencer tackle the role of Ma: an adult with a seemingly teenage-like energy and party hard mentality, with a far more sinister brain under the hood.She does not disappoint. Spencer is jaw droppingly freaky in this movie, managing to steal your gaze anytime she's put into frame, whether it be in the foreground or background it doesn't matter. Watching her facial expressions perform a balancing act between perverted affection, distrust, and no nonsense psychotic rage is a real pleasure, and no doubt the best part of this movie. Diana Silvers also does a really good job as our protagonist who also happens to be the only teenager in this whole movie who isn't a blustering idiot. Every time terrible things are happening around them, in typical horror cliche fashion right before things go really crazy, everybody just goes 'yeah but I'm not worried about it.' Well they should be! I was bewildered by their ceaseless stupidity decision after painstaking decision. Unfortunately, because the supporting cast wasn't given a lot to work with, their performances are just par, possibly sub-par.The film isn't very interestingly shot, and any time it's gearing up for a jump scare, the camera does that rare and out of place 180 degree pan so that you know exactly what's coming a mile away. The movie is never scary, and doesn't even provide thrills until the last twenty minutes of the film. And without spoiling anything, the very last scene where Ma is interacting with one other character, it's such a damn letdown. Shock value is all this film really has going for it, and the second to last shot of the film should have dropped my jaw, but it's done in such a safe uninteresting way that the credits rolled, I got up, and never would have thought about the movie again if not for this review.",Ma

444,jesse-44951,Not scary,3,9 December 2019,I was really looking forward to this movie but it turned out to be a bust. I found the characters to be kinda ditsy and not all that engaging. Story was kind of lame.,Ma

Of course it had usual tropes like the popular kids, the unusual girl, the party scenes and raunchy scenes. But the ma really did weird me out.

Slow burner, interesting back story, good enough acting (Octavia fantastic). Just towards the end a few things went a little stupid. Why didn't the girl just attack Ma at the end, she didn't have the gun out.. instead of taking that picture of them? She would have also died quickly whilst being hung. The lad would have bled out after being stabbed too. Also Ma got stabbed and then just walked off like nothing happened.. cut the silliness out at the end and this would have been a pretty good film.",Ma

But this was SO BAD I just had to.Idea of the movie was not original but decent. However, the script & execution was god awful. It started okay but went downhill very fast. To summarise, this is an insult to human intelligence.Only positive thing about this movie was Octavia's acting as a deranged person hellbent on revenge. I am not going to judge her character's behaviour because she was obviously crazy, and crazies do what crazies do. The dialogue was still very dull though.Non of the other characters made ANY sensible decisions, even when there were glaring evidence of creep factor related to Ma. They had zero sense, no gut feelings/6th sense. It felt the characters were making the decisions they were making just to keep this unconvincing plot moving forward.Oh and the creators decided to sprinkled in Munchausen syndrome as one of Ma's issues in there and left it at that. School was totally okay with that, too I guess.Adults got murdered left and right and no one looked into that.Whoever created this must have been holed up somewhere without any human contact for their whole life and suddenly decided to give film making a try.Luke Evans and Allison Janney was completely wasted on this pile of garbage. I wonder if they along with Octavia were blackmailed into star in this. XD.",Ma

455,thehacker7401,A well delivered role!,7,11 June 2019,"The plot itself is very predictable, like the flashbacks to when ma was a high school student herself. It was very clear from the beginning that it the whole story was around something like that. Octavia Spencer keeps amazing me with her roles since that mood swing from happy to psycho and vice versa perfectly suits her. Her expressions and that ""empty"" stare she sometimes gives really tells a lot. Although i feel like something was missing from the film. Personally as far as my taste goes, i've learned to expect more gory stuff from movies of such kind and that's why this one was a bit dissapointing.",Ma

Nothing makes sense. The only, in so many mistakes in the storytale, i will mention is the ending: Ma's daughter goes down to the basement and helps the kids knocking out Ma but then they're trap in the same basement... they all suddenly wake up and forget the stairs.

I had wanted to see it since I first saw the preview just to see the amazing things Octavia Spencer would do in a movie like this. But it had also seemed like maybe the trailer had given away too much. I went tonight and my wife and I were genuinely uncomfortable (in a fun way) the whole time. The movie holds suspense and tension really well. We had a great time...I recommend this fun, creepy movie!",Ma
465,dave19067,"Solid thriller, good balance of story and scares",8,3 June 2019,"Ma delivers what it promises to the audience. I would categorize it as 50% thriller, 25% horror, and 15% drama, and 10% comedy.Acting is solid overall, teens act like teens of today and even use the same exact phone apps. A few stupid decisions are made, but that's to be expected for a horror-thriller.Of course, the main villain played by Octavia Spencer forms the centerpiece of this movie. She perfectly injects bits of comedy, creepiness, and compassion whenever the scene requires it. Beneath the veneer of middle-aged female charm lies a cold, demented, sadistic monster.Although not a true horror, horror fans such as myself won't be too disappointed because scares and gore escalate in the final third of the movie. Some parts are pretty hard to watch and disturbing, but aren't overly gory.For the comedy aficionado, there is a lot to gain from watching this movie with rowdy friends. Ma's over-the-top personality, wit, and sayings have already created inside jokes and memes that will withstand the test of time.The backstory of why Ma is a monster ties in the plot pretty well, but reduces her creepiness-factor because it allows us to sympathize with her. I wished they would have revealed less of her backstory as this would have upped the horror element.Trailer does reveal too much of the already predictable plot, unfortunately. Don't expect any interesting twists or insights to make this a guaranteed rewatch, however Ma does a near-perfect job of tying in different genres into an entertaining package.In my opinion, this is a classic that belongs in the same light as ""Us"" and ""Get Out""!",Ma
466,shaunzramone,Yes! Watch it!,8,29 November 2019,"Give it a go it's really cool. It's a fresh take on this type of ""something isn't right"" type of movie. Octavia Spencer does so well to create that chronic unease, that constant feeling of something is not right. She also creates empathy for her character & I love a bad guy that can do that. Definitely worth a watch.",Ma
467,flyersfanatic-51751,Y'all Mad at Me for Something?,10,31 May 2019,"I will keep this review spoiler free...but just wanted to share some thoughts on what was a surprisingly good movie. Octavia Spencer plays Ma with shocking empathy - even when things take a dark turn, you cannot help but to feel bad for her (sort of wish there was just more time spent into Ma's rapid decent into murder). Additionally, I wish the movie explored more of the ""themes"" surrounding Ma and her daughter. However, as a whole, this movie is FUN. Saw it on 'opening' night Thurs and the theater was packed - we laughed, we gasped, we applauded, we collectively held our breath during that ONE scene. I went into the theater expecting trash, I really did. However, I was pleasantly surprised and had one of the more fun movie-going experiences that I have had in a long time.Go in with minimal expectations and I think you will leave satisfied. Octavia gives it her all, but the rest of the cast is solid as well (despite a weak script at some points).Go see it and make sure that you DON'T MAKE MA DRINK ALONE!!",Ma
468,jataylor-16668,"Almost there, but not quite.",6,16 June 2019,"I love Octavia Spencer, so naturally, I had to give ""Ma"" a view. The idea was interesting, however I believe that they spent a bit too much time on the back story rather than the suspense. It felt more like an underwhelming Lifetime Channel movie. With that being said, I wish they would have put the screenplay through one more draft for development. In the end, the final act of the film was pretty well done, and applause to all involved. Give it a watch and form your own idea.",Ma

The ONLY jump scare in this film occurs about an hour in and that was it. Wasn't really much of a jump scare, actually, and did I mention is was the ONLY one? Then there is a weak SAW movie scene that ends up being more like a PG-13 thriller where some teens get slightly stabbed or have their lips sewn closed (sounds worse than it was, and none of the teens were killed). Octavia Spencer must have agreed to do this movie because they gave her an exec producer credit.",Ma

But after she Mets a pretty boy she snaps?? And why she had a daughter like gypsy ?? Nooo, also copied their story ( the mom with munchusen syndrome ) ""I'll cut your hair cos it will fall "" and don't do anything, -.- nothing make sense.. the daughter of Juliette Lewis there looked smart and seems to have a good relation w her mom, told her about her bf but whyyy nobody has a house for parties !!!!

481,sikumikku,It was... Something not that bad,5,14 June 2019,"It was a good time watching this, but felt like it was trying so hard to get a grip on the audience, whatever that was. This movie was destined to appeal to a young audience, overall. But its theme and 'teachings' were kind of dumbed down. Some video elements were graphic or intended for the mature viewers, though. Its kind of a mess, really. Of course, the movie grabs your attention through the soundtrack 'thats the Shrek 2 song' or 'Kung fu fighting' and kind of gives you a too relaxed and cheesy vibe.I get that the whole point of the movie was to manipulate in you into trusting Ma and her kindness, only for the action to go downhill really quick and shocking. But the ending was, again, cheesy and not too terrifying. Also overall dumb, and too sped up, overly simplified for the sake of having a bloody ending.Some characters were totally forgetable and useless, very forced into stereotypes. The backstory, very predictable, exists only to explain Ma's behaviour. Octavia Spencer's acting was the element that redeemed this movie, hands down.Sincerely, i dont know who to recommend this movie to, perhaps a group of youngsters who dont want to be too scared by a 'horror movie'. It had something of a psychological element and fun moments (?), but not much else. Not the best, nor the worst. Totally average.",Ma
482,iedemrn,When Emotional Trauma is Untreated in Adulthood,9,21 September 2019,"Why did the story of ""Ma"" ironically enough accurately describe the collective consciousness of black people that metaphorically have been generationally raped by colonizers (however one chooses to see them) for centuries and beyond?
I know I'll receive criticisms from both sides of the spectrum claiming that the issue is not that deep or that the main issue at hand is the woman's apparent history of bullying and abuse.
The woman is obviously scarred with her mind set on retribution for how she was wronged during an incident that left her psychologically impaired for decades. Notice how in this situation, she is expected to forget this incident and literally move on like nothing happened. She suffers from a type of PTSD that many black people know all too well - PTSD from the generational consequences of slavery and colonization (and all its derivatives).
It's pretty obvious from the beginning of the movie that this woman is psychologically ""off her rocker"" as evidenced by her need for attention from individuals not within her age range. Her gang-stalking type behavior with minors is interestingly disturbing.
Note how the only individual within the group of teenagers that had enough common sense to alert the others that she was not someone to befriend was the token black friend among the teenagers.
Notice how the black woman during her flashbacks was very introverted within a majority white high school. In the height of her embarrassment, her prior ""allies"" remained complicit in her collective minstrel show. Her love interest that admitted to using her sexually adds a layer of insult to injury that is perceptibly felt by anyone that has been bullied publicly among peers.
It may not seem noticeable to people outside of the African Diaspora but this movie subliminally highlights the bitter taste of being told to swallow and smile for the camera.",Ma

This is a movie that should be presented in every high-school and have a discussion with a psychologist and the students after having the film watched! No more harrassment and bullying should happen among students, cause teens can be really cruel (was working in a high-school). I don't agree with the ""method"" how Ma handled the situation decades later, but I do believe that there are persons, who cannot face their high-school years.

517,isaac-boyd,Just terrible,1,2 June 2019,"I was expecting a psychological horror film. What I got instead was a horrible mishmash or psychological horror, slasher, and revenge fantasy.It wanted to be all three at once, and did none of them well.",Ma

519,darren_masterman,"Good acting, let down slightly by a poor-ish ending.",6,2 January 2020,"I actually enjoyed this film more than I thought, especially impressed with the acting by the lead characters but I feel the directors shied away from what could have been a great pure horror film and went for a more psychological plot.It was a good watch nonetheless and I think we'll be seeing more of Octavia in future.",Ma
520,midwestsunshine,As entertaining as it should have been,7,3 June 2019,"If you're looking for good Friday night mindless entertainment at the end of a long week, this gets the job done. I think people make the mistake of trying to rate movies like this with the same criteria as they would some Oscar-contending drama. Octavia Spencer did an outstandingly convincing job as the secretly psychotic Ma. Was it scary? No, but I didn't really expect it to be based on the trailers I saw. Suspenseful maybe, but not scary. Was it predictable? What low-budget thriller isn't? Was it realistic? About as realistic as a certain ferrous super hero unraveling the secrets time travel in a single afternoon. Was it entertaining? About as entertaining as a certain ferrous super hero and his friends avenging the world in a single afternoon. There were some plot holes that jump out at some of us over-thinkers. However, for those of us who go to the movies purely for entertainment, there was humor. There was suspense. There was good and evil. I sprung for the luxury seats for a girls' night out with my college-aged daughters, and quite honestly, we all agreed we'd do it again.",Ma

526,munkeytutu,One of the Worst Movies I Have Seen In Awhile...,3,11 June 2019,"So bad that I felt the need to write a review about it to prevent people from making the mistake of watching it. I had the lowest of expectations and even still, it was laughably bad.
The very FEW positives: Octavia Spencer did a good job at being creepy. Diana Silvers, an up and coming actress, did alright in her role. There is a pretty funny exchange between Ma and an old lady in a nail salon.That's literally it people.
This movie has plot holes galore and presents IDIOTIC characters. I know highschoolers are a little naive and succumb to peer pressure often, but the notion that they would be so stupid as to return to a stranger's house who has stalked, threatened, and stole their personal items repeatedly just to drink and party?? Are you serious? No normal person is that dense. The only teenagers that seem to catch on to Ma's strange behavior is the girl characters, and they take way too long to do so. Apparently, highschool boys are even worse than idiots. Only motivated by sex and booze. Also, no one has the common sense to call police in this movie.
I will leave out spoilers, but truly this movie will have you baffled at the ridiculous reasonings and decisions.Even more disappointing is when you find out this was directed by the same man who directed and wrote the screenplay for ""The Help"". Come on Tate Taylor, you can do way better than this.",Ma

It's just a bunch of creepy smiles and stares from Octavia Spencer, who is the only good thing about the film, and then there is this extreme burst of violence at the end of the film that comes out of nowhere and has no grasp to anything that happened prior in the film. The film is ghastly and is one of the most useless and uninspired films I've seen in forever. Absolutely save your money and go see something else. I forgot I had saw this movie the day before until my girlfriend brought it up the next day. It's truly terrible.",Ma

543,colinsundin,He was hung damn.,3,2 June 2019,"Octavia Spencer really carries her own. Everything else was pretty weak. The story, most of the actors, the writing, and the editing all really hurt the film most of the time. If you're looking for horror, you'll be sorely disappointed as the first hour has really no scares. The movie has some dumb fun moments but its not worth thinking about too much.",Ma
544,nelnel-35922,I had my doubts,6,1 June 2019,"I am a big fan of psych/thriller movies and was mildly excited to see this movie. From the look of the trailer I had a feeling that MA would be an attempt or shall I say potential to be good but not executed correctly. I would give MA a solid 6 out of 10 because it had some great parts like the main character Octavia Spencer role dealing with mental illness and the tragedy she experienced as a child. I would give Octavia a 10 for her outstanding well-calibrated performance.What MA lacked was getting to the gory stuff and a lot of gaps in logic. The horror is only at the end, it should've started at the beginning of act 2. I understand that this is a psychological thriller and it normally starts off slow, but it wasn't enough to keep me entertained. I like the idea of casting teenage characters to make this horror flick suitable for teenagers and showcasing bullying. Overall it's a perfect Friday night weekend movie more suitable for people in their late teen's early twenties. But for the hardcore psych/ thriller lovers this is a hit or miss.",Ma

550,benjaminjjones,Spoilers,2,3 August 2021,"This could have work if it wasn't for one thing.Why didn't they just phone the police? After all, at the start we learn that the cops don't care much about underage drinking. And there's about 100 kids at the parties, they can't expel all of them from school. Just phone the police!Once I'd realised that it was stupid and pointless. There was no point where Ma reveals that telling the cops would lead to disaster. Usually there's a trap (""tell the cops and I'll reveal that..."" or ""tell anyone and your loved ones will...etc""). But nothing. Nor did the characters hint at any reason why they wouldn't go to the cops. I'm not the writer- it's not my job to come up with reasons why they chose not to do the obvious thing to get out of the situation.So that's it. Badly written. Before anyone says about suspending disbelief, or not having to explicitly explain everything- I agree. Subtlety and nuance is important. But only in films where that's the case throughout. It's disingenuous to see that as anything but a massive plot hole and one that can't be ignored. It would be like a Saw movie where the person can walk out of the trap really obviously but they decide to stay in it.",Ma
