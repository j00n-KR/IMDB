0,Prismark10,Coming 2 America,6,12 March 2021,"Coming 2 America has a joke of making sequels to old movies that nobody asked for.Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) returns to America with Semmi (Arsenio Hall) to find the illegitimate son that he unwittingly sired in the first movie. This is done by new scenes with the actors deaged.Akeem becomes king of Zamunda. As he only has three daughters, he needs to groom his new found son Lavelle Junson from Queens to be the new crown prince. This understandably upsets Akeem's eldest daughter as well as his wife Lisa.Akeem also wants Lavelle to marry the daughter of the bellicose General Izzi (Wesley Snipes) from a neighbouring kingdom. This way he will unite the families of both kingdoms.Coming 2 America recognises that the world has changed since 1988 and has a more inclusive outlook.The subtext being that it is Akeem's daughters who take on General Izzi. It still explores the themes of marrying the person that you connect with.It is a fun filled sequel with plenty of nods to the original Coming to America and other Eddie Murphy films. There is a quick shot of a painting of the Duke brothers from Trading Places (as well as Coming to America.)John Amos and James Earl Jones are just few of the actors who reprise the roles from the original. New veterans include Tracy Morgan and Wesley Snipes who almost steals the movie in what is now for him a rare non action role.This is still Murphy's and Hall's movie. They also reprise many of the other characters they played in the original such as the Barbershop characters who must be over a 100.It is not as good as the original when Murphy was in his pomp but it has some heart and soul. It also has a fair few cameos including Morgan Freeman, En Vogue, Salt n Pepa and Gladys Knight.",Coming 2 America
1,nogodnomasters,Prince of Queens,8,8 March 2021,"Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) discovers he has an illegitimate son in Queens who is to be his heir as his daughters can not rule by law. We first see the son (Jermaine Fowler) interviewing for a job with the son of one of the Duke Brothers (Trading Places). I am sure I missed some more homage stuff. Wesley Snipes plays the well dressed choreographed bad guy. The film is a who's who of black entertainment minus a few under contract to Netflix.The production was very funny. It speaks to woman's equality but not preachy and in that regard I wished they had developed the daughter more. The son was not what I expected. They had him as a techno geek and a small time ticket scalper, but neither one was ever used in the film. I would have expected some gut who was a street smart hustler, using those credentials to pass his tests.Guide: No swearing, sex or nudity.",Coming 2 America
2,kosmasp,Twice the fun (?),7,7 March 2021,"Actually the majority of the movie plays in Zamunda. Which is an interesting break from the original, where it was the other way around. What is amazing, you get everybody back from the original movie - everyone that was available and had a role in the script. And then you get some more people! Like Tracy Morgan and Wesley Snipes to name but two.Really well cast all around, with Eddie and Arsenio playing multiple roles all around. And they don't seem to have aged that much to be honest. New York doesn't seem to have changed much either - except from the hairstyle thing. And while you may be asking yourself ""how are those people from the Barbershop still alive, 30 years later?"" ... the obvious answer is, because they are played by Arsenio and Eddie ... but if that is not enough ... remember: this is just a movie - and a comedy at that.It has its own sets of rules sort of. There are things here that do not work as fine as they were in the original. There is also the being aware element that plays more into the cards of those who don't like the movie: talking about sequels and how they mostly don't work. But for every such moment, you have another great moment or dance from Wesley Snipes ... or any scene with Tracy, if you are a fan of course.The flashbacs work at first and I even thought they included some deleted scenes. But it becomes evident quickly that they just use a deaging software, similar to the one I reckon that they used at the Irishman. Unfortunately it becomes especially evident with Eddies face, where it looks weird to say the least, when he has to do expressions.It may be flawed and predictable, but it also is quite fun, if you let it. You can either roll with it then or just hang onto the original. The choice is yours. The callbacks make it a fun ride though",Coming 2 America
3,paul_haakonsen,A rather unnecessary and way too late sequel...,5,6 March 2021,"Well, I must say that the 2021 sequel ""Coming 2 America"" at least wasn't as bad or cringeworthy as I had initially anticipated it would turn out to be.But a sequel 33 years after the first movie? Nah, that was just not really cutting it. Way too long had passed since then and the original 1988 ""Coming to America"" movie really didn't need a sequel three decades later.The storyline in ""Coming 2 America"" was pretty straight forward, but it had some pretty big shoes to fill following in the footsteps of the 1988 classic. And in some aspects this 2021 sequel fared well enough, but failing at other aspects. And that ultimately made for a mediocre end result.As for the characters in ""Coming 2 America"", well of course it was nice to revisit most of the characters from the first movie, and even with some great and unexpected appearances from people from the first movie. However, the movie's main focus character - Lavelle Junson, the son of King Akeem - well, he just didn't have all that much to offer, and he felt like a shadow trying to reach up to fill out Eddie Murphy's legacy from the first movie. And it didn't catch on, at least not with me. That being said, then it should also be said that the movie actually had an abundance of fun and interesting characters on the screen, both old and new characters.The comedy value to ""Coming 2 America"" was not up to par with the original 1988 movie, and this felt more like a family movie laced with light comedy, whereas the original had much more to offer.Sure, ""Coming 2 America"" is watchable, but it just feels like a bland movie actually. And it most certainly has that very unnecessary feel to it. Too long of a time since the original movie had passed for this 2021 sequel to actually be interesting, appealing or mentionable. For me, this movie came and went without leaving a lasting impression.My rating of ""Coming 2 America"" lands on a very bland and mediocre five out of ten stars.",Coming 2 America
4,CinemaSerf,"""A sequel is in the heir..."" Please, please, please - no!",5,13 March 2021,"Now we've all come across sequels, or remakes - reimaginings or reversionings - and wondered why? Well, this has to be one of the worst in recent times. Eddie Murphy's father - the luckiest actor in the film, James Earl Jones, is dying - but before he goes to spend more of his Darth Vader money, he presents his successor with a son he didn't know he had, who lives in California. Off he goes to fetch this young man ""Lavelle"" (Jermaine Fowler) and his larger than life mother ""Mary"" (Leslie Jones), brings them back to meet his all-female family in his Kingdom of Zamunda and all hell - accompanied by some horrific musical parodies of just about everyone from Gladys Knight to Nile Rodgers, with a bit of John Legend and Prince desecrated too - breaks loose. To be fair to Fowler, he is a good looking lad with some bemused attitudinal charm (particularly at bath-time), and there are some wonderful facial expressions from JEJ as he awaits death/relief from his coffin, but the rest of this just misfires on a pretty much continuous basis. The first film was very much of it's time, and that time is well and truly past...",Coming 2 America
5,view_and_review,All These Super Late Sequels,5,6 March 2021,"What's with the super late sequels? ""Dumb and Dumber To"" coming 20 years later. ""Doctor Sleep"" as a sequel to ""The Shining"" coming 39 years later. ""Mary Poppins Returns"" a whopping 54 years later. And now ""Coming 2 America"" 33 years after ""Coming to America."" Sequels are hardly ever good, so what about a sequel coming decades after the original?C2A brought back just about the whole original cast, even some of the bit characters like the twins who rapped about men wanting to feel their breasts. The movie was like one big reunion which may have been better served as a half hour special on Comedy Central.In C2A Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) finds out from his father's oracle that he has a son back in America. Apparently, before Akeem met Lisa (Shari Headley) he had a drug filled one-nighter with a woman named Mary Junson (Leslie Jones). Akeem is on a mission to find him and bring him back to Zamunda to groom him to take over the throne. This young man, Lavelle Junson (Jermaine Fowler), is Akeem's only son, so, much to the consternation of his oldest daughter Meeka (KiKi Layne), who's been furiously training to take over the throne her whole life, this stranger Lavelle will get the honors because he is a man.Maybe we have to assume, or maybe it wasn't even done, but I never heard one person say ""paternity test."" I mean, we are talking about an heir to a kingdom, I'm sure someone wanted to know if Lavelle was really a Joffer. I watched in stunned amazement as Prince Akeem naively brought back a son and his ghetto mother to Zamunda.
What can I say about C2A? I didn't expect much from it and I didn't get much. Besides being a relic, they were running back some of the exact same jokes with the exact same characters which is a no-no in comedy. Furthermore, C2A was more serious and more didactic than its predecessor. The theme was female empowerment and veering from traditional norms even when the traditions have been in place for generations. How do I know this? They did everything but spell it out. Akeem was handcuffed by Zamunda ""rules"" which wouldn't permit a female ruler though Akeem could presumably change those rules.Predictably he told his eldest daughter that she would inherit the throne and that was just one of many changes he'd make as king. I was thinking, ""If you're so progressive, why don't you get rid of the kingdom altogether and make it a democracy?"" But maybe that's for part three.",Coming 2 America
6,ferguson-6,back again after only 33 years!,6,5 March 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. The wait was 54 years for MARY POPPINS RETURNS (2018) and 35 years for BLADE RUNNER 2049 (2017), and it's been almost 33 years since John Landis directed Eddie Murphy in COMING TO AMERICA (1988). So while it's an unusually lengthy wait for a sequel, it's certainly not unprecedented. Director Craig Brewer is fresh off a fantastic collaboration with Eddie Murphy in DOLEMITE IS MY NAME (2019), and the writers include Barry Blaustein and David Sheffield, who were both involved in the original COMING TO AMERICA (plus other Eddie Murphy projects), and Justin Kanew and Kenya Barris (""Blackish"").The film opens with Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) and his wife Princess Lisa (Shari Headley) being greeted in the morning by their three daughters who wish them a happy 30th wedding anniversary. If you recall from the original, Akeem met Lisa on his eventful visit to Queens, NY. Her father Cleo (a returning John Amos) gave Akeem a job at the McDowell's (not McDonalds) fast food restaurant he owned.A basic synopsis of the story this time is that King Jaffe Joffer (90 year old James Earl Jones) is near death, which would mean Akeem would take the crown of Zamunda. A brewing conflict involves General Izzi (Wesley Snipes taking over for Calvin Lockhart who passed in 2007) who threatens violence if Akeem doesn't allow Izzi's goofball son to marry Akeem's eldest daughter Meeka (KiKi Layne, IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK, 2018), who wants nothing to do with him ... but does have her sights set on being next in line for the throne after her father. A film about Meeka could be interesting on its own. Of course, Zamunda law requires a male heir, and that's the final kicker, as Akeem learns he has an illegitimate son conceived from a drug-fueled episode during his previous trip to Queens.The royal jet whisks Akeem and his trusty sidekick Semmi (Arsenio Hall) back to Queens, where after a trip to visit with all the old characters from the neighborhood barbershop, they track down Lavelle Junson (Jermaine Fowler, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, 2018), son of Mary Junson (Leslie Jones). A flashback gives us context to Mary and Akeem's moment of passion. It's at this point where we also meet Lavelle's Uncle Reem (Tracy Morgan). The Queen's clan then heads back to Zamunda.While there is a story, this is not a movie in the traditional sense. Instead it's a nostalgic trip for a big chunk of the cast, as well as for the target audience. An abundance of cameos will keep viewers on their toes, and any movie that features two of the greatest movie voices of all-time, James Earl Jones and Morgan Freeman, deserves extra credit. For me, there were no big laughs; however, I enjoyed a few good chuckles ... the best being ""Idiot Amin"" (your ears have to work fast in the barbershop). The homage to TRADING PLACES was a nice touch, as was a particular finger wag, and a joke about sequels. It seems odd (given the title) that only a very small percentage of the story takes place in America, but I'm sure many will enjoy the outtakes over closing credits, and a surprise musical bonus after that. Also worth noting is that this sequel gets a PG-13 rating versus the R-rating of the original.Amazon Studios will exclusively release COMING 2 AMERICA globally on Prime Video March 5th, 2021",Coming 2 America
7,Wuchakk,"Fun reunion, but pales in comparison to the first movie",6,7 March 2021,"Three decades after the original film, Akeem (Eddie Murphy) discovers that he needs to go back to America with Semmi (Arsenio Hall). The principal cast members return with some new characters played by Jermaine Fowler, Tracy Morgan, Nomzamo Mbatha and KiKi Layne.""Coming 2 America"" (2021) is nowhere near as good as the first movie (which is probably my all-time favorite comedy), but it is fun to see where the characters are at after over thirty years, not to mention what they look like.There are four things that hold the flick back: It seems like it's in a hurry, peppered with music videos, not to mention it's noticeably goofier than the original. It's afraid to slow down for some compelling or heartwarming drama. When they do, like with Lavelle (Jermaine) and Mirembe (Nomzamo), it works and you start get drawn into the characters, but then it cuts to another crazed scene.Secondly, Akeem isn't as likable or funny here, whether that's because of Eddie's low-energy, mediocre writing or simply Akeem being stifled by tradition, I don't know; probably a combination. Thirdly, the trip to New York City comes and goes so this isn't really much of a Coming to America 2. The focus is on Zamunda, which is fine, but the story needed more interesting ideas and writing.Lastly, I liked Jermaine Fowler as Lavelle Junson; he has charisma, but he pales in comparison to Murphy as Akeem in the first movie. The creators needed to spend more time fleshing out the potential of Jermaine and his character.Despite these shortcomings, ""Coming 2 America"" is still worth catching if you're a fan of the original flick. It's great to see all the old characters and there are some amusing and entertaining moments; for instance, the early bit with Bopoto (Teyana Taylor), which made me bust out laughing.The film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot in Atlanta, Georgia, and New York City.GRADE: B-/C+",Coming 2 America
8,deloudelouvain,"The first one is better, that's just a fact.",6,12 April 2021,"I rewatched the first one yesterday, just to set up the mood for this one and maybe to compare them both a bit easier. There's no question about it, the original was better. In this sequel, which has its moments, there is just too much dancing and singing. It looks like they tried to get as much as possible famous music artists to collaborate in this sequel. Now, not all the music scenes were bad, there was clearly some good choreographer appointed for those scenes, but at one point it looked more like a try-out for America Got Talent than a movie. The story is a bit similar to the first one, just the basics and then they added some new scenes. Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall both still play four different characters and they did a decent job with that. I watched Coming 2 America, had some mild fun, but I can't help to have that feeling afterwards that this movie wasn't really necessary to make. Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall did age well though, with 33 years between the two movies they didn't change that much.",Coming 2 America
9,siderite,"I want to say that it was an ode to Blackness, but I can't.",5,6 March 2021,"Of course I was a lot younger then, but I remember I enjoyed the first Coming to America movie. It was silly, but fun. The sequel is not fun. They brought a lot of the original cast back, they expanded it with celebrities (past) of color, they kept the story similar to the original, but there is no soul in it. It all felt jarring and lame.Not being American I know little of Black culture, but the scenes with the people from Queens felt really awkward to me, with their broken English and their self-centered loud irreverence. How are they not offensive to the audience, especially people from Queens? I remember I was once in this international setting and some of my countrymen started to sing. And they were the loudest people there, proudly shouting that they are Romanians. No one could stop them, no one else could join in the singing or sing their own music anymore, no one could do anything but leave or accept the noise. And I only felt embarrassment, just like I feel about this film.P.S. If you're going to put Bella Murphy in the film to act with her father, why the hell won't you give her some lines?!",Coming 2 America
10,ElMaruecan82,Was that trip really necessary?,5,17 March 2021,"I'm a longtime fan of Eddie Murphy, he belongs to that breed of likable comedians who can make a film that fails without failing by himself. ""Coming 2 America"" succeeds at least in one department: it makes you realize how good he used to be and how good he can be like in his recent (and better) ""Dolemite"". Now, to describe my feeling about ""Coming 2 America"" I will paraphrase Dewey from ""Malcolm in the Middle"": ""I expect nothing but I'm still let down"". In fact, that quote should be the stock answer to all these tiresome trends of rebooting, remaking and sequels or prequels that sprayed all over Hollywood creation like a certain virus in our everyday lives.It's not that the film is bad but it's just a benign nostalgia-driven project that keeps basking in the shadow of the original whose references are expectedly countless. Some are cute like the three old guys' cameos and some downright funny like the promised bride who was still barking and jumping on one foot after thirty years; but unfortunately, the film can't live up to the same levels of fun and the material isn't original enough to be referenced to in ten years. The costumes and set-designs were visually creative but same can be said about ""Cats"".What's the story about? Prince Akeem, now King of Zamunda, has three daughters, he's pressured by General Izzi, the tyrannic ruler of the neighboring country Nexdoria (got the joke?) into marrying his daughter Princess Meeka (KiKi Layne) with his son and thus guaranteeing an access to the throne because Zamunda can't be ruled by queens. At that precise moment, anyone can guess the obvious trajectory the plot will take. The problem isn't that the film takes a long detour through Queens to get to the obvious solution: change the law, but that the solution all depends on Akeem's good will. Indeed, the prince who challenged his own father, who rejected the tradition, wouldn't change the rule. Of course, if he did, there would be no story and maybe the first film didn't need a sequel to begin with.To his defense, Murphy throws in the script a few lamentations about Princes generally changing once they become kings but that aspect left me with an uncomfortable thought: in the end of the first ""Coming to America"", Akeem resigned himself and if it wasn't for Lisa having an afterthought or his father Jaffe Joffer changing the rule, he wouldn't have married the girl of his dreams. Now, why wouldn't he make the same move to let his rather competent daughter fulfill her dream? I started looking Akeem as a hypocrite and I blame the sequel for that. And when he is put in his place by Lisa (Shari Headley) and everybody's supposed to be ""about time!"", I was like ""couldn't that conversation happen before and spare all the trouble?"".But I'm reading too much. You can tell there's a reason why this problem exists: the same than the 'forced marriage' thing, it's the unfair law that must be canceled. That's the point. And so it's a foregone conclusion that Meeka will become the queen. If you don't get that instantly, you've missed many movies of the 2010s (not that you missed much). My suspicions raised with the martial arts fighting sequence with Akeem practicing with his daughters, it was as if Eddie Murphy just discovered the ""girl power"" thing almost one decade too late, making the film dated in its attempt to be in touch with today's trendy streams of inspiration. The problem is that his daughters aren't given much screen-time anyway so the script begs us to root for them while dedicating the whole storyline to the illegitimate son: Lavelle played by Jermaine Fowler.Lavelle is referred with the b-word (the film's most memorable running-gag), the unwanted result of an intoxicated night with one distinguished lady they met in the nightclub. That's the best they could come up in a flashback sequence that provides a few clips reminding us how awesome the original was. Akeem has no trouble finding Lavelle, he's a likable loser who welcomes with enthusiasm the prospect of being a prince, and so does his mother played by Leslie Jones. And so what we got is a reverse formula of the original where you never exactly know whether Africa is honored or mocked, Zamunda was supposed to be an expositional joke to highlight the contrast with America but Murphy handles the matters of succession with utter seriousness while providing the worst caricatures about the continent.That African fantasy is a source of one-note jokes awkwardly contrasting with the whole theme of inequality. Even the romance between Lavelle and a groomer named Mirembe (Nonzamo Mbatha) has to get in that territory. Had the film delivered its share of laughs, that would have made for a more enjoyable experience. It started well but went downhill after the death of Jaffe (James Earl Jones). Arsenio Hall is underused as Semi, Tony Amos add some gravitas to Akeem's position recalling his more progressive mother, and well we have the ""references"" to ornate the rather half-baked comedy and so many musical cameos I felt like watching MTV. The film put me in such a sorry state of mind that when I saw the three guys in the barbershop, I thought they should be logically dead. My spirit was.This is not a bad film because it is predictable, the original wasn't a masterpiece of originality either, but it just didn't have that energy, that gentle silliness the original had (Craig Brewer is no John Landis), it was like Akeem: too pompous and civilized for his own good and so obsessed with rules and the etiquettes he wasn't aware of his own contradictions. I said about the original that it was pure 80s fun, in a way the sequel also exemplifies the 2020s: a lackluster era where remaking what's old stands for newness. Like I said, I expected nothing but...",Coming 2 America

12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Guess who's back?,6,11 March 2021,"Right from the start, 'Coming 2 America (2021)' is markedly worse than its predecessor. Most of its humour misses the mark, its plot is all over the place and it generally just feels a bit subpar. It's almost like two or three movies shoved together, with its attention torn between Murphy's newly crowned King Akeem and Fowler's newly discovered Prince Lavelle. Yet, it still manages to remain relatively engaging and, once it's properly underway, even enjoyable. This is mainly because it brings back the original's likeable cast while also successfully implementing some new players. When it comes down to it, it only works as well as it does because of its well-performed characters. Its call-backs are frequent but not bothersome; it doesn't feel like a quick nostalgia-based cash-grab or anything like that. There's the sense that everyone involved had a great time on set and this actually makes it easier to forgive the thing's shortcomings. Don't get me wrong, it isn't great. I mean, it's not even as good as it should have (and could have) been. It's decent enough, though. It's also never even close to boring. 6/10",Coming 2 America
13,Cineanalyst,"""Sequels to Old Movies Nobody Asked For""",4,5 March 2021,"I was excited to see ""Coming 2 America"" having recently reviewed the original ""Coming to America"" (1988) and finding it to have aged quite well and given that Eddie Murphy's so-called comeback with ""Dolemite Is My Name"" (2019) was a lot of fun, including an amusing supporting performance from Wesley Snipes. But, alas, this is merely a rehash of the first film--literally, it includes quite a few clips and outtakes or restagings from it and otherwise is largely a reworking of the original love-marriage-over-arranged-marriage scenario and a series of cameos from returning actors and characters--with a few hit-and-miss gags thrown in rather haphazardly between musical numbers.The prince-and-pauper and fish-out-of-water formulas are reversed, with the prince coming to the Ruritanian African kingdom of Zamunda from Queens, which is fine except that the picture barely leaves the palace. The result is a mostly stale royal-court comedy of manners. Moreover, Murphy doesn't have much to do in it other than to relearn the wisdom of his younger self vicariously through his illegitimate son and, of course, to play multiple roles in the fashion of SNL skits. Arsenio Hall and some of the rest of the returning cast are also largely wasted as a host of new characters are added, including as enacted by comedians Leslie Jones and Tracy Morgan, as well as Snipes and those performing the new central romance and the daughters. Overall, no matter how many more characters, cameos and music are added, it doesn't make up for a lazy, recycled script.",Coming 2 America

15,The-Sarkologist,"Not That Funny, and Didn't Need to be Made",3,6 October 2021,"What was interesting was that there was a subtle dig at this movie about halfway through, where the protagonist makes a comment about most American Movies these days either being remakes, or sequals to movies that don't need a sequal. Honestly, I didn't find that comment all that funny, which sort gives you the impression that I didn't actually find this film to be all that funny. That would actually be a pretty accurate assumption because, yeah, I didn't find this film to be all that funny, and it is true that it is actually a sequal that really didn't need to be made.Anyway, the film is set at a time where Akeem has now had children, but his is still the crown prince. However, his father is on the verge of death, which means that he is about to become king. In the previous film, he went to the United States to find himself a bride, and he did. The idea was that he wanted to wife that wouldn't hop on one leg and bark like a dog at his command. However, what ended up happening is that the neighbouring kingdom wasn't all that happy with the fact that Akeem didn't marry the woman whom they had prepared for this purpose. Also, they aren't happy that he doesn't have a male heir, but it turned out that when they were in the United States, that he did sleep with somebody, and she gave birth to an illegitimate heir, who happens to be male, so Akeem travels to America to find him.In all honesty, the scenes in the United States are few and far between. In fact, the majority of the film takes place in Zamunda, which happens to be a pretty prosperous African country. However, the military junta bordering them is placing pressure on Akeem to provide a male heir so that they can marry into the Zamundan royal line. A lot of the film also has to do with the new crown prince coming to terms with the fact that he will be inheriting a kingdom.Actually, much of the film has to do with traditions, and traditions that really don't apply much more. It is interesting that when Akeem becomes king, there are many references as to how he has become a lot like his father. It is almost as if that progressive nature has disappeared, and now the fact that he is the ruler, and that tradition bears down on him, he finds it difficult to go his progressive ways. Of course, the pressure from the general is also present, and it turns out that ruling a country isn't all that easy, or at least ruling a country and resisting the pressure that will no doubt ruin its prosperity.However, as they suggested, I really didn't feel that there was any need to make this film. While it is interesting to revisit Akeem, it also felt that there were aspects of this film that basically retrofitted the previous film. On the other hand, the scene at the job interview was quite interesting, seeing where the Duke brothers, and their company, landed up. The thing is that even though Coming to America was not a direct sequal to Trading Places, the suggestion was that they do exist in the same universe, and of course the responses from the son were quite interested. However, in the end, this film was rather bland, and despite the subtle hints at how Queens had changed due to gentrification, it really don't stand out in my mind.",Coming 2 America

17,Thanos_Alfie,Nice sequel...,6,13 March 2021,"""Coming 2 America"" is a Comedy movie and the sequel of ""Coming to America"", in which we watch Prince Akeem going to America again in order to find his long-lost son. He has to build his relationship with his son and control his kingdom.Since I had already watched the first movie I knew what I was about to watch and expect by the second. In comparison with the first movie, this one is less entertaining but still funny and watchable. The direction which was made by Craig Brewer was good and he followed the pattern of the first movie and he succeeded on connecting them very well. The interpretations of both Eddie Murphy who played as Prince Akeem / Clarence / Saul / Randy Watson and Arsenio Hall who played as Semmi / Morris / Reverend Brown / Baba were very good for one more time. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jermaine Fowler's who played as Lavelle Junson, Wesley Snipes' who played as General Izzi and Nomzamo Mbatha's who played as Mirembe. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Coming 2 America"" is a nice sequel and I recommend everyone to watch it but first I suggest you to lower your expectations otherwise you will be disappointed.",Coming 2 America

He brings back so he can prepare him to be prince.It is a nice come back with Eddie Murphy in one of his original films. The humor is still fun and has hilarious moments. It is nice to see a sequel made from this original comedy film. Without changing too much what the original lovable.Eddie Murphy returns along with several cast ensemble from the original which is great and a fun comeback. Some new cast members like the actor that plays Lavelle and a few others that was also good.It does have some entertaining value watching Akeem prepare Lavelle for being prince. While Lavelle gets close to his assistant groomer while he is being put in a arranged marriage to Wesley Snipes daughters to unite two kingdoms.What did not work? After waiting for so long for a sequel. I feel like this film is more focused on Akeems son. Who steals the spotlight. While Eddie Murphy is more on the side line to his own movie.Overall, it is a fun film and worth the wait.",Coming 2 America
19,eddie_baggins,A bland affair that shuns its stars into the background,4,11 March 2021,"Arriving 33 years on from the release of the original well-liked Eddie Murphy fish out of water comedy event Coming to America, it's strange trying to review this belated sequel that has come our way courtesy of a much-hyped Amazon Prime streaming release, as this film could've been a lot worse, but it also could've been a whole lot better.As soon as fans heard about the return of Murphy as Prince Akeem and the barely sighted anymore Arsenio Hall as his trusty offsider Semmi (with both actors bringing back some of their side characters for the sequel) expectations were certainly muted as there haven't been many success stories of reviving 80's/90's comedies for sequels over the last decade and we can be thankful that when weighed up against some other properties such as the Dumb and Dumber sequel or even some of Murphy's other works like Norbit/The Adventures of Pluto Nash, Coming 2 America looks like The Godfather, but that's about as far as one could go with praise for this adventure that never nails down a reason to exist.Most glaringly being an issue for director Craig Brewer's film (reuniting with his Dolemite is My Name star) is the fact that this story of Prince Akeem discovering he has an American born child that will become the heir to his country known as Lavelle (played rather forgettably by Jermaine Fowler) is the fact that its two main attractions Murphy and Hall are given very little too do outside of the films opening act, with it feeling as though we have been given the short end of the deal when it comes to seeing our two charismatic and chemistry strong performers play off one another.Despite throwing in a number of new additions alongside Fowler like Leslie Jones loud-mouthed mother to Lavelle Mary, Tracy Morgan as Lavelle's uncle Reem and bit parts from the likes of Wesley Snipes and KiKi Layne, the film suffers badly from a lack of Murphy/Hall screen-time and just isn't that funny or interesting when it sets its sights on becoming a more seriously minded affair about staying true to ones self or not losing sight of cultural beliefs/traditions and its a shame the film focused more on weird song and dance numbers rather than giving the spotlight to its two proven commodities.It's never fun when films such as Coming 2 America do nothing but retread familiar ground and its nice to see that Brewer and Murphy didn't just send Prince Akeem and Semmi back to America for another oddball trip but in this particular instance it would've been wise for the film to stick more with its elements that have worked before rather than try to add a whole bunch of new color and flavor (or cringe-worthy song and dance numbers) that leaves the viewer with nothing but sore eyes and a bad taste in their mouth.Final Say -There have been worse comedy sequels born in Hollywood over the run and Coming 2 America does have a few brief moments of good times but overall this is an as expected to be unneedful addition to the story of Prince Akeem and his compatriots.2 Lion whiskers out of 5",Coming 2 America

Now Akeem must travel back to Queens to track down his long lost son and make him the new heir of Zambadia.Overall i enjoyed this film. Sure it's not really set in America this time only for 10 minutes but I thought it was good.I always loved Eddie Murphy and I was glad to see him back on the screen again. The only gripe I had was where did Akeem's daughters come from? As they weren't in the original one since that was about how Akeem met Lisa.

24,subxerogravity,Solid Gold!,7,5 March 2021,"Big shoes to fill and they filled them nicely. A lot could have gone wrong waiting 33 years to do a sequel to one of the most iconic movies of all time. It would have been better to do a sequel two or three years after and have that fail, but 33 years, now that Coming to America is officially a classic!? People would never let that go.So let's get this out of the way, Coming to America is a classic. You can't touch Coming to America. What you can do is make a really funny movie. I would expect this is what it would be like if Eddie Murphy actually started doing stand up again. We all worry if he could possibly top what he did 30 years ago and forget what we were talking about cause we are laughing too hard.For someone like Eddie who was joined with a big ensemble cast of who's funny, I knew making us laugh could not be a problem. What did take me off-guard was how heart warming the film was. It's just like the first cause while the main story, or the one they advertised, was about Prince Akeem discovering he has a son back in Queens that is heir to his thrown (Despite fathering three more than capable daughters with Lisa McDowel), Coming 2 America has a similar love story to it's original. It also has a huge theme about the love of family which I dug.Like most sequels that come out decades after it's original, the movie is littered with references to the original, which did not wear me out as I thought it would as I was really happy to see so many faces from the first film. I will say all the jokes from the first film are in this film and are updated for 2021 (all except one bit that I guess makes sense cause it's just too 80s (you'll understand when you see the film).They added all the old characters they could (Rest In Peace Marge St. Claire). I mean they even called back Garcelle Beauvais who was barely an actress when she had a small part as a flower girl in the original, just to be a full fledge actress now doing a cameo still tossing those flowers. All that and they had a big stable of new ones they had to put in the mix, but it works cause everyone was funny and charismatic.The great modern day fairy tale did not even need and update but it got it and it was great!",Coming 2 America
25,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,9 March 2021,"I don't really want to call the first one ""EPIC,"" mainly because a lot of people are probably rightly going to point out that it isn't one of the greatest movies ever made... but if you are my age, you were a kid when it came out and it was one of the childhood defining movies of your youth. Everyone watched it, everyone loved it, and now it's one of the movies that, whenever its on, there is an obligation of nostalgia to watch....... so when I heard the 20+ year after sequel was coming out, I was scared. At least they were not remaking it, but it was a disconcerting announcement. They are never good...... and when was the last time you remember Eddie Murphy being funny when he wasn't an animated character? Boomerang? What was that, 92? And he wasn't funny in it, he was more tolerable. He was better than Beverly Hills Cop 3, but he wasn't really funny.And, he's not in this. He's kind of recycled and that is about it. We saw it before, in the first one, when the characters were less annoying and Eddie Murphy was the God of 80s comedy.Now it's a reminder of how far people can fall.And what makes it worse is that you remember the first one, you remember how funny it was, how entertaining it was, and that sweet memory makes this recycled annoying mess all the more painful to watchI don't know, I think the problem was Coming to America actually had a touching romantic story behind it... and Coming 2 America forgot that and just thought it was Murphy and Hall doing a bunch of characters no plot needed.",Coming 2 America

The storyline follows King Akeem who discovers he has a son back in the United States he was completely unaware of. He has his son and baby mama flown to Africa so he can form a relationship with the future king. This movie is directed by Craig Brewer (Hustle & Flow) and stars Eddie Murphy (48 Hrs), Wesley Snipes (Demolition Man), Arsenio Hall (Harlem Nights), Tracy Morgan (Cop Out), James Earl Jones (Star Wars), John Amos (Vanishing Point) and Michael Blackson (Next Friday). The storyline for this picture was just okay but the movie was more of a homage to the original than a serious movie with a few nice cameos by past and present stars. The content was hilarious and I found myself rolling at several segments. I appreciated the film not taking itself seriously and trying to match the greatness of the first film; and instead; honoring it.

27,alindsay-al,A Poor Sequel,3,5 March 2021,"So after over 30 years the sequel to Coming to America has come out on Amazon Prime and here is my review for Coming 2 America. The premise of the film sees Akeem have to travel back to America to find his long lost son and build a relationship with him so can can become his heir.Main Character
Eddie Murphy is back as Akeem and I think he is just okay here. You can't get away from the fact that he is Eddie Murphy and he has a bit of that charm still there and by the end of the film you get back to kind of liking Akeem. But I really felt like he sleepwalked his way through this film, he isn't very funny at all and maybe Murphy's long break from acting came into play here. It also doesn't help that Akeem is made to be pretty unlikeable here, it is for the convenience of the film but it just doesn't feel right and it turns you off from him completely.Supporting Characters
Onto the best part of the film and that is Wesley Snipes, this guy is clearly giving his all and is actually the one that felt like he was having some real fun with his role as the opposing general. I know the reports that he can be a bit tough to work with but when he is like this he is somebody that is a great asset for any film and I am still holding out hope he can have a role in Marvel's new Blade film. Arsenio Hall is back as Semmi, and he is good, I mean that man hasn't aged a day in 30 years and seems to enjoy his rare outing on the big screen by giving a decent performance. Shari Headley, James Earl Jones and John Amos are back in smaller roles and they are all decent in their roles, even if I wish there was more of them. But it is most of the new cast that I didn't like, Jermaine Fowler plays Akeem's son and I really didn't care about him, he just comes across as a really arrogant person and for me never really becomes likeable and I never really cared about his relationship with Akeem which is meant to be the main part of the film. Also I like Leslie Jones and Tracey Morgan but I didn't like them in this film and they just came across as more annoying then funny.Story
The story is really poor here, most of the characters are more unlikeable here. As I said the connection between Akeem and his son didn't work for me and the dynamic between the characters never grew and I never found myself caring. The film also kind of goes against the original film, the characters haven't developed anywhere near enough despite it being 30 years.Script
Now for a comedy, the main thing I require is to laugh and I think I laughed a total of twice here, one time right at the end and during the end credits. The film is just not funny, it feels forced and poorly written with the drama not fairing much better. It isn't a film with really any twists and turns and that worked for the original film because it had charm and was funny but this film has none of those qualities.Style
Now one of the things that I liked in this film is that it spends more time in Africa and it added something different to the film in a positive way, with a nice change in scenery. But like its predecessor, the film is too long and its pacing is pretty poor a lacklustre script not helping.Overall
Overall, this is a poor comedy. It is just a sequel that should never have happened and is one that will hopefully be long forgotten. Even if you are a fan of the original film give this one a miss so that film can stay fond in your mind.",Coming 2 America

It was not bad at all and I enjoyed it.The African monarch Akeem learns he has a long-lost son in the United States and must return to America to meet this unexpected heir and build a relationship with his son.Unlike the first film , most of this is played out on Akeem's African setting and it doesn't lose anything for the fact that there's not the "" In America "" situation.This is a whole heap of fun . Not unlike one big party . There are lots of surprises and guest appearances from musical artist from the 80's and if you are as old as me it can't help but put a smile on your face .We also see the same characters from the first film and it's great to see the old men from the barbers shop .The star of this though is not Eddie Murphy or Arsenio Hall but Wesley Snipes who plays General Izzi, the rival of Prince Akeem .

33,TheFearmakers,Not Much Without John Landis,2,7 March 2021,"The original COMING TO AMERICA was no accident. It took experienced filmmaker John Landis to pull off what he did for THE BLUES BROTHERS, which came out before working with Eddie Murphy in TRADING PLACES: That is, blending music into comedy without it being a musical-comedy, and very few directors could pull that off, and this sequel is proof... they still can't.It's understandable that the semi-retired Landis isn't on board, but in trying to recreate that same magic originally sparked by the collaboration of Landis and Murphy with only an older, overweight Murphy on board just doesn't feel or look right...The biggest problem is his son from Queens, Jermaine Fowler, with a loud, annoying mother. Then again, their Bad Sit-Com style fits this contrived sequel more than the once-great Murphy, again alongside sidekick Arsenio Hall, who, like all the other familiar faces, seems to be going through the motions. The only new characters that kind of work, allowing Fowler's ""young Prince"" to stretch beyond the intentionally recycled plot, is KiKi Layne as his half-sister, reluctantly aiding in a dangerous task...And Nomzamo Mbatha as his royal hair-cutter and basically the new version of Sheri Headly: a free-thinking bride to change the age-old rules.

35,jadepietro,Going Nowhere,4,7 March 2021,"IN BRIEF: An unfunny comedy that wastes the talents of Eddie Murphy and company.JIM'S REVIEW (NOT RECOMMENDED) It saddens me to say that Eddie Murphy is a tired retread of his former comic self in this tired retread of his former hit comedy from the late 80's, Coming to America. The title upgrade is more clever than this sequel. Yes, it took over 30 years for this second coming. One can only hope that another installment of the Coming to America franchise remains on the drawing boards permanently and the third coming is past gone.This labored sequel has an intriguing premise that never comes to fulfillment. Prince Akeem of Zamunda has no male heir to the throne and his kingdom is being threatened by a military dictator, General Izzi (Weslie Snipe). So he goes off to America with his trusty aide Semmi (Arsenio Hall) to locate his recently discovered male successor Lavelle Johnson (Jermaine Fowler), a product of Akeem's drug-induced one night stand, Mary (Leslie Jones) from his previous coming in America.The screenplay-by-committee is evident from the start with only fitfully funny moments on display. Blame can be aimed squarely at the movie's writer team of Kenya Barris, Barry W. Blaustein and David Sheffield. They abandon the stranger-in-a-strange-land formula that made the original so delightful and instead focus on the story of the newly found prince and his formulaic romantic coming-of-age journey back in Africa. It's all smutty innuendoes and well-worn gags despite some engaging performances.Mr. Murphy can also take some of the blame as the film's main producer. This movie need a lot more than major rewrites; it needed major re-thinking. This is the type of movie where the crew must have had more fun making than moviegoers will have more fun enjoying. Director Craig Brewer assembles his large cast, many whom reprise their roles, and puts them through the paces once again, but his own pacing is off this time around.Most of the cast is waylaid by the material it was given. Some actors were unharmed in the making of this movie: Mr. Fowler has a nice screen presence as the Lion King, Nomzamo Mbatha is a fine love interest, and the aforementioned Ms. Jones and Mr. Snipe try to breathe some life in their one-dimensional characters. As Akeem's wife, Shari Headley has her moments and John Amos is solid as Akeem's father-in-law. The esteemed James Earl Jones has a short but sweet role reprising Akeem's father. As Princess Meeka, the eldest daughter and real heir to the throne, the talented Kiki Layne is wasted in her underdeveloped role. However, there is some truly cringe-worthy acting from Tracey Morgan as Lavelle's uncle and tons of cameos by many Black entertainers that pad the story with lavish musical interludes and no real humor.Granted, a few scenes which do provide some entertainment value and hint back to the earlier more successful predecessor that involve Mr. Murphy and Mr. Hall's multiple supporting performances, under heavy layers of prosthetics. Their comic talents shine in these sequences. (The make-up department does wonders too.) But they and the majority of the ensemble are adrift in this alleged comedy that settles for the predictable and unfunny.When the costumes upstage the actors and the story, one knows something is terribly amiss in the disappointing comedy, Coming 2 America. The sumptuous costume design by Ruth E. Carter deserves a better film. So do we. (GRADE: C-)",Coming 2 America

REVIEW:The Return to Zamunda starts off with some powerful music fit for a Disney Animation film and promises the movie is going to be fun and potentially epic like its prequel. Fortunately, for me anyway, the music keeps to the levels I expect with matching the scenes in this film depending on what part of the world we are in. Rap songs and some old 80's hits come to the Queens as sort of a blend of modern and classic movie meeting together to bring us back to the fun. While back over in Africa rap and the powerful cultural music do their own dance as worlds begin to bleed over and try to establish a new world order. Throw in several classic numbers with a fun parody vibe to it during an early scene and you get my appreciation for using the music well to help bring the scene out to its full potential and maybe even dance. A step up from the original, the dance numbers of the movie have their own energy as well, each having a different style and goal depending on where you are in the movie. Comedic stints with Wesley Snipes meeting sort of show the mockery of the character, while another brings some impressive statements and attitude as they try to lure characters into an agreement. Comedy and power aside, the numbers are fun and show the potential of what the movie can bring with the right writing and focus. Key word potential.
The comedy is okay in the movie and had me chuckling at times, but the movie surprisingly took more of a playbook from the love aspect of the first film and had better quality in this sequel on this approach. Coming 2 America has some good morals baked into the writing, some of which are really well done and not too in your face with the common tropes that are the focus of many movies in this day and age. Some of these morals are what make some of the sequences amazing, the well written dialogues and movie magic coming together really selling the moment and showing how Akeem's family could really be expanded upon. I'd have liked to see more of these moments in this film come together like these moments and again deliver that fun and power the first did. As for nostalgia, well there is plenty of it as characters travel around in their journey to find their solutions. It won't take long to dive into the relics of the past, some of the scenes literal rip offs from the movie that were then well integrated into the mix and felt welcome into the mix of old and new. Fans of the series will be very happy with who they have brought back as nearly everyone from the first installment returns, and you can wait with baited breath as to which person will return in the 2 hour block party. And much like the first film, there are bloopers to come in and make you laugh (which for me was one of the funniest moments) as they show the struggle can be real during the filming process.However, the struggle is also real in how poorly this movie came together for me compared to the first. Like many of my fellow reviewers, the plot was not the same Cinderella story I had fallen in love with in the first movie. A forced story that could not find its footing, the second chapter tries hard to balance the generations into a culmination in hopes that nostalgia can carry it further. The result is a mixed plot where each component is used in bite sized components, but not in a manner that is fun. Just as we start hitting that stride though, they seem to change the focus and the jumping around between new stories and old stories, nostalgia vs. new characters, and politics vs. just entertainment. It led to a weaker finesse in the story, and neither generation really executed their roles to the full potential. In addition the characters are unevenly used, a cavalcade of comedians and dressed up characters that are so jumbled in their focus you feel like you just went through the free sample tables at a grocery store and that's all. For a series whose characters are very impactful, kind of important to keep them ingrained, but Arsenio hall's character in particular seemed the most limited of the bunch. The nostalgia factor is there with these characters, but this movie failed to integrate well, taking pot shots at the most random times as they tried to force every cameo into the limited run time. McDowell's restaurant worked very well, but the barber shop, the rival country, even some of the old arguments were so jumbled and lost in the hectic story that it left me sort of annoyed with the blast from the pasts.
The comedy as well suffered for me in this film, torn between old and new generation trying to find a style for all, but again executing poorly. Think about the first film, the writing was naturally, the timing was much better, the lines more unique, and even more so relying on the actor to maximize the delivery without pushing too hard. This movie though lost that and tried to force so many comedy styles in with the nostalgia, that the crammed aspect did not make me laugh nearly as hard. Verbose shouts from half the cast, cocky arrogance and swagger that were supposed to be funny, but were more annoying for me, and lines that were a bit too random to feel natural to the dialogue and story. Extreme things like this lose their touch with me because they don't feel natural and get in the way of an already challenged story that they needed to be on their A game. As if that were not enough, the politics in the story sort of pumped the brakes of the fun mood, hoping to once again put the hot topics into the film to interrupt the natural flow of the movie. While not as bad as some other films, this second installment made part of the plot about the topics on the news and had it been the main plot and integrated all the characters into it... you would have had a winner for me. Overall, the focus of the film was off for me and that is what I think made this film suffer for so long.The VERDICT:Coming 2 America had high expectations, an attempt to take a cult classic and try to pick it up so that the new age can be impressed again. It had elements that worked, with the music and dance taking so much of the character of the film to make winning moments that were often my favorite parts of the movie. Other sequences and scenes show that potential well, and the more serious, thought out moments really displaying what this movie could have been. Nostalgia moments do work sometimes to help amp up the factor, and bring with it comedy styles that made me laugh due to how natural they felt. Yet, the modern era gets in the way of this film, relying too much on forced humor, cramming too many stories into one movie, and disbalance between characters and stories that it has weakened this film. Bite sized plot lines trying to fight for the focus feel disjointed and lacking, the comedy styles too diverse and forced with the writing that it made me appreciate how natural it came in the first series. It goes to show that finding comedy to fit into the story instead of a story to fit into the comedy is important when it comes to making a movie great for me. As such, this movie is not awful, and it's good it's at home premier vs. theater. However, I stand by my comment that they should have left this franchise alone given the high stakes that would be hard to reach. My scores are:Comedy: 6.5

39,arungeorge13,Very little America in Coming 2 America! [+44%],4,12 March 2021,"It's not an enjoyable viewing experience if the bloopers turn out to be funnier than the 110-minute long film itself. Unfortunately, that's the case with Coming 2 America (a 33-year-late sequel) which has very little going in favour of it. To put it across rather bluntly, it lacks the plot inventiveness, gags, and even an in-form Eddie Murphy from the original. The story gets a serviceable 21st-century upgrade, but that's all the novelty there is. It's like the writers (Kenya Barris, Barry W. Blaustein, and David Sheffield) are only looking to tick certain boxes: fan service - check, feminism - partial check, repetitive gags - check. It brings back much of the cast from the original (minus their previously-untapped charm), which may be one of the few good things about it. Oh, and Leslie Jones gets some funny lines while Wesley Snipes' sideways dance is hilarious. Coming 2 America is a drab and predictable watch; one that most viewers will forget very soon.",Coming 2 America
40,Abdulxoxo,"Nowhere as good as the original, unfortunately",6,6 May 2021,"Celebrating his 30th anniversary with Lisa, Prince Akeem is visited by the military dictator, General Izzi, of neighbouring Nextdooria, who, due to the fact Akeem does not have a male heir, threatens to invade Zamunda after the passing of King Jaffe Joffer. When Akeem conveniently learns of a son back in Queen's, he travels back to America to find him with the intention of bringing him home and teaching him what he needs to know to one day rule Zamunda.The main function of a comedy is to be funny, right? To be honest this film didn't make me laugh as much as I'd hoped. There were a few giggles, but compared to the original this film does struggle to deliver the humour. One of the reasons for this is that they try too hard to reuse gags from the first film. I guess the thought process being if people found it funny the first time, they'll find it funny again. Doesn't work that way. And any of the riskier jokes in this either had a quick retort or were fully explained to make sure we as an audience were in no doubt that it was only a joke.And narratively this film is also way too similar to the original. Everything there is in the original is also in this sequel, which made me cringed at the lot of the scenes. It's like the whole thing or movie became self-aware/too conscious of itself, ""hey we are making a sequel to a classic comedy movie after 30 something years why don't we just put everything in the original in this and also get every black actor/celebrity there is on the planet to also act in the movie""However, while the similarities are apparent, that actually wasn't that much of a problem. I quite enjoyed the story. The beats may have been predictable, but the way it was filmed and performed was sufficient to exceed my low expectations. Performance-wise, I thought Murphy and the returning Arsenio Hall still had good chemistry. They brought back many of the original characters which was nice. The new characters are also a bit likable. Jermaine Flowler, who plays Akeen's son Lavelle Junson, was good but I'm not a fan of his character, the character totally lacks any kind of personality, he way too 'comedic' to be taken seriously. He pales in comparison with Murphy's Akeem in every way. His mum and uncle played by Leslie Jones and Tracy Morgan respectively were funny but only for a short amount of time. Akeem has three kick-ass daughters, the eldest, Meeka, was played brilliantly by KiKi Layne. Wesley Snipes, who clearly had the best time making this. Every time he enters a room and the way he walks was funny. Then when he spoke he was pretty funny too.Something else I didn't expect from this film was the amount of singing and dancing there was, not a fan of that, as I found most of them to be cringey but there were a few sequences; a couple of bigger ones at the beginning and end that were quite fun. We got a few decent musical cameos. There was also a well choreographed fight scene in here too.Aside from a slightly unconvincing CGI lion, visually, this film was nice to look at. The costume design I think was award-worthy. Same could be said for the hair & makeup. Even the production design was fantastic. The use of colours in this film was also good.Overall, Nowhere as good as the original, and like they said if it ain't broke, don't fix it, but nevertheless 'Coming 2 America' is a slightly enjoyable film if taken for what it is.",Coming 2 America
41,gianmarcoronconi,Not horrendous,5,20 July 2021,"Film not horrendous but with many flaws and very old as humor, it is fun sometimes but also bored enough. The plot is slow and seems almost unnatural. It is obviously not equal to the predecessor, but the problem is that it does not even approach.",Coming 2 America
42,baumer,Terrible sequel,1,5 March 2021,"Another reviewer in here mentioned that for everything that Cobra Kai gets right in the nostalgia department coming to America part 2 gets wrong. It seems like almost every character from the first makes an appearance in this one. But where they get it wrong is that very few of these characters really add anything to the movie. And someone forgot to tell them that coming to America was a comedy because coming to America part 2 is void of laughs. People sometimes hyperbolize when they are angry at a movie they thought they were going to like but in this case I can be honest with you and tell you I'm not exaggerating when I say I didn't laugh once in this film.One thing that brings this film down is Tracy Morgan. He brings down most films that he's in and here he adds nothing and he's annoying most of the time. The Leslie Jones character is flat-out horribly written as well. There's not one shred of honesty in anything that she says or does with the exception of her reaction to getting bathed by the royal bather.Where as the original had charm and humor and a lot of fun characters this one recycles the same old jokes except they don't work this time. Eddie Murphy maybe just isn't funny anymore. He'll always be a comic genius to me but maybe you just get complacent and lazy when you get older.The runtime was around an hour and 45 minutes and I think a half an hour of it was spent on dancing. It felt like every 15 or 20 minutes there was another 10 minute dance sequence. You do it once but three or four times just gets to be excessive.Unfortunately the characters that we do like from the original, like Lisa McDowell and her father, Louie Anderson and especially Semi are just given cursory glances and really don't have anything to do in the film. We needed more soul glow and more sexual chocolate and more humor. We might have even needed John Landis to bring his eye for detail to the film.Coming to America joins the ranks of other horrible sequels to beloved films. There is even a sequence in the film where two of the characters talk about the sad state of Hollywood and that all that really exists right now are superhero films remakes reimaginings and sequels to films that nobody asked for. They should have realized that instead of this being tongue-in-cheek it was actually 100% true.1/10",Coming 2 America
43,brchthethird,Completely dependent on nostalgia,6,5 March 2021,"Well... It is 2021 and a belated sequel to 'Coming to America' exists. And not one that I can imagine people clamoring for either. But returning to the well of nostalgia is almost a perennial activity, so not really surprising. Was it funny? Yes, in parts. Those parts happened to be callbacks to the first movie, though. It was enjoyable to see these people doing these characters again, like trying on outfits you haven't worn in years. The new additions were just that, although I can't really say that they really did much for the story, which was basically a rehash of the original. But the film acknowledges this in a meta/postmodern way, so it's ok? Kind of? I will say that I laughed and had a decent time, but this will be a one-and-done. I wouldn't have bothered to see it had it not been part of my Amazon Prime subscription.

47,kjproulx,Another Late Comedy Sequel that's too Much of the Same,4,10 March 2021,"Coming to America was never a movie that I grew up watching, nor ever seen until fairly recently. Something about it just never appealed to me, and that's coming from someone who will watch anything. With that said, I thoroughly enjoyed watching the original film when I finally sat down to watch it. The goofiness along with a great comedic performance by Eddie Murphy is what held the movie together and made it so likeable. Well, 33 years after the first film, a sequel was just released on Prime Video, and while I have to admit that I laughed a few times, it's a very poor film overall.Coming 2 America picks up in real-time with these characters, decades later. Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) is unimpressed that he has no son to be his heir once his newfound reign as King ends. Learning that he accidentally made a son of his very own while on his first trip to America, he ventures back to meet him and bring him home. This is also where today's lingo and humour are brought into the film tenfold, making for a very jarring experience in comparison with the first. I get it, the humour of the first film was very much of the time, as is this one, but it didn't click all that often for me. It felt more like pop culture references rather than legitimate jokes.Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall are both once again very enjoyable here, trying to keep up with the times, and I even enjoyed Lavelle Junson as Akeem's son Jermaine. The biggest problem this film faces, however, is the fact that it feels like a copy and paste of the original film. Aside from a few side characters/plots that kept it from feeling identical, I honestly felt like I was watching the first film again, through the lens of 2021. It was like a blend of old and new, which has worked for some late sequels, but it didn't click here for me. That's a shame because this film has some very relevant underlying messages that are very well-done. I just wish they were in a better film.I truly believe the reason that so many people seemed to be looking forward to this sequel was the fact that Eddie Murphy has recently been appearing in more projects again. He definitely hasn't lost his charm, but just like the cast of movies like Anchorman or Dumb and Dumber, sometimes it feels like these actors are just trying to replicate the past. As I said, it has worked before, but it seems pretty rare at this point. I laughed multiple times, but only because of a few unexpected line deliveries from certain performers. There were a few scenes where it felt a little improved, and those were easily the best moments.Overall, the story plays out exactly how you think it will after watching the first 10-20 minutes. If for nothing else, it's good for a few laughs that are spread throughout the movie, but I just didn't connect with the story this time. I'm not saying late sequels to popular movies need to stop, but I believe they deserve more. This movie felt lazy to me, which was a huge disappointment. Coming 2 America is now streaming on Prime Video. Certain viewers will probably have a blast, but I personally can't recommend it.",Coming 2 America

When I watched this, I didn't even realize that this is a sequel to the movie with the same title in 1988. That means it didn't matter if one haven't watch the first one before seeing this one.Viewing as a stand-alone comedy, I had a great time. The movie was over the top with exaggerated characters. For me, even though the jokes were simple, they worked well and I laughed many times throughout the runtime. As a comedy, that's all it takes to win me over. It might not be funny to some. I loved all the actors, especially Eddie Murphy, who played multiple characters in the movie.Even more, the movie looked very colorful and lively as there were many fun dance performances. The costumes were also great.As for the story, it was very predictable as I knew what was coming. Toward the end, it became cheesy, and dragged out too much. The theme of breaking the old conservative rules and embracing who you are were clear in the movie, but the cheesiness of the movie didn't make this theme feel all that important.Overall, despite the mediocre script, I still had a fun time with the movie, probably due to me being pretty easy with jokes. 7.5/10",Coming 2 America
49,DarthVoorhees,Another long awaited sequel helplessly trapped in the shadow of a classic,5,22 March 2021,'Coming 2 America' is exactly what it advertises it's self to be. Any pleasure one gets from it will be due to seeing Eddie and Arsenio step back into their old characters. It is a nostalgia trip that coasts on your love for the timeless original classic. It doesn't work beyond that although I have to give it a little bit of credit because it does try to subvert the original.Why are we returning after all this time? Because 'Coming to America' is a classic filled with memorable characters and Eddie Murphy at the height of his powers. It is a movie that begs to be rewatched and rewatched and it never loses any of its bite. 'Coming 2 America' borrows all the goodwill it can from the original and yes for one viewing it kind of works. I had a big grin visiting My-T Sharp and McDowell's again. In fact they are far more interesting than anything in the main plot. The easter eggs in this easter basket are enough to warrant one viewing.I will give 'Coming 2 America' credit. It tries something new. The movie is a reverse of the original plot and has Akeem's American son Lavelle travel to Zamunda to take the throne only to follow his heart and fall in love with Mirembe a Zamundan handmaiden. And so 'Coming 2 America' is a pass the torch sequel. That's a fine ambition for the movie to have but I'm sorry I don't think people waited thirty years for such a sequel. We wanted Eddie and Arsenio. It isn't to the fault of Jermaine Fowler and Nomzamo Mbatha who do have a nice screen chemistry. It's just we want Eddie.The conceit of traveling to Zamunda doesn't allow for the best comedy either. The original was funny because we took the grand African prince who lived in a fantasy world and contrasted him with the comparatively boring and dirty New York.It's really pointless to devote loathing to this. I knew it would never match the highs of one of my favorite comedy classics. For what it's worth for one viewing I did enjoy revisiting Zamunda and I certainly love that Shari Headley and John Amos are getting love. If I have a 'Coming to America' itch though I will always turn to the original.,Coming 2 America

51,MrDHWong,Retreads its predecessor so heavily that it has very little reason to exist outside of mere curiosity,5,11 March 2021,"""Coming 2 America"" is the sequel to the 1988 romantic comedy ""Coming to America"". Once again starring Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall, it retreads its predecessor so heavily that it has very little reason to exist outside of mere curiosity.Thirty years after his marriage to Lisa McDowell (Shari Headley), the newly ascended Zamundan King Akeem (Eddie Murphy) is shocked to discover that he has fathered an illegitimate son during his original visit to Queens, New York. Due to him only having daughters and no other male heirs to the throne, Akeem and his aide Semmi (Arsenio Hall) hastily travel back to America to look for this young man. Shortly after arriving in Queens, Akeem learns that his son is a streetsmart unemployed ticket scalper named Lavelle (Jermaine Fowler), whom after some convincing, is promptly flown back to Zamunda to undergo a set of difficult trials before he is fit to take his father's place as a successor.Back in the 1980s, very few comedic actors enjoyed a career as prosperous as Eddie Murphy. His hilarious wit coupled with his charming affability helped make films like ""Beverly Hills Cop"", ""Trading Places"", and of course ""Coming To America"" such big hits around the world. In this sequel to the latter of those films, that winning formula is sadly missing as the story feels lazily copied and pasted from the original to the point where I questioned the very reason why it was made at all. Although the concept of Akeem meeting his previously unknown son did have potential, it is played too safe for it to leave an impact in the way a proper continuation should. While its predecessor was far from a masterpiece, it was still a sweet-natured romantic comedy that utilised Murphy's talents to its advantage. This film, however, relegates him to an almost minor supporting role in favour of placing the focus on its younger cast members, letting his comic abilities go to waste in the background. That's not to say the film is devoid of any funny moments as I still recall chuckling at a few scenes, it's just that none of them really involve the two main characters of Akeem and Semmi. I understand this may be because they are older, but it still would have been nice to have had that humorous combination of the old and young cast bouncing off one another to balance things out.Taking over directorial duties from the controversial John Landis, Craig Brewer chooses to alternate between CGI effects and lavish sets when depicting the fictional African nation of Zamunda. The mansion belonging to rapper Rick Ross (who also has a small cameo in the film) was used for certain interior scenes of the palace, which appropriately looks lavish enough to be a house of royalty. I like that real on-location sets appear to have been used more frequently as opposed to green screening in a background in post production but on the other hand, the African animals seem to be badly rendered products of computer animation. This is especially noticeable in a scene where Akeem and Lavelle are talking outside and a large elephant crosses their path in a very unrealistic fashion. Parts like that stick out to me as lazy filmmaking and considering how much better technology has gotten in the thirty plus years since the original, there really is no excuse for this.As mentioned above, Eddie Murphy was not used as well as he should have been in the main role, instead somewhat demoted to a supporting character. This is a shame as I enjoyed Murphy in the first film showcasing Akeem's regal demeanour juxtaposed with the harsh urban setting of Queens, New York. Likewise, Arsenio Hall barely appears as Semmi, and when he does, he doesn't say or do anything particularly amusing outside of a quirky reaction face. However, I was pleased to see that both Murphy and Hall reprised their roles as the people in the barber shop, as they provided the funniest parts of both the original film and this one. As for the new members of the cast, Jermaine Fowler shines the most as Lavelle, a young New Yorker who is shocked to find he has royal blood flowing through his veins. Although his scenes with Murphy were limited, I did think they had enough chemistry for them to be believable as father and son.While not completely terrible, this three decade plus sequel to a popular Eddie Murphy film feels completely unnecessary. It only serves as a reminder that some movies should be left alone and aren't really worthy of being a multi-picture franchise. Reportedly, there is now a fourth Beverly Hills Cop movie in development that is set to release in the not-too-distant future so hopefully the filmmakers will have learnt their lesson by then. Personally, I doubt it.I rate it 5/10",Coming 2 America

I could not help but enjoy seeing the actors and their characters again, but that's not a movie. That's a reunion special. So we wound up with 2 different things happening: an updated version of the first film starring Jermaine Fowler and a bunch of cameos from the original. It is entertaining in fits and starts.

55,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (5 stars out of 10),5,7 March 2021,"The stage curtains open ...I am a big fan of the original film, so when I heard this sequel was being made with virtually the same cast, I was excited for it, but dreading it at the same time. The track record for making a sequel so long after the first film hasn't been too great lately with some less than stellar examples like Dumb & Dumber and Bill & Ted. This one comes 33 years after the fact.Prince Akeem and his wife, Lisa, are celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary when his father, King Jaffe, passes away. Now that Akeem is the King of Zamunda, the question of who will succeed him becomes of paramount importance - especially with pressure from the King of Nextdoria for his son to be wed to Akeem's oldest daughter. However, Semmi confides in Akeem that he actually has a son that he does not know about living in America. Akeem and Semmi go back to Queens to bring his son back to Zamunda, so that he can be groomed for the throne.Despite the 30 years of aging on everyone's faces (except for the barbershop quartet who miraculously survived all those years and look just the same), they managed to bring back the same level of energy and witticism they had in the first film. I'm not saying this one was as good, or even close to being as good, but it was light, colorful and fun. Having said that however, I would be lying if I didn't say this was a disappointment - and that's why I was dreading it.I wouldn't feel justified in recommending this one. It falls flat for most of the film with a few small laughs here and there. The best part of the whole film, was the final scene where Randy Watson and Sexual Chocolate rock the palace. Otherwise, I just wasn't taken with it. It really wasn't a bad movie, and the production value was high with some nice cameos along the way.

It's fun to watch and has great jokes. 33 years later, we finally get a sequel but sadly it disappoints.Coming 2 America takes us back to Zamunda where Akeem learns of his long-lost son living in America. He decides to go back to America, meet his son and build a relatioship with him.Coming 2 America is a disappointing sequel. It fails to capture the charm and humourous tone of the first one and what we get is a film that's essentially just a nostalgia trip. It's nice to revisit Zamunda and its characters after a long time. Seeing every actor from the first film reprise their roles was nostalgic but it didn't have the same feeling to it like the first one did. Despite being a comedy, this film is surprisingly boring. The story isn't anything and I wasn't able to get invested into what was going on. Majority of the jokes are very bland. I think I only chuckled once or twice but nothing made me laugh out loud. The script is the weakest aspect of the film. It's very predictable and not much about it was very exciting. What did catch my eye were the costumes. There was an interesting variety of styles and colours which I did like.The acting was fine. It's great to see Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall again as Akeem and Semmi but the film really underutilised their comedic abilities. There were so many funny moments involving them in the first film but there isn't much comedy involving them here. Jermaine Fowler, Leslie Jones and Tracy Morgan were fine as well. Wesley Snipes was fun to watch as General Izzi but there weren't any standout performances in my opinion.All in all, Coming 2 America is an underwhelming sequel. It may be nostalgic to people who grew up with the first film but I don't see a reason to go watch this sequel immediately.

It was going to have a theater release in August 2020, but the pandemic led to Paramount Pictures selling the worldwide rights to Amazon Studios. The original Coming to America had charm and originality, but sadly, this movie has neither. It sounds like Eddie Murphy has high hopes for this one because he has already declared that the next one in the franchise will be filmed when he is 75 years old. Arsenio Hall will be 80.THINGS I LIKED:
It was fun to see almost the entire cast of the original Coming to America movie come back to pay it homage with a sequel. Sadly, one missing is Madge Sinclair who previously played Queen Aoleon Joffer. She passed away from cancer in 1995. Samuel L. Jackson's character from the first movie was going to return with a cameo of his robbing McDowell's again, but Jackson was too busy filming another movie that he didn't have time. Eriq La Salle, who played Darryl in the original movie was also too busy directing Chicago P.D. Complete Series DVD Season 1-7 Box Set that he wasn't able to make a cameo performance.
Who doesn't love James Earl Jones? He and his voice are legendary. In real life, he recorded the ""This is CNN"" greeting for the station, so you might recognize his voiceover work in this movie when he identifies the Zamunda station by recording, ""This is ZNN."" There is also a comment about General Izzi claiming to be the ""inspiration for Mufasa"", which is the name of the lion James Earl Jones voiced in The Lion King.
Everyone loves Eddie Murphy. His daughter in real life plays his character's middle daughter, Omma. Did you notice that Akeem's oldest daughter's name is Meeka, which is Akeem spelled backward? If you're a true Eddie Murphy fan, you'll notice some Easter-egg moments from other movies like Dolemite, Trading Places, and Delirious.
Jermaine Fowler loved the first Coming to America so much that he recorded the barbershop scenes onto his family's answering machine so that callers could hear the old men's banter when they called on the phone!
Singing performances include cameo performances by Terry Ellis, Rhona Bennett, and Cindy Herron as En Vogue, Cheryl James and Pepa as Salt n Pepa, Gladys Knight, and John Legend.
The African costumes were fun and creative.
The movie was mostly filmed at the home of the hip hop star Rick Ross. His house is so huge that they just dressed it up a little to make it look like a palace. He owns a ton of acres too, so even the scenes of the African plains were filmed in his gigantic backyard! For the film, the design crew changed the wallpaper in Rick Ross' dining room and installed a 60-seat dining room table. Rick Ross loved them both so much that he was able to keep them as a thank-you gift. He also stars in the movie as Nexdorian Commander.
The movie premiered in several locations, including the Queens Drive-In in New York City, a location featured in the original movie and in this sequel. They gave away a swag bag to attendees of the premiere that included a container of Soul Glo.
There are quite a few references to Kenya through words and items in the movie.
Keep watching during the final credits to see some funny outtakes and bloopers and a musical clip from the amazing John Legend!THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The movie felt like such a big money grab that I was embarrassed for Eddie Murphy.
Some of the cameo performances felt like Eddie Murphy just owed people a favor or something. Eddie Murphy wanted Tracy Morgan in the movie, even though Arsenio Hall pointed out that he and Eddie were about the same age, so it wouldn't make sense.
Some of the characters will get on your nerves.
There is some poorly done CGI.
The story is so forced with a nonsensical ending.
I always write down funny lines and interesting lines when I watch movies so I can share them with you, but I didn't find anything worth noting. Sad, right?TIPS FOR PARENTS:
So much talk and joking around about sex
Some profanity
Scantily-clad women
Talk of intimate relations outside of marriage

63,drewnes,"""It is true about the sequels. If something is good...""",4,30 May 2021,"Coming to America is a national treasure and has a high score on the rewatchability scale. Coming 2 America is a film that while it has a few laughs, just does not come close to it's predecessor. The costume design was legit though, and the dancing/music was pretty good, I just am already forgetting most of the scenes as I type this out.",Coming 2 America
64,judywalker2,a missed opportunity,5,29 March 2021,"I watched this movie anticipating it to be just okay and it was, but it missed it's opportunity to be more than good. Her is the Eddie Murphy, the King, with lovely, capable daughters and he goes out to find his son by an American woman to take the throne. Also, why does his son have to take it, well because the king's father (nice to see James Earl Jones again) doesn't think he can handle it. Now in comes the villain, Wesley Snipes, in the stereotypical African General bad guy role. The story lacked imagination because they were too busy revisiting all of the comedic tropes they could find. Too bad.",Coming 2 America
65,jordan2240,They should have stayed in Africa,4,9 March 2021,"I can't even recall whether or not I saw the original, but it couldn't have been this bad or my wife wouldn't have been anxious to see the 2nd. Either way, we were both disappointed with this film. They tried to make a 'rom-com' that was overly heavy on 'rom', and the storyline was so trite, it was embarrassing to watch. I'm sure the cast had fun making the film, so at least they got something out of it. The only scene I found funny was the first one in the barbershop, so if you just fast-forward to that one, you'll likely get all the enjoyment this has to offer, and save yourself the time of suffering through the rest. I did enjoy looking at some of the women in the cast, so there was that as well.",Coming 2 America

69,PedroPires90,Disappointing,5,10 March 2021,"Disappointing. And it's not nostalgia, I've watched the first one just a day before and it was as good as ever. This one just a poor excuse, with a bad plot and some funny moments are just copies of the first movie (there is a difference between a homage and a copy).At least, the first half of it is genuinely good, the barbershop scenes were funny and Wesley Snipes is great on it. The new female characters are good (Kiki Layne as Meeka, Leslie Jones as Mary and Nomzamo Mbatha as Mirembe), but I don't think Jermaine Fowler did a good job (too extra, doing the same role we have seen countless of times before). Murphy and Arsenio were not as funny as before (and damn, he was funny on Dolemite is My Name, so it's not a new Eddie's problem, it was the script), but Shari Headley did a good job. I don't know if they thought if Fowler was enough to bring Murphy's original magic, but...nop.I liked the colours and the costumes (some good references to some African countries), even if the scenarios were too much artificial to me. Too many musical/dance numbers and you definitely feel the PG-13 rating, as it looks like a Disney movie.It worth a watch to remind you of some great characters, but it was more like a parody than a real movie.",Coming 2 America
70,ethanbresnett,Unpopular Opinion - I enjoyed this just as much as the first!,6,17 March 2021,"Despite not being one of Eddie's finer films, I enjoyed the first Coming to America film a perfectly reasonable amount. It made me laugh and had a great premise, so I was very much looking forward to the follow up. Thankfully I wasn't disappointed!Near enough every character from the original returned, and there were some great homages and throwbacks to the first film, all of which I enjoyed. One highlight was the addition of Wesley Snipes, whose character was a scene stealer.The story was pretty solid and enjoyable. It is essentially a flip of the first film. Whereas that explored Eddie Murphy's Zamundan prince trying to familiarise himself with American culture, this film explores a born and bred Queens boy trying to familiarise himself with Zamundan culture. As you'd expect the consequences of this lead to varying levels of hilarity, and its all pretty enjoyable and watchable stuff.What I enjoyed more about this film than the first was how it embraced African culture, with some great set design, costuming, and choreography.Sure this film isn't amazing, but it is fun. If you enjoyed the original film and if you like Eddie Murphy movies in general, then this should be right up your street.",Coming 2 America
71,theknownames,Flawless transition ( and that clean Murphy),9,17 March 2021,"This star studded circus of nostalgia seamlessly follows the first.
Coming to America came out in 1988 , the old school comedy just lightly translates to modern day and how can we forget just how clean Eddie Murphy had to become at this point in his career?Now days, I can appreciate the production and epic cast . Yes, epic, as well as nod to 80's storylines , remember rags to riches , magic makeovers, love triangles....
The cast appearances are full on Extra! Not only gathering the og's but in addition !
Musical guests abound. The musical guests!These days , there aren't a ton of movies like this
( for the whole family ) entertainment with all the extra trimmings
I wasn't expecting much (only to appreciate the follow up and to settle in to some at home entertainment) but it was actually even better than I expected and I enjoyed all the nuance too - like the poking fun of itself, for example - when the cgi isn't lined up.
If we can't appreciate these things, we will be too soon be out of luck.
Why would anyone want to cast and direct a sequel, they know it can't be better then the first but they do it for the fans, for a throw back to the good old days.
We also get a hit of "" where are they now ?"" With players like James Earl Jones ( who like the great David Attenborough) and also Morgan Freeman - the wonderful voices of our time , our wholesome , timeless , soulfully voiced narrators, how often and how do we get to see them in action ?
If you remember enjoying the first then this is right along the same lines, plus .
I bumped this to a 9 ( based solely on my rating a sequel if this movie just popped into theaters with no context then it would still deserve credit for the production and cast )",Coming 2 America

73,docm-32304,"Fell surprisingly short, but still some fun",5,6 March 2021,"Ironically the movie itself talks about the problem with sequels that nobody asked for...and they were right. The movie is definitely not as good as the first and many of the original actors did not age well. In fact some looked like this was a zombie apocalypse movie. I didn't think Snipes could be any worse that his long string of bad movies since 1998, but in this one, he is just plain embarrassing. Still, it is an okay entertainment, just don' expect the same magic as the first one.",Coming 2 America
74,TheAll-SeeingI,"Expertly Contemporary, Joyously Nostalgic",9,5 March 2021,"Thirty-three years after the arrival of its classic progenitor, ""Coming 2 America"" reintroduces the signature big-heartedness that empowered the first film to capture generational audiences from one to the next. This is a witty, tonally refreshing movie that employs deft humor to deliver uplift and progressively-realized truths in a day and age yearning for both in spades.""Coming 2 America"" lifts the great comedic pairing of Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall into rarefied air, as Murphy's exquisite King Akeem of Zamunda returns to America with straight man sidekick Semi (Hall) in search of Akeem's royal (male) heir: newly-discovered adult son Lavelle (Jermaine Fowler). The setup yields terrifically humorous opportunities to skewer our racial lunacies, and when they journey back to Zamunda -- joined by Lavelle's resplendent mother Mary (a show-stopping Leslie Jones) -- we find women who refuse to suffer prototypical male foolishness while intellectually operating a step above it all.Helmed by Craig Brewer (who directed a remarkable Murphy on ""Dolemite Is My Name""), ""Coming 2 America"" expertly leverages and resists nostalgia in equal measure, and proves smart, funny, and radiant in its energy and warmth.

77,stevenrotherforth,Raises a grin but not a laugh.,6,17 March 2021,"Coming 2 AmericaWith thirty three years been and gone since the original 'Coming to America', you have to ask the question. ""Did we really need or even want a sequel?""
Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall reprise their roles as visitors from Zamunda.
Akeem (Murphy) is now king and learns he has a son in America.
So back off to Queens they go to bring back the rightful heir to the throne.'Coming 2 America' tries very hard to recapture the magic that made the first film so great.
Sadly not achieving the goal.
By no means a bad film but I found myself with a constant grin on my face rather than doubled up with laughter.
'Coming 2 America' is like a visit from an old friend.
It was good to see the old characters and I did occasionally chuckle when they were on screen.
Murphy and Hall should receive some kind of accolade for the amount of hard work going into bringing their prosthetic characters to life.
Hours spent in the makeup chair is thankless and we the audience take the performances for granted.
That said this sequel comes across as a watered down imitation of the original film.
There isn't anything special or memorable about the movie.
Perhaps Wesley Snipes brings something fresh with his turn as warlord General Izzi.
Other than that I don't see audiences remembering this movie and it certainly won't become the cult classic that the original movie has.
The scenes with beloved characters such as the Barbershop gang and Randy Watson of Sexual Chocolate are kept on a Leash. This due to the films child friendly rating.
An R rating would have been more welcome and fitting to the movies storyline.In terms of audio and visual quality, 'Coming 2 America' looks splendid in HDR. Costumes, scenery and sunsets pop with vibrant colours.
Detail is razor sharp.
Available on Amazon Prime Video in both 4K HDR and 1080p, it is the HDR version that you should definitely watch.
Once again Amazon disappoints with no Object based audio available.
Only a standard Dolby Digital Plus mix is on offer.
It's a punchy mix which does the movies soundtrack justice.
Dolby Atmos sound would have been preferred.
Come on Amazon you need to take inspiration from both Disney Plus and Netflix. Even Sky are now offering lots of movies with Atmos sound.So to sum up. 'Coming 2 America' is indeed a sequel that we never asked for.
But for fans of the original, when we found out that it was coming it was a pleasant surprise.
It's a shame then that despite all the hard work going into bringing the film to screen, the final product is somewhat mediocre.",Coming 2 America

Anything.Oh my, this is easily a 1.The best parts of this embarrassing nonsense are the flashbacks to the beloved original ""Coming to America."" They even got the title wrong, our heroes are in America for about 15 minutes...long enough to recreate the classic barber shop scene twice, which wasn't very funny, but is one of the few highlights of this mess. What should have a been a nostalgic trip down memory lane is quickly squandered.During the first trip, the King finds his lost son and the unfunny giant, Leslie Jones, in 30 seconds (no DNA test) and that's it - back to Zamunda. They do find time to make fun of white privilege, but instead of making it funny, they played the social message straight. Hooray, I guess.In this mess, I literally lost count of how many scenes featured various people and dance troupes parading through a massive palace door...choregraphed dancing, drums, singing and lame jokes, all while a bored Eddie Murphy sits on the throne and wishing he was in a better movie. Cut from that to other horrible scenes of more dancing and a contemporary thumping R&B soundtrack that never eases up. They should have made it a musical.The Circumcision joke is desperation. It's the lowest of the low hanging fruit jokes. The next being the Tracy Morgan's Sizzler joke about all-day shrimp not being all-day because they stop serving at 6. What's next? Airline food jokes.At one point, the annoying son is explaining the ""bait and switch,"" ironically, it was a meta-joke about this horrible film...moments later, he outruns a cheap CGI lion. Nothing makes sense.King and the gang head back to NYC in the third act; a brief barber shop scene (no jokes) and the church preacher. They almost had a laugh with an Uber/Lyft joke, but couldn't even manage that...had to cut it short to show Wesley Snipes fighting with a bow staff (there's a lot of bow staff dancing and faux fighting in this).Eddie Murphy is a legend...why they made a movie where he isn't funny is bewildering.Horrible on all levels (except the blooper reel at the end).Cheers.",Coming 2 America

83,shanayneigh,Has nothing to do with the original,1,14 March 2021,"Apparently IMDb doesn't like reviews longer than ""dis sux!"" or ""zomg best ever!"". I had written a longer analysis of the movie, but it got deleted, so here's a shorter one.This movie is nothing but a lazy cash grab attempting to ride on a wave of nostalgia. Whereas the original movie was a smartly crafted comedy with a tight script and real characters, the sequel is nothing but a loud, obnoxious mess with a ridiculous story and cardboard cutout characters. The original was rated R, and the sequel is PG-13. The sequel has more to do with The Nutty Professor or any of the other lame family comedies Murphy started churning out in the late 1990's than the original Coming to America. It's a defanged Eddie Murphy with his hands tied behind his back. It doesn't help that loudmouth Leslie Jones is in this movie, playing the exact same character she did in Ghostbusters, shouting every single line.And then we get the musical numbers. This movie is more interested in shoehorning in washed up celebrities than telling a coherent story or crafting believable and relatable characters.And of course, since it's 2020 it must have lame girl power subplot, pandering to the Twitter patrol and making this movie essentially critic proof.",Coming 2 America

85,flicklover,Why Eddie? Why?,1,7 March 2021,"Coming to America is one of Eddie Murphy's most charming and funny films. The idea if going back to his character of Akeem and bring back most of the cast for a sequel sounds good right? But when I saw the trailer for this sequel I was not expecting much. Trailers, especially for sequels should make you excited to see them. This one didn't. And after enduring the hour and 45 minutes of this film I can see why the trailer was so bad. There was no good laughs to put in it!!!This is one of the worst sequels ever made. I know that it was released straight to streaming but I feel that Paramount must have had no confidence to release this in theaters. Yes I know that theaters are virtually empty because of COVID but if this were released under normal circumstances I think it would have failed at the box office. I get that sequels are mostly cash grabs these days and are almost always inferior to their originals but the dip in quality of this film compared to the first one is gigantic!!! It is not only unfunny, it is aggressively unfunny!!! I might have chuckled once or twice, but it was seriously unfunny. It obviously banks on yhe nostalgia that people have for the original and tries to hit the same beats but fails miserably. They bring back just about every actor from the first film here, but it feels like it's just they were brought back so people could acknowledge that they came back, nothing more!!! But worse is Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall. All of the chemistry they had in the first film isn't here!!! They are just not funny. What they do is supposed to be funny, but it just isn't. They both play multiple characters again, many of the same ones they did in the first one liked the old guys in the barber shop but the scenes just didn't work for me!!! I wanted to laugh but just didn't. Eddie Murphy's performance seems phoned in. He doesn't seem to even want to be there. He can be so funny and in the case of the first film charming. There is none of that here. The supposed story here is that Akeem, now King, finds out he has a son in America. Akeem goes back to Queens to meet and bring his son back to Zamunda so he could become heir to his thrown. Also there is a plot point about a militaristic dictator of a neighbor nation played by Wesley Snipes demanding one of Akeem's daughters marry his son. All of this is more or less done like the first film but without any laughs or charm. I just don't get why so many funny and talented people could be so unfunny. It doesn't help that this sequel comes 33 years after the original film. Nostalgia could only take you so far. Last year Bad Boys For Life did what this film couldn't recreate the feeling and chemistry between its leads and deliver alot of good laughs. Unfortunately, Coming 2 America failed miserably in doing that. The first film is a very funny and charming fantasy. This has none of what made the Coming To America enjoyable.The fact that almost everybody that was in the original is back and that didn't help says alot. Also, I think that the prior film being directed by John Landis helped. He was a very reliable director of comedies. The new director Craig Brewer doesn't seem to have the chops for this material. Bad script, lazy performances from your star equals disaster.I don't know why but Eddie Murphy sequels seem to just be bad!!! I think the only sequel to an Eddie Murphy hit that I've liked is Beverly Hills Cop 2!!!Very Bad sequel here, maybe the worst in his career!!!Grafe: F.",Coming 2 America

This one was OTT in a cheesy way, with trying to add as many celebrities as possible into it.All movies and shows nowadays have to include all this PC content and it's getting boring. I read that the director said, this movie was more toned down than the original as they wouldn't be able to get away with today what they got away with 30 years ago, especially the lyrics of that 'Queen to Be' song, and I get it...but hate having all this PC stuff thrown at us.
I understand the characters hadn't been to America for 30 years, and so they threw in all the pop culture and technology references which I found slightly annoying.I have say to though Wesley Snipes was funny in this. It was perfect casting, he really played that part well. I love how they got a majority of the old cast back, even the characters Eddie and Arsenio had played in the first movie. And I was so surprised to see the dog barking girl back, and the fact that she was still barking had me in stitches.So this movie had its moments. It was very funny in parts and fell flat in others. I'm not sure about the storyline...it works and it doesn't. Maybe the title should have been different because I expected them to spend more time in America, but it predominantly takes places in Zamunda.All in all, I enjoyed it, but I feel after a 30 year wait it could have been so much funnier. Maybe their decision to tone it down hurt the film.

90,Darkjak007,Mundane & disappointing,4,6 March 2021,"Coming 2 America takes place 30 years after the events of the first movie. it stars is Eddie Murphy, Arsenio hall,Wesley Snipes, Leslie Jones, Tracy Morgan, and a whole long list of other cast. Akeem is summoned by his father who tell him he needs to secure his lineage on the throne but has not conceived any sons to succeed him it is revealed that he has a illegitimate son in America after a one night stand that was only giving to justify this film. He travels to America to bring his son back to Zamunda and train him to become king. While it's nice to see old characters return from the first movie. The most funny scene being the return of the barbershop men. The new characters just barely have much to offer. Leslie Jones plays the mother to the son however she's not giving much to work here and just overall just comes off more a nuisance. the same could be really said to Tracy Morgan He doesn't offer much as much as a few head butting moments with Semmi. The one new character that Should've been given more screen time is Wesley snipes as the general who threatens to kill Akeem and usurp Zamunda. if Akeem doesn't marry one of his kids off to one of his.It's a goofy character little over the top, kind of similar to his character Simon Phoenix in demolition man only more warlord. Jermaine folwer as the son it's just not that interested you spent a bunch of time seeing him being trained to be the king and saying how he doesn't want to be the king. It feels like you're just wasting your time. There's a Older daughter who feels she should rule the kingdom, but can't just cause she's a woman and you get right off the back where the story is going to go from there on. Overall the jokes are what matter most in a comedy and really most of the jokes aren't that funny what is such in the barbershop & the circumcision scene . what was great about the first movie is they were more subtle and not in your face. This movie they're constantly in your face and being self-aware. There's a scene where they're talking about sequels and saying what's the point of them. A scene where the son says he doesn't need any handouts and then a huge stack of money and gold falls out of a case and then he's cool. jokes like that are predictable & not even trying. Another downside of his movies that you really don't see Zamuda at well you get a couple shots of landscapes that you know we're just green screened & the animals that are CG could've been substituted for trained real animals probably would've been cheaper than modeling CG animals in. This movie is what a lot of people probably expect it to be it doesn't have the quirky charm that the original has its characters aren't that likable it's jokes aren't as funny it just doesn't deliver on what many were hoping for after so long. when you have a movie sequel this long after the original you need to deliver. this movie just feels like I quickly put together of a sequel even though it has been 30 years.",Coming 2 America

The plot was on the level of Nickelodeon or After School special. There was almost zero humor, all the jokes were childish, flat, or over-the-top stupid. The editing was very chopped together as the movie jumped from scene to scene without any cohesiveness.

The barbershop scenes and the scene where Princess Lisa got drunk served as the only moments where the actors showed some of their old spark, but it's just not enough. No one had any presence. It felt like a parody of the original, ""Lion King"", and ""Black Panther"". Just skip it. It's really not worth it. It's just playing on blatant nostalgia with so many nods to the original that It's practically a remake, and a very bad one at that. It felt like the film was specifically designed around including as many nostalgic moments as possible, down to some of the same costumes but cheaply made this time. Just like the whole film.

This movie doesn't even swing for anything that could be construed as humour. The closest it comes is in casting Leslie Jones, as if to say, ""hey, she's a funny lady so her mere presence makes this a comedy, right?"" Wrong. The movie instead spends all of it's time on an inane princess and pauper plot line that strings together the worst Disney cliches. It did have a bunch of money put into it, which it wasted on grand opulent parties and dance sequences. Must have been a blast to shoot, but it's an absolute chore to watch.",Coming 2 America
97,TheVictoriousV,A background-noise comedy born of a strangely assault-like plot point,5,6 March 2021,"I didn't see John Landis' Coming to America until the sequel was just about to drop onto Prime Video, and I may disappoint long-time fans in that my reaction was lukewarm. I realize that it pioneered that sub-genre of comedy where Eddie Murphy plays multiple characters of multiple races and genders ('tis a shame he wasn't available for Cloud Atlas or Little Britain USA), and I suppose I'll give it this: it's easily in the Top 2 of films where James Earle Jones and Madge Sinclair play royal parents.After watching Coming 2 America, however, I can appreciate how much fun everyone appeared to be having in the original Landis film. In the sequel, Murphy and Arsenio Hall once again play several characters each, but don't seem quite as into it. There is some charm to it, of course, but other things will distract you here.For example, I don't know what it is with recent streaming releases and taking female-on-male sexual assault so very lightly. I thought films like this one and last year's Wonder Woman 1984 (wherein Diana Prince has sex with a man whose body is possessed by a dead Steve Trevor) weren't ever going to happen, or so I was assured by various third-wave feminists who promised that presenting inequality and mistreatment as uniquely female experiences won't set a really bad precedent for how these issues are treated.Here, non-consensual sex is a much more vital plot point than in Wonder Woman (which has about 8 storylines, anyhow), in that Prince Akeem (Murphy) is offered drugs by Leslie Jones in a sequence that ostensibly comes right after the nightclub scene in the first movie. All these years later, it is revealed that the Jones character had sex with him and that there exists a male heir to the throne of Zamunda somewhere in New York. Conveniently, the encounter was kept secret by Akeem's travel companion, servant, and supposed friend Semmi (Hall).It'd be hypocritical of a South Park fan like yours truly to take offense, per se, or assert that rape never belongs in comedy, but there is something unnervingly nonchalant about this plot point - though Semmi does get throttled and spat on. Also, the idea of digitally recreating a beloved scene just to abuse one of the main characters may be a part of the Hollywood trend that also gave us the gruesome murder of John Connor in Terminator: Dark Fate (set mere moments after the triumph in Judgment Day). Mainly, however, I find it weirdly thoughtless.Then again, much about this movie feels phoned in (excluding the costumes by Ruth E. Carter, who of course designed the sublime garbs of Wakanda in Black Panther). James Earle Jones, still playing King Jaffer, literally looks as if he's being filmed on his death bed as he explains that Akeem and Lisa (still played by Shari Headley) must find a male suitor for one of their daughters, since only a king may inherit the crown - I invite you to guess how subtly written the inevitable gender commentary is. They initially arrange for their eldest, Meeka (KiKi Layne), to marry the son of General Izzi (Wesley Snipes), ruler of the rival nation Nextdoria and brother to the woman Akeem refused to wed in the first film. You know what they say about the repetition of history.Of course, Akeem eventually learns of the true male heir (played by Jermaine Fowler) over in America, and so he and Semmi must return there to find him, all while running into different versions of Murphy and Hall, many of whom were in the original, on top of returning faves John Amos and Louie Anderson - the call-backs are cute enough to excuse the retcons. New additions to the cast include Tracy Morgan, Nomzamo Mbatha (playing a barber who, big surprise, might interest Akeem's son a lot more than his lovelessly arranged Nextdorian bride), Teyana Taylor, Morgan Freeman as Morgan Freeman, Rotimi, and various other celebrity cameos.As a harmless retread that you can put on as background noise while getting ready for something else, I suppose this isn't the worst. There are just some irksome implications to get past first and you may feel like you need to have a little chat with one of the writers.",Coming 2 America
98,alfiefamily,So disappointing!,5,7 March 2021,"Where was John Landis, the director of ""Coming to America""? Boy, did this film need him.I really was looking forward to this film. I loved ""Coming to America"" and I wanted this film to be good. I kept expecting it to get better and better, but it never did. Even the scenes in the Barbershop seemed forced. Not a good sign.Yes, the costumes & sets were terrific. Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall were a joy to watch, although I believe Hall's roll was much smaller than in the original.
Leslie Jones was very funny as the prince's mother. Wesley Snipes was quite funny.But the script and the CGI were a mess. An inconceivable story, too. And can we please not see Tracy Morgan in another film, please.

Second, why does Hollywood believe that by filling a film with black actors gives them a right to culturally appropriate and commercialize REAL African cultures? It was beautiful that the set designers or whomever it was decided to use derivative African artwork (i.e. the Benin bronzes) but having Eddie Murphy wear an Ethiopian cross around his neck the entire film (and the ""Zumundian"" crest/McDonald's with Amharic/Ethiopian script in gibberish) was crossing a line.

110,BigGuy,I wanted to like it...,4,12 March 2021,"You know how some movies have pictures/clips of each character with text saying where that character ended up after the movie? Coming 2 America seems like they took those snippets and wrote a movie around them.Coming 2 America also does not have the same feel as the original. The original, even though it was over the top at times, had a backbone of plausibility. The sequel has the backbone of a cartoon. Eddie Murphy's character has become a caricature, who vapidly is lead by the story, rather than leading the story. His son and especially the son's American family, seem to be written from stereotypes.Another way the feel is different for this movie, is it seems like it was written to be enjoyed by teens and pre-teens. It is almost childish, especially the villian of the movie played by Wesley Snipes. If Snidely Whiplash had backup dancers, he would have been more realistic than Snipes.The cameos are also excessive and distracting. They fall into two camps, the first are the real celebrities who play themselves, in tacky almost pathetic bits. The second is people who had bit parts from the original movie, which in many cases were unnecessary.Anyway, there are a few enjoyable moments, but it really feels like they tried too hard for nostalgia for the original, and also aimed for the children (or grandchildren) of the people who watched the original.The really sad thing is, there is even a bit in the movie where they talk about how bad sequels are....

113,arabnikita,Thin political narrative with plenty of cringe that is far from the original but the characters are there along with Zamundan silliness,6,11 March 2021,"After 33 years, it should come as no surprise that a sequel to an 80s comedy would be extremely watered down as it passes through countless filters of the 21st century. As a result, it doesn't live up to the level of the original; however, it does manage to retain some part of the spirit in terms of costumes, acting and overall silliness. It feels a lot like an Adam Sandler kind of film, which has a large cast of beloved characters doing stupid things in a plot that is as thin as a sheet of paper.It goes without saying, it is many levels below the level of the original and the whole ""Coming To America"" part takes about 15 minutes. The movie chooses to spend more time in Zamunda where a local warlord, Wesley Snipes, threatens to invade the country unless a marriage bond is formed with Zamunda. Nothing too complex but that's not what this film is meant to be and the way comedies go nowadays, it could have been a lot worse! We get our share of Eddie and Arsenio doing their usual shenanigans along with a bunch of new goofy characters who fit right into the overall silly atmosphere.Plenty of cringe (coming from the son), plenty of eye rolling (more than a few occasions) but at the same time quite a bit of humor that you might enjoy; personally, I had my share of laughs. They did their best in terms of creating the vibe but failed miserably in creating a good story. Whilie I felt ok about it, I can understand the hate. One lesson to be learnt here is that 80s and 90s comedies should be left alone because there is no way they can be matched in our day and age.

115,RogerBorg,"Such a great start, then such a desperately sad, petty, tedious, weak flounder",3,6 March 2021,"Millennials and Gen-Z likely won't know that the original Coming To America was an uplifting, unifying celebration of Black American culture. It featured the best Black American talent in a positive, confident way, without feeling the need to denigrate any other races or cultures. Black America rose without tearing anyone else down, and everybody of all creeds and colors loved it.And for the first 15 minutes of this sequel, I was celebrating along too. It starts as a funny, frothy, frivolous affair with stunning array of Black talent bringing us joy without judgement. I was weeping tears of nostalgic ecstasy.But then, oh then, we shift to the USA, and it all goes sadly 2021.Because what this movie needs you to understand is not that Black people are great, but that all White people are bad. White privilege is bad. White power is bad. White inheritance is bad. And that's what the movie devolves into, a super-woke, snivelling paean to Black Lives Matter.Such tasty bait, and such a bitter switch.Why is this so particularly awful? Because of the context. Because Zamunda (or Wakanda as we would pronounce it now) is an hereditary, patriarchal ethno-dictatorship in which the ruling classes own literal sex slaves.So, you riddle me this: what's worse? A company run by a White son that offers consensual employment to people of all races; or a kingdom run by a Black son that enslaves Black women into sexual servitude.Well, I know the answer to that, and it's not the one that the producers want me to think. But it's not a question that I wanted to address during a lighthearted comedy.If your idea of enjoyment is to scream ""Yaaas, kang, drag dat white bwoy!"" then this movie is for you. If not, then give it a miss, and don't sully your memory of those long lost decades when loving your skin color didn't mean hating on others.",Coming 2 America
116,MovieBuff11732,Another Sequel That Didn't Really Have To Be Made,6,7 March 2021,"Coming 2 America is about King Akeem (Eddie Murphy) learning that he has a long lost son (Jermaine Flower) in the land of Queens. He also has a rival (Wesley Snipes) who wants to marry into the family and become king. He goes to Queens to get his son and teaches him how to be a prince.Coming 2 America is just another try to bring back an 80s movies that didn't need a sequel. The first was a fun comedy that made you laugh. This film is rated PG-13 while the other is rated R. I don't think it really needed to be R because it still had some funny scenes but the thing that hurt from that was the harder shop dudes. They weren't as funny. Besides that, the movie did provide some good chuckles. The story wasn't that creative. They recycled the message from the first movie and it just felt lazy. The story wasn't the exact same but as I said, the message is the exact same. Prince Akeem's son does do the same sort of things Prince Akeem did in the first one even. The middle act also dragged on. The start of the film had so much heart and I thought it was going to be like that for the whole movie then, it just dropped all of that. There was little to no comedy in the middle act and the characters you wanted so see had nothing to do. The story overall wasn't really that good.The acting didn't save the film because there were many other bad things but it did do the film a solid. Eddie Murphy gave a pretty solid performance. It is on the same level as the one in the first film so nothing surprising there. The same can be said for Arsenio Hall. Leslie Jones, Wesley Snipes, Tracy Morgan, and Jermaine Fowler were all added to the cast and none of them did anything out of the ordinary. Overall, the acting was good enough to call the film all right.The CGI in the film was atrocious. There was an overuse of it on the animals and backgrounds and it just didn't make the movie look that good. They totally could have used real animals just like the first one did but they took the easy way out and used a computer. It just came across as lazy.Coming 2 America was a movie that didn't have to be made and it followed the trend of remade 80s movies in that they don't have any plot once so ever.

I don't know if it's a 4. It felt like a 1 or a 2, but I repeat. They didn't massacre the original and for that alone I'll say it's worthy of at least a 4. So here we are.

Too bad that this parody of a parody is tragic overall. Other than the running gags from original this movie has nothing to show for.
I am not sure if the cast is to be blamed. Jermaine Fowler as a pretty face kinda fits the bad script. Maybe the mother Leslie Jones could be played better by Arsenio Hall.
The original was carried by Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall, here they both play a second fiddle (in terms of scree time) and that probably tells everything about the movie.I had higher expectations from the creators of Dolemite Is My Name.",Coming 2 America

Watch it for nothing other than seeing some of your favorite actors/characters on screen together, some nostalgia, and some great costume design. I totally thought they'd pit a certain character against another one, but they didn't, which was nice, but that made the movie SUPER predictable about half-way in.
The movie otherwise has a weak plot, doesn't give you enough time to care about the characters you want to get behind/dislike the bad guy. That said, there were some good 1-1 conversations that were good, some chuckles here and there. The story in the first one revolved around going TO and being IN America, and hence the name. This one though, the title and the story don't feel as strongly connected. This was more ""Going to Zamunda"", IYKWIM.

Some funny parts.I like the storyline.Casting was great - both original & new members. (Notably, I like how they integrated the old cast members into the new storyline.)I liked the fashion choices.Other things to note:
Halfway through, I wanted the storyline to progress more quickly.There's *a lot* of influence from black panther (hair & fashion choices, style of fighting, music). There are also some segments that feel like a musical.

Wesley Snipes seems to be the only one having a good time. Everyone else looked awkward. Speaking of Snipes, he plays a general who's supposed to be the big bad, yet he and his armed military are no match for a trio of teen girls with sticks. Make that make sense. Reverend Brown is labeled ""sexist"" repeatedly. Apparently finding the female form attractive in 1988 is sexist in 2021.

There was a brief fight scene, though the martial arts training itself was a better watch. In short, it's fun!Problem with sequels in general is creating an original story while remaining true to the previous film. I don't mind a flashback or two, but there was a bit too much re-hashing, including the plot itself (like The Force Awakens compared to A New Hope). Additionally, there's not a lot of re-watchability once you know how things turn out. By the end, everything wrapped up quickly, neatly, and with little resistance. Being that family was a big part of the theme, I think the movie could've been cleaned up a bit for a more family friendly PG movie, which would hold a younger audience appeal as well.",Coming 2 America

I give it above 5 because I liked the music, the performances, the costumes and the fact that the original cast got together for this. And for some nice jokes here and there. But...why didn't they try a bit more? With the likes of Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall you can get a great comedy. However, these guys didn't seem to enjoy much being there. The pace is slow and the energy is low in about 80% of the film. Tracy Morgan is not adding anything new and Leslie Jones... was more annoying than funny.

It's always a risk seeing a sequel to one of your favourite comedies or films, so perhaps it's my own fault.In my opinion the film lacks the charm and especially the humour of the first movie. This tale just ain't funny and the story is so messy that you don't know where it wants to go. Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall hardly have scenes together and you can even say that Murphy isn't ""the hero"" of this tale. This story is about his illegitimate son Lavelle (Jermaine Fowler) and Murphy must help him prepare for the throne of Zumunda. Only the scenes and shots that refer to events of part 1 made me smirk a little. Okay, and some cameos are funny. If you know part 1 very well the cameo during the endcredits is pretty hilarious. But Lavelle's mother, played by Leslie Jones, is actually very annoying.I wonder what would have happened if there was no Covid and this film had a normal release in the cinema.

I was genuinely interested in the first 20 minutes and then it just rolled so much downhill after that. The movie just felt like it was written so BACKWARDS. Why are the characters so thin and flat the writing is very awful. The only highlights of this movie is whenever it references the original, and when it brings back familiar faces... once the movie actually tries to be what it's supposed to do... be an original story, it just fails... here's some examples...
Why the hell does the prince complain about not having a dad early In the movie and then when his dad shows up he's all happy go lucky to go to his country because he's rich?? Still think it's okay? Okay fair enough... but how come when he's there he's faced with challenges to take the throne and he complains about it but does it anyways and then when he completes and is ready to be kong he decides to run back to the slums???I thought the WHOLE point of akeem was to be accepted regardless of his riches... the movie would have been SOOO MUCH more interesting if he would have just stayed in New York and seeked his son undercover with his wife... all the story elements and characters would have meant more at least...This isn't even a fraction of what's wrong with this movie.

After 30 years of no one waiting for this, we finally got our sequel to Coming to America with Coming 2 America. Oh, so clever there. Long awaited and overdue but also, maybe, too late as well. Either way, Coming 2 America follows our favorite heir of Zamunda, Prince Akeem, as he secures his family legacy after learning he has a long-lost son in the United States. He returns to Queens to meet this unexpected heir and bring him back to Zamunda to build a relationship with him. Of course, if everything were that easy, there wouldn't be a movie but the rest we will leave up to you to detail the story. Let's see what we got.Let's be honest, they pulled out all the stops with this movie. All of black acting and comedy royalty appear in this movie. The costumes and sets were all over the top and amazing. Rick Ross' house and Tyler Perry Studios definitely have everything you need for a regal movie set. The biggest qualm I know people are going to have is that this doesn't feel anything like the original. Yes, they take us down memory lane throughout the movie, but it hasn't brought back the feeling from 1988. We all know societal norms and acceptances and culture have changed since then. Nevertheless, after 30 years, it's impossible to recapture that comedic magic without being corny or overly campy. In fact, if I'm being honest, this movie is like 20 to 25 years too late. You can even hear how late it is in Eddie Murphy's accent, or lack there of. I'm going to tell you all now, ""Get over it!""Where this movie succeeds is that the cast is full of life. The themes of the film are nice and cute for the family. Just like Eddie's career as a whole, he's moved on to making films his kids can watch and be proud of, and there's nothing wrong with that. Coming 2 America has jokes that call back to the past, connections to comics and artists of the present but also ideals that people really shouldn't be fighting so hard to hold on to. The movie comes full circle but part of the issue is that we've been around and around this circle so many times. They waited 30 years to give us essentially the same movie and then just added in a storyline that has been beat to death over the last 5-10 years. This is where I think the filmmakers really missed. You don't call on an iconic film to make it ordinary but that's what we got. The thought of this movie feels rushed but we also come against the fact that the movie feels too long.Coming 2 America is a movie that any family with teens and young adults can sit down and enjoy. The movie is in no way in the same ballpark as the original, but that shouldn't take away from the enjoyment you can get from it. I'd wish for more originality from this flick but I'll settle for endless cameos, nostalgic laughs and the cheap price of the movie. The actual movie is just a handful of popcorn but for the culture grab yourself a bowl and enjoy the call to the past.",Coming 2 America
173,toddg-473-289818,Political messaging ruined an otherwise somewhat funny movie,1,14 March 2021,"Coming 2 America did a few things correctly, being a sequel to a very funny and very successful movie a generation ago, in 1988. The nods to the previous movie with flashbacks, music, and the secondary characters created by Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall were all very entertaining. And the brightest spot was Wesley Snipes as General Izzi, trying to marry off his daughter to Murphy's son as a way to prevent war between neighboring nations. Snipes' comedic timing and talents were unbridled and on full display, in contrast to the many serious dramatic and action roles he has played for decades.In the sequel, Eddie Murphy rises from prince to king of Zamunda, and comes back to Queens to seek out a son he didn't know he had, as the laws of Zamunda only allow a male heir to eventually take the throne. After finding his son, he brings him and his family from Queens to Zamunda to prepare for an arranged marriage. The clash of cultures has some funny moments, and Murphy as king must now decide whether to allow his son to marry the woman he chooses, or the woman arranged for him. The makers of this movie should have stopped there.Instead we got a steady stream of lecturing on how men are sexist and misogynistic, weaved into each of the plot turns. Every few minutes. Nonstop. OK, we get it. It completely sucked the fun out of the movie. But this is 2021, and if you are going to release a movie in 2021, you WILL bow down to the woke gods of political correctness.

Great cameos. and great new stars not in the original. Fast paced or at least doesn't drone on one scene too long. If i remember correctly the original was a little more risque but did not miss or really even notice the difference (I also haven't seen the original in 20 years and probably forgot most of it anyway) Arsenio Hall is the funniest character of the film. Definitely works as a stand alone movie and as a sequel too. Fun part is they have a few flashbacks that show the original cast in various original movie scenes (Hilarious to see how they've matured) My only gripe would be for one of the main characters. I have absolutely no clue who he is. Don't remember his face from anything and someone similar to Tracy Morgan (but younger) should have been considered. They also ""borrowed"" a major theme from the original movie to prove a point in this movie, which is really lazy. However, all in all A very entertaining movie and glad I watched it. Alll that being said, you know they did R Rated takes. THEY MUST RE-EDIT AND PUT THAT VERSION OUT. I know I said I didn't remember the original film.

Why Ruin It?,3,6 March 2021,"The best part about Coming 2 America, the long-awaited sequel to the classic '80s hit Coming to America (that no one asked for), is seeing most of the cast come back together 30+ years later. It's hard to believe that James Earl Jones (who's 90 by the way), Arsenio Hall, John Amos, Louie Anderson, Paul Bates, Shari Headley, and of course, Eddie Murphy, are all still alive; looking good; and here for the sequel after so long! The only prominent cast member missing from the original is Madge Sinclair as Queen Aoleon. Rest in Paradise. Of course, we had some new faces this time around like Morgan Freeman, Tracey Morgan, Wesley Snipes, and Leslie Jones to make Coming 2 America and even larger star-studded affair than the original.Only, despite the additional firepower added to the cast, Coming 2 America never felt like a spectacular affair. For one, much of the added cast gave performances that felt like little more than cameo appearances. Even Snipes' General Izzi character, the antagonist, felt like an afterthought. Much of the blame can be put on the elementary screenplay and the lethargic directing of Craig Brewer. I know the main genre here is comedy, but why does this feel more like a parody of Coming to America than a genuine, respectable comedy of its own?Then there's Jermaine Fowler who plays Lavelle Junson, Akeem's illegitimate son from America for which the movie centers around. Let me tell you, he is simply not a strong enough lead to carry a film. And that's being nice. Fowler has no screen presence, no charisma, no charm, and really, no ability to act. Where did they find him?Anyway, while they tried to tell the story from a different perspective this time, with most of the plot taking place in Zamunda, it just felt like we have seen it all before. Yes, we have, in Coming to America, where it was done much better. Not to mention, many of the scenes in Coming 2 America appear to play off the success of Black Panther too much, especially the parts where Akeem's daughters do the African female warrior routine. Oh, and maybe it's just me, but shouldn't the film have been called ""Coming to Zamunda?""A little past midway through Coming 2 America, Prince Lavelle has a lighthearted discussion with his female barber and eventual love interest, Mirembe, where the subject of American cinema comes up. The two casually complain about Hollywood's obsession with making bad sequels to hit movies from the past that nobody asked for--and the dialogue goes ""If something is good, why ruin it?""

Wish that Allison Dean (playing Patrice McDowell) would have joined the return.Sadly most fans wanted more of the return to America focus. Sadly, they should recognize this is about the Prince becoming the King and the focus needed to be on the kingdom.Wasn't as funny as original but our taste for comedy has evolved so trying to amuse the average fan now requires a distinctly different style. Leslie Jones & Tracey Morgan definitely brought a different flavor to this and looks like many may not have appreciated their contributions.Definitely think it was watchable and pleasurable from comforts of home!",Coming 2 America

It looked like the cast might be having a good time but the jokes/comedy were lost never to be found big period. It was way to predictable as to what the different actors/comedians would do or say and it lived up to that. Loud, obnoxious, to much hidden canned laughter. Just lost everything to the viewer.I expected the story line by the first movie and it delivered but, the characters were stiff because you knew their shtick in stand up and that's what you got, stand up comedy without the comedy. The special affects were downright silly, tigers or was it a lion eating cat food. I did like the costumes and the dancing. The best part was at the end when everyone was in party form with celebration of just that, family. Who knew?

Couldn't hit on the magic of the original which as a fan of the original leaves me rather disappointed.You've got plot issues which detract from the story, the plot is kinda boring and drags along. King Jaffe Joffer changed the rules in Zamunda as king to have a princess not from arranged marriage but sticks to a tried male heir to what would be Akeem's term which could very well last decades and presumable he could change it anyway, so at most it's a deathbed wish Akeem really never had to follow through with and furthermore Lisa didn't like. In the first though Jaffe eventually caved in to changing this so why wouldn't Akeem?At least they kept Jaffe's over enthusiasm for some silly traditional stuff and other stupidity such as having his funeral before he actually died. Still it would have been just as fine to leave him alive to add a few lines, I mean what difference would it have made?So you've got a forgotten male heir in Queens? No big deal there really. Could have been explained off better than the path they took.Everyone aged except the My T Sharp crew which is kinda odd, but of course it's a fictional comedy.McDowell's in Zamunda? Not absurdly far fetched.Too much unfunny because it's stretched out time is wasted on Lavelle figuring out his place.I'm not really a Leslie Jones fan. Arsenio really didn't have a big role. No Soul Glo except some posters.They'd have been much better off just having Akeem, Semmi and Lisa fly back to the US. From there they should have had Lavelle working at McDowell's managed by Maurice, maybe not too well cause Cleo is over in Zamunda. They could have had Darryl try and win Lisa back or having married her sister. Could have thus had much less filler and time killing and made a more enjoyable movie.Even with the whole thing set in Zamunda there were so many better ways it could have been done.Ah well it's done and over with but such as waste or a rare opportunity with the cast.

Ok Action!"").No creativity (""oh wait, we can send a girl-power message this time - yea, let's add that!""), nor much effort in developing comic moments.I cannot find one scene that works here - it is an embarrassment and I literally cringed watching several scenes.I'm being generous in rating this 2-Stars, and justify such for the costumes and make-up which were the only things that exhibited effort and quality.The absence of Director John Landis in this sequel clearly made the biggest difference between this disaster and the original that did EVERYTHING better than #2.'Coming 2 America' sets the baseline for 2021's worst film.

Instead, we spend the core of the movie in Zamunda with a new character. To be fair, the new characters are not bad... they are good actors with heart and have some comedic moments. However, the city guy in an African country jokes wear quickly and when they finally return to NY in order to conclude the film, it's too late.

Before the old king's death he instructs Eddie Murphy's character that his daughter can not become Queen and it just so happens that the old medicine man has had a vision of a son in America. A bit of back story to fill in how he didn't know it could even be possible that the Prince had a son and the 2 leads are back in America looking for the now 31 year old son of the now king of Zumunda. Having found his son almost immediately off the back of the visionary's sketch the story continues. It's only during the last quarter of the film that the misogynistic set up at the beginning of the film starts to pay off with the women kicking some butt and laws of Zumunda being changed so the princess was to be the hair to the throne after all.Corny but not as bad as it starts off.",Coming 2 America

The novelty in seeing actors you haven't seen since the 1st which was pretty good just simply wears thin afternoons couple of scenes. Most of the actors have aged reasonably well except the star himself. Eddie looks horrendous. He is so awfully out of shape and really difficult to watch. On top of it there aren't any real jokes. Murphy see,s to have lost his magic touch. To be fair catches up with us all but calling this a viable sequel is simply a bold faced lie.

I do not have any fond memories associated with it yet, it did take me years back to my childhood and made remember the magic of watching a good movie.
This sequel, much like the spin offs and sequels that Hollywood make nowadays lack the magic.
There is no real reason for Akim to visit America again. He could've done the work via his servants/guards especially when the entire Queens plot is jus 5mins long.
There is no wonder in seeing Zamunda again, everything is the same as it was 30years ago with lesser lusture. The characters have no real motivation or a vision.
They just retried the first movie again for his next generation. Except for Wesley Snipes and Eddy Murphy, all characters were plain flat. They just were on screen. It was pleasant to see the characters from first movie including Eddy return but sad to see that they have aged considerably, and poor energy reminding us of our age too.
The makers forgot the original was not just a comic film, but a fun filled feel good film. This lacks fun, feel good story or even anything visually appealing.

If you loved the original, you will be disappointed with this one.THE GOOD - The original casts for the main characters from the original movie are back. And by the looks of things, relatively speaking they pretty much still looked the same. But that's where the ""good"" ended.THE BAD - the storyline stinks, and the plot utterly predictable from the moment the movie got started. By 1/4 through the movie, I had predicted who's going to be with whom and what will happen at the end. Sadly, I guessed it all correctly. There were no new surprises and no new gags, they simply recycled the same gags from the original - very disappointing. I know the movie is a comedy, but they had turned the dial way too much - it become comical instead. With unrealistic and over the top characters. The people of Wakanda looked more realistic.VERDICT: If a fan of the original, you will be able to tolerate watching this. But you won't see anything that haven't been shown in the original. Non-fans, you've been warned.TIP: This sequel has a lot of ""Easter Eggs"" from the original movie. Discovering them is probably the most entertaining part of the sequel. :)",Coming 2 America

Clearly there are huge differences in what some audiences like to see. For example Madea. I wanted to like those films but they're truly horrible and not funny at all to me but Tyler Perry has made a fortune off them because black audiences love them. Maybe that's what's going on here.

The original is an 80s classic, but this poorly conceived sequel only offers the occasional smile when it is trading off moments from the original. It has an amazing cast, but even their enthusiasm and effort can't raise this shocking material.The jokes just aren't funny, often relying on crudeness over actual humour. At best, they usually just fall flat. Leslie Jones and Jermaine Fowler are just annoying, although I'm not sure how much of this is down to the script and characters, than the actors themselves. Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall both feel like they're putting on a brave face, and giving far better performances than the script deserves, despite feeling a little awkward. Wesley Snipes gets away with his small part by just hamming it up and having fun, meanwhile James Earl Jones wisely gets himself out of the picture early on, after one of the few amusing scenes that also manages to be touching. John Amos is good as always, but luckily gets away with a couple of small cameos.One of the few positives, is that the costume dept. clearly had a fantastic time. Beyond that, this is simply a lacklustre couple of hours that should have either been completely reworked or left at the concept stage as a bad idea.

The opening of the movie was nice trying to portray Africa as a beautiful place and the royalty of Africa was nice, however this movie had a lot of issues. This movie really was trying hard to keep up with the millennial era and that is what the downfall was. This movie was busy trying to connect with ""young people"" instead of being the simple, old school movie it should have been. This movie felt rushed as well, the dynamic with the Akeem and his son was made practically overnight. The Queen and the other mother managed to get along quickly. The accents in this movie was trash. Also, this movie has proven that it is possible to have too many celebrities' in a movie. Next, that Baba character immediately needed to be deleted, I could not tell the gender nor the species of the character and thought Baba was Smeagle with locs. Teyana Taylor was sexy as she always is. Eddie Murphy was doing well with acting as multiple characters as he always does. Hopefully he doesn't get in trouble with the white face character he has in the barber shop. His son learned a new strategy against a lion awfully quick for being raised in America somehow with cat food. This movie should have just stayed a one time movie. Thanks for trying though so much.",Coming 2 America
246,AGood,Leslie Jones Ruined the movie,4,7 March 2021,"Leslie Jones is not funny. She spends every role shouting and screaming her lines and just acting obnoxious and somehow this is classed as humour. It is not, she is irritating.The premise of the movie is Leslie Jones character was supposed to have drugged and had sex with Akeem the first time around in the 80s and they had a baby he was totally unaware of. So in this me2 climate this is deemed a laughing matter to base an entire movie upon when its a women doing it to a man I guess.Overall this was an awful movie. It was unfunny and tiresome. I will say however I loved Nomzamo Mbatha as the royal Barber. She stole the film and made it a 4 as opposed to a 1. And John Amos is brilliant as Cleo McDowall as is Shari Headley's Lisa McDowell. They were the only sparks in a tired by the numbers movie. Everyone else, especially Arsenio Hall, looked tired and lacking any energy.",Coming 2 America
247,annlevtex,A Cheerful Wreck,4,14 March 2021,"Yes, this is a bad movie. Sloppy, poorly paced, frenetic, and silly. It's like (almost) every actor is doing his or her own schtick; no one is playing off of each other, and they sometimes seem to be ad-libbing. The music and dance scenes are random and over the top, they don't flow at all. It's basically a two hour series of set pieces and sketches, almost akin to one long blooper reel.BUT it's still pretty entertaining? The barber shop scenes are just as funny as they were in the first movie. Wesley Snipes as a preening general with a memorable walk is kind of a hoot. Leslie Jones and Tracey Morgan do what they were hired to do. I like both of them, so it worked for me. The Royal Bathers are back. The dancers can really dance, the costumes are decent, and there are elephants and lions, always a good thing in my book.As for the acting, for the most part the script fails the cast. They all do their best with it, with the exception of the actress playing Lisa, who is kind of stiff and not as likable as she was in the original. The daughters are adorable. The young actor who plays Murphy's son is very winning and gives the most sincere performance in the film. That's not saying much, given how much the cast is hamming it up, but it helps that the protagonist is someone you can like and root for.The movie pokes a lot of fun at itself, as it should. A lot of reviews are holding it up to the first movie and finding it woefully wanting. It's definitely not as good as the first one, but I think people are overrating the first one. Coming To America isn't exactly a great comic film. It's fun but it doesn't hold a candle to, say, Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop or 48 Hours. So I didn't have huge expectations.Anyway, as I said, it's a pretty poor product but there are enough funny moments to make it worth watching if you're in the mood for something light, or maybe to watch while you're cooking or checking your e-mails.",Coming 2 America

The idea of him getting baked and banging a random chick flies in the face of everything the first film presented. Akeem lost everything he was in the first film and was basically his dad from the first film.

But the ""sequel curse"" continues - most sequels are far less compelling.This movie seems like a ""money grab"" - a lot of people watched the original - and will watch this one.
Let's begin with the positive: it seems like a great reunion of actors and of ideas. And some new characters like the one Wesley Snipes are playing are outstanding.
It is funny, not because it is original, but because it reminds us on the old glory days.
Unfortunately it is also like a reunion: most dreams after 30 years are busted - some stars of the 90's now are just shadows of themselves - and we all understand, that the old jokes are... well old and no more that funny. Because we have changed and the world has changed.I am afraid that Hollywood (and the movie industry) doesn't change either - not before most of the institutions of the business broke down, and new ones are built.
The problem is, that these movies still make enough money to justify to make them.

262,TruthSeeker4Life,They are so GREEDY they decided to pay for cheap CGI and pocket the money,1,11 March 2021,"It was so obvious to me that they decided to use horrible CGI to pocket the money on this movie instead of spending it so the finished product is great like the first movie. This is the problem with these has been stars like Nicholas Cage who are so desperate to make a few more bucks because they are running low like Eddie Murphy and the rest of the old timers so they see these films as a one time chance to make a big pay day again because they know their caerers are over with. Had they actually believed in what they were doing they would have demanded better CGI, or not done it at all, but they wanted a BIG movie and a BIG pay day, but realized they had to have one or the other, so they took the pay day by paying themselves out of the films buget and settled with horrible quality CGI, directing, screen writers, etc etc! The movie was so lazy, stupid, and of poor quality, which goes to show that Eddie Murphy was a success because he surrounded himself with the right people back in the 80s and 90s! Making a comedy film is far different than making a comedy movie which is why all great comedians don't become succesful movie stars because they need great producers. directors, screen writers, like Eddie did. Eddie should just stop! His career is over with! Just like Nicholas Cage who is making a ton of horrible B movies just to make payments on all his debts! This was nothing more than a pay day for Eddie and the rest of the old timers and the quality of the film just proves it!Also, it would have been smart for the cast not to make this film about race when they were being interviewed by the media because here in the USA, their main market, is 70% white, so great way to single out your biggest customer base! Low IQ all the way guys!",Coming 2 America
263,Shaun_of_the_Dude,Coming 2 America will forever be one of Covid's miracles.,5,5 March 2021,"Considering that this film's post production and launch coincided with COVID 19, it's surprising it got released at all. Kudos to Paramount for completing it and selling it to Amazon.I'm 30 minutes into this film as it has just been released and I've been happy all day knowing it was to be released. However, not only is this a nostalgia fest from the off (which has both good and bad emotional effects on the viewer), but it also heavily relies on a lot of CGI and you can tell that a lot of the scenes were filmed very, very, very socially distanced and simply cut into the edit. This zaps all of the enjoyment out of the room as what comedy relies on is people in the room.I get the whole Covid socially distancing thing, and agree - but this was filmed before Covid and whilst you can forgive James Early Jones for doing his parts remotely (as most of the cast too to a degree), there are some scenes where the comic timing is off and you can see it is down to differential directing.Unfortunately, this film adds to a long succession of films which prey upon your nostalgia without really whetting its appetite. From a personal perspective, it's good to see Eddie Murphy and the cast again - but Paramount were right to flog this to Amazon; I'd probably have never paid my hard earned cash to see this and wait for it to hit TV (which is has - it Amazon Prime the 'New' Direct-to-Video?).Okay, so after the full viewing I'm quite happy with my original rating. It is nowhere near as bad as some of these reviewers are making out. Not by a country mile. But what it is is a pastiche of everything that made the original what it was. Everyone is in there and everyone plays their part - it's deftly cringe at times, and quite amusing in others. It isn't as funny as the original, but what are you gonna do?However - In Retcon City, the walls are wide and diverse and a lot of this feels like rewriting ones memoirs.5/10 - Eddie and co all look good for their respective ages - with respect.-1 - Whoever told Paramount that 'Arnieing' Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall was a good idea?",Coming 2 America

I watched the first movie as a kid, im now 33 so am old enough to remember the references and young enough to understand the celebrity cameos; so I personally enjoyed this.

In the one meta moment of the movie the film itself tells you this, and that it is unnecessary.
This is a tired, predictable, bland attempt to follow up a classic comedy. One that doesn't realize any sort of vision of originality and also doesn't realize that loud and outlandish on their own is not funny.
All the call backs to the original ""Coming to America,"" even the literal callbacks, ""Avengers: Endgame""-like scene replays of the original film, could not make this film interesting. To me they even pushed this one further away from the honesty and freshness of the original instead of tying it closer to it.
I hate writing this because I really wanted to like this movie. The returning aide characters were, again great, particularly Sexual Chocolate, and I really enjoyed how an early scene reminded us that ""Coming to America"" exists in the same universe ""Trading Places,"" but the rest was a mess.

272,Trupiaar,"Political Rage has Jumped the Shark, I'm done",10,6 March 2021,"I loved this movie last night. I think Eddie Murphy and cast did a lot of subtle things that went right over a lot of heads that are full of rage.Some reviews called this 'woke' or political. As a Trump voter, gonna address that first: calling it woke in any way is ridiculous. The plot with the the King changing the law so his daughter can take the throne is a very natural progression from the first movie, the king changed the law to be more progressive and allowed his son to marry who he wanted. Nothing out of line there.Now I think there were some political elements for sure, but you dummies missed them, sorry. First, let's talk about what's present and what's absent.Barber shop scene is crucial. King Akeem says something about congratulating them on a black president (in a very blackcentric movie), *but that's it.* No praises, no political messaging, nothing. Then, zero Trump bashing. This is the safe respectable play and I'll take it over Trump bashing any day of the week. Then the old barbershop been go on a rant about a bunch of progressive issues (Because they are old men) including transgenderism, and finish it with comic gold about how there are ""Nazis everywhere now."" They Benton geek squad Nazis. If you didn't notice, these old guys aren't scared of Nazis, they are just commenting on how ridiculous it is that ""anyone can be a Nazi"" (because everyone isn't Nazis , that's a dump political point).The values contrast with Zamunda and Nextdoria couldn't be more obvious. Zamunda was clearly the more conservative country for the geniuses that missed it while Nextdoria was gyrating and rushing the hip hop. There was no sleight against conservatives in this movie for sure.The issue of the daughter getting the crown is a progressive politics topic, but for the reasons we actually embrace progressivism in America: the daughter wasn't the better choice for the country because she's a woman, she was the better choice because she had trained her while life for the role and *is better qualified* them some dude from Queens. It is the law that needs to change when it forces unqualified or bad results.I imagine the pressure from Hollywood to have some redneck or Trump bashing in this film was heavy, and Eddie Murphy did not cave, he instead delivered an entertaining film full of talent that respected everybody and delivered in the spirit of the original.Ignore any bad reviews and go enjoy this movie.",Coming 2 America

John Landis is one of the best directors of this type of film and although he seems to have taken a backseat role in this outing his usual influence is not seen on the direction which is a great disappointment.Apart from the contrived storyline which you can simply skip over the rest seems to have been overplayed to the point of parody. Wesley Snipes hams it more than any other film he's ever been in, that's allot of ham. His character is nothing but a grotesque stereotype that detracts from everything else. If his part in this film was done differently I think it would have been for the better.It's not a film you will go back to watch again but it's ok till kill a couple of hours and has the occasional good point.",Coming 2 America

There was a totally predictable plot, not executed very well. Eddie looked insanely good, and he did ok. Wesley Snipes was a cartoon character. We all knew how the tale would end even before it began...and that is ok. We know how Cinderella ends, we know how Romeo and Juliet ends...yet there are many worthy versions to experience. The dance numbers were vulgar rather than regally African. There was waaaaay too much shuckin' and jivin'.Why did they cut the reference to Wakanda, that was in the trailer? That was funny.I agree with many, that the Barbershop scenes were funny. The rest of the film, sadly was neither funny, nor worthy of the eager anticipation so many of us had.I am sad now.

It's hard to compete with the original.Most of the well loved characters are back, and it's great to see them. A few of the new characters are very ""New millennium"". Of course, there is girl power, the overdone theme of so many movies today. The now standard CGI is plentiful. I'm not a Tracy Morgan fan, he strikes me as abrasive rather than funny, but to each his own.If not compared to the first movie, this is very good. To get all the jokes, you really need to have seen the first movie before watching the sequel, although it can stand on it's own.The movie has a good family message and is enjoyable.

The first 10-15 minutes are just cringeworthy with jokes that fall flat and make you feel embarrassed for the cast.
I'm sorry to say but the acting is just not good enough, from everyone involved. Eddie Murphy didn't have his natural unforced humour and charisma. It, at times, felt like he was not happy to be there and forced the smiles and jokes in the scene to get it over with. The camera work and editing in the fight training scene are shocking. I can only assume the product placement is a joke a la Wayne's World. The CGI is truly awful and the string of cameos is just bizarre as if trying to fit as many people as possible in a short time. Throw everything at it. I was expecting Denzel Washington, Will Smith, Jamie Fox and Kevin Heart to show up somewhere in that party.

I was 15 when the first installation premiered in 1988 and I'm so disappointed to see a classic comedy like the original Coming to America reduced to this over the top ""Nonsense,"" as King Jaffe would have put it! I was anticipating a smart sequel after 30 years, but instead got a film with way too many unnecessary cameos and few laughs. It was like, hey who wants a bit part in this Eddie Murphy sequel? And everyone who said I do, got a bit part! Like seriously, it was a slap in the face for some like Michael Blackson, an actual African comedian who could have shined, but instead was relegated to just a few bug-eyed, corny lines. And why was Rick Ross, the rapper in this? And Rotimi from ""Power"" acclaim playing Snipes' son wasn't given a single speaking line. Why?I don't even know who the kid that played (Murphy's) Akeem's son is, so it was wierd seeing an unknown opposite comedic genius Eddie. And Leslie Jones and Tracy Morgan did little to bring laughs to the fold, just more ghetto slapstick that was really unneeded. Snipes' character was over the top and cornballish, so much so he could have been straight outta an Austin Powers flick.In a previous review I voiced concern about Kenya Barris penning this script and as expected, he blew it!

Didn't take themselves too seriously and that adds to the fun. The entire cast was great, even the extras. It was filmed in the same lighthearted tone as the original.

And that's where it stayed - with very little update. I like that Shari Headley's Lisa gets a little bit of a personality, like for real, the girl IS from Queens. But the queen of this installment was Leslie Jones' Mary. I don't follow her, but she stole every scene. She was even the reason Lisa got some deserved tude.And I'll just stop there because we saw a little girl power, though Kiki Layne's Meeka was not used as much as I anticipated - especially after watching her in ""The Old Guard."" Also, Eddie Murphy's Akeem kept some self respect, so there's that as well as seeing old faces. For that it gets 5 out of 10.Oh, and the club scene splice was well done. Good job!",Coming 2 America

EVERYTHING is forced and really don't think I laughed at anything besides the original wife-to-be in C2A shows up early in the movie still hopping up and down and barking like a dog because Akeem never told her to stop.

The movie tries to be safe with some new elements, but the new stuff is so far out of place that it just feels awkward. I can see why this movie is made. The story with the son is very interesting and sometimes enjoyable, but eventually just falls into a callback story. It's very frustrating, because there are some really good moments in there.

329,filmsbyq,Better Than Expected,7,7 October 2021,"Sequels have always been seen as an easy way to make money in Hollywood. Even before the seventies penchant for adding a number to the end of a title to denote it being a sequel, Hollywood and the wider film industry were producing sequels, rehashing and reusing the same characters of a successful story in another film.It is a rare thing, the sequel that is as good or better than the original, especially if the original film is regarded as a good film. The better sequels tend to be made shortly after the original. The Godfather two, one of cinemas most lauded sequels, was released two years after its predecessor.Rocky two came three years after its parent film and The Empire Strikes Back, named in the old style of sequels where the title did not just gain a numbered appendage, also came three years after a genre-defining Star Wars.Some sequels have worked with a larger gap between films. Terminator 2: Judgement Day was released seven years after its epic originator. However, the intervening years saw such technological advances in film that the sequel proved to be an impressive spectacle. Unfortunately, subsequent efforts in the series have seen not only diminishing returns but also a definite lessening in quality.In terms of genre, dramatic action films tend to be easier to make sequels or series of. The characters are set and the story tends to be good versus evil, a relatively easy premise to work with. The comedy genre is not, generally, a good genre for sequels, especially if the film is a hit or classic.Scary Movie was amusing but was followed by increasingly wretched sequels. Similarly, the Police Academy films stretched a silly idea to the point of punishment for the eyes and mind. Great comedies are even harder to make sequels of. The likes of Airplane, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures and Ghostbusters have all spawned underwhelming sequels.That is not to say they were bad sequels or not funny, it is just that trying to recreate funny is a difficult skill. Thirty-three years on from its classic originator, Coming to America, stars Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall, plus many of the original cast, reprised their roles to make a sequel, Coming 2 America.Like many fans of the original film, I was not thrilled to hear about a sequel to one of the most quotable comedies of my life. Coming to America is, rightly, thought of as a comedy classic and probably Eddie Murphy's best film. Playing multiple roles, as does Hall, Murphy was at the height of his powers, having made his name on 48 hrs, Trading Places and two films in the Beverly Hills Cop series.Directed by John Landis, who was mostly known for directing Michael's Jackson's Thriller, even though he had directed many films before that including Animal House, Blues Brothers, Trading Places, starring Murphy, and An American Werewolf in London, the film that would get him the Thriller gig, Coming to America is gold.With a story by Murphy, Coming to America had an almost entirely black cast and was a comedy that contained very little of the comedy staples laid down in the previous decade's blaxploitation era comedies. There was no hoes, no drugs, no thugs, no shucking and jiving, none of the expected staples of 'black' comedy.Set in the fictional land of Zamunda - think Wakanda without the technological advancements - Coming to America was a very different black comedy. Whereas before, Eddie had been the funny, wisecracking, black guy in a white world, in Coming to America he was still a funny black guy but he was displaced in a black world.Coming to America was a hit both domestically and worldwide, with the humour in the film still bearing up more than three decades on. So, what about the sequel? Unsurprisingly, it is not as good as the original. Many have quickly come out to deride it as being a poor, money-grabbing, unfunny effort. That is not true.Coming 2 America, whilst not been as funny as the original, is better than one could have hoped for with some genuine laugh-out-loud moments. Wesley Snipes' General Izzi is a great addition and Leslie Jones as Mary Junson, mother of Murphy's Akeem's illegitimate son, Lavelle (Jermaine Fowler), plays to her stereotype but it works well within the context of the film.The film keeps the laughs coming but still manages to fashion a pleasant story, romcom, in amongst the silliness. Fowler's role as the would-be heir to Zamunda is a difficult role for any actor to undertake, especially as he was always going to be in Murphy's shadow. Fowler bears the burden well, with the story split between him and Murphy's Akeem.There are some clever nods to the original film with one particularly funny reprise coming from Vanessa Bell Calloway. The barbershop is back, even though all of the patrons of the shop were old men in the first film! And, for me, the return of Sexual Chocolate is a real boon.Like many sequels, Coming 2 America will always suffer when compared to its predecessor, the original being such an unknown quantity at the time but becoming a classic over time. If one can watch the film in isolation, something made easier by the fact that one does not need to have seen the first film to understand this one, it is an amusing comedy in its own right.With a one-hundred-and-eight minutes runtime, Coming 2 America is slightly over the rom-com standard ninety minutes but is about ten minutes shorter than its predecessor. The film moves at a good pace with the only dips being when the story strays into rom-com territory, though the dips are slight and do not detract from the comedy too much.It was always going to be a herculean task to match the magic of the first film or to even make a film that does not offend or alienate the rose-tinted vision of the original's many fans. Coming 2 America just about manages it.",Coming 2 America

332,Defected74,Black comedies have lost their comedic sense of worth,7,9 March 2021,"Let's be honest, Coming To America was funny because black comedies back then where all about being stereotypical and making fun of the ghetto for the sole reason of making you laugh, and this had none of that comedy gold. Coming 2 America felt bland and did not have anything overly ridiculous that would make you laugh. Eddie Murphy let white people (aka Netflix) strip the script of anything that would be considered ""racist"" or ""edgy"". This movie clearly defines the carefully cautious mindeset the US is trying to become, and for this reason alone this movie lost its comedic value. I only gave it a 7 because I was glad to see so many of the original actors from the first movie, and because I overly enjoyed En Vogue with Salt N Peppa.",Coming 2 America
333,mha-89327,African Americans Sing and Dance in a Caucasian Version of Black American Life,4,3 April 2021,"'Coming 2 America' is a typical Hollywood production which attempts to recapture and re-exploit the nostalgia of the 1980s with a resurgent focus upon the original story's royal family legacies. Unquestionably, many of the actors and musicians are eminently talented beyond any relevant measure; although, taste in an entirely subjective expression. However, one has to wonder, in a country, the United States of America, where ethnic relations remain at an all-time low; in the final analysis, 'Is this production in anyway representative of African American daily life?' Does it really celebrate African Americans or just Hollywood's version of a commercialised Black America as it perceives it?America, as a collective of disparate states, still remains unreconciled to its historical roots and politico-cultural foundations. Economic and political power has evolved, borne on the backs of African slaves, written in their blood, sweat and genocidal victimhood. Life for the African slave seems entirely distant from this comedic event.Arguably, this production is a mockery of the American cultural legacy of severe acculturation imposed by the social and economic genocide of African tribespeople. Remember, many, many thousands of Africans were trafficked from their homeland, raped and enslaved into forced labour, stripped of their culture, values, beliefs and social and political self-determination. It remains an unreconciled artefact of complete and utter national shame.In light of the current state of race relations in the United States, one has to wonder at the brazen cultural ignorance of promoting such a production in the interests of shallow and momentary entertainment. To me, this Caucasian version of African American culture seems sterile and overly synthetic - a white man's version of the Black American ethos.Furthermore, it seems to celebrate the harsh reality and horrendous disparities which reflect the under-privileged and vilified reality of life for most African Americans living in the United States, today. To say this production, released in 2021, in the wake of the legacy of pandemic induced and recognised cultural, social, economic and political, ethnic disparities and inequalities, is poorly considered and entirely in the worse taste possible - hardly seems to cover it.Only in America. Let's all dance and sing and believe the past never happened while African Americans continue to struggle with the legacy of their enslavement and cultural depravation and impoverishment and incarceration. Just like colonisation, genocide is a social and political process which does not stop until the past is appropriately reconciled for those who remain as evidence of its legacy.",Coming 2 America

I laughed out loud many times and smiled the rest just to see something that was light, funny, a little heart, and didn't speak one word of political anything. Sure the plot is wafer-thin but that's not the point. It's good to see people fall in love and talk about their feelings again. Extremely refreshing. And after Murphy's fantastic ""Dolomite Is My Name,"" his triumphant showing on SNL, and this - hopefully one of Hollywood's funniest is staging a comeback from quite a few dry years in which nothing he did was funny.

This is a movie that didn't try to take itself seriously. There are some good actors doing cameos and the occasional great song (eg. Digital Underground's Humpty Dance).
The film lacks originality. It totally failed ox the modern ""diversity"" and ""inclusiveness"" and ""equity"" test. To be honest, there's little to like.

Even if the idea and the actors have a lots of potential, you don't really connect to any of the characters enough to see it working as a romcom, and that's likely because of the visionless screenplay & equally visionless direction. You do have many 2020s cliches, such as few tiny teen girls can beat up a squad of big veteran soldier, and even a pretty weird scene in which a happily smiling 12 year old girl crushes the testicles of an adult man with a stick.I loved many of Eddie Murphys films back in the 80s. And then Dolemite was very good, so I'm definitely for his comeback. I hope following sequels will be much better.TLDR: I liked the first one back in the 80s, so before seeing Coming 2 America I hoped it would have at least some of the spirit.

Well done by Murphy and Hall. Also, to the neigh-sayers posting this movie as ""deplorable""; it's just a movie... about 2 hours out of the day away from masks, social distancing and Covid shots.

386,smithnumber,Nothing says comedy gold like a farting CGI lion ...,4,23 July 2021,"Is this as awful as the reviews would imply? Yes it is, but it is also extremely watchable in a non-taxing way. Eddie Murphy reprises his role as African Prince Akeem, minus the humor and charisma that made him a box office draw in the 80s. Actually, I'm a bit worried about Eddie. The script is basically structured so he says no more than about 10 words at a time which makes me wonder if the excesses if the 80s lifestyle might actually have caught up with him. Or maybe he just couldn't be bothered to put that much effort and was more focused on the paycheck.What is impressive is the production design and costumes. Some of them are great, although for a story set largely in African the whole thing has a very African-American tone. But cultural accuracy and logic are in short supply here, but who really cares when 80s songbirds Salt-N-Pepa make an appearance and the king's son squawks out a Prince cover?The story is a simple one. Will the long-lost son of the king end up with the wise and beautiful woman beneath his station? Will the feisty (I hate that word) daughter be recognized as the rightful heir to the throne instead of the dopey son? Will the gang from Queens show those African snobs a thing or two? You'll know the answer to these questions before the movie has even started, but the journey to get there is undemanding entertainment.

It's largely forgettable. I chuckled once or twice during the movie. I cringed at the heavy handed, sledgehammer to the face way I'm told yet again, racism is bad and women are equal to men. I agree with those messages but do they really have to be to overtly hammered home?We have Eddie's son facing a young white racist during an job interview. We have Eddies daughter being passed over for ruler of Zimunda in favor of the son based purely on gender. Zero subtlety, zero intelligence and zero laughs. Surely there is a writer out there with a way of adding these messages to a movie without using the storytelling equivalent of slipping on a banana skin.There were a few 'look here, and old famous person' cameos and some poorly utilized classic Eddie characters from the original (Sexual Chocolate guy was the worst).No one will be watching this movie a second time, let alone in 30 years.",Coming 2 America

I understand that it is supposed to be funny but that is the reality. Idiots living like kings in riches, having private shows by big stars dressing up in the tackiest rich way when the people in Africa are dying of thirst and starvation. the movie also teaches us that women still don't have the same rights and they're not considered equals to men meaning a one night stand can be a king... and these facts are shown as jokes. There are about 10 minutes of good fun humour when they're not being offensive to women, gays, poor people, disabled and old people. The writers forgot we live in 2021.",Coming 2 America

Wardrobe was beautiful.Honestly, given that the first movie was such a classic I guess I was expecting a bit more. I don't understand why the idea of this one didn't go to the big screen. Im sure it would have done well. This sequel definitely doesn't have any elements of the original. It lacked a certain elegance and I felt that there were scenes in there that didnt need to be there (mainly a lot of the music scenes). The character that played Meeka was very strong and if the movie centered around her more maybe it would have given it that original feel.At certain times it felt like a mockery of African culture and some character's accents were on and off like they'd have the Zamunda accent and then it would be an American accent and then back to the Zamundan accent and so that took away from the authenticity. I cringed a bit at Leslie's character but then grew to love her in the end. I especially loved Wesley Snipes' character.Lastly there seemed to be a fusion of Black American and African culture which was nice to see.",Coming 2 America

The movie is like a cheesy fan fic version of itself, pretty much everyone from the original comes back in some way plus a whole lot more. Definitely cruder than the first one (if that's even possible) with a lot of schmalzty romance and not-so-subtle political statements.

408,letande,Didn't happen...,1,5 March 2021,"* SIGH * And here it is, the second ""blast from the past"" disappointment in a row... First, we've got Tom & Jerry with Spike crapping all over the place and now? Now we've got this. Like everybody else, I loved the original movie. Together with Trading Places, it was, like, one of the best comedies from eighties. So, even though I tried to keep my expectations here as low as possible to avoid being disappointed much, I still hoped for good. Like Agent Mulder? I wanted to believe. Unfortunately... yeah. You know how it is. Didn't happen. Like... at all.First of all, it's exactly as forced as you may expect. Every single scene and every single line here screams ""forced"". The original Coming to America was daring, it was fresh and, well, it was... you know... FUN. This? It's just a forced mess. One of those movies that you forget right after you're done watching. Heck, it was actually hard not to fall asleep here. The main idea wasn't really that bad (long story short, the new movie tried to focus on Zamunda instead of Queens), but writing is so terrible that... seriously, how many people worked on the story and screenplay here?Coming 2 America (the one who came up with the title alone should be punished) is one of those movies where some random people talk about some random stuff and you just sit there, wondering why in the freakin' world should you care and when this torture will finally end. Watching this movie? It's like visiting your distant relatives. It's kinda boring, it's kinda awkward and you can't stop thinking about just how much you want to go home. And guess what? The movie is almost two hours long, so I'm really glad that I watched it at home where it was easy to take a break and do some more exciting stuff. Like watching the paint dry, for example. Watching this movie in one sit? It's plain boring. Sure, humor is a subjective thing, but while I laughed all the time while watching the original (still do), this time? I didn't even smile once. It's THAT uninspired. Every time there was an attempt for a joke, I was like ""good grief, seriously?"". The original impact so-o-o ins't here...Also, it's a bit too woke. In a bad way. I mean, don't get me wrong. I like woke stuff. Adds quite a lot to the impact, as long as the writing is right. Then again, you know how it is. There are times when such stuff feels natural. When it does make you care. And there are times when it feels painfully forced, out of the place and actually plays against the writing. You can't just make things interesting and exciting just by saying the right things, you know? You need a good writing to make people feel involved. Here? It feels like nobody even cared. They took one of the most popular comedy movies from eighties, they've tried to re-create some of the most famous parts (like those scenes in the barber shop), they've tried to copy / past some of the old jokes (without much success since, like I said, the original impact is long gone), they've added some woke stuff just because it's a right thing to do and BOOM! Your new Amazon Prime movie is ready. Seriously, guys, those female Ghostbusters were more funny and exciting than this. And I never thought I'll say that. Like... ever!The only thing I actually liked was Akeem's daughters (one of which is played by Eddie Murphy's real daughter, Bella), but guess what? They've barely used the characters. Seriously, even though there was, like, a ton of potential, the girls barely appeared at the beginning and near the end of the movie. While the rest of the thing was just our painfully generic stuff from all those Eddie Murphy movies nobody really cared about. You know, Dr. Dolittle, Nutty Professor... I really wonder if the man is cursed, or something. After the initial success in movies like 48 Hrs., Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, the movies with him started to feel EXTREMELY forced in uninspired. And this one? Heck, even Meet Dave was more funny than this.Not only Coming 2 America was unable to repeat the original success, it's also one of those sequels that actually ruin the original quite a lot. Not only it's forced and isn't funny at all, it ended up ruining good old characters. Lisa McDowell, for example, feels absolutely terrible now, while Cleo barely have a reason to appear. Not only this movie won't make you laugh, there's a big chance it'll actually make you feel sad. Just because seeing a great movie from your childhood being ruined in such a poor way? It's... you know... SAD. Dixi.",Coming 2 America

If you were a cult follower of the original Coming to America, you will fully appreciate this 21st century version to appeal to new-young and old-familiar audiences...alike. Thanks to Eddie Murphy who did a good job of giving fans what they've been begging for for over 30 years. To appreciate this movie which he and original cast members considered a "" labor of love,"" it helps to have watched the original from 1988.
In Coming 2 America, Murphy took on the great task of combining the original love story plot of Akeem and Lisa with the new plot of passing on the Zamunda kingdom. Also new scenes of Zamunda's setting were beautifully interspersed with flashes of the beloved original Queens locations. The best of all were the touching performances of the original cast members like John Amos, James Earl Jones, Arsenio Hall, Shari Headley and the barbershop crew(all looking great 30 years later), along with Wesley Snipes and Leslie Jones. This movie was also a meaningful platform for many up and coming actors. The result was a funny, very nostalgic, yet contemporary movie and a job well done!",Coming 2 America

The premise is great in that, Akeem, left a little secret behind in America and it's time to answer that call. So much time passing works well for that premise also. I don't want to give anything away as it's not exactly a thick plot. I will say some of it, plot and jokes, was predictable. Sequels always have that uphill battle.

446,rdmceagles,Why???,1,7 March 2021,Took a perfectly sweet movie about a prince looking for his true love and warped it into some typical garbage sequel. anyone who saw the original knows that Akeem wasn't looking for some one night stand and to make leslie jones that person is unreal. she's a beast compared to sweet Lisa that he ended up with. and way to perpetuate the typical black stereotype of a black woman who has a child with no father in the picture. the only redeeming quality was the barbershop scene and that's it.

Not great but okay and definitely worth a watch.It did a good job of pulling al ot of the original characters in so there was a lot of fan service.It nicely showed the lives of the characters after the first movie.Did the drama seem real? Well no.Maybe they should have followed the heroes tale in that the son could have let everyone down and then redeemed himself. Even doing the same with Akeem would had added to the drama.The danger from the general never seemed real. Let him kidnap the daughter instead of letting her beat 100kg men (but show here escaping on her own) would have added some suspense and realism.Anyway, it's still a good movie and obviously a work of love from many of the characters.",Coming 2 America

All hype, great costumes, and storylines that are all over the place -- but nothing comes together, nothing works in the end.

He goes to fine this child to save his kingdom. Of course, nothing goes as planned as he realizes that he has become his father and forgotten himself. To be true to yourself! He denied his most faithful eldest daughter because of an outdated tradition by trying to replace her with a child who knew nothing of the people, culture, or traditions of the land. He disrespected himself and all of his family due to fear. In the end, he saw himself in his son when he threw it all away for love. Like father, like son.
I'm not sure what people were expecting. This was a great sequel. There were a few rough areas that are easily overlooked. The cast was GREAT! All of the original cast returned and the new additions were wonderful! WARDROBE DEPARTMENT DID THEIR THANG!!! I can't leave out the dancing!
This movie was full of love and expression. A great example about how women are smart, strong, and brave yet often overlooked. A great example of a man learning who he is, tapping into his emotional side to combine it with his mental THEN, making a decision. An example of how Black people are treated in the work place, among each other, and how we have feelings, too!

This movie takes you on a nostalgic trip back to another time when feel good movies ruled the silver screen (1990s). And it plays out just like a movie from that era in the cutsie way the story unfolds, the simple characters and amusing scenes. Its actually kind of refreshing in today's cynical, subversive-addicted, media-scape.
If you loved the original, this movie is full of nostalgia. Its a shame some of Eddie and Arseon's original characters don't get to shine more - like the barbershop guys and Revered Brown; though present they are missing some of the edgy pizzaz they had in the original.

There's one character that I just found to be plain annoying. And Wesley Snipes was cringy. His whole character was a joke, but not in a funny way.There's some CGI in this movie and it is bad by today's standards. I'd say it's on par with Jumanji from 1995.It looks like the majority of this movie's budget went to the cast and there wasn't much left for anything else.If you're an adult that loves the original, watch the trailer for this movie and spend your time on something else instead.

From the odd and unnecessary celebrity cameos to the forced rehashed jokes, the beginning of each scene felt like a nostalgic reveal, like ""I wonder which returning actor is going to appear now and is he/she going to say their signature line(s)?"" Even the barber shop scenes were just awkward.Many times I could tell Eddie Murphy was trying extra hard to stay in character, almost like he had trouble taking the role seriously (even though it's a comedy).What I find ironic is that in the original Coming to America, Lisa was a strong, confident, hard-working black woman (and it wasn't crammed down our throats). In this sequel, she's reduced to a silent, bitter queen who apparently isn't allowed (or doesn't care) to voice her concerns to Akeem. We don't see her confidence, business expertise or leadership skills benefitting Zamunda's economy (considering her fundraising efforts and growing her dad's restaurant in CTA). Even Madge Sinclair (the OG queen from CTA) naturally commanded respect and occasionally put James Earl Jones' character in check which didn't require woke politics.I'm just glad this was already included in my Amazon Prime subscription, because I would not have paid money to see it.

513,zorkfrobozz,Awful and predictable at every turn,4,29 May 2021,"After the beginning credits, it's takes all of 20 seconds to see that the goal of this production was to cater to this new, temporary ""wokeness"" trend. Unfortunately it makes every scene, and every detail of every scene, very predictable. I loved the original, as everyone else did, and this sequel was very disappointing.I keep hoping that Eddie Murphy will do at least one more good movie but it just doesn't seem like it will happen. 😟",Coming 2 America
514,Sowerplave,Not a bad movie for those who loved the original movie - 6/10,4,7 March 2021,"I do not believe that Coming to America needed a sequel at all. Having watched it, I'm still not convinced that this movie was necessary at all. The plot of Akeem having an illegitimate child sounds illogical and unreasonable, given how much of a decent and modest guy the character was in the original movie. While this is acknowledged in the explanation of it, it still comes off as too stretched of a long shot to explain the premise in a conceivable way.Plot-wise, this movie is unnecessary. But I still had fun watching this movie. With tons of references and throwbacks to the original movie, this sequel is a fun love letter to a great comedy movie. I love the original movie long enough to share and understand this love letter in motion.Barely a worthy watch for those who absolutely loved this movie. This movie is literally recycling the original plot, and inverting the premise, without feeling particularly funny or fresh at all.5/10.",Coming 2 America

Eddie Murphy's daughters.
Seeing so many of the original characters 30 years later.
Lots of beautiful costumes.
Fun musical numbers.
John Legend
Trevor NoahThe Bad:
Ridiculous & pointless plot.
Lack of likable characters.There was tons of talented folks crammed into this. Too bad most of that talent was either under utilized or over shadowed by nonsensical scene drafting, and blathering dialogue.How unfortunate and ""L""ame.",Coming 2 America

They each play too many roles while they could be introducing more black actors to the world. That aside, it isn't very funny unless Jones is on-screen.

Also, for a movie about 'coming' to America, they only spend about 10 minutes there for the entire film. Sure there were a few good chuckles, particularly with the barber shop characters, but so much of the humour fell flat. Some of the central characters were quite annoying too. I can appreciate the fact however, that it seems like the people involved were trying to make something decent at the least.",Coming 2 America
530,wynwar,A rare Eddie flick that'll put you to sleep,3,17 March 2021,I can't fathom why they chose to make this sad pathetic excuse of a sequel. Every actor seems to have been flogged into submission to act in this one. There is no heart and of course no humor. You will not be to blame if you fall asleep half way through the movie.

535,fvga_dix,Really bad,1,24 March 2021,"This movie is so bad that I am wondering what the decision making process is like in Hollywood for making and releasing a movie. Not funny at all, which is hard to achieve with this cast. Is everyone just surrounded with 'yes -men'? Not one person in the whole process said ""This is complete garbage!""?They should have made it more like a 'where are they now' docu, which it basically is. Lack of creativity is really shocking to be honest. Everyone from the '80's movie is brought out for 5 sec, is that supposed to be funny?What made me smile just for a second was sadly quickly followed by a cringe worthy appearance. The introduction of General Izzi for me was the slightly funny bit, but the following dance by said general makes you cry. Leslie Jones, I love her, is just a mismatch for this cast as are Morgan Freeman and Wesley Snipes. They appear like a cartoon sketch.On the whole I'm hugely disappointed, an obvious money motivated release.",Coming 2 America

Whether is was the direction or the writing, it's hard to tell, but they tried to make this movie too PC and meaningful...that's when the story got tiresome. The audience doesn't want to be preached at, we get it already.The son's storyline was extremely boring. During several of his scenes we left the room, got more drinks and returned when his dialogue was over.However, Arsenio Hall, Eddie Murphy, Wesley Snipes, Lesley Jones (and the characters they played) made us laugh out loud several times.

We liked the characters. We liked John Amos as McDowell. We liked Akeem. We lied Semmi. There was a silly charm that transcended the cornball of the original film.This time, however, the acting, on occasion in the original played purposefully wooden, was often bad. Snipes simply didn't work. Fowler was cringe inducing, none of the daughters stood out.Arsenal had a fabulous 2 1/2 hour interview with Howard Stern promoting the movie. The interview was fantastic. It's length seemed like nothing compared to the movie. Hall did a good job promoting and I was looking forward to more of a nostalgic hook. But it just wasn't there.
The cameos were the most exciting part, wondering who was nextThere is a history of failed sequels when separated by so much timeThe Godfather III was 16 years after the Oscar Winning Godfather II, 18 years after The Godfather.

546,corpse_man,"Predictably ""modern"" retread of the original",1,30 March 2021,"From the 40 min I watched, It seemed just like a more politically correct version of the original. From the moment in the beginning of the movie where it showed the daughters kicking ass with their Ninja style training, I basically knew the whole plot, right there, I concluded the son was going to be an incompetent fool, and the movie is going to be about how the Kingdom should go to the daughters. Why did assume this? Because I've seen the same plot about 50 times in the last 2 years.To be clear, nothing is wrong with the idea of equality, its great, im all for it It's just, the fact the same plot has been in pretty much every movie in at least some form in the last 2 years. ""Damn the evil patriarchy"", and women are just as good as men, just as strong, just as fast, just as smart, etc etc. Im im not even getting into actual biology here.I'm really confused why there such a hard push for this lately, there was plenty of strong female leads in television and tv even 20 years ago. For example, Sarah Connor in Terminator 2, Ellen Ripley in the Alien(s) films, Captain Janeway in Star Trek Voyager, Samantha Carter in Star Gate SG1, I could go on and on, and these were all VERY strong female characters from around 20 years ago, who were all strong leaders, very intelligent, independant, and physically capable in combat, (even if they couldn't beat up every single man in the world). And back then, the shows were just enjoyable, and not so blatantly crammed with the anti Patriarchy message at the expense of having an actual plot.For those of you who have seen the film Noelle, a movie about a female who becomes the new Santa Claus and fights against the patriarchy, this is almost the exact same film plot, just in a ""Coming to America"" package.If this movie came out 30 years ago, I probably would have loved it, and found it inspiring, fresh, and brave. But at this point in time, it's just predictable, trendy, band wagon jumping, over political, boring crap.I clicked on the button for containing spoilers, but really, the entire movie can be predicted easily in the first 5 min anyway.Can we for the love of god, just have a fun comedy this decade, that's not about the evil patriarchy?",Coming 2 America

Although I must say one very strong aspect of the sequel was how strongly linked it was to the first movie and how almost all cast were present to pick up where they started over 30 years ago. You hardly see that even in sequels after 3-4 years.
The storyline as a sequel was also good, but I think where it lacked was they should have gone deeper in each piece instead of keeping it light on each topic and giving the son too much airtime spending on nonsense. The casting for that wasn't as strong in my opinion. Otherwise overall was a great sequel.",Coming 2 America

Great acting and cast and they haven't missed a beat, but even gained a few. Look, I am white, and hard to impress on comedies, but I must say that these ratings are clearly from ( and I heard a little about this) people paid to downrate movies for their own agendas. It is totally unfair to put this in a low rated category to say the least. If you like Coming to America, You will definitely like this movie, the comedy and the acting. To me, the 1st is a classic.

568,thdudeabides,Nostalgic but not as good as the first film,6,14 March 2021,"I really wanted to score this higher than a 6/10 but I just couldn't. Nearly all of the original cast were reunited, which is worthy of a 10/10 on its own. Unfortunately the film is just not funny enough.There are some nice homages paid to characters from the first film, but the main characters in this just aren't as nostalgic as you want them to be. The film reminisces and it is inevitable that you do too when watching and, whilst you do, you realise how endearing and funny the first film was compared to the recycled jokes in this. The best joke by far can be heard in a barber shop scene.General Izzi I thought was a good addition and Wesley Snipes came across well as usual as an antagonistic character. Unfortunately I couldn't say the same for Mary Junson and Uncle Reem. The two characters were just irritating and an unwanted distraction.The plot would have been better without these characters. The inclusion of Eriq La Salle (Darryl), Allison Dean (Patricia) and Samuel L Jackson would have probably made for a far better movie. It is a real shame they couldn't make the scheduling work to get them to reprise their roles as it would have been interesting to see how these characters' lives have fared over the last 30+ years. The plot would have probably been a lot more interesting with Darryl, Patricia and their Soul Glo enterprise involved.For all the hype and 30+ years in the waiting, the result is a surprisingly dull and disappointingly tame funny-in-parts movie.",Coming 2 America

YupBut here's what I did like about the movieI love how they had a bunch of the original cast in this movie, and I loved seeing Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall playing the multiple characters, though when you look at it how in the heck would these people be still alive lol.Leslie Jones and Tracy Morgan playing brother and sister was perfect, they definitely look like they could be related just based on their personalities. Loud and obnoxious lol.Other than that I thought this was decent, not better than the original or even equal to the original, but this was still entertaining. Most sequels (with the exception of the Lethal Weapon franchise and the Back to the Future franchise IMO) don't do well to impress the original audience.It's great to see these characters back on the screen, but this sequel probably would have been better if it came out 10-20 years ago.",Coming 2 America

There are some awkward parts and there are moments when I wish I could go back 20 years to Eddie's Beverly Hills Cop days but I think it's a decent effort and it was entertaining.,Coming 2 America

577,tripper-09331,I set a low bar and was still disappointed,4,7 March 2021,"I expected the sequel to probably be a rehash of jokes and forgettable. I was hoping for some fun throwbacks and easter eggs. There were some throwbacks but a poor and predictable rehashing of jokes. The worse part about the movie was the attempt to make it have a message and be a drama. The pacing was slow and the main actors felt like they were holding back (probably to keep the PG-13 rating). Finally the end was rushed. The last 10 minutes come out of nowhere and tries to quickly tie up loose ends, giving no reward for toughing out the previous grueling 90 minutes. This movie would of been better if they kept it rated R and didn't focus so much on trying to send a message.",Coming 2 America
578,hayesmikiet,A welcome gift after 2020!,9,20 March 2021,"Sorry haters, but I loved it! I don't understand why so many people were so negative about and unforgiving of this sequel. Either they have no senses of humor or they're simply old sticks in the mud! While there are some forced places (as in most comedies), they did an absolutely phenomenal job of recapturing the chemistry of the cast and spirit of the original movie. Loved seeing Eddie and Arsenio back together. And the barbershop guys! Leslie Jones was HILARIOUS!! Wesley Snipes (equally funny!), Tracy Morgan, and Morgan Freeman were wonderful big-name additions to the cast. The king hosting his own funeral was a wonderful touch, introducing lots of fun surprises. My favorite part was when Lisa and Mary bonded. In general, it was a lot of fun when they flashed-back to original scenes, and the outtakes during the credits were icing on the cake - Eddie's humor particularly shines there, as he plays more of a straight man as Akim. About five minutes before the end of the movie, I said to someone that my only regret was that Randy Watson (Sexual Chocolate) wasn't in the movie. Within a minute, there was the band singing ""We are Family,"" and it was hysterical! Bringing everyone from Queens to Zamunda was really satisfying, too. The writers did a great job of bringing some out-of-date thinking into the 21st century and dealing openly with it. My favorite moment was when Cleo reminded Akim to think about what advice his mother would have given him... I had just been missing the Queen and her wisdom, so it was a lovely nod to Madge S. All I can say is while likely nothing would have lived up to the original (or the Soul Glo moment,) everyone seriously needs to lighten up!

The new characters are 2 dimensional, bland or just plain annoying. The humour is forced, the jokes don't land and whilst some out-of-place political jabs don't detract from the movie too much, they are superfluous and add nothing to the story.

As with most sequels, the attempts to re-create memorable and appealing elements from the original movie just doesn't work the second time around, and new actors in this movie -- most notably Jermaine Fowler (who plays Ahkeem's illegitimate son) and Leslie Jones (as the ""baby mama"") -- do minimal to revive the humor of the first movie. Wesley Snipes appearance as an antagonist African dictator certainly doesn't help much either, and cameos by Morgan Freeman, as well as guest musical performances by En Vogue and Salt 'n Pepa, do little to bolster entertainment. The obvious problem with this movie is that they should have never waited over 30 years to make it, with many of the principal actors transitioning from young to old. Eddie and Arsenio, now borderline senior citizens, simply just didn't have the comedic energy in this movie to make it as entertaining and appealing as they did when they were young men in the original film.Don't waste your time and money.",Coming 2 America

This new version has most of the characters from the first movie that they created, but with a new story line that brought in new characters that were just not as funny. So I got laughs from the originals characters and so so laughs from the new characters. They used CGI to take us back to the original movies time period showing Eddie and Arsenio looking for girls, and I would much rather seen that story line continue throughout the movie instead of messing with a new son situation though I know this would of been hard to do since Eddie's character didn't do much dating in the first movie.

600,cmhouser,An unfortunate and lazy remake of an easy favorite,3,5 March 2021,"Where to start. Let me say, I was very excited for this film. I was in my teens for this original Coming to America and it quickly became one of my favorite over the years. Sadly, I was extremely disappointed. First with the good because there is little of it in this film, IMO.The good: It's great to see Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall and Wesley Snipes starring movies together. They all need to do more. Shari Headley is timelessly beautiful and hasn't really aged much. The fun scenes involve Murphy playing his usual old barbershop roles and it's really the best part of this film and seems to be the most well thought out parts of it.The bad: Terribly predictable script that felt like it was in development for five minutes total. Simply put, it's boring. It uses some of the exact same themes as the last film with extremely predictable twists that could be seen coming from a mile away. Who could have seen the dichotomy of a woman princess wanting to take power but tradition stopping it?! Everyone. Everyone could see this script coming. The acting outside the main actors was OK but bland. The jumps back and forth between Africa and America are nonsensical. Actually, the entire film was a hodgepodge of a nonsensical script that was stitched together with very little originality.To sum up Coming 2 America, it really felt like someone said ""let's make a sequel by throwing a bunch of money at the actors and the film while we quickly throw together a script"". This film also desperately missed John Landis in the directing chair. It kind of sucks that all these years have gone by and in 2021 someone just wanted some quick ratings and money in the pocket so they wasted a great opportunity to remake a classic comedy by making it a throw away film.",Coming 2 America

The movie is not quite as bad as some reviewers say but still a disappointment.I do not mind the daughter getting to rule at the end and the girl who plays her does a decent job. I just mind it being painfully obvious and drawn out it is to the smarter 99 percent of the people watching the movie that this is going to happen. The most absurd part is three young girls and a man in their 50's taking out an entire army of armed terrorists with sticks. McDowell's putting out a vegan burger and the need to remind us that the preacher is a sexist before he appears are also examples of trying way too hard to be PC.On the positive side, There were a few funny parts with the barber shop and some of the other Queens residents and I found the song at the end to be a nice overall character tribute.This movie is a product of the woke era, where the blatant and painfully obvious effort to not offend anyone and show that they are conforming gets in the way of being consistent humorous and having a coherent plot line.Watch it once with lowered expectations for the nostalgia if you were a huge fan of the original movie but besides that, it is not worth the time.",Coming 2 America

Special kudos to ""Randy Watson and Sexual Chocolate""! Their performance brought down the house! Lol. When I wasn't laughing, the movie still held my attention, and kept me very engaged and entertained.Is the movie perfect? No. Writers still fall back on the same types of situations and character motivations to generate drama/tension, that just don't reflect how real people would behave in a given situation. That's a small quibble though, because pretty much ALL stories to some extent do that. But in this case, you can tell a lot thought and caring went into the making of this movie in order to create something that honored the original...And they succeeded.Bottom line: As my review heading says, all-in-all, this move greatly exceeded my expectations, and I'm glad I watched it.",Coming 2 America

I did think at one point Eddie should get out of comedy, and perhaps do something like a John Wick movie, (the extra weight he's carrying, plus a couple of looks he threw around in some of the scenes brought me to that thought!!), but then, I would probably still avoid it because it's got Eddie in it.Only watch it if your brain doesn't work!",Coming 2 America

Why?
Has more product placements than a James Bond movie. McDonalds (in multiple scenes), Crown Royal, Bulgari, Pepsi, Spotify, Friskies, Puma, Nautica, Coors Light, Chevrolet (Malibu), Lyft, Bose, Apple, and Tesla to name a few of the blaring obvious.
Then there was the multi-punch cameos of En Vogue, Salt 'n' Pepa, Lil Kim, and Gladys Knight. I think John Legend whined a song during the credits.
The jokes fall flat. As one reviewer wrote, the film gives viewers the impression that black culture is about weird phrases and hip-hop music. Frustrating and vastly self-depreciating.
Every major black actor had a role, and yes, even Morgan Freeman. I was half expecting to see Denzel Washington or Jamie Foxx pop up. The only two white characters in a speaking role were a dithering tit for the 'McDonalds"" corporation and an accused business owner who was being accused of being handed everything. Very cringe-worthy.
And by far the worst part, is that this is almost a carbon-copy of 2003's ""What A Girl Wants"". Not seen it? Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth. Much better story line, warm-hearted, far funnier and charming all the way.

It's not a psychological or cerebral film, it's FUN! That's it. Weren't movies originally invented to entertain the masses?This film is packed with classic stars with decades of acting and entertaining experience under their belts. Why not sit back and enjoy. Arsenio isn't Charlton Heston, but neither was Bob Hope or Jerry Lewis! So what? Road to Bali was fun to watch, but face it, not a lot of redeeming intellectual value! And that's ok.Eddie Murphy's acting has always been an enigma to me. He's not a comedian trying to play act. He has always appeared to take it seriously, as seriously as Eddie Murphy can, but he's really better at it than most give him credit for. I may be wrong, but Beverly Hills Cop is pretty much the standard to rate comedy films and he was a natural for that role. Same with Trading Places and first Coming to America.I started watching Murphy from his start as a comedian. From wild child to arrogant superstar, to questionable superstar, to out of spotlight family man, to surprisingly good father, to his return as a wiser senior actor and person. This movie is fun, great fun to see the gang from first Coming to America together again. Was fun to laugh and reminisce about ""Mcdougal's"" and great reminder to never jump to conclusions about race, wealth and social status. I noticed the first film is back on the top viewed list. Was a film with an enlightening message to us when we were the young adults (we're the seniors now!) and great lesson for current generations.So don't watch this expecting anything. Just enjoy and laugh a little. Better yet, get some popcorn and watch both with your kids or friends. Not a bad way to spend a few hours!",Coming 2 America

Even some of 10 star reviews are unnecessarily whiny. People love to talk about Daddy Issues - what about Mommy Issues? Apparently a lot of people with Mommy Issues don't like the movie, because they can't stand to see a woman in charge. She didn't become queen just because she's a woman. She became Queen because she was highly qualified, compared to her brother who had no experience in royalty whatsoever. I guess people are expecting a comedy like ""Airplane"" or something. Maybe they expected the sequel to have the same values as a 30 YEAR OLD MOVIE. Imma need these fools to get with the times.",Coming 2 America

A film celebrating ""Coming to America"" (1988)",8,7 March 2021,"C2A (2021) features a funny, heart-warming and plausible storyline backed by a stellar cast of legends from CTA (1988) and a fresh cohort of terrific actors who delivered stellar performances.CTA (1998) was, and always will be a classic. I was disappointed by other reviewers who panned C2A (2021) - what did they expect? C2A (2021) was the 'encore' celebrating a generation of legendary actors such as James Earl Jones, Arsenio Hall & John Amos - not forgetting Nile Rodgers who created the soundtrack for CTA (1998)For those of us like me who loved CTA (1988), C2A (2021) features every possible nostalgic reference to CTA (1988) enabling us to live through the same laughs, cringes and jokes from a 2021 lens.Actors Jermaine Fowler (Lavelle Junson), Leslie Jones (Mary Junson), Kiki Layne (Meeka) and Nomzamo Mbatha (Mirembe) were stars in their own right.It can't have been easy for them trying to carve out their own roles in a crowded pack of legends who appeared in CTA (1998). However they excelled in their roles giving C2A (2021) a fresh, yet nostalgic feel.I think over time C2A (2021) will gain the appreciation it deserves. Its not, nor will it be, C2A (1988). However, it did its job to remind us what good filmmaking looks like in today's crowded pack of superhero movies, sub-standard CGI flicks and lacklustre, heavily promoted movies.",Coming 2 America

It was corny in some places no doubt, but so are most comedian films, lets behonest and quite honestly a lot of other comedies get much higher ratings with much fewer laughs. People are roasting this movie and it's not warranted. I think it was a nice spin on the plot, it brought in much of the old plot but gave enough flash back for those who had never seen the first. I feel that after SOOO many years, they did a great job with it and I enjoyed it and so did my teenagers (who had seen the first one). My family loved it. Worth watching for sure.

I needn't have bothered, as this hastily-put-together sequel described the plot a few times even resorting to showing footage from the original to spoon-feed the new audience. I was hoping for a movie a little more sophisticated than its 33-year old predecessor but did not receive it. It was un-funny. I was pleased to see the return of original cast members, however I would describe Eddie Murphy's involvement in the project as a glorified cameo. Murphy did not write this either, which was evident when compared to the original.Sufficed to say that the only reason I watched the entire film was out of loyalty to the original - which, I shall never watch again either.Sigh.",Coming 2 America

But then it got old with the nutty professor series and norbet. Bringing the barber shop guys back was cool, but the rafiki wannabe was nasty. I couldn't even look at the screen when he was on. Some of the gags was overboard, like the farting lion. They should have kept it real. The first movie, that's what made it good. The scenes where Eddie showed his heart and kept things real. And that's the only good parts in this movie. The scenes between the son and barber without all the hoopla, the scenes between the kids, when Eddie and Lisa fight, when Eddie talks to his daughter at the end, the scene with his father n law mopping. Those where all heartfelt moments. As much as I adore James Earl Jones, his entire role was cheesy. All the dancing and special guest stars should have been edited to just a few minutes, it was too much. And the casting was wrong with the mom and the uncle. And we are too far in the future to try to get jokes about rape. Both the references in the barber shop to him being proud of being touchy in his past, to the rape of the prince were both gross and complete turn offs. They could have come up with another idea for the baby besides rape. Here's one, it was the 80s. The two guys had to live in the slums. How about the prince went to a sperm bank for cash. And the kid finds out by doing a dna test online. Much better than rape and stuff that actually happens today.
That is probably my biggest issue with the entire movie. That they create a son from rape, and then bring the mother back with them? And treat her like family in the end? If it would have been Lisa that was Cosby'd instead of the prince, that concept would never have gotten a green light.",Coming 2 America

What every house cat loves!"" Then they hold the products & shove it in the middle of the screen. & there were tons of ads like that. Maybe it's because it's produced by Amazon? & that's what Amazon does, sells merchandise. Puma, crown royal, Ciroc, Pepsi, McDonald's, bvlgari & countless others. They just said the name of the product, something good about it then shoved it mid screen. Lots & lots & Lots. It's pretty ridiculous.

Jordan - Black Panther hair, anyone?!) and acknowledging the less than 'flattering,' aspects of our past cultural norms.If you loved the first one & know it inside and out then this movie will likely delight you! If you don't, go back and watch the first one THEN watch this *immediately* after.Criticisms are relatively minor when dealing with a movie like this that you should start watching from the position knowing it's silly & not going to be groundbreaking, but if I have to pick some out; Wesley Snipes was meh, I don't think he made me lol more than once (satin gas) and I lol'd a lot... the new prince was ok... a gaping hole that I was sad was not filled was the ""F-U!!"" - ""F-U too!!"" exchange. An all time top classic comedy movie moment there (in my humble opinion). I was disappointed most of all though, by the women / girls playing such a sidecar supporting role when they were supposedly the future of the kingdom - some cultural 'norms,' from 30+ years ago persist.I'm sure I could go on and on, but that's the gist. I hope you go into it with some historical perspective and realizing this is not supposed to be the first movie, but instead an homage to it and to the nostalgia of that era. If you do I think you may find the joy in it that I did.",Coming 2 America

We live in another time now, so it is hard to expect the same feeling you got with part one. It was a different time then. Part 2 is really enjoyable. And one of the better sequals of a movie. With the nice cameo's and choreo and hints from other movies. And yes it is predictable most of the time, but still entertaining.
So i guess if you are a Eddy Murphy fan, you will really enjoy/appreciate it, he is more serious in the movie and left the jokes for the others. But omg also funny Wesley Snipes! I also really liked the movie because of the youth sentiment. But also to see al those actors come together again. Would it not have been corny if they used the same jokes of part 1? I guess some people just wanted 'that' because of the low ratings. I gave it an 8 because it deserves an average of a good 7.Please watch it, with your kids or family. Don't expect anything.

713,Hagar7,Should have left well enough alone,3,6 March 2021,"If you're going to take an iconic American comedy (to this day one of my favorites) and serve up a sequel that nobody asked for 30 years later, you'd better make it amazing. Coming 2 America wasn't even close.The writing was listless and uneven; it's clear that they expected nostalgia, Eddie, and Arsenio to do the work the writers wouldn't, to the extent that about five or six minutes of this movie is actually just footage from the original. But even returning to the My-T-Sharp (where we didn't spend enough time) and hanging out with the ever-messy Randy Watson wasn't able to save this.Starting off by playing what might have been a sexual assault for laughs, rolling right into the messy colorist dynamic from the original (the light-skinned woman is elegant, demure, and desirable, while the dark-skinned woman is trashy, sexually aggressive, and undesirable -- they've just swapped out Allison Dean's Patrice with Leslie Jones's Mary), and jumping into a half-baked plot that isn't helped by the fact that Akeem's newly discovered son Lavelle isn't as charming or well-developed as Akeem was. Also, the writers forgot that one reason the original worked was giving us a chance to laugh at America's craziness through an outsider's eyes. Seeing Zamunda and Nexdoria through familiar eyes doesn't work at all, partially because the writers never bother to develop those countries beyond a pile of African stereotypes (and they look even worse now in comparison to Wakanda). I also will never understand why they went the PG-13 route; the original was R and the difference is palpable.The solution to the male heir law is obvious within the first 15 minutes, and the way it's eventually handled is just frustrating; Akeem's amazing daughter gaining the throne only because her goof of a newfound brother abdicates doesn't feel right; it would have been a wack ending in 1995 and it's even worse in 2021. Some aspects of the script feel about 30 years old, and not in a good way. And after you spend nearly two hours plodding through this reboot, you'll feel every one of those 30 years. Just watch the original.",Coming 2 America

The cast have aged naturally like we have and had children etc. They can't re-do the hilarious and crude jokes of the first film, cause it's been done.

(the mansion actually belongs to rapper Rick Ross) the actress playing the eldest daughter was a great find, too. she was so beautiful and so sympathetically stoic. just loved her! all the great cameos, and unexpected music, which made some parts so righteously sexy, as black musical art often is. all in all a most pleasant evening of movie watching. i'm not much into comedies but this set a high bar for me. it's a great comedic counterpoint to the Black Panther! there's one great whoa cameo during the end credits. don't miss it!",Coming 2 America

763,cooldyl,Coming 2 America (for 10 minutes),4,7 March 2021,"To prepare for the highly anticipated sequel release I spent my Friday evening watching Coming to America, the original. A friend of mine cooked some amazing Fu Yung Hai which we enjoyed eating while watching the absolute 80s Eddie Murphy experience. He forgot part of the recipe and made a plate that could have easily fed 6 people instead of the four it was meant for, but it was delicious nonetheless.Owing to the COVID-19 lockdown we couldn't really finish the movie before our 9 P.M. curfew kicked in. But as we've all seen the original countless times before we knew how it ended and so we felt reasonably refreshed and confident going into the sequel.Flash forward to Saturday evening. The beginning of the film was quite promising. It was good to see most of the original cast reprise their roles over 30 years later. Quickly Eddie finds himself having to journey once again to Queens, NY. However, to much dismay, barely 10 minutes of runtime later he takes the plane home. This is when the movie falls apart.Slowly the viewer realizes that the rest of the movie is going to play out not just -not- in America, but also not with Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall as the lead players. Instead this movie turns into a vehicle for Jermaine Fowler and Leslie Jones, and it does not work.It is very much a shame, having to give this film a 4 out of 10. They had only one requirement that this movie should have covered: Eddie as an African King in the US.How in the lord did they fail to do that?",Coming 2 America

I saw comments like 'woke trash'. That means you just don't like 'the people' you see on the screen. Because it's not political at all. You're still just mad Trump lost.The other group- are just those who are overthinking it. Of course it's not gonna live up to the original. The original was magic. But this movie was fun. I was glad to have two hours of mindless entertainment, that didn't take itself too seriously. The jokes were funny. The cameos were funny. Leslie Jones had me crying. So did Wesley Snipes. Again, the movie was just fun.Instead of a broken imitation of the first, I found it to be more of a 30th anniversary 'TRIBUTE' to the first. Full of fantastic stand up comedians. Most of you need to chill out. I thought it was a wonderful 'welcome back' for comedic royalty.",Coming 2 America

Honestly, this is one of those films that despite your propensity to believe you can relate to everybody, every culture and everything...well...you can't. Now, for the Gen X'ers and yes, you Boomers who liked or even loved this movie, you know why: this film called back on nearly every scene or movement we loved throughout the years about the first film. We saw characters whom we laughed mightily with return, plays on different movements and scenes that were fan favorites and even got to laugh at the film poking fun at sequels and remakes while poking fun at itself being such. You could tell the actors had a ball making this film, especially Wesley. The end credits were filled with outtakes that were hilarious, including a dope a** call back to Ice Cream in Eddie Murphy's early famous stand up classics by the young man who played his son...again, if that outtake wasn't immediately recognizable to you and brought a huge grin to your face...it's okay, this movie simply wasn't made for you, don't be offended. Watch to the very last second of the end credits, and other classic line shows up. By the end of the last credit, we were emotional in our nostalgia, the call backs, the laughs, the characters, the shout-outs the vibing on the total absence of ""media-stereotypical"" Black family portrayal of dysfunction or assumed Black victim hood. Did this movie have to be made? Nope, but if you loved the first film when it first came out decades ago, you're going to love this one. Just don't watch it with someone who never saw the original when it came out or who just watched it for the first time recently, they will likely ruin the experience of this film for you because they will be so ""blah"" about it.",Coming 2 America

It is not an easy task to pick up on a production 30+ years later and make it entertaining and fun to watch. Call it joy to see the likes of Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall, James Earl Jones, and Shari Headley return to join the addition of Leslie Jones, Wesley Snipes, Jermaine Fowler, KiKi Layne, and Teyana Taylor. Sequels in today's society hardly stand a chance to their originals, however if you're able to watch with a fresh pair of eyes and perhaps as a stand-alone, you can enjoy one heck of a ride.

782,ol-11,Fairy-Tale-Sequel,6,14 March 2021,"This weekend I have seen this movie, and right before that also ""Coming to America"", which I have never seen before. After that, I was quite surprised to find out that there are many people, who like the first movie, but obviously hate the second one: Surprised, because both movies are quite similar in nearly every aspect, even though the sequel was made 33 years after the first movie. In my humble opinion, ""Coming to America"" is no masterpiece, but a quite entertaining movie. What most people doesn't seem to understand is that it is essentially a Fairy Tale, not unlike ""Cinderella"". This is also the sole justification for the flatness, the one-dimensionality of ALL the characters. I don't think they are supposed to be realistic, lifelike. It's the same in both movies, and also ""Coming 2 America"" has the Fairy-Tale-style. Part of this style is that the characters are somehow ageless. It is remarkable (and somehow enviable) how well the actors have aged. More important: Their character hasn't changed a bit, too.
Of course, there are a lot of ironic twists of this Fairy-Tale-style, but generally it is kept up from the beginning to the very end. I think it is just this combination of Fairy Tale and ironic twists which made the first movie so successful.
Basically, the same recipe was used for ""Coming 2 America"". In many aspects, this sequel reminds me of some of the Disney-sequels, like ""The little mermaid 2"" or ""Lady and the tramp 2"", where basically the plot from the first movie was reused, just for the next generation of characters. Quite unoriginal, but somehow and to a certain extend it worked. Of course, every element of surprise will be gone for such sequels. I guess this is also the main problem of ""Coming 2 America"": While it is - successfully! - reusing the recipe of the first movie, the result will and can not by as surprising as 33 years ago. What may be even more important is that the taste has changed meanwhile.",Coming 2 America

It is sad to see that not even with all the gold in the world, Hollywood is unable to do anything better than what it already did 40 years ago.

None of the charm, entertainment value or even plot of the first movie. For that matter, it has very little to do with the first film at all, aside from seeing hollow caricatures of the characters they created in the first movie.

This film had its ups and downs from the start and seemed rushed at times. The chemistry between Eddie and Arsenal is still there and what kept my attention was watching Eddie Murphy and Wesley Snipes on screen chemistry as well, something that I wished I saw in the 90's! Original casts members and characters was nice to see, but at times was pointless to the film! New cast members was a waste of time, they should of found a bigger star to play the son of King Akeem like Michael B Jordan, John David Washington, Daniel Kallua, etc would of made a better fit, way better than whoever that guy was! Lesie Jones once again was NOT FUNNY and her role was ridiculous and pointless the same goes for Tracy Morgan.

I didn't mind the celebrity appearances but some of them seemed out of place. I feel like instead of trying to make a great sequel they tried too hard to make a ""hit"". There were some moments though that brought you back to the original in quality and those moments are worth watching the movie for.

If this movie had been done 20 years ago and the plot focused around a younger cast, I think that the theme and plot line would have flowed much better.

The poor writing, casting (Wesley Snipes/Leslie Jones) and the over top acting along with boring dance scenes make this movie impossible to watch.I will admit, I did enjoy the visit to the barbershop. It was fun to see the old men (even though they somehow didn't age at all in 31 years). This by far is the highlight of the first 48 minutes of the movie. (I have to say ""48 minutes"" because this is as long as I could stick with it). Maybe it gets better in the last hour? Wouldn't know, because I couldn't force myself to stick with this major letdown of a remake any longer.Eddie.... you should have let this classic alone.

Totally don't get it and shocked this movie isn't loved more by fans of the original movie.",Coming 2 America
831,sbrooke1980,"Not great, not terrible, 6 stars for effort",6,10 March 2021,"I was SUPER excited to hear about this movie and wanted so bad to love it. I even got up at 3am to watch with my husband. I loved seeing all the characters brought back from main characters to smaller cameos like Paul Bates and Vanessa Bell. As a child of the 80s, Coming To America was one of my favorites and one of my first opportunities to revel in rated R debauchery with jokes that seemed written for my 11 year old mind as well as many that went right over my head until adult rewatches. I loved seeing Salt N Pepa & En Vogue here in the sequel and all the characters- young, old, new and returnees- are absolutely beautiful. Shari Headley has aged so beautifully I only wish I'd looked as good in my mid 20s as she does in her mid 50s and her acting as improved as well. Not to negate her acting in the original, Headley flourished the most in these 31 years in both appearance and ability. Eddie Murphy also barely aged at all and bringing back the My-T-Sharp group was a very positive use of screen time. I'm a fan of Leslie Jones & almost feel her storyline was a bit beneath her, but is nice to see her utilized in a movie of this scale. Jermaine Fowler is great here and brings the long lost son to life perfectly, but again, had less to work with than he was capable if regarding his storyline. The story was the main problem with Coming 2 America. I wondered how in the heck he could have a son he didn't know about and the story is just...dumb, for lack of a more accurate adjective. As much as I like Wesley Snipes, that whole storyline could have been dropped. How does he keep just dancing into a palace, THE palace, that's supposed to be protected by guards round the clock? How did he take the daughter hostage?? I hate to bring it up, but the way the son was conceived was poorly...conceived itself. If the genders were reversed and a man drugged and slept with a princess 30 years ago, somehow I doubt he'd be welcomed into the family with open arms and celebration. More likely he'd be arrested and jailed (and then set free on a ridiculously low bail if any at all, if we are being realistic, but our country's shady legal system is hardly the fault of the movie makers). They tried to make sexual assault funny, and it isn't and wasn't even in this context.
I thought the CGI was pretty good actually. Semmi in the club and them both at the apartment afterwards (despite what was occurring) LOOKED really pretty realistic. I had to convince my husband, who hasn't seen the original dozens of times as I have, that their apartment was different with no separate bedroom for Semmi or couch like the one Jones and Murphy ""hung out"" on, and this scene wasn't at all in the original in any small way.
It isn't that the movie ""shouldn't have been made"" or that it didn't need a sequel, or even that any negatives here tainted the original or its memory in the slightest. In fact it's a perfect contender for a sequel considering the ages and caliber of all the original main characters and those chosen for the first time in the sequel. It's just the way it was done, the storyline in general, was hugely lacking in any originality of its own and the best parts were throwbacks to the original movie. Maybe if this had been Rated R, though I understand why they needed to go PG-13 (I guess) because a lot of the new jokes just didn't go far enough like the first one did, and those that tried were not that funny, or missed the mark. It's worth the time to watch, but wasn't worth jumping up at 3am the day it was released to watch it. I actually turned it off a half hour before it ended and finished later out of near boredom, or if not boredom, more that it was totally predictable and I didn't feel like I even needed to see it play out as I knew exactly how it'd end and knew it wouldn't even be that entertaining.
Oh and Colin Jost's cameo was hilarious, and darn it if he's not just adorable, that kid. I can certainly see what Scarlett Johansen sees in him.The movie may be more of a 5, but the abundance of easter eggs/throwbacks and sheer amount of actors that returned and the newbies as well, that obviously put in the effort to bring these characters to life despite a script that lacked the original's flair and laugh out loud hilarity (""What does dumb f. k mean?""), it definitely warrants a 6-6.5. And I eagerly await the 3rd.",Coming 2 America

No, not all Eddie's film's have been great...but at least ""always"" watchable.
So, when I heard that there was a sequel coming 33 years later...I was nervous. I never expected a repeat masterpiece, but being a fan... I'd watch it anyway.
And so, I turned it on. Fell asleep 25 minutes into it! Turned it back on for replay. Fell asleep AGAIN. Finally, woke up and drank a bunch of coffee. Watched the entire movie. Dam, Damm, DAMM!!I know it's ONLY a movie, but you would have to be drunk OR on drugs to accept this movie ""plot"" after 30 yrs. and 5 years of rewrites from the Top Comedian In Hollywood! The script sucked. No directing or adult guidance. Just a lot of cameos and an unnecessary music sequences(that have nothing to do with the film) every 15-20 minutes. Honestly, this movie should have just been a music video, because that's how long it will keep your attention.The POSITIVE: The costume designs are outstanding, the barber shop guys are still kind of funny, Prince Akeems daughters are good, Wesley Snipes tried his best to save it, it's great to see all of the original cast alive and on screen together again.

Pretty basic plot with your cliche family/royal drama attached to it.I didn't appreciate the white man bashing in the film...found it extremely contrived and unnecessary and felt like that was included to please the African American community.Some parts of comedy were really forced...the only funny bits was when Eddie Murphy was on screen.Loved the dancing sequences, loved that in between the nonsense sometimes they would reel the movie in that reminds you of the original movie.
Loved the casting everyone was amazing.

841,BennyBunny03,"Ignore the ""it's woke"" reviews, though the sequel is still bad.",5,15 March 2021,"I would ignore the ""feminist agenda"" or the ""liberal propaganda"" reviews. They are ridiculous and untrue. The problem with the movie is that the time was spent on unnecessary entertainment and unfunny jokes rather than storytelling. Some character motivations are questionable. Plus, most of the significant plot points made zero sense. My three major problems:1. Akeem was raped, then blamed by his wife for getting Mary pregnant. After welcoming her to Zamunda, Akeem and Lisa treat Mary with luxury, like royalty and family. She raped Akeem, and everyone was cool with it. A bit sexist. Ok, movie. Again, how is this feeding into the feminist agenda? Couldn't Akeem and Mary have a drunken one-night stand after Lisa rejected him in the first film?2. It did not make sense that Meeka, Akeem's eldest daughter, would be raised to become Queen if that was never Akeem's intention. It would have been another story if the movie showed her potential and tried to have her prove to her father that she is worthy of the Queen title. What they should have done is have her provide level-headed counsel and perform regulatory duties. Instead, they filled her screen time fighting, which her sisters could do as well.3. Toward the end of the movie, Lavelle, Akeem's illegitimate son, ran back to America so he could live happily with Mirembe. After hearing his father's story, I was confused why he did not talk to his father first. In the first movie, Akeem confronted his father and told him he wanted to marry someone he loved and challenged his intellect. If the film emphasized that a prince and the potential king must have courage, bravery, and make sacrifices, why did they think it would be a good idea to have Lavelle run away like a coward?Was the movie entertaining, I guess? 1988's Coming to America was a well-balanced film; the jokes were in the dialogue, and the story was not neglected. The progression of events also went smoothly, and character behavior and development seemed natural. In comparison, Coming 2 America sacrificed narrative for product placement and entertainers. Lavelle barely had screen time with his sisters, but we as the audience are supposed to believe Meeka would help Lavelle, and he would miss her and his other two sisters and return to Zamunda. Yeah, no. If you want to turn your mind off for an hour and 48 minutes, you like the actors and appearances from Gladys Knight, Salt & Pepa, to Trevor Noah, and you can tolerate a rushed mess of a narrative, then the movie is for you.

I was pleasantly surprised and happy to be wrong when I assumed that it was going to suck. I'll be honest though, the only reason I watched it was because my wife wanted to...So there was a lot of anticipation for this ""Coming 2 America"" of course because we both liked the original so much right? My wife had been on me about watching this sequel (that's what it's considered I guess) for weeks so I finally caved--also, was free on Amazon Prime. Leading up to it I had done a little research about some comments Eddie Murphy has made in the past basically saying Hollywood is ""controlled by white men."" I became even more hesitant to finally watch the film. I knew I was going to be disappointed and frustrated. I knew there was going to be racist, woke subliminal or not dialogue/messages. And hey, there it was! ""don't use the white voice"" of course Eddie Murphy and everyone else who created this unfunny pile of trash had to add in the unnecessary political stuff. Oh, ""Obama united this country then the Nazis came in"" and other unnecessary bullsheep. They pretty much hit the woke narrative right on the head and drove it in deep.Oh, and did I forget to mention.... WAS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE A FUNNY MOVIE?!

Don't look too deep into it, it's a comedy with a positive message. This isn't Schindler's List so drop the bad reviews man. Check your anger elsewhere.
Frankly, this sequel delivered. On many levels.
Eddie Murphy brought back every living cast member and all our favorite characters plus some new crazy ones.
The music was pumping, it was culturally beautiful and the comedy was on point.
It's good, clean fun and some belly laughs.
My family all laughed throughout the movie and we loved every cameo.

It is not a serious movie so why would you think it would have a serious plot? Getting tired of seeing all these one star reviews for light hearted comedies, it's like users here compare them to the best movies they ever seen. Anyhow, there were three of us watching this film, none of us take ourselves that serious so we all enjoyed it, all in our 40s, with a sense of humour. It was entertaining, even enjoyed the music in it, maybe not everyones cup of tea, but there is always more than one flavour.",Coming 2 America
886,blonx,Not funny,3,16 March 2021,I watched about half and finally gave up. My only regret was that I started the movie at all. It has none of the charm of fun of the original. All the rap and dances felt horribly forced and misplaced.Highly not recommended.,Coming 2 America
887,sonofjorel316,Look at it as a continuation and not a sequel,6,5 March 2021,"I've seen a lot of negative reviews on here for this film and to be honest, It's getting to the point I can't take any reviews seriously on here.Here's my completely unbiased take not expecting for one minute to live up to the original.Is the film funny? - Yes in places it is. I wasn't laughing the whole way through but, there was more than enough laughs through out this film to keep me entertained. I have no idea what viewers that have allegedly seen the film were expecting? On top of that It's Rated 12 in the UK so, It was never going to have the language or some of the jokes that were present in the original film.For me, It was a nice little trip down memory lane. It was lovely to see how Akeem and Lisa were as King And Queen with Three kids in tow. In parts, Lisa handles being Queen a Lot better than Akeem does as King. Akeem is now a King, A Father, A Husband and Ruler of Zamunda and has a lot to juggle so for Akeem, a lot of the story has to do with rediscovering who he is.Shari Headley As Lisa looks even better with age and the chemistry she had with Murphy in the first film is still there.Whilst we end up in familiar territory with Coming2America (No Spoilers) If you take this as a continuation of the story of Akeem then you won't be disappointed. If you are looking for this film to surpass the original then I would advise not to bother watching.I just like to add the supporting cast of characters especially Wesley Snipes as General Izzi were more than fine and competent in their roles and the return of some old favourites and a few surprises add a little bit more to the happy factor when watching.Don't get me wrong, In the middle of the film, I didn't find myself laughing as much but, The last 20 minutes, redeemed the film for me.In closing, I don't think they ever set out to win any awards but the 1-3 star reviews it's been getting are rubbish. I've rated it a 6 because as I said, the middle of the film is a bit flat but, the beginning and end make that up for me.Just don't view it as a sequel, view it as a continuation to the original and you may be pleasantly surprised and, ignore any 1-3 stars reviews because they are fake.",Coming 2 America
888,enriquesinghjr,OK to watch once if you are a fan of the original,5,5 March 2021,"It feels like they put in some effort, but the end product was barely funny.The highlight of the film was the new barbershop scene.The rest felt just like they were going through the motions.Way too much screen time spent on the son (with no Eddie or Arsenio around).It was nice seeing some classic characters and actors back throughout the film.Worth watching at least once if you are a fan of of the original and already have Amazon Prime. DO NOT pay separately or go to a theater to watch, don't fall for it.",Coming 2 America
889,carlosramolete,I wanted to be generous,5,5 March 2021,"I gave it a five because they tried to at least bring talent in music and comedians, however, the script was very poor. They had a lot of recycled jokes. And, plot wise, not original at all.",Coming 2 America
890,wesley-j-lucas,Hilarious! Great nostalgic throwback film!,10,5 March 2021,"I had been looking forward to this movie ever since it was announced. I don't know why so many people are here giving it such a bad rating, this movie was absolutely hilarious and brought back practically EVERYONE from the first film, tied it to Trading Places, and added some new characters in the form of Tracy Morgan, Leslie Jones, and Wesley Snipes, who all added their own personal charm and hilarity to the film.My husband and I waited til he got home last night and watched it while we were getting ready for bed; we were dying of loud, raucous laughter the entire movie! Between the throwback jokes and casting and the modern additions of new characters, new music (and some appearances from the likes of En Vogue, Salt & Pepa, & Gladys Knight), and new storylines, we were laughing from beginning to end.For those who seem to have lost their sense of humor (especially when it comes to films with an almost all-black cast) might I suggest removing whatever stick is lodged inside your butt and try watching without prejudice.This is a film that celebrates black culture, black royalty, and even through comedy, addresses some of the issues facing modern black folks. And whoever did the costumes in this movie really deserves the Academy Award this year because they were all absolutely stunning and beautiful. It is most definitely the funniest film I've seen in years and the fact that it was already building on such a classic comedy, and managed to do so respectfully while building the story outwards even more in such a highly comedic way, was truly awesome. So many sequels made decades after the fact can be awful; this movie is absolutely not among that group, I'm glad to say! It respected the original while evolving into something more modern and honestly, I hope we get to see a third film now!For best results, be in a ready-to-laugh mode when you sit down to watch this and you, too, will find this to be a very funny, very meta, very modern film that absolutely celebrates and venerates its cast, its premise, and black culture.",Coming 2 America
891,speedy778200,Selfaware but not quite there.,5,6 March 2021,"I came into the film expecting to suck. Heck even the movie itself joked about how bad sequels are. I found it ironic, very selfaware at that point.The biggest issue with the film is the writing it feels nothing like the original too much in your face humor too much slapstick. It's more akin to the latest Ghostbusters scenario. It is definitely hard to write a sequel.What the film got right was the homage to the original cast. I was very much impressed with the patience and dedication to deliver that package.Let me discuss the original for a quick moment the jokes in the original were ""slap stick-ish"" but they had weight that carried the plot. Either tying to the character or acted as setup for a follow joke. Even Adam Sandler films have setups. His movies aren't great but they are a proven formula. The most important thing about comedy is acheiving silly yet cerebral. This movie completely missed the target.Why did it miss the target? It had some of the best comedic professionals ever! The beginning was probably the best written part and as it progressed just got muddied with weird out of place cartoonish characters and by the time it acheived any feelings it was too stupid to care about.Writing = Bad
Acting = Superb
Cinematography = Okay
Set Design = Great5.5 / 10",Coming 2 America

Not going to bother drawing comparisons to the original as its a sequel 3 decades plus later but come on?! So many unneeded call backs to the original we should know, PC nonsense for the sake of it, literally stealing half of Black Panther for I can only assume is lazy writing or drawing a super strange comparison and worst of all....just unfunny. Fleeting moments of humor interspersed but not a funny movie.I had limited expectations and as I mentioned you cannot recreate Murphy and Hall circa 80s on any level but, why try? I'd love to see them together again in something original as I'm sure it could be far better than this Hollywood cash grab, garbage. I feel so bad for a generation 100 years in the future when modern, ""talkies"" began less than a 100 years ago and we are seemingly out of ideas already.

The old film also did a good job in portraying Akeem as an intelligent and purpose-driven individual despite his naivety. Zamunda was also portrayed in a classy way, and Africa was given a fitting homage in Coming to America (1988).This sequel does not do the original any service. There are too many unnecessary characters, many dance routines some of which mock the African culture, the comedy is flat, and the CGI was just atrocious..... The only watchable scenes in this film were the barbershop scenes, so that tells you a lot.I love Eddie Murphy but overall this movie is very very very disappointing.

But from the moment soon-to-be King Akeem strides into frame, the movie is like a wonderful breath of fresh air. A wonderful love letter to Murphy's fans, his fellow actors, and his time and place in comedic and pop-cultural history.Almost no stone is left unturned in celebrating and remembering so many contributions to the first movie (and to his work in general), and it is a joy to see old friends again after so long. Everyone looks fantastic!!Zamunda is brought to life beautifully with lovely set design and even more gorgeous clothes; again, everyone looks amazing. The music is perfect, and it should be universal canon that all happy-ending movies must fade out to the joyful strains of ""We Are Family!""I was moved to tears of both laughter and poignancy, as Murphy's newfound maturity resonates in the lessons learned by king and son alike, full with the knowledge (and acknowledgment) of how much the world has changed in 30 years.

I don't want to get carried away, but it's hard to believe this actually got made.
The story is so forced and disjointed and doesn't know what it wants to be that it's uncomfortably frustrating trying to figure out just what the point in this movie is, because it certainly isn't to make you laugh.
Eddie Murphy is simply an empty shell of the comedy actor he was in the 80's, in fact, the whole cast are empty shells here; there's nothing behind their eyes except dollar signs... it's actually quite sickening to see them take advantage of their audience like that. I do get it, of course, it's easy money, and they'd be stupid not to take the gig, but at least put in some effort, ugh, why do I do this to myself?...
Anyway...there's zero spark in any of the characters, and nothing is really driving them. There's no chemistry between anybody in any scene (that we saw), it actually felt awkward to watch the whole time.
The actors are simply saying their lines like it's painful for them to speak, not one of them looks like they want to be there. Which brings me to the dialogue..... I'm not even sure I even want to go there because it's so cringe inducing. Nobody talks like that in real life.
Well, they've already made their money, and it's pretty clear that's the only thing anybody cared about while making this embarrassment to cinema.

I feel eddie murphy was a little flat in this one, but it may have been a byproduct of his character arc as a prince, turned king, who lost his way a bit along the way. I don't know what people expected, its really hard to recreate the magic that made the first movie a timeless classic. Even Metallica can't seem to compete with their earlier albums. Need I remind you part 1 was also cheesy, unrealistic, and full of one dimensional stereotypes. There are things about this that could have been better, sure, a bit more deep perhaps, but I enjoyed it, it was entertaining, had a few very funny moments, and a decent plot all in all. A bit rough around the edges, but a lot of comedies in this genre are. It was good to see the almost the whole cast back, that's rare in a sequel especially 30 years later.

Now, he's stuffy like his father. As for the plot, it felt forced, like it was necessary to do the right thing and make his daughter heir to the throne, even though very little screen time was given to develop her character.

The actor who played the son was not great. The wigs screamed ""Tyler Perry"". There was double standards and a feminist agenda.

It's not like he is even that important in the movie.No real comedy is displayed here other than some more than boring references to 'black culture'. Endless name dropping from the hip hop scene plus some silly dance acts that seem to have no real place in the story.On the positive side. If you liked the first movie you may enjoy some references to that movie including some actual footage. Even Babar is back! But the story is flat with no real twists and the dialouge will not win any oscars.James Earl Jones as the elderly King is a more beliavable character and feels real and down to earth.Footnote: The use of fake African countries in movies must come to an end. That also goes for fake eastern European countries. It's like US film makers thinks that people live in a Disney bubble with no real knowledge about the world.,Coming 2 America

I watched this movie with my family and we all agreed at Leslie Jones was really good but did a little too much. We also agreed that they packed WAY too much into this movie and there were some plot holes. Ex. one second Izzi (Snipes) is fighting with the daughters, the next second he and Akeem are friends? Same thing with Jones and whatever the wife's name is. And you also see her saying that he's never there for their daughters, YET she hasn't been seen in NOT ONE scene with them. The other reason why is that this 'love story' was predictable from the start. Great acting on the sons part though. I know I'm jumping around a little bit here, but they never said why Akeem had 'changed' and didn't change the laws that women couldn't own businesses. It's been 30 years, how did NOBODY bring this up to him? I'm sure that would've been the first thing that he abolished when he became king.

Unfunny black-only flicks were as distinguishable from funny black-only flicks (like this film's prequel) because one was forced and arrogant the other one hilarious and original.In this way Eddie Murphy is like iron Maiden.

I wasn't. 33 years later 'Coming 2 America' proved to be quite enjoyable! Using some similar plot pieces and an ensemble that obviously was having a good time during filming they put together a movie that is both light-heartedly silly and just overall fun to watch. Sure, the plot is formulaic but: How good is it to see Wesley Snipes indulge in his role as General Izzi? The over the top spectacle with just the right amount of irony? I had a few good laughs and a smile on my face when the credits were done. And I think this is exactly what they set out to achieve: some easy, silly light-hearted fun.

The storyline was lackluster at best. Bringing back the barbershop quartet (who must be 120 years old by now) was laughable in the worst way. I'm honestly surprised they didn't CGI Don Ameche & Ralph Bellamy to round out the idiocy...

1084,kenstu,Coming or returning to America?,5,14 March 2021,"Notice: This review contains spoilers. If you haven't watched this movie yet, do not read any further. There's also no judgment to anyone that did or didn't like it.""American cinema is the best is blasphemy. Superheroes, remakes, and sequels to old movies that no one asks for. If it's so good, why ruin it?"" Lavelle Junson.Given the increased number of streaming services being launched, one can argue ""what better way to generate revenue (as a return investment) to create sequels to an established franchise or universe?"" This, in it of itself can be tricky as original characters and settings are sacred, as they're the foundation upon which new characters and settings will be built. If properly executed with meaningful stories to follow, the existing world will expand as new characters are developed and audiences (old and new) will be engaged and want more.In the 33 years since the movie ""Coming to America"" was released, there have been discussions of a sequel in the wake of its success. It wasn't until recently that an announcement for a sequel was in progress, and that much of the original cast would return. In the movie ""Coming 2 America,"" seeing the original characters brings back nostalgia from the previous movie as they've all aged well.The creators honor the world that was previously built in terms of royalty and strength as new characters are introduced to carry the torch beyond the boundaries hitherto established. The following is a notated review of some unfortunate, yet legitimate criticisms that are a result of the movie's mixed reviews and low rating.To begin, the title ""Coming 2 America"" is confusing. It feels like one is reading a text message from a sender that was too lazy to spell the word ""to."" A common question would be ""does one have to spell it out for you,"" yet in isolation, the title doesn't differentiate from the original title ""Coming to America."" The original characters are returning to America; suffice it to say the title is contradictory to the story being told.An argument can be made that two stories are being told. An example of this is Zamunda being on the brink of war despite the character Akeem's refusal to marry a tribal warlord's sister who was selected to be his bride in the original. In addition, there's Akeem having an illegitimate son. The onscreen evidence suggests that he had a one-night stand with Mary Junson upon arriving in Queens thirty-three years prior. What's implausible about this is that of the many resources Akeem has access to, he doesn't demand a paternity test?It can be argued that any woman could've declared him to be the father of her child without gathering paternal evidence to the contrary. Nevertheless, the looming tension of Zamunda's neighboring country and the revelation of Akeem having a probable heir to his throne caused him to immediately act, therefore leaving the audience to question exactly what is this movie about? Did the so-called fortune teller not see this thirty-three years ago?Another disappointing scene was the Celebration of King Jaffe. This feels like the equivalent of a Super Bowl half-time show with multiple renowned celebrities. As they're great to see on stage, it takes away from vigor of the ritual performances, albeit the audience can see what the creators are aiming for. It inevitably proves to be overkill for King Jaffe's farewell ceremony that ends with him passing away while standing upright in his casket.Furthermore, the comedy felt like it was forced. With a PG-13 rating, the preacher and the barbers (all of whom arguably should've been aged) were far cries from how they were in the original film. It appeared as though the characters knew the humor was being watered down and they did their best to execute it, but to no avail. An example is the quarrel between Semmi and Uncle Reem. As they gave it their all, the back and forth scenes are forgettable as they served as bastions of support to Akeem and Laville.Speaking of Laville, the movie focuses more on him than it does Akeem. Some of the scenes were entertaining, yet they soon become a struggle to get through. One scene that was cringing to watch was the public circumcision. Yes, it was a prank, but it's obvious at this point that the writers are trying too hard. To highlight the lackluster storytelling in this movie, Laville goes as far to say the idea that ""America Cinema is the best is blasphemy. Superheroes, sequels and remakes to old movies that no one asks for. If it's so good, why ruin it?""It's unknown whether pointing such out is meant to create a lifeline for this movie. Nevertheless, it does not and the scenes become almost identical to those from the original film as the movie progresses. An example is Laville having to choose a wife. This was seen in the previous film, and it doesn't do anything to raise the tension.In addition, the Zamunda tradition was broken before; hence Akeem marrying Lisa. What serves as a major turnoff is Lisa pulling the rug from beneath Akeem for him to see that he was pushing Meeka (his eldest daughter and rightful heir) aside for Laville. This is an example of how Akeem isn't the dominant figure he was in the original film. He wasn't pressured into doing anything as his will to get what he wanted was strong.It's understood that the tradition is what it is. Why is it now sacrilegious to break? When it comes to the subject of Akeem, Laville, and Meeka, they're fighting separate battles that once again leaves the audience questioning what exactly is this movie about? Having been sidelined for much of the movie, Meeka's character is elevated in the fight scene against General Izzi's henchmen. She undoubtedly proves that she's the rightful heir to the throne, and Laville decides to serve as an ambassador to Zamunda in the end with his groomer (who he barely knew), which makes the plot for this movie convoluted and difficult to award a high rating.What would have been a nice touch was to have the movie titled ""Returning to America,"" as Meeka is sent off to college by Akeem and Lisa to pursue her study in International Relations and Affairs at NYU. After completing her first year, Meeka is summoned by her Aunt Patrice (Lisa's sister) to help her in running the complex where Akeem and Semmi lived in the original movie. The landlord has aged and can no longer afford the upkeep of the building. Semmi previously left him a small fortune in the original film. Patrice rents out the McDowell estate while living in the unit that Semmi had renovated. She helps the landlord renovate the building which exhausts the fortune, leaving hardly any money to afford the taxes. Meeka's talents and her global connections enable her to help Patrice negotiate a loan to pay the taxes under the Jaffe name. Akeem and Lisa learn about this, as well as Meeka dropping out of school and are furious. Akeem, Lisa, their two daughters, and Semmi go to New York to confront Meeka. Upon arriving, they track Meeka down, and see that she's about to be mugged. Akeem orders his bodyguards to stand down as Omma and Tinashe run to her aid and the three send the muggers away limping. Surprised to see her family, Meeka begins explaining herself. Unbeknownst to her is that Akeem and Lisa knew that she was helping Patrice. She made Meeka promise not to tell anyone because she didn't want to ask them for any money. Akeem turns responsibility of the building over to Semmi, and Omma and Tinashe sweettalk him into opening up a dojo. Before long, the original supporting cast begins to reunite. Samuel L. Jackson reprises his role as the Hold-Up-Man, as Akeem and Semmi stand ready to take him on. Samuel laughs and says ""relax fellas, I'm not here for that. I've had time to reflect on the bad things I did, and I want to thank you for knocking me on my ass that day,"" Astonished, Akeem and Semmi shake his hand, and Samuel hands them a business card to his private security company called Kick-Ass Security. Akeem and Lisa tell Patrice she's family and that they'll help her with whatever she needs. While they're at it, they help clean up the neighborhood, including the Might T Shop where the barbers' grandkids have inherited the business. They also tell Meeka that if she chooses not to go back to school, they will support her while she chases her endeavors. Meeka (like Patrice) didn't want to rely on her parents, so she decides to go back to school and graduates with honors. Akeem and Lisa have a royal celebration back in Zamunda, while Cleo McDowell and Maurice (the general manager of McDowell's since he was banned from cooking) walks alongside King Jaffe in his wheelchair. He makes eye contact with Akeem and nods in approval and admiration before saying ""your mother would be so proud"" while staring at her portrait before the screen fades to black.This is how you honor the past while building the future. To reiterate, if a sequel is properly executed with a meaningful story to follow, the existing world will expand as new characters are developed and audiences will be engaged while wanting more. In isolation, ""Coming 2 America"" serves as a good stand-alone movie that falls short as a continuation to the original.",Coming 2 America

It is stuffed so tightly full of references to details in the first film that you could spend the entire duration spotting them and still come out of it feeling like you had a good time.
A previous reviewer asked ""Am I the only one that feels that these money grabs take a little bit of magic away from the originals?"" and while I can see how someone could feel that, it wasn't my experience; it seemed to be more a celebration of the first than anything else.
This is not a sequel in the same way that Godfather 2 was a sequel, it's just a joyful answer to the question ""I wonder how they're all getting on in Zamunda?""
Would it stand up on its own? I think it probably would; there's enough plot and silliness to keep you entertained even if you didn't see the first one - you'll just be missing out.

He bucked tradition for true love, and he loved the woman that knew herself and her worth.

Even a repetition of the narrative strand of the first would have been better, namely the winning duo Eddie-Arsenio (not at all exploited here even if there are both) who tries to find Akeem's son in America but no, they find him in 5 minutes to then bring him without too much difficulty into the kingdom of Zamunda and the rest of the film has this ""bastar* son"" (line repeated several times ad nauseam) as the main character! What to say, it's the first time I see Jermaine Fowler acting (I'm from Italy and here he's not so famous) I know he's a comedian maybe a good one but didn't have the opportunity to see his comedic talent in this movie and to be honest I would have preferred seeing Murphy most! In conclusion flimsy storyline, lots of random dances and songs, a flood of under-exploited characters (there's also Eddie's daughter, Bella Murphy, here making her debut as Akeem's daughter and playing a couple of lines at most). The only good thing is to see again almost all the old cast and some old characters played by Eddie and Arsenio but (sad to say) both uninspired and not really funny so this reunion can't save alone the whole movie which is a total disappointment.",Coming 2 America
1112,Kentrowston,Disappointment is king!,2,5 March 2021,"Just watched this attempt at a movie, very unhappy with it.
If you are expecting any of the quality in the first movie, then you are going to be in a world of hell watching this.
Recycling the story from Part 1 and switching Murphy into the father role, it's like a tedious, annoying journey.I felt like I was slowly laying an egg for 100 minutes.
Dumb nods to today's popular culture are thrown in all the time, and it is offensive.
All of the old characters return for this, and all of them have nothing entertaining to offer.One of the most tragic moments is when two characters are talking, they actually talk about how movie sequels are a risky idea.
I almost expected that they were about to turn to the camera and break the 4th wall!
Characters breaking the 4th wall was played out after the 80's ... it has to be outlawed in Hollywood.Eddie and Arsenio are just *blaaaghhhh* in this. Nothing good.
The last 10 minutes is like a medley of all the characters, singing, dancing, and it makes you feel so bad.The bloopers shown in the end credits make me wonder if they finished shooting the movie and then said, ""Ok let's film the bloopers now."" (Simpsons joke, if I remember correctly)I suspect this discussion occurred between the writer of the movie and the producers:Writer: It's ... well, it's just difficult for me to craft a story that goes into new territory.
Producer: I understand, but look at how the word 'To' in 'Coming To America' can be changed to a ""2"", thus denoting that it is the sequel.

The first third provides a nostalgic return of many characters from the original which admittedly brought a few smiles and then goes downhill as soon as the truly atrocious Wesley Snipes is introduced. A real problem is that the ""coming to America"" part is so short lived. That's what made the original funny; the fish out of water tale. The story line involving a genXer going to Africa to wonder in a CGI backdrop world was neither interesting or funny. There would have been so many more options of a buddy movie storyline for Murphy and Hall to shine in but they went with a large portion of the film ignoring the multitude of talent from the original and having a romance between two characters nobody cares about. They could have just done a 90 minute movie based at the barber shop in Queens and it would have been more entertaining.

I've got to say, the story that they were going for here has potential, but I think they got lost somewhere in the middle and the plot feels to advance somewhat unnaturally. On top of this, some characters felt a little forced and just weren't needed which could have allowed more time for nostalgia trips. Having said that, I very much enjoyed the start and I feel the ending was a really great celebration of the film and cast and ultimately just felt like everyone was having a fun time which made me have fun too. Its definitely not the perfect film, but it has some great nostalgia, brings back some fantastic characters, I was definitely laughing and at the end of it and I think the actors did a really good job.So, definitely not as good as the first, but it's a fun, easy watching film which has some good laughs and really celebrates the original and its cast.",Coming 2 America

But not once is the horrendousness of the situation addressed. It's either played for laughs or Akeem is treated like the bad guy in the situation.Even worse, his abuser is treated like some sort of bad-ass no nonsense woman who we're clearly meant to find hilarious. His wife even befriends her!So we have a male victim set up just to be mocked or villainised, just to make way for yet another girl power plot, identical to pretty much every other movie of the last decade or so.I tried very much to like this movie, despite its flaws, but this central premise just left my skin crawling the whole way through.

The whole time I was watching I couldn't imagine it being any worse than it was. I can't imagine anyone who was a fan of the first one to actually enjoy this mess.

1132,Vectrexer,"I love Cheese and Music but, AVOID THIS MOVIE!",1,16 March 2021,"Coming 2 America is a want of time. This movie is too aware of itself and too full of itself. A shallow script that feels like a project of some celebrity fangirl/fanboy that has worked in writing screenplays maybe once of twice before, and is being forced to write to the ego of the performers instead of the spirit of the characters and the movie. This results in the entire movie feeling forced. As if nearly everything in the movie, including the singers, is a series of paid shorts loosely strung together. Such a waste of talent. Even worse, a waster of the viewers' time and money. I'll sum it all up with three words. AVOID THIS MOVIE!",Coming 2 America

This was a throwback; a nod to times before when people could make jokes and if people didn't like them, they moved on rather than take offence at everything. The first scene in the barber shop was an example of that.It's a comedy and despite the jokes being a bit predictable, like the bathing scene, it's still funny. When you go to see a band in concert you expect them to play songs you know so what's the difference with watching an actor/film doing jokes you expected.Too many people have slated this film but for me, the nostalgia is good enough to make me enjoy it.

I do believe there should've been a different reason for him going back to America. The fact that he had met someone on the first one and got them pregnant just didn't work for me.

I had high hopes this might be quite funny and good. Then the trailer came out and for some reason I just had a bad feeling it wasn't going to be as good as the first film. It just didn't look like it was going to be as good.
Having now watched it, I have to say... it was absolutely awful "" :( The storyline was bad, the acting didn't come as natural as in the first film and it was more like a parody version. It was like watching dumb and dumber 2"". The first dumb and dumber was hilarious and the acting came natural, then the second film everything came across too forced and not funny and again a bad story line. This was exactly what coming 2 America 2 is like. I think I laughed only once throughout this whole film. In many parts it was boring and I felt like switching it off too. Everything about it was just bad. I wish they had never made it. Sometimes things are just best left alone when the first films are so good and that's what makes them special.

Imagine a fictional european country where they wear scottish kilts, talk english with french/german accents, while doing russian dances and you get the kind of world building they use, the kind used in black panther. Seemed like a chance to just give his famous friends money (someone tell them africans like to mosh to system of a down too). The whole lot could have been cut.The second 3rd is the plotline not involving Eddie, its a basic love story plot, really basic. You figure it in 2 seconds. This plot has very few jokes and basically could have been cut.The rest of the film gets close to being funny, and it has its moments. I dont think eddie has lost it, just every time youre about to laugh properly, they cut away to the two other parts of the film.Could have been great.",Coming 2 America

Just like the first one, this movie is about the relationships, both between family members and the romantic relationships. I would have liked to have seen Louis Anderson spill another milkshake and talk about fries, but it really puts a smile on your face seeing all the old characters show up.

This sequel pales in comparison. The original showed a beautiful love story with plenty of comedy, this sequel is essentially the Princess Diaries with sexist undertones. There were also a few racist jokes about Asians thrown around. The movie wants you to root for an idiot from America rather than on the princess who trained for the role of queen her whole life, then we're supposed to be grateful when the King changes his mind and does the exact thing he was supposed to do from the beginning?

It is not as good as the original, but I would say that this was a great amount of fun! I introduced my 12 and 8 year old kids to the original before seeing this one and while you may say that they are much too young to watch some of the material, my live for movies started by adults introducing me to great comedies like this one and they really liked this movie, too.

Eddie Murphy did AMAZING as the barber but did nothing as akeem. He was lifeless and not funny at all. Everything felt forced. I don't mind music with films like this but putting in ""pop"" music to make it appealing to the new generation just didn't work at all.

In the past decade I've been witnessing movies where the corporate greed seeps in more and more without even hiding it, depriving them of all the character, charm and uniqueness that makes the medium great. Remakes, reboots, unnecessary sequels and thousands of comic book movies are the norm, written by talentless third-rate writers and made for a modern audience that grew up watching idiotic and mindless drivel on YouTube.

There was only a few scenes in America, maybe a quarter of the movie max, but it was fun seeing the barbershop again.I'm not a fan of the idea that he was ""drugged"" by weed, bc that's not how that works, and the idea of the girl basically raping Eddie while he's so stoned. Like, weed is probably one of the few drugs that wouldn't happen with, you can't get so high that you can't say no and forget all about having sex.

The film is very enjoyable. The plot is perfect for a sequel. The film has great nods to the original, and I think it says a lot of the film production and the reception of the original, that every single (alive) cast member makes a return (and the ones who sadly couldn't are spoke of with fondness). The film has so much energy it's almost like a celebration. The music is sublime, I was dancing along. And it was remarkable to see Murphy and Hall jump back into those character perfectly after 30 years! And the new addition of Wesley Snipes returning to a major picture was great too!If you go in with the right attitude this film is the much needed celebration and light hearted entertainment that I certainly needed. Sure. If you compare it to the original you may be a little disappointed, but I'd suggest if you compare the original to the Ghostbusters or The Godfather you will also be disappointed.It was great to see Prince Akeem bringing Zamunda to the 21st century, as it was great seeing this classic comedy being brought into the 21st century too.

To no surprise, a huge disappointment. Like so many other comedic sequels, such as Caddy Shack 2 and Fletch 2, the second is never as good as the first.I may be speaking from a biased perspective as I believe, like so many others, Coming to America is one of the Classics. The writer is also a firm believer that Classics are not meant to have sequels thirty-three years later.This Coming to America 2 is nothing short of a tragedy to the tenth degree. The story plot remained the same, Akeem's male servant and flower peddlers
have all aged performing the same duties and work functions. C'mon!There were Cameo appearances from the likes of Gladys Knight, Salt and
Peppa, Morgan Freeman to Mutombo. The three wise men from My T Sharp Barbershop haven't aged in 33yrs. Are you kidding me???The script lacked depth, the story did not flow and the content was extremely predictable infused with memorable lines and flash backs from the first movie. I'm assuming that was the Writer's attempt to include funny in a comedy in hopes of keeping the audience from boycotting Netflix for green lighting this atrocity.Every black comedian had a guess spot, from Tracey Morgan to Trevor Noah. I
was waiting to see Sindad or Rerun from what's happening. Ridiculous!!!It was very difficult to decipher if Wesley Snipes' character was portraying a Drum
Major or Step master. I expect more from one of my favorite Actors.Other than one, maybe two, or three original laughs, the funniest part of Coming to America 2, was the fact it was even made. It is great knowing that Coming to America stands on its on, and those of us who love that movie will continue to watch it when ever possible.Coming to America fans like me, will also actively promote to friends and family to never speak the words of Coming to America 2, ever, ever, ever, ever again, let alone watch it.",Coming 2 America

Coming 2 America is poor with screenplay script dialogues humor and fun, now when I am writing I will always compare with the original and write my review.

Back to this movie.I really wanted to like this movie. I loved the original and the original cast. I wanted this to be at least good. But inside, I knew it was going to be flat. And I was right.

It carries some of the same DNA as the first film, brings back some characters I didn't expect to see and has a genuine message at the end of the film but overall there was alot missing from it, including laughter.Watch for nostalgic purposes, don't expect too many laughs",Coming 2 America

I can not possibly get across how bad it is, not even a single smile was raised. Lazy writing and film making. The cost of getting this cast of actors will never get recovered, I honestly believe the entire cast were embarrassed to be associated with this when they saw the outcome...

Could have benefited from more adult humor, vulgarity, and ethnic stereotype humor. But I understand, it's #CurrentYear. The virtue signal plot point of ""why can't I be Queen?"" was completely unnecessary. Not everything needs to have a political or cultural virtue signal. Plenty of that going on. Doesn't have to be included in everything. Character development seemed rushed compared to the first.Considering all of those negatives, still pretty entertaining. Loves seeing some of the old faces. Cast was great. Eddie & Arsenio are still the African Connection after 30 years. Wesley Snipes doesn't get enough credit for being a comedic actor. Actions movies mask his comedy acting. If you're a fan of the first it's a great nostalgic comedy. But not nearly as revolutionary and filled with one liners as the first.",Coming 2 America

Eddie definitely SQUEEZED every bit of part 1 into part 2. I mean, If you are still alive and were in the 1st movie , I'm sure they found a way to fit you in. It definitely lost its magic and was no where near as good as part 1. It's one of those special movies that should have been left alone. It was great to see old faces , great wardrobe and old characters but just wasn't enough. Wasn't a fan of the political undertones. Was not necessary given these crazy times.

Nevertheless, I gave it a chance with fresh eyes and a little biasness. The scenery felt and looked..staged. The concept appeared to look through the eyes of an OG looking at the newer generation instead of having concept exploring from a fresh pair of eyes. The movie started out very slow and almost unwatchable. However, it did pick up as the movie went on. Parts were laughable beyond mid-way. Comedy at times wasn't as fluid and fresh. Aspects of the movie were predictable. Some characters were a little over the top. Yet some still provided comedic relief. Plot was quite thin.",Coming 2 America

This sequel picked up 30 years later, keeping in truth of the characters and actors, brought in fun cameos and new believable characters (keeping in tune with the culture of the 1st movie). Past and present are effectively intertwined and the tongue in cheek moments blended in. This movie is Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall, fun, not taking themselves too seriously and allowing Tracy Morgan and Wesley Snipes and Leslie Jones to join in the kingdom of Zamunda.

1280,captainrachel,Stick with it !! The second half is MUCH better than the first !!!,8,1 July 2021,"Let me preface this by saying I am a diehard fan of the first film. I know it by heart and have seen it a million times. My stomach sank when I found out they were making a second part, because, as we all know, part twos tend to suck.The first half of the film was as bad as I expected it to be. The story line is... forgivable... I mean, they had to weave SOMETHING together in order to set up the movie. The jokes felt like they were pitched by fired SNL writers. The much awaited barber shop scene was saturated with political, current event-type jokes. (Ugh!) And they leaned on so many black stereotypes, it bordered on offensive.However, I muscled through it. As the movie unfolds, you get kinda taken in by it. Your standards drop a little, and you let your guard down. The fierce loyalty I have for the first movie relaxed it's grip... and I let myself enjoy it. And I don't regret it !Sometimes, sequels serve as way to check in on some our favorite characters, to see how they're doing, and what they've been up to. That's exactly what Coming 2 America allowed me: a chance to hang out with good memories and old friends. By the end of the film, I had teared up twice. And the closing number saw me clapping and crying happy tears.So, if you can forgive the unnecessary musical artists, the product placement, the shaky story line, tired stereotypes, and a few bad jokes.... stick with it, and enjoy an all-expenses-paid trip back to Zamunda!",Coming 2 America

I didn't expect much but was still very disappointed. To those saying ""it's not meant to be tarentino it's suppose to be fun"" what exactly is that suppose to mean? A comedy can be just as good and well made as any other genre, the first film achieved exactly this. Bad filmmaking isn't forgivable all of a sudden because it's a comedy and I'm not sure exactly what is ""fun"" about bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, and bad editing. It just made me want to pull my hair out even 5 minutes in. To those saying it was made this was to ""bring it to the new generation"" lol what?

I laughed all the way through, I pretty much ignored the storyline and listened to all the jokes.They didn't really need to make another film, but it was nice seeing all the characters older, and I think it was awesome how they managed to bring back some of the minor characters in this movie which you don't see that often",Coming 2 America

1298,jbarrientes-41680,TIME CHANGES AS WELL AS PEOPLE,6,5 March 2021,"I'm seeing a lot of low ratings for this movie ranging from 4's & 5's to even some 1's and I think I know why that is it seems many people are going into this movie expecting it to be a pure outlandish with memorable character/personalities an a story like the last one and that's just the problem, if your judging this one by the first one then don't even bother watching it.That was 1988, Eddie Murphy is at a different point in his life no longer that brazen, raw, NC-17 comedian that he was at the time so therefore it's only logical that this film would be different. DON'T go into this movie expecting that type of comedic film because your just gonna be disappointed and a movie like that like the previous in an of itself would be a tough act to follow. We're we all wanting that? Yes. Myself included.Having said all of that judging it at face value; it's not a bad movie IMO sure it's more family oriented and tamed overall but I honestly wasn't offended by that since I found there to be a nice rounded mix of old and new characters with much care & personality fleshed into them as well as the story I thought the actors did a believable job playing it I even was surprised that there was actually some tears being shed in the dramatic scenes abd the comedy like I said it serves second to the story and while yes it tamed PG-13ish I laugh maybe not out loud hardcore rolling on the floor but certainly audible, an still found myself smiling and chuckling muchFlaws? I wish the backstory of main villain and the girlfriend were a bit more fleshed out the main villain's character, and his evil agenda as well as the girlfriend of our leading actor. I was hoping her backstory was a bit more detailed since a good chunk of the plot revolves around her. Also I wish her & the rest of Akim's kids had more involvement in dialogue and attention. Lastly from the time the first one ended to now I wish I would've know about what happens during the 33 year span from the first one nothing too much but a little history and details here and there between the main characters and zemunda.Overall this movie felt like more of a stand alone than a sequel and I actually thoroughly enjoyed it. Not as memorable but a good film to watch with the family if you just wanna have some laughs and a lighthearted story. (:",Coming 2 America

Bowfinger, Beverly Hills Cop, Trading Places, 48 Hours and Coming To America are allebdlessly rewatchable. I even have a big soft spot for The Golden Child.However, this film is something else. Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall look embarrassed in a number of scenes. There are a few scenes in which Eddie Murphy looks as though he is forcing himself to look happy. Have you ever seen a miserable person trying to look politely social? It looks like that.The plot is terribly cynical, and there is no chemistry between any of the performers. So many scenes are completely dead that it makes you wonder why they kept on making the film.I lasted almost an hour and then gave up.

It's really rare that the sequel is just as good or better than the first. My 8 year old daughter enjoyed it with its modern flair but I didn't feel like the acting was as sincere as it was before. I missed the ""Soul Glow"" and the rawness that the first movie had. We all know that Madge Sinclair passed away in the 90s but there wasn't any talk about it; it was more like an understood kind of thing.

With the being said, don't expect the same raunchiness we all got in the original.2) NOTHING is ever as good is it's predecessor, so if you came out swinging comparing it to the original, again setting yourself up for failure.SPOILER ALERT: All of the original characters are back, portrayed by Murphy and Hall.

Not as bad as many of these reviews suggest, but still pretty bad. It mainly feels uninspired and, frankly, unnecessary.Murphy is fine, but can no longer convey Prince Akeem's warmth, intelligence, and strength. Headley, sadly, isn't given much to do. And Jermaine Fowler's Lavelle simply isn't compelling enough to carry the picture.Still, it's a watchable bad. Although I didn't laugh much, it was nice to spend time with these characters again. It certainly wasn't as painful to sit through as Tom & Jerry, for example.Speaking of that film, Colin Jost mainly redeems himself from his disastrous showing there, providing a brief, uncomfortable callback to the Dukes.",Coming 2 America

When people ask me what my favorite movie is, it's always ""Coming to America"" and that in it's self is an amazing accomplishment, which means that this sequel was set up to fail.

Love the music, performances, action scenes, how they brought back the characters (32 years later) in a tasteful way, costumes, beautiful black People and cast. Plot made sense, comedy was good.

When I heard they were making a sequel I was worried it wouldn't live up to the original but when I saw the trailer I thought, ""that actually doesn't look terrible."" So I went into it not expecting too much and I absolutely loved it. The plot is quite predictable but it's a comedy not a psychological thriller. It's basically the reverse of the original. The original cast are great and the callbacks are great. The fact they get so many characters to return is actually amazing. When those two rapping twins showed up I almost lost my mind. People getting upset about the strong female character thing need to chill out. It's not forced down your throat. You're introduced to the three daughter characters as they one by one spar with their father which itself is a reminder of Prince Akeems skills with a staff from the original film. This scene immediately gives you an idea of what each of the princess's are like and the ambition of the eldest daughter who (spoiler alert) defeats Wesley Snipes' warlord later in the same fashion as Prince Akeem took down Samual L Jackson's would be robber. Overall this is just a fun film filled with nostalgia and a lot of laughs.

That is what made the character interactions so amusing to watch.Now you are stuck with such a garbage plot that honestly makes no sense.

1408,TigerTamer,Not perfect but a fun nostalgia trip,7,5 March 2021,"I'm seeing lots of negative reviews, don't let others sour your own experience. I found it to be a solid enough sequel story with some funny callbacks and enough enjoyable moments of its own. It's worth seeing just to revisit the old cast and characters. Eddie and Arsenio have still got it, and it's supported by some great performances from the original and new cast, especially Wesley Snipes, who clearly loved flexing his comedy chops here, with that despotic charisma he gave us back in Demolition Man.I was wondering how woke they'd take this sequel, understandably some people could find the first movie to be problematic 33yrs later, (mostly the gender inequality and outdated African stereotypes) but the sequel does a good job of keeping enough of the same humour for modern audiences. The CGI animals were not good, at all, and tbh it probably could be 10-15 minutes shorter, but I enjoyed it, and you might too. 7/10",Coming 2 America

It's wasn't awful but not very funny either. The worst thing about it was that for a film whose ultimate message seemed to be that women are equally as good as men, and shouldn't be overruled by the latter, pretty much all of the film was given over to the male characters and the female parts were just window dressing. Both the royal wives who were strong characters in the original barely said more than a few words and as for the 3 daughters were meant to represent the upcoming rise of women..they might as well have been played by extras.

Leslie Jones has a subdued performance (for her) that works well and Wesley Snipes shines in a way he hasn't in many years. Maybe I'm easier to please than most, maybe I like terrible movies.

1421,LordDavid,So many missed opportunities.,3,8 March 2021,"I didn't like it. It could have been far better than what we got.Here's my two cents.They could have gone through (to quote) ""a great deal of trouble"" to recreate the Zamunda Royal Palace interior, but what we got was a glorified mansion (which was the case, because they used Rick Ross' mansion).The original's dining room seemed large enough (and flexible) for formal banquets etc, including the reception hall setup they did for this film, yet they choose to use the ""renovated"" throne room for all these scenes?It needed more cameos. We never saw Semmi's mother in the first one (it was just referenced). Would have been cool if they had cast someone like Nichelle Nichols, for a brief cameo role.Cleo McDowell actually having left America to setup McDowell's in Zamunda. As a clever means to avoid McDonald's lawsuits and litigation, but most importantly to have complete monopoly over a non existent fast food industry.Patrice should have ended up with Darryl, even if not seen in the film, that's what the photograph montage should have had. A wedding picture of Patrice McDowell and Darryl Jenks. How hard is it to Photoshop such a picture with the approval from the actors?King Jaffe Joffer's ""death"" seemed forced. A nice joke would have been him pretending to fall asleep, only to open his eyes and say he'll actually be committing ""suicide/euthanasia"" by consuming ""cyanide"" like the greats have done in the past. Going out in style like a true absolute monarch.(King Jaffe Joffer wakes up exclaiming): ""A-HA! You thought I had just died didn't you (maybe breaking the 4th wall a bit while doing this)? Prepare the Royal poison!"" Oha: ""Prepare the Royal poison!""Why can't the My-T-Sharp barbershop guys do more boxing related arguments/jokes instead of throwing pop culture references at the expense of Akeem and Semmi? Maybe the initial scene before Akeem and Semmi enter could have had them discussing about Floyd Mayweather, Manny Pacquiao and Colin Mcgreggor, but also referencing back to Muhammad Ali.Something like: ""The Thrilla in Manila?"" ""Oh you mean Muhammad Ali, he would beat Manny's ass."" ""You mean Cassius Clay!"" ""Oh not this s*** again.""Lavelle scalps Madison Square Garden tickets? Why not have him actually work in the arena, where Akeem looks all over the venue for his son, then have the exact same scene with the ""man from the restroom"" from the first film taking a selfie with his phone.If they're going to do homages/in-jokes of the original, then do it right! The Prince to be Lavelle, could have been issued King Akeem's bedroom from the original. Having waken up by his royal groomer to undergo all the needless rituals from the first, then later complaining about it to Akeem ""It is not just that, it is everything.The grooming, the dressing, the butt wiping, the bathing... Actually, I rather enjoy the bathing."" This could have happened just before they flee back to America, stealing the Royal Jet.""But they stole the Royal Jet, your Majesty"". ""Then prepare the second Royal Jet! I am going back to America!""""Nextdoria"" should actually be in an aggressive footing (or more so) with Zamunda, especially after the rejection of General Izzi's daughter in marriage. There could have easily been border clashes as tensions rose between the two nations. What's wrong with a bit of CGI action scenes (and bloodshed) in a comedy film? Have the military do their border clash, after General Izzi realizes the ""King has fled"", then a fire fight with the Palace guards, overwhelming them, then ditching their AK's for more traditional stick weapons.Criticizing General Izzi for being a ""dictator"" when Zamunda is essentially an absolute monarchy. ""I don't recall Zamunda ever having a Prime Minister, did you?""To me, only the end was great (and truly made me laugh).So many missed opportunities, in what could have otherwise been a great film.",Coming 2 America

The idea of changing something that isn't broken has been done poorly on other movies so i was glad that this movie didnt change a winning format. The new cast members are all very good, the cameos surprise and delight. I suggest watching the original and then watch this one shortly after. The poor reviews surprise me, but each to their own.

The new actors held their own with the heavyweight original cast members. The cameo appearances were an added surprise. Ruth Carter's costume design was majestic.

Fortunately, because there are so many favorite parts in the original, the result is a good amount of enjoyable content here.It's a shame that I've seen ratings in the mid 5 range for this.

To make such a bold statement you better ride your wave high and mighty. Unfortunately, this is not the case here. I will say - nostalgia is strong here. Seeing returning cast, even the small supporting actors from previous one, attention to details and visible passion to go extra mile for making this movie - it brings back good memories, but having such a strong tie in to the original film, also shows all the shortcomings of the new one. ""Coming to America"" is still one of the most beloved romantic comedies in history and it is loved by almost everyone. What made it so great is intelligent writing, great characters, subtle and charming humor. In sequel - apart from the returning cast - humor is just loud and obnoxious, characters contradicting themselves and story focuses on things not many care about. Sure, with a sequel, it is only natural to expand on families with another generation, but did we really needed that? Was anyone asking for it?To wrap it up shortly - it's a below average movie, that tries to ride on the nostalgia, but ultimately with poor execution and characters contradicting themselves, it shows only how much we miss the original. There are moments here, that will bring you smile and joy, but those are only occasional occurrences that only serve to show how big of a quality gap it is between the original and a sequel.",Coming 2 America

Okay, I have to admit that my expectations were high, but OMG this was horrible all the way. The acting with some exceptions was subpar and some aspects of the movie were so forced, not natural at all.
I'm so disappointed that Mr. Eddie Murphy would write such junk. In my opinion this (the first one) is/was supposed to be a kind of a family movie, well I know it's not fitting for all ages but, the second one goes way too far on some moments and it misses a great opportunity to set a positive record.

But it's great nonetheless. Eddie's still got it. The cast is incredible! I love that most of the cast came back for the sequel. The new characters added a lot of new laughs and the original cast members/characters were just as funny as they were all those years ago. I did miss Eriq, tho. The throw back clips to the the first film were awesome, timely, and a smart move. They even threw my very favorite line (is that velvet?) from the first film back in. Looooved the nod to the Dukes, too! I loved the costumes and the dancers made me feel like I was right there in Zamunda. This film is a class act and it's so much fun. It doesn't try to be anything but that. Don't listen to a thing the haters say, Eddie. You did the first film justice by making the sequel a blast to watch. It was a great time, often laugh out loud funny. I liked it so much, I'm watching it again. Queen Aoleon would be proud. Well done!",Coming 2 America

The dancing general was ridiculous. Are they catering to five year olds? Also bringing in En Vogue, Salt 'n Pepa and Glady Knight was not only unnecessary but actually awkward because they were clearly trying too hard to improve on the magic of the throne room dance scene of the first movie but in doing so made it seem absurd and forced. The original dance scene was spectacular because it was authentic, but here they tried to merge authenticity with modern pop culture and it didn't work. In fact, they tried to do that throughout the whole movie and that made for one extremely insensitive scene in the barber shop where they said ""Obama united this country"" (no he didn't) to which one character replied ""Ya, but it's not like that anymore, now there are Nazis everywhere"", which I immediately felt was directed at Trump supporters who've been accused of being Nazis since 2016 and not only was it not at all funny, it insulted half the audience.

One could still tell a movie was a lighthearted comedy, without the in-your-face goofines and other bs.I don't know, man.. Well, at least the trailer didn't promise anything.

First of all, the storyline seems like it would be going to america, but nope. They were in america for a 15 minute moment, then the rest is about africa. So all the funny characters (Including the barbers) were shown for like a few minutes then stopped showing, in the first 5 minutes of the movie you instantly get slammed with 2 crazy twists, the king dies, and that the prince has a son. Yeah, as soon as you hit play pretty much. The humor wasn't very good. I was shocked how it was given a PG-13 rating because most moments and jokes in the movie is beyond for a child. Even I was a little uncomfortable watching some of the jokes, they just went to far.

I hated it with a deep resentment and disgust of our new society. Also a immense sadness washed over me as if I lost a piece of my childhood I'd never get back.

None of the DNA from the previous movie is here, there are some scenes that try to ""take you"" to the first movie. But the worst thing I think is the performance of Eddie Murphy, HE IS NOT AKEEM, he could not take the character again, he does not have the formula to interpret it again, it is true that people change over the years but our essence is the same and the character is not the same, he is the only one who makes the movie not work.

I was born in '85 so this movie has lived with me forever! I liked the plot Wesley was funny, Teyana Taylor did her thang, I was looking forward to seeing her dance! The funniest part was the fighting the lion part. I gave it 9/10 it's not the ""Filth Flarn Filth"" Eddie but the ""Nutty Professor"" Eddie. Enjoyed it!",Coming 2 America

1648,sjworldwide,"Fun revisit, great for a long-delayed sequel",8,6 March 2021,"This is a comedy, not a superhero epic, thriller, or award-contender drama. Comedies are usually casual and surreal fantasies by nature. It's also a sequel, filmed like 30+ years later by a different, non-legendary director. If you keep realistic expectations and just want a nostalgic, slightly modern spin on the original silly story, you'll be entertained. Eddie is still funny, but he's playing a different role now that he's getting old. The idea is simple, but effective enough for an escapist comedy sequel. Don't take personal offense by the artists continuing an old story. Just have fun. Enjoy seeing so many cast members and silly characters return - they all do great. Lots of laughs all around. Awesome soundtrack. The CGI is fine, especially for a comedy. Some touching moments - yes, there is still some heart in this one, and just enough modern sensibilities to avoid getting too serious. But of course it's clearly not as good as the original - the original is one of the best comedies of all time.",Coming 2 America

And saying it's political because of one Obama line or making a reasonable decision to make his daughter, who prepared herself for this her whole life, his heir instead of some dude he met three days prior? It has feminist undertones...Why do you habe a problem with Akeem having three string daughters how can kick serious ass? Come on...don't be ridiculous. Akeems father changed a law to allow him marrying Lisa. Why isn't Akeem allowed to do the same?The original German voice actor of Eddie Murphy, Randolf Kronberg, died a few years ago.

He was not afraid to ridicule the problems of the society of that time.This part is hard to call a movie. Everything is done in agreement with the modern agenda! A film that didn't even make you smile or think about anything.Time wasted!,Coming 2 America

It's really funny, I loved the costumes, hair updos, music, choreography, scenery, and in a Time were is a lot of tear shedding and sad events, this lighthearted movie has worked for me!Please don't be discouraged and give it a go!cast is wonderful as some new faces are promising.

It was a halt ending in all respects without leaving anyone or any situation out. That's hard to balance. This writing of this movie was successful in : -balance of all situations, laughing my a** off, many surprises with a surprise ending, even w/the obvious narrative. Oh man! I'm so happy they made this movie. I smiled from beginning to end. Loved it, loved it, loved it! Hercules! ;-)",Coming 2 America

1711,breadgunner-94454,Leslie Jones ruined it.,1,6 March 2021,"The first movie was awesome because it had great flow so didn't need constant loud irritating jokes.
This sequel is ok until Leslie Jones turns up to constantly interrupt it by being a vulgar loud mouth every 4 minutes.I waited 30 years for this movie and Leslie Jones ruined it in 60 seconds.",Coming 2 America
1712,martin-73932,It's not good! Best to leave 80's films alone...,2,6 March 2021,"No 80's remake/sequel is worth more than a 2 I'm afraid! The original humour from the 80's film era is outdated, so in a modern world you simply can't translate the humour accurately without upsetting too many people. In this film (like the Ghost busters remake disaster) the watered down version of the original humour simply isn't funny - it just looks like bad acting and writing!
If you can't honour the original properly because the humour is too offensive then best to offer us that original only and people can turn it off if they're too sensitive to the jokes!!!
I turned this film off after just over an hour - watched the original then watched Trading Places after.......and laughed my ass off!!",Coming 2 America

1714,ealanthony,Horrible,4,5 March 2021,The film was awful Im a huge fan of the first one but this was bad.. I laughed probably like once or twice during the film. I'm disappointed Eddie should of hired some good writers even though he's probably the one who wrote the whole film. I just feel like you can't follow up a master piece with garbage it taints the first one!!,Coming 2 America

1717,peterwilliamsmith,Glad they made it,9,5 March 2021,"If this film was perfect, it would have needed to be 4 hours long and possibly be split in two. There were plenty of references to the original, with only 2 main characters missing unexplained. It was light, fluffy and entertaining. Some things that would be inappropriate today were gone, rightly so. I feel they tied in old with new, did an amazing job at getting the cast back in, and glad they spent more time in Zamunda this time. Many old films are getting sequels on this nostalgia run, im glad they made this one. If it was a copy of the original people would hate it, if it was totally new, people would hate it. They blended old and new together, yet people still hate it. I dont get it, just enjoy the nostalgia, and fun.",Coming 2 America
1718,purviseddie,TRASH,1,5 March 2021,Wow...forced humor and horrible cast. Coming to America 2 and they were in America for 2 minutes. some movies shouldn't have a sequel...this is one of them.,Coming 2 America
1719,bhdrvv,Watch more than once!!!,10,5 March 2021,What is wrong with people and their eagerness to trash artistic work???? This is a wonderfully respectful movie that is obviously intended to pay homage to the first Coming to America while showing where we are in the world today. It's so cleverly done that you don't catch everything on the first watch but that's true of the first one as well! 30 years later I still find new things in the first one and I'm definitely looking forward to Coming 2 America to unfold for me for years to come. The one thing I didn't realize until seeing the new one is that the New York was a major character in the original and you do miss it while watching the second. Bravo to all that were a part of this instant classic and thank you for the sequel to one of my favorite movies of all time.,Coming 2 America
1720,randyfabiano,I loved the first the 2nd was terrible,1,5 March 2021,I turned it off. This is what happens when sequels dont have great writers. Total flop. Watched half way and was like what else is on. I truly loved the first the second was literally one of the worst eddie murphy films ever. Its almost as if CW said lets make another and try to be hip. Totally dumb and a waste of time and studio dollars,Coming 2 America
1721,patsfandad,Ignore the negativity here its a great movie (No Spoilers),9,5 March 2021,It is a soft reboot of sorts it does at time step over places it did in the 1st movie.But in a way that is enjoyable they hit all the nostalgic momentsThey also have some of their own as wellIt's a very well done sequel you rarely see after so longGood watch.,Coming 2 America

Gorgeous landscape. Had a lot of nostalgic moments. The new characters were beautiful and very likeable. Not a bad thing to say about this movie!",Coming 2 America
1729,everythingecommerce,I Was Expecting Much More.......,5,5 March 2021,"To start off Coming to America is my favorite movie ever and Eddie Murphy is my favorite actor ever. So to say i have been waiting for this my whole life is a understatement but sadly i am dissapointed.Cons-
1.They spent like 5 minutes total of the whole movie in America. what made the 1st one so good was the time they spent in queens and it was about the city and the people.
2.Needed more screen time of the original stars. John amos needed more screen time so did louis anderson. Eddie murphy and aresenio hall could have had way more screen time as well.
3. Tracy morgan and leslie jones were not needed in this movie. i love them but they just didnt mesh well in it for me.
4. They needed more time with the barbershop scenes those were funny.
5. It felt way too scripted and forced and fake. i barely laughed at all.
6. Take the political junk out of it and the ""woke"" messages.
7. Where was Daryl? Where was Lisa's sister? i felt like they should have brought back everyone and spent more time with the original cast and members instead of all the new people.
8. They needed to be more like the original instead of trying to ""fit in"" with todays culture.
9. They should have left the original ""soul glo"" and ""queen to be"" songs original!
10. They needed more funnier scenes and more Randy Watson! Like the chicken wing scene or the barbershop or church scenes in the original the sequel just lacked so much in the funny scene department.
11. As i said before the whole thing just felt like forced and scripted and fake comedy. None of the actors felt natural to me. everything just felt so off. like they were trying to hard and it felt too rushed.
PROS-
1. Having almost all of the original cast back was amazing!! true feeling of nostalgia.
2. The sets were amazing.
3. The costumes were epic and the movie alone deserves to win an award for the costumes and makeup.
4. While not no where near as good or funny as the 1st. This one to me had a different feeling. more like a love story and a closing of what the 1st one embarked on.
5. Wesley snipes played a good role in it i liked him the best. He felt natural to me still like he was just being himself and enjoying it. Everyone else to me just didnt act or feel like themselves.
6. Seeing the homage they paid back to alot of the original movie was amazing!! Like the mcdowells, louis anderson still there, the painting of randolph and mortimor duke lol that was a hidden gem.
7. the woman were gorgeous in it!!
8. everyone still looked very good for their age.
9. just seeing Eddie Murphy in another movie again is a massive PRO!
10. Seeing Randy Watson!!!!!
Overall the movie to me just felt to forced, fake and scripted. More like a remake paying homage to the original but poorly done. Too many cameos of people and at times just felt like a movie full of cameos. The story line was too weak and predictable. Not many funny parts in the movie. Nothing compared to the 1st one not even close! It was good but not great. i watched the original over 500 times in my life. This one i might watch a few times. They barely spent any times in queens and it did just not feel like the original at all. I appreciate the try but it needed more time and to be more polished. I wanted to see more of the original cast and not 90% of the movie with all the new people. The part where Akeem was moping and had the fatherly conversation with John Amos was the only part that Truly took me back to the 1st one. That was my favorite part! Overall id give it a 5/10.",Coming 2 America
1730,goodwinbrian-71623,So sad,1,5 March 2021,"So sad that I had to give 1 star. To expect it to be like the original is not realistic, but the only time it was funny was when they flashed back to the original movie. The king's funeral was stoopid and there was really no connection between any of the characters. There were only a handful of things that made me laugh. I laughed more at Eddie and Arsensio doing interviews about the movie. Even the out takes weren't even funny.",Coming 2 America

Semmi lookin like a ""slave from the future."" Hands down my favorite scenes were those with General Izzi of Nextdoria. LOL Wesley Snipes played that role well and his accent was hilarious it sounded sooo Nigerian with a touch of Ghanaian. They did the first movie justice in my opinion. I wanted it be just as corny as the first one and it did not disappoint. Kudos to Eddie Murphy for casting some of the funniest comedians in the game.",Coming 2 America

To be fair, the funniest thing Eddie Murphy has done for years, and the in-jokes with the barbers were funny. Obviously those giving one star missed these. I am from the older generation, and I reckon half the reviewers on here didn't get the tie ins. Especially the classic crossover with the Duke brothers.
5 stars because yeah it wasnt great, but it was certainly a break from the normal bleak, drab movies we are getting.",Coming 2 America

We needed more Daryl, barbershop, mcDowells and a better reason for coming back to America... no reason for 1/2 of the stars to have a role in this movie... what a disappointment!

I know this is all fiction but it has zero representation of what Africa is all about. A lot of flashback jokes that didn't hit.

Overall it was entertaining enough for a Friday at home. It was definitely not on the same level as the first one though.

Enough nods to the first to reward fans, enough recap for those who have not seen the first, a nice blending of newer and older material, and a spot on delivery by just about everyone in the cast.

Don't listen to the haters and those that do not understand Black culture. A mixture of old school and hip hop and African culture. Only those who can appreciate literally the hundreds of little hysterically funny nuances that reveal themselves through watching this movie many times will embrace this movie. I laughed out loud at least 50 times. Love it and looking to sequel 3. This movie should be allowed to be reviewed on Prime Video Instead of tracking this Byzantine review process through IMDB!

1778,pepsitruck-60833,Eddie Murphy must've really needed the money?,1,6 March 2021,"It's hard to believe this got the greenlight. The first Coming to America is a great film, one of my childhood favorites considering how close to NYC I grew up. This film is just one hot mess of cultural appropriation of the African continent, playing up stereotypes about Black Americans talking in a cliche and stereotypical way, and unironically the only people who come off as likable are Eddie's African daughters (those actresses did a great job, despite some not believable scenes).It's a ridiculous film. There were so many missed opportunities in character development. You could've changed the name of the film to anything else and had no idea it had anything to do with Coming to America.",Coming 2 America
1779,twarrington-54321,Great Sequel after 30yrs !!!!,9,6 March 2021,Nothing is ever like the original to something thats is what makes it a classic .. so you don't look for it to beat the classic but did the story continue well and be a good sequel.. YES !!! this was a great sequel to an all time CLASSIC 💯 I can go toe to toe with you and tell u why 💯,Coming 2 America

1784,dvrueda,It was ok until the race card started playing,1,6 March 2021,Typical Hollywood BS. It was nice seeing the old characters until they introduced the son. The scene immediately started playing the race card and I just stopped watching from there. It's pathetic that the race message has to be shoved into everyone's faces constantly as if that's all America is ever about.What a waste.,Coming 2 America
1785,kidar,Lighten up it is a comedy.,8,6 March 2021,"A wonderful film! If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh and help you escape your reality. Coming to America 2 is a great film and choice to watch with the family. Although a few characters, in my opinion- were unrealistic, i.e.(the barbers). Though, I still founded the film entertaining and humorous. And it was great to see a majority of the original cast from the previous first film be apart of the sequel, as well. However, I will have to say that this film was not a Rom-com. For me, the cinema was more of a comedy with bits and pieces of romantic scenes briefly shown- those plots never went into full depth to create an origin. So, if you are watching this film looking for anything, lovey-dovey, you'll barely find it in the sequel. But, be careful, if you blink too fast, you might miss it.",Coming 2 America
1786,uhsrws,"A for nostalgia, D- for storyline",2,6 March 2021,"Eddie Murphy waited 30+ years for a script worthy of a sequel. it turns out that wasn't long enough. Frank Scheck with the Hollywood Reporter nailed the description as a ""feature-length Easter egg in search of a movie"". The costumes and music were upbeat and well done and the movie was jammed full of nods to the original including nearly every original cast member. Wesley Snipes' character was a bright spot but the actor who played Murphy's son was a big miss. The movie didn't find the soul of the original movie until the last 15 minutes and by then it was too late. I hope Eddie Murphy keeps trying because he was one of the greatest of all time, but he needs a fresh writing partner.",Coming 2 America
1787,caitypurcell,What's up with the bad reviews?,9,6 March 2021,"First of all, the original is an absolute classic. You can't just make sequel and expect it to have the charm as the first one. That's with most movies. Overall, I enjoyed watching it. I had a lot of laughs. I think people's expectations are too high. Go into the movie knowing it's been THIRTY years since the last and embrace that. For it being a sequel 30 years later... I give them a lot of credit. The characters all had their charming personalities and there were a lot of characters I did not expect to see who did in fact make an appearance. Give it a try and stop being so critical!",Coming 2 America
1788,atseff,Pure Garbage,1,6 March 2021,"Truth be told, I could only stomach the first 30 minutes and stopped watching. I am a huge fan of Coming to America. I could watch it over and over on repeat and never get tired. I was really hoping to like the sequel even a little bit. It was like Eddie Murphy only signed on to do this if he could convince a bunch of other celebrities to make 'cameo' appearances in this film to make it seem credible. It isn't. And it's not remotely funny. And Eddie and Arsenio didn't even bother to pretend to try with acting, accents, or charm. I'm not sure why anyone signed on for this disaster other than a paycheck. It wasn't nostalgic. It was cringeworthy and embarrassing. Save 30 minutes and skip this mess. Tune in to the old movie and enjoy the classic. This one blows.",Coming 2 America
1789,ajeyrdmc,Trash movie,1,6 March 2021,"It's horrible written etc omg I can name so many things wrong with this movie. It's beyond dumb, no storyline kept hoping from scene to scene.

1790,jazebxrwm,Embarrassing. Pathetic.,1,6 March 2021,"Couldn't finish it. An hour in and my wife and I had had enough. Not only hadn't we laughed, or even smiled once, but I think we spent the whole time with a horrified/confused grimace on our faces.
It has no plot; the premise is really weak. The script is just appalling - not one funny line... not even a line that I thought ""OK, that would at least be funny to an idiot"". Nothing. The cast are rotten - the son and his American family are almost as dreadful as the son's wig in the first half of the film. Eddie Murphy himself seems utterly disinterested. He can't be that short of cash that he had to do this film?? And if he really thought it was worthy of his time, why was it not worthy of some effort and some comedic input.
Seriously one of the poorest quality films I've seen in a long, long time. Absolutely embarrassing.",Coming 2 America

I know that is hardly praise but surely people didn't watch this expecting a film as good as the original?It isn't great, but it isn't awful. I probably won't watch it again, but it's hardly a film that should be avoided at all costs.",Coming 2 America
1794,fkocran,Wanted to like it so bad!,1,6 March 2021,"They turned a classic well written script that was grounded in reality which only slight humourous exaggerations into some fantasy movie. Overacting, exaggerated, trash storyline and acting, 2 hours commercial for various brands, over did it with the joke references instead of creating new ones. So disappointed. I blame the change in director and addition writer they added...those are the main two variables that I believe could mess this up to bad. Taking this personal, this film was my childhood! Deserve a pimp slap!",Coming 2 America
1795,borgwald,Flat and forced humor.,3,6 March 2021,"I tried to like this Movie. Watched the first movie back in the 90's endless times. But the sequel is not even worth to be called a sequel. It looks very cheaply produced. At every time it seems watching a tv-series where content is filled with endless dialogs. Too bad, the dialogs in this movie are badly written, irrelevant, without heart and most of the time there is lack of any comedy and substance. CGI does not even fit and takes much of the movies atmosphere to be a sequel from a movie out of the 90's, which we all expected and hoped to get.",Coming 2 America

I absolutely loved it from start to finishWe cried and laughed and danced our way through itI will watch it again and again, like I did the fIrst onePerhaps our love for this movie is based on our genuine passion for the originalThey brought more real Africa into it which I adored, Wesley snipes did a great African accent ""Whose Aunty is this"" had me screamingDavido had me dancingRotimi is always great to seeI shed a tear when they spoke of Aoleon, RIP Madge SinclairOn the negative, parts of it felt a little rushed for sure, but I was biased and wanted it to last foreverI can't imagine how the writers would have had to battle as to whether they try to ""match"" the first movie, with a superb and impactful story and get slated anyways, or honour the first movie, and how to go about itWell, honour it they did, AmazinglyIn my eyes, it was just perfectTHANK YOUWell done to Eddie and the whole cast and crew",Coming 2 America

Yes the storyline is a bit lame but it adds to the silliness. I don't like the Leslie Jones character but they had to have someone new to shake it up. My only criticism is that I would have liked to have seen more of the sassy Lisa from the original. James Earl Jones was the icing on the cake as was the Macdowell's restaurant.

This is definitely one of those movies that you can watch over and over again. The added characters like Tracy Morgan and Leslie Jones were a pleasant and funny bonus.

For me, for someone who has been obsessed with the original for over 20 years I was excited but also concerned it wouldn't cut it...For one, I was relieved many of the original cast featured (and it wasn't ruined by too many newcomers or replacements).Yes the CGI isn't great and the storyline was okay. But there are some brilliant jokes, some wonderful nostalgic moments and overall I felt a delight to see these classic characters back on screen, in particular Reverand Brown and Randy Watson. Wesley Snipes as a warlord was also brjlliant!If you want a sensational film that is perfect in every way then simply watch the original... if you want some nostalgic reminders about it with a modern touch, sit back relax and enjoy!(And put it this way, nothing is as bad as the Bill and Ted's new film, which truly was an absolute disaster).

First, this is probably the best Eddie Murphy movie in 20 years. Second, the story line is solid and not far fetched. Third, they got the entire cast back in this movie which automatically bumps it up a notch. Fourth, it was funny and the characters played off each other well. Fifth and final comment, for a sequel to a movie that came out 33 years ago, it doesn't get much better than this. This isn't the original Coming to America so get your expectations in-line and enjoy it for what it is...you won't regret it.",Coming 2 America

1854,caribsnow,Love this movie to death!,10,7 March 2021,This is a fantastic remake 30 years in the making and they didn't miss a step! Filled with A list actors and an amazing script and soundtrack. I fully enjoyed the movie ( watched it twice this inaugural weekend). Kudos to the staff and crew.,Coming 2 America
1855,righteoustruth,Great Entertainment!,10,7 March 2021,"I thought Coming 2 America was charming, funny and entertaining. I will address all of the bad reviews by simply stating the obvious; some reviews were written by those who wanted Coming 2 America to be something that it is not. It's been over 30 years since the first movie, our world is different now, so change in tone and delivery should be expected. Why would anyone think the cast would look the same, perform the same or that the characters would have the same motivation? Akeem is now King of Zamunda, has been married for over two decades, and has three beautiful daughters. The story should reflect these dynamics, and it did, beautifully. Coming 2 America was exactly what I hoped it would be; funny, engaging, plenty of call backs to the original film, favorite characters returning, new characters added and a plot and premise that was not political or over complicated. Coming 2 America was introspective, hilarious and fun for the whole family. The set design and wardrobe were superb! I enjoyed the vibrant colors throughout the movie, the magnificent adornments for the hair and body and the scenes that included the citizens of Zamunda that captured the spirit of the Land. This depiction of Black Excellence, self determination, self realization, strong female characters, strong male characters and marvelous examples of character development made my soul smile. If you are a true fan of the original, you will enjoy this movie immensely! It is truly laugh out loud funny! So, delight in the splendor that is Coming 2 America with family and friends!",Coming 2 America

1858,michelledeceilio,So. Insanely. Bad,1,7 March 2021,I usually hate when they try to make a sequel years later to a classic. I decided to give this a chance since it had all the same actors in it. The storyline is complete garbage. I feel like they thought if they brought all the old actors together than who cares what the movie is about? Wrong. It lacked any type of attention grabber. The best part of the entire movie were the credits finally appearing. Swing and a total miss!!!,Coming 2 America

1876,z_sbts,Spends too much time on nostalgia instead of being a new movie.,5,8 March 2021,"There used to be this segment on SNL where Chris Farley, for laughs, would interview famous people and he would unwaveringly spend most of his time asking them if they remembered how good parts of their movies were. That is pretty much how this unasked-for sequel sadly spends most of its time, only there's no irony in it.""Remember that part in the original movie?""On the one hand, it is fun for fans of the original film who have burned most of its runtime into their brains to see so much of the old cast reprise their roles, but it's less fun when the script seems to regurgitate old jokes for them or worse yet, pigeonhole them as a small bit with a nudge going, ""Remember this person?""Of course, this nostalgia in itself doesn't make the sequel a terrible film, but it does take a significant amount of screentime away from the middling plot squirming around underneath. It doesn't seem to know where it wants to go and chooses weaker opportunities for laughs and character development than stronger, perhaps riskier ones. We spend too much time on the wrong characters and little to no time on the important ones, even if some of them are on screen most of the time. As a result, the plot doesn't feel like it delivers anything significant and the laughs aren't all that memorable, though some of the gags do work pretty well.Ultimately, there are worse ways to spend your time than watching Coming 2 America, but like almost everything else you might have seen lately, it has no staying power. It's an okay film that won't leave you with much of anything, but let's be real, when was the last time you saw something that wasn't?",Coming 2 America

1878,ikeorad,I enjoyed it though,6,8 March 2021,The movie was too focused in ensuring information sharing and education about what Americans wants the world to become. INFLUENCE. This made it not really a funny black movie but could be really funny to the whites.Also feels like this is not the real intended story. Should have also remained a story from Eddie Murphy's perspective as he knows man and as Africa is. seen better in part 1.Nothing wrong in making another fresh movie for a different gender perspective.Really doesn't feel African.I must say the 4 Nigerian artist delivered so well. Especially Davido with his empowering song for women.Oh Wesley Snipes and Michael Blackson delivered so well. They did so well.,Coming 2 America
1879,reisemper,Too many plot holes to be enjoyable. I had to watch the original in order to purge the sequel from my mind.,1,29 March 2021,"Cons:
1. Mary needs 31 candles on the cake which would make the ""son"" 31. If he was conceived 30 years ago, then that would make him 29. You can't be conceived 30 years ago and celebrating your 31st birthday.2. Mary already said she was promiscuous back in the day. Are we to assume that her son is heir to the throne without proof or a DNA test? I've seen enough Maury and Paternity Court to know better.3. The son stole THE jet to go back to Queens, but in the next scene, Akeem says to prepare THE royal jet. If he took the jet earlier in the day, how can you prepare it for use?4. In the original, Semmi said that he did not have ""relations"" since he was in America and was walking home alone with Akeem after leaving the club when he ran into Mr. Clarence and went to the Black Awareness event. When did Akeem have time to knock up Mary?5. In the original back in the 80's, the barbershop guys were already old. So, in 30 years, not only are they still alive, but barely aged.6. While Akeem was back in Queens, General Izzi just walks into the palace. I understand that it gives a reason to see how tough the daughters are. Where are the royal guards? No security?7. The only reason he wanted to know about his long-lost child is because he was a male. Shouldn't he want to know about this child, just because it could be his blood? If this child was a girl, there would be no movie.8. A lion eats live prey and fresh raw meat, not Friskies cat food.9. More product placement: Pepsi, Spotify, Puma,Friskies
10. The movie was PG-13 from the original being an R rating, so the sequel was more like a Disney channel movie. The target audience were millennials and Gen Z'ers, so my teenage son liked it.11. Are we suppose to forget the assault? Just because it's a man, that doesn't make it funny. If that happened to my son, I would be looking to press charges. Then Lisa becomes BFFs with her husband's attacker?!?!?!12. The younger daughters served no purpose in the movie. The middle daughter is Eddie Murphy's daughter in real life: 5/10, so that's why she's in the movie.13. Too many unnecessary musical numbers. If you are supposed to be in an African country, you would play more African-centric music. At least some African hip-hop/R&B which is really good.14. At the beginning of the movie, we see the rose bearers prepping, but no rose bearers throwing down roses. So, what was the point of showing that scene other than to give purpose to Garcelle Beauvais, who looks great after 30 years.15. Should have been a reboot, not a sequel.16. Was it a coincidence that the royal barber made the son look like Killmonger from Black Panther?17. The CGI and green screen was obvious and cheaply made.18. They were only in America for about 15 minutes. Where was the Coming 2 America part? It should have been called Coming From America.19. For the last ""challenge"", he was supposed to get circumcised as a prank, but he still pulled his pants down in front of everybody, including his sisters. How was that funny?20. Unnecessary cameos, like you said, anybody in Atlanta that needed some money. Dikembe Mutombo? Why?21. Akeem had his face cracked when Lisa said he wasn't the only man she was with. Did we forget that she had already had a boyfriend Daryl when they met?22. Should have let all the comedians in the movie ad-lib and do what they do: be funny, and not confined to lazy writers and a terrible script.23. The oldest daughter saved the day by working out a trade agreement with Nextdoria. Completely glossed over and was ignored.24. Bring John Landis back. The movie would have been much better.Pros:
1. Nostalgia factor in that they brought back all the old characters.2. I loved the costumes and the hairstyles.3. It was free with Amazon Prime, so it was no loss, only a waste of time.4. Cash grab for Eddie Murphy.5. The outtakes were funnier than the movie. They should release the outtakes.6. Gladys Knight.7. Wesley Snipes comedic timing.",Coming 2 America

The comedy it haves been change, so a sequel of a funny movie have to change as well. I really enjoy it and to be very honest, I actually laughed more with this movie than with the first one. And I feel so sorry, that critics doesn't enjoy comedy any more. Have any of you realize comedy have been underrated for many years, and I don't know if critics are sooooo sooo sooo old and boring that the only funny movie for them is the once from the 80' and some from the 90'.

Most dissappointed I was in E. Murphy, very cool comedian throughout career, why the heck did you participate in a movie so bad?
The political correctness agenda was just making me nauseous but when you get past through that, the scenes and stupidities in plot was just too much.
I only could endure 20 minutes and then scrolled through the rest.

The random singing and dancing scenes I didn't care for and I wish they had said fxxx it and kept to the eighties edgy very close if not offensive humour.

1890,aude-36631,I wanted to like it so baaaaad!,3,8 March 2021,"I really did want to love it..but couldn't.
First of all. I didn't like the fact that they want me to never look at the first CTA the same way again. Like from now on I'm supposed to believe the innocent prince who was looking for his princess had been deceived by his best friend, then drugged and assaulted by some random witch?..(talk about it being rated PG13 this time around)...Hum no I'll stick to watching the first movie thinking of Akeem and Semmi the way I always saw them.
Ok back to this sequel ..or should I say parody?
A lot of people said it but let me say it too: it felt like a SPOOF! Like ""Scary movie"" was to "" I know what you did last summer"" and other movies...this felt like the spoof for the 1st CTA, mixed with some ""Black Panther "" and a little bit of ""Shaka Zulu ""... Like the wayans brothers had worked on the script.( That in itself is not bad as long as we know what to expect.)
Then they fly to America for 2 seconds and a half grab little dude with no verification then back to Zamunda..but who cares? Because Zamunda 30 years later..feels like America anyways!
Yes the outfits are on point and there is an elephant and a lion...but please is that enough to claim Africa ?!
Why would an old African king, who is too attached to his ancestral traditions to allow his grand-daughter to be Queen, want EnVogue, Salt N' Pepa and Gladys Knight at this funerals? Like c'mon!
This whole segment was completely out of place and it felt like all these celebrities had called each other and were like : ""Girl I'mma be in the sequel! ""..."" Giiirl me too girl!"" And the producers were just like ""yeah why not, bring them all in, that'll do it!""
They felt too lazy to do some research for accuracy. Why not call some old time African musical legends?
Why not call Koffi Olomide or Fela kuti or Youssou Ndour for the old timers and Fally Ipupa and Diamond Platinumz for the new ones?
And the dancing..super americanised I mean in the first movie the dancers' moves were very close to authentic. Do some research Hollywood people. There are tons of youtube videos of young Africans dancing to afro beats..that's the thing in Africa right now..how do you portray an African event and there is no african move, no Gwara-gwara no Azonto...etc nothing!
Then the young prince is not likable but that's not his fault...the script and directing are weak. Why would a 30year old man run to his mama talking about "" Mama! there are women in my room trying to bathe me""?...or whatever
His love for his barber came out of nowhere... Child why are you ready to marry her? Cause she twisted you hair real good? Or is it that she cut that fake ponytail? Nah...more cause she likes Hollywood movies and wants to start her own business...wow
The actress is very good though,tries to make her character believable but child... there is nothing to work with!
Wesley snipes' performance is on point, I liked it a lot, but again the character is a caricature so it would have been perfect in a SPOOF!
Queen Lisa tries her best too..but her character is inconsistant...it took 2 flights to America behind her back and 2 big deceptions for her to finally get seriously mad.
And for Akeem to say "" this is BS ""when he gets the cold shoulder... in what part of Africa do they say that? If he had said "" this is nonsense"" the whole scene would have been accurate!..One word change would have made him authentic.I whish they had looked into some other ideas like why not have a legitimate child: son or daughter of the family, coming to America to visit their mom's side of the family or even learn about that part of their heritage and then being the fish out of water who falls in love and brings back a spouse. But then random Lesley Jones wouldn't get to be the crazy baby mama..ugh..

The whole plot was based on a date rape incident that wouldn't of even happened in the first movie. They just threw the first idea out and went head first. The son is supposed to be a 30 year old man but they write him as a teenage boy. For example he refused to go to Zumunda without his mother, I found it quite strange that a grown man can't go anywhere without his mother, even in the scene where you he is about to take a bath with three women, he runs and tells him mom.

In the original the main character had a charm about him that made you feel what was on the screen this dude not an ounce. It was weird I honestly just enjoyed seeing the old characters that I fell in love with in the first one. If you haven't seen the first one (what rock have you been hiding under) then maybe you can appreciate this one.

The flat characters are nowhere near his old days and Eddie Murphy shows with this film that he is definitely behind his times as an actor and as a comedian.All in all, there are a few smaller parts that are worth a quick laugh, but overall the film is a dreary series of a few music and dance scenes, some of which are also deeply bad.For me it is the film with the most chance of winning the Golden Raspberry AwardGreetings to everyone from Germany",Coming 2 America
1905,frazwardo,Lack of diversity and casual racism,1,9 March 2021,"In a time when we're campaigning for diversity and inclusion, I was amazed that the cast included only a couple of white actors.
Add to that the comments in the script. I turned it off when one black actor told the other not to talk 'white' before a job interview. It's offensive and unacceptable and I'm sure if two white actors had said this about not talking 'black' it would have created an uproar! It's divisive especially in the current climate. Racism affects people from multiple backgrounds and should be addressed accordingly.
Up to that point, rubbish film anyway!",Coming 2 America

1908,toba-52717,The kind of movie that gets better each time you watch it,10,9 March 2021,"I must admit, my first view of it left me wondering what to make of it. I liked some aspects but some other aspects looked tired to me.However, I watched it a second time, then a third and since it was released, I am ashamed to say I have watched it at least once every day. Each time, I uncover new jokes, new detail I missed in previous passes, and connections I failed to make before.I saw the mask of Oduduwa.I saw the old Cross River king - King Duke of Calabar .I got to know Bopoto's first entrance song was a remake of Prince's ""Get Off"". I loved that scene.I laughed each time the lion farted. He gave a ""Oh, it's is just a human"" look at Lavelle and goes right back to resting his head and lets out a loud one. It gave me great joy to see animals so comfortable and without fear in the presence of humans. This is how it should be.I loved that the same taxi driver that Eddie Murphy stopped in the first one is the same one he stops in the sequel...only that now he is a Uber driver and getting in one is a complicated process now.I loved the fact that a Duke's descendant is using his position of privilege which was only made possible by the Zamunda Prince's generousity in the first one is looking down his nose on Prince Akeem's son.I particularly was impressed by Kiki Layne's performance. She was believable as royalty. She got it.The barber shop scenes were/are indispensable to the film. Amazing effort by Clint Smith. He is so underrated. His performance was great in both. A shame his face is covered in all that makeup.ConsI am not sure why that particular song by Davido was the one chosen. There are so many better...of his and other artistes...but hey...The cutting of the Lion's whiskers could have been better shot , in my opinion. But that is just a minor niggle.I got the impression that Eddie Murphy as a father is still quite protective of Bella. He probably remembers how he was as a young man/ boy. Sorry, Eddie, your daughter will eventually become the object of many male's ( and some female's) fantasies. You cannot avoid that...but I understand his kicking the can down the road. I have a feeling we have not seen what that young lady is capable of ...yet.I give it 10 stars because it is one people will watch again and again for many years to come and once all this hatred towards anything that supports racial equality dies out or down, people will really appreciate it for the classic it truly is.",Coming 2 America

This is not a movie that is going to win a bunch of awards but if you go into ready to laugh in my opinion it will not disappoint. My family of 4 found it hilarious and I will suggest seeing the first one before watching this one. Is this the funniest movie I have ever seen, no, but it is definitely one I can watch a few times.

They did an awesome job of putting in nice throw backs to the first movie which was very nostalgic....You had a look at African American and African culture along with social commentary on present day social issues. They showed beautiful African fashion, culture, and style and the music was awesome. They referenced breaking tradition for the good of moving forward. They had an all star cast and it was tastefully done...This is a keeper to buy and watch with the family....Eddie should be proud...after 30 years he did an excellent job!!

How can so many talented and funny people (mainly Murphy, Hall and the writers) get it so wrong? Surely someone on the set would have the intellect to say, ""Actually, Eddie, I think we should stop filming until we get this script sorted out"". And while they're at it, why not write a more rounded character for Leslie Jones than the 'unintelligent but sassy black female' that permeates through so many Hollywood films?

It seems the Producer (Murphy?) tried to stuff every possible black entertainer into one film, and failed miserably in pulling it of. The opening ""musical"" scene was idiotic, unentertaining and completely dumb. Why did Freeman and Jones stoop so low to even appear in this film? The comedic scenes are completely sophomoric and flat. I am surprised more people are not deeply offended by the ridiculous and offensive characterization of black people in this film.

He and Arsenio Play at least 10 different characters. The get-ups are hilarious. Even the disgusted faces they make, make me crack up.Arsenio Hall, Wesley Snipes and Leslie Jones will make you laugh your ass off. Tracey Morgan, James Earl Jones - funny as hell. Jermaine Fowler and all the younger actors were spot-on! The production, the music and costumes are over the top. Then the jokes - one joke after another. I could go on and on. And, to top it all off, there are some great connections to the original movie, while told in a new story that has some good lessons.I usually am very critical of sequels.

Instead you have cheap jokes that aren't interesting or funny, in fact they're stupid, hackneyed and derivative. The movie seemingly is afraid of the culture running wild in today's America and so the movie plays the race card, softly teasing one group yet celebrating diversity ... in incredibly moronic ways.The plot was uninteresting.

What a different experience! Coming 2 America is just NOT FUNNY. It rehashes the old jokes but attempts to give them a modern, politically correct slant. I don't like the term 'woke' as its often used to put down perfectly legitimate criticism of outmoded language and behaviour but this film personifies the term perfectly.

Although it has a cast of familiar faces, it didn't bring the same energy. I smiled a little while watching this film but there was nothing I found laugh worthy. That was the most disappointing point. I didn't laugh and I had hoped to.",Coming 2 America

The appeal of a second movie some 30 years later should be set on building onto the existing storyline, not redoing it with a younger actor. When will people realize, DO NOT DO THE SAME STORYLINE over and over again. This is not success.Also, I don't know who needs to hear this but Eddie Murphy, please retire.

I'm laughing and smiling from the beginning. It's not the most original film ever made, but it doesn't take itself seriously. It's fun and well done. Paused halfway to get some ice cream and take a bathroom break and discussed the fact that these reviews are ridiculously slanted. It's a good film.

It was safe and that helt this movie back. Now there were several jokes with some physical comedy so funny I couldn't breath. (You like pumpkin pie?).It's a good movie and worth a watch.

Yes, the frequent product placement and brand name mentions are disturbing. The story line is ridiculous and the characters are caricatures of themselves. But for this is a movie that is enjoyable merely for nostalgic reasons. It is a facsimile of the original, barely recognizable since over three decades have passed since.

Unfortunately this film has many negatives the shoddy cgi, re used story from original movie, some jokes that fall flat and feel more like cringe, Eddie Murphy's Zamunda accent that appears then disappears at will .
This felt like its just trying to ride on the success of black panther(I know a lot of black panther looked and felt like coming to America).Ultimately this film just tries too hard.

I usually don't walk out of the cinema but it this case I would have.The story was there but it didn't quite get there and it was a bit of a flop! It wasn't half as funny as the first one and sometimes it doesn't work then they do a sequel and it this case it didn't work!I like how they had the clips from the first movie but somehow it didn't work!

It seemed like it was geared towards families so those of us who'd seen the first movie would be able to show the younger ones this contemporary version. The only funny parts were when they showed clips of the original and when the old man characters Murphy and Hall played in the original appeared. Lesley Jones was the funniest of the rest.

2054,bcikarda,The real joke is the movie itself,1,14 March 2021,"And it's not a good joke at all.Absolute disgrace to the original that I've rewatched recently. Original movie had the classic heroes journey going - a clear hero, call to action, stepping out into the unknown, transformation, atonement and then return. A story we all know and love and a story that most great movies tell. Unfortunately it's not the one that this movie tells. I can't even tell what's it actually trying to tell because it seems that no one in the movie does.
However whatever this movie is trying to tell you seems not useful at all. This makes the watching experience rather boring and even unpleasant. Untastefuly awful editing and terribly implemented music of questionable quality just adds bitternes to a already sour taste this movie leaves.Absolutely do not recommend to anyone with a brain, really, just don't waste your time on it.",Coming 2 America

But aside from the cast, the whole thing felt forced, laboured, lazy and above all else, lacked the heart and soul of the original. Leslie Jones was almost completely unlikable and I don't know what was going on with Wesley Snipes' character, whom he played in a rather bizarre (and unfunny) way. All the wit and charm of the '88 film was gone, there were many scenes shoehorned in just for padding - worst of all was the 'rap off' between Akeem's son and his proposed bride to be - and the whole thing was completely forgettable as soon as the credits rolled.

But wow was was this terrible. Don't get me wrong, even for a rubbish flick, it was great seeing the old characters or jokes, but it appears they tried way to hard to include anything and everything from the previous movie. I did like the costumes and the cast, mostly but it ends there. Pile on the sad attempt to include any and every big name they could find for poorly done musical numbers, then drop in and over abundance of easy lame sexually charged jokes and voila! Garbage sequel. The first movie was creative, hilarious and could even be considered warm and wholesome. The sequels is just overdone, not funny, lazy, drivel.",Coming 2 America

I have been a long time fan of Eddie Murphy, Wesley Snipes, James, Arsenio and so many others in this movie. I enjoyed all the familiar faces and seeing where the characters would be thirty years later. Snipes being over the top had me laughing every time he walked in the room. I think the struggle with tradition and the need to see when change to those traditions are necessary was a very real and valid message even if it was understated.

2085,dj-muir86,A brilliant modern sequel that is full of laughs!!!,9,7 March 2021,"Coming 2 America is great. And like as its predecessor is a heart felt, visually appetizing, and a different perspective of a magical love story. First off...the cast is wonderful, and the range of characters from Murphy & Hall are wondeful comic vehicles throughout the whole movie. The newer additions of Wesley Snipes and Leslies Jones both shine in very distinct roles, as well as the younger women cast as the Princesses as they are so beautiful and talented. There were also too many cameos to count...Morgan Freeman to En Vogue, Gladys Knight to Colin Jost. James Earl Jones is delightful if just for the first few scenes and captures the original bravado of the King. The current Queen(Shari Headly) has evolved from classy girl of Queens to real Royalty, and in the characterization allows the air of her role to carry her differently. John Amos, Loius Anderson, Izzi the double arc...even the royal announcer...all are back to stroke our imagination. Together it creates a world that could very well be entwined in our own. I applaud the representation of this film and is predecessor...as it helps enrich the black experience...and celebrates continental heritage and culture. Like the original...the costuming itself deserves an Oscar. This film has a very distinct feel to the original...they are both unique masterpieces. Every ornate placement of jewlery, and the inticate crowns, gowns and capes... even the backgroundund cast are full decked out. The entirty of the movie is blocked such. I was enthrawled with the craftmansship and uniquness of contemporary African couture. And frequently through the movies are pieces placed in unconventional ways..a mixed media of shells, metals, jewels, and silk. I dont think I can compare it to any current movie on the market. And unlike the chic pastels of the original...this embraces a more luxurious and ethereal quality. Apparently it was filmed in Rick Ross' house...and may I just say the man has great taste....or maybe that's the set designers. Just like the costumes...the decor is both culturally beautiful and modern. There are pieces that i would love in my own home and could also see in museums. The backstory plot is worked almost effortlessly into the current timeline with a flashback clearing up any mystery. It keeps the flow of the movie and introduces the new ensemble quickly. Thus creating a time crunch and the necessity of a love story. And although the writing gets a little sticky...the actors characterizations keep the movie alive. The love development between Javelle and his Royal Groomer (Nomzamo Mbatha) was too short. I wish there was more time to explore their chemistry. It was notable in their first scene... but wasnt given enough real time to really evolve. But the packaging of the movie is more about letting everyone shine than just a too be prince. Acting MVP - Welsey Snipes as General Izzi. He is both intimidating and fun...with swagger and humour. I really appreciated his dedication to this individual and really shows his versatility. Biggest perk- the costuming is divine. I hope that in my life I can wear something half as beautiful. Overall Im glad the audience can visit Zumanda again...and honestly hope that we can explore the lives of the young princesses in the future.",Coming 2 America

That being said, though this was one of my favorite films of all time, I almost didn't watch this movie after reviewing the independent reviews on this site. I partook by way of my on reasoning, guided through nostalgia. I am unspeakably happy I did! I don't understand what you people want. THIS WAS A WONDERFUL FILM! They hit every mark imaginable, reprising every role, paying homage to every scene, scenario, and plot outline in the first film. It was funny, clever, and very nostalgic to watch. I feel all negative reviews simply point to the generational differences inherent in the film, BUT IT HAS BEEN OVER 30 YEARS since the first was brought to screen! A classic remake would have gotten even worse reviews! As the humor of the 80's would not adhere today, and would be completely unrelatable. WATCH THE FILM. You will not be disappointed.

2115,t_mladenovic,Oh come on people,6,10 March 2021,"Movie is really not that bad! I red some of the comments and I expected a terrible movie, but this was quite funny :) honestly what did you expect? Of course it's not like the first movie, and of course we knew how it's going to end but don't be so judgmental and just enjoy the movie...
The first movie had original idea and for that time it was hilarious and you can't compare the humor in movies then and now. They wanted to keep the same type of humor and if they would make it more in the style of the comedies that we enjoy now - it wouldn't have the same charm. My parents loved the movie before and they also laughed at this one :) we are living in a time where movies are coming out every day and we expect more and more and better every time and we forget how it is to just sit with our family, watch a movie and have a good laugh...and oh - not having a possibility to stop the movie and take the phone to write hateful comment.
I hope this comment can help <3",Coming 2 America

2119,c-michel76-601-354907,Fantastic!,9,6 March 2021,"I knew Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall would make a great sequel! And I knew that haters would hate it.
The movie is a total who-is-who of black american comedy (plus the great Louie Anderson). Tracy Morgan is hilarious as the step dad and Leslie Jones is the funniest woman on earth anyway.
I love that the movie is not like the first movie but moves on to the next generation with EM and AH still pretty much involved in it.
And even though the men are still the main characters in this movie the female characters are strong and often times deserve more respect than the male ones. Fantastic! The movie also takes some of the misogynistic jokes from the first movie and just exposes them as the creepy, crazy stuff from a different time that they are (the barking promised bride for example).
Whoever wants to see the same movie as the first one, just move along an re-watch the first movie. This movie is for the 21st century and not for people stuck in the 80ies of last century.
It has a few flaws, like the blue/green screen especially in the lion scenes looks terrible. But in the end that is not important because if you want to watch a safari movie than go watch a safari movie. This is a comedy!
I enjoyed this movie very much and had a a lot of good laughs (Leslie Jones is just the GOAT).",Coming 2 America

However, after watching Eddie Murphy's last major comedy, My Name is Dolemite, I'll admit I had a tiny glimmer of hope for this movie. The tone and direction in this movie are completely different than the original and the original characters almost feel like an after thought in this film. The original movie was pretty much nonstop laughs and I looking back I don't think I laughed even once during this. I enjoyed seeing the guys from My-T-Sharp again but other than that this felt like a major missed opportunity. Also, PG-13 sequels to rated R movies always feel hollow...",Coming 2 America
2128,rocktress20042001,Love this movie for all the right reasons,10,8 March 2021,"The ""Coming 2 America"" they wanted to see:
1. Akeem knowingly walked away from his son
2. Lisa and Mary fighting instead of being friends
3. Lavell selling dope instead of game tickets
4. A new light skin person to the rescue
5. Meeka chasing a man instead of chasing her purpose. She trained her whole life to be a Queen, not some man's queen.
6. Akeem having it all together and figured out
7. Lisa's thottin sister still running around causing chaos
8. Lavell rejecting Akeem
9. Lavell at least sleeps with Bopopto Izzi because she's sexy
10. Akeem kills General Izzi because it's impossible to make peace with an enemySome of you need to say what you mean, it wasn't ratchet enough for you. You might have missed the quality of the movie because you missed the fact that you were watching a story of emotionally grounded people! Some of you watched only wanting to laugh, not think, consider, understand, or grow. So, if you didn't slap your knee laughing you wrote off the movie as trash because you have no further dimensions. I commend Eddie Murphy for not reducing the brand of his franchise to fit the ratchet and ridiculous representation of blacks we see in media today. Job well done. This depiction of black excellence served my soul well. You don't have to give it 2 thumbs up just because it's black produced, but don't give it 2 thumbs down just because it's black produced either. In life it's never the fact that you dislike something or someone; it's how you ""dislike"" that reveals your character.",Coming 2 America

The movie is build around the product placement. 1/3 of all scenes are in this movie because of McDonalds, Pepsi, Puma or Spotify(-artists). Its a TV Ad at best.

It is a hard movie to create a sequel to but I truly feel like they did the best they possibly could in recreating this second film. They stay true to the classic by keeping the original cast while adding in New actors actresses and performers. To be honest not too many people are going to be satisfied when recreating such a classic film but I feel this film stands on own. And is a great addition to the original funny love story.

2144,shortcircuittwo,The King is dead.,1,15 March 2021,"Despite what you may think from the trailers and media, the plot of Coming 2 America mostly takes place in Zamunda, with a very brief and convenient journey to America in which Prince (now King) Akeem improbably has no problem immediately locating his illegitimate son within about 10 minutes of arrival, a son who he has never seen and was seemingly conceived in a scene that didn't exist in the first film. Despite poorly rendered flashbacks trying to convince us otherwise.As for Zamunda, don't expect sweeping landscapes and beautiful exterior shots of the African plains, instead we are treated to 90% interior shots filmed in Hip-Hop producer Rick Ross' palatial Hollywood home.It's a generation-flipped fish-out-of-water tale, where Akeem's newfound son must learn the ways of a Zamundan Prince in order to marry the daughter of a neighbouring warlord (Wesley Snipes, seemingly auditioning for a reboot of The Mask) and prevent some sort of war. Think ""Crocodile"" Dundee 2, only if it was all filmed inside a mate's house and was populated with an un-necessarily huge cast of all Paul Hogan's friends & family.Coming 2 America is everything wrong with modern movie-making. It's cheap, rushed, bereft of any kind of inventiveness and riddled with unnecessary bad CGI and gratuitous celebrity cameos thrown in seemingly to pad out the film. The plot is weak, messy and obvious, the characters are less-than one dimensional and cartoonish. Gone are the subtlety and charm of the original, replaced here with over the top ham performances (Wesley Snipes, Arsenio Hall) and gurning that would make Jim Carrey wince.The female characters are just scenery or punchlines. The original film's love interest Shari Headley is criminally underused, spending the majority of the film asleep and usurped here by an equally under-used Leslie Jones. Despite early promise that the pair's rivalry would lead to a promising sub-plot, this is instantly dropped without resolution.But the film's biggest flaw is it just isn't funny. I am a huge fan of Eddie, his 80's work fills my top ten films of all time and his 90s and 2000s output has some real classics too, but this is Murphy at his bloated, over-indulged worst. Murphy spends the majority of the film looking pompous and smug, dials in his performance and might as well have sat in the corner counting his paycheck for all the trademark charisma he displays.As a fan, I've unfortunately seen (and forgiven) some bad Eddie Murphy films: Meet Dave, The Adventures Of Pluto Nash, Showtime, Imagine That, A Thousand Words. I've seen some terrible sequels to John Landis' films: American Werewolf In Paris, Blues Brothers 2000, National Lampoon's Delta House. I've even seen a bad Eddie Murphy sequel directed by John Landis: Beverly Hills Cop 3. This follow up to the classic 1988 original has to take the crown for being one of the worst Eddie Murphy films, John Landis sequels, sequels, and just films in general.Eddie Murphy following his Golden Globe nominated performance in Dolemite Is My Name with Coming 2 America is one of the biggest comedy career mis-steps since Bill Murray committed a similar example of career suicide by following Lost In Translation with Garfield: The Movie. This is a misfire equal to Murphy following his Oscar nominated role in Dreamgirls with his Razzie nominated turn in Norbit.The absolute worst part of this is that because it premiered on a streaming platform, box office is of no concern. The hundreds of bad reviews and negative feedback will not stop the 'Powers That Be' from bankrolling more insipid cash-in sequels to existing titles to appeal to that all-important nostalgia buck. With the success of this atrocity, you can undoubtedly brace yourselves for Nutty Professor 3, Beverly Hills Cop 4 and - *throws up in own mouth* - Norbit 2.You have been warned...",Coming 2 America

Hell no. Please do a remake. I mean a totally revised version.One other note: How come with this star studded cast the show came up with a Lavalle who is while being an adult already not only shorter than his mom Mary but also not really resembling anything like Akeem...
Somehow the daughter of Izzi Bopoto really doesn't feel credible with this ""I like what my king likes"" lines, I would have rather expected a disconnect between them because of Bopoto giving an indication of being some predator herself rather the same as her father...Anyway, please take another shot at it.

They want the same over the top no holds barred comedy as the first failing to realize 1) we live in a new age where some jokes and behaviors will literally cost you everything. 2) these people are older and more mature, why are you expecting them to be who they were 30 years ago?
Overall the movie was good. It wasn't the first because it wasn't trying to be. It's a movie that gave you the characters you loved in the original. The plot is your prototypical trying to find one self in a new role in life. The comedy is good. It's not over the top or forced like many movies with an all-star cast. They let things happen. Will I say it was great? No, but I don't think they were trying to make it that. They knew they wouldn't compete with the first, so they just made it something the family could enjoy. It's not a lot of cussing which I think is on purpose.
Only issues to me is lesslie Johnson was over the top at some points and Eddie's accent would switch from prince Akeem to Max from vampire in Brooklyn. Other than that it was good. No it wasn't preachy or dull like others above my review are saying. It had a message it drove it home a bit, but was still good.

I heard many disappointing brief reviews about this movie but still wanted to see it, for sentimental reasons if nothing else, and possibly because of low expectations, I was actually entertained by it. I will fully admit that it would be tough to see this movie without seeing the original and expecting it to make a lot of sense, but if you do plan to see the movie, make sure you've seen the original and don't expect the world. That said, what I DID expect was simply a total rehashing of the original, which, at times, it was. The reason I gave it 7 stars instead of 5 or 6 is that it very quietly took on some different issues outside what I expected, which I'd rather not give away, since I was glad not to have known myself when I watched and I recommend you do the same. If you expect the world, you'll probably hate this, but if you don't expect much, you can enjoy some old faces, a few very impressive new ones, and a handful of fully expected as well as, in my estimation, some very unexpected cameos as well. Just enjoy it!",Coming 2 America

Going in with an open mind, I was looking forward to pure Murphy comedy genius. Instead I was treated to a movie with multiple musical numbers, a lack of character development and very little Eddie Murphy presence. Instead this was a showcase of todays comedy celebrities without the punchlines or laughs. The movie is conflicted: is it a comedy, romance, or drama?

I LOVED the movie and I loved romantic comedies and Eddie Murphy, and I was for some reason obsessed with Louie Anderson.I was less than enthusiastic when I heard that they were making a sequel to the movie. I had been burned too many times before! But, on a whim, I decided to watch it anyway. I loved this one as well! Seeing all of these actors come back together, watching them bring these characters back to life after all these years, I couldn't help but feel all of the fun they had radiate through the screen.While there are some (fantastic) new additions to the cast, almost TOO many cameos from stars I'm assuming loved the first one and just couldn't pass up being a part of the franchise, and a few jokes that are a little too cheesy or a little too cheeky, the same idea that love perseveres and the world continues to evolve makes this feel like you're getting those same warm fuzzies you'd feel from watching your old favorite rom-com over and over again.",Coming 2 America

The story is weak, the humour is that of a tv movie and its just not funny. In the 1980's Eddie Murphy was the funniest man alive but now he just walks through some performances and this happens to be one of them.
The only thing that stands out is Wesley Snipes and the great costume designs, its great to see all the old characters back together but that can't hold this film together, they added too many new characters but should have just kept with the originals.My best advice go and watch number 1 over and over and over again.

2266,suzanne-65636,Loved this fresh update and seeing the cast together,9,8 March 2021,"If you are wondering why all the negative reviews, it's because the story revolves around ending the rule that only a son can be placed on the throne. The original movie revolves around similar themes of the prince bucking royal tradition. This is why do many reviews are crying that it's ""woke.""My daughter and watched the original first. I had not seen it in ages and she had never seen it. I highly recommend to watch that way. There are lots of little moments you catch.The fashion is just as memorable and fun as in the original, and Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall are delightful. The new young cast members playing the children are able to stand their own against veteran actors.1 star off because I really wanted a Samuel L Jackson cameo.",Coming 2 America

I feel as if the new industry took the greatest American comedy film ever and turned it into hot garbage
After half an hour the warmth faded and then the poor plot, half baked humour and overdone unnecessary callbacks incorrectly utilised killed some of the memory of the original

Eddie Murphy is once again back to being the funny character actor I've enjoyed since his debut on SNL. Every comedian in this movie delivers. Arsenio Hall,Tracy Morgan, and especially Leslie Jones are in top form. Also in top form are the more ""serious"" actors. Wesley Snipes, James Earl Jones, and John Amos. Add in a sprinkle of Morgan Freeman, En Vogue,Salt Pepa, and Gladys Knight for Cameos and its a winner all around. Back off haters and chill out,relax, and just enjoy.",Coming 2 America

It felt flat, rushed, unfunny and forced in parts.
I had so much expectation to see this and bring back memories I'd get from the first one. The barbers shop scene was funny but quickly went downhill after that.
Seeing his daughter in the training scene you just knew the path it was taking, to stay in touch with current affairs and stances now found in rehashes of old classics.
After seeing this I felt it was like the black version of Bill and Ted face the music.

2280,krisparish,Movie was a major disappointment,1,14 March 2021,I enjoyed the original Coming to America back in the 80's but to make a sequel 30 years later is just sad. I am guessing the actors ran out of money since their careers are over and needed a boost. This was a major disappointment. Not even 10 minutes into the movie and I had to stop due to lack of interest and boring plot not to mention poor acting.,Coming 2 America
2281,peter_hedelund,Nostalgia trip with very little originality,3,6 March 2021,"What on paper might have appeared to be a laugh out loud comedy sadly turns out to be yet another nostalgia trip sequel with (rehashed) jokes that mostly fell flat, a cliché riddled storyline with very little originality to it and a few blatant politically correct messages thrown into the mix.Had this had a theatrical release, I very much doubt it would have run for very long. It feels like an obvious cash grab with very little new or original to offer audiences.And what is really ironic (minor spoiler ahead) is that in one scene, one of the major characters during a conversation about movies even points out, that Hollywood currently feels like nothing more than superhero-movies and movies trying to cash in on nostalgia.I really WANTED to like this one as I have fond memories of the first movie, although the first movie really only managed to make me chuckle, even back in 1988. This sequel didn't even manage to make me do THAT much.The only redeeming factor here is that we at least get to see a lot of the original cast again and how they look now 33 years on.To me, seeing James Earl Jones and John Amos again - now 90 years old and 81 years old respectively at the time of this review - was a treat. Both have made major contributions to Hollywood cinema and done many characters justice.So in short: Feel free to watch this movie for the nostalgia and revisit Zamunda. But do not expect to get big laughs from this cash grab sequel.",Coming 2 America

2319,mrsvirtuouswoman,FAMILY REUNION: In person for cast and virtual for viewer.,8,5 March 2021,"Like most, I love Coming to America. Ask most Black people -it is easily on their top 5 list of favorite movies or movies you watch most. Ask others, and they've seen the movie at minimum- It's an 80's movie and that decade is synonymous with good movies and the birth year of great humans ( 80's baby here!)
Summary: Coming 2 America was highly anticipated and provided reasonable returns because it (1.) Paid beautiful homage to the original. (2.) Entertained and captivated from beginning to end. As with many works of art, I believe it will be more appreciated over time.
The Scenic Route:
Coming 2 America's lofty anticipation was an expression of the cultural impact of the original film. The original film continues to maintain a noticeable presence in current trends, references, and customs- it's woven into Black culture both implicitly and explicitly. So much so, it's on the explicit Black card initial application check list. Coming to America is GREATNESS! Coming 2 America reimagines the greatness because it pays beautiful homage to the original and it's entertaining from beginning to end.
Coming 2 America respects and pays homage to Coming to America because it stays true to the original themes, main story line, high entertainment value, hilarious sound bites, and cast. If you are still alive thirty plus years later- at minimum you're featured. That's amazing in today's time with so many fall outs, etc. It shows the creators deliberate attempt to respect as many aspects of the original film as possible. It also shows the love and admiration even exists for the cast. The film reimagines many scenes from the original. It's nostalgia from beginning to end. It's a great movie because it stayed true to the original despite a modern renovation. The film was a family reunion for the original cast and the viewer- we just attended virtually as we do with everything now.
""Morgan F#$^÷& Freeman""- I screamed that when he made a cameo. How impressive to have Two of the greatest voices of all times in a film together- in the same scene. The cameos are crazy and frequent. The casting was amazing. Eddie Murphy and Wesley Snipes is PURE entertainment! Their combination on anything will be golden. The film has a pronounced theme like another great film, Harlem Nights, of incorporating relevant comedy actors of the time. The comedy is not ""riveting or thought provoking"" but it's clear comedy. Standing alone, it wouldn't be very funny - In context with the film, it's literally laugh out loud as I found myself doing this through out the movie- both times I watched it. Yep, I watched it back to back. ( Watching it again today. It was that good and I am deliberate about supporting Black films.) My watching the film twice really cemented the lasting entertainment value because I found myself captivated again without growing tired. That's one of the markings of a great film- you can watch it multiple times and be enthralled.
Cons: The wardrobe was grand in some scenes and bland in others. I wish it was more consistent. The film moved fast but that's most films these days. Lastly, I'm still becoming accustomed to this new acting that's almost like ""deliver your lines but look like you're trying to keep from laughing. "" It presents with less seriousness. This appears to be something exclusive to Eddie Murphy as he did this in Dolemite as well.
For those who didn't like it, watch it again.
Coming 2 America was good.
With time and a cultural interlacing, we may grow to be as fond of it as we are of the original. It may one day be a qualifying Black card inquiry.💜",Coming 2 America

I'm sure that has to with the directing. Poor cinematography, bad cuts unnecessary popular culture references. Humor that doesn't land, bad use of stereotypes! Horrible story. Poor character development! And overall unbelievability and cartoonishess.And the worst part, unlike Coming to America, they introduced the generic African Hollywood accent. And the unnecessary references to Wakanda and badly representing African culture! This was horrible. How can you take something so good and destroy if! Aaaaaah! Why? The movie doesn't even know what it wants to be!The only good thing about the movie is Wesley Snipes and nostalgia of the original. And maybe for a neutral it might be watchable. But aaaagh!

2330,ctg-52589,Masterpiece,10,6 March 2021,"De principio a fin no paras de reir. Sí, el argumento es simple, pero eso es lo de menos. Lo importante es echarte unas risas con los mil guiños a la película original. Y sobretodo me gusta el rollo actual que le han puesto.
Ojo que hay escena post-creditos. No os la perdáis.",Coming 2 America
2331,r_minnis,Not funny,3,7 March 2021,Had high hopes for this film as I loved the original but unfortunately they spent too much time on being p. c and not nearly enough on being funny.,Coming 2 America
2332,davidnavaro,Product placement movie,4,5 March 2021,"Not funny. Not comparable to the first one at all with a poor storyline, script.",Coming 2 America
2333,agruss,Overhyped and very disappointing,2,8 March 2021,Happens to a lot of sequels..even after that many years of the original (which I have watched countless times) This one? Forgettable even after viewing just once. They simply tried WAY to hard and ..it was not a good try. Terrible story from beginning to end. Good looking actors and some funnys but...not worth the wait. Not even close. For those who loved the ORIGINAL (like me) this one will be painful. Not worth my time....on another note: Leslie Jones OWNED that movie !,Coming 2 America
2334,mscoupon,Terrible,2,13 March 2021,I should have known not to expect much when I saw that the movie was free. The trailer was better. They should have left well enough alone. It was a great disappointment. I gave an extra star because the last few minutes of the movie was funny.,Coming 2 America
2335,evanmaxw,Excellent sequel,9,8 March 2021,"Hollywood has always had trouble making sequels, part of the problem is people want it to be as good or better then the original. Unfortunately they wanted to make this movie nostalgic and different at the same time, which leads to a divided fanbase, it wasn't going to win any awards but it is a delight to see and an achievement in unnecessary sequels.",Coming 2 America

2339,ruben_ramstien_ramirez,Not as corny as originally thought,7,5 March 2021,Movie was very entertaining do not read the negative press on this. Better that I expected it has its corny was but still very entertaining. Watch and give a chance,Coming 2 America
