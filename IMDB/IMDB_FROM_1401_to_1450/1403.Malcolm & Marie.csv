0,Calicodreamin,And thats on toxic relationships,5,9 February 2021,"A solid movie in a lot of ways, good acting, interesting cinematography, and some great monologues. Though it just didn't do it for me to watch people yell and be nasty for two hours.",Malcolm & Marie
1,blanbrn,An in the moment type film that challenges life and love.,5,11 February 2021,"""Malcolm and Marie"" done in black and white is clear a discussion and conversation like film that's in the moment and it challenges thought as life and love collide. It involves a director Malcolm(John David Washington) who after the night of one of his movie premieres returns home for dinner with his girlfriend Marie(Zendaya) and the night turns into many things from loud words to passion to hope and doubt. The acting and on screen chemistry between the two is tense and great as both of their emotions spill out as they question their sanity and the meaning of love and their current state of being together. The movie may not be everyone's cup of tea still it's thought provoking and makes one see how love, doubt, passion, and life all clash in one.",Malcolm & Marie
2,Cineanalyst,Who's Afraid of the Film Critic?,8,6 February 2021,"This is a fascinating one to read reviews for, including, if not especially, the ones with which I disagree. I think that's because ""Malcolm & Marie"" is explicitly about the creation and appreciation of cinematic art. The two-hander, one-house lockdown set (made as it was during the pandemic) talkfest takes place after the eponymous couple return home on the night of the premiere of Malcolm's debut film, which he wrote and directed. Their series of monologues--organized almost as if they were part of a formal debate, each talking at length largely uninterrupted and each taking time to formulate rebuttals--begin and end over his neglecting to thank Marie, herself a former actress turned ""muse,"" in his public remarks at the premiere. Another focal point of the couple's arguments is an LA Times review of the unseen film-within-the-film. Indeed, the review makes some similar criticisms that have been leveled against ""Malcolm & Marie,"" over authenticity, authorship, gender, race, stylistic choices. It's an argument about artistic values, within the film and continued in reviews of it.I'm a sucker for this sort of reflexive construction. Initially, or instinctively, I had the urge to dismiss it, though, which some others seem to have, as an artsy and self-indulgent stagy exercise in overwrought overacting on black-and-white celluloid. A lot like in some ways two recent filmed plays, both of which I also liked, ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" and ""One Night in Miami"" (both 2020). All three are unrealistic and dialogue heavy in their own ways where actors are sometimes playing ideas or arguments more than they are characters, and they're all artistically reflexive debates about art. ""Malcolm & Marie,"" however, is more cinematically designed than them, while in form highly reminiscent of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" (adapted from the play in 1966), with so much attention given to composition and the highlighting of that by its unusual nature as a modern black-and-white film. It's also focused on film--down to the celluloid vs digital debate--whereas the other recent movies are more about music or other media.Regardless of whether this is semi-autobiographical of writer-director Sam Levinson's marriage, as filtered through actors John David Washington and Zendaya, and all the gender and racial issues that brings up with a white man telling the story of black characters, one female, within the film the neat suggestion is that it's making itself: that it's the result of the writer-director character, Malcolm, and actress, Marie, having made it themselves--and that it, too, is about talking about a prior film that's also semi-biographical. It's a multi-layered narrative mise-en-abyme. On top of that, the gorgeous high-contrast black-and-white cinematography is often framed through the home's many windows, creating another framing within the already-existent frame of the film--a visual mise-en-abyme alluding to the fact that this is a film. I like, too, how most of the score is diegetic.Of course, this review is a reflection of how I interpret the film and approach cinema in general, while others may be more interested in discussing character deficiencies, the supposed realism, or socio-political issues and especially race, if they don't dismiss it out of hand as artsy, self-indulgent, etc. All valid criticisms, more or less, and I even agree with them in part, but every time a diatribe verged on obnoxious or at least exhausting, it's turned around, just as Malcolm and Marie go tit-for-tat in their verbal abuse and, then, to shared joy, breaking for a cigarette now and again in between. I found a lot of it to be quite funny. A film where the two characters unnaturally speak in long-winded monologues, as photographed in black and white, but which also plays out largely in real time and is so realistic that the camera follows them to the bathroom. Some of Malcolm's anti-academic rants, also for instance, ironically become academic in their criticisms--bringing up race and politics or the male gaze to refute them, as if Levinson were defending against accusations made of ""Malcolm & Marie"" even before it was released. Malcolm's movie criticized for gratuitous nudity while we see Zendaya as Marie in various states of undress, only for Malcolm to point out that if this were a film that could be similarly rebuked. Marie, an actress who may sometimes be acting and as played by a real actress, has her moments, as well, especially at one point when it seems as though the lovers' quarrel has really gone off the rails. It's not whether it's right, or who wins the argument, or even that the picture is profound or pretentious, but it's a thoughtful engagement with film on film.",Malcolm & Marie
3,cruise01,Boring.,5,11 February 2021,"2.5 out of 5 stars.Malcolm and Marie is a pretty bad film that feels like a long bad play that is about a couple that are dealing with there relationship conflict. The plot is about Malcolm (John David Washington) and his girlfriend Marie (Zendaya) coming home after a movie premiere. Trying to deal with a conflict and reflecting a problem that has risen.Director Sam Levingson, Zendaya, and John David Washington coming together during the pandemic shutdown to create a short budget and small film might as well really keep this locked out. It feels like a bad play with a boring story. Showing a couple that is dealing with there problem. Boring script and direction.John David Washington and Zendaya did a good job but there talent was wasted in this film.",Malcolm & Marie
4,zkonedog,"""Thank You""",10,15 February 2021,"Sometimes, the best artistic endeavors come from odd or unplanned circumstances. Spielberg's shark malfunctions in Jaws? It ultimately sets the standard for unseen creepiness. Harrison Ford sick with a cold on the set of Raiders of the Lost Ark? Produces one of the most hilarious/endearing scenes of the entire film. In that same vein, ""Malcolm & Marie"" was created in the midst of a pandemic, thus necessitating only two leads, a stripped-down crew/location, and a rushed process. No time to make everything perfect or obsess over the small details. What results through this uncharacteristic process is an equally uncharacteristic cinematic experience.For a very basic overview, ""Malcolm and Marie"" tells the story of the titular lead characters coming home from Malcolm's (John David Washington) film premiere. While he's bouncing off the walls with energy, wife Marie (Zendaya) seems a bit perturbed. Viewers quickly come to realize that Malcolm forgot to thank Marie in a speech, and that rift sets off an argument that continues deep into the night.On the surface, it might be easy to see this flick as an angry one, or a pretentious one, or even an overly simple one. But it is anything but those things. Instead, it portrays the very human way that individuals communicate (or don't communicate) with each other and how that leads to repressed emotions and a buildup of emotional scar tissue. ""Malcolm & Marie"" rips through such old wounds to be an absolute treatise on how people argue or express emotions through conversation. Sure, not all may be able to put themselves in the exact shoes of a film producer and his insanely glamorous wife, but I can all but guarantee everyone has gone through a similar scenario with a spouse, significant other, parent, sibling, friend, etc. In other words, there is nary a person alive who won't be able to relate to what is transpiring between the two leads.On an even deeper level, director/writer Sam Levinson turns the tables on the characters so many times that by the end, viewers are as stripped to the bone as the arguing couple. For example, at equal points one will be ""in the corner"" or either Malcolm or Marie, but then quickly realize the situation is much more complicated. Fortunately, the end goal here isn't to crown an ""argument winner"". Instead, it is to show what the process looks like and what each party wants at the end of the long night.To accomplish this, terrific acting is needed--and gotten in spades. Washington is equal parts cool and likable, yet also extremely insecure and patronizing. He also delivers a few epic monologues here that remind me of his famous thespian father (Denzel). Zendaya matches him ""blow for blow"", if you will, slowly transitioning from ""don't want to do this right now"" partner to an emotional wreck as many old wounds/suspicions come home to roost. She also has a signature scene that will have you picking your jaw up off the floor.Sadly, all anyone seems to be talking about regarding ""Malcolm & Marie"" is the scene in which Malcolm (echoing a real-life event from Levinson's past) lambasts a critic for her review of his film. A bit of a controversial scene, but even then it portrays many truths wrapped up in a number of insecurities and passions. That's what one always gets with this movie--no hard and fast answers, but rather an emotional wallop that will leave you sorting through it for days after viewing.I truly hope that over time, people begin to see ""Malcolm and Marie"" for what it really is: an utter tour de force on the nature of arguments, relationships, and how difficult it can be to honestly express one's feelings to another. To my mind, there is much award-worthy material within its runtime.",Malcolm & Marie
5,RosanaBotafogo,Disgusting behavior of self-centered scrotum male... Great movie...,8,15 May 2021,"Only I found the scrotum male, ""eating pasta that his girlfriend made, shouting at his girlfriend, and belittling his importance"", and for worse just wanting to eat the girl, let's see if it improves in the second half, at least the soundtrack pleases... It doesn't get better, self-centered, needy, arrogant, it just saved her, it doesn't justify humiliating her; done, and for such there is no forgiveness... Disgusting behavior of self-centered scrotum male... Great movie...",Malcolm & Marie
6,paul-allaer,The thin line between love and hate (but the sum of the parts doesn't add up),6,2 February 2021,"As ""Malcolm & Marie"" (2021 release; 106 min.) opens, the couple arrives home late at night, after Malcolm's latest film has premiered to apparently great buzz. Malcolm is putting on some great music, while Marie starts preparing some mac and cheese. As the conversation turns, we learn that Marie is quite upset with Malcolm as he failed to thank her in his post-movie's speech, despite the film being inspired by her drug addiction in a prior life. It marks the start of a looooong evening...Couple of comments: this is the latest project from Sam Levinson, best known for the HBO TV series ""Euphoria"", starring Zendaya. When ""Euphoria"" shut down production due to COVID-19, he pitched some ideas for a feature film to Zendaya, who eagerly accepted this particular idea. John David Washington equally jumped on it. It all sounded so promising, and when I saw the film's trailer recently, I couldn't wait to see this. Alas, something doesn't quite add up. The biggest shortcoming is without a doubt the script. It's just not equipped to provide 1 hr. and 45 min. of in-depth characters. To be clear: there are only 2 characters in the film. The trajectory of the characters is too obvious: from hot to cold, to hot again, and then to cold again, and at some point you just want to yell ""enough already!"". Check out the long monolgue that Malcolm gives upon reading the LA Times review of his new film ""by that white chick"". I mean, even John David Washington collapses in the film at the end of that rant from sheer exhaustion! But then there are scenes that are very powerful. So in the end it's a bit of a bixed bag, and frankly this feels like a missed opportunity. Please note that the film is shot in B&W, and features an outstanding soundtrack with choice cuts from James Brown, Outcast, and many others. It is also noteworthy that this is touted as the first Hollywood film produced and shot entirely during the COVID-19 pandemic, adhering fully to the COVID restrictions during the movie's production.""Malcolm & Marie"" was self-financed by Sam Levison and his wife (with a minuscule $2.5 million production budget), and then Netflix snapped it up for an eye-popping $30 million. The film was released for a limited theatrical run this past weekend, before then moving on to Netflix in the near future. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at turned out to be a private screening: I was the only person in the theater (and the rest of the theater complex resembled a ghost town). I honestly don't know how movie theaters can operate profitably in the current pandemic. And it's not like this will change any time soon. Meanwhile if you are interested in a relationship drama or are simply a fan of Zendaya or John David Washington, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Malcolm & Marie

While awaiting for the critics review, the two come to a relations about where there relationship is going.Times the movie feels like a play, cause it never leaves the house, and only Malcolm and Marie are the main focus played such conviction by John David Washington and Zendaya. A good character study of these two people. And the black and white part also works, putting a little gritty to it.",Malcolm & Marie
8,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Malcolm & Marie,6,6 February 2021,"6/10 - apart from giving Zendaya and John David Washington an opportunity to brilliantly portray deeply flawed characters, this film seems to lack much purpose",Malcolm & Marie
9,alindsay-al,A Good Film With Fantastic Acting,7,8 February 2021,"This is one of the few films that managed to be filmed during the pandemic and Netflix have now released Malcolm & Marie and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a director and his girlfriend question everything when they return from the premier of his new film.Main Characters
Usually I would split the acting into two categories but considering there are literally only two people in this film it seems logical to just put them both in this section. John David Washington plays Malcolm & Zendaya plays Marie and they are both fantastic here. They literally have to carry this film on their backs and they do it superbly well, they deliver monologues that just keep going and feel like they are very real to them and the story that the characters were going through. When the nominations for the Oscars come out I would be stunned if both of these two aren't nominated for two really, really strong performances that should be seen and appreciated.Story
The story is interesting, it basically is set in one location and sees a night in these two peoples lives and how their relationship basically unravels and come to a head. The strength is in the performances and the way that they get you to grapple onto their characters and the turmoil more then the actual strength of the plot. There are elements that work, but at times at least for me it felt like we were going in circles and were padding for time and I actually think this film could have been more effective with less if that makes sense.Script
The dialogue is well written and it feels very raw and emotional, heck it makes you question if these two should even be together and which one of them is the worst. It allows both Washington & Zendaya to have effective moments and big acting scenes. But I will say this does feel a bit one dimensional, it feels like Washington will have a monologue, then Zendaya will and then rinse and repeat with very little in breaking up the structure.Style
The film is presented in Black & White and I am not exactly sure the reason for this but it was effective to say the least, it just made the film stand out and feel a bit more unique. But this film was too long for me, as I mentioned above I think this film would have been way more effective if it was at least 15mins shorter and really had no filler and hit the queues that it needed.Overall
Overall, this is a good movie that is really well acted. I will say that this is a film that will divide opinion but I think if you want to see a film with really strong acting and intensity then Malcolm and Marie is a decent shout.",Malcolm & Marie

11,yusufpiskin,Masterpiece,8,6 February 2021,"The cinematography was beautiful. The soundtrack was sensational. The dialogue was riveting. The emotions were turbulent.
I genuinely do not understand why this movie has so many negative reviews. Yes, the concept is similar to ""Marriage Story"" and more but is that really a bad thing? We all loved those movies, didn't we?
They took it and made a whole new movie out of it. Filed it in 14 days with a 22 person crew and 2 amazing actors who really know what they were doing.
I'm also happy to see Zendaya in something more mature, even though I love her other characters and productions just as much.
Really great work!!",Malcolm & Marie
12,r96sk,"Not sold on a lot of what this offers, but the acting from Zendaya and John David Washington is absolutely phenomenal",9,5 March 2021,"Not sold on a lot of what this offers, but the acting from Zendaya and John David Washington is absolutely phenomenal - flawless, in fact.The aforementioned duo are truly outstanding, I loved their performances from start-to-finish; whether it the more serious bits or the more amusing parts. Great delivery, best acting I've seen in a film in a while - no word of a lie.As noted at the top, I'm admittedly not fully sure about the rest of the film. I'm definitely not saying it's bad, disappointing or anything but I am unsure about it. Honestly though, the two leads take away any negatives I may have from the production's other departments. They elevate it, for sure.I'd fully recommend checking out 'Malcolm & Marie' - if only for Zendaya and Washington.",Malcolm & Marie
13,andrewchristianjr,TOO MANY REPETITION.,7,15 February 2021,"Zendaya and JDW are amazing in it. The script can feel a bit dialogue heavy and like a screenplay, but it will still make you go through rollercoaster of emotions.

14,masonfisk,DON'T FORGET TO SAY THE RIGHT THING...!,7,18 March 2021,"A recent Netflix release starring John David Washington & Zendaya. Taking place in a rented home during the night, we have our leads Washington, a filmmaker & Zendaya, his on the mend from drugs muse celebrating the reception his latest film has gotten. What starts out as a seemingly joyous celebration soon devolves into a night of accusations, recriminations & regret as Zendaya feels at first she wasn't thanked properly during his speech but then as the verbal scab pulling intensifies she reveals she wanted the coveted role (she is an aspiring actress) which puts Washington on the hot seat. Filmed in gorgeous black & white, writer/director Sam Levinson (Zendaya is front & center on his HBO adaptation series Euphoria) wisely lets the actors eat up the volleys as the words start to fly & sometimes catch metaphorical blood. The two leads are great here showing they're not just one trick ponies but actors of substance willing to go places others won't.",Malcolm & Marie
15,masonsaul,Really good drama,7,28 August 2021,"It can be way too pretentious and theatrical at times but Malcolm & Marie is still a really good drama that's funny, stylish and extremely intimate with some insightful things to say about the film industry. John David Washington and Zendaya are both incredible with fantastic chemistry. Sam Levinson's direction is really good, it's beautifully filmed and well paced. The black and white aesthetic choice really works and the soundtrack is excellent.",Malcolm & Marie
16,jadepietro,Well Acted but Lacking in Authenticity,7,7 February 2021,"IN BRIEF: Fine acting covers up some flaws in the story department in this well directed two character drama.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) After a successful movie premiere, filmmaker Malcolm Elliott and his girlfriend Marie return home to ""discuss"" the events of the evening, or more so, their imploding relationship. It seems he made the ultimate public faux pas: a glaring omission of not thanking his beloved for her undying support. The verbal fireworks are lit in Sam Levinson's two character drama. Malcolm and Marie. However it appears that director/ writer also forgot to thank Edward Albee too.Now if you are planning to do a two person drama, then you best have a script filled with thought-provoking dialog and a duo of actors who know their craft. Kinda to the former, a definite yes to the latter.
After all, words become the action in this scenario. In fact, they matter the most. Malcolm & Marie loses track of that fact as the couple bicker and yell and their topics range from ex-girlfriends, white privilege, mediocrity, and famous film directors with much talk in-between about love and hate. This marathon plays out in real time, so this nearly two hour gabfest exhaust rather than enlightens. After all, when was the last time you made your significant other feel insignificant by calmly saying, ""I can snap you like a twig"". Such sweet talk!Filmed during the COVID quarantine, this film maximizes its social distancing in showing an unhappy couple with deep-rooted commitment issues. It also keeps its distance from its moviegoers, which is not a good thing. Throughout this long morning hour session, our temperamental filmmaker and his ex-addict girlfriend throw themselves into sadomasochistic behaviors that would rival George or Martha, but the payoff feels incomplete.Mr. Levinson sets-up his drama with various rants about art, guilt, and shame in his first act and finally questioning authenticity in his second act, a quantity that his film lacks. Often, the dialog seems contrived and manipulative. The film never builds to a satisfying conclusion and one wonders why these two would ever stay in this combative relationship. He is so narcissistic and egotistical with definite anger issues; she is unable to admit her own flaws and jealousy issues.Now, dear moviegoer, you would think I could not recommend this film from my words thus far...but I do. Although some of you would not enjoy this movie at all, there is much to admire here. Mr. Levinson solidly directs his fight scenes with style, even if he sometimes fumble with his wordplay. This is not to say that his screenplay doesn't have insight and bravado. It does, many times over. But where the film truly excels is in its quieter moments and its use of a soundtrack playlist that helps convey the emotional wreckage this couple endures. The fluid b&w cinematography by Marcell Rév is some of the best you will see this year. And foremost is the talented cast of two who are building quite an impressive resume.John David Washington has the more difficult role as Malcolm. As written, his unpleasant character is angry and angrier. Not a wide range, but he does rage very well. He also brings some charisma and nuance to his underwritten role. This is his personal best and one is greatly encouraged to see more of his future work. Zendaya has the better written part as both victim and attacker. She creates a vivid figure, showing her character's determination and vulnerability. Her final seven minute ""thank you"" speech is mesmerizing and the actress may earn some accolades just for that speech alone. Both actors handle the movie's frequent lengthy monologues most astutely and their chemistry together makes the film more palpable.Like that proverbial glass of water, Malcolm and Marie asks its philosophic questions about life, but yet the debate remain unanswered. Is it half empty, half full...or all wet? (GRADE: B-)NOTE: See the recent drama, Marriage Story (2019), for a definitive film on this subject very done well. It's sheer poetry.",Malcolm & Marie
17,richard-1787,"Few movies have held me like this one, but it is often a very painful experience",9,6 February 2021,"First, so it doesn't get lost in the rest of this review, let me make it clear that this movie offers two painfully first-rate performances that will rip your emotional guts out. I've seen ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" several times, and I have to say that this movie is even more gut-wrenchingly powerful and well acted than that masterpiece.It also comes off as a lot more ""authentic"" - a word played with a lot n this movie. While I like WAOVW a lot, the dialogue is very often very theatrical. Here, while there is also dialogue that sounds as if it is being recited from a stage play - Malcom's remarkable speech, delivered half in the kitchen and half in the garden, that drops the names of MANY famous movie directors and script writers, all at remarkable speed, for example - that is less often the case.But this movie also plays with what we perceive to be natural. Perhaps the most remarkable instance of that is the scene where Marie presses the carving knife on the tile floor while truly terrifying Malcolm. You hang on every word of it, terrified of what she might do - only to discover that she is ""acting,"" making the point - very well - that sometimes you cannot tell when a person is using real emotions to act and when they are just expressing ""authentic"" emotion. Elsewhere in the movie Malcolm describes that as the difference between creating a work of art and just making a video of oneself emoting and then posting it on YouTube.That is brought home yet again at the end when we see that this movie was written and directed by a young white man, Sam Levinson, a point for which Levinson prepared us during Malcolm's garden-kitchen speech when the character asks what two Jewish men, David Selznick and Ben Hecht, could have had to contribute to Gone with the Wind. (A great deal, evidently.)Watching two people who have feelings for each other rip each other's hearts out is not fun - though Marie at one point says that audiences love to watch it. But when the script is good and the acting and directing first-rate, it is a powerful experience. I strongly recommend this movie, but only to those in a good enough mood that it will not drive them into depression.",Malcolm & Marie
18,saadgkhan,"Pretentious, pointless and exhausting",4,6 February 2021,"Malcolm & Marie - C+ (Flawed but Worthy)Zendaya was phenomenal in Euphoria, and I was exciting to see her in her first major solo lead in a movie. However, she delivered but the movie is just outright pointless and exhausting. Two people yelling for around 100 minutes, playing music, smoking and cooking that's all you get. You wait for something to happen but it never does they fight, take a break then fight again.John David Washington is becoming bit of a disappointment, he was great in BlackKKlansman but since then his boring uncharismatic turn in Tenet and now here with Over the Top performance makes you wonder about his choices as an actor. A good actor should be good in anything regardless of the director but he just can't hold on to his own.Sam's Assassination of the Nation was over the top but fun timepass which lead to Euphoria but here he went 2 steps back instead of forward. A pointless dialogue bonanza winning no accolades or appreciation. Good they get to make a movie in a pandemic but it's we who have to suffer. Things we do for ZENDAYA!!!",Malcolm & Marie
19,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Has its moments for sure, but can't quite sustain itself through all 106 minutes",5,10 February 2021,"Probably would have been better as a short film, because it really started to drag and feel a little repetitive in the second half.It's a decent effort to do one of those one-location, limited cast kind of movies, but it is let down in the writing, with some dialogue that feels very overwritten at points, and a lot of scenes that feel like they hammer home the same point again and again. You could argue it's intentional, but I'm sure there would be ways to have that repetition as a theme without making the film feel like a bit of a chore to sit through after about the 50-minute mark.That being said: even though the black and white cinematography doesn't seem to serve a concrete purpose, it does look fairly nice. And the film is saved by its two performances, who do surprisingly good work with a screenplay packed with lines (and whole scenes) that would be difficult to act convincingly.Overall, it's far from terrible, and I did get a fair bit of enjoyment out of the first half and small parts here and there in the second, but it doesn't quite sustain itself well enough to justify the feature-length runtime, in my opinion.",Malcolm & Marie

21,Sir_AmirSyarif,Stylistic but exhausting and ultimately meaningless,5,10 February 2021,"While the script is rife with monologues and exhausting rants about politics, art, and criticism, Sam Levinson's 'Malcolm & Marie' has little meaningful to say about anything. The movie starts out solid on its first 20 minutes, but then the conversation and conflict between characters just go in circles for another hour and a half. The performances are compelling, the black and white cinematography is stunning, but nothing can save this movie from its terrible writing.",Malcolm & Marie
22,kjproulx,Very Repetitive with Stellar Performances,6,9 February 2021,"When it comes to one-location films, I'm usually cautiously optimistic every time. When this type of film is done right, it can really shine and be memorable for the filmmaking techniques involved throughout. The reason I'm usually cautious is due to the fact that there have been multiple films that don't do enough to hold your interest, leaving you bored with the scenery over and over again. Now streaming on Netflix, Malcolm & Marie is one of the latest films to take place entirely at one location. While it's very far from perfect, here's why I at least admired it so much.After the premiere of his first feature film, Malcolm returns to his rental home with his girlfriend Marie. Feeling high and mighty after the stellar response, his cockiness gets the better of him. This in turn releases an endless number of thoughts about each other. Essentially, this film is 106 minutes of arguing. That may not seem appealing, but it all comes down to whether or not you believe these characters, and I absolutely did.John David Washington has proven time and time again that he's a force on camera. Whether you're talking about BlacKkKlansman or smaller movies like Monsters and Men or The Old Man and the Gun, I've just loved his commitment to each role. On top of his great performance once again here, I think his co-star Zendaya actually stole the show from him on multiple occasions. Other appearing in Spider-Man films and being very solid in The Greatest Showman, I hadn't watched any of her earlier television roles as a child actress. It wasn't until her starring role in the HBO series Euphoria that I then told myself I need to see every future project that includes a performance by her. She has really come a long way as an actress and her performance in Malcolm & Marie felt incredibly raw and I loved every second of it.Where I feel this film falls apart is actually in the greatness of these performances and the stellar filmmaking overall. From the unique cinematography by Marcell Rev to the great direction by Sam Levinson (both of whom worked on Euphoria with Zendaya), Malcolm & Marie is simply too long of a film for the material being presented. It takes place over one night and follows a couple arguing in different rooms. Everything about the movie itself is elegant, but by the time it reached the second act, I started getting hints of Déjà Vu. I was sucked in by the camerawork and performances in the first act, I even liked where the movie ended, but certain conversations or things the characters were doing just started to feel incredibly repetitive. It felt like different versions of the same scene were happening over and over again.Overall, Malcolm and Marie is a massive showcase for how talented of a director Sam Levinson has the potential of being and also that John David Washington and Zendaya are both incredible performers. I feel disappointed in retrospect because there was so much potential on the table. It's not that the film fell apart, it's that after a while, there wasn't anywhere new to take this film on an intellectual level. Things are said later on in the film as a revelation, which I felt was already implied without saying a word earlier on. This movie was very confused with the notion of show-don't-tell. In the end, for film lovers like myself, it's absolutely worth a watch, but I really don't believe it was as good as it could've been.",Malcolm & Marie
23,msbreviews,"Malcolm & Marie boasts two phenomenal performances, but its complicated screenplay and characters push me to the negative side.",4,9 February 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)At the time of this review, Malcolm & Marie is already dividing critics worldwide, which is far from being surprising, having in mind its expectedly provocative premise. Being a film critic isn't exactly an easy task, especially when it comes to deal with public opinion. In most cases, when one reaches a high level of success, that always comes with a heavy dose of offensive tweets and personal attacks, particularly when the author's opinion contradicts the audience's response. So, I was hoping that Sam Levinson would not contribute to the dozens of misconceptions surrounding film criticism and hundreds of conspiracy theories regarding journalists of the respective area...Unfortunately, the extremely exaggerated, borderline offensive, over-the-top monologues - kind word for rants - delivered by Malcolm (John David Washington) are simply more wood thrown to the already devastating fire. What starts as a surprisingly rational, thought-provoking comment on how (some) critics tend to make movies about something these aren't attempting to be - mainly emphasizing a non-existent political or racial message - quickly evolves to scenes featuring a childish, immature, self-absorbed behavior from the male protagonist, who blindly attacks hypothetical reviews from, in his opinion, horrible critics. Even though this is somewhat of a niche subject for the general audience, it's still a negative contribution to a challenging problem film critics face every day.I've read the following comment more than a couple of times already: ""Sam Levinson is using a Black actor to transmit his white male director's frustrations on the industry's reviewers"". In my opinion, whoever wrote something similar to this is falling into the exact same error Malcolm aggressively accuses critics of doing: reading too much into it, and once again, bringing race to a discussion where it doesn't belong. It doesn't really matter if the screenplay is written by a frustrated Levinson who decided to let out his thoughts about film criticism or by someone else entirely. Ultimately, the characters are one of the main pillars of any movie, and sadly, they're my main issue with the whole story.Despite the prologue above that I couldn't help not writing, Malcolm & Marie focuses on the toxic relationship of the two unlikable protagonists. The adjectives used in the last sentence are hardly untrue. Malcolm and Marie spend almost the entire runtime in a tiresome, exhausting, headache-inducing cycle of incredibly exaggerated fights followed by a temporary reconciliation by making out for a couple of minutes before the next big argument begins. As soon as I finished the film, Marriage Story came to my mind, and I vividly remember tearing up when the main characters had that massive fight. Why did I feel so bothered and uncomfortable with Malcolm and Marie then? Because of their personalities.Malcolm is nothing more than a cocky, egocentric, self-indulgent filmmaker who believes he's the king of the world now that he delivered a good movie. Pride and arrogance are separated by a thin line, but Malcolm definitely incorporates the arrogant persona who can't even show signs of gratitude when positive reviews come in - instead delivers another rant on how the respective author didn't understand his film. On the other hand, Marie (Zendaya) starts as an apparently nice, hardworking, lovable young woman who just got stuck with the wrong man, seemingly working as the equilibrium point in their relationship. I do feel sorry for a lot of things that happened to her. However, Marie quickly demonstrates that she's far from being a perfect girlfriend.Despite being much more tolerable and less unlikable than Malcolm, Marie carries unforgivable mistakes from her past and shows an inability to accept that Malcolm might have drawn inspiration from someone else. With constant attempts at victimization and a certain amount of jealousy, Marie is the trigger for most of the arguments that come up out of nowhere each time the two reconcile. In the end, this is the reason why I felt so much more emotionally invested in the protagonists of Marriage Story: I deeply cared about these characters and their respective lives. Not only I understood what drove them apart, but I could actually relate to some of it. Malcolm might have made a beautiful movie partially based on his relationship with Marie, but it's still a toxic, damaging romance that no one should ever need to deal with.Even though the before-mentioned problems are indeed heavy negatives, Malcolm & Marie still possesses a lot of qualities worthy of deep appreciation. Levinson might share the same views on film criticism as Malcolm, but his talent as a director is undeniable. His brilliant use of excruciatingly long takes plays a significant role in elevating the intensity and attention levels of every dialogue and monologue. Marcell Rév's cinematography - who previously worked with Levinson in Euphoria - is either based on tracking shots to follow each character across the never-ending halls and rooms of the house or static images to let the actors shine in their line deliveries. Rév waits for just the right moment to finally move the camera near the character after extensive, uncut minutes of impressive work from the movie's absolute standouts: the actors.John David Washington's performance in Tenet wasn't universally loved, and even though I really enjoyed his display, I didn't know where his career would go from there. Well, his portrayal of Malcolm may be a bit too over-the-top for some people's taste, but despite my despise for the character, only a blind viewer would not value Washington's outstanding interpretation. In a surprisingly more physical display than I anticipated, Washington literally offers his entire body and voice to his character, not forgetting a single facial expression or body movement. As uncomfortable as his rants on film criticism are, I have to show appreciation for the actor's ability to actually make me feel like that.Nevertheless, this is Zendaya's show. In fact, I won't be surprised by the inevitable nominations coming her way. For someone who never watched Euphoria or only has her performance as MJ in Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home as an example, her portrayal of Marie will surely shock many viewers. From the incredible control of subtle emotions certain scenes ask for to the extremely captivating monologues - something both actors tackle superbly - Zendaya delivers her career's best performance in a feature film. An emotionally powerful display that I won't forget so soon. A final praise to Labrinth's score, which plays a meaningful part in the storytelling.Malcolm & Marie is technically impressive - gorgeous cinematography and impactful score - boasting two phenomenal performances, but its complicated screenplay and characters push me to the negative side. From the overly exaggerated, almost offensive rants on film criticism and the area's professionals to the tiresome, over-the-top cycle of fight-reconciliation, Sam Levinson's undeniable talent as a director is overpowered by the two incredibly unlikable protagonists who are mutually damaging each other in their unquestionably toxic relationship. Despite the exceptionally captivating effort from John David Washington and especially Zendaya, who delivers a career-best interpretation, the feeling of discomfort and distress never goes away. Malcolm is a completely intolerable, arrogant filmmaker, and even though I genuinely felt sorry for Marie at one point, the latter eventually proves that she's far from being a better person. Since one of its central topics of discussion is a bit too niche for general audiences, it will probably find its commercial success through Netflix. Personally, it's my first major disappointment of 2021.Rating: C",Malcolm & Marie
24,Alexander_Blanchett,A Thin Line between Love and Hate,7,5 February 2021,"They fight - they try to have sex - they fight - they try to have sex - they fight - they try to have sex. Thats the whole movie in a nutshell. And you as the audience wonder if they end up having sex or not. That's the plot.
Ok that was really a very shallow view on this film as there is indeed more it tells but its nothing really new. We had that intimate look at a couple's relationship a lot of times before and there is not much to add. Sometimes the film feels like an extended version of the fight scene between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in ""Eyes Wide Shut"". We learn a lot about the two characters lives, their past and they emotions. There are a few heartbreaking moments that really make it worthwhile. The acting is great, too which is the biggest bonus the film has. Without John David Washington and Zendaya there wouldn't be much left except for an excellent cinematography. But the screenplay is not really that thrilling. It just plays around with various topics of fights, a couple that questions their relationship, their motives. And all of that. Again, had that a dozens time before. The acting and style is what makes it special. The direction by Sam Levinson is also not too shabby. John David Washington is great and shows another range of his immense talent. This is also the film that hopefully gives Zendaya the respect as an actress she deserves. Both are fantastic, both have showed scenes. Both play off each other, its hard to say who is better, but in the essence we see a great showcase of two actors who will have a long and exciting career in Hollywood, who are about to become the leading actors of a new generation.
All in all not a bad film but nothing too thought provoking.",Malcolm & Marie
25,ronakkotian,Extraordinary acting in a film that ends up getting repetitive,6,6 February 2021,"*WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS*When I heard John David Washington and Zendaya were gonna be together in this film, I got excited. Despite their brilliant performances, I have mixed feelings towards this film.Malcolm & Marie takes place during one night where Malcolm and Marie's relationship is tested after Malcolm's movie premiere as they wait for critics' reviews.First of all, I have to admit it's impressive how they were able to make this film during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the restrictions they had to place to keep the set safe and its low budget, Malcolm & Marie is a gorgeous looking film that features fantastic performances from both actors. I've been rooting for John David Washington ever since I first saw him in BlacKkKlansman and here he delivers one of his best performances yet. At times I did feel he went over the top but for the most part, he put a lot of passion and emotion into his character. Zendaya is easily the biggest surprise for me in this film. I haven't seen her act extremely well before until now. Her character is much more subtle than Washington's but she deserves every ounce of praise she gets for her portrayal as Marie. Zendaya is certainly the highlight of the film.Whilst the performances may be strong, I have issues with the story itself. The film is essentially a 1 hour 45 minute argument and after a certain point it becomes repetitive. After a point, I understood the structure and that's where I didn't engage with the film as well as I did at the start. They fight, then they make up for a short time, then they fight, and then make up again. The formulà became repetitive and dragged the film as a result. The film is very gorgeous to look at and I feel the black and white suited the film well. The camerawork is also stellar. There is a fantastic one take sequence towards the beginning which gave the actors a lot of room to work with. Sam Levinson's script has a lot to say. It's evident that there is a lot of anger built up inside Levinson that he wants to get off his chest especially during a scene where Washington goes on a long rant bashing a critic. Levinson's film talks about relationships, critics and filmmaking through its runtime which does promote for interesting discussions. At the same time, there are moments where the dialogues feel like they're being read off a page instead of sounding natural and that's not due to the performances but more on the script being overwritten. Like Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and One Night in Miami, this film does also feel more like a play than a film.Malcolm & Marie is one of those films that will split audiences. There are aspects to appreciate but had Levinson put more time in perfecting the script, Malcolm & Marie could have been better.",Malcolm & Marie
26,trinaboice,Brilliant piece of art but not everyone will enjoy it,10,1 February 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Brilliantly written and directed by Sam Levinson, this is one of the very first movies to be written, directed, and produced during the Covid-19 pandemic! The entire movie was filmed in black and white, a visual symbol that speaks volumes, making this movie a piece of modern art. The film is already earning Oscar buzz for the film and the actors...all well deserved.John David Washington plays a filmmaker on the night of his premiere. As a film critic myself, his character's perspective and comments gave me a lot to think about. He and Zendaya's character talk about film, love, relationships, gratitude, politics, and art.THINGS I LIKED:
The fact that this movie only has 2 cast members is extremely impressive, especially considering how compelling they are to watch for almost 2 whole hours.
I'm such a huge fan of John David Washington and thought he was stellar in Blackkklansman. He's also EXCELLENT in this film. Did you know he's the son of Academy Award winner Denzel Washington? Not surprising. There's a scene at about the 40-minute mark that was truly amazing. It immediately reminded me of some of the unbelievable monologues his father gave in the movie Fences. It also reminded me of Adam Driver's jaw-dropping performance in Marriage Story. John David also joined the team of producers on this film.
Zendaya is only 24 years old and is already so incredibly accomplished in cinema. For being 12 years younger than John David, she sure did match his performance in this movie. I felt like she really grew up and gave an extremely impressive performance that puts her on the map. Because the movie was filmed during the pandemic, she did all of her own makeup, costume design, and set dressings. She also joined John David as a producer for the film. In fact, she was the one who contacted Sam Levinson to kickstart this project. They grew close during their time together filming Euphoria and continued to collaborate artistically. They all should be very proud of this work.
The direction and camera work were artistic masterpieces. Truly stunning.
I love that the movie was in black and white. Every frame is immaculate. There is mention of the classic black and white movie Citizen Kane. I think Orson Welles would have been proud of this film.
Fantastic one-shot scenes.
I thought the references to The Lego Movie movie were hilarious.
There are so many insightful comments about cinema. If you watch this movie, consider watching it with captions turned on and the pause button in your hand so you can really analyze and savor each flavorful line.
The Cee-Lo song that played during the end credits was perfect when he sings ""There's a fine line between love and hate."" The song is from the Outkast track Liberation
You will feel all the feels, especially if you've ever been in a romantic relationship.
Word has it that part of this movie's story was inspired by when Sam Levinson forgot to thank his wife during his speech at the Sundance Film Festival. Ouch.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Some viewers won't like watching a new film in black and white.
When the actors whisper to each other, it's hard to hear what they're saying.
I hate seeing Zendaya smoke, ruining the health of her cute body.
The constant fighting is exhausting. Sooooo much yelling.
I felt like I was being physically assaulted with all of that crude, violent language.
I wish Zendaya hadn't been in her underwear for most of the movie. Then again, I understand the visual portrayal of vulnerability.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
You see a woman sit on a toilet and later in a bathtub, but her private parts are covered. Later you see her in skimpy, revealing underwear.
Profanity, crude language, and sooooo many F-bombs
The ""N"" word is used several times.
Kids will be completely bored. It's really NOT a movie kids should watch anyway.
Lots of smoking and drinking

27,Xavier_Stone,Atrociously bad. Bascially 2 people arguing. Horrendous camera work.,1,18 February 2021,"From the first 5 minutes you can tell that this is a movie trying to impress you. The black and white film to make it look edgy and the non stop dialogue to create a sense of a face pace. Ok fine, I was able to accept it and continued to watch.Then at about the 10 minute mark my eyes started to ache, like I was wearing a pair of coke bottle glasses. I paid attention more and realized that the camera is continually 6"" to 12"" from the characters at times. The entire face is filled by the screen when they are kissing. And so on, and so on. Always with the zoom.There is no reason for this. Writer/Director Sam Levinson is just trying to create something different and it fails incredibly bad.I'm not sure how anyone doesn't notice this, it's impossible to miss once you see it.",Malcolm & Marie
28,jordan2240,The better move from a Washington this year,8,11 February 2021,"My wife and I happened to catch a program on PBS radio where this movie was being discussed, and the people (I believe they were critics) who were talking about it absolutely trashed it. But it got our curiosity up, so, with low expectations, we gave it a watch. I guess we just aren't as smart as the critics, because we both enjoyed it. None of the criticisms the critics made (i.e. overacting, stiff acting, poor dialog) was valid to us. I'm wondering if one particular scene that was rather critical of a movie critic simply ticked the real critics off, so they were trying to exact their revenge.Anyone who's been in a serious relationship could likely relate to the feelings the actors portrayed, and the amount of dialog they needed to perform was astounding. For us, even though the movie featured only 2 people in a conversation over the course of one long night, it held our attention. Certainly this film was much better than the most recent one Denzel gave us. Count us among those who enjoyed this.",Malcolm & Marie
29,sweidman-28016,Great Despite the General Criticisms,8,14 February 2021,"""It's not just about you forgetting to thank me, Malcolm. It's about how you see me. And how you view my contribution.""I've waited a little bit to write this review. The first reactions were all positive, then critics became divided with it, and now the general public thinks it's just ok. Malcolm & Marie may not have captivated all audiences, but I for one found it to be a well-done film. The premise follows a filmmaker returning home with his girlfriend following a celebratory movie premiere as he awaits what's sure to be imminent critical and financial success. The evening suddenly takes a turn as revelations about their relationships begin to surface, testing the strength of their love. How I like to describe it is think of the worst argument from Marriage Story and stretch it out for almost two hours. Also add some Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? into the mix. Sam Levinson has made a name for himself with the success of Euphoria. Here, he seizes the opportunity to discuss relationships, worth, and critics. Malcolm & Marie was one of the first films to be shot during the pandemic. The story works in its favor since it only calls for two actors and one location. Zendaya and John David Washington are electric together. We see both the best and worst of the characters. Zendaya gives an award worthy performance. She and Levinson have a great understanding of each other that brings the best of her acting out. And John David Washington gives an excellent performance as well. I love seeing how the two quickly have risen as actors. The amount of work put in by the two is outstanding. Some monologues last minutes long. It's crazy how they could memorize all of that and deliver breathtaking scenes. Literally, I felt like I had to hold my breath the hold time with how intense it gets.What I love about the screenplay is how it doesn't take a side. Obviously, there are a few scenes where it focuses on the needs of one over the other, but you can see both sides. There's also a deepness to it that some may not see. Many will view this as a long argument, and I get that. I do think it uses every minute to voice some sort of topic whether it's about a character or pertaining to real life. The part that I thought was a bold move is kind of bashing critics. As you might imagine, some critics didn't like that. But if you listen to what it has to say, it's all true. I will say there are some flaws within the screenplay. For one, it does feel repetitive at times. There's a distinct setup of arguing followed by the two making-up someway. And that happens multiple times. Also some reaction to their criticism to each other feels strange. For example, John David Washington at one point essentially tells Zendaya how broken she is, and Zendaya just smiles. Accepting something like that felt almost wrong. There are a few instances of this. Also, the beginning of the third act has a very strange scene that feels all too abrupt considering all that has happened. It's resolved quickly but it felt so strange and intense that I didn't know where it would go. The issues I have are about specific parts, but I'd rather not spoil the film.Sam Levinson has an eye for the look of a film or episode. The choice to use black-and-white for one looks gorgeous. It also has a lot to say within the context of the film. Most will realize the basic significance of right-or-wrong to a conversation, but with other topics discussed it only adds to the effectiveness. Also, the house they're in looks phenomenal. It's big and they use the space well. The blocking is fantastic. As a stage play, this would work well. If that was the intention, the cinematic approach is done well. I understand all of the division with the film. Many criticisms that I've seen prove a point that I can get behind also. And some just hate it saying it's too pretentious. However, I will be one to support Malcolm & Marie (and hope that Zendaya could get a nomination for the Oscars even if it's not likely at this point). I can't say that I could recommend this to everyone, but give it a chance and listen to what it has to say.",Malcolm & Marie

Makes you think about filmmaking, writing, but mostly life, love and respect.Zendaya with a mesmerising performance. I didn't believe the hype until today (never watched Euphoria). All the emotions are there. She is perfect balancing the right mood for the right moment, even with few words sometimes. It's a crime if she is not nominated for Oscars. The same crime they are ready to commit with Lindo.John David Washington is almost as good as her, on the best performance of his career. Really great dealing with critics (and wannabe critics, like this site is full of), but also with insecurities, the creative process and all it takes from you.Kick the ass of politically correctness and old and new critics stereotypes about men, women or black people.

31,david-meldrum,"Bold And Truthful, Despite Its Weaknesses",8,30 July 2021,"An old adage of relationships is to never get into a big discussion that's likely to turn into an argument when either or both of you are tired, the hour is late or emotions are running high anyway. The only two characters in this film break that rule - otherwise we wouldn't have a film - and the film charts their forensic examination of each other and their relationships over the course of a late night/early morning after the guy' debut film as director has premiered to great acclaim.It's a strange film, and not necessarily in a bad way; its artificiality is self-aware enough to get by, and it has the fascination of a slow-motion car crash as a whole stack of unaddressed micro and macro aggressions come home to roost. Parts of it do jar - it's strangely episodic, with the transitions signalled by (mostly) diegetic music, but the music is usually far too on the nose even for characters who are deliberately and openly using the music to do some talking for them, and it was sometimes hard for me to see how the transitions from episode to episode worked. I couldn't always see how the characters got from where they'd been to where they were. But maybe that's just relationships; these are people who see only at their worst for the duration of the film. That doesn't make it a chore to spend time with them, but it does make me wonder what either of them really wants from or sees in each other.All that said, it flies by; it's bold, and for all its weaknesses it feels truthful.",Malcolm & Marie
32,coreyjdenford,Meh & Meh,6,5 February 2021,"As we learned from 2019's divorce drama Marriage Story, a true conversation piece is traditionally between two people, there's generally a lot of shouting, debating, arguing and occasionally there's the odd flourish into serenity. It's often cathartic and quite thereputic for two actors with very good chemistry to vent at each other, Marriage Story was successful because of that - one reason why it's lead actors walked away with an Oscar nomination each. Malcolm & Marie is less the success story, more of a flawed conversation caper, though it's two leads aren't the film's main problem as both Zendaya fresh off her Primetime Emmy win for Euphoria and John David Washington who's starting to sound a lot like a young Denzel ever time we see him, their performances are solid, you'll be sold on it just for that alone they have fantastic chemistry almost as good as Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson in the aforementioned Marriage Story. Everything in Malcolm & Marie works, the script is good, the directing is gold and it receives an A+ in acting, but the thing that sinks it is it's less a conversation piece about a couple that's on the verge of braking apart more a thesis on how awful film critics can be, and even the film takes that into context when it leads into venting about white frustration. But other than that this quarantine written and directed film is provocative and seductively stylish that it's such a shame the film is brought down by wrought self indulgence. 3/5.",Malcolm & Marie

Amazing performances by both Washington and Zendaya",5,6 February 2021,"""Malcolm and Marie"" is not really my kind of movie, but I was very curious about it, as is the first production to be ever completed during the pandemic. So I wondered what the director could come up with, considering all limitations that this period bringed.The movie is set during one single night. For the entire length we see a couple going back and forth to the most painful and excruciating fight of their relationship. A lot of deep feelings are involved and the cast managed to portray extremely good the emotional weight of a story that is going to be tested really hard, and that maybe is on the brink. Cast nailed it and I liked both actors. Washington is on fire, he always kept such an intense energy for all scenes, he was dedicated to the role and you can clearly see this. Zendaya was a surprise for me, never heard of her, and even if she is not at the same level of her colleague, she still delivers a convincing acting.The first half of the movie is well conceived and kept me glued on the screen of my TV, but then on the second part it is just too repetitive. The couple fight always on same topics, two monologues portrayed by Malcolm are basically the same, nothing is added. Was it really necessary to make a movie almost two hours long? I think that this could have worked better just with a shorter runtime. The film could have been way more effective if it lasted just a little bit over one hour. It is more than enough to introduce, develop and end the story, At some point I was really wondering when it was going to end.Even though the entire film is set in a house, it feels very dynamic and intense. I suggest to watch it just out of curiosity, but do not expect a masterpiece. I personally liked the fact that was shot in black and white, I think that it just work better in this way, instead of using color.",Malcolm & Marie

Director: Sam Levinson
Starring: Zendaya and John David Washington
Overall rating 64/100
Malcolm and Marie is about a director and his girlfriends relationship which is tested after they return home from his movie premier and await the critics responses. I feel very conflicted over this movie, there was some excellent moments but the movie for me was weighed down by it's significant flaws, so let's get started.First of all, I loved the cinematography, the classic tone the performances and the chemistry between the leads. The movie looked absolutely fantastic, the stylistic choice of making it black and white was an excellent choice, and the set location was truly beautiful, there was just some excellently crafted shots to signify how the characters were feeling in that particular scene, I also loved how classic the movie felt, it felt like it was made in the 60's or 70's with the credits at the beginning and the soundtrack choices it was really refreshing to see. I do have to say that the performances in this movie were absolutely fantastic, they both had heaps of charm and depth to their performances and bought there characters to life in an exciting way, showing great nuance and depth to their performance and different layers to their characters that felt authentic and powerful, and in general they both had excellent on-screen chemistry and bounced off each other excellently on screen, I would gladly see them both work together again.However, my first few negatives would be that there were some repetitive plot points, there was some oddly set up and just unneeded conflict, and the character of Malcolm was not very likeable at all. Due to the movie being very restrictive as it was only set in one location the movie felt very repetitive in places, there was a lot of scenes that were just repeated a lot of the time therefore limiting the movies creative shots and cinematography and just making the film feel not as fresh and creative as perhaps It wanted to be. Also, due to the limited setting a lot of the conflict within the movie felt oddly set up to me, one-minute Malcolm and Marie would really be getting along and then they would walk outside and come back in and start another argument, it just made the pacing very clunky for me and some of the conflict within the movie just felt unnecessary and didn't contribute enough towards the overall plot and depth to both of the characters. I also thought that the character of Malcolm was just very unlikeable, he said some unforgiveable and nasty things to Marie and considering her mental state and the sensitive topics for some of it, Malcolm just came across as nasty and lacked any form of empathy, yes Marie said some hurtful things as well but most of the time she justified and explained why she was saying it and how she was feeling. Malcolm came across as cocky, arrogant, and ungrateful.My final few positives for the movie would be the fantastic script, balance to both of their relationships and the key themes within the movie. The excellent character depth and the development of the plot and characters. The script for this movie for me was the strongest part to Malcolm and Marie, the amount of depth it went into with its characters was astounding, the dialogue was clever and well delivered, with some deep themes on the representation of racism within the media and in film as well as certain aspects of news tabloids and film criticism that really made you think. I thought that the character depth and development of both Malcolm and Marie was truly excellent, this movie laid everything on the table for both these characters, the audience knew every single minor detail to both of the characters and their lives and how they behaved this was well paced out throughout the movie and was an excellent in depth character study of both of these characters. I also loved the balance to both of the characters as well as the themes conveyed to the audience. The movie had an equal balance of showing the flaws to both characters and showing it from both of their perspectives offered a healthy and consistent balance to the movie despite me connecting with and agreeing with what Marie had to say more than Malcolm and having both characters perspectives of the deep themes of the movie was a nice touch offering two different sides to the same issue.My final couple of negatives for the movie that really made it too flawed for me was its dull and emotionally draining tone as well as it's unsatisfying ending. This movie was hard to get through, having repeated arguing for most of the movie with two characters constantly screaming at each other just isn't an exciting premise or idea for an audience to watch, it was emotionally draining, and I had to take a break about halfway through if it had more of a balance of the positive side to their relationship then perhaps it could of worked better but with the amount of arguing in this movie it would have worked better as a short film. I also thought the ending was very unsatisfying in terms of both Malcolm and Marie's arc as a couple and Malcolm's arc. By the end of the movie they should have separated there wasn't any real satisfying closure to their arguing and it just felt like there was too many negative things about their relationship, I felt like the arc for Malcolm was also weak, he apologised but for three seconds it wasn't enough to make his character likeable and he should have been much more willing to try and change and become a better person for Marie but the audience got none of that so therefore it left me very unsatisfied.Overall, Malcolm and Marie boast some great visuals, a well-constructed and deep script highlighting issues with the representation or racism and drug addiction as well as news tabloids in great detail, as well as having some awards worthy performances from John David Washington and Zendaya. However, is too flawed in its repetitive and dull plot that makes it hard to get through, and its flawed structure that left me very unsatisfied with both of the characters relationship, therefore making the film's awards chances very low.",Malcolm & Marie
37,TheCorniestLemur,I'm a Moofie Dyerector,7,14 September 2021,"Oof, where to start with this...This film kind of feels designed to resist people like me complaining about it, because it is one of those ""films about films"" in quite a big way. While it is a very small scale affair about a couple having an argument, there is also a lot of pontificating about the value of critics, what a filmmaker's race can say about their work, and other things like that. It felt like it was daring me to review it. And maybe I would have been slightly intimidated by this, were it not for one thing...It's so excruciatingly obvious that as soon as John David Washington starts one of his rants about critics, it's no longer Malcolm talking, it's Sam Levinson. He's one of the most transparent director stand-in characters I've ever seen. I would also say something about it being a bit weird that he's a white guy having a black character basically represent himself ranting about how not everything he makes is political just because of his race, but I have to admit that seeing as it seems to be part of the point that a director's race shouldn't come into criticism of their work, and that I likely never would have guessed that Sam Levinson isn't black just from watching this, it does make that point pretty well.The transparentness is easily the worst thing about this film to me, but it's still tied in with the dialogue, which this film leans so strongly on, and for the most part, it nails it. Even when it's coming from Sam Levinson and not either of the characters, the dialogue is often brilliant. Sometimes it falls into the trap of sounding too ""filmy"" (no one talks like this, people trying to write good dialogue talk like this), but it's always pretty gripping to hear.Which it would not be at all without Zendaya and John David Washington delivering it, because holy hell these are amazing performances that I wasn't expecting at all. I've only seen Zendaya in the Spider-Man MCU movies, and Tenet wasn't exactly an actor's showcase for JDW, so I wasn't expecting anything nearly this good from either of them. But bloody hell they make this entire film.It's also really well shot and directed. Even though there aren't any shots that made me stand up and proclaim Levinson a visionary, there's a lot of memorable ones, and for some reason I'm a sucker for films set in one location that still manage to make that one location look interesting.And while sometimes it does suffer from the audience's lack of knowledge about what their relationship is like outside of what is shown to us, I wasn't ever bored and found myself genuinely hoping they'd be able to sort out their differences, so I couldn't say it doesn't get you to care about them.But since Sam Levinson doesn't seem to like people like me, he made a film that no one can agree on, so everything I've just said likely means dick. Except for: it's one of those films that you won't know if you'll like until you watch it, so...watch it.",Malcolm & Marie
38,danybur,Much ado About Nothing,6,11 February 2021,"The young couple of Malcolm and Marie (John David Washington and Zendaya) arrive at an impressive house in Malibu. He is a film maker who has just released his debut feature, and everything indicates that it will be a success. She, an actress who has had addiction problems. Both will engage in a series of recriminations and arguments.Sam Levinson directs this elegant drama, beautifully photographed in black and white and aims to reflect a crisis triggered by that premiere.
Malcolm & Marie has no shortage of themes, which, like theatrical works, reveal ever deeper facets of their characters: inspiration in real people and situations (with their permissions and implications), their relationship with critics, their belongings cultural and racial and its presumed legitimizing role, the link between a director and an actress wife.Malcolm is an outgoing, narcissistic, and partly resentful character. His character begins very ""up"" and borders on the unbearable and from the beginning marks the contrast with the more introverted Marie, who feels displaced.The structure of the film could be summarized as a series of verbal skirmishes in charge of one or the other with successful moments of silence, with a virtuous camera direction that seeks to translate the theatrical essence of the dialogues into cinematographic terms.But unfortunately we are not facing ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" far from it. There is something that is not working (despite the good acting, especially Zendaya's) that hinders the emotional (and also the intellectual) connection with the characters: the lack of dramatic progression and the overly analytical or cerebral nature of the dialogues. and discussions, which erupt almost from the beginning and with little incubation time.Finally, an interesting metafictional aspect is worth noting: Levinson directed Zendaya in the remarkable series Euphoria, with a similar character, but in her adolescence, in such a way that Malcolm & Marie could be seen in this sense almost as a sequel to Euphoria.",Malcolm & Marie
39,TheVictoriousV,The message is that there isn't always a message,7,8 February 2021,"Malcolm & Marie is about Malcolm and Marie. That much I'm certain of. It's a statement I can safely put forth without fearing that I'm making assumptions about the identity of the film's creator, or their intent in creating it.For a film that can so easily be summarized as ""Malcolm and Marie come home, they talk, and they fight"", this picture has a remarkable amount of stirring commentary on the modern film industry and the adjacent world of criticism (not as sagacious as Pixar's Ratatouille, but it'll do). Had I been a more stereotypical critic, I might have asserted that Sam Levinson is using these black characters as a convenient mouthpiece to speak out against the identity politics that suggest a director's racial/sexual/gender attributes meaningfully matter when their work is to be assessed.""Why would real blxck people (sic) ever say this about The Movement? Surely they realize that it's for their sake that I, the white girl from the LA Times, care about black identitarianism and believe even rich movie-makers to be less 'privileged' than me, all due to race?""Maybe we'd be proving his point if we were to type things like that, or at least those espoused by Malcolm Elliott (John David Washington), a neophyte movie director and husband to failed actress Marie Jones (Zendaya). Maybe we ought to ask, as Malcolm rantingly suggests, whether the ideas themselves are valid, or (ironically) if we should even fuss over what The Message might be - let us focus on the filmmaking choices, which needn't be related to who Levinson is or where he came from. Then again, as Marie rebuts (when breaking free from her silent numbness), there is something to be said of authenticity; basing your young, marginalized characters on people who truly know the experience.This is one of the many reasons why HBO's Euphoria (also created by Levinson) was so good; Hunter Schafer, for one, was heavily involved in the writing of the Jules Vaughn character. Whether a piece of cinema is really meant to be about the authenticity in how the characters and topics are portrayed, or the imagination in how it is handled, Malcolm & Marie does well in both ways.Me, I happen to be a fan of clever presentation. I love, for example, a movie where the actors channel a myriad of emotions throughout even the lengthiest takes (all of them beautifully lit and moodily colorless), helping the conversations (i.e. at least 85% of the runtime) remain both interesting and escalatingly tense.Levinson is scarily skilled at keeping us ensnared in scenes of pure talk. Watching the Euphoria Christmas special, I felt as if I could watch an entire movie presented in this manner - think My Dinner with Andre but on the opposite end of the classiness spectrum.With Malcolm & Marie, that's not too far from what I got. The problem with this, I now realize, is that it feels like something's missing. Malcolm & Marie is an example of ""tell-don't-show"" done right. It's just that I might have loved it even more if it was the season finale of a TV series that, y'know, showed stuff.Indeed, some viewers may not buy the characterizations as seen here; how the two leads move from hatred to affection to more hatred, then bonding during scenes that are pretty much squarely devoted to commentary - the screenplay mostly mixes its film-industry critique with the character- and relationship development quite efficiently (Marie feels deeply hurt by some of Malcolm's decisions in adapting ""her"" story to the big screen) but some of it is just ranting. There's quite a bit of messaging in this movie about how movies don't always need to have a message.And even though I am arguably a critic, albeit still a hobbyist with only the occasional guest publication under my belt, I understand the sentiment. The world of criticism has become an ocean of interchangeable, often snooty, sometimes excessively ""academic"" essays since we lost Ebert. It's hip and cool to discuss identity politics and there may be points to make about Levinson. Me, I'm happy to simply inform you that the movie's good but Euphoria is better.",Malcolm & Marie
40,harrylosborne,Relationships under the lens,7,20 February 2021,"From the moment Malcom and Marie walk through their door, there is a palpable sense of something awry. An intangible wall separates the two of them, conveyed through speech and movement.This is what makes this film special: whilst it relies on a heightened sense of what relationship arguments are based on (and could definitely have been shorter), there are fundamentals beneath that anyone who has ever cared for somebody else will have felt.Their nagging desire to continue any argument in the hope of stumbling to a resolution is so human it pains you to watch it. They make the same mistakes any other person would. Whilst their quarrels continue, you see their antagonism grow, as you begin to consider other influencing factors.The monochrome palette simplifies the set and enhances the lighting, all shot beautifully through clever camera placement and sharp focus. This benefits Zendaya and John David Washington, both actors who use their faces to maximum effect in conversation. I think what I most enjoyed was that it ultimately felt real.Arguments are hard to write; they require impulse, a selfish mind to shout what it feels, and this is what sets Malcolm and Marie out - the fact that I actually believed them. I think some people might have not enjoyed this film because ultimately, they probably saw some similarities with themselves.",Malcolm & Marie

No. But still, you will be pleased",7,6 February 2021,"After the premiere of his debut film, Malcolm and his girlfriend Marie have a deep talk about their relationship.A good example that a low budget film, by Hollywood standards, can work in our current days.The main focus is on problems that are transversal to almost all couples, except for one matter or other, and criticizes the film industry slightly, as a footnote.The biggest problem is the repetition, which turns the narrative into a snowball of the same arguments, over and over again, but with different words, making the viewer question and think like ""I saw this 30 min ago, right?"".The performances are very good, I really like both, especially Zendaya, even when she loses the character's momentum and drags her misery for too long.It fails when it tries to take a meta path, but still, gives us interesting notes for reflection.",Malcolm & Marie

Highlight tension, force you to pick up a new hobby, look within yourself and see all of the ugliness, bore you out of your skull or make you appreciate yourself and others around you more.This film seems to contain all of these elements. Malcolm is a filmmaker who returns home from a premier of his latest film and Marie is his girlfriend who sullenly makes him Mac and Cheese. She becomes gradually and increasingly upset that Malcolm didn't thank her in his acceptance speech. It transpires that she is a recovering drug addict whom Malcolm partially based the lead character on in his new movie.As a play, this probably would have worked better. As a film, it's way too long. The characters go constantly back and forth with their arguments, their anger and their frustration, playing off each other.

49,Golden_Hope,Insanely Pretentious,4,5 February 2021,"This movie was exactly what i was expecting when i saw the poster.It is insanely pretentious that it is sometimes cringeworthy.I think this is an interesting concept, a film consisting of just two people and showing their relationship over the course of a single night. After watching i think it might work better as a short film as by the end of its run time it seemed like it just had nothing else to say and felt like the same arguments over and over again.The male character is a film maker that thinks he is the best film maker since slice bread and the whole time i just couldn't stop thinking that he was just a mouth piece for the director. His words felt like the directors. It was like film school pretentiousness with him constantly talking about certain directors and certain moves and not understanding them like Citizen Kane.The whole shooting on film and in black and white was just done to be artsy in my eyes. Maybe it added something a little different to it but i thought it made this gorgeous house look terrible because the film was so noisy resulting in it being so grainy.The construction of some shots were really nice.The acting was ok. Zendaya was pretty good but the male lead was a little over the top for me. The script was another issue. It was so over written. It didn't feel like people talking, it felt like words of a page.The plot was sort of infuriating. It repeated its self so much.The worst part of the movie though was the plot regarding the critic. It was wrote from such a bitter place. The director obviously had a bad review from the LA Times probably the review for Assassination Nation. It was so awkward to watch. It is brought up so much and so often. Really really bad.I would say you could definitely skip it.",Malcolm & Marie

The whole runtime is filled with pretty much one huge argument with some breathing room in between. It was very engaging and was carried heavily by amazing performances by both John David Washington and Zendaya.
Malcolm & Marie also has some pretty gorgeous yet simple cinematography combined with black and white coloring that just made the film feel weighted down and emotional.
Yes, this film is really just one huge argument with no big plot. But it's simplicity and beauty is really what makes this film shine.",Malcolm & Marie
51,theredsky,Malcolm & Marie Review,5,7 March 2021,"This is so frustrating because this film looked very promising. Maybe I went in expecting it to be good but I was ultimately disappointed. First off, John David Washington and Zendaya do an excellent job. I believed that they were portraying these characters and they really bring out their emotional moments in a powerful way. If there is anything to take away from this film, it's the excellent performances. However, their respective characters feel very underdeveloped. Washington's character has little to no characterization while Zendaya's has some but not enough characterization. We get an interesting backstory but that's about it. The script also hampers their performances just a little bit with how basic it is. The messages the film sends are very surface level and don't leave a lot of room for interpretation. One of the messages regards white critics praising films by a black director in a political sense. While I do agree, that's as deep as it gets. This idea isn't explored more and it honestly makes the film feel like a hitpiece against critics. This film did not need to be in black and white. I've honestly tried thinking for a reason behind why the film is in black and white and I can't find one. It makes the film feel very pretentious. I did like how the film was shot though as some of the cinematography is gorgeous and I liked the song choices. If you enjoy Sam Levinson's work or these two actors then you'll probably enjoy this more than I did.",Malcolm & Marie

1 hour and 45 minutes of forced, unnatural and extremely pretentious dialogs; of poses too staged to feel authentic; of end-to-end situations that often get so exaggerated they almost get to the point to be grotesque; of mirrors put in specific places so that the director could make that totally unnecessary but so strongly aesthetic shot.

Zendaya was great too, she's super talented - but I wasn't feeling her in this particular role.To provide some context, the dialogue felt out of place for both characters, as it didn't really feel like dialogue that normal people would say. Mainly for Zendaya in particular - the nature of the content that she was saying didn't match. It would have suited another actress.The arguments go around in circles, which is true to reality - but it's the type of thing that can get annoying to watch (& boring). I was really hoping for a big ending, but the story peeked at around the middle, and there was nowhere for it to go.It wasn't terrible, and I can see why some people would like it.

57,stefstars,Makes Good Points but Dragged Out,6,20 February 2021,"I'm in the middle when it comes to this film. I appreciated the format it's done in. I have understood this was a last minute decision since this was one of the productions affected by the pandemic. It's done like a play, a format you don't see often in recent movies. It reminded me of 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' in terms of the way it was filmed with elements of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ?' It's a movie where you have to pay attention to the dialogue to know what's going on. However, as much as I like that they chose this format, I don't think it worked out for them and the repetitive dialogue doesn't help either.I like the points it brings up about movie critics who use their critiques as a way to show off their college education, sometimes making connections that aren't present for the sake of appearing oh, so intellectual. Obviously this struck a nerve with the Los Angeles Times, since they panned this movie and mentioned the reference that's made to them in their critique. Both characters mock the little ""white girl"" movie critic from the LA Times who is bent on appearing ""woke"" in her critiques yet is just as (if not more) racist as the critics on the other side of the aisle. I loved these observations that were made in the dialogue, I agree with many of them. My only issue is that they can be dragged out to death and I'm not sure if that's to fill up the movie's runtime but I feel that some of it could've been cut back a bit. Malcolm in particular is the character that can stay talking forever about one subject. One scene that comes to mind is after he's read the ""little White girl's"" critic's review on the LA Times website and he goes on a whole rant about how these type of critics add to the race problem rather than solve it. They complain about the white savior trope by playing the role of the white savior, themselves, in real life. Very valid points, but Malcolm stays on this tangent for way too long to the point that he's very repetitive.Some of the lines Malcolm and Marie are made to say don't sound natural, they sound like spoken essays. Which is ironic considering they both discuss how cringe it is for movie critics to feel the need to flex their college education by making everything sound like a cultural studies essay. The main conflict in the film is that Malcolm forgot to thank Marie in the speech about the film he just released which is loosely based on Marie's life and her struggles with addiction. We go back and forth between the two protagonists arguing who's the problematic one in the relationship. Infidelities are revealed, character analyzations are made, Mac 'n' Cheese dishes are made on this hectic night. Who wins the arguing in the end ? No one. Personally I sided with Marie throughout the whole film cos she definitely was the smarter one between the two and definitely deserved at least a small nod in this dude's speech since it's obvious that she was his muse regardless of the other struggling addicts he's met.In terms of acting, both do a pretty good job. I felt John David Washington kind of tried too hard in some scenes. A whole lot of yelling on his part to play the frustrated/ misunderstood director and boyfriend. Zendaya on the other hand is more subtle and her gorgeous, expressive face says more than any of the lines she's given. Maybe Washington's yelling and Zendaya's coolness is supposed to balance it out, but because of the fact that this movie drags on, that balance gets lost. All in all, the play format didn't succeed with this film because the dialogue was repetitive. A point was made 3 scenes back and it's brought up again but with no new insight to offer. It's hard to have any form of attachment with these characters, I did with Zendaya's Marie, but for the general audience I don't think you care whether they stay together or not or who's right or who's wrong, the movie goes nowhere. I see what the director was trying to do but it just didn't work out. This movie couldn't survive in the play format, those other sets and characters were needed to really let this story come to life and do these characters justice. If the script was revised and cut back I still don't think the movie would have succeeded the way it is now. Perhaps they should've waited until the pandemic was over to continue working on this film.
Right now it's just a writing outlet on the screen for the director where he let his inner battles and thoughts loose with a couple's story in the background.",Malcolm & Marie

All the action in the film takes place during one night, finishing at dawn.Director Sam Levinson has written a heavy verbose screenplay and both actors are hugely articulate as they deliver their well written lines.

It's just a story about a couple working through a handful of issues. Some of the dialogue is over the top but most of it is beautiful. Most of all, this movie has what most things do not in 2021: Authenticity. I appreciate people taking a chance and being unique, especially in our over commercialized culture.Kudos to the very small amount of people who made this movie happen so quickly. Those who actually appreciate the art form will appreciate your work.If you have an open mind check this movie out. It's unique and rewarding.9/10",Malcolm & Marie
64,Criticalstaff,A waste of time,3,18 June 2021,"There is a distinct possibility that I did not get this film. That it flew over my head so much thati was never going to understand this movie. This is how this film made me feel. Like I am the stupid one, like I don't understand. This movie made me feel dumb. It felt like punishment.On the other hand, there is an even greater possibility that this movie is hollow and devoid of sense. That it is a self-congratulatory piece about being an artist? I can only guess since, let me stress this, I did not understand what was happening or why.It is a movie about a black couple arguing for two hours, in real time. And if it was not enough it is in black and white for some reason. I feel I needed to insist on the race of the protagonist because the characters themselves mention it and discuss it at length. Only they don't have anything interesting to say on the matter. Malcolm is a director who is frustrated that critics recognize that he is black, and therefore have less recognition of his talent. I guess it might be a valid argument, but it is kind of baffling because Malcolm is a fictional character. The credits only list Sam Levinson, who is a white dude, as the writer. This is where I am lost. Is this for real? Or is the joke so subtle that it's very clever satire? The white filmmaker wrote the rant of the black filmmaker about race. I mean I am all for Death of the Author but I feel like that is taking it a bit too far. If your subject matter is race, it seems convoluted that someone white wrote that dialogue for a black actor to recite it, complaining about on how black filmmakers are treated.The crux of the movie is Malcolm & Marie are actually a good fit. They are both insufferable, I'd say they deserve each other. She throws a fit, then he starts to yell, then they calm down. They kiss a little, then it starts again. There is a parody of a discussion on being an artist and being authentic in the middle.I would say that in essence the film is a celebration of movie criticism. The movie freezes to a halt for Malcolm to find his credit card to remove a paywall for a LA times review. They don't say it outloud but the whole movie is trying to tear movie critic Katie Walsh to shreds. Seeing how boring this film is, I believe she must be a good critic actually. Apparently she gave a bad review to Sam Levinson's previous film. I instinctively respect this woman. If this film is the reaction to one of her reviews, she must doing something right. Keep it up Katie!",Malcolm & Marie
65,ThomDerd,The script is buzzing-The actors are trying...,8,8 February 2021,"This film has a good script with consistent argument-building. It's easy to follow and good enough to keep you interested throughout. For the rest, acting is ok and the youth, looks and fame of the protagonists helps the viewer get more invested in the film. Cinematography is looking alright and the black n white was a good choice; character blocking looks also vibrant and there's plenty of energy in many scenes. Indeed, some might find that small parts are pretentious or unnecessary and other parts rather hilarious such as the one JDW eating with his mouth open while shouting...but these do not spoil the entire film. Overall, the director/writer did a good job creating this piece, giving moments of debate about love, politics, existence and all delivered with a great pace. Maybe this is the new Valentines Day fav movie..? 8/10 strong effort by Levinson.",Malcolm & Marie
66,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,"A Quarantine Double Feature, Part 1: Malcolm & Marie",4,6 February 2021,"Remember when you were out in public - when we could go out in public - and you notice a couple within earshot having a ""discussion."" You're not really doing anything, so you get really quiet so that you can eavesdrop on their back and forth. He says something crazy, and she has a ready comeback. You lean your ear a bit closer, but you're casual about it so they don't notice your nosiness. If it's really juicy, you may get really lost in it and grab some popcorn, but really after about 10 minutes or so, you're bored and you move on to your own life. Malcolm & Marie is that but you're stuck listening to the couple argue for almost 2 hours - well after the initial interest has waned. Malcolm & Marie is this week's big Netflix premiere starring John David Washington and Zendaya in the film produced during last year's COVID-induced lockdown. Here's how I found it.Malcolm & Marie was written and directed by Sam Levinson, who is the creator of HBO's ""Euphoria"". Shot in lush black and white, John David Washington plays Malcolm, a director, whose latest film premiered this night and was well-received; and, Zendaya plays Marie, the director's girlfriend, who comes home after the premiere with tension boiling within. The film is a series of arguments throughout the night between Malcolm and Marie about art, criticism, and the various issues in their relationship. A lot of shouting, primarily from Washington - monologues, pontification, and talk and talk and talk all contained in the rooms of this home.First things first, Zendaya is special. She really can infuse her characters and lines with feeling and energy even when they don't deserve it. Marie is a fine character, but there's not much to it but a sparring partner with Malcolm. Zendaya does her best to give it more and succeeds most of the time. Malcolm is a self-centered, egomaniac and Washington plays into that well enough. The problem with Malcolm is that there is so much talking and shouting that it becomes unbearable. Why is Marie even still there?Secondly, interspersed through all of the talking are some good music cues. The music gives a good respite to the arguing, but it also is supposed to fill in some of those emotional gaps. It is used well and not overdone. The real problem here is that there's no urgency to anything these people talk about. He's screaming about his movie and the critics and blah, blah, blah, even as she's trying to get him to acknowledge her feelings. I was wondering throughout Malcolm & Marie, do I care? When will this be over? And, are these people still fighting? The arguing was just exhausting and not in a good way.Ultimately, there's too much talking and the subject matter of the argument is not interesting, or emotionally fulfilling. This is an argument that you'll want to check-out of early. Even though Zendaya does her best, I only give Malcolm & Marie one popped popcorn kernel and find something else to stream.",Malcolm & Marie

68,pronitmallick,Only Acting and Cinematography,6,7 February 2021,"Malcolm & Marie is a movie that starts with the fine performance of both Zendaya and John David Washington and also ends with it without anything special in the middle other than the performance. The story that this movie delivers us is the one on one conversation between the two actors. Both the actors put all their dedication behind their performance which makes us wanna grind those scenes. It makes us wanna watch their performance again and again considering the fact that how well it's made. Screenplay needed some work. One thing that really struck the presentation of the movie is the cinematography and the grayscale tone was a big part of it.

If instead you are intrigued by the functioning of the human psyche, by the dynamics of human relationships, by the impact of emotions and of their expression (or lack thereof), then you'll probably like Malcolm&Marie .
From a cinematographic standpoint, the movie is sustained by great screenplay and dialogues enacted by superlative acting; so much so that the whole thing might look at times as overdone, hence self-indulgent and self-conscious. But honestly this is an aspect that seem to be annoying for the critics more than for the public.
Reality is that I found the movie aesthetically beautiful and also quite insightful.",Malcolm & Marie
76,Bek204,"""This is not a love story, this is a story of love""",6,14 February 2021,"A director and his girlfriend's relationship is tested after they return home from his movie premiere and await critics' responses. (Via IMDB)First, the film isn't dull, it's just full of dialogues and conversations which makes it seem like it's a boring/dull film. But, the dialogues were so genuine/deep (sometimes) and of course Zendaya and John David Washington made them 10 times better. I think without them, the film would've been DEAD. Now John David Washington's performance was good. But, wouldn't say that it's his best one. His performance in ""Tenet"" (2020) and in ""Blackkklansman"" (2018) was better. In some scenes, I felt like he was just trying so hard to look great and to show everyone that he can fit any role. But, Zendaya's performance was the best which could be because of her character's past that had so many things in it. But, she still killed that performance.I think the reason that makes the film boring/slow/weak is that its story is very simple and it's set in one location (the couple's house) and one night. There are many films that are set in one location and were able to entertain the audience but this film's story is ""TOO SIMPLE"" and there is nothing special about it or something that would make you connect to this couple or makes the audience curious/excited to know what will happen next. NOTHING NEW AT ALL.The dialogues are the film's main thing. They were switching/jumping between conversations/topics about the history of cinema/filmmaking, how critics see films, some important political topics, and each character's past. And, In my opinion, the only ones that I was interested in were the most interesting were the ones about the characters' past, felt like these other topics were too much and were just added there to fill the film's runtime. They were so boring to listen to.The directing was great. Really loved the black & white in this film and its tone. There are also some visually stunning scenes that I enjoyed looking at. The set design (which is just the couple's house) is very beautiful and I really love it.The songs that were used throughout the film were all beautiful and reflecting the couple's story perfectly. But sometimes they were louder than the speech which made it hard to listen to what they were saying.To sum up, the film is a bit boring especially that it's full of dialogues that were sometimes good and sometimes not necessary at all. But it has some really great acting performances.My rating is 6.5/10",Malcolm & Marie

Thank you to Zendaya for being so God damn good. Thank you to John David Washington for looking so fine. Thank you to Sam Levinson for Euphoria - that show blew me away, and I had to see what you were cooking up next . (Mac and cheese, amirite?) Thank you to mac and cheese. You held the opening together through a series of quick cuts. Thank you to beautiful, modernist houses in the middle of nowhere - not only do you allow cast and crews to isolate during a global pandemic but you hold yourself apart from your surroundings so that we all must say ""Who the hell lives here?"" and ""I would not feel comfortable having sex in a lit room at night with all those windows."" Thank you to Zendaya's costume designer - you had a beautiful woman and you made sure we knew it. Thank you to JDW's tux - if 2020 thought us anything, it is that that man looks good in a suit. Thank you to all night arguments - we hate you at the time but we reach a better understanding because of you. At least if you haven't had too much to drink, which Zendaya had not because she is getting clean. (JDW had no shame knocking back a few though, right guys?) Thank you to cigarettes and their power to make us look cool. Thank you to strategically placed oven lighters 'cause they help us get the shot without worrying about the vagaries of matchsticks. Thank you to that lady from the LA Times who must be wondering what Sam Levinson has against her. Unless she knows - then she must be thinking ""Wow. Public way to take revenge much?"" but she gonna have hella fun writing her review of this one (I really gotta go look that up.) Thank you to star power and the perception that two people arguing all night will be more interesting if it's two gorgeous stars. (You are correct.) Thank you to the unfortunate choice to weight the movie towards Marie's side of the argument so we're never really in doubt whose side we're meant to be on, leaving JDW with a lot of ground to make up which he can never really do because his arguments are fairly ridiculous. Thank you to the act of shouting which JDW did a lot of, and it was a bold choice but it was the wrong one. Hey, live and learn. Thank you to black and white photography - hoo boy a girl can look good in black and white. Thank you to the bath tub. I would like a free standing bath tub like that. Thank you to film premieres; I have rarely been to one but I know now they are hot beds of intrigue and skullduggery. Thank you to Tana - why DID you say that thing? That was weird. Thank you to nail scissors; you're blunt and we're better for it. Thank you to John Cassavetes; you can't be beat, man. Thank you to covid-19; Sam and 'Daya woulda been making Euphoria right about now if it weren't for you so I guess we have you to thank for this. Thank you to emotional honesty, 'cause when a woman lets a man know that he has taken and taken and taken from her, and he has not not repaid her in kind, he needs to listen or he will find himself alone in the morning and not 'cause his girl is making more mac and cheese. Finally, thank you to articulacy because these boozed-up, late night, beautiful people sure do know how to turn a phrase. Yes Sir.

It's almost like if the film was Marriage Story but if that film didn't had the things that made it great in the first place.

One is lined in sensitivity, empathy, the other is a projection of our defense mechanisms & pride. This movie ask challenging questions about self-worth and how do you define something abstract like 'love'? Why would you ever want someone you 'love' to feel like bad? Why argue to be 'right,' so vehemently, that you make the person you 'love' feel weak,dumb, inferior, conflating facts to make a bad point?

85,someokiedude,"Free Jazz, as a Movie.",7,10 February 2021,"Like the free jazz of John Coltrane, Miles Davis, or Sun Ra, Malcolm & Marie is a film that runs free and refuses to be constrained or easily defined, almost beckoning you to attempt to understand it, but never offering a safety net or a definitive answer for its own ponderings. It is elusive and difficult to penetrate despite its rather straightforward set up of a couple, debating amongst themselves and each other on if their relationship is truly fruitful or sustainable, almost like a stage play in its approach.It is a film that has been labeled as 'pretentious,' which is certainly understandable, some of its dialogues often go on and on, talking about topics in a way that some might find to feel wanting or desperate to sound profound or meaningful. But I never felt the condescension and self importance of The Matrix or the more egregious self-aggrandizement that Lars von Trier is capable of, attempting to convince everyone how 'deep' and meaningful he is, Malcolm & Marie felt more genuine in its approach in its ponderings. It caused me to go through conflicting feelings while watching it, I laughed (rather it be by design or not), I was shocked, I was confused, and even caught off guard emotionally. Many of the arguments and raw emotion that's touched upon in Malcolm & Marie gave me some uncomfortable flashbacks to arguments that I've had with people in my life, ones that veered into more personal matters and got extremely uncomfortable. But, if I were asked what I think of the film, I can't really say that I know what to make of it, to be certain.What I can say for certain however is that John David Washigton and Zendaya are both excellent, I must say that I've been impressed with Zendaya's change through the last couple of years, as most Disney alumni of her ilk tend to either burn out (often in dramatic fashion) or fade away into obscurity, but she's an exception to the rule, and one that I've been glad to see. She is mesmerizing in the role, carrying a bitterness and a sardonic wit, while also not afraid to let out her emotional vulnerabilities. Washington's performance is also fantastic, he speaks with the eloquence and grace, as well as the intensity that is clearly from his father, the great Denzel Washington, but also captures a physical versatility as well, which is very unlike Denzel's more reticent, cautious style of acting. I wonder if Malcolm is meant to have autism, considering that I myself have the disorder and noticed several tendencies, such as his lack of awareness for social cues, an insensitivity to others feelings, and often acting out in strange ways, such as punching and kicking around when alone and ranting to himself, though perhaps that was something that director Sam Levinson may not have even intended. Washington and Zendaya play well off of each other throughout the film's runtime, often challenging one another to see which one will break first, to see who will outclass the other. Another thing that can be praised for certain is the film's impeccable sense of design, with its evocative cinematography and score, mostly consisting of old classics from James Brown, Duke Ellington, and the aforementioned John Coltrane.The film is certainly flawed in several ways, with the film basically being a series of long monologues, it can feel tedious at points. It was quite disappointing at times when I caught myself becoming distracted with something else. It's not to say that a film of this type can't be done well, as films like 12 Angry Men, Locke, and Glengarry Glen Ross have shown full well that it's possible to have a film basically be a bunch of conversations and still be riveting from beginning to end, even Shakespeare had the remarkable ability of using language in a way where it made mundane conversations feel powerful, unique, and even inspiring. Sam Levinson is not always such a man, while he can craft scenes that are powerful and emotionally challenging, he can just as well veer off into diatribes that make him feel wanting, as if he's trying too hard to be profound and unique. While I did say that Malcolm & Marie is better with its more ponderous nature, that doesn't mean that its flaws can be excused or that it can fall into the traps of other films like it.Malcolm & Marie is a film that's often oscillating between tones, themes, character motivation, and so on. It was occasionally sad, occasionally funny, occasionally joyous, occasionally tragic. It is a film that is often elusive, leaving you more befuddled and curious than you were when you first began to watch it, giving no safety nets for the audience and only giving you. All you're given is the characters, as they are, sometimes saying one thing, while their actions suggest another. I often questioned to myself about what this film was even about, and if I truly 'got it.' If you asked me, it was about two broken people, whose lives are lost for two very different reasons, rather it be from insecurity, addiction, emotional turmoil, and so on. It's about two people who are both toxic to each other, but are also meant for each other in their own unusual way. It's a romance, one that's doomed to fail eventually, and then eventually getting up for the next day is just a statement to their denial of the situation that they're in and an indication that they've learned nothing from their previous experiences, and the cycle continues on.In the end, It's one of those movies where I'm unsure if I liked it, hated it, or just thought that it was ok. But I do know that it had me thinking and I won't be forgetting about it anytime soon.",Malcolm & Marie

I think, that if this film was created in the the 50s or 60s (obviously excluding the tech involved, like smartphones) it would be received just a well as 12 angry men - maybe even better as I prefer the acting within this filmBoth actors where brilliant, and I somehow managed to forget throughout this film that I wasn't watching a marvel movie, and instead just saw the characters portrayed as they are, which is rare for me to do when seeing A class actors - I do think it gets a bit ""peformy"" at points - but again, that's the whole point of a film like thisThere wasn't really a plot I don't think, or a clear narrative, it's just people talking, and that's what makes it brilliant entertainment - I think the people who found this boring aren't used to watching this style of filmThe cinematography was great, with some beautiful looking shots, and a clear understanding of how to compose, which is something I've been wanting after watching a bunch of mostly handheld films.

Only people deeply involved and intertwined are able to home in so devastatingly. The film is carried deftly by actors, John David Washington and Zendaya. The material is sophisticated and raw and the dialog delivered is perfect pitch. The contemporary house is the perfect setting for this story. I love the high note and energy of the first scene and watching Washington dance to James Brown. Zendaya is more than a pretty face, as an actor she is a force to be reckoned with. They both are!

This film explores the Art vs Soul vs Human interaction that many artists struggle with. Literally consumed by their art to the point of destruction.
Malcolm is a man devoid of any empathy unless it revolves around the limitations of his art, whilst Marie is his sponge, an entity for him to feed on. Underneath their exterior are two people madly in love, struggling to recognise one another's qualities because they're consumed by finding meaning and/or recognition in their art.
Malcolm and Marie is a complex movie. It challenges you to listen. It wants you to feel its rhythm. It reminded me of once being a young person who took art way too seriously. It also made me want to eat mac and cheese at 2am!

94,joostkale,Simplistic but keeps you interested,8,14 February 2021,"A movie doesn't have to be complicated or have a lot of characters. This movie starts with two characters who we don't know. Two hours later we end with the same characters, but we know them better than their parents. In these two hours we get two of the best performances of the year. Zendaya and John David Washington are so incredible, that I don't know if this movie would have worked if they wouldn't have been cast. This entire movie is about their relationship. That means that if you don't care about them as a couple, the movie just becomes a forgettable overdramatic romance. But is isn't. From the moment these two arrived I was invested in the story and that didn't go away until the credits rolled. At the end it becomes a bit repetitive and long, but it's already amazing that you can amuse me with two hours of pure fights and monologues. It's not going to be for everybody, but it sure as hell was something I enjoyed.",Malcolm & Marie

96,alex-frey-pattaya,"Brilliant, Authentic and Thorough",10,12 February 2021,"Before people watch this movie they must know what to expect, when you read Zendaya and John David Washington assuming the leading roles, one should know they are the only actors in the movie. Sam Levinson showed with Euphoria already that he is bold and unafraid to be authentic.
Levinson spoke with Zendaya daily about Euphoria during the pandemic, they were bored to be shut down and decided to make a movie, Covid-Friendly at Zendayas house. Apparently he already wrote half of the script for Washington before he even asked him if he was on board.
The result is stunning, amazing and brilliant and absolutely thorough and beyond. This film is definitely not for everyone, it will make people feel uncomfortable, it will bore some people and it will excite those willing to sink in.Levinson transformed a former Disney Teen into a serious actress with Euphoria, she is extremely good in this show but never gets to showcase her range, in Malcolm and Marie he lets her off the leash, worked parts of her Euphoria character in, created even an easter egg scene and whoever is still on board after 45 minutes will be impressed with her Oscar Performance. The same goes for Washington, a brilliant and unafraid delivery from the first to the last scene.The Dialogues are familiar and surprising and shockingly thorough, we all have been in their shoes more often as we want to and exactly that made this movie so interesting.

Both characters were very charming. Zendaya and John David Washington made me care about their Hollywood problems. Not an easy task.I would totally understand if people thought the movie was pretentious: The constant rants about movies and relationships. The couple taking turns yelling and making speeches like it's a neverending audition. A black and white film in 2021. But I enjoyed it. I was intrigued most of the time.Maybe it's because I sometimes like watching couples argue, as long as it's done right.But this still should've been a short film.

Stylistically its great. The actors do a solid job too.Unfortunately the substance of the conversations is not really that interesting for a longer movie. As a short this could have worked, but contrary to the ""before"" series, where chemistry, flow and depth of the conversations really blow your mind and you get moments of relatebility, in this movie you get a message of fragility and brokenness, but beyond that is very little intellectual or emotional stimulation.Also after a while the constant swearing gets on your nervs. I get that they are fighting, but the overuse of the swear words is weakening the dialogue and its impact.Just not enough there, but i still applaud and love the efforts.Very talented trio at work, but the material is too thin, the dialogues not sharp, witty or observant enough to make it interesting.",Malcolm & Marie

We just, you know, go watch them. But it did provide ample entertainment watching him go on and on in his maniacal tirade.

108,laurenjfree,Great Performances in a Not so Great Movie,6,5 February 2021,"I absolutely love both Zendaya and John David Washington. They both gave phenomenal performances in the film, but the plot is where my real problems lie.Movies about relationships and moments in time are amongst some of my favorites. However, it has to have more. It has to have the heart that pulls us in and makes us really believe in what were watching. As if we are there, watching these characters lives unfold before us as we, the audience, try desperately to keep their fictional love alive. I live for movies I like that. I wanted to be invested. Malcolm and Marie missed the mark.There were some really beautiful scenes, but why was it filmed in monochrome? Black and white movies are fantastic, when it serves a purpose. It worked so well in Roma and The Lighthouse, BECAUSE IT SERVED A PURPOSE. Rather, in Malcolm and Marie it came off as a pretentious student film.The characters had the same arguments over and over again. Although I wasn't bored, it felt repetitive. I needed something more to grab onto. I needed a jaw dropping ending, I needed to think about when I made dinner and dream about when I went to bed. Alternatively, it left my mind the moment I switched off my TV. This isn't a movie im ever going to rewatch, and I doubt I'm alone in that respect.I'm giving it a 6/10, although the weak plot and ranting dialogue deserves less, Zendaya and John didn't disappoint. They both really know how to act.I don't know wether to recommend Malcolm and Marie or not. It's all on Netflix so give it a shot, maybe you'll see something I couldn't",Malcolm & Marie

With that being said ""Malcolm & Marie"" is a well made, beautifully shot film that does fall a little short, but that's not such a bad thing. It's ambitious in a good way and it does make some valid points on criticism that in turn made many a professional film critic attack the movie for beating them to the punch (of course it would), which further validates its point. However the films greatest shortcomings lie in its built in claustrophobia that after a while does make the viewer want to go outside for some fresh air (literally).

Also, I was intrigued by the fact that the movie was in black and white.From the beginning to let´s say somewehere in the middle of this film, I was invested in it, I listened to the dialogues carefully and enjoyed most of it. But then I just couldn´t keep my attention anymore and the movie became so very repetative for me. And yes, I mean it repeated itself over and over again. All the points they made, it was repeated.The vizuals were nice, the acting was okay. But I couldn´t bother with its content anymore, with the back and forth between the two characters, so just spaced out totally and at the very end I really couldn´t wait for it to end already. And that right there is just not a good enough movie for me that it makes me wish it would end. The movies I love, I watch them over and over again and fully enjoy every minute, even the longer ones.So, I give it a 5 out of 10, because acting was okay, vizuals were nice and the theme of it had potential and I could relate to some if it. I just really really wish it would have been a bit more exciting, thought provoking and not so repetative.",Malcolm & Marie
112,anthonygiancola24,It's Fine,6,13 February 2021,"Malcolm & Marie is the newest film from Sam Levinson, produced during Quarantine, and starring John David Washington and Zendaya. It takes place over the course of one night and details a fight between Malcolm, an up and coming filmmaker, and his girlfriend Marie. The argument stems from Malcolm forgetting to thank Marie in his speech before his film's premiere.It's an excuse to showcase John David Washington and Zendaya as performers. Two performers who I have lukewarm feelings about to begin with. Both are good in the film, but the acting is very stage-y. It all does feel like a play, but after like ten minutes, I just accepted the style. They work well together and have pretty fun chemistry. In fact, both are so good, they almost distract me from the glaring weaknesses of the script.I will say that for the first part of the film, I was really digging it. The low-fi aesthetics with the quick snappy dialogue really put me in the mood. The main issue of this film is that it is a one location, two character, movie. Neither the location, nor the issue between the characters are dynamic enough to sustain the momentum the film is going for. What really sucks is, since there is a restriction of time and space, we don't get to see anything of this relationship outside of this one hour. Not saying that you need that, but it might help let us in to the argument a bit more.Taken as a whole, Malcolm & Marie is an interesting experiment that I don't think fully pays off, but there are some strong elements. I think this subject matter deserves a better film, and maybe one day we'll get it, but for now? This is fine.But I have to ask: what has happened to Sam Levinson? The provocateur, the rebel, the absurdist. The guy who made the truly bonkers pop-satire Assassination Nation, and staged that breathtakingly gorgeous carnival sequence in the fourth episode of Euphoria? Why has he been replaced by this stoic, self serious, drama mama, just bleeding my time with these emo dirges? It's almost as if Levinson refuses to acknowledge his own artifice, trying to trick you into thinking that his characters are deeper and more complex than they are.",Malcolm & Marie

Zendaya attracts me to almost everything and I will watch because of her no matter how bad or good the movie is. The acting was A+ the story is like any real life couple. Going around in circles when arguing, being redundant. That was how the movie was, however, it showed real life and real relationships. It shows how much people can be petty.

And usually I would agree with that argument, except in the case pertaining to the film Malcom & Marie. This film is not a film about a Black couple. It's a film about a couple - The fact of their color is only a case of happenstance. These people could be anyone, anywhere in the world. That's what makes this film so unique and the reason I stand by it as good film making, an excellent cast and terrific writing and direction.

It is pretentious and pandering to the extreme, as if to say ""Look, this is a deep movie about the underlying friction between two people who love each other and it's shot in black and white so it is awards material"".Watch it if you have nothing else to do, or if you like Zendaya and/or JDW or you are curious about the movie (all three reasons I watched it). I hope you come out with slightly better opinions of it than I did.",Malcolm & Marie
120,sfworthington,Love & Art,10,8 February 2021,"I'll be honest this film was very difficult to watch for me, but it was cathartic, and I think it made me love it even more.
When they started the film with the credits I knew I was in for a treat.
I forgot who said this but I saw someone say that Malcolm & Marie is not a love story but instead a story about love. That seems so simple but it's so so true. Who thought that perspective would make a romance like this so profound. Because this film is profound. All we have are two people, two people in a relationship, who love each other tear each other apart, put each other back together again and then continue this cycle all in the course of one night. I'll compare it to Marriage Story in that there is no bias on either counterpart, there are times you side with Malcolm and there are time where you side with Marie. That's the key to a great romance especially when you are showing a love affair with cracks beginning to show.
The fact both of these characters are artists in their own right makes emotions even stronger because as an artists you feel things in varying levels. Sometimes more strongly sometimes less so, sometimes your art will tie you together and connect you like nothing else but it can just as easily break you. In this context it adds another layer to a complex relationship and that's why for me it just struck a core more so than anything I've seen for a very very long time. Therefore I may be biased towards this film however you can't lie it captures love in a raw and unfiltered way that hurts like a knife to the heart but you would never want to be without it.
Technically this film is a flourish of effective understatement, with the bold use of black and white and strongly framed shots. The script is just insane and although music isn't used much and it's played within the world of the film instead of underscoring the action it fits so well. Also it would be criminal of me to not mention just how amazing Zendaya and John David Washington are. Neither of them outshine each other, they light each other up on screen and leave everything on the floor. Landmark performances from them both.
From first glance people don't seem to be liking this film as much as I am, however I do think it's that kind of film, take it how you want but you'll experience both beauty and pain and that's a killer combo.",Malcolm & Marie

You can tell the both of them took time to practice and build their emotions throughout the movie. Their chemistry as a couple in this film is top notch; you'll think they are in a REAL relationship. One moment you understand Malcolm's side of the story. While you can also (and DEFINITELY) understand Marie's story.One moment I am amuse, in shock, laughing, sad, and understanding of both characters struggles.' Sam did an amazing job to balance his screenwriting abilities, plotting (directing), and screening each plot. Sam does not skip the storyline. He goes from A, B, C, D, and then back to A. I honestly do not understand some of the critics rating the movie low because of the screenwriting.Personally, the screenwriting is amazing. Sam balanced the whole movie that happened inside of the house, outside of the balconies, and the yard. That is not an easy task to fulfill, but he did it. The critics just do not get the movie or how love and envy in a toxic relationship works. Malcolm and Marie show this and that is why the critics are praising the acting. John and Zendaya delivered, which made the film more enjoyable.Sorry if this is long, I must say how I feel (without spoiling too much) of the film. This film is great and I hope Zendaya, John, Sam, and whoever played apart of the film gets accolades for their work.10/10 - Highly suggest to watch it. Also, Leave Zendaya and John alone. They are grown adults. I don't care how ""young"" Zendaya looks to be John's love interest. In real life, I've seen 20 something year olds with guys not even ten years older than them.

124,Senryu-Cherry,"In a sick relationship, couples block every red flag.",6,10 February 2021,"The movie is a character study of a guy who made a movie about drug abuse and a girl who is a drug abuse survivor. The movie is in greyscale which is aesthetically pleasing and can be symbolised as figuring out a grey-thin-line of comfort in this love-hate relationship. They were failing and trying to have sex throughout which can be symbolised as them trying to know the other better or just getting under each other's skin to inflict more harm. Malcolm is scared of being called a ""mediocre director"". He also has limited self-awareness to the point he crucifies anyone who talks against his work or himself. Marie is extremely self-sabotaging and unable to share her feelings without passive aggression.There are some good pointers discussed (don't quote)
1. Just because I'm a black man doesn't mean everything I make is political or about race.2. How indifferent/similar an artist can be to their art? (Marie says she toils with both his directional edits and him as a boyfriend for the same reasons)3. How does a perspective define one's reality? (Malcolm says you want control because you can't understand why I'm with you. The reason is I love you.)4. Is an apology enough to regain trust? (Marie always feels Malcolm takes her for granted. He, in fact, didn't give her the credits she truly deserves, but he apologised for it a million times)5. You need to appreciate yourself.(Marie has a monologue in which she reminiscents the acts she has done for Malcolm. It can look as selfishly counting one's worth, but it was curing for Marie because she struggles with self-esteem)The whole movie was about them projecting their insecurities and verbally abusing each other. Malcolm was worse than Marie in this case. This talking in circles is what I believe was the red flag. They are incapable of having a conversation without being hurtful. But since they are truly in love (debatable), they are not addressing their incompatibility. It doesn't give you a second to breathe before bringing another session of screaming, swearing and tearing the other down. And this is not how normal relationships should be, there can be disagreement but not this level of abuse. Don't watch this movie if you're in a toxic relationship or trying to wind down. I was exhausted because it was incredibly overwhelming.",Malcolm & Marie
125,gg2507,"Great acting, terrible pacing",5,8 April 2021,"Acting is on point, both performances are very strong and believable. Cinematography is also great.BUT the pacing is terrible. It would have been an amazing short, but there's not enough going on to justify its 100 minutes. The conversations become repetitive, with the characters talking about the same subjects for too long. They keep coming back to the same issues and fighting and making up and then fighting again for THE SAME REASONS. Also Malcom's monologues are very unatural to me (not an acting issue but more of a script issue, the words he use, the whole structure of the speech is just not realistic).In the end, this left a strange taste in my mouth. Analyzing the scenes separately you're able to fully enjoy the performances from the talented leads but watching the movie as a whole you just get...bored.",Malcolm & Marie
126,SimonsRants,Stop. Just Stop,4,7 February 2021,"A pretentious man and a mentally unstable woman fight for almost two hours. That's it.The cinematography is gorgeous. The directing has its moments. And actors are certainly talented. But my goodness, this movie felt like being hit with a hammer in the head repeatedly for its entire duration.After the first 20 minutes I thought to myself, ""That was a pretty good short film. I didn't mind that."" But then it kept going and going and going. And the longer it went the less relatable and more awful the two leads were revealed to be.The man is an egotistical and pretentious sort who keeps a list of all the favors he does for his girlfriend and holds it over her head when she asks for anything in return. The woman is mentally unstable and verbally abusive, gaslighting and playing the victim in a toxic manipulative way. The way they portray the supposed ""fine line between love and hate"" bears no actual semblance to real life or real relationships - at least not in mine. If your relationship is like this - RUN. This is not normal. This is not okay.Every argument that starts back up again only shows more why both characters don't deserve our sympathy. We do not know anything about either character except what they tell us by screaming at each other over the course of the film. It's exhausting. It's unwatchable at times.I gave this a slightly higher rating at first - a 5/10 - because from a technical standpoint, it's very well made I just didn't care for the handling of the plot. (That's not to say I didn't enjoy the idea, I think films like Locke are intriguing and Marriage Story was fantastic. This didn't quite do it for me though because... well, the toxicity of it all) But after seeing how women of Twitter have responded, my feelings toward the movie have soured a bit more. This honestly reminds me of when Fight Club came out and the narcissistic a-holes who watched that idolized Pitt's character and turned him into a hero.

130,RomanceNovelist,Brilliant and doesn't insult the intelligence of the black audience like a Tyler Perry movie,10,7 February 2021,"I'm giving this movie a 10 for artistic quality, story, the fact that it held my attention with only two actors commanding the screen and cinematography. I might have given it an 8 but it scored a bit higher because it gave me a story about black people that didn't mention the typical stereotypical stuff most of us black folks don't identify with, like drugs or crime, or traumatic topics like police violence, slaves, or the white savor trope (i.e., The Help or The Blindside) basically topics Hollywood seems to think black people are limited to or care about. I look for stories about black people that don't insult my intelligence, like a Tyler Perry movie. No screaming adults or ignorant folks (the language Perry seems to think black people think and speak in). I can barely stomach his movies. I can watch and enjoy a Spike Lee movie, who... now that the rest of America is ""woke"" is better understood.Ironically, Spike is mentioned a few times, so the director may have been thinking of Spike when selecting the soundtrack. Or maybe he was thinking of him when he cast David Washington (son of Denzel Washington, who worked with Spike on two of his most important films, three total).What surprised me is that a white director could write black characters so succinctly, much less direct them without reducing the characters or the conflict to stereotypes. David Washington embodying that young cool, black dude swagger, and Zendaya in an unexpected role that was sexier than I was used to, because I still saw her as a girl rather than an adult. So it took a few minutes for me to dismiss any expectations I had about her age.Is the fact that the entire film is black and white a bit pretentious? Yes. Does it work? Yes. Malcolm and Marie held my attention throughout. It's a long movie, but I didn't notice the time passing because I wanted to know what would happen to this couple. I was anxious to find out. Like 2020's The Photograph, I enjoyed it. It's a movie for adults.Maybe we can get back to a time when we have more black films with something to say. Even comedy that has more to say and doesn't involve a black man in drag disguised in an insulting caricature of black women. Maybe we can get back to a time where there were movies like Mo Betta Blues, Jungle Fever, or The Best Man, Love and Basketball, and a few others that left us feeling a certain way. Malcolm and Marie is ""THAT"" movie in 2021. Good job.",Malcolm & Marie

I felt like I was listening to a neighbors hour long fight but I could not turn away because it was brilliantly done and I wanted to know how it ended. I love this film. This film has classic written all over it. JDW is a brilliant actor, I have been a fan since Ballers. I hope these two do more movies together because this is wonderful. If you have ever had a long conversation or a fight with the one you love you will enjoy this movie. I found myself laughing at JDW when he was fighting while eating mac and cheese, and when he was having an argument with himself outside. I will watch this again. This is a classic, much like Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolf. Great job to Sam Levinson, this was a super meaty script. I loved it. More please!!!",Malcolm & Marie
133,Valken-Industries,Be careful what you grab from the past...,8,8 February 2021,"This is a movie with amazing acting, beautifully shot, and music that stands out - yet doesn't distract. Those are some of the items that helped make this great. It is based on two people and their night together digging up the past. I feel it is trying to teach us a lesson. One that I will dive into below...Remember Lot's wife...
Third shortest verse in the bible.
""Cool and how does that apply?""
Let me explainLot's wife looked back on the old life they were living. The question is how did she look back? Did she look back longingly, in disgust, in amazement, in regret, with nostalgia, in anticipation that nothing will be better moving forward, was she excited for the next chapter, was she angry, was she sad, was she happy? Well, she was turned to a pillar of salt so we will never know.
As for this movie it is an example/warning of when we look back, and how we use it. Similar to the scripture I feel that this movie is advising us to be careful when looking back. If we dig up the past let's do it so that we can be better, let's not do it so we can fling around mud and make everyone else feel gross and dirty.
How do Malcom and Marie move on from such a tumultuous night? Hopefully side by side...
Does bringing up the past have consciousness? Yes, so be careful what you dig up because some things are better left unsaid. At the same time, don't bury things in your past without acknowledging them first. Just be careful with how that takes place. Use your words to build up, not tear down. If you have to tear it down, realize that you are damaging it in the process, and do so with such care and consideration that you don't leave another memory buried in your past in hopes that it never gets unearthed...
Malcom and Marie uncovered items from the past day and months/years that were hurtful, yet necessary to get them on the same page. Be careful with what you bury and what what you dig up.Okay enough preaching ;) back to my 8... Well I am sad that it ended. How do they move on? There won't be a sequel so don't leave me hanging. If we are to watch these two dig up the past and use it like that, what are the repercussions? Is that good, is it bad? Yes they said sorry, yes they said thank you. But I wanted more clarification, yet - at the sametime an 8 out of 10 is pretty high. Because this shouldn't be a perfect showcase of how to handle the past - but more a more glimpse of what it looks like when doing it. It's up to us to decide how or if we want to replicate this in our lives and more importantly with whom.",Malcolm & Marie

""it's pretentious"" ""not engaging"" ""it's just about a couple fighting"". You don't have to like the film but at the very least be original in your criticism.It's clear to me people are losing their sense of realism with being glued to the enormous trend of superhero sci-fi films and unnecessary sequels. Cinema is also about intriguing dialogue with realistic earthly circumstances. Sometimes you need to appreciate a more realistic emotional story.This film is simple yet at the same time complex as what most relationships are. Human emotion and romance isn't sappy or cheesy one liners you see in sitcoms. It's deep, its raw, its cruel, and it crosses boundaries.I give it a 7/10 overall it's a good film with excellent acting however the only critique I have with the film is that it remains the same with no unexpected twists or turns revealed.",Malcolm & Marie

In truth, all couples fight exactly as they do, with most of the brutality, but little of the honesty. Malcolm and Marie explores how many layers of pain and anger must be peeled away in order for two human beings to achieve empathy and understanding. A small careless act ignites a nightlong battle between two lovers, the battlefield being each other's ego, self-worth, and shame. In short, Malcolm and Marie is 106 straight minutes of verbal revenge sex.",Malcolm & Marie

From the script to acting to filming and editing...there hasn't been this type of engagement on personal levels on screen since Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

Superb all.

144,elwynchofmann,Pretentious? Yeah. Still Good? Yeah,7,6 February 2021,"So that would explain why the critic reviews were so low..Malcolm and Marie is so beautifully shot. I love the black and white and the grain of the film. The jazzy score also serves the story greatly. John David Washington and Zendaya kill it - that scene were Zendaya had the knife made my jaw drop. That's how you subvert expectations. The film teaches about the importance of showing gratefulness in a relationship and being appreciative for the small things your partner does for you which, personally, is something I need to be reminded of often. Some people just assume your partner knows your appreciative, but some people want you to tell/show them. I really appreciate the film for spreading that message.However, the film is not without its flaws. Because the movie is very much dialogue-driven, it can a bit exhausting at times. My bigger problem with the film, though, is the lack of nuance and subtlety it carried with the multiple anti-critic monologues. The first one, I didn't mind, but the second one lasts about ten minutes, and it may have been better off if Sam Levinson just walked on set and gave a spoken word. The whole message just does not work within this film and felt so fourth-wall breaking. It doesn't ruin the movie for me, but It definitely took me out and, unfortunately, holds the film back from being much greater than it could've been.Still, I absolutely love the visuals, score, and cinematography of this film. I'd love to see more of these low-budget, small set, limited cast movies that are heavily focused on characters and relationship over big budget spectacle. I love the indie style of this movie and how it was shot during lockdown. Does it compare to Marriage Story? Not even close. Should the critic sub-plot have been left out and just further developed the relationship between Malcolm and Marie? Yeah. But this is the film we got, and it was still a delight to watch.Rating: 8/10",Malcolm & Marie
145,Badsharkmoviefan_118,Two people argue the end,1,11 February 2021,That sums up this movie it's 2 people in a clearly toxic relationship arguing over dumb things.

This was more painfully to watch then my grandmother dying in front of my eyes. Never again,Malcolm & Marie
146,laithlaith,Eminem(M&M),8,13 February 2021,"What the movie is criticizing is happening to this movie. Like it is being said in the movie, not all movies need to have a formidable outcome that makes it uniquely unforgettable and not all movies have to have some political affiliation. The movie is being called dull and pretentious and many other things. On the bases that it's just a couple fighting with no outcome. Well it doesn't have to be anything other than that it's art. It's made to be felt and lived through, especially when it's about a relationship.The movie isn't perfect it does give a sense of pretentiousness due to the screenplay and how the beautiful ideas are shown. However, maybe that's the purpose, maybe the viewer isn't supposed to be overwhelmed with emotions and tears in order to for once understand the complexity of a simple argument that was stretched over 1hr 41 minutes because nothing is that simple and it's all layers over layers. All this complexity in the end is proven to have simple solutions that are hard for the individual human being to abide by no matter how simple they may seem. A relationship is held intact with 2 things: self-love(Marie's problem) and thankfulness(Malcom's problem).Overall, the acting was great, especially washington which had his best role in my opinion. The cinematography and direction was as beautiful as could be. The main themes and ideas of the movie are brilliant. However, the screenplay could've been done much better but is still very good.",Malcolm & Marie

The writing and acting Washington forces in attempts to feel/sound/look deep and having value as the storyline's filmaker and boyfriend of a ""less than"" girlfriend he needs for his sense of being a ""good person/ego booster"" yet also has an inner desire to keep subjugated.

154,jazzydonald-90958,The Problem With Age Gaps,5,30 June 2021,"I personally found this movie very uncomfortable and unpleasant just because I don't like watching people argue. Other than that, it's still a fine movie. Not Oscar-worthy, but it's ok for a low-budget movie with one setting and only two characters. My biggest gripe with the movie is the dynamic between Malcolm and Marie. It felt like Malcolm was abusing Marie rather than arguing. The difference between an argument and abuse is the same difference between a fight and a beating. Power. If both sides have equal amounts of power, then it's an argument. If one side is overtly stronger, older, and or wealthier than the other, then it's abuse. Malcolm is the primary breadwinner and is older than Marie by 12 years. He clearly holds the most amount of power in the marriage. Neither directors nor actors saw a problem with this setup because age gap marriages where the man is the older one are prevalent in movies.That being said, Malcolm & Marie could've been excellent if it served as a cautionary tale of age gap relationships and why they rarely work in the long run. Malcolm's comment about how he helped Marie during her lowest point was a great setup for how a lot of people end up in age-gap relationships. The older person was usually the younger person's savior and or mentor. Young people always seek guidance, especially if they're poor, have big dreams they don't know how to accomplish, and or suffering from an affliction. When the young person gets over their issues, they naturally grow closer to the older person. While also feeling indebted. Not to mention the older person may grow a sense of entitlement and feel as though the younger person ""owes them."" Once the arguing starts happening, one of the most common points the older person likes to use is, ""without me, you'd be nothing!"" The younger person is also susceptible to control due to their lack of life experience. At first, it's the little things like how they dress, what foods they should eat, and what they do for entertainment. Then it gradually escalates into being forbidden from befriending anyone of the opposite sex, being told to not speak without permission, and how often they can see their family. A way the older person justifies their control over the younger person is by taking a more parental role by saying, ""I know what's best for you.""Part of the reason why Malcolm & Marie faught so much is because of their age gap. For example, what would a 25-year-old and a 45-year-old even have in common? The answer is almost nothing. While it's true that opposites attract, if there's no common ground, then the relationship will be superficial and unstable. A 25-year-old and a 45-year-old are on entirely different planes of existence. One of my favorite scenes from the Netflix show, Bojack Horseman, was when Diane explained to Mr. Peanutbutter why so many of his marriages failed. The answer is because he keeps pursuing women in their early 20s. A 25-year-old is not a fully formed adult, no matter what the law says. They're still trying to figure things out and what they want to do with our lives. I doubt many people in their 20s who know what to do for a career. Whereas most people in their 40s usually have their lives figured out and are comfortable with settling down. The few who don't are usually immature, and immature people in their 40s with money can be dangerous and predatory. This is how age gap relationships can lead to grooming and abuse.",Malcolm & Marie

The shifting balance between the two characters keeps us on edge the entire time and we're never quite sure where it's taking us next. It's definitely a daring film to make and I'm sure it will split audiences by a large margin. It's not very easy to digest and I believe it would be better suited for the stage than the screen.

Even though they seemed like to have solved the situation at first, the argument starts up again out of no where. The arguments are emotional and seems realistic. And the movie is a great character study. But the way the arguments start are ridiculous. The movie seems like a boxing match except with arguments.

But if you are someone you is invested by good writing, this film definitely has the right elements. This writing is good but could have been improved but that is purely for some of the dialogue. The acting itself is great, the chemistry feels real and very believable that these two actors actually are in a relationship which is very key for the film. For me Washington is that standout, he is amazing in this film and definitely shows glimpses of brilliance. Zendeya is good but not better than Washington, her character can either be extremely confident or emotional, and those emotions can switch a bit too quick which doesn't feel realistic or true to the material. The directing is good and the cinematography is visually pleasing, especially for a film in black and white.

Throughout the whole movie I screamed ""Leave him! Please just go and be on your own!"" in my mind constantly. It was painful to watch at some point.
Zendaya's performance is stellar, John David Washington and his character Malcolm are hard to endure and his screaming fits are incredibly annoying and unnecessary (and way overacted).

Were used to lowbrau, predictable nonsense that doesn't challenge the acting chops of the subjects. This is an extremely grueling film of a couple that rips each other apart emotionally like so many of us. These two don't like each other, even though they think they're madly in love. They're just mad. Foaming at the mouth mad.The cold, exacting bitterness the draws blood almost every time they look at each other out of bed harkins back to Liz Taylor and Richard Burton in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). More recent, Clive Owen and Julia Roberts in Closer.Malcolm thinks he's in love with someone who has not learned to love herself because of her past. At the same time, he only loves her when she's adoring him. Then she loathes him because she doesn't believe he sees her.The two are emotionally unhealthy carnage co-dependent on each other. Mutual destruction is assured but they are that dysfunctional couple that will probably stay together 10 more years nonetheless making each other miserable.The acting is mesmerizingif only because many of us recognize ourselves in the two of them. For people who appreciate excellent film with superb acting, this is a MUST see. Zendaya is incredible. She is a grown woman and she acts like one in this film. John Washington is always delicious to watch but his acting is certainly closing in on his father.",Malcolm & Marie
180,keone-game2,Amazing Performance,8,8 February 2021,"Malcolm & Marie is aesthetically beautiful, and it offers ascending superstars Zendaya and John David Washington a chance to show off their immense acting skills. But while the film is a stylistic treat on the surface, it has very little depth.",Malcolm & Marie
181,copperrd,Exhausting Repetition,9,7 February 2021,"The relationship of the two sole characters of this film is revealed all in the matter of one long-winded, repetitive argument. The black and white picture sets the mood perfectly as the viewers are able to enter the bleak, exhausted relationship of Malcolm and Marie. There are several ups and downs as we follow the couple through the night, but it is easy to realize this one night mirrors their relationship as an entirety. If you're interested in a good story, listen. This film is unique as the actors do not show you their trials and tribulations, rather, they speak them. Be patient while watching this, and do not expect a conclusive ending. With a toxic and chaotic relationship such as these characters', it would not be true to put a 'period' at the end of the film, as their story is a never-ending, exhausting repetition.",Malcolm & Marie
182,cathode-94655,Team Marie,8,9 March 2021,"I rated this an 8 because I spent the day after watching it, thinking about it!
The arguing was exhausting, so I guess drew me in although I had to turn the volume right down. However they were a captivating pair of talkaholics (seemingly on aderol). Realistically, considering the boundaries crossed, it was all a little over civilized, there wasn't even any interrupting. Also inconclusive because Malcom just wanted to win and Im not sure any of their problems were solved. Slightly disappointed on that front and not expecting a sequel, which I would definitely watch.",Malcolm & Marie

Ok.",Malcolm & Marie
185,roel-willemsen,"Flawed, just like the characters",6,5 February 2021,"Malcolm & Marie follows an extremely simple premise of a filmmaker and his girlfriend coming home after the premiere of his movie, and then proceed to argue for almost the entire night. There are a couple of things to unpack here.First of all, the positives.
Both actors deliver. John David Washington is oustanding, and continues his run of excellent performances over the last couple of years. His character is very expressive and intense, and you can clearly see he's all for it.
Zendaya's star is still rising, and she also delivers in a genre that has up until this point been uncharted territory for her. Her character leaves a little to be desired at the start, where she seems somewhat monotone and held back, but she later gets her moments to shine and totally nails them.
The relationship between the two characters portrayed by these actors feels and seems authentic, with all manner of genuine relationship issues being covered and discussed.
There's also John David Washington's rant on how contemporary movie reviewers tend to look for things that aren't there in movies and try to make everything political, which I just liked.There are some issues I feel like I have to address.
The movie feels too long, and most of that has to do with the dialogue.
There are quiet moments, but the movie is otherwise stuffed with dialogue. The movie follows a pattern of a constant back-and-forth between the two leads, with long speeches or rants given by each one at a time. There's some impressive acting here, but this schtick does get repetitive and is not as interesting or poignant as it's supposed to be. The dialogue is furthermore very exposition heavy, which is logical given that the movie largely plays out in real time and we don't get to see any details about the characters' past. Also, the script makes use of a lot of big words and some very coherent sentencing, which to me makes the whole conversation feel a little too fabricated.
There's also the fact that the movie is shot in black and white, which honestly doesn't really add anything. The camerawork and editing are still very much done in a contemporary style, so the supposed authenticity one is meant to gain from shooting in black and white is somewhat lost.All in all, the starts deliver, but the movie's premise and execution are just not that interesting or innovative. 6 / 10",Malcolm & Marie
186,Queenie04,Exhausting to watch but good!,7,5 February 2021,"I'm glad I watched this film in my living room with the volume low and not at the cinema.The dialogues were a bit on and off to me. It was a bit hard to keep up at times with all the shouting and swearing. Sometimes a bit too scholar on Marie's side, like she was reading her lines.That said, I think the acting was really good. Enough to keep me captivated during the whole time. It felt authentic.The aesthetic in general was raw and really beautiful.",Malcolm & Marie
187,lee-00705,It's M&M's world and we're just living in it.,6,9 February 2021,"Starts strongly but loses focus quickly and decends into a mouthpiece for frustrated directors, screenwriters and students of film school.
JDW and Zendaya are excellent actors and revel in playing very narcissistic, almost sociopathic characters the dialogue is sharp, spiteful and would probably kill in front of a theatre audience but up close on your TV screen Malcolm and Marie come across as over smart, spoilt, toxic and extremely unlikeable. I don't need to like the people I see in a movie but I need to find something I can connect with or understand their motivation. Unfortunately I find neither with either character.
It becomes a chore spending time with these guys they live in a world of self importance which ends up being alienating.
Btw this film actually looks and sounds great so props to it on that side of things.",Malcolm & Marie
188,killianmars,Casual viewers will not like this movie,10,19 February 2021,I was turned onto this movie by my girlfriend who hates mainstream cinema and she heralded this as one of the best movies she had ever seen. While I wouldn't go as far to say that I would say that it is the best and most realisticly written and acted movie I've seen since marriage story and if you are not afraid of a tough watch and slightly slow burn drama this movie is the perfect fit for you.,Malcolm & Marie
189,negroswan,"Raw and refreshing, but still falls short.",6,6 February 2021,"Many reviews found the film boring as it is essentially a couple arguing back and forth for 2 hours, but I can appreciate the candid and honest depiction of a real-life couple fight. The black-and-white direction was stunning and allowed us to see the nuances of Malcolm and Marie's relationship. However, I think this movie tried too hard to be authentic that some of the dialogue came across as pretentious and the film overall fell short of true authenticity. Also, I was just not a fan of either JDW or Zendaya in this film.",Malcolm & Marie
190,tayloroverstreeta,Great visuals and soundtrack - but it is unrealistic that two people in a toxic relationship don't interrupt each other,7,16 February 2021,"The acting was superb and the soundtrack was incredible- using music most watchers haven't heard is always a great move. My favorite song was wasted by NNAMDI.It's definitely pretentious to make character monologues about film critics while creating a film- the same way authors love to have their characters be novelists.I think this movie makes great-and realistic- commentary on abuse in relationships-especially when there is an uneven power structure. Malcolm ultimately shows qualities of being a narcissist and is otherwise unredeemable as a partner while Marie is his softer, younger, more vulnerable victim who has been trapped in his clutches for all of her adult life and has little chance of escaping.",Malcolm & Marie
191,tayloroverstreeta,Beautiful but Obnoxious,7,18 February 2021,"The score and soundtrack was amazing- new RnB mixed with punchy jazz.The visuals are also spectacular- the house and filming location were gorgeous and I love a movie with a single location.
It's gotta be the most pretentious and unoriginal plot to make a movie about a filmmaker and then critique film critics during the movie.Zendayas character is so intelligent and it was very enjoyable hearing her articulate her thought on the relationship- however its unlikely that two people fighting so viciously would ever give each other the time to monologue.During the film Malcolm is clearly an abuser to Marie- who is much younger and has been made to be dependent on Malcolm as he takes away everything she likes about herself (including work opportunities) and rubs her past addiction in her face. This is not a toxic relationship- this is an abusive relationship where Malcolm is an abuser and shows signs of being a narcissist- and I don't think that point is driven home well enough for the audience to take that away from the film.Malcolm and Marie visually make a slightly awkward couple- Zendaya's tall and slender and doesn't quite match up with John David Washington's stout and burly- although they are both extremely attractive actors apart from each other.",Malcolm & Marie
192,gabrilapo,Exceptional performances by two gifted actors,9,21 February 2021,"Malcolm & Marie gives the opportunity to two young actors to shine. Zendaya impresses us with an outstanding performance as well as John David Washington. They both show us how they can turn a not pretentious movie with a plain plot into a mind blowing film.

193,brooksmurphy-1,Acting through the word weeds of pretentiousness,5,11 February 2021,"He wears his French New Wave/Cassavetes influences on his sleeve here, too bad he's wearing a pretentious long-sleeved turtleneck. Nepotistic director Sam Levinson did some good work on Euphoria, but I have to say the acting was what climbed out of his need to shove every word in the dictionary through their mouths. Same goes with this film, although far more self-indulgent and frustratingly hilarious to watch. The acting is good but not good enough to climb out of the word weeds. Opinions?",Malcolm & Marie

196,heyyyoliver,"Less than expected, but it holds up well",6,7 February 2021,"I liked it, even though I was expecting a lot more, considering I knew who was involved with this film.
The camera work was beautiful, just as expected from Levinson, the acting was good, the set design was really good, the music was about the best part, I think, and the writing was fantastic, but the 'f this/f-ing that's and 'give me a break's got exhausting at some point. It's supposed to make characters more real, annoyed, theatrical and to the point, I get it, but it was like ""less is more"" for the most part.
I was getting a 50s Hollywood, but also a 70s France feeling during some of the shots, which was really interesting and beautiful, but also sometimes quite pretentious.
For me, it was the quirky remarks, funny one liners, Zendaya's middle fingers in the air after proving her point, the little things that made it so enjoyable.
But honestly, I saw someone put this is the ""straight people yelling at each other for two hours"" genre and I don't really disagree.
It's solid, it's worth watching, but I didn't necessarily feel a whole lot as the story was unravelling. I was mostly in awe with the chemestry, because both Zendaya and John were just so captivating, it was excellent. I absolutely loved them together.",Malcolm & Marie
197,gpapakyprianos,a very needed movie as of 2021,9,6 February 2021,"From the view of a problematic relationship, this movie shows the lack of understanding, of forgiving and thankfulness in todays society. Through many outbursts and calming moments, it brilliantly depicts the ups and downs of life, the human passion, the spirit and soul. It gives away a sense of a twisted romance, though it's more a socially twisted drama.
overall a very well shot black and white movie",Malcolm & Marie
198,bondcassie,Incredibly insightful into good relationships,10,31 May 2021,"My husband and I, married 25 years, were very impressed with this movie.Other reviewers, sad to say, saw it as fake and pretentious.This is not true. We found ourselves going ''oh yes, that's been us"" and ""gee that sounds so familiar"" over and over again.When in relationship we had to go through a lot of confrontations, growth and stretching. This is what Malcolm and Marie was all about.Marie had to stand in her insecurity and lack of self approval and fight to be recognized for who she is to Malcolm.Good relationships can help people to grow with this type of interaction. It's not easy and it takes courage, vulnerability and determination. It is not always pretty. This is not a ""they lived happily ever after with no fighting''. This is real stuff!We loved it as we both recognized this writers incredible insight.",Malcolm & Marie
199,Steve-from-Texas,UNBELIEVABLE acting... boring storyline,6,24 February 2021,"The writing and the performances by Zendaya and JB Washington are the ONLY reason I gave this film 6 stars. The chemistry, both love & hate is fantastic. You'll have no problem believing their performances.That being said, I was completely exhausted by the time I finished the movie. If you enjoy watching other couples fight and argue, you might love it. That's what it feels like... like you're a fly on the wall of a 1h 46m fight. I think this would've made an excellent short, but it's simply way too long.My advice??? Watch about half an hour and skip to the end.",Malcolm & Marie

While I can see how some could have a hard time sitting through this, the acting, directing, and overall style to me was spectacular.This is the best I've seen Zendaya and Washington. They captured every emotion I've felt during breakups, the ups and the downs. The directing was phenomenal, I couldn't help but be entranced by the shots throughout.This isn't an exceptionally exciting movie.

Maybe im too old to appreciate her. She still comes across as a 15 year old tying to act adult.And then theres flashes of her same personality i see in interviews trying to act tough and be cool. Didnt mind her in something like Spiderman and i havent seen her in euphoria but i believe she plays a teen so maybe it works.This was a painful 1:45.,Malcolm & Marie

There is no deep in it. All that appears to be wise is obvious basis and not even close to the problem of society. I think that the whole concept didn't work because of the overall fake trippin and lack of message control.Emotional yes. Music awesome. Beautiful people and nice camera angles.Hearting emotions, simple message that claim to be genius. White and black story again. Nothing interesting. No strong ideas. Extravagant, but empty inside.",Malcolm & Marie
204,moore-davidj,Tiresome,5,24 July 2021,Two amazing actors but the film is nothing but a late night drunken argument. The kind that everyone has been in in their past relationships before they learned not to attend every argument that you are invited to and not to try to work out real issues at 2 in the morning after a night of drinking. It was tedious and I feel almost guilty saying so because of the actors in the film who I like so much. Waste of 2 hours. Watch something else.,Malcolm & Marie

So I gave it a shot and well ... I think I was right. It does come across as sometimes pretending to be more than what it is, so I understand the bad reviews. But beyond that, it's just a simple human drama - with pretty loaded dialogue - that artistically presents the complicated dynamic between two flawed people in a romantic relationship.

I didn't liked it, cause Zendaya looks too young for Washington, it seemed that it was no chemistry there ...But as long the movie progresses , it's easy to see how mature Marie is, and how childish Malcolm is, making the perfect match! The arguments are so valid for each part! It's totally understandable than no one wants to give up in a discussion, ever. The acting of both are just remarkable, specially Zendaya, there's nothing she can't do !! The black and white film, works perfectly. The director was great, the actors were great, great movie.

211,thevision-44664,Malcolm and Marie: Movie Review,5,21 February 2021,"If it weren't for the first 50 minutes and some brilliant performance throughout by the leads, i would've given this movie less than this.
The movie is... i don't know what this movie is really. Sam Levinson was just trying to create a dramatic art. Sure it has drama, a lot! Sure it is artistic in a way, but what happened after the first 50 minutes? If you noticed the movie, watched the movie, the way i did, you'll see when the movie started to fall apart.The first half of the movie genuinely hooked me up to watch a new type of Drama. The acting is Brilliant, it's superb. Washington and Zendaya are at their best here. Just classic. I wouldn't even mind if they get multiple nominations or even wins.They essentially gave the tone, gave the movie, that Dramatic Feeling.
But after some time, it was okay to leave the cycle of repetitive arguments. But the director didn't. The movie is just like: They fight a lot, they start cuddling and love, they fight again, they start making love again, the again fight and sooooo on. It became annoying at a context, that i had my earphones in my ears, movie playing on my laps in phone, but my concentration was on my doggie. I was playing with him while the movie was running in back. I wasn't even interested at a point that what would happen now. The way the first half, first 50 minutes opend, it was really brilliant. I really loved them and also thought that the movie would be a great ride. But after that it just became boring and annoying. There was no point of the movie. Levinson didn't focused that the movie had to go somewhere, to achieve a satisfying climax. But instead just kept the arguments on the core. At the end, the climax, the conclusion was sooo unsatisfactory. It made me thought: What was the point of the movie? What just happened? Are there sooo much convolutions and misunderstanding in a relationship? I really don't think so.. and if yes, HOW? LOL the movie made a joke here. All i wanna say, after the first BRILLIANT half, the movie missed the execution and potential. I was even ready to see a Brutal or Negative outcome at a point. But NOTHING HAPPEND IN THE MOVIE! I was bored as hell.. even the arguments, which felt nice in the first half, became boring and sooooo long afterwards. I wasted my 1 hr 40 mins of sleep. And had to wake up my dog just to pass the time.",Malcolm & Marie

. The acting
. The fight sequences

Although Sam Levinson's directing and ability to write compelling and intriguing dialogue are unquestioned, the pacing and overall story of this film are at times completely lost, and makes you wonder what the story is attempting to show.

John David Washington and Zendaya had great chemistry. I believed their relationship. And the plot of the movie is, unfortunately, very relevant in most relationships, where one spouse feels underappreciated.The scenery was beautiful to me! I think I would buy this house as a vacation home or something like that. I also like the effort to make the movie feel like ""Old Hollywood.""The Bad:
Sometimes I felt that Malcom was a bit ""over the top."" He yelled so freaking much, that I felt hoarse after watching this movie.The Ugly:
Whew. Every man knows that you must say THANK YOU to the wifey after a huge accomplishment.Overall this was a decent movie. Great job Zendaya!

One part of the movie i found long and quite annoying was Malcolms rant scene about the ladies review. it felt like it was never going to stop and it felt forced.a scene that really stuck out to me was Zendayas 'thank you' speech at the end of the movie. it was so nice and refreshing to watch and listen to after all the arguments that had happened prior. she did an amazing job and it felt very realistic and you could tell that Marie was hurting deeply.but i must say, this film was very visually pleasing and beautiful. sam levinson did an amazing job cinematically and the shots throughout the film were just spectacular. i found myself complementing every scene. i liked the black and white filter, it made the movie seem calm even though the situations that were happening were very chaotic at some points.overall i did enjoy this film. it was a beautiful movie with very good actors in it, who did an amazing job.",Malcolm & Marie
218,sofiapanicker,Expectations Vs Reality,4,7 February 2021,"I was excited for this movie -- I think we all were. I have loved Zendaya since I was a kid, and even more so in the last couple years as she's made her transition into more mature roles. John David Washington showed real promise in BlacKkKlansman, and I think he is well on his way to making a lasting impression in Hollywood beyond his father's. Sam Levinson has proven himself to be an excellent writer and creative presence with HBO's Euphoria, especially in the most recent bridge episodes.Malcolm & Marie had everything going for it, so what the hell went wrong?I'll preface by saying that the acting and cinematography are the film's strongest elements. People can say whatever they want about the age difference between the two leads (even though there have been much larger ones in other movies, and Zendaya is a full-grown adult), but it's very clear that they both gave their all to the material. Black-and-white aesthetics are my kryptonite when it comes to film, and the intimate setting of Malcolm & Marie allows for that choice to feel warranted. It's eye candy in every sense of the phrase.Malcolm & Marie's issues lie mainly in its script. The emphasis on monologues was definitely necessary to drive the plot forward but unfortunately, they're not always effective. A story this contained should rely heavily on its writing, yet there are too many moments when what the characters are saying feels pre-packaged. I could've lived with the two people the film follows being unlikeable and graining if the screenplay did a better job at making the audience care about them. This script was written in less than two weeks, and it shows.I wanted to love this movie. I was even ready for it to snag a couple Oscar nominations. But this ain't it. It'll be forgotten about, because sadly, too many other movies have done a story like this better (see Richard Linklater's ""Before"" trilogy). The worst part is, this is one of those films that believes it's greater than it really is -- it's the kind of pretentiousness that you can feel as you're watching. I had high hopes for Malcom & Marie, and while it has its moments, they are few and far between.Because this movie was so divided among critics, I suggest that you watch it if you're interested and form your own opinion. If not, then I don't think it's worth your time.",Malcolm & Marie

field but it doesn't help if the materials they're given to work with doesn't correlate or just GETS TOO MUCH.Why didn't it work?Zendaya, playing a model slash retired actress and yet having the vocabulary range of Maya Angelou seemed inauthentic. I could understand that from Malcolm, a writer but not Marie. It felt like the writer was more bent on showing off his words than actually creating an authentic character.JDW on the other hand would've been perfect if only he wasn't so loud all the time. His frustrations got me frustrated and it kept going and going on like a vicious cycle. One question I keep asking is, if there was so little material, why make it last for 106 minutes?All these mismatches ended up making them sound less of who they were supposed to be and more of a medium the writer was using to vent out his 'words'. Which is funny because, isn't that the point?The good acting really came through at various moments but it was always immediately replaced by cringe disconnections due to excessively repetitive expository arguments. The characters never really quite clicked.The only difference between Malcolm & Marie and Before Midnight would probably make Levinson bawl his brains out. Authenticity.",Malcolm & Marie

To me, it falls short on both.The main issue I have with this movie is the casting of Zendaya as the lead actress. Her acting is similar to Brie Larson's. They both are very ""dry"" and boring when delivering lines and both make scenes dull. Zendaya ruined the first Spider-Man film she was in for me with her acting. She is being overly sexualized in this film. She will be forever be looked at as a child to most due to her childish looks. This role should have been played by someone else.The dialog in this movie has powerful messages about Hollywood, but the overdone and uneccesary cursing deducts from it.

I think the reason I just disengaged (I didn't quite complete it so I shouldn't really review it, but felt strongly about what I had seen!) Is because I didn't feel any love between the characters and there was no time to become invested in them so, their constant arguing became irritating and I just didn't care.I watched it when i felt a heighted awareness of things being particularly tough for so many people in the 'real world', so perhaps this is why it felt so shallow and left me cold.

Glad to give Hollywood a glance at the little guys for a change.It was a well casted duo who carried a character driven script in one location, much like a two person play.

I think this film is a good depiction of the dynamics of modern day relationships and the on screen chemistry between the actors is one of the best I've seen in recent times. They go from heated arguments to just about to make love really smoothly and naturally. The film is quite repetitive and is seemingly like mini loops of the same thing but with different arguments.

First of all: John David Washington and Zendaya are OUTSTANDINGLY GOOD. Both deliver a very powerful and emotional performance. At some points the cinematography is also very captivating, and some of the dialogue in combination with the smooth jazz in the backround keeps you interested. That's it. You feel throughout that Malcolm isn't talking to Marie about reviews, it's Sam Levinson who talks to us. I think he's very insecure with his own work and wanted to let off some steam in this one, after getting a horrible review from the LA Times about one of his other films.

Two people literally doing nothing but arguing is a tough sell (especially at 1hr 45 min) but I watched it through, and found myself engaged and entertained through a good chunk of it. The same reasons I enjoyed this movie will be the same others dislike it:1. It's pretentiousThis is a very wordy film. If you don't have an extensive vocabulary, you will feel insulted. While I admit that the verbiage is overdone more than once, Levinson's screenplay lets you know that Malcolm & Marie is for art house lovers, aka ""real movies"". And I appreciate that.M&M is also shot in Black & White (a beautiful choice, but still very pretentious). The cinematography is beautiful.
2. The actingJohn David Washington & Zendaya both killed it based on what they were given (see above point about the screenplay). I expect an Oscar nomination for Zendaya, and at least a Golden Globe nod for Washington, depends on how crowded the field is.3. Sam Levinson's styleAs a fan of Euphoria, I was happy to see Zendaya and Labrinth coming into the fold with Sam. As expected, the movie is sleek with a great soundtrack and editing.
Even with all those positives, this movie isn't about much, so I'll go with a 7. Expect some Oscar nods though.",Malcolm & Marie
246,mariannaserwa,Trying too hard to reference Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut,2,14 February 2021,"Very annoying movie with no plot line and cringe-y cast overacting in every scene. You don't care for them and feel no sympathy whatsoever.The most annoying part is that Sam Levinson seems to think is the only one who has seen movies by Kieslowski, or Kubrick's Eyes wide Shut, and endlessly references them and steals ideas, but in the end serving no point and no climax.Zandaya dressed the same way as Nicole Kidman in Eyes wide Shut, (a brilliant movie I have seen 20 times, with easter eggs hidden along the way, unlike this piece of garbage). Levinson referencing the idea of deep conversations and fights in EWS, but unfortunately to no result, no creative meaning, no point. Zendaya peeing in an evening gown in the first scene (hello?! Again Eyes wide shut). But why??? Makes no sense, in the nineties this was groundbreaking to show this in cinemas, but now?? Nothing interesting, nothing new.I've gotten already pretty annoyed by Levinson using the soundtrack from Kieslowski's Double life of Vernonique in Euphoria, like it was completely new, his idea, without any references. But this movie beats the cake, because it's fake, boring and pointless, at least Euphoria had a story to tell. Perhaps Levinson thinks the only people seeing Malcolm and Marie will be teenies from Euphoria, treating all his ""borrowed"" ideas as new...
Not to mention that the interior and the wide shots from outside the house with Malcolm dancing in the beginning of the movie are a straight copy of Mia dancing to ""Girl, you'll be a woman soon"" in Pulp Fiction....Most cringe-y scenes: Malcolm eating mac & cheese (this scene will hunt you with its annoyance), Zendaya making weird cringe-y faces, making her look like a teenager and not like an intelligent, wise adult, she's supposed to portray.Sorry to say, but as much as I enjoyed Tenet, in this role Washington is also just plainly annoying, full of himself and not a likeable character...

248,nishamilk,Here's my criticism that the movie criticized,7,5 February 2021,"The performances truly made this movie, there was not a moment that I felt Zendaya and John were lacking. The cinematography was good but it is noticeable that the physical restrictions is what formed it. They use wide shots and have the characters make up for the lack of cuts with their movement around the space. The house is supposed to be huge, but I didn't feel that it was - which Sam wanted so that's a good point. The script could only be taken so far, it was lame. There are definitely moments where the characters dig into each other's weaknesses but I don't feel the pain, I don't feel the soul-crushing words. the performances are heartbreaking but the words aren't. I don't know if I should go easier on the filmmaker because of the restrictions or if I should just treated this as any movie. There was hype around this movie and it came off as dull.another thing: the choice of black and white with black characters would have truly showed the lack of effort placed on lighting dark skin but the lighting in this movie was not breathtaking. it was very sharp at some points for a plot that was showcasing emotional complexities and other times it was very monotoned and dull. I changed by brightness as some points just to see if it was me that wasn't viewing it properly",Malcolm & Marie
249,Gn_opinionate,Captures the inexplicable,8,19 February 2021,"Every element of the movie made me feel essentially frustrated and I didin't understand why. However, translating it makes me believe that in relationships there are inexplicable feelings and in my reading this is what the movie is about. It is hard to understand ourselves let alone another person. There are several stories of the huge fights in relationships, but who talks about the feelings? The deep feelings that connect and separate the loving partners at the same time. If you think of an everyday fight between partners, you realize that it is nothing like in the movie, we wish it would be. In life people don't try to understand one another... they shout, break staff and interrupt each other. In the movie, in spite of the tension and contradiction the lovers listen, reflect and react to the other's speech. Most of all I adored the camera angles... the way they presented the distance between the two hears by putting the wall of the house between them, for example. The visual elements speak for themselves and help us understand the wars the characters fight in their souls. Yes, the war should be proclaimed against ourselves because deep down we create it not the other person. The movie consists of a mixture of contrasts: silence, long dialogues; hate, love; hurting, being hurt; woman, man etc. It has a unique atmosphere, lovely scenes, cuts, camera angles. It is pure art. The acting is incredible, they need to present inner pain, built up frustration and at times give irrationally long monologues. I liked the (often negative) feelings and thoughts that emerged in me during the movie, they are worth reflection. After one week, I still catch myself thinking of it so all in all I find it impactful.",Malcolm & Marie
250,wewaj-03329,I agree with others on both sides of being good/bad,5,16 February 2021,"***Spoiler alert!!First, i do want to say that the movie was shot beautifully and i really liked Zandaya as she was really engaging and funny and entertaining. But JDW was just odd in this movie, myself and my gf gave it 45mins, but she couldn't handle it anymore. We get the story, we get the acting, but it was really toxic and for people not in these types of relationships it can be extremely negative and boring. I do like JDW also, but he was a emotional terrorist in this movie and how can you forget to ""thank"" your spouse in a movie that was somewhat based off her?!?! But you happened to thank literally everyone else and even the dog, etc lol... Either way, to each their own, we were expecting more since it was labelled a ""Thriller"" But I'm sorry this is NOT a Thriller type movie. I would just say romance, suspense that's it.

This movie calls back to the early 60's independent arthouse projects when they wanted something less surreal or abstract to draw in more people. It harkens back to scripts from the likes of Ibsen, and on that note can easily be translated to stage.
The acting is top-notch, the language is hard-hitting, and the cinematography is beautiful. It shows that art can easily prevail through even the worst pandemic.

262,diogobulhosa,"We get it Sam Levinton, you can name a lot of Directors.",6,7 February 2021,"Over the past few years, a black and white movie trend has been unveiling itself. ""Malcolm and Marie"", is a modern-day love story, written and directed by Sam Levinton, starring Zendaya and John Washington. Fully shot in black and white, and accompanied by some great pieces of jazz, it unfolds into an unsettling discussion, about adulthood, Hollywood, racism, sexism, and love.The film begins with a questionable opening scene, and although it does its purpose, introduces us to our main characters, main topic, and the set, it feels empty and somewhat senseless. Malcolm, a young and upcoming filmmaker, who has just premiered his first positively criticized movie, and his partner Marie, a failed actress, that ended up becoming a model, and has a very shady past after some drug-related problems earlier in her life. Both set the mood for a strong heart-to-heart argument between them that lasts the whole movie. Zendaya worked with Sam Levinton in his successful streaming show, ""Euphoria"", and John had just recently worked with Cristopher Nolan in his 2020 blockbuster ""Tenet"".As I see it, the movie is an authentic acting challenge. Two actors filling the screen for almost two hours is astonishing, and something to take into consideration before criticizing the acting. With that said, Zendaya was by far superior to John Washington. Just like in ""Tenet"", John Washington takes too long to adapt himself to the movie, and only half away thought it he levels with the amazing actress that Zendaya is. But above all, I believe blaming the actors would be unfair. The argument is, to say the least, horrible. It's pretentious and wants to be so much more than what it needs to. Sam Levinton must have some trauma with critics, and although some truth about the Hollywood world is in fact said, most of it feels like the writer wanting to show how much more he knows about cinema than his critics. There is no doubt in my mind, that this movie was pressured to hit the one hour and forty-five-minute mark.As far as cinematography goes, the camera work is mediocre, with some very interesting shots, but nothing truly beautiful, until the very last five minutes, where there is a game of mirrors, that I am yet to understand, which creates a brilliant shot. This is also followed by the last plan of the film, which fits perfectly with the black and white, and ends the movie in a beautiful style. The music is very good, with some very interesting choice of tracks, apart from in the opening scene where the jazz tune is, in my opinion, out of sync with the camera work. Saving the most important for last, the black and white. Does it make sense? Yes, I believe the black and white is used to emphasize the two characters, the two personalities, that argue throughout the movie and reveal themselves to us, and that is in fact a very good idea and something that I enjoyed. In spite of this, it's so badly done. When you watch movies like ""Roma"" or ""Cold War"" you marvel at their black and white, it's truly beautiful. But in ""Malcolm & Marie"" it just disappointing. It's empty and brings no impact to the movie. Once again, it seemed to me that it was just another pretentious move by Sam Levinton.All things considered, it was an average movie, a bold and very challenging concept from Sam Levinton that could have been a cinema milestone, but in the end, it does not surpass mediocracy.",Malcolm & Marie

firstly may i say i am so impressed with the dialogue in it, and the fact that with only Zendaya & John alone as cast, managed to pull a masterpiece.
one would say that that's very considerate given the fact that we're in a pandemic, i say: that's all he needed anyway.here's my speculation on the movie:Malcom (Sam as a producer) Marie (Sam's past as an addict)
it seems to me like Sam is arguing with himself in the movie; Marie was angry at the fact that he didn't thank her for the influence she had on his film, while he thanked everyone else.
Malcom apologizes and argues back that it wasn't ONLY about her, and starts to mention other people and situations.

275,sierrafashion,Just because it stars Zendaya doesn't mean it's good,3,6 February 2021,"I honestly love Zendaya she's one of my favorite actress but I was very disappointed when I saw the trailer. I decided not the judge the movie too harshly just by the trailer so I gave it a shot. It's was extremely boring and slow moving. Just because it stars Zendaya doesn't automatically mean it's good. It was stretched out way too long. If it was on color,had more cast members,and was around 30-45minutes or so. I would of liked it much more. The story line is extremely basic and has no appeal what so ever. 3 stars for the ability to stretch out angsty argument throughout 2 people for an hour and 46 minutes and get it on Netflix. If Zendaya wasn't in this I bet this movie would be getting the same rating numbers of KUWTK.",Malcolm & Marie

I never thought that movie with two actors would be so good. I only had a occasion to see John David Washington in this film and in ""Tenet"" and in both roles he did great (but I love this scene when he went outside and talked to himself and monologue about critics), but Zendaya... oh, I fell in love with Marie.

It reminded me in content, style and its beautifully film black & white of the 1966 Mike Nichol's film WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOF? if Honey and Nick had not been invited back to the house. The fears and foibles of the two leads are gradually exposed through both intense and comedic scenes that are both thoughtful and entertaining.A lot of hate is being directed at this terrific film which is a total amazement to me.",Malcolm & Marie
283,pharaohseye,"Stunning, eclectic, moving and inherently insightful.",10,10 February 2021,"Years ago, Moonlight won the Academy's Best Motion Picture. To this day I struggle to understand why. Nevertheless, Malcolm & Marie could sweep a few Oscar categories and I'd fully understand it without effort.Those who refer to this film as being just an hour long argument are simply lost amidst the brilliance of its cinematic parlance. Malcolm & Marie is a viable study of the human condition with such genuine ferocity that it can be complicated to digest if one comes to this film with preconceived notions.I would venture a guess that there isn't a relationship of any kind, lasting more than one full year, that hasn't digressed at some point into something that resembles the tumult and pain of Malcolm & Marie-if even only for a fleeting moment. There is a realness and familiarity to these characters. We've seen them in ourselves. Perhaps in our parents. Our in-laws or other relatives.This film is often uncomfortable to watch. It slaps us with pain, empathy and raw emotion. And despite that reality, it is hard to put down.The nearly monochromatic grayscale approach serves to focus the viewer quite myopically on the two characters that dominate the screen. The choice is obvious yet subtly self-serving. A prism devoid of color. A reticle into their life. Not relying solely on the impeccable script, the adept recitation of its every emotion and monologues by Washington and Zendaya, Levinson thrusts the chaotic and strained dynamic between the characters into the faces and psyches of the viewer.Both characters are fractured in ways that are irreparable, inseparable and inconceivable. We feel their pain. We live their antagonism. We struggle with them to come out of the endless loop of loved-laced lunacy that permeates their reality. This is a film that makes those in the room constantly glance at one another in complete dismay and accordance.I've talked about this film abstractly so as not to produce spoilers, but rather to entice those on the fence to watch it and really open themselves to its cold, disturbing embrace. Yes, some professional critics are panning this film as exhaustive and laughable. Truth be told, those are the very critics whose review work I find to be both.There is nothing laughable about this film. But it's impact can prove exhausting. Because it strikes the heart with a massive thump that takes one's breath away.This is a genius piece of filmmaking. There is something new, fresh and remarkably approachable about this movie. It's chock full of complex monologues. It embodies dizzying shifts in temperament and tone and culminates in a triumphant climax that makes you want to turn off the TV and just contemplate it out of reverence.Bravo! That was worth every second. Especially the two Oscar worthy performances.",Malcolm & Marie

286,integrityone,Realistic,7,14 February 2021,This movie is good because relationship are like this. They are able to express themselves by speaking how they actually feel. Real love is being able to speak truth no matter how harsh it may be. They are actually friends and lovers. That is why they are able to talk this way about each other and still get alone.

288,luis151,Great acting and great cinematography,6,7 February 2021,"That is why I rate it a 6/10.
Starting with the screenplay, the dialogue between the two characters sounds a little off and over the top. It doesn't feel real and it just sound flat because the movie tries to come across as 'artsy' so they don't really say anything true or meaningful. The movie starts with a fight between the couple and ends with a fight and in between these 2 fights, you guessed it there's more fights. By repeating it self over and over the movie becomes a little boring.
If you have seen the movie there's one scene where Malcolm starts talking about a review and it just goes on and on and it just looks like Sam Levinson has some hate bottled against some critics so this scene is kinda weird and doesn't particularly fit.
All in all the acting was great and the moments where Marie isn't talking her face says it all and its there where Zandaya truly shines. John also shows his immense talent and delivers a fine performance.",Malcolm & Marie

293,magsmovies,Too pretentious to be genuine,5,8 February 2021,"Nobody talks like this in the middle of a heated argument, especially with alcohol involved. The passion was there in the physical acting, but the verbose lines felt entirely too premeditated and rehearsed to be delivered organically as they would be in a spontaneous lover's spat. They just take turns spouting off eloquently composed diatribe. Cinematography is the one redeeming quality. Beyond that, I couldn't get past the toxicity of their psychological jabs to find the takeaway of this abusive character study with no resolution. In summation: TLDR; Relationships are messy and Sam Levinson's grudge for Katie Walsh runs deep.",Malcolm & Marie
294,adamboykin,Like father like son,7,6 February 2021,"John David Washington continues to show his dominant and powerful presence as an actor and how prevalent he can be on the screen. Zendaya was not outshined by John David Washington however as she gives a very strong and heartfelt performance. These two actors showed their range, emotion, and talent incredibly well. The writing could have been really bad if it were different actors in the role however John David Washington and Zendaya made some bad lines seem good purely off their performance and talent.Malcolm & Marie depicts emotional trauma, resentment, lust, fame, and heartache in a relationship and the affects it can cause in a fantastic way. Each character has their own monologues about the relationship, their life, or past trauma or past relationships that brutally hurts the other person. The film shows how all of these things in a relationship are detrimental to both people and how it forms toxic emotional attachment which is unhealthy for both people to be in.Where the film falls short is in the run time. This film is not long it stands at an hour and forty six minutes and towards the end of the last act it feels like it is dragging on and they are arguing or talking about the same thing. If this film were a little shorter then it would have had a better impact on people but the end of the film took so long it kind of makes you not invested. Other than that this film has really good Oscar worthy performances and has really great themes throughout!",Malcolm & Marie
295,gbradley-03098,Great acting carries a mediocre film,6,14 February 2021,"A film filled with emotion but devoid of purpose, Malcom and Marie always felt like it was going somewhere only to return to the same tedious argument. Perhaps that's the point, that the couple is stuck on this and will never get over it, but as a viewer I grew bored of it after an hour. Zendaya and Washington had beautiful monologues containing passion and true acting skills, but the film really should've been 45 minutes to an hour maximum. The second half was just rehashing the first, and I feel a shorter form would've made this a much more profound work of art.",Malcolm & Marie

Although Malcolm eats like a drunk making way too much irritating noises for no apparent reason, he talks like a thespian on stage.

298,slp-65008,Malcolm and Marie,8,9 February 2021,"This movie isn't going to be for everyone. But that doesn't mean it's not an excellent movie.Our two stars return home from a premiere of Malcolms where an argument ensues after Malcolm forgets to thank Marie during his speech. Like a scab you can't stop picking, each character can't help but go back to push the line of hurting their partner one more time.The film delivers heavy hitting psychological jabs simply through the dialogue. It makes us question what it means to critique others intentions, it makes us question what our race plays in opinions and analysis, and it subjects us to many other complex issues solely through well performed dialogue with stunning noir cinematography.For those that have seen Euphoria, you'll have witnessed the writing ability of Levinson before. Levinson has shown with Malcolm and Marie that his talent goes even further, and that he's got a pythonic grip on reality with a superb talent for nudging audiences to reevaluate theirs.Both leads gave excellent performances. The only gripe I have with the casting unfortunately would be that although Zendaya gave an incredible performance, she looks too young to be playing Marie. Marie is meant to have been a junkie at the age of 20 but is now ""recovered"", Zendaya looks slightly too young and fresh faced as she only looks 20-22 on screen, because the dialogue constantly mentions the age of her drug induced years, it was just too hard to ignore - curse you beautiful skin! Regardless, this shouldn't take away from her performance and it is another weapon to add to her artillery of great work over the past few years.",Malcolm & Marie

304,chrisdannie,One Person Carried The Entire Movie... Can You Guess?,6,9 February 2021,"I want to start by saying that I LOVE Zendaya as an actress, I mean since a child she has had such a cute, genuine approach to every single role that she portrays. I mean how many actresses do you know that can go from a drugged out teen to a super hero one? She is AMAZING... But I don't think pitting her up against John Washington in this film was fair on any account. First of all, John's energy throughout the entire film, gave a sense of urgency and realism while Zendaya's character seemed very performative the entire time. And I understand that her character was meant to be ""weak"" to some extent, but during an argument, when someone is coming at you with that amount of fire in their words, no person in a serious relationship is going to be that willing to just cry and listen. I say this not because he is the son of Denzel, but because he carried the role, and the movie with such grace that kept you intrigued: He carried this movie all by himself. From listening to his music in the beginning, it was so real and honest, to the hurtful words he was saying while Marie was in the bathtub even to the subtleness of apologizing to Marie and finally thanking her like she asked, it was all open and real. Yes, relationships are messy and there is always going to be one person who is the ""dominant"" but Maries character was much to unrealistic in this movie.

Yes, real people don't talk as smoothly but isn't that the point? What if you could be a fly on the wall during a poetic argument between two beautiful people in their beautiful home?

307,lucascoluccioinostroza,50 minutes,7,5 February 2021,"Sincerely ""Malcolm and Marie"" was a film that I waited for a while with longing and good expectations, as I longed to see John David Washington and Zendaya together in a film.
I liked very much the direction that this film had, with plane-sequences that gave nature to the interpretations. Another good point to note is that the performances of both actors have enchanted me, John David Washington and Zendaya are the best of the film and somehow ""save"" it and make it better than it could have been without these two actors.
but unfortunately the film did not convince me completely, because, (although it has a good format to tell the story) I only enjoyed approximately the first 50 minutes of the movie (in which I really had a great time and did not take an eye off the TV), but the rest of the film was somewhat boring, had unnecessary and irrelevant dialogues which could have been better, certainly this was what made me give this rating to ""Malcolm and Marie"" and not a higher one, which I wish I had done.",Malcolm & Marie

I felt the whole movies was forced to be artistic but it is not.

They used big words that no one ever use in a fight. There whole part about the filmmaker complaining from the critics is so forced.. i felt it was so irrelevant to the whole story.
The whole of black and white, is kind of forced so people would feel that it is a deep artistic movie, while in fact i felt it was so shallow.
For example, marriage story was a movie about couples arguing and was so authentic than this one, we would be lessening marriage story if we compare it to this one.
Zendaya's acting was disturbing.. i felt she was also forcing the drama, and forcing the reactions, there was something so weird about the way she talks and reacts.At the end i guess that if this movie is divided into separate stories, in a separate short film, it would be much better.",Malcolm & Marie

No inhibitions. Very raw and real. That doesn't happen in the real world and that was the beauty of this film for me. I was intrigued from start to finish. However, I do agree that this may have been better as a short film because the argument was too long, relentless, cruel, and exhausting making it a bit unrelatable. Nobody in their right mind is sitting through an argument that long, that calmly especially in a drunken state. Lengthy arguments this heated escalate pushing people into a state of rage or emotional instability. It did not escalate enough to justify the length. If Zendaya was sitting in the bathtub ""at least"" reflecting the thoughts of physical retaliation instead of just sitting there taking it, that would have added the needed transition the film lacked at this length.",Malcolm & Marie

What it seems to begin with small problem turns out to be a roller coster of emotions that both wanted to scream at each other.I find it a little bit repetitive but when the fights rekindles they always have good arguments, but the tiredness stops once you realise the love for each other throughout the movie and especially her love in the end.
It's a movie that clearly transmits the relationship and the stories of the protagonists I think those ideas are very clear and congratulations to the actors and writers.Finally it's a very fluid movie the idea and message could be transmitted in less time but overall it0s a great effort and movie.Thank you and nice films!",Malcolm & Marie

Not being new to the situation depicted, I think it gives me much to think about. There's just so much to the relationship dynamic that shows when two are fighting.

327,justjuliaa34,"Pretentious, Repetitive, Self-Important",3,2 April 2021,"Was looking forward to this movie because I am typically a fan of dialogue-heavy slice of life films and I was excited to see Zendaya and John David Washington. I thought the characters were great, but the story really fell short- it quickly became over the top and repetitive. It seemed like Sam Levinson wanted to flex his knowledge of film and make pretentious declarations about art. Disappointed.",Malcolm & Marie
328,megbee,Heartbreaking and real,7,30 March 2021,"I'm watching this movie thinking to myself, ""if a man ever spoke to me that way, I wouldn't tolerate it. I would simply leave."" But truth is, men have talked to me this way. I've been in countless relationships like this where I ride the roller coaster because the highs outweigh the lows. But do they really? And in the back of my head I'm thinking, I'll leave next time, if it gets worse. This film clearly wasn't very liked by critics, and I can understand why in some cases. They claim the movie is shallow, too pretentious to be genuine, but ultimately, it perfectly captures what it's like to be in an emotionally and verbally abusive relationship. Where the carrousel never stops and you don't even really know what's keeping you from jumping off. It's well written, a little too well written, yes, but it tells a story that many people can relate to.",Malcolm & Marie
329,Icecoldheart,"Like a beautiful play, captured on 35mm film.",8,10 February 2021,"If you go into this film thinking it's an adapted theatre piece, you are going to really appreciate it. Being aware that it was set during a few hours of this couples night, that it was an intimate look into their lives, it was truely special. The blocking of each scene is so meticulously mapped out despite it looking so natural. The way there able to frame each character, like one character walking into frame by a mirror and the other leaning by a door frame, purely beautiful composition. And yet upon reading about the film, I see that some of the scenes had improvised blocking with a hand hold camera capturing each moment. In fact the first two days of footage for the opening scene was cut out in favour of a more relaxed improvised version, which spurred Zendaya to turn to John David Washington and say, 'This is how he works"". This film comes from Sam Levinson the creator and main director on the HBO hit 'Euphoria', and you can really see that the man has a way to beautifully capture a performance. He has a way to make each frame look so alluring and eye catching. You could tell Levinson has a short hand with his cinematographer Marcell Rév and the rest of the crew (from Euphoria) to pull off such a seamless film during a pandemic. Each shot is filmed and edited so harmoniously, with not a single shot or scene out of place. The pacing and dialogue is on point. And boy oh boy the driving vehicle of the film is of course the two powerhouse performances by Zendaya and John David Washington. They both have palpable chemistry that makes your heart skip a beat when each character says something cruel about one another. They both portray very complex and troubled characters. I've loved each of these actors for a while now, and I have to say foreseeably they smashed this project out of the park. I had moments where I despised Malcom, for what he said to Marie and moments that I relished of his (like his entrance/ dance scene). Zendaya's Marie at points seems unstable and yet the most rational in a scene. This film whilst fundamentally about a complex relationship, is in my opinion more geared toward people that either love cinema, or perhaps are an artist themselves. It is definitely a film that will please actors and filmmakers as they can appreciate both the way it was created and the way it was beautifully performed. But calling this film an art house piece is predictable. I mean come on it's filmed on 35mm black and white film! - Follow Ofcourse That's Cinema on Instagram, Vero and YouTube for more!",Malcolm & Marie
330,nakisnakis,Surprisingly captivating,7,7 February 2021,"Starring only two people in one setting (their house), I wasn't expecting a masterpiece but trailer had me hooked and the whole thing seemed interesting.I put it on to play while I was working on the laptop and suddenly I was captivated. Black and white makes the people stand out and their performances are great (they are also both stunningly beautiful). The whole movie is basically one big fight, so normal and so exaggerated at the same time, with all the breaks, the pauses, the deep cuts a normal fight between two people in love would have. It makes you feel and remember emotions from your life even if your background is not similar to theirs, you will feel them.Overall, it's a nice work, its different than most movies out there and this is what it makes it stand out. Zendaya and John David Washington are so great without being too much, they make it feel like an everyday couple having a fight.7/10 because the couple is great and it all feels natural and real.",Malcolm & Marie

In January we had The Sit, an informational, beautiful and peaceful movie, but in February the big movie is Malcom & Marie, which felt actually pretty big. Even the title itself reminds us of the tragical classic couples like Romeo & Juliet, Tristan & Isolde, anticipating a powerful conflict. It felt nice to see Zendaya actually playing a role which matches her acting standard, and I believed her, she truly deserves more serious role from now on. John David Washington's performance is a delight to watch and his strangely chaotic stile of acting really catches you. The fact that is filmed black-white amplifies the conflict and keep it there. I couldn't get enough of the protagonists' sharp lines and the knife scene is G O L D, not going to say more.

I thought the visual style was very nice with some interesting choice of shots and visuals. The acting from John David Washington was also quite good, I didn't think Zendaya was as good.However, the story has no depth. In a film, you are supposed to sympathize with characters and go through their journey and change, but here I found myself hating both characters. They simply didn't seem like good people so I didn't care for them. They argue over and over about the same thing, they swear too much to attempt to add intensity and the story doesn't really take different turns. It feels like a theater piece with musical interludes.If you have a story to tell, make a film. If you have nice pictures to show, make a photo album.",Malcolm & Marie

It was disturbing to see him throw tantrums just because he couldn't read a movie review.There's a scene where Malcolm talks about Black directors and racism it felt inauthentic.

In the begging of the movie i was wondering why this couple have no chemistry but quick realized that's kinda of the point. Is a deep hurt couple, they are so full of each other and that need to be reflected someway.
Is not my favorite movie but i think is a good one, is true and real.
I can understand why so many people didn't liked it, the script is heavy and and the theme is not easy to watch. You are literally watching a couple fight. They are not likable, they are not perfect, they are just two human beings.
About the performance of the two verry talented actors, i enjoyed, they dont make you feel good but that's the point, because the characters are not well, they are not good people, or bad, they are what they are and the actors put there so well on the screen. They are not trying to you like them, they are fighting to each other, simply as that.

I don't believe anyone speaks with such eloquence in real life, especially in a fight where your emotions take over. It is a shame, as this could have been a potentially good short film. In addition, the scenes were stretched to the point they didn't make sense anymore. Malcolm's entire rant about the review was too overdone and it felt like the writer only tried to make every scene longer to get to a two hour film. Also, I feel as though the writer tried to hard to come across as artistic and original and made it seem very fake. All in all, it is watchable and a good way to see what mistakes to look out for when writing a script.",Malcolm & Marie

I would dare to say that it is the best performance of zendaya in her career. For me it is more difficult to convey and connect to the audience through expression than screaming and crying and that is something that zendaya does in a phenomenal way and brilliantly achievedNow as for the story, although not anywhere, that is not worthy of saying that it is bad because as the premise of the film is that this is not a love story, it is a story about love and how it changes in our lives. with that someone and as always there will be fights on the way.That verse is in my opinion something very important in the film and that without it it could not be appreciated as it deservesthe cinematography is good it is not fantastic and sometimes I think they did not know how to take advantage of the black and white format but that is my only criticismthe performance is captivating, the direction falls in love, a true story about how love really is",Malcolm & Marie

I was curious to see what unfolded and how they resolved their disagreements.I found Marie's dialogue to be at times too complicated with the use of complex words which threw me off sometimes.

It was so real and present for the way we as audience could dig into the souls and emotions of the two main characters.I do believe that Zendaya is one of the best contemporary actresses, but nine star out of ten because I felt she was too young for the role. Don't get me wrong, knowing that she was there was one of the main reasons I wanted to watch this movie, but it took me a while to accept her character and really enjoy the narrative.It was a rollercoaster of emotions and pain, pain that I felt mostly for Marie than for Malcolm.

Well-shot and well-directed, it looked liked a ""high-end disagreement"", and amidst the pettiness between two lovers their environment blends well with their situation, the mood right from start glued me to my screen from start to finish.Both actors did an amazing job and huge part of it is because of the superb writing, but I see people criticizing the chemistry between Zendaya and John, and I honestly believe Zendaya is a very replaceable part of the film, but nonetheless she did great and delivered her best performance of her acting career, John is so versatile and honestly, he could be a leading man of an another romantic film.

The point of this movie is to relate and understand these two characters.

383,mardineed,Amazing,10,7 February 2021,"This movie is made so smart, music vibration to manipulate the emotions, it allows you to feel everything they feel, I feel like I can close my eyes and feel and listen to everything.Very beautifully made, I must say this is best movie I've seen in very long time.Just breathtakingly beautiful",Malcolm & Marie
384,julissajay-48887,If you lack depth.. you won't get it.,10,7 February 2021,"This movie is phenomenal and if anyone says otherwise, it's because they're lying to themselves and still think relationships are sunshines and rainbows. This movie captures what it's like to be REALLY in love past the honey moon stage. It's raw; it's not a dipiction of some false reality of love. It doesn't portray toxicity like some of the reviews I've seen claims. It portrays two people who understand DEPTH, whilst one (Marie) actually understand their own trauma. Toxic would look like two people projecting their mental issues, past traumaS, and emotional baggage all day long. However, this is RAW In that the sense that two people are trying to rack through the mist and muck of their emotions, with logic nonetheless. If you're one who understands their own psychology, whilst understands their partner's, while all the while remaining grounded, you'll understand this movie fully. But if all you know of is booty calls, ""situationships"" , and trauma bonding, the message goes right over your head. Poor souls.",Malcolm & Marie
385,shuntezhayes,An alright film,4,7 February 2021,I love the fact that they made the two actors highly intelligent however the film went no where in my opinion. In my opinion it was a bit cringe. However Zendeya looked absolutely breathtaking. The movie was just corny. Spoiler all they did was argue but in an intelligent way.,Malcolm & Marie
386,kntjehv,Great,10,8 February 2021,This movie was beautiful! I felt like they both deserve an award for the acting considering how differ they are from the characters.

388,tallulahdenyer,"Tedious, titillating and turbulent",4,9 February 2021,"Malcolm and Marie is a pulchritudinous, realistic but suffocating film about an ostentatious, navel-gazing filmmaker (John David Washington) and his recovering addict, relentless girlfriend (Zendaya) that come home after Malcolm's (Washington) first movie premiere. During the film the couple toxically argue over and over, make up, tease the audience with a sex scene and Marie (Zendaya) exhaustingly and frustratingly starts arguing with Malcolm again. It's a cycle that becomes more monotonous every time it begins. Within half an hour it becomes conspicuous that this is going to be the entire narrative. Despite this, cinematically it is beautiful and unique in appearance and has that quality of a ""film having a heart"", to quote Malcolm. An excellent film for filmmakers; but a tedious one for everybody else.",Malcolm & Marie

It obviously wasn't going to be a love story, and pretty much the entire trailer they were arguing aswell.This movie was very well written, and wow the acting was incredible. Zendaya's and Washington's performance is what makes this movie what it is, is was so... perfect. From the monologues to them just sitting silent next to eachother, it was all perfect, and the best acting I've seen in a while.",Malcolm & Marie

When I read the reviews and the rating all I can say is if it was Jennifer Anniston and Brad Pitt it would have received a 99% rating across the board. If Malcolm and Marie were killing each other the ratings would go through the roof, as that is how the audience likes to see Black people-killing each other but loving each other and portraying a couple going through relationship challenges and facing them out loud is probably a bit too high of a level for small minded people to get their heads around and understand the intelligence of the acting and the script.Go rate your next sci-fi movie and stay out of real people in a real world.""",Malcolm & Marie

People keep saying the dialogue doesn't seem ""real"" but these are two characters who work in theater and film. This type of dialogue is VERY real and believable. This was an amazingly crafted film.

I watched it on a whim because I know the actors involved usually give good performances and I thought we shall see where this goes. The accuracy to which this film depicts domestic back and forth is like nothing else I've seen recently. The reviews saying this is dull are coming from those either single or not use to seeing drama without realty show pauses in between. This is life people, it's messy and it's boring and if your black and happen to frequent mostly white spaces, it might involve using the term ""white lady"" on more than a few occasions. Also the camp of entertainment critics providing negative reviews as a way to close ranks because he apparently called out one of your own. Get over your selves because while your head was so far up some place it doesn't belong you missed the Brilliant way this film depicts how a couple shapes one another, how with each argument they were growing becoming something more. This want just a couple going after each other. This was two people breaking each other down to the studs and rebuilding something new in its place. A higher respect for women. A new enthusiasm for life. A better work ethic. Better drive. Stronger determination. Gratitude. Appreciation and the unity at the end was not lost on me either. This was a solid film!

It forces you to look at each character's perspective. Their raw emotions. The relationship is real. Not some feel good fake rom com. You experience from Malcom and Marie every sting and barb they throw, soul shattering introspection, regretful words thrown out in anger defeat, their humiliations, insecurities and their love. Doing this film in black and white was brilliant. The void of color doesn't distract you from their narrative. It makes you focus on it. I cannot say enough about it. This was my revolutionary film.

402,tonyfp,Misunderstood,7,21 February 2021,"In my opinion this film is not as much about the relantionship as i first thought.I feel like their relantionship problems are what keeps the film interesting for most spectators but the the directors true objective was to critique some things about the film industry and specially the way they are perceived. The points made are really good and gave me a new perspective so i really enjoyed that side of the movie.The writing was too eloquent making the fight a little bit unrealistic. I feel like that was a sacrifice by the director as he wanted to make his points very clear and in a normal fight no one woud be able to make such points so clearly.In conclusion, it is not an easy movie to digest as it can get a little bit too repetitive. It is worth watching nevertheless as it makes you think and also keeps you curious all throughout the movie.",Malcolm & Marie
403,libbylbroadfoot,"One of the most incredible films I've ever seen, with consistently stunning cinematography",10,1 March 2021,"This film is beautifully written, the cinematography was truly stunning, very single shot was like a painting. I've read through many of the reviews on here and there is a clear divide between people who recognise this incredible film as a work of art and people who think it's too boring or too long or too wordy. I see why this film may not be for everyone if you prefer action or fast past films, but its unfortunate they think it makes it a bad movie. The conversations are powerful, the true emotions in a arguement are presented so accurately and artful, I felt the pain the characters were feeling. This is a brilliant example of the extraordinary work a collection of talented people can produce. Labrinth's music is used so elegantly as a form of communication, the cinematographer's use of depth and framing in doorways, mirrors, windows to create visual barriers between the characters is exceptional, I was constantly in awe of this. Both Zendaya and John's acting was so powerful and moving, even in scenes of them silent, barely doing anything I simply couldn't take my eyes off the screen. People are complain because this isn't a conventional film, but millions of underrated art is dismissed because people are too lazy to interpt it. This is a film that wants to make you feel something, and I've never been so moved by a film. Thank you for making this, with the challenges of small crew and the pandemic you've created one of the greatest films, a true film with true emotion.",Malcolm & Marie
404,nicoleneolivier,Crytical eyes find deeper meanings,7,3 March 2021,"I am a film student at the Univeraity of Pretoria in South Africa. A friend of mine asked me to watch Sam Levinson's film Malcolm & Marie, to provide her with some depth to understand the film as she couldn't make sense of it. This review is strictly my own opinion.The use of black & white and one location places emphasis on the characters and their emotions. The isolation of the characters from the outside world makes it very intimate, private and timeless. This makes the viewer feel like an intruder, but also demands the viewers attention throughout the film.The modern fancy lifestyle portrayed is the ""mask"" they wear in public, how they want the world to see them. The ""American dream"" however there is some disturbing emtional depth to these characters.
Marie and Malcolm portrays each others inner demons.As they talk to each other the viewers get to know each character so well that it becomes uncomfortable to watch because we all have demons to fight within ourselves and this is exactly what both characters are going through. It is as though Malcolm is Marie's subconcious and Marie is Malcolm's subconcious because they talk about each other's insecurities, fears and weaknessess on such a personal level that it almost seems like something they would tell themselves, one could call it the ""dark side"" of each character.The repetition of the fighting portrays the endless fight we have with ourselves as we go through life, physically and psychologically.The topic of conversation is not as important in this film as the things they say to each other but it does bring about a lot of insecurities in both characters as if it triggers their emotions.During the long pauses between fights they begin to face their own truths, then only true love become evident between and within both charactersThis film was made in the early stages of the COVID pandemic. A time where we were all isolated, a time where I myself had conversations about how much self reflection this year had forced me to do.The characters made it through this timeless evening of inner and outer conflict, facing their own truths and finding ways to love each other regardless of the circumstances. It may be argued that it is about true love, but maybe we need to crytically self reflect in order to truely love ourselves in the deepest of our forms.",Malcolm & Marie

And as you enter in the film, you start to laugh with them, be worried with them, understand each point they make until... the scene of the 'jealousy of Marie' ( when she asked why she wasn't cast). The scene is so terribly plaid that it was even difficult continuing watching the film.

416,julia-d-dimitrova,Beautiful film,10,5 February 2021,"I waited all night to watch this movie.
First of all I really like that it is black and white, because one can actually concentrate on the emotional dynamics. The whole movie is about those dynamics and in my eyes the way that the actors executed it all is brilliant. I think that all the people that see this piece only as a two-hour fight just fail to see the emotional journey that this film takes us through. I personally as a person that has been in a toxic relationship can really relate to many things I saw.
Another thing that i find so good about this film is that you don't know what's coming next. It is not predictable. I also laughed.. but because it was sad.
I admired Zendaya before this movie, now even more so. John is now also in my favorite list.

I also do understand why this isn't a movie that will be liked by everyone, still I thought it was the most interesting discussion about race, cinema and relationships that I have ever watched on screen.It is more than a movie about relationships, there is a lot more hidden in the dialog. It is not a movie to be watched sitting back waiting for drama to escalate between the two characters until the great ending presents itself, glorious and full of emotion and absolution.I was really surprised to watch a movie like this on Netflix, and I do understand why the reviews are so low, since the people on the platform are not expecting this approach to cinema being shown in such a commoditized way.",Malcolm & Marie

432,telmamariapaz,A good movie with great potential that has fallen short,6,5 February 2021,"I must say I was really excited to get immersed in this movie as I saw the trailer, especially seeing Zendaya had a part in it.
Overall, the movie is engaging, shows an awesome acting and performance, the cinematics are on point and the soundtrack is good. For me the win in this is definitely the dialogue that is taken to a very deep yet rational level. You witness the deconstruction of two people analyzing each others points of view and feelings while making a reflection on how they perceive and see each other. Also, how those very same perspectives and behaviors affect them.I think it has a different format from the usual and the way it centers on the psychological realm of two individuals battling to be heard and understood makes it very fascinating and intriguing to watch.On the other hand, I believe the pace of the movie throws away most of the beauty. It quickly switches between intense/loud and calm, with the repetition of these two dimensions becoming exhausting and sometimes dull.The strategic exclusion of some scenes would have elevated the movie and originated a more balanced and gradual development of the plot, keeping the spectator interested. This aspect reveals a certain disappointment, leaving you imagining what could have been a great movie if the duration was reduced and the events sequence was more harmonious.",Malcolm & Marie

People who say it had no plot missed the whole point of the film. It was a beautiful character sketch of a relationship on the brink that was not only connectable for the viewer, but at times raw and emotional. Zendaya and Washington both give brilliant performances with some of the best monologues I have witnessed on screen. The review monologue was hilarious and then I found myself wanting to cry 4 minutes later.

Either way I decided to give it a chance since I am a big fan of both actors, and I am so glad that I did! The relatable characters and the pure emotion that they put into their performances removed the assumption of pretentiousness. The script is truly captivating and tells an honest story. There is a perfect mix of humor, anger, and reflection written into the script. Normally I get bored of movies that take place in one location, but oh my god I could not take my eyes of this film. The performances were so raw and captivated how difficult relationships can be under the right stressors. I saw pieces of myself in Marie, and I think the character depicted the feelings of insecurity and lack of self love that one can experience throughout a relationship. Highly recommend !!!",Malcolm & Marie
438,vladvbv,Excruciatingly Worth It,9,7 February 2021,"This film had me pausing every 15 minutes or so to take a breather from the discomfort it made me feel. Every up has an inevitable, deeper low taking you further down the path of the reality of some relationships. I prayed for make-up sex to put an end to the cross-fire but it never came. Each fight sequence uncovered a new depth to Malcolm and Marie's characters and history, plunging me down stairs of sympathy, resentment, and ultimately, desperately waiting for it to all be over, one way or another. This movie is real, aside from several interactions that felt too scripted and rehearsed, it digs deep, exposing the fact that conflict isn't linear, getting worse until everything's better. It is brutally dynamic and ironically beautiful the way these characters can ultimately keep their heads above the crashing waters of verbal warfare, recognizing and appreciating the beauty in each other, acknowledging out of pocket faults sooner than later. I felt truly trapped in the home this film takes place in and suffocated by the night that seems to drag on forever. The music choices were tasteful and each shot felt like the line between a nightmare and a dream. Zendaya and John Washington killed their performances and more often than not I became oblivious to the fact that this was scripted and acted rather than occurring before my eyes. Many of the camera angles chosen spoke louder than words and the black and white result made this movie feel timeless, although the subject matter couldn't be further from ""black and white"". Please watch this film but brace for impact.",Malcolm & Marie

I do not think that many people will appreciate a movie like this due to its appearance of simplicity. But this film was both simple and complex at the same time. It's all about the ""Why"" with this movie. Zendaya (who i feel is a very very underrated actress) delivers a top notch performance. She shows her true versatility as an actress. Meanwhile JDW is really coming into his own (although at times if you close your eyes you hear his Dad's voice, he seems to be the next up and coming actor). At times it is crazy, calm, loving, hateful, vindictive, spiteful and more. But, it does a great job of connecting the complexities or relationships, appreciation and communication. I hope this film receives the recognition it deserves...because it deserves the recognition.",Malcolm & Marie

441,marinasrashvili,Could have been better,7,5 February 2021,Cinematography and some of the scenes are really good. It makes Malcolm&Marie worth watching. But plot and dialogue.. not so much. It could be so much better.,Malcolm & Marie
442,belizerdem,"Definitely a great movie, much more deeper than everyone think it is",10,4 November 2021,"The only thing i did not like about this movie is the ending argument. Because, throughout the movie i think the superiority between Malcolm and Marie kept changing in every monologue I thought like ""yeah now he won"" oh no ""now she has won the argument"". Therefore I thought the ending monologue will belong to the one who was more right but just before the ending Marie came back to the beginning and said that he did not thank him again and that did not impress me at all. I think, they have had already solved that issue and they dived more deeper in every conversation and I just did not feel like coming back to the surface was the greatest way to finish the film. I expected something like an explosion point for both or one of them, i think it would have been interesting but besides of this the whole movie was very beautiful and the fact that it was shot during lockdown makes it much more valuable because i believe the art that is being made during these kind of situations has a more interesting and different feel to it. Also, I think the movie that they were talking about was the movie itself and the B&W shot is just a perfect choice because it makes the viewer thinking less about the actors being black or white and finally the whole cinematography was beautiful. After watching this movie my perspective to men and women relationship changed in a positive way because they portrayed such a strong couple that almost overcame every obstacle they encountered on the way of getting more and more intimate and I think Malcolm and Maries love for each other is something extraordinary. I would really want to experience such a intimate relationship.",Malcolm & Marie

444,sebastiandevos,"Great performances, but fails to hold attention for rest of film",6,4 February 2021,"The film is 1hr 45 mins.I really like the first 45 minutes. It was funny, well written and well acted and for the most part I was hooked. The black and white looked slick - the cinematography and direction were all really good.However after this there's a 15 minute period where it kinda dips in energy and I started to notice myself checking the time a couple of times.The biggest problem however, comes in the final 45 minutes... because they literally just... repeat the first hour. It follows the same format, arguing back and forth and gets stale way too quickly than it should. It falls into the trap that other contained films do, one where they just kind of run out steam and energy and just ideas of where and how to progress the story forwards. So the end up repeating the same stuff and it becomes, unfortunately, extremely boring.Zendaya and John David Washington are both good but don't make this film worth watching. At least 30 minutes could have been cut and it would've been a lot better, but it wouldn't have solved all the issues.Quite disappointing. Could've been a lot better.",Malcolm & Marie
445,hollynewton,"A thought watch, but you can't seem to turn away",7,9 February 2021,"This was like watching a dramatisation of everything you hate about yourself and other people. A tough watch, but you can't seem to turn away. Their stubbornness, sense of self importance and desperate cries for attention make you cringe because you see yourself and some of the conversations you've had in them. This is both a good thing and a bad thing: the movie is clearly real, but real is definitely not always enjoyable to watch.",Malcolm & Marie
446,raoufaa,A movie that contains deep meanings,8,22 February 2021,"The movie contains many wonderful details that some may see as just a repeat ... For me, I enjoyed very much the most wonderful representation, especially from the side of zendaya...It is wonderful to see such creativity with only two actor throughout the movie.",Malcolm & Marie
447,jakobledwards,Amazing,8,5 February 2021,"This film will definitely not be for everybody, but if you're a fan of raw acting and a certain realism in films that can only be compared to every day life then this is definitely one to watch.",Malcolm & Marie
448,eclec-28760,"Good, but annoying",6,13 March 2021,"This is good, and annoying. The acting is great. It's impressive to see both of the actors bounce from intense to watching how they manage to use just the right words to cut each other. These are two highly intelligent people who know how to push each other's buttons. And while you always want to pick a side, part of the triumph of this movie, is that it's hard for the viewer to do. One of the partners near the end rather triumphs in making their point, but still you get the right and wrong from both of them. Kind of like any relationship. It's real; although, I'm not sure that most of us fight with quite the level of intellectualism of these two, but an hour and a half of bickering can't help but to be annoying.",Malcolm & Marie
449,javah-88013,My time is more valuable...,4,6 February 2021,"I feel like I wasted valuable time watching this movie. It did nothing for me. JDW was all over the place in this movie. Sometimes it even came off as he was rambling. Zendaya tried to hold her own but there was no chemistry between her and JDW. I don't know what the movie was trying to accomplish by doing it such a short time and by filming it during the high of the pandemic. You will have more questions of why after watching this movie.
If your a person that hates to argue ...you will hate this movie. It will be cringing to watch. FYI",Malcolm & Marie

452,glentivlashi,What goes around comes around.,4,18 February 2021,"The actors and acting are good, the thing is when the writer was doing his job, maybe he ""accidentally"" wrote the same thing over and over again.
They come home, smoke, fight. Then they get turned on, cuddle, fight again, they listen to music, smoke and fight again and again, for a ""thank you"" he didn't say. Anyways the plot was kind of cute.The end though. How was the relationship between them at the end? Just staring in a black view and standing, while still being in a damn conflict.Some people might like this movie, but watching almost two hours of a debate, cuddling, smoking and listening to music over and over again, is kind of stressful and tiring at the same time.",Malcolm & Marie
