0,TheLittleSongbird,Well I thought it was entertaining,8,3 September 2010,"While a little too long and a little too simplistic in the storytelling, there is a lot that makes Conan the Barbarian entertaining. It looks fabulous, with beautiful scenery, sets, costumes and cinematography, while the score is brilliant particularly in the first fifteen minutes. The dialogue is pretty good as is the direction, while the action sequences are top notch and the special effects decent. The pacing is brisk enough, while the acting I had little problem with. Arnold Schawarznegger is great as Conan, while James Earl Jones has fun as Thulsa Doom and Max Von Sydow is good value as King Osric. All in all, while no masterpiece Conan the Barbarian is very entertaining and worth watching at least once. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Conan the Barbarian
1,Leofwine_draca,Trend-setting sword and sorcery epic,9,14 May 2016,"This is it - the big one. The film which spawned twenty or thirty imitations across the world in the following years. The film which gave the fantasy adventure - dormant since the Italians packed in doing their sword and sandal flicks in the mid sixties - new life and a brief resurgence in popularity. Of course, it disappeared as soon as it came, the craze died down and the majority of the films were forgotten, except for cult movie fans to uncover them every now and then and marvel at their ""wonders"". There were American imitations - CONAN THE DESTROYER (the sequel in which things degenerated into kiddie level), DRAGONSLAYER; British imitations - HAWK THE SLAYER - and most of all, Italian imitations - THOR THE CONQUEROR, HERCULES, ATOR THE FIGHTING EAGLE to name but a few. Few if any of these films capture the same epic beauty as CONAN THE BARBARIAN, which has the benefit of being an intelligent film (scripted by Oliver Stone with a philosophy behind it) instead of the usual dumb fun.The first thing you notice about this film is the crisp, colourful and breathtaking scenes of deserts, plains, mountains, swamp lands and ancient cities. These were brought to life in the widescreen version I watched and really served to make the film feel real and the world in which it is set an existing place. The wonderful musical score from Basil Poledouris also helps greatly in setting the scene and giving this movie a majestic feel. However, there are a few serious flaws which one has to consider when reviewing this film. Firstly the plot - sometimes it's muddled, sometimes it makes no sense and sometimes it seems to go nowhere. Secondly, the dialogue - especially Arnold's minimal words - is somewhat overstated and ripe, and often unintentionally amusing.The cast, though, is an interesting one. Leading is that man-mountain, Schwarzenegger, in what was his breakthrough role. Although his acting is limited, I do think he was in the right place at the right time when this was made, and the role, which requires him to look strong and fight hard, is tailor-made for his physique and physical skills. If you're not convinced, remember that he did all of his own stunts as they couldn't find a stunt double the same size as him. Schwarzenegger seems to get better as the running time goes on, his journey in the movie paralleling his on-screen transformation from bemused non-actor at the outset to iconic hero and future star at the end.Schwarzenegger is supported by the fiery but unmemorable Sandahl Bergman, who would go on to take the leading role in SHE, another bizarre adventure from Italy. Again, Bergman's acting is limited but she's fine in the action scenes. Lopez is good as the Mongol friend, while Mako is suitably weird and makes a wonderful impression as the bald-headed wizard who aids our hero's quest. However, acting honours go to James Earl Jones, who is actually one of the most frightening screen villains in a long time. He achieves much of his screen power simply through his hypnotic eyes and impassive face, and of course that voice which made Darth Vader famous. Look hard and you'll see Max Von Sydow in a small cameo too, as a forlorn king.From the impressive opening scene - which gives that of GLADIATOR a run for its money - you know that this film is going to be brutal, with the eating of Conan's dad by dogs and the decapitation of his mum. The high violence level is another thing I like about this film, as that and the frequent sex and nudity help to convey life in a cruder, less sophisticated world. Action scenes in which arterial blood sprays everywhere and people's heads are cut off are some of the most visually impressive I've ever seen and enjoyed. And occasionally, John Milius manages to transcend the film's pulp origins. The rescue scene is absolutely sublime thanks to the suspenseful music (thanks to Basil Poledouris for the great score) and the editing.The special effects are primitive but effective, and in particular I like the massive snake which briefly attacks Arnie in an underground cavern. Another good scene is where animated demons appear to try and take a dying Arnie away and must be batted off by his friends. The transformation of James Earl Jones into a snake is also very creepy and well done. This is a film packed with memorable genre scenes; from the opening montage which charts Conan's progression from a slave to a gladiator to a free man, to the superb ending which seems him finally get his revenge, there are many good bits to watch. These include the robbery of the snake eye crystal from a temple, Conan's entry into an underground tomb of an ancient king and the battle among the standing stones on the desert plain. Highly enjoyable and only mildly flawed, CONAN THE BARBARIAN is a film everybody should see at least once.",Conan the Barbarian
2,SnoopyStyle,perfect role for Arnold,8,1 August 2015,"As a boy, Conan is taught by his father to admire the power of steel. His village is destroyed by marauders led by Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). Thulsa kills his mother right in front of him. He and the other children are enslaved and sold. Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) grows up to be a gladiator. He is taught battle skills and the art of war. He escapes and finds a sword in a king's tomb. He saves thief Subotai (Gerry Lopez). In a city, they follow the snake symbol to a serpent tower where they join fellow thief Valeria (Sandahl Bergman). They kill the giant snake and steal the jewels. King Osric (Max Von Sydow) recruits the three thieves to rescue his daughter who had fallen under the spell of cult leader Thulsa. Conan goes off on his own and meets Wizard (Mako) on the way.This is the perfect role for Arnold. He's not asked to do too much acting. His persona fits this character perfectly. The only drawback is the lack of better actors in some of the other roles. It also lacks humor to lighten the mood although it works quite well taking the material exceedingly seriously. It accepts the material on its face value.",Conan the Barbarian
3,gavin6942,A Classic of its Genre,8,11 December 2015,"a film about a young barbarian's quest to avenge his parents' deaths. The story is set in the fictional Hyborian Age, thousands of years before the rise of modern civilization. The film opens with the title card, ""That which does not kill us makes us stronger"", a paraphrasing of Friedrich Nietzsche, followed by a voice-over that establishes the film as the story of Conan's origin.I love the use of Genghis Khan's speech: ""The greatest pleasure is to vanquish your enemies, to chase them before you, to rob them of their wealth, to see those dear to them bathed in tears, to ride their horses, to clasp to your bosom their wives and daughters."" I mean, you know, it's sexist and horribly crude, but perfect for the world of barbarians.For all its faults, this is a true staple of the fantasy genre. It can be denounced as overly violent (true) and feeding into male prepubescent fantasy (true), but look at the source material: early 20th century pulp. This is exactly what it is supposed to be.",Conan the Barbarian
4,jboothmillard,Conan the Barbarian,3,15 July 2008,"Before The Terminator, the film that turned him into a superstar, the former bodybuilder from Austria made this little sword-and-sorcery epic, and unfortunately, it wasn't as good as I'd expected. Basically the parents of young Conan are murdered by Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), and he is enslaved. He grows up, and now Conan (Razzie nominated Arnold Schwarzenegger) is becoming a mighty warrior and being trained as a fighter. Eventually after being a Gladiator, he is set free, and now on a quest, he vows to avenge his parents, and solve the riddle of steel (?). Joined by Subotai (Gerry Lopez), beautiful thief who falls in love with him, Valeria (introducing Golden Globe winning Sandahl Bergman), and the Chinese Wizard (Mako, also narrating), they set out to rescue the Princess (Valérie Quennessen), daughter of King Osric (Max Von Sydow), oh, and Conan can get revenge on Thulsa Doom. Also starring Ben Davidson as Rexor, Cassandra Gaviola as The Witch, William Smith as Conan's Father and Luis Barboo as Red Hair. Like in The Terminator, Schwarzenegger doesn't have the biggest amount of dialogue, I can see what the critics mean about the film looking fabulous, I assume they mean costumes and scenery, but besides this and seeing an early leading role for Arnie, this is pointless film. The continuing sequel, Conan the Destroyer, followed two years later. Arnold Schwarzenegger was number 54 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Adequate!",Conan the Barbarian
5,Woodyanders,"A supremely tough, gritty and exciting sword and sorcery fantasy action winner",8,13 January 2008,"Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger in the tailor-made role that launched his career) vows to get revenge on evil cult leader Thulsa Doom (a grandly wicked James Earl Jones), who killed both of Conan's parents and everyone in his village. Conan is assisted by the brave Valerie, Queen of Thieves (a fine performance by the exquisitely graceful and gorgeous Sandahl Bergman), loyal thief/archer Subotia the Mongol (an extremely likable turn by champion surfer Gerry Lopez), and a batty, but wise wizard (the excellent Mako). Director John Milius, who also co-wrote the smart and gutsy script with Oliver Stone, does a masterful job of creating a hard, serious, rough-edged tone, maintains a steady pace throughout, and stages the action scenes with considerable rip-snorting brio. The sterling cast qualifies as a significant asset: Max von Sydow hams it up deliciously as the drunken King Osric, William Smith makes a strong impression as Conan's father, Valerie Quennessen is absolutely ravishing as a fair princess who falls under Thulsa Doom's spell, Cassandra Gaviola has a memorably sexy bit as a lovely, yet lethal witch, brawny behemoths Ben Davidson and Sven-Ole Thorsen serve as perfect foils for Conan as two of Thulsa Doom's nasty henchmen, and Jess Franco film regular Jack Taylor even pops up in a small part as a priest. Kudos are also in order for the wonderfully robust, stirring and flat-out beautiful full-bore orchestral score by Basil Poledouis. Duke Callaghan's stunning widescreen cinematography and Ron Cobb's striking production design add immensely to the overall breathtaking epic scope and majestic sweep of this hugely enjoyable rough'n'tumble fantasy action treat.",Conan the Barbarian
6,ma-cortes,Overwhelming sword-and-witchery epic in one of the first and main roles for Arnold Schwarzenegger,7,14 March 2011,"Sword-and-sorcery epic with incredible adventures , spectacular battles and strong scenes . This is an epic adventure set in Hyborian Age based on Robert E. Howard's pulp tales with screenplay by Oliver Stone and the same director John Milius . It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role, as the Hyborian Age hero fighting against ominous and heinous nasties . Conan seeks vengeance when being kid (Jorge Sanz) he saw as his mother (Nadiuska) was decapitated by a sorcerer (James Earl Jones), subsequently his village was slaughtered and he enslaved . Many years later , Conan undertakes a perilous travel with the help his partner (Gerry Lopez), a magician (Mako, who repeats his role as wizard in the sequel ¨Conan the destroyer ¨ by Richard Fleischer), a gorgeous warrior (Sandhal Bergman) who is also sidekick and lover , all of them are assigned by a king (Max Von Sidow) to free a young princess (Valerie Quennessen) from the claws a satanic witch . They undergo on a risked trip to find the princess , contending the cult leader and his giant hoodlum (Ben Davidson) and leading a vibrant ending.This violent sword-and-witchery story packs noisy action, blood-thirsty battles at every turn , full-blooded adventure, thrills, crude scenes and rip-roaring fights. The picture is unbelievably brutal and sexist though also displays some love scenes and raunchy images . Made on a grand scale , approx 20 million of dollars , with spectacular production design by Ron Cobb and colorful cinematography by Duke Callaham , mostly filmed in Almeria (Spain) where in the 60s and 70s were shot innumerable Spaghetti Western . Big budget and lavishly produced by the great producer Dino and Rafaella De Laurentis, Dino's daughter. Impressive and groundbreaking musical score composed and conducted by Basil Poledouris . Conan fans will be delighted with this breathtaking and bloody epic . Followed by a sequel titled ¨Conan the destroyer¨ with Wilt Chamberlain , Grace Jones , Sarah Douglas and Olivia D'Abo that contains some dumb images and is unintentionally hilarious but amusing ; furthermore several low-grade imitations and rip offs, and spawned TV series starred by Ralph Moller. Plus a similar film realized in old-fashioned and lightweight style also directed by Richard Fleischer titled ¨Red Sonja¨ with Brigette Nielsen as female lead , Sandahl Bergman and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger has a brief guest spot. And in production a new ¨Conan¨ by Marcus Nispel with Jason Momoa, Rose McGowan and Ron Perlman",Conan the Barbarian
7,BA_Harrison,The role Arnie was born to play.,8,28 February 2015,"Directed by John Milius, this hugely entertaining slice of sword and sorcery is epic stuff from start to finish, opening with Conan as a young boy witnessing the slaughter of his tribe by the evil snake-cult leader Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) and his henchmen, charting Conan's subsequent life as a slave, a gladiator, and a thief, and following him as he and his loyal friend Subotai (Gerry Lopez) and sexy squeeze Valeria (Sandahl Bergman) travel to Thulsa Doom's mountain lair to rescue a king's daughter and exact a little revenge.As an actor, five times Mr. Universe and seven times Mr. Olympia Arnold Schwarzenegger might only be slightly less wooden than The Tree of Woe to which he is nailed, but with more muscle mass in one arm than the average man has in his entire body, he makes a perfect Conan the Barbarian. As expected, Arnold mauls his dialogue like he's chewing on a vulture's neck, but he gives the role everything he's got, especially when it comes to swinging a sword and slicing up men like they're so much Extrawurst. Arnie flexes his muscles, blood and limbs fly in all directions, and Hollywood's greatest action star is born.Milius's film might threaten to become mired by a sense of self importance at times, but with bags of atmosphere, superb production design by Ron Cobb, and stunning cinematography, plus oodles of brutal hacking and slashing, all accompanied by a breath-taking symphonic score by Basil Poledouris, Arnie's first major movie ultimately emerges triumphant.",Conan the Barbarian
8,BandSAboutMovies,A perfect film,10,28 January 2019,"When Robert E. Howard created Conan, it was popular for its time as a pulp character. By the time of his creator's suicide in 1936, Conan had appeared in 21 complete stories, 17 of which had been published, as well as a number of unfinished tales. After years of the copyright to the character passing around, Lancer released a series of paperbacks with dynamic Frank Frazetta covers that introduced the Cimmerian barbarian to an entirely new audience.In 1970, Marvel Comics began adapting the Howard tales, arguably increasing the reach of the character even further than the original books. Then, in 1975, Edward R. Pressman (who also produced Christmas Evil) and Edward Summer started working on getting the books onto the silver screen. They had Oliver Stone writing it and Arnold Schwarzenegger for the lead, but couldn't get major studios interested.However, in 1979, they sold the project to Dino De Laurentiis and John Milius picked as the director. Combining several Howard stories, the filming took place in Spain and the entire film was based on Frazetta's artwork. After a year of editing - and plenty of gore being cut out - the film was released to $100 million dollars of box office, which increased thanks to home video and cable. Some don't consider it a blockbuster, but how else would there so many ripoffs released in its wake?The film begins with a sword being forged by a blacksmith who shows it to his son, the young Conan, and tells him the Riddle of Steel. To sum it up, ""Flesh grows weak. Steel becomes brittle. But the will is indomitable"". He tells his son that everyone will fail him, but he can always count on steel.The Cimmerians are soon murdered by a band of warriors led by Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). This villain is a combination of several Howard characters. While his name comes from one of Kull of Atlantis' villains, he is similar to Thoth-Amon, leading an army of suicidal warriors devoted to their king.Conan's father is killed by dogs and his sword is given to Doom, who hypnotizes and then beheads Conan's mom (Nadiuska, who was also in Guyana: Cult of the Damned) in front of him. Our hero is then sold into slavery, chained to a mill stone known as the Wheel of Pain. While other children die, Conan lives to become a monster of a man, consigned to the gladiator pits and used as a stud to create more soldiers. Yet Conan becomes a favorite of the men he has been sold to and is educated in the East before being freed.Conan wanders the world as a free man, finding an ancient sword and meeting a witch who gives him a prophecy of his future. This scene kinda blows my mind, because Conan is so good at having sex that he turns the witch into a demon and then throws her into the fire. That's how good Conan is in the sack.Conan befriends Subotai (surfing legend Gerry Lopez), a Hyrkanian thief, and Valeria, a female mercenary. Her name comes from Conan's companion in the story ""Red Nails"", while her personality and fate are based on Belit, the pirate queen of ""Queen of the Black Coast."" She's played by Sandahl Bergman, who is also in She, a totally ridiculous movie that I want more people to love as much as me.In the city of Zamora, the trio steal from the Tower of Serpents and Valeria and Conan seal their union by making love. Soon, they're captured by the soldiers of King Osric (Max von Sydow), who only ask that three bring back his daughter. Subotai and Valeria refuse, but Conan's hatred of Doom sends him to the Temple of Set.There, he's captured and tortured, as Doom insults his family and crucifies him on the Tree of Woe. Before our hero dies, Subotai rescues him and brings him to Akiro, the Wizard of the Mounds. He's played by Mako, who was also the voice of Master Splinter in 2007's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The wizard summons demons that heal our hero but extract a heavy toll that Valeria agrees to pay.Finally, our heroes go back to Doom's temple and unleash their full vengeance. However, Doom himself becomes a giant snake and slithers away, because this movie is both insane and awesome. As the trio rides away, Doom shoots Valeria with a snake arrow and she dies in Conan's arms, paying the toll that the wizard warned her about.She is burned at the Mounds. As Conan stares at the fire, having lost the love of his life, Subotai cries for his friend, explaining that ""a Cimmerian won't cry, so I cry for him."" How is a film sotestosteronee and gore filled so poetic at times?Our hero lays waste to Doom's troops and when Rexor (former Oakland Raider Ben Davidson, who also played the bouncer in Behind the Green Door), one of the largest of them, almost kills him Valeria reappears as a valkyrie to save him for the briefest of seconds. Subotai saves the princess and Conan finds his father's sword and breaks it in combat. Look for Sven Ole Thorsen in this too as Thorgrim. Sven has dated Grace Jones since 1990, but has been in an open relationship with her since 2007. He's also in Conan the Destroyer and The Running Man.That night, Conan comes back to the Temple and is greeted with open arms by Doom, who tries to mentally stop him. Conan resists and beheads his enemy with his father's broken sword. He has solved the Riddle of Steel: you must become the steel and only rely upon yourself.Conan burns down the Temple of Set and returns the princess to her father. The movie then shows us Conan on the throne of an empire, letting us know that one day he will rule the entire land.No one could play Conan but Arnold, who started growing his hair in 1979 for this part. He trained for this movie like he did for his bodybuilding competitions: weapons training, martial arts training, horse riding lessons, even sword fighting with an 11-pound broadsword two hours a day for three months, as well as how to fall and roll from 15-foot drops. He also got five percent of the movie's profits, a pretty hefty sum.I love this movie. I adore the fact that Conan doesn't speak until 20 minutes into the film and doesn't speak for the last 20 minutes either. It's awesome that Valeria is just as strong of a fighter - and maybe even stronger in spirit - as Conan. Every 80's sword and sorcery movie is in debt to this, as much as Arnold claims that his performance is owed to peblum star Steve Reeves.",Conan the Barbarian

10,Hey_Sweden,"...And if you do not listen, then the Hell with you!",9,12 September 2017,"Robert E. Howards' pulp hero got envisioned for the big screen in a majestic way, with this initial starring vehicle for champion weightlifter and future action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger. Its extremely impressive production values, and vivid storytelling, make it absolutely tops for its genre, and indeed superior to many of the imitative sword and sorcery epics that it spawned. Conan is orphaned as a boy when evil cult leader Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) and his minions slaughter the people of Conans' village, including Conans' parents (played by Nadiuska and the legendary movie tough guy William Smith). The film charts Conans' odyssey from young slave to pit fighter to thief to avenging hero, giving him some faithful companions in the form of Valeria (Sandahl Bergman), Subotai (surfer Gerry Lopez), and the Wizard (Mako, who also serves as narrator).With a screenplay credited to director John Milius and Oliver Stone, ""Conan the Barbarian"" is grand in its scope. Excellent location shooting (entirely in Spain) helps a great deal in creating the atmosphere, along with eye popping production design by Ron Cobb and cinematography by Duke Callaghan. Unlike some of its imitators, ""Conan the Barbarian"" is definitely a fantasy feature for adults, with a fair amount of female skin bared and some effectively nasty violence. Milius keeps optical effects to a minimum, and employs some enjoyable practically done effects along the way. The action scenes are nicely executed. But soaring above a lot of the other assets is the grandiose score composed by Basil Poledouris. It is simply perfect for the material.Arnold is of course an ideal choice for the title role. His physical prowess, and physique, are on full display. The supporting cast is also up to the task. Jones is a wonderfully odious, yet charismatic, villain. Bergman is not much of an actress, but she too shows off an effective athleticism. Lopez (who is actually dubbed by actor Sab Shimono) is engaging, and Mako a hoot as he so often was. Smith is seen much too briefly, but Max von Sydow makes the most of his limited screen time, relishing a rare opportunity to ham it up. Arnolds' weightlifting associates Franco Columbu & Sven-Ole Thorsen, and football player Ben Davidson, play assorted heavies. Cassandra Gava makes a memorable appearance as a witch. Expatriate actor Jack Taylor, a familiar face to fans of European horror and exploitation, has a cameo as a priest.If one is looking to delve into this genre, they simply can't do better than this.Nine out of 10.",Conan the Barbarian
11,poolandrews,"""Contemplate this on the tree of woe."" Didn't do much for me.",5,15 July 2008,"Conan the Barbarian starts as evil ruler of a Snake cult named Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) & his men ride into a small village & brutally kill most of the people who live there & sell the other's into slavery including a young boy named Conan (Jorge Sanz). Jump forward several years & Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is now a man, a very strong man who quickly shines as a gladiatorial fighter. Conan is taught sword fighting skills & is educated until he escapes & meets up with a female thief named Valeria (Sandahl Bergman) & an archer named Subotai (Gerry Lopez), they alone dare to stand up to the cult of the Snake which is engulfing the entire world. Out for both vengeance & profit the three allies must do battle against an entire army if they are to succeed in their quest...Co-written & directed by John Milius this was the first time that the character of Conan the Barbarian had appeared in a film, created by author Robert Howard during the 30's Conan appeared in various stories & novels & indeed eventually films such as this which I have to say I thought was pretty average & don't really see where all the love for it comes from. There are a few different versions of Conan the Barbarian in circulation at the moment, the short US released version, a longer European cut & a third even longer more complete cut & I will be basing my comments on the international European cut. The script by Milius & Oliver Stone of all people is actually fairly slow going for the first half & it's also rather ponderous & bitty. There are lots of annoying fade dissolves from one scene & one location to another as Conan grows up, becomes a champion fighter, gets educated, wanders around a lot & then meets up with with Valeria & Subotai as a large chunk of time passes with very little dialogue, apart from the narrator virtually none in fact, & the film never stayed in one place long enough for me to get involved with what was going on. The film is obviously very pro war & there's a lot of sentiment in it's battle scenes as it portrays warriors & fighters as the real hero's. Towards the end when Conan gets to fight the evil Snake cult then the film picks up & becomes watchable but even then I felt very detached from it because the lack of dialogue, the lack of character's & a story that seemed quite random. The fantasy elements of the film were a disappointment, in Howards original stories the character of Conan fought all sorts of monsters, creatures & demons while here the fantasy elements are a bit random like Thulsa Doom turning into a Snake for no reason, the daft scene in which spirits try to take Conan away & a giant Snake which Conan kills. I wasn't impressed with what little dialogue there is either, all the old style talk just got silly & it's hard to relate to it & is it just me or does anyone else find names like Valeria, Subotai, Thulsa, Osric, Rexor & Thorgrim silly & just impossible to keep track of who is who?The film looks quite nice & again try to watch it in it's original 2:35:1 widescreen ratio as so much is lost on pan and scan editions. This is actually pretty violent at times with lots of blood, a couple of gory decapitations, sword fights, impalings, slashed throats & the like. The special effects are alright, the giant snake looks alright although the scenes where Thulsa Doom 'straightens' out a live Snake & then uses it as an arrow shot from his bow do look a bit silly & like they belong in a cartoon. The whole medieval look of Conan the Barbarian is well realised with nicely detailed sets, costumes & production design. Imagine Lord of the Rings if you will without any CGI computer effects work & your probably not too far off what Conan the Barbarian looks like.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 this is well made with good production values, filmed in Spain & Canada. Conan the Barbarian is credited as the film that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a star, to be honest I think he's absolutely terrible in this & is so wooden it's untrue, also what on Earth is going on with his hair? James Earl Jones gets second billing in the credits for less than ten minutes of screen time while third billed Max von Sydow has less than five minutes screen time.Conan the Barbarian is a fairly slow moving & for me an average sword & sorcery fantasy adventure film without nowhere near enough fantasy or adventure for my liking at all, it's not a terrible film & it's alright to watch once but I can't say I have that many positive feelings about it. Followed by Conan the Destroyer (1984) & two Conan themed TV show's Conan: The Adventurer (1992) & Conan (1992) while a new Conan film simply called Conan (2009) is in production as I write this.",Conan the Barbarian
12,Bunuel1976,"CONAN THE BARBARIAN {Extended International Version} (John Milius, 1982) ***",7,12 January 2008,"I still have vivid memories of watching this one on Italian TV, with several of its images (alternately sexual, violent and scary) remaining memorable to this very day - particularly the sequence in the giant snake's lair and the shooting of snakes as arrows!; I also recall catching some of its lowbrow imitators like the Italian-made ATOR movies and THE BEASTMASTER (1982) on TV or VHS, not to mention playing the ""Barbarian"" computer game with its theme and music clearly inspired by this movie. As a matter of fact, the awe-inspiring visuals and Basil Poledouris' now-classic score still constitute the film's mainstays, smoothing over a rather wooly plot and the inherently ponderous nature of the whole enterprise – since what humor there is throughout is quickly stifled by its overpowering sense of gloom. This third viewing of the film – via the Extended (but also slightly censored) version on R4 SE DVD proved to be the most satisfactory so far; I guess it helped that it followed on the heels of several similar ""sword-and-sorcery"" outings which enabled the inherent superiority of CONAN THE BARBARIAN to fully emerge.Arnold Schwarzenegger is the perfect embodiment of a brawny medieval action hero; Sandahl Bergman (who would eventually turn villainous for RED SONJA [1985]) is equally impressive as Valeria, Conan's blonde female counterpart – their rapport is genuine enough as to make his being shown still pining for her throughout CONAN THE DESTROYER (1984) credible, the villainess of that film (Sarah Douglas) having promised to resurrect Valeria if he lends his services to her 'cause'!; also on the side of good are Mako as Akiro The Wizard (who returns in the sequel and actually provides the narration in both Conan ventures) and surfer Gerry Lopez as a Mongol thief.Incidentally, the project originated with Oliver Stone – who's still credited as co-writer: incongruously for him, he had stressed the fantasy elements of the tale (which writer/director Milius subsequently de-emphasized after taking over); perhaps to lend the film some artistic gravitas, the latter selected powerful and well-known actors for some of the leading characters: James Earl Jones makes for a very sinister Thulsa Doom (playing the last surviving member of an ancient cannibal civilization, he's made to turn into a giant snake!) and Max Von Sydow (as a king given the Shakespearean name of Osric, even if only one of the sequences filmed with him made the final cut!); a surprising, albeit all-too-brief, presence in the film is that of Jess Franco regular Jack Taylor – here playing one of the priests at Jones' temple.In the accompanying documentary (see below), Milius admits to being influenced by Masaki Kobayashi's classic ghost story compendium KWAIDAN (1964): this can be seen in the love-making scene with a woman turning into a witch (complete with similar use of blue gels) and the protection of an ailing Conan from evil spirits by having several chants written all over his body. Also in the documentary, there is a reference to Milius' amusing cameo which eventually found itself on the cutting-room floor!",Conan the Barbarian

Together with a wizard (Mako), a thief named Valeria (Sandahl Bergman), and an archer named Subotai (Gerry Lopez), Conan takes on Thulsa Doom to rescue a princess and get his revenge. A great sword & sorcery movie. The pinnacle of that subgenre of fantasy. Directed with flourish by John Milius, with a wonderful script by Milius and Oliver Stone (!). Fantastic score by Basil Poledouris. Schwarzenegger is great in a role that plays to his limited strengths as an actor. Obviously he is not a favorite amongst film snobs. But those of us who see the merits of good action movies appreciate him. James Earl Jones is memorably creepy as Thulsa Doom. Bergman is surprisingly good as Valeria. Mako nearly steals the movie.

15,zardoz-13,A Sword & Sorcery Classic,10,25 November 2019,"Writer & director John Milius' ""Conan the Barbarian"" qualifies as a classic sword and sorcery saga of epic proportions. As the eponymous protagonist, Arnold Schwarzenegger wields the sword with gusto. As the antagonist Thulsa Doom, James Earl Jones practices the sorcery as a tyrant who can shape-shift from a man to a snake. Sprawling, larger-than-life, and set against scenic Spanish locations, ""Conan"" is a spectacle that redefines the genre. Everything you might want from a sword and sorcery movie is contained in this R-rated, 129-minute extravaganza that cost $16 million and reaped a box office bonanza to the count of $130-million! Basil Poledouris's magnificent orchestral soundtrack bolsters this high adventure and lends majesty to its shenanigans. Of course, everybody who loves Conan loves the scene on the Tree of Woe where our hero is crucified. No less important is the Wheel of Pain that transforms a lowly village adolescent into the muscle-bound protagonist. Indeed, this exercise in machismo distinguishes itself in so many categories. Milius leaves no stone unearthed. Finally, the villainous voice of Darth Vader takes on a physical presence with James Earl Jones' performance. ""Conan"" has aged well. The special effects, particularly Thulsa Doom's transformation into a giant snake is well done. Sandahl Bergman is no damsel-in-distress as one of Conan's accomplices in crime and revenge. William Smith is cast as Conan's father who lectures him about the trustworthy nature of steel. Altogether, this robust original will leave you wanting more.",Conan the Barbarian

When he grows up he becomes a fearless, invincible fighter. Set free, he plots revenge against Thulsa Doom.Good fun. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, so you know this isn't going to be Citizen Kane, but ithe movie has a rawness, charm and energy to it that is very engaging. Plot is fairly basic but is always interesting and never takes itself too seriously.Schwarzenegger does what he does best - be a muscle-bound action hero, killing bad guys - and does so very well. He even has some good one-liners too.A good old-fashioned sword-and-sorcery romp.",Conan the Barbarian
17,Boba_Fett1138,Cult classic!,8,20 September 2008,"This movie might very well be THE ultimate cult classic ever made. It certainly is my favorite. Never have I seen a movie with so much and such great cult value in it.It's not really an epic movie in terms of having large epic sequences and battles in it but it nevertheless is a movie that takes on some epic proportions, which of course is also not in the least due to Arnold Schwarzenegger epic appearance in this movie. He was in great shape for this movie and it actually was also on of his earlier movie roles. It definitely was the movie that launched him to stardom. Not that his acting is epic in this movie though. It actually quite honestly is laughable bad at times but this only really adds to the movie its cult value.But what really makes this movie epic to me is its musical score by Basil Poledouris. Throughout his career Poledouris has scored for quite an amount of potentially B-movies (basicly all the scores he did for the John Milius and Paul Verhoeven movies) but his scores always managed to uplifts the movie to a much higher level, making these movies always much more than just a standard B-movie. I really can't imaging how this movie would had been without his musical score. As a matter of fact I don't even think I would had ever watched this movie, had it not been for its music.With its $20,000,000 budget this was a fairly expenses genre production for its time, also especially when you compare the budget to John Milius' previous projects. It's budget can be seen back in its nicely shot action sequences, it's production values with its settings (it was mostly shot in Spain), costumes and sets. It makes this visual a nice movie to watch. It wasn't a big box office success though and the movie did not became popular until years later, when the movie reached it cult-status.The story isn't really much special though and it also sort of drags in its middle part, when the movie does not always succeeds at it to bring entertainment. The movie is at its best when it is not trying to be more than it in fact is. The story just does not allow it to make this movie a great perfect classic. When the movie tries to be more serious this becomes painfully too obvious. It's mostly an enjoyable movie when its action kicks in. Luckily the movie is filled with some good old fashioned swords and fist fights, mostly in the beginning and toward the end of the movie. It can be a pretty violent movie at times and it also features its fair share of blood and gore.Besides Arnold Schwarzenegger the movie also features James Earl Jones in a rare villainous role. I don't think that there at that many movies around in which James Earl Jones plays a villain, except of course from the Star Wars movies, in which he voiced the ultimate villain Darth Vader. It also has Max von Sydow in a real small role and Japanese born actor Mako in a role which made him known and popular, despite the fact that he already had received an Oscar nomination once, 2 decades prior to this movie. It aren't really the actors that make this movie a good watch though but more the characters which they portray.My number one cult favorite!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Conan the Barbarian
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Very entertaining, and thoroughly well-done",7,9 March 2008,"Arnie in the lead role. James Earl Jones as the villain. Clear effort and care, that shows, in every department. Really, what more could you ask of this film? I have not read any of Howard's stories, so all I know about Conan is how many times the character has been done, and of course what this film told me. Be forewarned, there is some sexuality(not many places, but when it's there, it can be strong), a lot of violence, and a seemingly endless stream of death throughout this, and you should only watch this if you are prepared for(and able to tolerate) such. The plot is quite good, and I understand it does incorporate several elements and occurrences from the original stories by Howard(R.I.P.). The pacing is pretty much flawless, I was never bored. The action is well-done, intense and with great choreography. Acting is spot-on, more or less. Jones is a more intimidating presence elsewhere, but he's not bad at all. Schwarzenegger does rather well. Production values are of notably high quality for the entire feature. No expense seems spared. Vast sets and locations, detailed costumes and props, countless extras. Special effects are magnificent, and not just for the time it was made. Sound is reasonable, a lot of lines seem ADR'ed, but the music is masterful. Dialog varies, but most of it is marvelous, both writing and delivery. Cinematography and editing are top-notch. This builds atmosphere skillfully, and the amount of dialog and where it occurs is chosen with care. I would advise against reading the Trivia entries, or at least all of them, before the viewing, as they do give some things away. I recommend this to any fan of the genre, Arnie, and possibly Jones and/or Sydow, as well. 7/10",Conan the Barbarian
19,view_and_review,Barbaric,4,9 September 2018,"Tried as they did to distract me with nude flesh, it still could not cover up the bad script and bad acting of Mr. Schwarzenegger. No, he wasn't the only bad apple but he was the biggest. At times the movie seemed to be going for a Shakespearian delivery which seemed so out of place. One such line was, ""let me breathe my last breath in your mouth,"" a character said as she expired. Ugh, don't make me gag. As a movie for just indulging in sex and violence: Conan the Barbarian would get top marks. As a movie needing a modicum of a good story and decent acting: Conan the Barbarian fails.",Conan the Barbarian
20,Uriah43,An Award Winning Performance by Sandahl Bergman,8,5 October 2017,"After everyone in his village is ruthlessly murdered by a warlord known as ""Thulsa Doom"" (James Earl Jones) a young boy named ""Conan"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is captured and sentenced to hard labor as a slave on a giant treadmill for the rest of his life. However, as the years pass he is essentially forgotten about and subsequently sold into servitude as a gladiator. This new situation agrees with him and he soon becomes the most successful and feared gladiator in the land. Then one day he is freed and with him goes this fierce anger for revenge against Thulsa Doom who slaughtered his people and caused him so much suffering. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film turned out to be surprisingly good due to a number of certain qualities in its favor. It had a good, action-oriented plot and some decent acting on the part of Sandahl Bergman (""Valeria"") who won a Golden Globe Award for ""New Star of the Year"" and a Saturn Award for ""Best Actress"" in the process. Likewise, it was also nominated for several other Saturn Awards to include ""Best Fantasy Film"", ""Best Music"" and ""Best Costumes"" among others. Be that as it may, while this might not be a film for the ages, I still found it to be an extremely enjoyable movie and I have rated it accordingly.",Conan the Barbarian
21,Aaron1375,A role perfect for Arnold.,9,28 February 2003,This like the terminator is a role that is just right for Arnold to play. Here he plays a warrior slave who as a child witnessed his mother killed at the hands of James Earl Jones who is a great bad guy here.  He is raised as a slave and he becomes a fighter slave.  He is one of the best until one day his master frees him.  Once freed he meets allies and enemies alike as a king finally catches him after stealing stuff from this tower that worships snakes.  The king requests Conan and his two friends to go find his daughter being held by James Earl Jones.  At one point Conan is captured and left for dead before they infiltrate the base.  Then near the end of the movie there is one heck of a battle between Jone's men and Conan that is really the highlight of the movie.  One gripe though is that through the whole movie you expect Jone's character and Conan to have an epic battle...the ending is still satisfying even though that doesn't really come about.,Conan the Barbarian
22,Wuchakk,"""Sit here... SIT HERE""",8,13 January 2011,"I was hugely disappointed by ""Conan the Barbarian"" (1982) when I first viewed it because it deviated too far from the blueprint established by creator Robert E. Howard. Yeah, they got many things right, but the things they got wrong ruined the film for me. Yet I've warmed up to it over time because one can't deny the film's merits. If you're a fan of the books and the faithful comics, it's important to realize going in that this is an ALTERNATIVE Conan, similar to Howard's, but far from a strict interpretation.The flaws mostly have to do with John Milius and Oliver Stone's deviation from Howard. Consider the opening sequence of Conan as a little boy on his father's knee getting advice about the trustworthiness of the sword: Sorry, but the lad looks like an average soft suburbanite boy, not a tough kid that grew up in the wilds of Cimmeria, land of darkness and deep night.Secondly, the ""wheel of pain"" sequence is just dumb. I have a bit more respect for this part now that I realize it's a metaphor for the cyclical drudgery of grade school but, c'mon, the REAL Conan wouldn't spend that many years in captivity! He would have escaped long before, not to mention slay his captors. I suppose it helps when consider that Stone & Milius were taking bits from Howard's other creations, like Kull, who was a slave for a few years.Thirdly, when they first meet Valeria while robbing the temple of Set the flick cops a decidedly campy tone. Although Sandahl Bergman is great throughout the rest of the picture that initial meeting is pretty cringe-inducing. It was at this point that I really tuned out when I first viewed the film. Fourthly, one of the worst parts is when Conan grovels at Thulsa Doom's feet crying, ""You killed my father; you killed my mother!"" This in no way resembles Howard's Conan. But, in its defense, it does make Conan more human and therefore more relate-able to the viewer.Thankfully, the film has several strengths, starting with the magnificent and awe-inspiring score by Basil Poledouris. The movie's worth viewing just to hear this score. Secondly, despite acceptable discrepancies (e.g. Conan has black hair not brown), the casting is quite good; although Schwarzenegger doesn't really reflect the air of REH's character (Jason Momoa is far better). Thirdly, Milius & Stone show their brilliance by incorporating Genghis Khan's historical quote in Conan's response to ""What is best in life?"" Conan answers: ""To crush enemies, see dem driven before you and to hear da lamentation of der women.""Fourthly, the locations, sets and costuming are superb. They certainly got the LOOK of Robert E. Howard's Hyborian Age right. Fifthly, As long as one is prepared to accept the deviation from Howard's Conan, the story keeps your interest throughout (which is my way of determining the worthiness of ANY flick). Sixthly, Sandahl Bergman is super sharp and sexy; she possesses a certain barbaric beauty essential to the role and it's hard not to gaze at her shapely form in awe when she's on screen.Lastly, the overall tone of the film is quite serious and brooding. Despite Valeria's initial campy sequence mentioned earlier and a couple of amusing scenes with Mako, the film eludes the rut of camp (unfortunately the 1984 sequel cannot boast of this quality).SPECIAL MOMENTS AND INTERESTING ITEMS:The love scene between Conan & Valeria and, later, the death/funeral pyre scenes are reverent, beautiful and moving. The accompanying piece by Poledouris is emotionally potent.Conan's spiritual evolution in regards to sexuality and love is interesting: His first exposure is as a slave when beautiful women are occasionally thrown to him for the amusement of those watching. After he acquires his freedom his first (and presumably only) experience with casual sex goes horribly wrong. Later in Zamora he dismisses the solicitations of prostitutes with a wave and a derogatory word. Finally he meets Valeria and discovers true love and commitment, conveyed well in the love/death/funeral scenes noted above.Both the battles inside the mountain fortress and, later, the showdown at the mounds are thrilling with the accompanying score getting your blood pumping.Right before the battle at the mounds Conan and Subotai brace themselves as the 'riders of doom' trot forth. You can see the bold determination on their faces: They have no other recourse; they will stand and fight as men, come what may. (All men will eventually have to stand and fight in this manner one way or another, and we wuss out at our own peril).After their unlikely victory Conan raises his arms (and weapons) in salute to the altar where Valeria was cremated. It gives you goosebumps. Both ""The Complete Quest"" and ""Collector's Edition"" contain an excellent 55-minute ""Making Of"" documentary wherein all of the principle actors and creators are interviewed, as well as an excellent commentary by Milius and Schwarzenegger.FINAL ANALYSIS: Like I said, I've finally come to see the magnificence of ""Conan the Barbarian,"" but I had to get over my hang ups concerning the deviations from Howard's Conan to see it. As an ALTERNATIVE Conan it's a nigh masterpiece of cinematic art.One last thing: Um, don't use that first line of dialogue (""Sit here... SIT HERE"") on your wife or girlfriend; I tried it and she didn't take too kindly to it!The film runs 2 hours, 9 minutes, and was shot in Spain.GRADE: A-",Conan the Barbarian

24,Mr-Fusion,The mixed bag that put Schwarzenegger's name on the map,5,16 August 2012,"Possibly the purest sword-and-sorcery epic ever made, ""Conan the Barbarian"" finds the eponymous Schwarzenegger orphaned after his parents are slain by the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). Raised in slavery and honed into a bloodthirsty gladiator, Conan embarks on a journey to avenge his parents; one that will see him try his hand at thievery and meet an archer (Gerry Lopez) and a like-minded female robber (Sandahl Bergman). And it would be a kick-ass movie if all of the exciting parts weren't saved for the remaining forty minutes. ""Conan the Barbarian"" takes more than it's sweet time getting to the thrilling battle scenes that the movie seemed to promise at the start. Admittedly, there are plenty of hallmarks of a great adolescent fantasy sprinkled in the first half: more than a few topless ladies, Schwarzenegger playing the (mostly) silent hulking warrior, his delightfully buff lover (hello, Sandahl Bergman!), and the star even gets to punch out a camel.But it felt like a long slog through molasses until James Earl Jones showed up again. You know Conan's an unparalleled warrior, so why aren't we seeing this guy throw down? For most of the time, he broods more than he fights. And it's not until he goes on the offensive at the bad guy's palace that the swords start flying and the blood really starts to spill. Cue Basil Poledouris to ride in and save the day. Poledouris is the real star of this movie, with a thundering and chest-beating score that keeps you trudging on through the boring parts and catapults you into the sweet end-battle.5.5/10",Conan the Barbarian
25,siderite,Barbaric Chic,8,30 July 2021,"The movie is a mixed bag, bringing that great raw 80's experience, original ideas that are respectful to the material, but also that ridiculous 80's experience, where the people acting are not really actors and everything feels makeshift.Case in point: the feeling of the Hyborean age is great, magnified by the really powerful soundtrack and the choice of cast. You get Arnold, who's just huge, but also Sandahl Bergman and the two Tulsa henchmen. Subotai wasn't an actor, really, he was a surfer friend of Milius and you can tell he has been dubbed. Mako as the wizard and James Earl Jones as the villainous cult leader perfect the picture. In truth, they didn't need to act as much as be physical on screen. For a two hour long film, it only has about 600 lines of dialogue, many of which are from the narrator. And the fact that people are awkward and speak little adds value rather than remove it. The fighting style is also raw, based on physical power and badly choregraphed most of the time.I've seen a lot of people talking about the violence in the film. It really didn't feel that brutal. I mean, yeah, people are burned, decapitated, cut with swords, but there was little focus (or budget) on gore. It just felt natural in the story. Just as the many topless women. Yeah, women have breasts, get over it!All of this ""feels"" barbaric, it lends strength to the overall concept of the film and brings the viewer into the world that Milius created. The story is also quite interesting, a classic hero revenge arc. You can forgive the 20 million budget and the fact that everything looks cardboard. The editing is quite unpolished, too.Yet compare this with the 2011 Conan, which had a budget twice as big adjusted for inflation, the advantage of computer graphics and decades of film making experience and it felt like Aladdin or any of those Greek mythology films. It had no roots to stand on, no identity.Bottom line: not a perfect film by any means. Sometimes it's just feels boring and old and everything looks cheap. But Milius was able to render the soul of Conan in this film. That is something filmmakers can learn from.",Conan the Barbarian
26,Smells_Like_Cheese,Arnold's break-through,9,29 January 2010,"When I was a little girl, one of the movies my parents couldn't get enough of was the Conan movies. I remember watching them a bit with my parents, but I think I got sick of it. I haven't seen Conan or the sequel since I was 6 or 7 years old. I'm so strange, the other day I wasn't feeling so well, so I decided to stay in and just randomly decided to watch the Conan movies. I was a bit nervous since I hated watching it 5 million times with my parents, I was thinking I might have the same reaction, but luckily enough, I actually had a good time watching Conan. How could you not love Arnold Schwarzenegger? Not to mention this is his first major movie and to see him in his prime was awesome. Conan has everything that I loved about the old 1980's action/adventure movies: cheesy CGI effects, fun reactions from the actors, great stunts and a story of thrills. Conan witnesses the destruction of his village at the hand of Vanir warlord Thulsa Doom. Conan's father valiantly fights the bandits, but Thorgrim kills him with his pack of trained dogs and then kills Conan's mother. Sold into slavery along with the other children from his village, Conan is forced with others to push a human-powered mill. Reaching adulthood as the sole survivor, he has become broad and strong. After a period of enduring the elements, a lone horseman appears. Conan, it appears, is purchased on the premise that size alone is good enough to qualify him to fight as a gladiator. While still a slave, Conan studies language and writing including poetry and philosophy. He eventually however is set free by his master and soon discovers a sword from an ancient Atlantean king in a tomb. Conan thus dedicates his life to vengeance.Conan the Barbarian is a fun movie and really cheered my night up. I loved watching all the fight scenes, they were absolutely incredible, Arnold whipped that sword around as if it were a feather and was so graceful with it. James Earl Jones, another addition that you cannot go wrong with, he's the bad guy, it's like his calling card, he's perfect and has such a powerful presence on screen. The sets and direction also are done very well, John Milius did a great job and knew what the vision of this movie should have been like. I've heard before that these movies never did the stories of Conan any justice, but I haven't read them so I can't judge. Even so, I think people should give these movies a fair chance, if anything Conan the Barbarian is a fun action/adventure movie and takes us out of the world where dressing up in barbarian clothing is not just a sexual fetish but can be a good movie. 9/10",Conan the Barbarian
27,Rainey-Dawn,My Childhood Hero,10,29 June 2014,I was 10 years of age when this movie came out... Conan became my hero and I wanted to be Valeria. One of the best fantasy films ever! Who better to play Conan than our own Arnold Schwarzenegger?! I've always felt that he fit the role of Conan like a dead center bullseye shot - right on the money! The character of Valeria was no different because Sandahl Bergman was just as awesome in this film... and oh so beautiful! The rest of the cast was wonderful as well. I could go on and on about and the casting/acting - perfect! And the story of the life of Conan captured my imagination - it's still one of my all time favorite films. I can watch it again a feel just as entertained as the first time I viewed the flick.Conan the Barbarian (1982) one of best sword and sorcery fantasy films ever! I will recommend watching this movie followed by Conan the Destroyer (1984) for a great double feature! Rant: This movie is way to underrated on IMDb.10/10,Conan the Barbarian

29,lost-in-limbo,Flexing muscles with a bit of slaying on the side.,6,9 July 2006,"When Conan was a child his parents were murdered and he was captured for slave labour, which lasted for many years. Then through his young adulthood he was a pit-fighter, but he's let loose. So, this begins his journey, which he starts of as a petty thief, but then he realises he full potential of becoming an almighty swordsman. Wanting to avenge the deaths of his parents, committed by the evil snake god leader Thulsa Doom, he and a few allies decide to take on the towering figure.I don't know, but I never thought very highly, like many do of this pulp sword 'n' sorcery epic based on the fantasy / adventure stories by author Robert E. Howard. Strangely enough, I actually prefer its sequel and that hasn't change after re-watching the original again. But there's no denying the importance of the flick for Arnold Schwarzenegger and how it made him a household name. It's quite an ambitious film that demonstrates some well-shot features, a powerful score by Basil Poledouris, dreary solitude and primitive blood-splattering amongst the kitsch, but I found the yarn didn't entirely grip me and it doesn't capture my imagination. I even found the pacing to be quite sluggish with some creatively, impressive set pieces wrapped around the deflated story. Also at times it wallows a bit it on the pretentious side. The location of the film was extremely piercing with a decent visual scope evident, but I found the camera-work earlier on, got too close to the vigorous combat scenes with its panning, making it hard to make out what was happening. When the blood shed flies, it does so across the screen like in the gory battle climax, where it's truly in-your-face. Director John Milius gets the package done without a whole lot of flair, but imbued into it is grit and a mythological impact. The special effects can look campy, but they don't damage the flick and a stampeding score that evokes such a mystical edge about it crushes us. The plot I kind of found unexciting, it doesn't know where its truly heading and some happenings occur without any true reasoning. The script is filled with dim-witted, testosterone flying drawl, but you kind of expect it, based on the context and it can be quite unintentionally funny. The performances are rather stilted, but it's not the performances you focus on in a film like this. I say they were acceptable. Schwarzenegger does what he has to do and nails it down convincingly. While, James Earl Jones is strong in the powering villain role, Thulsa Doom. Maybe more so, as he only appears every so often. Sandahl Bergman and Ben Davidson are modest, and Max von Sydow clocks up a tiny part.While, I don't think too highly of it. It's still worth a look for its grand scale treatment and for Schwarzenegger's breakthrough performance.",Conan the Barbarian
30,Robert_duder,Took my expectations in a completely different direction,8,22 July 2008,"I had waited a long time to see this Arnold Schwarzenegger classic cult film and found both films on DVD for very cheap. I had very defined expectations of this film and turned out I was completely wrong in some ways. I had expectations that it would be cheesy, poor quality, bad editing, with monsters and characters that looked like the old dinosaurs from 50's movies and the original King Kong. So as I started to watch it I suddenly realized within the first few minutes that this was much more than I had expected. This was actually a big release in it's time with a decent budget and big backing behind it. The quality of the film was not gritty or poor at all, and the editing (particularly the sound) was as good as any film made during that time. The special effects were actually very well done and the pure violence and power of the film is really quite astounding. There are some great performance that hold the film together, a terrific epic story about vengeance and power, and the film is truly watchable not as an eighties cult classic, but as an actual medieval action flick comparable to anything in it's time. I am however blown away by the amount of IMDb reviewers that talk about this being there favorite film as a kid considering the sheer violence, nudity, and content of the film.Story has it that Arnold Schwarzenegger was still barely stumbling through English sentences when this was made. His dialog is practically non existent and if you're a Schwarzenegger fan from other action films you're going to want to hear that infamous voice more. Still he manages to create a powerful, royal-like character in Conan with sheer strength, body language and look. He's a better actor than people give him credit for and he really tries to show off his stuff in this role. He is heroic but in an almost anti hero way as Conan. Gerry Lopez is terrific as Conan's sidekick Subotai. The two make a great team without every really establishing a bond between them. They work great together and Lopez is terrific as Subotai. Mako adds a little flair to the cast as the Narrator for the first half and then the strange little Wizard from the second half. His character is fun and adds a little something different to the quiet, brooding, muscle ridden cast. Sandahl Bergman is apparently idolized for this role as well as her role in Red Sonja later on. I just think what I read about her kind of over hypes her as this graceful brilliant action heroine and maybe she was for her time because we hadn't seen the likes of Angelina Jolie, Demi Moore, Jody Foster, Xena...and so on who play strong, kick ass woman unapologetically. Bergman is tough and can wield a sword but she still has no problem peeling her clothes off to succumb to her man. Still her character adds the element of a deep romance which is good for the film. The mighty James Earl Jones is magnificent as the downright creepy, disturbing and demented Thulsa Doom. First of all he looks the part and makes you shudder just to see him and that voice and presence commands such a power house performance against Schwarzenegger. He is brilliant and possibly a top movie villain in my opinion.I have to give special mention to director John Milius who seems to really have a knack for writing and directing particularly bleak and powerful worlds (Conan, Red Dawn, Rome) that you are taken aback by the gritty feel to everything around it. I think that the way Conan is described and kept as a classic by people makes one think it's some sort of Indie low budget production when it actually cost as much as any big film during that time...Return of The Jedi, Blade Runner, etc. There are definitely classic moments in the film that you will remember forever including Conan's crucifixion, his battle with the enormous snake, and his battle with Doom himself. There are downsides to the film I think including the lack of character development with Conan and Subotai, the lack of dialog, and the poor choreography on some of the fights that has swords missing their mark by literally feet (ironically saying that Bergman lost her finger during filming by a sword that got too close.) Still those of you who think you don't like indie films you don't have to worry about Conan because it will entertain you like it was made yesterday and I'm looking forward to catching the sequel!! 8/10",Conan the Barbarian
31,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Not even a 'B-movie', just a boring one.",4,14 July 2018,"Conan's problem's start almost straight away and so do the film's, with the picture somehow managing to be remarkably boring even when it's doing all of the brutal, sword-and-no-sandals action it's entirely based around. It remains bizarrely barren for the majority of its run-time. Schwarzenegger certainly looks the part, with legend telling that he couldn't even initially hold the sword with two hands due to the size of his biceps and pecs, but his acting leaves something to be desired and so does his character. This will make you long for his comparatively Oscar-worthy work in later films or the performances in which he literally plays a robot. There's a constant disconnect from the world in 'Conan The Barbarian (1982)' and its inhabitants, which makes for an incredibly passive viewing experience that lacks the engagement or spectacle to make it even a 'B-movie' fascination, just a dull one. 4/10.",Conan the Barbarian
32,ericstevenson,Too many unpopular opinions,6,17 January 2017,"Once again, I feel bad for not liking this. I mean, it's by no means a bad film for me. I just thought it was okay. The strongest parts are probably when they're talking about God, Gods, whatever. These really are some interesting and very emotional scenes. My problem with this movie is that it was just too long. I mean, there were a lot of scenes that just seemed like filler. There was too much of Arnold/Conan just wandering around in the desert. The battle scenes are quite nice, but the timing just seems to be off. There are too many subplots with him meeting all these people.That being said, there are some great scenes. I think my favorite is the very last one where he burns down the palace. This is all done without dialogue and you can totally see how good the emotions are. I also really like the costumes in this. Everything just seems set so well in its time period and it all looks so authentic. I guess I just prefer Arnold Schwarzeneggar's later roles. James Earl Jones is quite good as the villain. It's just that a lot of it goes on too long. I remember how Barack Obama is a fan of ""Conan The Barbarian"". I guess you can think of this review as a tribute to him in his last days of President. I am not looking forward to Donald Trump. **1/2",Conan the Barbarian

The plot plods along a predictable path, and many of the actors seem to be just along for the achingly slow ride.

35,CuriosityKilledShawn,Powerhouse of Might and Magic!,8,12 September 2006,"Before CGI allowed filmmakers to cheaply create any fantasy world they can think of fantasy films had to rely on real locations, practical effects, and deep imagination to bring those worlds to life before the camera rather than in post-production. It may not be bestowed with Oscars, but Conan The Barbarian is just as classy as Ben Hur and more brutal than Gladiator.In an almost wordless set-up, a young Conan is orphaned by the androgynous warlord Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) and dragged off to some kind of weird labor camp where children are exploited and punished, kinda like a primitive version of Disneyland Paris. Years go by and Conan grows up into a huge, bloated and bulging muscle-bound killing machine.At this point, he is used as a money-making tool by his captors, who set up death matches with other killing machines. Soon, he becomes the most honored fighter in the land, so his captors set him free as he can win no more tournaments. In the opening act alone we see him transition from innocent child, to orphan, slave, gladiator, warrior, adventurer, and thief.He has a hard time surviving on his own until he finds a special sword, makes a new best friend in Subotai (Gerry Lopez) and finds a girlfriend in Valeria (Sandahl Bergman). Together, they live the high life of barbarians, mainly involving robbing, grunting, and clubbing people. All goes well until Conan makes it his personal quest to go after Thulsa Doom for revenge.James Earl Jones appears threatening, even though he doesn't even look like the kind of guy who would say boo to a goose. Imagine Oprah Winfrey in Hells Angels biker gear and you'll have an accurate description of Thulsa Doom. He's not a totally formidable foe for Conan in the larger-than-life sense, but psychologically he's a scary dude.Schwarzenegger does a great job. There really is only one person in the world who could play Conan, as sympathetic and brutal as he is, and Arnie definitely pulls it off, in this, his first major starring role. Of course, there is not much acting going on - he says only five words to Valeria in the whole movie - but it's all about physical presence, rather than thespianism. Most of the dialogue is unspoken. Conan was brought up to be a killing machine, but he learns humanity through feeling his own mortality.Producer Dino De Laurentiis, a veteran movie-maker, brought a whole load of money to give Conan a massive scale. John Milius stages some h-u-g-e scenes, with excellent production values, and his cinematographer Duke Callaghan uses widescreen framing brilliantly. The gore and violence is on a par with Paul Verhoeven and is so frequent that after a while it becomes almost comical. Basil Poledouris, who wrote wonderful music for RoboCop and many others, creates a truly majestic score that is absolutely spellbinding.As a tribute to Robert E. Howard's pulp hero, as a stand-alone movie, as an Arnie vehicle and cult picture, Conan is now almost a classic. Sure, there are faults, but you'll be too damn entertained to care.",Conan the Barbarian
36,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,Not Bad,6,28 August 2021,"I watched this movie because ""Geekyapar"" youtube channel recommended it. They were reviewing it in the ""Sinema Gunlukleri"" series. I think Arnold suits the role very well. Music was great. It was an average movie.",Conan the Barbarian
37,The-Sarkologist,"Not a classic in the true sense, but still one great movie",9,18 November 2011,"Conan is a movie of swords and sorcery and one of Arnold Swarztenegger's earliest. It was not his first but it was the movie that brought him fame. Conan is a movie with very little dialogue and the story is told through action and a narrative. When I first saw it I was a little put back at the lack of dialogue but now I think that it is an effective way of telling a story. I don't think that it would work that well with audiences, especially if they expect dialogue, but I think that it effective.Conan begins with Conan's village being attacked by a band of raiders bearing the standard of a snake cult. They slaughter the villagers, including Conan's mother and father, and take him as a slave. We later learn that they were after the secret of steel, which the village had, and they were caught by surprise giving the raiders and advantage. Conan grows up as a slave and later is thrown into a pit to test his worth. He begins to win victories and as his fame grows, he is rewarded with knowledge, and finally freedom. With his freedom he sets out to seek revenge for his fathers death.Conan is a story and not an intellectual film. The character Conan is reasonable, and we see how he is obsessed with revenge. He also believes that he is powerful but is humbled when he attempts to break into Thulsa Doom's (James Earl Jones) castle but is caught and crucified. His girlfriend saves him but forfeits her own life after they battle with spirits to prevent his soul from being taken.The movie is based on a comic strip and also a series of books by an author whose name escapes me. I have never read the books nor have I seen the comic strips so I do not know how close they have kept the character. Assuming Hollywood is typical then the character has probably been adjusted to suit them. I do not know whether the story is original or taken from the comic strip. Still, I enjoy the movie and would recommend it to others.",Conan the Barbarian

39,slightlymad22,Arnie Hits The Big Time,8,9 July 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie in order, I come to 1982's Conan The Barbarian. Plot In A Paragraph: Conan The Barbarian (Arnie) a slave turned out fighter, who sets off to avenge his tribe and his parents who were slain by an evil sorcerer (James Earl Jones) when he was a little boy.I loved the hell out of this movie as I kid, and my enthusiasm for it hasn't dimmed much over the years, however watching it now, two things struck me. I wonder how I was kept entertained during the long periods between the action, and my parents let me watch some REALLY inappropriate things. Basically back then, whatever my parents were watching, us kids had to watch or find another source of entertainment, as there was only one to and video recorder in the house. Arnie was paid $250,000 for this movie with the promise of 5% of any profits. However once producer Dino De Laurentis (who Arnie offended during a 1 minute 45 second meeting when he auditioned for Flash Gordon) came on board he first tried to get rid of him. Luckily for Arnie, director John Milus would not hear of it. So he settled for renegotiating his contract and removing his percentage of the profits. It's funny how Dino treated him early on in his career, as Arnie was loyal to him later. Arnies acting still isn't the best, but I think it works well for the role. James Earl Jones is in full pantomime villain mode and Max Von Sydow is almost unrecognisable save for his distinctive voice. Sandhal Bergman is stunning, and for someone who's previous acting career was limited to roles as Principal Dancer and Blonde Jogger she does a good job, Gerry Lopez is fine in his first role and Mako is OK too.With a great score, and a script by Millus himself and Oliver Stone (yes that Oliver Stone) it's well shot and has some wonderful cinematography and brilliant fighting scenes. Tame by today's standards really, but this was my first Arnie movie, and I recall being shocked at the amount of blood there was. Possibly THE most violent movie I had seen at that point. Such is my love for this movie, I have never rewatched the remake with Jason Moma.In his autobiography Total Recall, Arnie has some great stories about its trouble getting to the big screen, getting acting tips from James Earl Jones, why he didn't have a stunt double, getting past the censors and it's test screenings. Grossing $39 million at the domestic Box Office, Conan The Barbarian ended the year the 17th highest grossing movie of the year. Arnies biggest hit at that point. 8/10 for this Zoner. Maybe a little generous, but childhood nostalgia gets it an extra point. I didn't watch this and its sequel as much as Rocky IV and Rambo 2, but it's not far behind.",Conan the Barbarian

42,redryan64,"Being an Early Work of our beloved Governor of California; Also, a successful transfer of an Imaginary Prehistoric World from page to screen!, 7 January 2009",8,15 January 2009,"SEEMINGLY it took forever to get CONAN to the screen. After literally years of hemming & hawing, shuckin' & jivin' and otherwise put off; the script from Director John Milius for CONAN THE BARBARIAN (Dino DeLaurentis Pictures/Universal Pictures, 1982) finally saw the dark of the projection room, (As opposed to ""the Dark of Night"" or ""the light of Day!"").CLEVERLY and ever so wisely casting former Mr. Europe, Mr. Universe, Mr. World and multi-year Mr. Olympia winner, Arnold Schwarzennegar, Mr. Milius looked like a Cecil B. DeMille or a John Huston. Physically perfect, with a seeming drawback of having limited experience as an actor; and being confounded with a very German accent; plans went ahead to use the young Austrian.ODDLY enough, quite to the contrary Arnold's raw physical presence, his somewhat unpolished speaking and his youthful enthusiasm won out. The young immigrant bodybuilding champion became the living embodiment of Robert E. Howard's pulp magazine and (later) Marvel Comics headliner.SURVEYING the roster of cast members, one finds a very diverse and widely varying array of acting talent. On the one hand we have James Earl Jones (Thulsa Doom) and Max von Sydow (King Osric); who certainly represent a very high degree of ""class"" acting abilities and accomplishments. On the other hand, we have players such as Franco Colunbo (also a Pro Bodybuilder & Mr. Olympia winner) and big Ben Davidson (former Oakland Raiders Defensive End). Somewhere in the middle ground we find folks like Miss Sandahl Bergman (Valeria), Cassandra Gava (the Witch. Which witch?), Gerry Lopez (Suboti), Mako (doubling as the Wizard and the Narrator) former stunt-man and Western Player William Smith (Papa Conan, Sr.) Nadiuska (Conan's Madre) and many others in a cast of (literally) thousands.SEVERAL locations in Spain and in British Columbia worked out very well as they doubled for Europe in the last Post Ice Age Glacial period. The outdoor photography is excellent; even in the opinion of this writer, making a good run in rivalry for so much of that outstanding scenery and colour work that is seen in those John Ford Westerns.SUFFICE it to say that Mr. Milius and company did an outstanding job in bringing the World the view of a far different land. It's not like a HERCULES epic, nor is it TARZAN. It is just what we wanted; the World of the prolific young mind of Robert E. Howard.IT was followed by CONAN THE BARBARIAN (Dino DeLaurentis/Universal, 1984) and a CONAN Television Series (Multi Companies/1997).WHAT do you think that Schultz and meself give it for a rating?

43,poe426,Watered-down waste of time...,5,25 March 2009,"First, a confession: at the time of this movie's release, I went on record, in print (in an international movie magazine), saying that it wasn't bad (for every positive, however, there was a negative and the reservations I had then I still have now). Second: I've been a Robert E. Howard fan since I was a kid. Third: the comic book versions of Conan aren't to be confused in any way with the stories that Howard wrote. Nor is this movie. CONAN THE BARBARIAN hacks- er, harks- back to the earliest comic book version of the character. Prior to the release of the movie, director John Milius had promised to be faithful to the writings of Robert E. Howard: he would not, he defiantly proclaimed, give us ""a watered-down version of CONAN."" Well, guess what? He lied. It was painfully obvious, from the very beginning. Casting Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan seemed like a good (Hollywood) idea at the time, although the trailers showing the musclebound Austrian dancing around in slow motion with his sword in his hand (!) were patently ridiculous. (Yes, I know: that wasn't slow motion- but it sure looked like it; and WILL, any time you have a musclebound man doing badly choreographed action scenes.) To his credit, he was the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time; it was Milius who shoehorned him into a part he really had no business being in. The giant mechanical snake, which I likened at the time to ""a throwback to the heyday of Toho studios,"" was actually far less impressive than a guy in a rubber suit and James Earl Jones, badly miscast as a character from one of Howard's KING KULL stories, simply looks laughable in a fright wig. ""The orgy chamber orgy,"" I wrote, ""takes Conan where no barbarian has ever gone before."" Well, kinda. There was no orgy to speak of (we see little save the aftermath). As for the rest of the cast, the less said the better. The music, however, was great, and the cinematography was superb. This movie gave birth to a sequel (CONAN THE DESTROYER) which was even worse and a spin off (RED SONJA) that segued Howard's hard-hewn hero into a worthless teleseries (starring yet another musclebound mannequin) and even a (thankfully) short-lived cartoon series of forgettable proportions (though one must be thankful that it wasn't called something like BABY CONAN, BOY BARBARIAN).

It also has a (almost) all star cast with several other minor stars in it.There isn't much to the plot, the writing is very simple, but it moves every thing along really nicely and you don't have a chance to yawn or go to sleep.

47,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Adult fantasy told with the scale of a war epic,6,24 August 2011,"A film of few words, ""Conan the Barbarian"" strays from the path of most action films as far as storytelling goes. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who would become notorious for delivering one- liners has only one or two opportunities in this film. But how can one possibly complain about an action/adventure film that doesn't waste its time blabbering? ""Conan"" should be applauded for creating the epic feel of a war movie like ""Spartacus,"" but elaborate sets and costumes don't count as points toward character development.Writer and director John Milius, who penned ""Apocalypse Now,"" knows a thing or two about war films. Namely, he gets the power of telling a story without words. Except for a narrator, significant chunks of ""Conan"" are told with music and images that attempt to spin the story into a folk legend akin to Greek mythology. Aided with a healthy budget for creative and inspiring costumes and set pieces, ""Conan"" sells itself as a true epic.The lack of dialogue, however, causes a fair share of problems. Events seem to lack a rhyme or reason with only the thread of a common revenge tale holding it all together. Conan sees his parents die, gets sold into slavery, grows up, becomes a gladiator, trains to be a warrior and then is suddenly free. The film doesn't need dialogue for the sake of telling us what will happen next, but in developing some of the relationships between the characters that provides the motivation for the story to travel in one direction or another.Schwarzenegger wastes no time becoming an action hero you can root for. The script throws men waiting to be crushed and naked women at his feet and for a barbarian, he shows that he's not so much an animal as someone who refuses to act entirely human as a way of defying the system. When he's given a woman to mate with, for example, he doesn't simply take her and have her like a dog, and when he's in the arena, he clearly kills not for his owners, but out of some emotional void.On the opposite end of the spectrum is Thulsa Doom, played by James Earl Jones at the height of his ""voice of Darth Vader"" fame. An unforgettable villain from the name inward, Doom gives ""Conan"" the evil force it needs to make Conan's motivation function successfully. His philosophy of seeking human followers rather than wealth and riches makes him rather unique as well and it allows for some intriguing philosophy for an otherwise shallow movie.I suppose swords, sweat, snakes and sex have their place in adult action/fantasy; the trouble with ""Conan the Barbarian"" only lies within a conflict of objectives. The film cannot seem to settle on being more of a war epic or completely embracing its potential for cult fantasy. Its characters lack too much depth for the former and its story too long-winded and humorless for the latter. Either way, it presents a world and mythology that makes for an intriguing revenge tale.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Conan the Barbarian
48,funkyfry,"New version -- improved, but does Milius' vision come through?",7,2 March 2004,"Several notes here on Conan the Barbarian, which has just appeared on DVD and thus deserves and needs another look, for one thing because there is a new edit in this version which bolsters the story somewhat.First of all, the film must be seen relative to other fantasy films, both before and since.  In terms of the setting, costumes, and general look and feel of the film, it is one of the most ""authentic"" and convincing fantasy films ever, certainly surpassing anything before it.  The mountain of doom set is one of the most impressive ever built for such a film, and this type of construction is an extreme rarity these days -- only the Rohirrim city in ""LOTR"" can compare, largely because escalating costs in construction have met with declining costs in digital ""construction"".  The film should also be lauded because, especially when compared to previous fantasy films, even including the Harryhausen/Schneer Sinbad films, it takes itself seriously. This may be a flaw to some audiences, especially in the wake of ""Star Wars"" when the film came out, but I really think that because this is an adult fantasy story and not a comic book one (as others have suggested) it needed a fairly straightforward, non ""campy"" treatment.  It will, of course, be compared in the coming years to the ""LOTR"" movies, with which it can't hope to compete on many levels.  For one thing, Tolkien's work presents an integrated masterwork, whereas adapting Howard's short stories for an ""epic"" sensibility tends to degrade their value as simple pop entertainment.  However, in terms of the settings and costumes, this film is almost ""LOTR""'s equal.  Also, it features a more grown-up set of characters and sensibilities, including a cynical view of sexuality and violence which is absent from Tolkien's somewhat Victorian fantasy setting. 
Viewing the film relative to the original works of R.E. Howard, there are numerous aspects to complain about and some to praise.  Howard's stories were written and published in random order, choosing to tell Conan's life story, as Howard put it, in the order of interest, much as a seasoned warrior would tell his stories around a campfire (he wouldn't tend to begin with the relatively embarassing ""thieving"" career he embarked on in Zamora in his youth, as this film does).  This film, in attempting to appeal to as wide an audience as possible, has chosen to show Conan as a child and also to unify the story around a theme of revenge, something far alien from the world of Howard.  The fixation on one romantic object (Valeria) is also foreign to Howard's ethos; he tends to have Conan hook up with one ""lusty wench"" by the end of each story (usually having already rescued said wench from ape-men or pirates or whatever) but when next we see Conan no mention will be heard of this girl (presumably she was left in a bar somewhere in Khitai).  Howard's Conan stories are fantasy in a deliberately anti-epic mode, and this movie does not follow this.On the other hand, the producers wisely chose to exclude Howard's questionable racial theories and his eugenics.  They did an admirable job of creating the sense that his fantasy world is really an ancient version of our own, and also managed to bring into the script the sense that violence was more pervasive and authoritative in this society than any other virtue, which is very true to Howards' vision.  Conan himself is shown as a big stupid brute, which is not true to Howard's portrait of the character, who usually escapes situations more by brains (and his opponent's tendency to underestimate what he has of them) than by brawn.  However, this may be seen as fairly true to Howards' vision of a young Conan as seen in ""House of the Elephant God"".  The cities in particular have a great feel to them, very cramped and busy and dirty, with hundreds of pigs running around in the street and so on.  I really like the scene where Conan and Subotai get the black lotus and get high, as it introduces an amorality that is very strong in Howards' stories, but absent from most Hollywood ""heroic"" fantasy.As to Schwartenneger's performance, it is probably not very studied (in the commentary Arnold sounds like he doesn't understand the movie very much), but appropriate.  I think that physically someone who was more agile and less brawny would have been better (he looks very slow next to Valeria in the battle scenes, whereas Conan moved ""like a panther""), but perhaps as the producers said ""if Arnold hadn't existed for this movie, we would have had to create him.""Now to the new ending -- SPOILERS SPOILERS -- I think that it is much better, compared to the old ending.  Basically, he has brought the king's daughter into the final scene.  On the commentary track, Milius says his intention was to show that Conan could have taken Thulsa Doom's power, but chose instead to follow his own path, and this is shown through the king's daughter's actions and reactions to him.  However, viewing the film before I heard the commentary this intention wasn't exactly clear, so the producers' decision to truncate this ending for simplicity may be justifiable.All told, one of the best fantasy stories ever cinematically told.",Conan the Barbarian
49,GOWBTW,A Classic Schwarzenegger film!,10,31 August 2018,"I was too young to see this film back, but now I will get the chance to learn how it is a legend in the making. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the iconic barbarian, Conan. He goes on a major quest to take out the murderer of his parents when he was a young boy. Thulsa Doom(James Earl Jones) is the leader of a snake cult that has taken a lot of people under his sway. While being shaped into a hulking fighter, Conan has joined Valeria(Sandahl Bergman), Subotai his first companion who follows Conan on his quest. 
This movie is a top-notch hit. It revels in total debauchery, brutal combats, lots of sexual tensions between Conan and Valeria. If you enjoyed the comics by Marvel, the movie is great. 
5 stars!",Conan the Barbarian
50,elshikh4,A Different Action !,6,21 August 2013,"Back then, they were the days of sword and sorcery movies, where sword beats sorcery, based on (Robert E. Howard) stories trend. Because after 20 years, we would have another sword and sorcery movies, where sorcery beats sword, based on (J. R. R. Tolkien) stories trend. I believe the first kind harmonized with the metallic, one-man-army, action hero of the 1980s; such as (Conan), (The Beastmaster), He-Man in (Masters of the Universe), and else. And the second kind harmonized with the sorcerer kid of the 2000s; such as (Harry Potter), (Lord of the Rings), and even (Spy Kids) in a way that substitutes sorcery with sci-fi.In (Conan the Barbarian), (Schwarzenegger) proved himself as one of the best metallic heroes of the era (In the 1970s, Charles Bronson, another metallic hero, was considered for playing Conan). He's a man of a few words. I liked the fact that he spoke just 5 words to his girl during the whole movie! And this is great, considering the known nature of these movies, whereas - frankly - the muscles are needed above anything else. In a word, he played the metallically written character perfectly metallic!Generally, it's an effective movie that makes you believe. The production is generous, the cinematography is dazzling, the sets are inspiring, and the fights are memorable, simply because they were so real; remember that (Schwarzenegger) required many stitches, and suffered a back injury. Not to mention that (Sandahl Bergman) had the tip of one finger cut off while shooting a sword-fight. Well, they're things that you won't find in the CGI action of today's movies!Still, the movie's pace is one of the most interesting points. It isn't another action with desert adventures, and hot sword-fights; it is rather more atmospheric and sullen. It added a considerable portion of realism and seriousness, which ensured a different sense and meditative taste.Speaking about the ""seriousness"" and ""meditation"" leads to the most interesting point at all. The movie isn't a revenge story only, it has more to it. It's where the ""sword"" is barbarian idolatrous man, and his enemy, the ""sorcery"", is civilized religious dictator. So when the first bests the second eventually; it's not the usual happy end of similar revenge stories; it exceeds this..It's strange to have the barbarian as the heroic figure, and the civilized as the nasty evilness. Then to make the idolatrous man vanquishes the religious dictator. But is it the movie's intellectual viewpoint: barbarianism is better than despotism, and idolatry is better than self worship?!You may think that it somehow refuses the dark ages while supporting darker ages. But for me, when despotism has no ethics, then it is barbaric. Plus idolatry and self worship are alike. So I see the case as barbarian idolatrous man fighting another barbarian idolatrous man, yet more powerful, to end the latter's unfairness. And there is a fervent speech against religious dictatorship after all. Otherwise, this is a Hollywood product, that provides yet another hero, another evil guy, in another conflict, but with new age this round; that kind of harmonizes with Hollywood dogma of having mostly non religious lead, or no religion in the first place; for the sake of winning the various international audience, or maybe supporting anything but spiritual matters!For others, the movie has else meanings though, which range between being ""an analogy of Christ's life"", ""a Nazi story where a Nordic superman slices off a black's head"", and ""an allegory for Ronald Reagan's cold war with the Soviets"" (??!!), all made by guys who think a bit too much as you see!The cons can be felt in few elements: I hated the sex and the nudity; they are always despised from my side, so how about plenty of them this round. The music score was so loudly bombastic to boring and annoying extent. (Gerry Lopez) is anything but a funny sidekick. The matter of the antagonist's daughter falling in love with the protagonist at the end was too fast to believe. And the climax lacks a satisfying final encounter between the movie's 2 conflicting powers; (James Earl Jones)'s head flies too quickly, disappointing fairer climax!This is a commercial action movie with abundant sex and violence, and I'm not fond of that. However, it wins being different due to having some artistic elements; like aesthetic cinematography, distinct pace, and forceful atmosphere. Its message is controversial, which adds to its difference, by originally having a message in a movie of this kind. Now, I am fond of that.",Conan the Barbarian
51,jamesrupert2014,Fondly remembered (albeit somewhat silly) sword-and-sorcery saga,7,30 August 2020,"Young Conan witnesses the brutal murder of his parents at the hands of Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) and his minions, is enslaved, becomes huge, learns to fight, and finally seeks revenge against Doom, now the mystical leader of a snake-cult. Schwarzenegger had the build to play the famously muscular Cimmerian swordsman whose rampage through the pulps began during the Great Depression, and the one-time Mr. Universe acquits himself well in the numerous fight scenes (just as well, because the big guy is not much of a runner). 'Ah-nuld's' much imitated Austrian accent blends in well with the gloriously random mix of ancient cultures that forms the film's almost tongue-in-cheek core aesthetic. Jones, with a hammily-menacing stare and ominous voice, makes a good villain and, as Conan's wingmen, Japanese character actor Mako and surfer/thespian Gerry Lopez are entertaining enough. Distaff carnage was provided by statuesque dancer Sandahl Bergman (more of a visual than an aural asset) as Valeria: a sexy thief and Conan's doomed squeeze. John Milius' film has a bit of that Italian cheesy-epic feel (Raffaella De Laurentiis was one of the producers) but the whole story is so grounded in the world of pulp-fantasy that a straight-faced version may have ended up an inadvertent comedy. Broadly entertaining and memorably goofy, 'Conan the Barbarian' was made a couple of years before 'The Terminator', and if the film didn't launch Schwarzenegger's improbable rise to global stardom, it at least helped fuel the rocket.",Conan the Barbarian
52,dee.reid,"""Conan the Barbarian"" - Sword-swinging, epic entertainment",8,16 May 2005,"The realm of fantasy is a difficult genre for filmmakers to grasp and master, with many films either being spectacular successes (i.e., ""Star Wars"" or ""The Lord of the Rings""), cult icons, or disastrous failures; ""Conan the Barbarian"" is the cult icon.Released in 1982, with a script co-authored by Oliver Stone and directed by John Milius, ""Conan the Barbarian"" rocketed its star Arnold Schwarzenegger into the Hollywood spotlight, which would be cemented two years later in 1984 by his role as the cyborg killer in ""The Terminator."" Schwarzenegger gives what could very easily be considered one of his best and most overlooked performances as Robert E. Howard's muscular sword-swinging cult hero.In a story that strangely enough mirrors the life of the film's star, a horde of bloodthirsty raiders led by Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) massacres his peaceful Cimmerian village, murders his parents, and in turn this becomes an event that leads a young Conan into 15 years of slavery grinding grain on the Wheel of Pain. By the time that we're in the present, Conan (Schwarzenegger), now an adult, has forged a magnificent body and finds eventual use by his owner as a pit-fighter.This earns him a degree of infamy, as one after one, many pit combatants meet their demises at the hands of savage Conan. Soon after, he is freed and left to roam the desert countryside all by himself. He soon finds a king's sword, which will come in handy in the many battles that await him.He finds comradeship with Subotai the Mongol (Gerry Lopez) and romances the very tough but very HOT Valeria, the Queen of Thieves (Sandahl Bergman). Eventually, along with some spiritual aid from The Wizard (Mako, also the story's narrator), the four become a team of unlikely allies, as they all come from vastly different backgrounds, and organize their respective talents to battle Doom's evil snake cult.Many people may often tend to look at ""Conan the Barbarian"" and just think of it as an early wooden performance from stone-faced Schwarzenegger, which really couldn't be any farther from the truth, in my view.The immortal, so-called ""Riddle of Steel"" and other mystical Asian and Middle Eastern philosophies abound in the film's script. The Riddle of Steel ultimately asks a fundamental question that could still hold true today (in some respects), the question of which is more powerful, the steel, or the mighty hand that wields it?These sort of mystical questions and philosophies allow ""Conan the Barbarian"" to elevate itself above any average qualities and into cult icon status; this film's apparent devoted fanbase might confirm my assertions. The film's costumes are certainly representative of the setting, and certainly do look like they were worn on and off the set.The epic musical score by Basil Poledouris is also worth some special mention. According to IMDb's trivia section, this score has been used as a temp track a lot in subsequent films and television trailers, but has never been matched in terms of quality and audience arousal.Schwarzenegger is good, his performance is a bit choppy in some places but then again, what are we to really expect? Even though this film is deep thematically, it's serving two purpose in regards to its star: 1) to get Schwarzenegger into Hollywood stardom and 2) show off his muscles and labor-forged torso.The supporting roles are excellent and keep the film above water, especially from Gerry Lopez as the Mongol and Golden Globe-winning actress Sandahl Bergman as Conan's love interest. The best role of course, is that of James Earl Jones as the very evil Thulsa Doom. Jones is vile and repulsive as this wicked sorcerer who's bent on achieving immortality, willingly sacrifices his female followers without hesitation or remorse, and also has a seemingly unhealthy relationship with snakes.Well, should Schwarzenegger fans see it? Yes. Did I like it? Yes. Will fans of Robert E. Howard like it? Yes.""Conan the Barbarian"" is an excellent fantasy adventure that's held up well since its time in theaters 23 years ago in 1982. It's achieved an important cult icon status that hasn't diminished at all. (That could be because of the adolescents who view this movie as a living representation of their innermost fantasies - the sword-swinging hero who goes on wild adventures, beds a beautiful female warrior, slays an evil madman, and becomes a king - all the stuff of incessant teenage daydreaming.)Beware though, as with any mature fantasy, ""Conan the Barbarian"" is by no means a children's movie and its ""R"" rating is there for good reason. This film's explicit sex scenes, excessive nudity, and graphic sword + sorcery combat violence should definitely win over those looking to quench their voracious bloodlusts.8/10",Conan the Barbarian
53,JoeB131,"""to hear the lamentations of the women!""",8,22 November 2011,"This movie is cheesy, but it's really good, Wisconsin grade cheese, so that makes it fun. It also hearkened back to a day when they built real sets, did real action and just didn't have actors stand in front of Green Screens and pretend that they cared.This was Arnold's first movie where he had to act, and he had a long way to go. His first line, 23 minutes into the film, is hilarious because of the way it was shot.But the action scenes are great, and Arnold looks good in the role. He is matched against a really good villain in James Earl Jones. The pacing is solid.God, I miss the 1980's.",Conan the Barbarian
54,MBunge,Perhaps the best sword 'n sorcery movie ever,8,13 May 2010,"If you've only seen this movie in an edited form on cable TV, you've got to go out and rent the original. And not just because it has naked boobs and more blood in it.Based on the brilliant short stories of Robert E. Howard, Conan The Barbarian tells the story of young boy who watches as his family and his village are destroyed by a band of marauders and grows up to seek revenge. Along the way, Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) hooks up with Subotai (Gerry Lopez), a thief and archer, and falls in love with Valeria (Sandahl Bergman), a warrior woman.The first bit of praise for this film has to go to the music. This is probably one of the best soundtracks ever for an action/adventure film, and that's central to the appeal of the movie because it's drenched in music to an almost operatic extent. In fact, The majority of Conan The Barbarian is without words. It's just action on the screen and the soaring, pounding, solemn and funny score of composer Basil Poledouris. This isn't a film that just needed an opening theme and some short musical cues to get it from scene to scene. Poledouris had to come up with several complete instrumental pieces, each of which has to strike a different tone depending on what's going on in the story. The music in Conan the Barbarian is so good, I would actually encourage a blind person to ""watch"" it if they couldn't get their hands on a copy of the soundtrack.The second thing that deserves recognition is the quality of the writing. When a movie doesn't have its first conversation take place until 25 minutes into the story, you generally wouldn't think of that movie as being well-written. But Conan The Barbarian clocks in at over two hours and there are no dead spots in the film where you're just waiting for what comes next. This is a film that shows us who its characters are instead of telling us. It shows us what they're feeling and how they're strong and where they're weak. And while there's not much said, there are a lot of memorable lines. Conan The Barbarian may take the prize for highest ratio of great lines to overall amount of dialog. ""Contemplate this upon the Tree of Woe."" What is best in life? ""To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of the women!"" ""He is Conan, Cimmerian. He will not cry. So I cry for him"". ""Let me breathe my last breath into your mouth."" ""Now they will learn why they are afraid of the dark. Now they will learn why the fear they night"". And what's also notable about the writing is that much of the dialog sounds contemporary, like it could have been written last week. Too many scripts reflect the speech patterns and vernacular of the moment in which they were written. Conan's goes beyond that and builds its dialog on real situations, behavior and feelings that transcend any particular era.There's also some pretty good acting in this movie. James Earl Jones is magnetic as Thulsa Doom, the man who destroyed Conan's world. Sandahl Bergman is wonderful as the strong woman who gives her heart and her life to Conan. Gerry Lopez manages to make Subotai into Conan's companion, not his sidekick. Mako as the Wizard who chronicles Conan's tale and Max Von Sydow as King Osric, the man who hires the three thieves to steal his daughter back from Thulsa Doom, are also wonderful. These actors give the sort of performances you always want to see, making you believe that these characters have a history and a depth that goes beyond what's on the screen.And while no one would really call Arnold Schwarzenegger a great actor, he has come up with some great performances and this is one. His Conan is uncomplicated and not quite as smart as the other people in the story, but there's nothing cartoonish about him. He's a simple character but one who feels real, deep emotions. Some might dismiss his work here and in The Terminator by calling it perfect casting, but the fact that other, more talented actors couldn't match his acting in those roles is a credit to Arnold and the people who cast him.The look of this movie is also outstanding. The costumes and sets may have been created almost 30 years ago, but they look as good as anything you'd see in a sword-and-sorcery flick today. At a time in movie history when you actually had to built sets and not just throw up a green screen and let a computer do everything, the filmmakers create a believable and visually attractive world. Nothing in this movie looks fake or contrived or like something no one would ever really wear or ever really live in.And as I said before, you really need to see the original cut and not the version edited for TV. I've seen both and there are so many little moments in the original that give the story a greater emotional and artistic heft that you really do miss something when they're gone.Conan The Barbarian came out in 1982 and I've seen it numerous times on TV and on videotape in the following years, but when I watched it again to do this reviewI enjoyed it just as much as I ever did. Movies don't get much better than that.",Conan the Barbarian
55,Fluke_Skywalker,This you can trust,7,9 December 2015,"Effort can cover a lot of sins, and so it is with John Milius' take on Robert. E. Howard's pulp anti-hero Conan. It's not a great film, and maybe not even a good one, but it feeds off of the energy and total commitment of all those involved.Arnold Schwarzenegger brings his unmatched physicality and natural charisma and he's blessed with an excellent supporting cast. Veterans James Earl Jones and Max von Sydow add gravitas, while co-star Sandahl Bergman more than holds her own swinging a sword beside Arnold.And honestly, if you're not on board with this film after the first few notes of the late great Basil Poledouris' ""Anvil Of Crom"", then there's no hope for you.",Conan the Barbarian
56,jimbo-53-186511,Conan the bore-barian,2,8 July 2017,"When his family and tribe are killed by an evil sorcerer named Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) young Conan is enslaved by this cult and is trained to become a fierce warrior. When Conan is set free as an adult, he seeks revenge against Doom.Conan the barbarian is another film that I seemed to remember as not being too bad when I watched it a number of years ago when I was a child. I decided to watch it again as an adult and can't decide whether it was a bad film when I watched it (and I'd forgot) or that my opinion on it has changed now that I'm an adult...At its heart this is your typical basic revenge film, but in Conan the barbarian the revenge element seems to take a backseat and for the most part the film is chocked full of weirdness - all the sorcery, wizardry and gods knows what else seems to dominate the film. The odd thing is that the sorcery and wizardry nonsense never seemed to have any connection to the revenge element of the story and at times it felt like I was watching two different films (sadly neither of which was particularly entertaining). For me, the whole film was a bit too whacked out and weird (and sadly not in an enjoyable way). It just felt weird for the sake of being weird in my opinion.Aside from the above other issues with the film are that it is dull and overlong and with next to no character development, little action, and several nonsensical plot elements this is not an easy film to sit through during its 2 hour running time. The voice-over narrative is terrible, rather cheesy and also didn't feel entirely necessary.As far as the performances go then they are pretty much as bad as you'd expect with only James Earl Jones giving a fairly credible performance. Schwarzenegger isn't the greatest of actors and this is something that filmmakers started to learn in his later career; I think that's why a lot of his characters in later films were played in a more tongue-in-cheek fun way as it helped to distract from his weak acting. In Conan the barbarian, the tone is quite dark and the feel is mostly serious and this exposes Arnie's weaknesses as an actor all the more. Like I say, this is something that filmmakers would improve upon with Arnie in time and by the late 80's they'd pretty much perfected the formula.Conan the barbarian is nowhere near as good as I remember it to be and my view on it today is that it's a dull, nonsensical and rather uninteresting affair from start to finish. Had it played out as a more straight-forward revenge film and had it been a bit more fun then I think it would have been far more enjoyable.",Conan the Barbarian

58,slokes,"Big Man, Small Story",5,31 July 2013,"In 1982, a movie was supposed to serve as the breakout device for an adventure fiction icon. Instead we got a two-decade pop-culture phenomenon named Ah-nold.Even though I've come to like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and find things in this, his first big action role, to enjoy, I felt shortchanged then and still do now. A character brimming with intrigue and life like Robert E. Howard's Conan deserved better than a rote tale that highlights the director's fixation with Nietzsche and will-to-power thematics over realizing a compelling alternate world of fantasy and magic.Something's wrong the moment we meet our main character as played by Schwarzenegger. He's walking around in circles amid a high arid landscape, pushing something called ""The Wheel of Pain"" that seems to be a mill of some kind but serves no apparent function. He's literally stuck in the middle of nowhere, walking in circles to no apparent purpose.This continues for much of the film. Picking up bits of stories that would be known to Howard readers in a kind of mash-up form, we see Conan at work as pit warrior, thief, and avenger, the latter being the main business of this film. Years ago, when he was a boy, Conan watched a warlord named Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) ride into Conan's village and kill his parents. After about an hour of grunting, running, and stabbing, Conan discovers a clue as to where this Thulsa Doom might be, and sets out to settle a score.It's around here that the story, written by director John Milius and Oliver Stone, finds its groove. Jones is a cool villain, the kind who can make one of Milius's philosophical exposition scenes work with a single jab of his finger. Never mind that the guy looks like a Breck girl with his long, straight hair, he's the class of the production.Schwarzenegger makes an impression, too. First it's his physique, as a lot of labored, stretchy scenes call upon him to do little else but flex his muscles and mutter ""Crom!"" now and then. But Schwarzenegger's considerable charm and way with a camera come across as the film rolls on. He is not a strong actor here, but from the moment he punches a camel in a crowded street, a kind of gonzo energy works its way into Schwarzenegger's performance, a sense that he's making us laugh on purpose and enjoying it.As to the rest of the cast, Sandahl Bergman looks good, moves better, but can't deliver a line convincingly as Conan's lover Valeria, while Max Von Sydow overplays a silly scene as a vexed king. Better are Mako as a wily wizard and Gerry Lopez, apparently a full-time surfer from what Milius says on the DVD commentary, who plays the thief Subotai and brings some badly needed charm and sympathy to the proceedings before the Arnold we all know finally shows up.The film builds to a gripping conclusion, if one borrowed from Milius's ""Apocalypse Now"" script like other reviewers here have noted. Of course, when the blood flows as thick as it does in the last half-hour of this movie, it's not hard getting and keeping an audience's attention.As a Conan fan, I would have liked more development of the world Conan lived in and the people around him, if not as conceived by Howard at least re-imagined convincingly by Milius. Here you get some visually arresting sets, a rich Basil Poledouris score, and Arnold in his youthful prime, but none of it really comes together, except a little near the end. It's not a bad film, but it's not a world I want to go back to like I do that of Howard's Conan.",Conan the Barbarian
59,dworldeater,What is best in film,10,1 December 2014,"With 1982 classic Conan The Barbarian, writer/director John Milius and champion bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger not only made the best fantasy adventure movie of the 1980's, but also one of the finest motion pictures ever. I applaud director John Milius's choices. Although unconventional, he made them work. Casting many non actors with Arnold as the lead was one of them. What Arnold lacked in acting skills, he more than made up for with presence, charisma and the ambition and dedication to succeed. His million dollar physique and massive athleticism did'nt hurt either. Plus Milius, made the best use of the rest of the cast. James Earl Jones brings class and menace to evil cult leader Thulsa Doom. Max Von Sydow has a brief but memorable cameo as King Osric. Although definitely in the fantasy realm, most of what is contained in the film is authentic and realistic. In this period(the early 80's)many of these type of films were taken less seriously by those that made them and were very campy and tongue in cheek. The tone of this film is pretty serious. While there are a few one liners and some humor sprinkled around, this project has a deadly serious theme of revenge and Conan is a product of tragedy and violence. The film looks sharp and the sets, costumes and weapons are all top notch. The action choreography is fluent and the fight scenes look great. Basil Poledouris's epic score is truly the best and helps carry along the story with little dialogue. It also gives the film an operatic quality that makes the film more powerful and gives it a lot of class as well. Conan The Barbarian is a timeless classic that holds up well. John Milius is truly a genius and one of the most underrated filmmakers of our time.",Conan the Barbarian
60,Witchfinder-General-666,"Between the Time when the Oceans Drank Atlantis, and the Rise of the Sons of Aryas...",9,23 July 2008,"Let's face it - The ""Sword And Sorcery"" genre is not exactly known as the best in cinema, and for good reasons. Most specimen of this particular Fantasy sub-genre range from entertaining cheese to boring cheese, depending mainly on the level of sleaze and violence. Of course, the low quality of the vast majority of these films (which I usually still enjoy immensely) is partly due to low budgets and the lack of real actors, but mainly due to the fact that these films (especially those from the 80s) are entirely unworthy and unspeakably inferior rip-offs of the one supreme highlight of the genre - The awesome, unmatched and totally bad-ass ""Conan The Barbarian"". Besides the original ""Terminator"" of 1984 and ""Total Recall"", this 1982 cult-flick is easily the greatest film that Arnold Schwarzenegger ever starred in, and it outshines everything else in the field by far, and in all aspects.The film starts out with the Nietzsche Quote ""That Which Does Not Kill Us Makes Us Stronger"", and it immediately continues equally archaic with the voice of a mysterious narrator who announces the tale of Conan. The film is set in a mysterious ancient time (""between the time when the oceans drank Atlantis, and the rise of the sons of Aryas""). As a young Cimmerian boy, Conan sees his northern village destroyed and his people killed by the armies of the warlord Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), who declares himself a god. The boy is enslaved, and, over the years of working in a mill called the wheel of pain, he becomes stronger and stronger. Adult Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) becomes a gladiator, and subsequently a powerful warrior - with the intention to avenge his people...The film's raw, archaic atmosphere, fantastic sceneries and characters, and especially its fascinating mythology make this an absolute must- see for every fan of Fantasy, 80s cinema, or even films in general. The role of Conan fits Arnold Schwarzenegger like a glove, and it is hardly imaginable for anybody else to play the role. The performances of Schwarzenegger as Conan and and Sandahl Bergman, who plays Conan's lover and partner in battle, the Amazon warrior Valeria, are not exactly masterstrokes of brilliant acting, but this is not the point. The main intention for Conan is to look (and be) archaic and grim - and he does. The main intention for Valeria is to look like a wild Warrior princess - and she does. Therefore, Schwarzenegger and Bergmann fit perfectly in their roles. Apart from Miss Bergmann, there are several other beautiful female cast members, such as Cassandra Gaviola who is great as a witch, and the late Valérie Quennessen who plays a princess. Mako, who plays the Wizard who also narrates the story is also great in his role, and the supporting cast includes the great Max Von Sydow. THE great performance in the film, however, is that of James Earl Jones. Jones is brilliant in his villainous role Thulsa Doom. Mysterious, diabolical, haunting, incomparably menacing and absolutely brilliant - these are just some of the words to describe the role of Thulsa Doom, and James Earl Jones plays the role with ingenious perfection.The atmosphere is raw, archaic and absolutely fascinating, throughout. The combination of brutish battle, and surreal and supernatural elements, the sorcery and bizarre rituals - all these elements make this film so fascinating. The film is outstandingly photographed in ingenious settings, and visually stunning from the beginning to the end. Director John Milius deserves big praise for his visual talent in this film alone. This is a film that was fascinating in my childhood, and it is still awesome as an adult. ""Conan The Barbarian"" is THE highlight in the Sword And Sorcery genre, and a stunning cult-flick that should not be missed. The awesome finale will leave you breathless. Highly recommended!",Conan the Barbarian
61,Enchorde,"Nice battles, not so good story...",6,3 October 2004,"** HERE BE SPOILERS **When Conan is just a young boy his village is attacked by Thulsa Doom and his allies. The village is destroyed and Conan's parents are killed in front of his eyes. The children of the village, which seems to be the only survivors is lead of to the north to become slaves. Conan grows up to be a slave labourer, but when he is older is turned into a gladiator. One night he is set free and old memories of freedom and revenge come alive again. He accepts the quest of a king to steal back the king's daughter from Thulsa Doom, who now leads a snake cult. But Conan has some revenge of his own in mind.Although very violent, this movie is not a stream of battle and fight. Long sequences is devoted to tell Conan's history, from the attack of his village to the present adventures. Also there are some scenes that shows his far journeys. This sets the mood of the movie to a kind of tragic, and Conan himself is bitterly determined and offer few words to his companions. This might be in line with his personality but the movie and story lacks a little. Even if his lack of words tells us much of the character we might have learned more from a healthy dialog. There are some discussions about gods, and Conan cannot fulfill his destiny until he has come to terms with his own god.The fight-scenes are good, not choreographed like dances like many fights in movies of today, Conan's technique obviously relies more on force. His style reflects his ""barbarian"" heritage. Shwarzenegger is perfect as Conan, only someone with his physique could be a plausible Conan. The other cast and characters are good as well, though there is no room in the movie to learn another character, due to the above mentioned lack of dialog and the focus on Conan. All in all, the movie is above average due to good fights and a good effort from the makers to make a movie with good details in weapons and uniforms. The magic and spirit parts do not bring something to the movie or story and should, in my opinion, have been cut. But I guess there had to be some in a movie like this.6/10",Conan the Barbarian

With the aid of his friends, Valeria and Subotai, he sets out to destroy Doom and his evil cult of snake worshippers.This fantastic and gorgeous-looking adventure epic is one of the few sword-and-sorcery action movies which really manages to capture the essence of the pulp novels and comic-books from which it is derived. It does this by being way over the top - full of flesh and blood, fights, stunts, monsters, special effects, incredible sets, bizarre costumes and weird weapons - but also by playing it true to the source material. This was Schwarzenegger's first lead role (though he's good in a couple of earlier movies, Stay Hungry and The Villain) and he's perfect for the part; okay he doesn't say much, but he doesn't need to, he simply is Conan. This movie doesn't need dialogue; it has amazing scenes and a fabulous thumping score by action-movie specialist Basil Poledouris which drives it headlong, smashing through the story with adrenaline and romance in equal measures. The whole cast are terrific and perfectly physical; Bergman is the definitive Amazonian / Valkyrie warrior woman (check her out also in Red Sonja and Hell Comes To Frogtown), and Lopez (a champion surfer from Hawaii) is excellent as the heroic Subotai. Jones gives one of the strangest, most hypnotic villain performances you'll ever see, and cult-movie stalwarts Mako and Von Sydow are dependable as ever. Note also Danish actor Thorsen as the hammer-wielding Thorgrim; he's an old bodybuilding pal of Arnie's who has bits in many of the great man's movies and plays heavies in lots of other good films too. Perhaps the best work in this movie though is the production design by Ron Cobb (Dark Star, Aliens, Total Recall). The incredible sets really bring the mythic age to life, and there are many eye-popping moments - the endless line of acolytes filing towards the temple, the buzzard attendants at Conan's crucifixion, the cannibalistic orgy that ends in a bloodbath, Valeria's funeral pyre blazing in the darkness, as well as all the beheadings, stabbings, beatings and general mayhem. The only phrase to describe it all is bloody good fun. Shot in British Columbia and Andalucía, and followed by an enjoyable sequel, Conan The Destroyer. Written by Milius and Oliver Stone (a strange right-meets-left political pair), this is a sensational realisation of the writings of Robert E. Lee (the Conan stories were originally published between 1932 and 1936 in Weird Tales magazine) and the work of artists like Frank Frazetta and Boris Vallejo.

Conan the Barbarian is one of the few fantasy movies to combine a good story, with excellent production values and believable acting, all tied up with a score that it is just perfect for the film.Likewise, there are some roles where you can't help but feel that no one else but the original actor can play that part...ever! Arnold Schwarzenegger is Conan. No if's, but's or maybe's about it. I can't think of anyone who could do the role justice and I don't mean just physically. Let's be honest, Arnie isn't a fantastic actor, but he knows what he can and can't get away with. And the strong, silent hero (or villain, a la Terminator) is his forte.Add to his performance the likes of James Earl Jones as the bad guy, Mako as the wizard and a great performance by Gerry Lopez (who was a surfer, I believe) as Conan's side-kick and you can't really go too wrong.Basil Poledouris' score is first class and really captures the mood and theme of the whole film. His ""Anvil of Crom"" theme will always be one of my favourites.The plot is interesting in that its a classic tale of revenge, with Conan seeking the warlord that murdered his people whilst he was only a child. The fact that the warlord has become the leader of an evil cult and that kings and rulers would also like him dead means nothing to Conan. Revenge is all he is interested in. Nothing more, nothing less.This is a great movie and well worth watching. Even taking into consideration such recent films as LOTR it still holds up well on its own merits and will do for years to come.",Conan the Barbarian
65,eric262003,An Excellent Early Arnold Film,7,25 July 2021,"Under the direction of John Milius based off of the creative writing for pulp writer Robert E. Howard, Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as the titular character ""Conan the Barbarian"", a film that would lead him to bigger things in the future. After the horrific death of his parents, young Conan (Jorge Sanz) was abducted by the evil warlord Thulsa Doom, where he is badly tortured and endured such punishment like being chained to the Wheel of Pain and was forced to serve as a Pitt Fighter. And though many people who have had to go throught this cruel punishment would be permanently scarred both physically and mentally, Conan found both physical strength and inner determination that would result in him becoming a free man. With the help of his cohorts Subotai (Gerry Lopez) and Valeria (Sandahl Bergman), Conan makes it his mission to decipher the ""riddle of steel"", gain as much power and to defeat Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) after what he did to his family.And sure this film launched a sequel two years later (""Conan the Destroyer"" ) and had other films adapted from Robert E. Howards like ""Red Sonja"" and ""Kull the Conqueror"" and then got a remake in 2011 starring Jason Momoa, until I received the Blu-ray edition, I had never fully sat through the whole thing, just a few fragments of it. But once I sat through its entirety, I was left quite stunned at the outcome.Overall it was a very good watch, the scenery, the settings, the costumes and the characters felt very much like it was taken out of the pages of Howard's novels and brought new life when this movir hit the big screen. The direction by John Milius really paid a great deal of respect to Howard's pulp novels it'll leave you with positive vibes once the credits start rolling. The images that materialize on the screen look like something that came out of a painting that was done by Frank Frazetta. The real star of the film was the excellent score composed by Basil Poledouris that perfectly follows each scenery organically. The score itself is the heart and soul that carries the movie making it a character of its own. The casting choices were almost perfect as I found no one being miscast in their respected performances. James Earl Jones actually plays a villain here and doesn't just voice a villain here like he did in the ""Star Wars"" series as Darth Vader and he was excellent in his role as Thulsa Doom. Arnold Schawarzenegger looked the part in both his physique and fighting skills. Was he perfect in terms of dialogue or acting? Probably not, but that's not entirely a bad thing being that a film of this calibre isn't intended to be dialogue-oriented. Arnold is backed by frequent Milius collaboator Gerry Lopez as Conan's friend Subotai, Mako as a mysterious wizard, Cassandra Gava as a seductive witch, Max von Sydow as King Osric and Sandahl Bergman as a master thief and later love interest of Conan's Valeria and you have a nice blend of veteran performers and relative unknowns performing together each delivering their respected lines and scenes harmoniously.And though the good outweighs the bad in ""Conan the Barbarian"", the movie itself does have its flaws. Though not as a fault of its own, the visuals have not aged very well. The giant snake confrontations were at times anticlimactic. The other supernataural and creature effects looked more lame than convincing. Even though Arnold was perfect for the role and his dialogue was limited like it should, his charcater lacked charisma (he did get better with his next fillm ""The Terminator"").If you're a Conan fan, you might like the Blu-ray features which offers great bonuses making it a collectors item. Such features include deleted scenes, commentary from Arnold and Milius and behind-the-scenes footage behind the making of the movie. In addition, we are also treated to the making behind the swords used in the movie with some of the greatest metal shop makers in the world and the person behind the scenes who trained the stars in the art of sword-fighting. A lot of these bonuses are featured on the Blu-ray HD. If you ever want to see it for yourselves I would recommend it.",Conan the Barbarian
66,pc95,"Excellent Music, Good Story, so-so Acting",6,30 November 2008,"Giving Conan the Barbarian a generous 6/10 mark mostly because of growing up in the 80s. Recently re-watched this early 80's saga especially enjoying the downright momentous music. However the acting really doesn't keep pace, and the fighting scenes are clumsily put together for the most part. Costuming is fairly well done, and the story does pretty well especially through the first hour and a half with the mixed in homages to various Gods and Barbarian Philosophy. And a Witch and Wizard thrown in for good measure. However, the movie suffers from a poor finale and final battle(s). (mild spoilers) Despite a fairly entertaining infiltration of Doom's stronghold with a strong set piece replete with cannibal-goulash, the director/producers run out of steam/ideas (budget? :) ) subsequently taking us next back to a tired Stonehenge-esquire setting with some unimaginative albeit gory fight scenes. Yes the gore is piled on gratuitously and shamelessly - too much surely. So as an Arnie fan, you better have watched this unless just starting out - it's requisite. A romp as far as music, but not nearly to the acting level as say Excalibur ('81). Nonetheless it's always pure fun listening to Arnie's dialog and Austrian accent. Worth a look for Nostalgia's sake and music.",Conan the Barbarian
67,MR_Heraclius,Conan,7,4 March 2020,"The movie that put Arnold on the map to becoming one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, The film itself is ok, Nothing brilliant but for its year it was pretty fun, Maybe not as fun as it should of been, It had some good and bloody action scenes and the effects were pretty good for its day, Just your typical revenge plot and it's not greatly acted, Arnold did ok but his main acting goal was to flex whenever the camera was on him, Although what's not to love about him knocking out a camel with one punch or biting off the neck of a vulture (Great stuff) It's a film that just about stands the test of time mainly due to the fact it's the film that created the legend Mr. Schwarzenegger.",Conan the Barbarian
68,Maciste_Brother,"Pretentious, bloated and boring. Nothing like the books",2,25 July 2009,"I saw this Dino De Laurentiis atrocity when it was released in theaters back in 1982. I was 15 years old. And was I ever disappointed by it. Nothing works in this film: the pace is slow and plodding; the story is almost non-existent; the action is badly edited and never catches fire; the music, as good as it is, is omnipresent and badly used; the acting...eh, what acting? The dialogue is hilarious with the voice-over being totally pointless; the look/design unimaginative and colorless; the whole production is uninspired and workman-like. Aside from the score, there isn't a single memorable thing in the whole film except when Conan punches the camel. That's it. And that scene was even repeated in the uber cheesy CONAN THE DESTROYER. But the biggest fault with this mostly forgettable film is the fact that it doesn't resemble Howard's creation for one second. It's a Conan film in name only. I couldn't believe how little it resembled the books. The story was basically changed to suit Arnold's personality. The cunning character of the novels replaced by the big lug-headed antics of a bodybuilder/wannabe actor.In the end, the bland film is many parts Italian Sword & Sandal films (lots of Peplum clichés), part THE PRODIGAL (the Lana Turner Biblical flick), part ponderous Spaghetti Western, part Texas Chainsaw Massacre (cannibalism, with body parts hanging), part philosophical/intellectual/spiritual masturbation (a crucified Conan, which resembles the crucifixion scene in the great Spaghetti Western DJANGO KILL), part whatever but rarely original as a whole. The score is good but changes gears so quickly and so often that the director obviously has no clue on how to use music to boost the film's action. During the orgy scene, we hear three different scores one after the other as if one was listening to different tracks off a record, totally detached to what's going on on screen. Even the sets are pointless: the film's main set-piece is the big staircase built on a mountain side that leads to...nothing. There's no castle, no fortress. Just a big stupid staircase that goes nowhere. It's almost as if they forgot to add the matte painting of the fortress in post-production. The fortress is supposed to be built within the mountain but visually as it is, it just looks stupid and cheap.There's very little dialogue in this film and what there is is hilarious. Here's an example: ""Why do you cry?"" ""He's Conan. Cimmerian. He don't cry. So I cry for him."" says the character with as much passion and conviction as someone buying a monthly bus pass.That's me on the floor laughing.The GILLIGAN'S ISLAND delivery of the dialogue belies the pretentious direction of Milius, who thinks he's doing APOCALYPSE NOW but ends up with something less solid than an average Roger Corman cheapie. Milius specifically said that he wanted to distance the character from as many fantasy elements of the books as possible because he, being a conservative, didn't care much for supernatural mumbo jumbo. Great choice for director who was responsible in bringing one of the greatest literary creations of fantasy to the big screen.No wonder they only made 2 Conan films. It was aborted from the start. They're supposed to do a reboot of the Conan character. Hopefully they will stay way clear of the Arnold films and focus on the actual pulpy novels but with the sad state of films/remakes these days, my hopes aren't high.",Conan the Barbarian
69,lamegabyte,Excerpt > Zamoraaaaaah *,10,1 February 2016,"We are again in the time of my teens around the years 87-89, so the period when I got to discover sex, to being aroused Don't get mistaken, it wasn't the sculptural body of Schwarzy that got me hard but rather his hot meeting with the brunette sorceress ! As the movie is really a door to another world, very rude and salvage, for sure, the intimate relationships are like this too, except that there wasn't any warming for that in the movie and that I couldn't fathom that then ! So Conan strolls a forest and his path leads him to a forest hut with a woman standing at the gate who beckons him As the night falls, he comes in and to get the informations he needs, the woman asks a payment in kind. What is totally upsetting and exciting is that this woman moans so terrifically and loudly that you can imagine she has an incredible orgasm. It gets all the more hot than she spells every word of data with long « Ah ». Actually, the scene doesn't show anything except that they are stuck in the missionary position and that this unbelievable sorceress squeezed Swarzy to get more sensations ! As quickly as this copulations begins, the woman changes into a demon and Swarzy punches her to the fire ! In a way, « the howling » has a bit the same scene : dark knight in the woods, sex with a bestial brunette Anyway, as my father taped the movie on a VHS, I kept watching it to get in the mood, even editing the audio and finally it was the best introduction to sexual education I could get : i could understand what it means and how to do it !",Conan the Barbarian
70,blott2319-1,"Embarrassing and offensive, why is this a famous film?",2,12 February 2021,"I've heard Conan the Barbarian talked about for practically my entire life, but never felt a strong urge to watch it since sword-and-sandals epics aren't exactly my cup of tea. I always more-or-less assumed it was a good movie because of the notoriety it has received in popular culture. Little did I realize this movie is terrible. Watching as Arnold Schwarzenegger stumbles his way through the early days of his acting career is almost as painful as watching him rape women. Needless to say, I was more than a little turned off by the treatment of all the women in this film (appalled might be a better word for it.) Even the one woman who gets an actual character to play is treated as one more way to elevate the hero. Her value is only shown in what she can do to help Conan.Perhaps all of this would be forgivable if there was a great plot or some exciting action, but Conan fails on those two points as well. The setup for a decent revenge plot is there in the opening (the one scene of the film that is actually well done,) but they don't have enough story to hold this together as the only plot happening throughout the whole film. Instead we go on a bunch of little side adventures which are pointless, just to fill time until the final confrontation. The fight scenes are completely bland, and look overly staged. It's kind of laughable how slow the characters move even when they aren't shown in slow motion. Basically nothing in Conan the Barbarian worked for me. It's a film that is about as exciting as a trip to the dentist, and I found it just as painful to sit through.",Conan the Barbarian
71,classicalsteve,Sort of Apocalypse Now meets Excalibur meets Red Dawn: John Milius' Militarized Take on Robert Howard's Conan,7,16 February 2015,"Robert E. Howard (1906-1936), writer of pulp genre fiction in the late 1920's to early 1930's, had a vision or dream of a Celtic-Barbarian warrior. Legend has it that in this dream and/or vision the warrior identified himself as Conan and confronted Howard, instructing him to write his stories. Howard, then looking for a new character, went to work, and created not only Conan, a hulking barbarian warrior, part of Howard's mythical Cimmerians, a race which is a cross between Celts, Vikings, and Visigoths, but also the mythical time in which he lived, called the Hyborean Age. The Hyborean Age is a cross between the Dark Ages and Antiquity. These Conan stories appeared in Weird Tales during a 4-year period and became Howard's most memorable and beloved creation, spawning the fantasy sub-genre known as Sword and Sorcery. After Howard's death in 1936, other writers would not only try their hand at Conan, such as L. Sprague de Camp, but rip-off characters would also appear on the fantasy literature landscape, such as Kane by Karl Edward Wagner.Fast-forward about 45 years after Howard's death. Universal released ""Conan: The Barbarian"", directed by John Milius and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, based on the original character created by Robert E. Howard. The film was produced in the wake of the successes of Star Wars and Excalibur when fantasy-genre films were in vogue. The resulting film is loosely based on several of Howard's original stories, although the slavery sequence towards the beginning is not the original history of the character. (He was a warrior in a Cimmerian tribe which went into demise, and he became a wanderer.) After having viewed this film on the new Blu-ray edition, I have to admit the original Conan film, for the most part, seems to uphold relatively well. The look of the film on Blu-ray is no less than spectacular. The best aspects of this film are the visuals which well-portray the Hyborean Age.In this version of Conan, which I don't believe exists in any of the original stories, the plot-thread is a revenge story. Conan is a pre-teen among a small tribe of warriors. They appear to live a relatively happy and carefree existence until they are ransacked by a group of blood-thirsty warriors sporting superior armor and inferior moral codes led by an evil wizard-warrior who has a fetish for snakes, Thulsa Doom. (Thulsa Doom is a Howard creation, but he appeared as an adversary of Kull, not Conan.) Thulsa Doom and his minions kill the men and women of the village, and enslave the children, who are taken to a remote compound where Conan grows up working on some kind of large mill, ""The Wheel of Pain"". Later, he becomes a gladiator-like warrior, engaged in combat entertainments. Eventually he escapes and becomes a thief, but decides to track down Thulsa Doom and his strange religious order in which snakes are worshiped. My favorite scene is one in which Conan, newly liberated, stumbles into a cavern of sorts and meets the figure who will become his ""god"", Crom, and there finds a sword.Some aspects of the Milius Conan do come off dated. The music is a bit cheesy in parts, although the low brass with bass drum accents well portray the brutal era as envisioned by Howard. Some of the acting is a bit ""funny"" although fantasy adventures set in mythical times don't always require the best acting. No question the stand-out of the production in the acting department is James Earl Jones as the main baddie of the film. The most memorable line of the film, ""Crush your enemies. See them driven before you. Hear the lamentations of their women,"" uttered by Conan towards the beginning still sounds funny come out of Schwarzenegger's mouth but somehow it kind of works. Its the most quoted line from the film.One of the striking aspects of this film, after having seen it for the first time in over 20 years, is that the violence is relatively head-turning. Even today, a lot of films are not quite as violent as this offering. In a few notable scenes, heads are hacked off in true Milius style. Although you could never make a case that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a great actor, he seems the perfect choice for the part. Conan is burly and brutal, and so there was no need for a character actor in the lead role. (Legend has it the producer, Dino de Laurentiis, initially refused Milius' first choice for the lead, Schwarzenegger. When Milius then suggested Dustin Hoffman, Laurentiis threw Milius out of his office but financed the film anyway.) The film more or less works on its own terms. Probably the saving force is the incredible acting of James Earl Jones which makes up for the weaknesses of some of the other talent. Also, the set designs are no less than spectacular. Violent but occasionally tender, I do think it does justice to Howard. He might have been put off that the storyline was not directly based on one of his stories, but I think he would have appreciated the landscape and the big muscles of Schwarzenegger.",Conan the Barbarian
72,vip_ebriega,"Cheesy fun, and lots of violence too.",6,13 May 2008,"My Take: Cheesy, comic book madness. Enjoyable enough.One of the most anticipated releases in 1982, CONAN THE BARBARIAN is a big-budget production by Dino DeLaurentiis, based on Robert E. Howard's works. Conan is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger in his first, real role (forget that so-called movie titled HERCULES IN NEW YORK, who even knows that exists?). The film is also directed by John Millius, who also co-wrote the screenplay along with Oliver Stone.CONAN has a certain amount of violence. Even by today's standards, the violence is still worthy of its R rating. What doesn't hold up, however, is its seriousness. The films takes itself seriously, with its story of vengeance and redemption, but now, it's quite campy and often unintentionally hilarious. Stil, CONAN can be entertaining. Fans will gobble it up (some even go far as to say it's the best adventure movie they've ever seen, but I won't go that far), but non-fans may find it quite enjoyable, with some action decent scenes as well as some strong and memorable ones.After his parents were mercilessly murdered by an evil ruler called Thulsa Doom (""This is CNN""'s James Earl Jones), young Conan was sent to a life of slave-hood, then he becomes a gladiator, than a warrior (Schwarzenegger) bent to avenge his parents death. On his side is a brave woman warrior named Valeria (Sandahl Bergman), a sidekick (Ben Davidson) and the famous wise wizard (Mako, in a familiar voice).The film doesn't hold up pretty well. What once was expensive, is now quite cheap and often cheesy. The giant snake that Conan does battle with is pretty cheesy, as with other special effects. The screenplay doesn't hold up pretty well either in terms of dialog. It's often filled with very cheesy lines, as if it were written by a rookie B-movie writer (but as a matter of fact, they were written by A-listers Milius and Wood). The film is also quite sexist. It's basically a man show, where the ladies (except the Valeria character) just stand aside while the men do all the fights and stuff. The woman on the other hand, are either damsels much in need of rescue, while others are sacrificial baits.But taken in the right spirit, CONAN THE BARBARIAN is still a worthy nostalgia. It's cheesy and often campy, but I like it for what it is. It is maybe perhaps that I am not a Conan fan. Conan fans will still surely get a real kick out this film. It's quite enjoyable, but it ain't for all tastes.Rating: *** out of 5.",Conan the Barbarian

Wow, talk about a plot heavy movie. Actually that's a good thing because Conan The Barbarian works because of it's business, due to it's popularity we were treated to very bad sword and sorcery movies in the 80's but this classic features everything you could want from the genre.

74,phubbs,Conan the Barbarian,5,12 February 2015,"The first film to get Arnie on the way to the man he is today, and the first of three very similar fantasy flicks. Based on a pulp comic character from the 30's this film franchise turned the idea on its head and into a cult spanning many different formats and influencing other fantasy films, it also helped some videogames along the way.The plot is simple, Conan is taken from his family who have been conveniently killed by a band of nasty warriors dressed in black. He is put into slavery and made to do hard labour for the rest of his foreseeable future. The torturous slavery makes Conan big and strong despite the apparent lack of decent food, nutrients, fishfingers or milk. He eventually is sold into gladiatorial fighting where he becomes a brilliant battler and swordsman and wins his freedom. From there on he's off to avenge his families death, as you do.Obvious premise but its an old film folks. Yes the film is old, back in 82 things were different, what you see now when watching is a horribly clichéd, predictable, hammy, semi cheap looking mess, but back then it was fresh...ish. All the bad guys wear black and look a bit camp with their wigs and handlebar moustaches, you wonder why exactly these groups of bad guys always attack and kill helpless useless peasants, what's in it for them? why they always leave one kid alive to grow up and take revenge on them?? and what is James Earl Jones character actually up to? what's his goal? his plans? why do all those people follow him? etc...Yeah I know I'm being picky, it matters not really, the film is old and all these barbarian films are pretty much the same, its all about the spectacle and fantasy right. This first film is definitely more adult than the rest, lots of blood splashing about with limbs being hacked off...good stuff. Yet despite that there isn't too much action really, more character development surprisingly and what action there is has some nice effects too, nice snake work and some nice animated spirits also.To be honest I've actually always preferred the original 'Beastmaster' film over Conan. There a few nice moments in this but really its pretty tepid, if only 'The Beastmaster' starred Arnie. And what the hell was that huge wheel thing Conan pushes for half his life suppose to be? a mill? a well? or merely for torture? a plan that backfired for Thulsa Doom methinks.In the end the final teasing image and narration about King Conan is actually far more interesting and intriguing than the film that preceded it.5/10",Conan the Barbarian
75,DarthBill,Arnold The Barbarian,10,29 March 2004,"The other film that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a star (before ""The Terminator"") casts him as Howard's barbarian Conan, unfairly enslaved as a child after his parents are murdered by James Earl Jones.

In addition to being used for breeding purposes, he makes sweet love to a freaky wolf witch and the lovely blond Sandahl Bergman (don't miss the then 31 year old Sandy stripped of her clothes so everyone can get a good look at her 5'10"" figure).Arnold is powerful and commanding in his silent, Terminator way, but also more fallible and strangely less invincible than some of his later characters (the ones who made jokes); don't miss Arnold brooding. James Earl Jones is a great villain, and Bergman's a great love interest. Too bad she didn't go on to better things.Plenty of blood and guts, great sets and props, some nice sex and a rousing score. Followed by the inferior though funny ""Conan The Destroyer"" in 1984 a few months prior to the Terminator's release. Special edition DVD has lost footage that actually helped develop Conan's character.

The most awesome tale in the universe. ""Conan what is best in life?"" To crush your enemies, see them driven before youetc"" Such a great movie, Arnie at his best, great lines! A must watch. This is the only true original movie of the 80's. Arnold Schwarzenegger was born as a star in this epic tale. I love this film and it is one of my favorite Schwarzenegger films, the same way I love the sequel Conan the Destroyer. I am sorry I hate the remake they gave this film a bad name. The remake was stupid film and boring with fake CGI's this film has none CGI. I grew up with this film, my first movie of the duelogy was Conan The Destroyer, I wanted to see this film so badly and I did. Weeks later it was on TV and I watch it. I always enjoyed this film and I still do. Terminator is Schwarzenegger's famous role, but Conan is also the same famous on his own way. Awesome movie and one of the best classic films from the 80's wasn't 1982 an amazing year for sci-fi and fantasy? That year was a fantastic memorable year for movies. I saw this when I was 6 on TV and thought it kicked ass and one of the films that made a fantasy fan. James Earl Jones as Thulsa Doom did a wonderful professional job as the villain in this adventure. The special effect creating a snake are wonderful and believable. Arnold Schwarzenegger with only few dialogues did a wonderful job performing of one of the best characters in cinema. John Milius as writer and Director did an excellent job as both directing this film and helping writing the script. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and special effects.Before CGI allowed filmmakers to cheaply create any fantasy world they can think of fantasy films had to rely on real locations, practical effects, and deep imagination to bring those worlds to life before the camera rather than in post-production. It may not be bestowed with Oscars, but Conan The Barbarian is just as classic as Ben Hur and more brutal than Gladiator (2000). Schwarzenegger makes his breakthrough performance as the titular character in search of barbarous vengeance. The Austrian champion bodybuilders acting career was off to a very slow start after The Terminator, but it wasn't until his role of the already-iconic Cimmerian slayer that his career suddenly catapulted his unique name to superstardom. And he's the perfect fit for bringing the heroic fantasy to the big screen. Though, Schwarzenegger didn't have the same acting experience as he does now, and he never really was the most dynamic actor in the world; Too much Schwarzenegger in any given movie doesn't necessarily mean a good thing given his range, he still brings unmistakable screen-personality, practically bursting at the seams with muscles and with his raspy brusque accent, and actually accomplishes more with his stares and expression than any of his dialogue could.Milius' film is loosely based on author Robert E. Howard's original ""Conan the Barbarian"" tales would be an understatement. Milius' Conan is a different creature entirely and shares little in common with Howard's Conan, or the personality, motivations, quick-thinking and charisma that have long defined the character on the page. Howard's Conan (and many later incarnations of the swordsman) is a cunning adventurer; as clever as he is powerful, as deadly as he is daring, as fierce as he is fearless. Milius' Conan, at least initially, is a lost puppy by comparison. A vicious, dangerous pup, mind you -- one that would just as soon rip out a man's throat as curl up beside him -- but still more of a wayward vagrant than a decisive, as-yet-unmatched warrior. His self-awareness, intelligence and authority evolve as the film plows ahead, no doubt. There just aren't many defining moments other than those our defiant hero stumbles into thanks to twists of fate and a bit of dumb luck. Both Milius' re-workings of Conan's origin and Schwarzenegger's casting take a toll.Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as the legendary warrior and hero, Conan the Barbarian. When his parents are killed by a band of brutal marauders and the gang's cold-blooded cult leader (James Earl Jones), the orphaned Conan endures a childhood of merciless slavery only to become a gladiator for the amusement of his captors. Eventually set free, Conan begins a dangerous, full-blooded quest to avenge his parents' massacre.

79,TheNorthernMonkee,one of Arnie's best in entertaining epic,6,13 May 2005,"SPOILERS Two years prior to ""Terminator"" and even more before ""Predator"", Arnold Schwarzenegger shot to fame as the blood thirst Conan the Barbarian. Slightly stretched at just over two hours, this film is one of the highlights of the early 1980s. Your regular heroes and villains tale, ""Conan the Barbarian"" is surprisingly obsessive. Once you get into the film, it's difficult to take your eyes off the screen.Raised as a slave, Conan (Schwarzenegger) is released with plans to revenge the death of his family by slaying Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). With friends Valeria (Sandahl Bergman), Subotai (Gerry Lopez) and The Wizard (Mako), Conan believes his God will give him vengeance.As an actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger has always been finest in the roles which require little speech. Whether as Conan or ""The Terminator"", Schwarzenegger has made a successful name for himself as a man of brute strength who keeps an emotionless face. In fact, it's perhaps the only role where he's been remotely decent. With that in mind, this film is one of his finer moments.The weird thing about Conan is it's obscure plot. Difficult to fully comprehend what exactly is going on, you grow to either love or hate it, but for some strange reason, you can never take your eyes off the screen.All in all, ""Conan the Barbarian"" is not the finest film you'll ever see, but the curiosity is it's obsessive nature. You put it on and irrelevant of how weak the film gets, you can't turn it off.",Conan the Barbarian
80,afonsobritofalves,The beginning of Arnold Schwarzenegger,7,17 September 2018,"One of the best classics of the 80's and one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best performences. It had fantastic special effects (taking the scenes of the giant snake), also had great actors, a fascinating and fantastic story, a good villain and a main main character, with a great mutation and a very good story. The only bad part of the movie is the fact that the film is too violent and have very unrealistic scenes for a movie that had everything to be and be good. I recommend it a lot.",Conan the Barbarian
81,rebeljenn,entertaining but weak story,4,9 July 2006,"'Conan the Barbarian' is a film about a young boy whose parents were killed by a cult; he is sold into slavery, and when he is free, he goes to track down the cult that destroyed his family. Along the way, he meets a couple of partners in his quest for revenge, including a young woman that he falls in love with. The film has many fantasy elements from wizards to giant-snake worshipping cults. The performances are done well, and the fantasy elements and special effects are good for their time; the story, however, is a little bit weak. The film is entertaining, but do not expect a classic. Rating: this film is just about average.",Conan the Barbarian
82,manitobaman81,Good,7,5 September 2014,"A brutally cool movie. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. There are fisticuffs back and forth. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do, however, drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. Arnold is a unique presence in American cinema and hopefully this is a sign that he will do more of these kinds of austere, gripping character pieces more often in the future. 7/10.",Conan the Barbarian
83,tomimt,Arnold's best,9,26 January 2005,"I love Conan the Barbarian. It is probably the best Arnold movie there is. Yes, you heard me, even better than Terminators or Predator. Many people speak about CtB like it was based on comic books. And by comic books they mean Marvel comics, which was the style of that god awful sequel Conan the Destroyer. Conan The Barbarian is more like Robert E. Howards short stories presented Conan. And he even wears different kind of outfits instead of prancing around in some silly Tarzanian loin cloth. Of course, this movie is not fully Howardian, but the feeling is there. And that is what matters.What else is good in this movie? Well, as I said the atmosphere. But the musics. Ah, the wonderful, pompous music, one of the greatest movie scores ever made.And actors. No, I won't claim here that Arnold would be brilliant as an actor. But he fits in Conan. He IS Conan. But there are good actors in this movie. James Earl Jones does excellent role as cult leader Thulsa Doom, probably most evil villain of movie history. And most captivating. Max Von Sydow does small, but important role as king Osric, who sends Conan to rescue his daughter form that grasp of Doom. Garry Lopez (Subotai) and Sandhal Bergamn (valeria) do great supporting roles as Conans rogue friends. And of course Mako, playing the role of unnamed wizard. Great parts, all of them.All this is crowned by John Milius's directing. Not brilliant in all places, but enthusiastic and energetic. Very fitting for this movie.I couldn't give this movie a full 10, because there are some scenes that feel a bit awkward, and not all the actors are that good. But the funny thing is, that even some of the actors are Arnold's bodybuilder buddies and hulking athletes, it doesn't matter. It's just their presence that is needed, not their communication skills. They don't have that much dialog, that it would bother the viewer. A wise decision.All in all, very good movie. Forth viewing for fantasy fans. And especially for Robert E. Howard fans. I think he would have been proud out of this movie.",Conan the Barbarian
84,Dan1863Sickles,More Grapes of Wrath than Star Wars,6,8 May 2021,"Like a lot of other reviewers, I had heard about this movie my entire life. My best buddy in the Marines quoted from it all the time. I assumed it was a classic, like The Wild Bunch. Last night I finally saw it after forty years.So much of this movie is boring, even silly. Yet it never feels fake. The characters talk all the time about what a hard life they have, how they are certain to die soon and nobody will remember them. The funny thing is, while the action is cheesy, the characters aren't. All of the actors, even Arnold, seem to project a lot of sadness and hard times. They aren't really fighting to be rich and have luxury, but just to stay alive another day.This really is a good movie in its own way. But the mood is closer to the Grapes of Wrath than Star Wars. Which would probably surprise John Milius, the director, because he was supposed to be a very right-wing guy.",Conan the Barbarian
85,dave13-1,Under-appreciated classic,7,15 April 2012,"When Conan came out in 1981, critics griped about its elephantine pacing and ponderous dialogue, and long stretches in which nothing much happened, giving evidence that they expected traditional action- adventure in the vein of, say, Sinbad. But director John Milius had set out to create something very different: an epic Aryan myth which translated the qualities of Wagnerian opera to cinema, and in large part he succeeded. Conan has a sweeping epic feel, and is heavily dependent upon and driven by its setting and music to a degree that is very rare. As important as the deeds of the legendary hero, which are shown in brief and violent spurts of action, are the place and the culture that shaped that legend. The journey that created the myth, in short, is equal to the myth itself, and this is the logic and justification for the setting-heavy approach taken by Milius. And Basil Poledouris' wonderful music, which starts out Wagnerian and brassy, but adds middle Eastern touches as Conan's journey takes him in that direction, tracks along with Conan to show up the breadth of his epic journey while celebrating his heroic achievements. Ultimately the story that gets told is somewhat less worthy of Milius' Wagnerian ambitions than are the music and the visuals, but the overall results more than justify the effort, especially when compared to the Italian sword and sandal knock-offs which followed this much copied but never equaled classic of the fantasy genre.",Conan the Barbarian
86,stevelomas-69401,Nostalgic 'Sword & Sorcery' from ano time,7,20 February 2021,"2 hours + of the 'mightily thewed' Arnold in something that Robert E Howard would've been proud of. Okay the film is slow, scripting basic and tropes of yesteryear but this is 'sword and sorcery' at it's best. It is not as one of my boys said, 'really good if it was a silent black & white film'!",Conan the Barbarian
87,dr_foreman,Star Wars for psychopaths?,10,23 February 2004,"At least, that's what one critic called ""Conan the Barbarian"" at the time of its release.It's easy to see why.  This movie is from the head-chopping, blood-fountaining, spiked-gauntlet-splatting-into-your-neck school of non-subtlety.   But it's also a masterpiece.  For whatever reason, I really prefer John Milius' vision of a fantasy world to that presented in ""Lord of the Rings"" by Peter Jackson.  Whereas ""Rings"" features grand storylines involving clashing armies, not to mention a dull Liv Tyler swooning on various Elven couches and professing her love for the nice man with the stubble, ""Conan"" eschews epic storytelling and focuses on a very personal quest for revenge. As Conan memorably says to Thulsa Doom, ""You killed my mother...you killed my father...you killed my people!  You took my father's swoooord!"" 
And he's gonna make James Earl Jones pay.So, will you dig it?  That depends.  Large portions of the film are silent, and the pacing is, by modern standards, rather slow.  However, Ron Cobb's production design is simply beautiful (The Mountain of Power in particular; they would never build something that cool for a movie today, would they?) and Basil Poledouris' music some of the most stirring ever recorded for a movie.  And, although Arnold is no Olivier, his screen presence is, as ever, magnetic.  The sword battles are well choreographed, the supporting cast is strong (Max Von Sydow does a memorably loopy turn as the king), and the viewing experience as a whole will effectively immerse you in a strange and savage land (if you let it, anyway!).  Probably the best fantasy movie ever made - even if you're not a psychopath.",Conan the Barbarian
88,Aylmer,any teenage boy's dearest friend & ally,8,28 May 2012,"As a youth I was introduced to Conan first with The Destroyer which is much friendlier and more accessible to juvenile audiences. When I first tried out the prequel around age 11 or 12 I found it just too ponderously slow-paced and straight-faced to really dive into (and the sex and violence put me off). However, come puberty and patience a few years later, everything changed as I developed an appreciation for slower, simpler, solid originals as opposed to faster-moving albeit sloppier sequels (like to a less extreme example ALIENS and TERMINATOR 2). Most importantly, I was of an age where I was finally able to appreciate the sophistication of the creative vision behind the scenes: the locations, the costumes, the performances, and best of all the music! Basil Poledouris never really got his day in court later in his career quite like he did with this film. It's one of the richest, most melodic, and consistently riveting and appropriate scores ever produced. At the time, it must have been a revelation. Every scene and every performance in the film (aside from Sydow, who has no music to his well-acted but somewhat sluggish talk scene) benefits from the musical score immeasurably.I don't think audiences today can quite see how ahead of its time this film was, or how much of an anomaly it stands as. It's the first serious-toned and realistically violent fantasy movie that was ever made, and maybe the only one to have such a depth in philosophical reasoning behind it and an adequate budget to realize most of what the filmmakers intended.Therefore it really is *the* fantasy movie of our time, something harder-edged and with more of the focus on the loner fighting his way to the top than something like the LORD OF THE RINGS movies which focus on a larger conflict with a team effort.In retrospect I'm bittersweetly happy to have had this film as a friend growing up as it did a lot to promote an interest and appreciation of cinema. It's actually quite key to why I work in the business today. Unfortunately though I've come to realize that the magic of films like this is largely gone from the movie industry today and we may never see films again so personally crafted in an age of economically-driven blockbusters. With a lot of hope and determination from today's generation of artist, that can change. A boy can dream.",Conan the Barbarian
89,bgar-80932,Felt too dated,5,22 January 2020,"I'm sure at the time when Xena and such were the popular fantasies to look up to this one was just as good if not better. That said the acting was pretty sub par. The adventure and story was alright, the music and cinematography was alright as well. Those things might have even been good for the time. Still Arnold was a bad actor, the dialogue was crap, and the action didn't look right. In fact the action looked downright silly at times. I watched it almost 40 years after it was made but some films from the 70s and 80s stand up and this one doesn't for me.",Conan the Barbarian
90,loganx-2,"""What is best in life""...",8,11 June 2008,"People always talk about this film as the mindless fantasy classic, but there's more going on here than meets the eye, at least I'd always thought so growing up. My suspicions were re-ignited when I realized Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay.There's plenty of sex and violence, but Conan's enemy inspired by Hassan I Sabbah(the old man in the mountain),and played oddly by James Ear Jones, spouts a philosophy of emptiness and the surrender of will and self, makes a perfect foil, to Conan's self made man individualism, and materialism. The res a very literal crucification and resurrection scene here as well, followed by the film's end in a kind of public diecide, as does the second film. It's a simple philosophy in Conan, but one well told enough that I still remember it and could pick up on it as a kid, no God, no magic, no King, no object or steel, is of any value at the end, just will and a zeal for life. It's easy to pick on any film staring the current Governor of California, but this was one that crystallized the grim, Sword And Sorcery genre, and there hasn't been a better film since. ""Kull The Conquerer"" ,""The Scorpian King"", ""Conan The Destroyer"", etc., maybe a one note genre for some, but for others this is as good as it gets",Conan the Barbarian
91,chaswe-28402,Comic book visual,9,23 February 2017,"There is no point in complaining that artworks don't succeed in being what they are not trying to be. A lot of people seem to want this picture to be what it isn't. It is in fact a very straightforward ""Bildungsroman"", and/or an ""Odyssey"", where the hero grows up and travels through many trials and tribulations towards his triumphant revenge. Just like Odysseus.Visually it's tremendously effective, and it certainly doesn't need special acting skills. The hero just has to grow up to look like a hero, and he sure does. All the stars in this movie have what it takes, and how. Arnold looks great --- yes, that's the word; and so does Sandahl, a Valkyrie personified; and the rest all fit perfectly. What's to knock, or dislike ? It's just a comic, or what these days they call a graphic novel. A tremendous coming-of-age. The baddies get truly thumped, just like that nosy camel. Luckily, I've never read anything by Howard.",Conan the Barbarian
92,Al_The_Strange,"""Let me tell you of the days of high adventure!""",9,22 March 2014,"Fantasy films are rarely bold in spirit. Most of them offer colorful, vivid spectacles in wonderful places, but when drawing on ancient myth and legend, very few truly recognize that our history is full of darkness and savagery. In the 1930s, Robert E. Howard created a legend of his own, channeling all the primal brutality and bloodshed of the ancient times into one savage hero: Conan, the Cimmerian who would become a warrior, a pirate, a conqueror, and eventually a king. Conan's adventures in literature took him across all corners of the ancient Earth, to battle countless enemies, vicious monsters, and the darkest magic. Films with this same rawness seem to only come once in a great while.1982's cinematic debut of Conan is a welcome break from the typical sugar-coated fantasy fare; the film doesn't hold back on showing brutal warfare, liberal bloodshed, rampant sex, and savage landscapes. Right from the beginning, the savagery is palpable. At the same time, the film is not all that trashy about it; is uses only as much blood and gore as it needs to to tell the story. Using only a light amount of excess, the film progresses through a lengthy adventure full of cool battles and memorable scenes, with the right pacing and an appropriate tone that's not too bleak but not too lightweight. As it is, this incarnation of Conan is fun and awesome to watch, and even after a sequel, remake, and video game, it hasn't been matched since.The original stories can get a bit derivative: Conan usually appears somewhere to slay some bad guys, get the girl, get the treasure, defeat evil, blah blah blah. This film ventures into the same formulaic territory, but before doing so, it lays the groundwork by chronicling Conan's origins, in a tragic opening sequence that's so fundamental in nature that it's been seen before. From then on, the film maintains a solid pathos that allows us to follow and root for Conan on his sprawling quest of vengeance. Conan is a fundamental hero to the core, and the film expresses all his characteristics - his strength, his beliefs, his motivations - aptly. The side characters he picks up are lovable, and their enemies are bad guys we love to hate. The plot is pieced together using some scenes inspired by the original stories, but it all flows really well, thanks mostly to the characters and their chemistry. It's all set in a world that looks primal, but not quite as dark or magical as the original stories.This film boasts some good-looking photography. It can be pretty murky and drab at times, but the camera angles are great and the imagery overall is solid. Editing has a few weak parts, but is still mostly good. Acting can be a bit silly, but Arnold Schwarzenegger fits Conan both in body and spirit. I love Sandahl Bergman's performance as Valeria. James Earl Jones is literally hypnotic as the main villain, and everybody else does okay. Writing has a few weak spots, but there are still quite a few good lines. This production uses some limited, but very real-looking and detailed sets, props, and costumes. Basil Poledoris' music score is epic, grand, and a thing of beauty in itself.Conan the Barbarian is one of the very few epic/fantasy films that's so raw and brutal, but it's still a fine adventure with lovable characters and solid plotting. Some may call this film overly violent or stupid, especially in the way it revels in savagery. But I've always valued the beauty of savagery, for I believe there is something compelling about the primal nature of this character. If you enjoy stuff like this - like the 300 series, the Berserk manga, the God of War video games - then Conan should be a must-see.On home video, the unrated cut of the movie includes a few bonus scenes that elaborate a bit more on the characters, but aren't really all that necessary for the plot.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Good)",Conan the Barbarian
93,bsinc,A classic adventure movie,9,1 March 2002,"This is one of the best adventure movies ever made, after The Indiana Jones series it's the first thing that pops into my head when I think of an adventure movie. A movie that relies on its visual and acustic elements (Basil Poledouris has really managed to compose one of the most memorable scores ever, as usual - Robocop, Starship Troopers) and makes the most of its rather ""empty"" script. When I first saw it a kid I didn't like it, but over the years I've come to truly appreciate this work of art, to say the least. An excellent two hour entertainment with a deep and powerful story. James Earl Jones is really funny looking; probably because I'm used to him being older, but the base is there non the less. A CLASSIC.     9/10",Conan the Barbarian

96,supertom-3,Great Sword And Sorcery Epic!,9,23 July 2004,"A cracking sword and sorcery yarn that has divided movie goer opinions since it's release. Some believing it's a beefy and shallow action movie, glossed up with big sets and fancy costumes. Others believing it is a truly eye popping visual feast of a film with hidden depth. The film was panned on its original release but since then has been something of a critical favourite. While the film is too murky and turgid at times, it is still engaging, despite needing to lighten up a touch, because this is based on a comic book after all. The film is fantastical but at the same time the film doesn't go quite as fantastical as the comic books did. This seems to be more based in reality but it still features a snake-man, giant snakes and witches.The film follows Conan from childhood when his parents are killed and follows him through his early years as a slave to adulthood when he becomes a fighter and a thief. What drives Conan is pure bloodthirsty revenge on the man who killed his parents(James Earl Jones) and he is constantly spurred on by the belief he is doing his god's (Krom the god of steel) will. Conan constantly interprets important moments as messages from Krom.This film is so visual. The dialogue is minimal and yet meaningful. This gives the film a great atmosphere and really brings to mind two other fantasy action movies I really love, Crying Freeman and Highlander. They are all very similar in style. They all have the same strengths, in that they are both great looking, have a lead character driven by a spirit guide, controlled by his beliefs and a sense of destiny and all three have similar romantic subplot, all told with visuals, and little dialogue. They are all also blessed with unique and rousing scores. It's all very mythical and philosophical in each, with love at first site important. It is the love of the women that drive the men to their goals. In Freeman Dacascos wants to break away from his controlled regime, and take back his life when his love gives him the will to do so. In Highlander McLeod wants to lead a mortal life, to love and grow old with someone, to be human. Conan wants a life after he takes his revenge. The greatness of their romantic story and the purely visual way it is told is that during the movie he says only 5 words to her,and they all come in their first meeting. The film should not get away with something like that, yet it works well. The twist in Conan is that his lover sacrifices herself for him and in effect once he has achieved his goal the film is left with the feeling Conan has no further purpose in life. The cast are good. Arnold was made into a star here. He is physically the best shape he's ever been in a movie. He is smaller than his bodybuilding days yet as big as he's ever been on screen and at the same time fleet of foot and nimble. Lest we not forget by the time he hit mega stardom he was in his 40's, but Arnold is truly in his prime here. It is a performance though of glaring inconsistency which is the likes of which I have never seen. It is at once his best and his worst performance. For all that Schwarzenegger does with a depth and humanity not seen in his films since, he overplays and looks amateurish in others, because of course he was an amateur here. What really does work is the chemistry between Sandahl Bergman and Schwarzy. She gets the best out of him and their scenes together are generally his best. Bergman received a Golden Globe for this and had Arnie consistently been as good as his higher points here, who knows? You get the feeling the philosophical side might occasionally have gone over his head. At times he would bawl out ""Kraaoomm!!!"" without knowing why he was delivering the line. Bergman is good. She is enigmatic and quite sexy in a ""why is she sexy?"" kind of a way. Bergman kicks ass and her dance background shows as she moves with grace. The showstoppers though are the supporting cast with the legend Mako, excellent as the wizard and narrator. Max Von Sydow is superb as king Osric and he gets some of the best dialogue but it is the chilling James Earl Jones who is particularly excellent as Thulsa Doom.What makes this film great is the fact that it feels older than it is. It feels like a b-movie fantasy film from the golden ages of the 50's and 60's, with some of the charming elements of the legendarily cheap Italian fantasy films. The film even at times feels like it is dubbed. While all it lacks is a stand out Ray Harryhausen moment. The nearest we get is the giant snake. I would have loved to have seen more creatures and beasts in this movie with some HarryHausen effects but it come a tad too late really. Also Basil Poledouris' score is fantastic and old fashioned a big reason the film feels like it is from the golden age of this sword and sorcery quest movies. The score is the real standout part of the movie. It's very old fashioned, medieval and a bit baroque and works marvellously well with some rousing themes.The film is directed with visual flourish by John Milius, whose tragically lame career since makes you wonder what happened. In that sense it has another similarity with Highlander as the even more talented Russell Mulcahy was never matched the quality or success of Highlander since. This is a top notch film that fantasy enthusiasts will love. ****",Conan the Barbarian
97,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,10,4 April 2005,"Before Arnie became The Terminator he was Conan the Barbarian in this visually stunning fantasy film based on the books of Robert E. Howard. An endlessly influential film, withe recent films such as the Matrix and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy taking elements from it, a film with much greater depth than most give it credit for, clever, emotive, with a smart script, one of the best soundtracks of all time, strong performances and great action. Conan the Barbarian is an underrated classic, but one which all Arnie fans love, one which deserves to be recognised for what it is rather than criticising it as brainless violence.John Milius, director of Big Wednesday, writer of the Apocalypse Now screenplay and famous sections of Jaws and Dirty Harry decided to turn Howard's classic stories into a big screen adventure. With a script by himself and Oliver Stone, they found Schwarzenegger, convinced actors such as Max Von Sydow and James Earl Jones to join the cast, and made the definitive fantasy film. Along with Basil Poledouris making the score, and a host of talented set designers and effects guys, Conan the Barbarian should not be taken lightly.Conan tells the story of a man whose entire village was slaughtered when he was a child, and taken into slavery until he became an adult. During the period of slavery he pushes a giant wheel until he has grown, become strong, and everyone else has died. He is then taken and trained as a fighter and killer in small arenas, soon becoming the famous and bloodthirsty warrior in the land, forgetting his past, and becoming an emotionless machine. However, when he is released his past soon comes back to him and he seeks vengeance for the man who killed his family-Thulsa Doom. On his travels he rescues Subotai, played by surfer Gerry Lopez, a thief and they become friends. Soon they encounter Valeria, a beautiful young warrior thief who is infiltrating an evil tower owned by Doom. They go in, butcher the bad guys, steal a diamond, and Conan and Valeria fall in love. Her attitude towards life overpowers him, and the three go around the land stealing. However, the draw of the past is too much and they search for Doom who is taking over the land with his hypnotic powers, believing flesh to be stronger than steal. He is a powerful wizard and sacrifices many innocent young people who succumb to his ways, much like a modern religious cult. Doom and Conan meet again, and Doom is too strong, teaching Conan about his power, much like Conan's father spoke of the riddle of steel. Conan is left for dead, but his friends find him, and with the help of a magician restore him in a very touching and powerful scene. Renewed, Conan once more seeks Doom, but this time it is not him who is killed, enraging him further.Arnold's performance here is one of his best, the kind of role he should be given and proving that he is the best at what he does. Sydow is good in a smaller part, Jones is awesome-just watch his eyes. Mako is very good as the Wizard, Gerry Lopez is superb, and Sandahl Bergman is excellent in a performance which should have sent her on to greatness. The score is easily among the best ever, perfectly complementing every scene, heightening the emotional impact whether it be a battle scene or funeral. The action is also very impressive, before masses of CG beasties, with heads sailing off and swords clashing. It is also one of the most beautifully shot films of the decade, the camera panning over wide areas much like Kurosawa in movement, a technique used again by Peter Jackson. The script is full of quotable dialogue, mixing serious ones with typical Arnie one-liners, Nietchze is referenced and other philosophical issues are discussed with an odd amount of skill for an action movie. Rather than discussion, a few one-liners are given, but they are to good effect. Certain scenes are highly emotional, and they are dealt with skilfully, and Conan is a tragic figure rather than a murderer. No-one can ever get close to him again, anyone who does dies. It is not only a great action and fantasy film, but a great love story. Worthy of Oscar nominations, but of course this type of film is always regarded as pointless. Even if you are not an Arnie film, if you are not someone with a closed mind who has made a decision as to whether you will like a film or not before you see it, then you should see the many merits here. One of the best films of the early 80's, though unfortunately it is mostly discarded.10 out of 10",Conan the Barbarian

The supporting cast, including Max Von Sydow are wonderful.The music and sets are stirring and effective. The story is a simple one, but it is done very well.

99,OttoVonB,"The Austrian, Darth Vader and the Plastic Snake",10,17 October 2006,"From the famed comics, distilled through a cocaine fueled Oliver Stone's wild mind, comes Conan (Arnie), sole survivor of a village massacred by the evil Thulsa (James Earl Jones), he roams the land until he can exact his revenge.Sometimes, there comes a film that truly is a product of its time and place. Conan could only have been made by John Milius, with Schwarzennegger (who else could conceivably be physically credible?) and in the middle of the Raegan 80s. It is loud, violent, proud and it gloriously wears its campness as a badge of honor. In fact, rather than hide what in any other film would be construed as flaws, it places an emphasis on them to the point of turning them into unique strengths. It may have an Austrain and linguistically challenged colossus for a star, shamelessly use the voice of Darth Vader as its villain and have a plastic snake that wouldn't look out of place in a Monty Python skit, ""Conan the Barbarian"" is unbelievably endearing and enduring. This is mostly because, rather that inject the proceedings with irony, director John Millius chose to play it with a straight face.Conan is more than a product of its time and a one-off curiosity however. It is an important milestone of fantasy film-making, with influential strengths. First and foremost, the music score, by Basil Poledouris still dominates the genre with its unique blend of sensuality and violence. These two themes imbue the film completely, the first through fascination with carnality and human bodies, the second in the film's numerous groundbreaking brawls. Undilluted Schwarzenegger is something to look forward to. Undilluted Schwarzenegger wielding a gigantic sword in a fantasy world is a sheer joy (especially when he can is given the opportunity to kill vultures with his bare teeth while crucified).In these times of political correctness, CGI and sanitized entertainment, it is likely we shall never see its like again. We don't need to. Conan is immortal.",Conan the Barbarian
100,OMTR,Royal,10,1 February 2020,"This 1982's adaptation of Robert E. Howard's stories, written by Oliver Stone and directed by John Milius, benefits from a legendary casting: Arnold Schwarzenegger, James Earl Jones, Max Von Sydow, Basil Poledouris' best soundtrack ever and is masterfully edited.

101,CelluloidRehab,A Classic and the Best of Schwarzenegger !!,10,18 July 2004,"I have a soft spot in my heart for this movie, being that this is one of the first movies I can remember seeing. As I grew up I never stopped enjoying this movie and could come away with something new every time I watched it (now around 50+ times). The movie is multi-layered. On one level there is the action (which is very graphic). There is also philosophical layer (why am i here ?? that which doesn't kill you....). Mix that in with some wonderful cinematography (filmed in Spain) and very appropriately accompanied by dark, serious, foreboding music (by Basil Poledouris - who also did the music for Hunt for Red October) and you get the ultimate action movie (that is more than just an action movie - its the thinking man's action movie). Conan is based on the work of Robert E. Howard. Howard once described writing the Conan stories (which were published in Weird Tales) as this : At sunset, he could feel the presence of Conan coming into his room, looming over him and compelling or forcing him to write the stories. The movie captures the spirit of Conan, as portrayed in the stories. He is one who has lived a harsh existence, yet endures. He has been everything from a barbarian, to a swashbuckler, to a soldier, to a thief, to a general and eventually to even king. He is considered a barbarian by all the people he meets, include those considered to be ""civilized"". Conan plays by his own rules and morals. Even though he kills, he does so in much the same way a tiger eats its prey. At the same time, he displays more humanity, mercy and honor than most of the civilized world. This movie is perfect in the above respects. John Milius (the director and co-writer) does an excellent job along with Oliver Stone (co-writer) in getting the feel of the stories into the movie world. Schwarzenegger is cast perfectly in the role of Conan. I don't think anyone else would have been able to pull it off as well as he could have and still kept the role in the way it was meant to be. Conan does not say much, but when he does you better listen because it is important. Along with Schwarzenegger, the rest of the cast does a brilliant job to support the story. James Earl Jones is wickedly evil and Mako is perfect as the reluctant sorcerer. There are so many wonderful scenes that stick out in my mind. So many in fact that you should go out and see the movie for yourself (make sure you get the special edition DVD since it has extra footage and a great making of with all the cast including Schwarzenegger). By far my two favorite scenes/sequences of the movie are : 1) Prior to the battle in the desert, Conan says a little prayer to his god, Crom. This prayer embodies everything that Conan stands for. WHAT A PRAYER !!!. 2) The sequence thats starts from Conan's return to the Tower of Power to confront Thulsa Doom all the way to the end. It is wrought with meaning and some great cinematography. This movie is an absolute must see. 10/10-Celluloid Rehab",Conan the Barbarian
102,flingebunt,By Crom this is not too bad a movie,6,23 May 2005,"If the big guy Arnnie Burger had not made the Terminator movies, he would have been for all time been defined by his role as Conan the Barbarian. Instead of the Governator, he would be know as Conan the Governor.The story is simple. Orphan boy, raised as a slave, taught to fight by the best so he can compete in the arena of death, escapes and using his huge muscles and an even bigger sword, he seeks out the killer of his family.Set beautifully in an only slightly mythic past in the near east where Western, middle eastern and far eastern cultures come together is many strange and interesting ways.By keeping true to the original Conan books the story is possibly the only sword and sorcery movie that has any real depth. It's main problem is that the story waivers at the end in it's attempt to have a Apocalypse now style confrontation between Conan and Thulsa Doom.Just one question for you gentle reader, do you want to live forever, well do you punk! (It is a pity they didn't offer the role of Conan to Clint Eastwood).",Conan the Barbarian
103,Mcduff3601,Holds up after all this time - a fun action flick,8,2 September 2021,"If you like Arnie in his other rolls this one is a bit different. Instead of guns and explosions, this one is swords and snakes!This is a simple action movie, and the graphics are a bit dated but over all very entertaining. Conan is introduced, bad guys are introduced, Conan gets some friends and has a stand off with the bad guys. A good vs bad situation but fun to watch how it plays out.The pacing is a bit slow in spots as it introduces the mythology and the characters. The action tapers off a bit and feels almost like a drama nearer the end. If you want to watch Arnie in his prime hacking and slashing then I would recommend this one.",Conan the Barbarian
104,Thrashman88,Mediocre at best!,5,17 December 2007,"I saw CONAN when it was released, over twenty something years ago. I was 14 or 15 years old and I remember being a bit disappointed. I couldn't remember the whole movie, but I did remember that it wasn't as good as it was supposed to be and it was a box-office flop. Remember that when you're younger, it is easier for a movie or certain music to make an impact on you. Sometimes that impact holds true when you're all grown up, sometimes it doesn't. And sometimes it can be the other way around. So I decided to give CONAN one more chance by buying it in DVD and watching it and hearing it in all its glory on a LCD flat-screen with a loud and proud home theater.The result? ....The movie is STILL a turkey. No, it's not because of Arnold's stiff acting. In fact, I think his kind of early acting never suited him best as in this picture. He was, after all, a barbarian, so it would have been odd to see a more skilled actor doing CONAN. So in this respect, the movie is a winner with Arnold as the hulking, Neanderthal barbarian. It's the story that doesn't hold any water. What could have been an epic revenge tale was rendered poorly, with alarmingly very few action sequences. Had those action sequences been replaced by interesting plot and character development, then I'd probably wouldn't be whining. The best sword and sorcery movie of the 80's??? Gimme a break! Excalibur, which came a year earlier was better executed and miles and miles more interesting than this. True, production values are high on CONAN THE BARBARIAN. Basil Poledouris score is richly symphonic, yet he doesn't manage to write a memorable theme for CONAN. I mean, how many of you remember the movie's main theme. Poledouris' talents were vastly unfruitful. As a funny note, Jerry Goldsmith's main theme for TOTAL RECALL is very similar to CONAN's. At least, the first bars of the CONAN theme are almost exactly the same as those in TOTAL RECALL. As for the bad guy in the movie, Thulsa Doom (portrayed by Darth Vader himself, James Earl Jones), he starts off as some sort of Genghis Khan, pillaging villages in his path and ends as some sort of cult leader, like some sort of prehistoric Charles Manson. We are never given an explanation as to why he became a cult leader. It is for us to assume that he found immortality through this cult (worshipping snakes). And that, ""I'm your father"" crap at the end was so totally lame I almost turned the DVD off! The very few action sequences (like the ambush scene near the end) are edited in a very odd way, rendering them untense and pointless. I give the movie five stars because:1 - There's some good T&A in the movie, although limited. 2 - Sandhal Bergman looks hot. 3 - Arnold was totally the right guy to play CONAN. 4 - The cinematography is awe inspiring 5 - Basil Poledouris music rulz. May his soul rest in peace.Other than that, CONAN THE BARBARIAN is a rather boring affair, with little action, a poor story and not even enough bloodshed to make up for other things. Maybe this one really needs a remake!",Conan the Barbarian
105,mhasheider,"A sharp, unique, and well-crafted adventure.",9,13 October 2007,"A very ambitious and serious take on the stories by R.E. Howard and the adaptation turns out better than one would expect.""Conan the Barbarian"" follows the long and difficult journey of Conan who seeks revenge for the savage massacre of the people in his village - including his parents and the theft of a sword that Conan's father took his time in creating.Arnold Schwarzenegger (in one of the few roles) that made him a star portrays Conan who doesn't say a whole lot but makes up for it with simply being honest. Throughout the movie, Conan picks up a few friends (Sandahl Bergman, Gerry Lopez, and Mako) in his quest to find the one person who led the attack on Conan's village, Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), a cult leader who has a large legion of followers. Conan and his quartet certainly have their share of adventures that are nothing short of seriously intense.The director, John Milius (who was the right choice to direct this movie) co-wrote the script with Oliver Stone and here, Milius lets the film go at a steady pace and the battle sequences are well done instead of being too violent and careless. Also, another issue of note, the movie's handling of the characters and humor is treated with care and going way over the top.The performances by the cast in the movie are very respectable here and Milius' direction is excellent. If there's one thing that I can't forget bringing up in the review here, it's the magnificent musical score composed by the late Basil Poledouris. The music itself in the battle scenes reminded me of Elmer Bernstein's best composed work (""The Magnificent Seven"", ""The Great Escape""). For me, you don't hear composed music like this these days (and if there's a few noteworthy examples, then please forgive me).A sharp, unique, and well-crafted adventure.",Conan the Barbarian

110,antagonist117,A serious and not-for-everyone stab at the sword-and-sorcery genre,8,12 September 2014,"Long ago, in the distant time before ""The Lord of the Rings"" (well, before Peter Jackson's LOTR, not before the books or the earliest adaptations), before ""Thor"" (before the modern movies, I mean; not before the ""Thor"" comic character, which itself came long after the ""Conan"" pulp character), before ""Skyrim"" (OK, it was unequivocally before that), there was ""Conan the Barbarian!"" It would be wrong to say that ""Conan"" was the progenitor of anything other than Arnold Schwarzenegger's film career; the origins, influences, and manifestations of the major sword-and-sorcery franchises are complex and mostly separate from one another, hearkening back to and appropriating for their own purposes centuries-old, half-imagined stories and traditions that at this point in history belong equally to all.In the case of ""Conan,"" the milieu is the fuzzy line between West and East in the age of Genghis Khan's Eurasia-spanning empire, imagined here as a world of tribalism and ritualism. ""Conan""'s immediate textual source is itself, a cartoon from a 25-cent cult magazine. Director/writer John Milius, however, infuses his adaptation with overtones from the ostensibly more serious traditions of sword-and-sandal films and quests films: it is difficult not to think of ""Spartacus"" (1960) during ""Conan""'s first half hour, which sees the hero go from slave to pit fighter to outlaw iconoclast, and hard to miss the connection to ""The Searchers"" (1956) at the end. Milius, who also wrote ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), takes Conan's made-for-action-figure characters and genre trappings seriously in a way that not every filmmaker might have, and his commitment keeps it from becoming too campy. It is not a cheap production: attractive Spanish shooting locales, titanic sets with a sense of weight, endless detailed costumes, and thoughtful iconography elevate the basic storyline, as does an enthralling score by film composer Basil Poledouris. In all production categories ""Conan"" outperforms its near-contemporary, the noble but spectacular failure ""Excalibur"" (1981). ""Conan""'s supporting cast also stacks up well with the inclusion of Max von Sydow and James Earl Jones, two actors who are constitutionally incapable of bringing anything other than gravitas to a role. But the most surprising of ""Conan""'s achievements is its female lead Valeria, played by Sandahl Bergman. Her skill and capability are unqualified, and in a movie that is not always judicious in its depictions of women, her equal and at times grander stature to Conan's is a relief.However, the element that most sets ""Conan"" apart from later and earlier examples of its genre is its well-earned R rating. Today, studios that make their shareholders happy by dint of teen and preteen ticket sales do not allow their blockbusters to cross that line, so movies of this ilk today are often bloodless and sexless affairs. That is not to say that they are not violent and frequently sexist: they merely code their violence and objectification of women in ways that modern censors (MPAA reviewers) are either too dim or too hypocritical to acknowledge. The downside of ""Conan""'s show-it-all approach to sex and violence is that it is occasionally degrading and often excessive. Yet there is something to be said for the principle of taking off the reins and making a film that is proudly not meant for all audiences: something few fantasy movies today have the courage—or, yes, the naivety—to attempt.",Conan the Barbarian

(No, I haven't seen 'Stay Hungry' yet.) Part of me always wishes he had simply stuck to these films (as well as the 'Terminator' series), and was still making them.

WARRIOR. GLADIATOR. KING. This is the big one, the most recommended sword/sorcery movie. This created that sub-genres boom in the 80s for being pretty successful at the box office. Based on Robert E. Howard's most famous character, the film follows the most famous sword/sorcery character Conan as a child he watches his family get slaughtered right before his eyes. Young Conan is taken and enslaved until he is disbanded to learn how to become a killing machine. Conan becomes a thief with his new companions Subotai and Valeria. After having stolen from a serpent group, the king asks them to rescue his daughter the princess. Now Conan and his companions must use there skills to rescue the princess and put an end to Thulsa Doom. The film has very little dialogue which amplifies the performance of each actor on screen. Apparently not only did Arnold get acting tips from James Earl Jones but he also had to slim down a little for those awesome moments when he would have to spin the sword around. Max Von Sydo who plays the king Osric wanted to take on the role for his son who is a huge fan of the comics and he thought it would be a lot of fun. Sandahl Bergman who plays Valeria was a professional dancer had to learn how to do all her own stunts in the film nearly losing a finger in the process. Gerry Lopez was a good friend of the directors and John thought he would be good for the part after a screen test. Mako plays the Wizard and is the narrator, this dude well hes just awesome. The effects in this mostly still hold aside from the obvious blue screen in the opening of the film. We can assume that is why the director chose to go low-key on the fantasy element. That way he wouldn't have to rely on too many effects. The best effect in the film however is the giant snake in the temple of doom. Basil Poledouris the composer of the film had composed two hours of music being attached very early on. The director had envisioned this film with very little dialogue. Its a fantastic score that keeps you in tune with the film. They made it production wise as a very believable world as if this might have happened long ago. I wasn't really disappointed at the fact that there is no big battle between Conan and Doom because throughout the film I knew that most memorable thing about this film would be its performances, music, direction and overall story. This is a grand epic tale. Conan The Barbarian is one of the greatest fantasy epics but I choose to see it as more dramatic adventure film than anything else.

At best, I'd say it's a mediocre film. There is a certain element of cheese and '80s quality to it that keeps it fairly watchable, mostly due to Arnold Schwarzenegger's wooden performance and line deliveries. The music score and high production values are a plus, but that's about it for all of the positives.The story itself is not that compelling. James Earl Jones as the villain is just a standard bad guy who mostly does fixed stares. There's a lot of meandering that slows the film down which doesn't justify the runtime. The small handful of action sequences it does have are some of the best scenes, but there's not enough of them. In the end, it's filled with many Fantasy Cliches and any alright moments is not enough to save it in the long run.5/10.",Conan the Barbarian
116,JaydoDre,A big gorgeous vulgar jewel of a movie,8,22 January 2015,"Conan the Brabarian is a film where the bad is quite bad and the good is really good.The acting ranges between heaven and hell. It is Arnold in the main role, and not just any Arnold but a relatively early Arnold, so his acting leaves much to be desired, his charm notwithstanding. He is not the worst however. Some actors got even poorer and more poorly dubbed lines attached to them. The boy at the beginning of the film does not say anything at all, just stares all confused, even when his most beloved ones die. Someone forgot to tell this kid to begin acting.However, this movie does the smart thing by limiting the amount of dialogue for those who cannot act and saving the speeches for those who can: James Earl Jones, Max von Sydow and Mako Iwamatsu.Now we come to the most painful part of the film. The writing can be pretty good but there is a lot in this movie that either does not make much sense, is unintentionally funny or just plain stupid. Quite a few scenes, although have a point and purpose to them, contain nonsensical events. Conan wraps a fur around a naked woman but then immediately takes it off. Then for some reason he decides that a random dead guy in a cave is his God. A woman helps him only to immediately try and kill him. And the dialogueoh dear. The creators actually try to make the phrase ""You wanna live forever?"" a catch phrase for one of the characters. Stupid dialogue contrasts strongly with some really good lines from James Jones' villain, Thulsa Doom.There are a number of things about the story that are good. There is more to this movie than just a collection of action scenes. There is a theme about the power of mind body versus the power of weapons and about blindly following leaders. The story is not too formulaic. For example although the movie does have a romantic interest for Conan, she does not start like a typical lady character and does not play out like one. And despite the odd writing for certain scenes and dialogue there is an overall structure to the story that makes sense and flows well.The art in this film is epic and it is what defines this film. Misty forests, snowy mountains, deserts and huge sets combined with some of the best costume design create an unforgettable looking film. Those outfits are really something with the big fur mixed with leather, Nordic runes and Arnold's glistening muscles. A lot of these costumes look like one of a kind and it seems that Conan himself carries a whole wardrobe because he is in something new every day.The weapons can get a chapter of their own. They are important to the story so care was taken with their appearance. Conan's sword has become a recognizable icon, but there are also various Asian fist blades and bows.The best thing however that really makes this film for me is its music. There may be a little too much of it. It cannot help itself but play over everything, pumping on and on, but it can stay as long as it wants as far as I am concerned. String section, French Horns, piercing trumpets and the everlasting heavy thundering base drums come together to make this film feel truly epic. The main theme for this movie ended up on my mp3 player, then in my custom soundtrack for Elder Scrolls Morrowind and the subsequent Elder Scrolls games. When those drums start roaring, I know right away where I am - in the far away steppes, with the wind on my left shoulder and my sword on my right shoulder.Despite its flaws Conan the Babarian is one of my favorite movies of all time. The things that are bad about it are entertainingly bad and the entertaining things are properly entertaining. As soon as you start buckling under the poor dialogue, the movie throws a great looking scenery with an epic theme at you and sucks you right back on board. It is largely about the adventure atmosphere brought on by the great looks and music. This movie could have easily been a really bad adventure film, but it ended up in the right hands and it shines. It has so much character. It is an eternal dragon breathing fire. I am in awe of this movie's art and feel of adventure.Please be aware that while there may be women who will like this, at its core this is a very male-oriented movie. Those biceps are not flexing for the ladies. This is a power-fantasy movie through and through, power-porn if you will.",Conan the Barbarian

It divides itself between philosophical statement on the will and blood and guts epic, and does neither very well. Interlaced between this mish-mash of awfulness, is a revenge quest. This leads to another problem, which is that Schwarzenegger's character, in the beginning aiming towards depth, comes up one-dimensional and shallow in the end. The part where he exchanges ideas with Thulsa Doom does nothing to change his mindset in any meaningful way. I've heard one person on YouTube even comment that this is nothing more than ""just a Nietzsche movie."" Anyone who has had college-level philosophy will understand the comparison. The viewer is left confused, as the philosophical rantings seem to be placed there merely as a McGuffin to confuse and disorient the viewer. Anyone who has seen Pumping Iron will understand that this is a Schwarzenegger-being-Schwarzenegger movie, with very little depth to it. There are parts of this that just seem to be aimed at grossing the audience out. The parts with the snakes are one such part.

Conan the Barbarian was about the life of Conan but it was a montage of Conan and Kull stories. Thulsa Doom, after all, was Kull's enemy and not Conan's. The same with the serpent men. Conan never fought them. Conan's fights however, were with men, and in some stories, vampires. Arnold Schwarzaneggar was chosen as Conan despite the fact that he looks nothing like the character that was created by Robert E. Howard in the 1930s. Or should I say reinvented? Conan was the reinvention of an earlier character named King Kull. Both Conan and Kull share the same backgrounds. They were both barbarians and they both became king by usurping a throne. So why didn't Universal make more Conan movies with Arnold? I don't know.",Conan the Barbarian
124,kenstallings-65346,Both a victim and benefactor of timing,9,3 May 2021,"Conan the Barbarian set in motion a series of fantasy sword movies, and because it pioneered them, it both benefitted and suffered for its timing.Hollywood producers in 1982 were aghast at the violence, and required it be toned down. The result was a loss of realism in the final film.It benefitted from the freewheeling era of the early 1980's in that the sexuality and nudity could be starkly revealing, and therefore makes the movie superior to the more titillating fare offered in Conan the Destroyer.The result is a move that has lasted far longer than the wave of derisive reviews that corresponded to its initial release. It also remains far more commercially successful than any of its follow-on productions.In terms of the straight on barbarity of the movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger found the perfect vehicle to launch his mega movie career. His often clumsy dialogue, and inability to play nuance, was a perfect match for a character who was denied all forms of personal development beyond violence and brutality. Conan was a man of a violent age, barely beyond animalistic, and it required just the brutal character that Schwarzenegger could deliver better than anyone else of his time.What little character development took place likewise fit into the actor's undeveloped range, and it called for him to be clumsy in the effort. So, his emerging debonair efforts with Sandahl Bergman's Valaria, offered a humorous take that could only have happened if the character lacked in social charms.The score is both memorable and on point, and combines with the cinematography to produce a superior result. The special effects for the era were advanced, and yet were weaved into the narrative with such editorial skill, that the dated period results continue to work well.The sum of the movie is a period piece that transcends well beyond its original release date. Elements remain very much in vogue decades later and the movie will certainly endure well beyond the mortality of those who produced and acted in it.",Conan the Barbarian
125,maxmages,this movie is awesome,8,17 October 2017,So the film really surprised me. Large parts of the film come out completely without words one understands nevertheless all the Derby is not really great but very fast to savvy and very linear. The fights are really good that is a really classy male film but nevertheless all the women that can be found in there so also strike all SWJ and the the claim there are no strong women characters should necessarily look at this movie here and listen to the music the best I have ever heard in my life.,Conan the Barbarian
126,Filmdokter,Much better than you would expect,8,15 April 2021,"When you look at it's poster, you would think Conan The Barbarian is another 80's Arnie action film. But look closely to it's credits, because this film is written by John Milius and Oliver Stone. And it shows. Because this film is less about action and more about atmosphere and subtext concerning peace and war. The location and sets are absolutely stunning. These days they would just CGI an entire village but back then it was done for real and with the help of some practical effects. It's a beautiful and atmospheric film that is also quite brutal. And Arnie is great and pitch perfect in his breakthrough role. This is the most barbaric you'll ever see him. He rapes, calls women dirty names, kills a vulture with his teeth and punches a camel....and laughs while doing it.",Conan the Barbarian
127,fearfulofspiders,Very Good Sword and Sorcery Film...,7,28 August 2008,"Conan the Barbarian is so over-the-top, that it's actually a very good sword and sorcery film. It lives up to the title in that this is one barbaric movie. Several scenes can make one laugh, be it when Conan is tethered to the Tree of Woe and kills a vulture with his own mouth, or the other various acts of pure brute strength of the main character. The dialogue is so barbaric as well that some lines will stick with you for a long time, if not for ever.The acting is okay. Conan has very little dialogue, and whenever he does speak it ends up being slightly bad. James Earl Jones is probably the only person in this film, as well as Max von Sydow, who give genuine performances. Everyone else is just awful -- which kind of adds to the film in its own weird sort of way.The music by Basil Poledouris is stunning. It's very loud and subtle. The action cues alone make it well worth the money to buy if you have the opportunity, or are into orchestral music.An R-rating is very fitting for Conan the Barbarian. There's a ton of blood, though not a gory film -- with guts or insides spewed all over the place. There's also a lot of nudity as well -- you do see Conan have some lovey dovey time a few times.Overall, Conan the Barbarian is a fun movie. It's very '80s and it's very macho. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves fantasy -- such as me -- or is looking for a good film to enjoy.",Conan the Barbarian

The movie does display a bit of derring do...John Milius caught hell for casting James Earl Jones as Thulsa...and he does a credible dramatic job...though there are NO other blacks anywhere in the film . This was also one of the first films I can recall where a female character was able to carry her own in a swashbuckling, sword-clanging sense. But, for me, the film was a very difficult watch. I guess I was disappointed at the translation from the books to the film...it just wasn't the same, somehow. There's enough action...and enough gore...to satisfy most audiences, and that's good enough for most viewers. But, for me, there was just something missing. I saw the film during its original theatrical release, and again recently on VHS. It just left me feeling a bit shallow. It does have entertainment value, though I would not let the kids watch it because of the partial nudity and excessive violence which, ironically, are the hallmarks of this particular genre. This is, afterall, the film that solidified Arnold's stardom, and he does get able assists from his supporting crew, Jones as well as Max von Sydow, who always renders a respectable performance. Watch it if you care to...I found myself dozing off at certain points.",Conan the Barbarian

131,knucklebreather,Fun Epic Fantasy Flick,7,21 November 2010,"""Conan the Barbarian"" is one of the better serious swords and sorcery movies out there. The story of a boy sold into slavery after his family was slaughtered, who as a man became a peerless warrior, ""Conan"" might seem like typical fantasy fare but it rises above the crowd.The score and cinematography are just a notch below ""Lord of the Rings"", which should be good enough for nearly anyone. Sweeping landscapes, realistic cities and castles are accompanied by good but not overbearing music. The acting, while a bit cartoonish by necessity, is very good, especially James Earl Jones as the villain and the legendary Max von Sydow as the fading king. Arnold is quiet even by his standards, but hey, what are you really expecting? He more than looks the part and shouldn't disappoint with his overall performance.The movie does seem a bit generic, however, with its overall story of revenge and with its archetype characters. However, as the movie came out in 1982, it is evident to me that a decade or two of video game designers, among others, heavily ripped off the characters and art from this movie, so I'll give it a bit of a pass here.This might have been the best ""swords and sorcery"" movie yet made when it came out.

The realism of the setting, the customs, the sets just give you the feeling that this is the way it was back then. This is a movie that needs no computer generated effects to use as a crutch. The battle scenes are phenominal. The acting is great. You never once in the movie question any of the characters. The direction is nearly flawless. The story is everything you want in an action-adventure. The character of Conan is a very emotional one, from the sorrow of losing his family and his people to the joy of meeting new friends and new hope to the sorrow and sadness of losing his girlfriend. The development of Conan's character is wonderful, you get to see exactly where he's been and what make him tick. Conan is a true hero. The violence and realism of this movie with nothing held back is what I expect from action movies. Especially since this movie was made in 1982. Nothing else comes close to this day. Will there ever be a movie like this again? No. I have seen this movie more times then I can count and every time I find it as entertaining as ever. The score for this movie is one of the best I have ever heard. The music gets you pumped up and perfectly fits every scene. The swordsmanship of Arnold is phenominal. I love sword fighting movies. No fencing here, its raw swordsmenship skill. The weapons look genuine and they look awesome.Words cannot fully describe the greatness of this movie and the fact that its only got a 6.? rating from the voters totally does it unjustice. I would without a doubt give this a 10. This is a full movie with everything in it. Its got a great ending and leaves us wanting more and more.

Arnie is, well, Arnie, but with long hair and vaguely unsettling sex scenes, up against the endless forces (ok, about eight guys who he slaps with the flat of his sword) of Darth Vader's voice.

Taking a sorcerer from the comics and making them into a Hollywood style cult leader. Boring.Surprisingly tepid depictions of sex, and an utter lack of nudity or even desire for sex. Conan of Robt Howard chased many women, and so did the comics.

Conan fans were angry. Audiences groaned with disappointment. They outright booed at the end when the film tried to set up a sequel. Some of us watched the sequels to laugh at the Plan Nine levels of bad film making.It's pretty obvious the high ratings come from nostalgia for childhood. Some even make obvious mistakes like saying ""I liked Mako in it."" Nope, he was in the just as bad sequel.Clearly their memories of watching it are mixed together with the thrill of seeing it after their parents had gone to bed, hoping to see their first unclothed breast.

138,maxastree,Crom!!,6,4 April 2017,"Pseudo-classic film, features great costume work and photography from the seventies era crew, instead of the slick, commercial-appeal look of 80's action and fantasy era pictures. As has been said before, film flirts with distinctly fascist overtones throughout - eugenics, the breeding of an illiterate warrior class, fundamentalist cults, quotes from Nietzsche on the power and dominance of strength. The film's great score and visual style aren't really matched by it's lead though, as Schwarzenegger is unable to bring much drama, pathos or depth to his role as an orphaned warrior child seeking revenge. Really, the most emotive sequences are created by Basil Poladouris' soundtrack and the stylized set pieces, and there's not much of a story arc to build the film into a legitimate ""epic"" à la Lawrence of Arabia. Oliver Stone who wrote for the movie envisaged a series of powerhouse action-fantasy films appearing every two-three years with Schwarzenegger as the lead, but the series was followed by a garbage sequel, additionally, the fan base ridiculed Arnold's dialogue and acting chops, giving him a Razzie or whatever it is for worst actor of 1982.",Conan the Barbarian
139,MVictorPjinsiste,Surprisingly Deep,8,26 May 2009,"A sublime movie on a seemingly blunt subject; fighting Barbarians.The first thing that is going to hit you is the music, a superb score inspired by Orf's Carmina Burina plus some Turkish influences, strong enough to make any dialogue superfluous. The score alone can tell you about great open spaces and the decadent pomp that is to be found all over the picture.By any other standards the actors here and the dialogue would be sub-par, but let's take a closer look: They are a happy marriage.The title character, his companions noble Subotai and graceful Valeria, are people of little talk, but when they do, they do as if every word would be their last, they don't talk for nothing; almost every sentence in the movie carries philosophy, of a surprising dept about faith, wealth, freedom and destiny. All that is being told by characters who are quite credible in what they represent; in fact, a actor that would be too good would stick out like a sore thumb in this raw setting, and yet, some do with ease like James Earl Jones, magnificent in his role.The sets are magnificent; rough and full of authenticity where prostitutes, beggars, religious zealots, abusive dealers and thieves acting just in the right tone to provide a rich background, without hogging the screen. One has the impression that everyone of them have its own story to tell. You can almost feel the open air, smell the crowded markets and animals, resent the ambient heat. The costumes, apart for a biker-looking coat, hair and mustache on one of the actors, are rich and savage-looking. You will have no trouble believing it all.Un-suspected dept, synergy and yes, intelligence, if of a basic, wise sort, made of ""Conan the Barbarian"" the leading Barbarian movie, up to this very day.",Conan the Barbarian
140,lawrence_elliott,Schwarzenegger Will Always be Remembered for this Role!,7,31 May 2007,"This is really a good movie. The music is wonderful and fitting. The love story between Conan and Valeria is inspiring and alluring. This is a great tale of courage against impossible odds, love, loyalty, friendship, (between Conan and Subotai the Archer), and brutality and cruelty as depicted by James Earl Jones as the Snake King who kills Conan's parent's when he was a boy.There is a journey to far off lands, training in the martial arts of swordsmanship, the ferocity of ancient gladiators, wild dogs and wolves chasing after Conan, (his gift after freedom), the mystery of ancient kings and the Excalibur powers of the Sword of a god-like king bestowed upon him in crisis, cannibalism and cult worship (like a giant Ku Klux Klan meeting), crucifixion, and snakes galore. Subotai, Conan's alter ego friend, and the wizard who tells the tale (Mako), are trusted allies of Conan who make this film work. Valeria is beautifully portrayed by Sandahl Bergman as a warrior princess and Conan and Valeria together have presence on screen.A scene with the Temptress Witch is dazzling. The battle at the end when Conan prays to his god Kromm depicts the courage of ancient times - ""when two stood against many."" With sword in hand, Conan displays the grace and power he has always been noted for. This scene comes after the gods of death tried to take him away to Hades after his crucifixion and subsequent rescue by Subotai and Valeria. This is an heroic and masterful scene that will always be the signature piece for Schwarzenegger as a powerful figure on screen. This film was an inspiration for me many years ago and it still is today.",Conan the Barbarian

The story has enough emotional centerpiece in Conan's quest for revenge, which is rarely done well because most revenge plots are brainless.  Arnold is right for the part, and it's not just the muscles but the facial type required to potray a barbarian.  James Earl Jones is just great as a villain, and I can't imagine Thulsa Doom being portrayed by anyone else. But all in all, this movie is all about setting the right kind of atmosphere to suck you into it's world.

Howard's original material, including his only Conan novel, titled ""Hour of the Dragon,"" and feel he would have been proud of this adaptation of his most popular creation. The casting is excellent and fits well with the limited dialog. Only Schwartzenegger had the presence to portray the world famous Cimmerian and was therefore perfectly cast. Even the side characters were well cast - hardened warriors and thieves are not eloquent speakers and therefore there is no need for top quality actors to fill such roles.There is almost nothing wrong with this movie. Naturally some of the dialog is poor, but it did not feel off and did not detract from the film.

145,ramsfan,Visually Impressive Epic,7,4 March 2010,"Despite being panned by critics at the time of its release, Conan The Barbarian is nonetheless a visually impressive sword and sorcery film with many things going for it. The set designs are outstanding on a grand scale. The film looks and feels authentic to the middle ages. The music by Basil Poledouris is unbelievable- a rousing, driving score which perfectly compliments the action. And it features 7-time Mr. Olympia Arnold Schwartzenegger perfectly cast in the title role.The film begins with Conan as a young boy witnessing a band of marauders led by snake cult warlord Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) invade his village, kill his father and behead his mother as he holds her hand. He is forced on a death march to a work camp, where he spends his days walking the ""wheel of pain"". Many die from the brutal conditions, but Conan is strengthened. As he grows older, he develops into a prime physical specimen and is sent off to be a pit fighter matching his skills against other warriors in fights to the death. He eventually wins his freedom and sets out to avenge the death of his parents while seeking the ""riddle of steel"". Along the way, he runs with thieves, rescues a King's daughter, and experiences love, adventure, riches and loss.The visuals are striking; from the temple interiors to the battle sequences to the isolated shots of a chiseled Schwartzenneger posing and wielding his sword. Fine work is done by supporting actors Mako, Gerry Lopez and Max Von Sydow as King Osric. B-Movie great William Smith has a small, thankless role as Conan's father (killed early in the film). Even ex-Oakland Raider Ben Davidson (is there a more inspired job of casting?!) turns up in a meaty role as villain Rexor. And the stunning Sandahl Bergman is well utilized as Conan's love interest.Making the film in my opinion is James Earl Jones who with one of the greatest voices in cinematic history, cuts a commanding presence as the evil ruler Thulsa Doom. He is totally believable in this role and his performance shines.Even though it's nearly 30 years old, Conan The Barbarian can stand with any of today's similarly themed epics.",Conan the Barbarian
146,liodavix,Genesis of a hero,10,7 February 2019,"Well, Conan the Bárbaro is at this point everything and an icon and undisputed reference of the genre of heroic fantasy.There are very, very few movies within the genre that can make him shade has this, let alone overcome it.And it is that Conan has something that distinguishes it and raises it above almost all others. And that something for me are mainly two things: the narrative structure and the soundtrack.John Millius gave here a lesson worthy of a teacher, when it comes to telling a story. The film is not slow, it's just that you do not want to go fast, but you want to take your time to explain the birth and physical and intellectual development of the character.The genesis of the character is clear, and serves to identify us with Conan, because who is not capable of understanding a child who has seen his people devastated and enslaved in the most cruel and brutal way possible, which he has seen as his father He was murdered and devoured by a pack of dogs and he has finally seen how his mother has been decapitated before his very eyes. That's why we understand and identify with Conan's wishes for revenge and all his actions. Would not we do the same?We do not condemn them, but we understand and support the character completely in what will be his sweet and at the same time bitter vendetta against the guilty of his misfortune in that fantastic and ruthless Hyborian world.Scwharzenegger knew how to give him the physical and all the charisma that the character needed. The rest of secondary is simply unbeatable, highlighting a terrifying and absolutely unforgettable James Earl Jones as Thulsa Doom.And the Sonora band? One of the most beautiful, magical and insurmountable of all the history of cinema.

147,Matador07,Beautifully Brutal,9,11 January 2002,"[Slight Spoilers]This movie represents a bit of a quandary -- how exactly does one go about reviewing ""Conan the Barbarian"" on a site which also includes ""Driving Miss Daisy""?  On the one hand, compared to Daisy, Conan's dialogue, acting, plot, human insight etc. are laughable, at best.  On the other hand, I am fairly sure that Conan could kick Miss Daisy's butt.  So I think the only fair way to do this is to review Conan as an example of its genre -- does Conan do what it set out to do?And if that's the scale, then Conan is a great movie.  This is not the gentle tale of a friendship which buds over a period of decades between an elderly southern lady and her black chauffeur, this is the tale of a musclebound barbarian who watches his family get slaughtered when he is a kid, and dedicates the remainder of his exceedingly violent life to seeking revenge on the guys who did it -- you just can't judge the two movies on the same scale.  Does Conan have its limitations when it comes to acting? Yes, emphatically.  But does that seriously detract from this movie doing what it sets out to accomplish?  Not in the least.  A movie like this doesn't need pinpoint acting and deep, insightful conversation, it needs some serious butt-kicking going on from start to finish -- and that is what this movie delivers in spades.Arnold simply IS Conan, and with the exception of one unintentionally hilarious episode with a giant latex snake, the movie rarely strays into cheesiness.  It was actually one of the few fantasy flicks before the current Lord of the Rings triology to have the guts to take the genre seriously -- its actors all deliver patently ridiculous lines with complete conviction (especially James Earl Jones, who is great), and the result is that this movie is NOT a joke (unlike its much inferior sequel which was almost a parody).  This movie is brutal and primitive, and that is exactly as it should be -- even Arnold's broken English fits the part perfectly (not to mention his ridiculous physique).  Conan hacks a wide and bloody path through his world, and its great fun if this is your sort of thing.  Two warnings however: first, between all of the blood and body parts flying around this may be the ultimate NON-chick flick -- don't expect your girlfriend to ""get it""; second, this movie is such a testosterone rush that you really shouldn't try to drive or operate heavy machinery for at least six hours after viewing it. 8/10 (with special mention to the awesome soundtrack -- as perfectly barbaric as the rest of the movie).",Conan the Barbarian

149,montferrato,Why Conan is one of the Best Movies Ever,10,10 June 2013,"I have watched many times this movie, and it is the best sword and sorcery movie ever made.I have read that some people criticize some things about this movie: First, that the actors are bad, and that Arnold Schwarzenegger acting is wooden . I beg to differ. Conan is a primitive Barbarian Warrior, always circumspect. So, no ""laurence Olivier"" performances are needed. The interpretation of Arnold Scwarzenegger is what the movie needs, as it conveys a sensation of simplicity and authenticity. Barbarians are not chatty ,witty and funny, but silent, circumspect and primitive. So, Scharzenegger does look the part and is perfect for the movie. We do not need ""Stanislawsky Interpretation techniques"". It is just Conan. As for other actors, they are OK. People seem to forget that in this movie there are excellent actors: Max Von Sydow, who gives a short but convincing performance as King Osric, and Earl Jones, who gives a good performance as the evil Thulsa Doom. As for the others,they are effective, and serve very well the story's needs without unnecessary displays. Second, they say that the action is slow, and that there is not much dialog. Again, dialog is not much needed in this movie, and when it is necessary, it is done by great actors like James Earl Jones. In fact, the fact that there is not much dialog conveys a sensation of reality and authenticity to the movie, even of antiquity. This fact helps us believe that we are actually in a primitive and primordial world. We do not need in Conan chatty characters making jokes to appeal to a poorly cultivated audience and keep the interest of the less cultured and intelligent audience. So, in my opinion, the fact that they do not speak much is a key factor in the success of this movie, as it makes us believe that we are in a primitive, magic, cruel, ancient and primordial world, where action speaks louder than words. In sum, the lack of dialog makes the movie far more credible and authentic.Some other guy said that there is ""little violence"" in this movie: this is just not true. The movie starts with the burning, pillage and mass extermination and murder of the inhabitants of a whole village, and the children of the village sold as slaves to some northern mercenaries. In this first scenes, a child, the young Conan watches like his own mother is beheaded in front of him. We see how the child still holds his mother's hand when his mother's head is chopped, dismembered, and flying among sprays of blood.The success of this movie is total, and this is because the story is so well told that this is probably the only Sword and Sorcery movie that makes you feel that it all could have happened in a distant primitive world, thousands of years before. This does not happen with other epic films like Lord of the Rings, where you see characters falling from a precipice fighting with dragons, only to be saved in the last minute(therefore, unreal, a stunt designed for young audiences who shout Wow¡¡ in the cinema). In Conan is very easy to suspend disbelief, and think that all really happened, as the movie conveys a true feeling of authenticity and classicism. Not many movies have done this in this movie genre. Perhaps none. Conan is not actually a movie for children. While we all know that the children of this time are used to see lots more of Violence than Conan's, we all must remember that this is a 1982 movie, made 31-32 years ago. In this movie we see violent murders, beheadings, ritual cannibalism, non consensual sex, mass orgies, prostitution, ritual human sacrifice, ritual suicide, temple profanation,alcoholism, thefts, mass murder, slavery, religious fanaticism, primitive demonic rites, necrophilia, black-magic, drug traficking, magic use of hallucinogenic substances, desecration of tombs, robberies, witchcraft and even hints of homosexuality. So, this is not for Children, as it is Lord of the Rings. Also, here, the characters are not so plain as it appears. In fact, in a movie like Lord of the Rings, the characters are far more plain actually, as they are all ""Black & White"". This means that the good guys are unbelievably good, and the bad guys unbelievably bad(therefore, unreal). Here, none of the good guys are actually good, and morals are not important. They are described just as they are, and for that reason, all the Conan Characters are very credible, real and authentic. A great Movie, a true legend, with a superb atmosphere. Conan the Barbarian is the story of a revenge, told in epic ""friedrich Nietzsche"" grandeur. Conan is the incarnation of the myth of the ""Super-Human or Super-Man"". Thulsa Doom represents religion, superstition, and religious power as a way to control people. Conan, in epic Grandeur, is the wronged man who takes revenge by taking control of his own life by Killing the Demigod Thulsa Doom, beheading him in front of his followers, and throwing his head down the stairs of the temple for the astonishment of his cult followers(it symbolizes the death of god and the coming of the super-man). Then,he burns the temple, and takes the princess with him, being the final scene a ""so speaks Zarathustra"" epic end, in which a new era, free of the slavery of religion is about to come. Some criticized this anti-Christian or anti-religious ideology. The movie does indeed praise individualism above all, and it does indeed criticize religion. That is also the reason why some saw in the movie some ""fascistoid"" ideology related to the Master-Slave morality of Friedrich Nietsche.",Conan the Barbarian
150,garrettderose,"Dated, but very epic and worth the watch",7,16 September 2009,"Conan the Barbarian makes me want to pick up a sword and bang it on stuff.The dialog is great, almost Shakespearian in feel. The characters speak to one another as characters in the old world should. Arnold's acting (for being an earlier/earliest film of his) was really superb. The orgy/doom-snake scene was masterfully made, I wish there were more scenes of the cult's doings.This movie needs to be remade. I understand that a CGI/animated Conan movie is coming out next year... I think it's going to turn out like Beowulf. Even the best CGI isn't 1/100th as pleasing as the worst props and wardrobes.Conan excels in it's sheer epicness. Once a slave, then a king by his own hand... it doesn't get much better. The movie re-ignites a bloodthirsty manliness that usually isn't there. Not even 300 does that for me.I wish modern filmmakers would take notes from Conan before attempting to make movies of the same genre.Conan isn't a perfect movie, but I'm sure that if I were a teen/adult in 1982, this would probably be one of my favorite movies of all time.",Conan the Barbarian
151,Dock-Ock,Thief;Warrior;Gladiator;King : Sword and Sorcery at its greatest.,8,23 August 2001,"Conan The Barbarian is the most impressive Sword and Sorcery movie in my opinion. For two main reasons, the first, a capable actor who resembles the part of Conan : Arnold Schwarzenegger, and a director with enough enthusiasm and an obvious love of his material : John Milius. Add to the mix fantastic sets, a truly dedicated script by Milius and co writer Oliver Stone wich is the perfect homage to Conans creator Robert Howard, and brilliant support from the likes of Max Von Sydow and James Earl Jones. Arnold's acting isn't his most impressive, but works because of all of the above things, and also perhaps because of his on screen gelling with co-star Sandahl Bergman. For what it is worth Schwarzenegger IS Conan. His casting is as good as Christopher Reeve as Superman, or Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. James Earl Jones is EVIL as the villain, and Max Von Sydow comes over as very creepy. And Basil Poledouris comes up with one of the most muscular and memorable soundtracks in motion picture history, so much so that i can't wait to hear it in the upcoming Milius directed, Schwarzenegger starring King Conan. Keep your Star Wars, for pure fantasy adventure, watch this.",Conan the Barbarian
152,bellabanana93,Wonderful Adventure Movie,9,12 October 2017,"I enjoyed Conan the Barbarian a lot. This movie is about a barbarian child whose parents were killed by an evil sorcerer. After Conan grows into up a strong and determined man, he sets out to avenge his parents and his tribe.Conan is played by Arnold Schwartzenegger whose appearance and composure is perfect for this role. His character and other supporting characters could have been better developed, but Arnold did play Conan very well for what he had to work with.My favourite part was the music. It brought such life, meaning, and depth to each scene and enhanced the plot. With music, lighting, and great camera angles, the producers set the scene and pull you into the movie. The fighting scenes are performed to excellence.This movie is full of action. The dialogue is entertaining and the costumes are done very well. This movie is not meant to be very realistic as it is a fantasy flick. Many scenes may seem ""unbelievable"" or ""unrealistic"". Great film to watch by yourself or with friends. There is tons of vulgarity and violence making this movie unsuitable for children.",Conan the Barbarian
153,tom-darwin,The Grandest Flexfest of the Hyborian Age,7,13 April 2006,"It took nearly 50 years from the untimely death of Howard, one of the most promising short-story authors ever, to bring his best-known hero to the big screen. The randy, brawling, but honorable freebooter of most of the Conan stories (""Jewels of Gwahlur,"" ""Black Colossus"") is ignored in the Stone/Milius opus in favor of the brooding avenger that Howard more rarely portrayed (""Beyond the Black River""). In the mythical, pre-Atlantean Hyborian Age, Conan, the young son of a master swordmaker (Smith) in uncivilized, frozen Cimmeria, is enslaved & eventually trained as a gladiator. Winning his freedom, the grown (overgrown) Conan goes in search of the cult leader (Jones in a wig borrowed from Elvira, now live-action creepy instead of ""Star Wars"" creepy) who destroyed his home. Though he had acted before, Schwarzenegger was then best known as Mr. Universe, so his entourage & antagonists are suitably filled with the best that the modern physical arts can provide. These include snake priest Rexor (football star Davidson, nearly as commanding as Arnold), cult lieutenant Thorgrim (fellow pumpmeister Thorsen), wiry thief & archer Subodai (surfing legend Lopez) & sexy loner Valeria, Conan's love interest (dancer Bergman). If seasoned actors Jones, von Sydow & Mako are intimidated by all the surrounding sinew, they never show it, but tough character actor Smith is fit enough to keep up with the athletes. Milius fields the peculiar but limited talents of his cast with an ingenuity that Genghis Khan would admire--he's probably as good at chess as Kubrick. Arnold is convincing as the grimacing, grunting Conan, who rarely speaks unless he's drunk (so THAT'S why he talks funny!), a basically decent guy who's Just Gotta Do What a Man's Gotta Do. Bergman walks him through their scenes together like Annie Sullivan working with Helen Keller (now that is creepy). There's plenty of skin & action (very impressive, spectacular action), but not quite enough to justify ""Conan's"" length. A fast reader could get through half the Howard collection more quickly. ""Conan"" is an interlude in the post-Vietnam, baby-boomer angst between Milus's ""Apocalypse Now"" script & Stone's ""Platoon,"" with the same sense of the futility of finely honed warriors betrayed by the collective madness of the decayed world they must live in. They fight one another in the madness, but they can only escape by betraying the warrior code (that is, being a sissy), or dying & going to Valhalla. With ""Conan,"" Milius had a chance to get beyond the stiffness of that theme (and Stone beyond the despair), but the film doesn't quite manage, despite its ebullient cast. Basil Poledouris's fantastic music--the most heroic yet pensive dramatic theme since Beethoven's ""Coriolan Overture""--is occasionally the only thing keeping ""Conan"" from being depressing, something that just wouldn't do. Still, watch the other big-budget fantasy efforts of the next 20 years (including ""Conan the Destroyer"") to see just how far wrong Milius & Stone could have gone. In fact, ""Conan the Barbarian"" is a worthy, if gloomy, resuscitation of an enjoyable, timeless genre that went into a coma with the last of the ""Sinbad"" series & the advent of ""Star Wars."" It's not quite a star-making role for Arnold, who in a couple of years would start merging his own identity with that of the Terminator. In time he would become Governor by popular acclaim and wear a silk suit beneath a troubled brow...but that is another story.",Conan the Barbarian
154,jerome_horwitz,This is a good action flick,6,22 February 2005,"I like this movie a lot. Of course, the star Arnold is bulging in his younger days still. He's a very impressive specimen at that time.This movie starts out with Conan as a young child. His father is a blacksmith, and knows the importance of steel. Conan learns this as a child as his village is attacked and everyone is either murdered or enslaved.Conan grows, eventually his masters use him as a prize fighter. Eventually Conan grows beyond their control, and his masters decide to let him escape only to turn around and hunt him down to kill him. However Conan actually escapes his masters, and survives to learn the ways of the barbarian.The rest of the movie plays out as Conan seeks the man and people that killed his parents, and destroyed his village. This is no easy task, as Conan searches on for the murderers. Eventually he learns what he needs to, and makes his way to the land of the murderers. But he must still then figure out how to exact his revenge.Fortunately there is a lot of detail to this story not outlined here.The supporting cast is excellent, including James Earl Jones, Mako and more.This movie features some great special effects during some important scenes that are even shockingly realistic. Of course, there's some slightly cheesier effects as well.Just watch the movie, and enjoy it for what it is: a good flick.6/10",Conan the Barbarian

I had posters of the Death Dealer on my wall.When the team for this movie went looking for people to play Conan, they found perhaps the most perfect person on the planet at that time, Arnold. Arnold was made to play Conan. He has the hair, he has the scowl, he has the muscles. It was perhaps one of the most perfect actor to comic hero matches in film history.They needed good music. They found Basil Poledouris, virtually unknown in N. America. He produced one of the greatest movie soundtracks in history, right up there with John Williams Star Wars. His music thunders with hoof beats, slashing swords, and the undiscovered horizon, making you want to scream a war cry and gallop off into the sunset to war.After playing Darth Vader, James E.

158,MarshallStax,More subtle and emotional than you may think,8,12 August 2001,"Others have gone on at great length about the epic qualities of the cinematography, score, sets, costuming and action sequences. All are justified. I wish to point out the fantastic, literate dialogue, especially of Thulsa Doom. Where is the praise for the intelligence of the screenplay, what with its familiar yet fresh retelling of the archetypal hero's journey?Much philosophical and theological debate ensues between characters without real resolution: smart. I would like attention to be directed at the moments of acting scattered throughout the film that touch without words: Conan practicing the sword then contemplating his own hands, Valeria and Conan embracing tightly at the end of their lovemaking scene as if desperately holding on to each other might stem the tide of tragedy that is sure to follow, Thulsa Doom hypnotizing Conan's mother with only his deep, impossibly intense eyes before cutting her brutally down before her son... These are all moments of sheer visual impact, of small things writ large through the body language of the actors and the eye of director John Milius.Keep your ""Braveheart"": if I want to revel in mythical storytelling with swords galore, I'll watch ""Conan"" again. This is an absolute classic, marred only by the stilted delivery of... Sandahl Bergman! Many complain about Arnold's acting, but Conan IS a barbarian, after all: his character is NOT silver-tongued! Arnold inhabits the role well physically and his lack of facility with English does not detract from his performance one bit. Well, okay, I'll also concede that the animated demons that come and try to take Conan's soul in one sequence are a bit hokey. But in 1983, they gave me chills up and down my spine.",Conan the Barbarian
159,Global_Marketing_Pros,Ethos and Pathos of leadership with the ancient world,8,28 March 2007,"Conan the Barbarian is a great mythical adventure tale that seems to have many archaeological facts inter-woven into its plot. Especially with themes of religion, where the essence of character's ethos and pathos become even more outstandingly portrayed.Within the Hasmonean kingdom as a reference I think this ancient period deals with the control of political power via religious competition. This seems the main battle within Conan the Barbarian movie plot where the ethos and pathos of self righteous actions are being controlled. Hence the use of suicide to demonstrate this overwhelming power by the leaders, or priests, of the snake cult. I think that this movie plot is a tangent theme of the quote, ""might makes right"", where the movie quote, ""Riddle of Steele"", is grounded in the knowledge of doing business, political fairness (striking of coinage), and mass production of metal weapons.",Conan the Barbarian
160,Vastarien202,Perfect.,10,12 September 2009,"Conan is the first film I ever remember watching. We had it on laserdisc when I was young, and later on VHS and now I own it on DVD. This film has literally shaped my life and followed me as I grew up. I have no further praise to add, for others have posted more eloquently than I can manage. Simply, this is a story of revenge, redemption, freedom, power, and true strength. The score raises this film to true greatness, never wasting a note. No author yet has had such a faithful adaptation of his work, with perhaps the exception of the LOR trilogy. I only hope that this epic film never gets re-made, because it could never be so perfect again. It may be dated, the effects non-flashy, and the pace a bit slow, but it still speaks to many on a deeply personal level which can never be put into words. If you haven't seen it yet, do so. Tell your friends, and let them see it too.",Conan the Barbarian
161,HulkVader,A personal favorite,10,19 September 2000,"Stunning, to both the eyes and ears, Conan the Barbarian is a brooding, brilliant film. The dialogue is very limited, purposefully - the intent of co-writers John Milius and Oliver Stone. Rather, they wanted the feeling of the film conveyed via the fantastic soundtrack composed by Basil Poledouris. The music is as grand and epic as the scene settings, huge and majestic. James Earl Jones and Schwarzenegger were both awesome in their respective portrayals. Certainly not a ""hack-and-slash"" sword and sorcery film, Conan is a film of tremendous depth. The emotion is evident in mood, facial expressions, and sound, not words. If the viewer either desires or requires things bluntly explained to them, the film will seem largely unexplained and perhaps less enjoyable. However, that won't be the case for someone proficient in more subtle communication. Forget renting this one, do yourself a favor and go buy a copy. 10/10.",Conan the Barbarian
162,sirfire,Its my generation,9,2 May 2010,"Sure it had goofs and well the special effects didn't date well. But boy what a great story line that amazes me how many people just don't get it.Yes we can say its a comic book cheesy style but that is just one level. I find the story good and i find it reflecting so many things that we see today. It had a hint of magic without the need to make it completely unbelievable and thats how i like fantasy stories.Think about this, the story is about power, control and mind of matter and the ability to control others. (quote from the movie) Conan: The riddle... of steel. Thulsa Doom: Yes! You know what it is, don't you boy? Shall I tell you? It's the least I can do. Steel isn't strong, boy, flesh is stronger! Look around you. There, on the rocks; a beautiful girl. Come to me, my child... Thulsa Doom: (coaxes the girl to jump to her death) Thulsa Doom: That is strength, boy! That is power! What is steel compared to the hand that wields it? Look at the strength in your body, the desire in your heart, I gave you this!"" (end quote) Its about the ""The riddle to life"" and manipulation and control of yourself and others. To me it says a lot about religion and how it can control people to do things that normal people just wouldn't do.If we could freeze Arnie and James Earl Jones for 25 years then redo this movie with all the special effects and CGI we have today with some minor changes to the script to include political correctness you would have a MAJOR hit on your hands.Sadly most cant see past dated special effects, so I gave it a 10 to counter it.",Conan the Barbarian

165,nirome,A perfect sword and sorcery tale for the ages,10,6 January 2019,"This must be, along with Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, the perfect example of what a sword and sorcery tale should be like. Although it doesn't have the fantasy elements of the above mentioned LOTR trilogy, it does share many of its grounded elements. It relies heavily on its story development and its characters' actions are relatable to the audience. Unlike many other movies of this genre, you do actually care for the characters. Conan's journey is one of self discovery and revenge. In this instance, the election of such an unlikely actor at the time, such as Schwarzenegger, to portray this character, actually suits the purposes of the movie, given the brooding and silent nature of the character. It doesn't really matter the strong German accent of Schwarzenegger, cause in this instance it highlights the barbaric nature of his character. He's a barbarian. He's supposed to sound like it. The supporting cast does a magnificent job and gives the whole thing the quality that it deserves. Special mention to Max Von Sydow and James Earl Jones. The use of the Spanish locations and magnificent cinematography is superb. From the very beginning we, the audience, feel like we're transported to another time and land and the brutal nature of its fight scenes, the final showdown of Conan and Sumotai against the troops of Tulsa Doom, comes to mind. Although well choreographed and shot, there's a crudeness to the sword fights that was regrettably missing in the movie's sequel. Strong script penned by the great Oliver Stone, solid direction by John Milius, probably his masterpiece on what should have been the first installment in his planned Conan Anthology. Unfortunately, the producers decided to ditch the more grounded and serious tone of this first movie and decided to go with a more lighthearted and clearly children oriented tone for the sequel. If I was forced to go with a Schwarzenegger movie character for him to be remembered by, I would have to go with this one. Clearly the best and only choice for the role at the time, this is definitely the role he was born to play. Perfectly suited to his strengths. So many great scenes this movie is remembered for; the attack of the village at the very beginning, Conan's enslavement and consequent pit fighting achievements, his sword fight training at the end of which he's finally freed by his master, first encounter with the supernatural in the form of a seductive witch, his friendship with Sumotai,... All of this punctuated by Basil Poledouris' masterful score. In short, this is what comes out when the best talent of the time and all the right cinematographic stars align.",Conan the Barbarian
166,thirdi,They just don't make 'em like they used to,10,23 June 2004,"""Conan the Barbarian"" is one of those rare sword & sorcery movies that actually worked. It's an epic film that wasn't afraid to be graphic. It's amazing these days how many movies are big, violent, and loud, but it's all just so light. With the exception of ""Braveheart"" and a few others, most movies that aim to portray realistic, pre-gun action fall way short and become comic books. Not that graphic violence is something to be glorified, but if you're going to make a movie about barbarians it should have the elements that director John Milius poured into Conan.Essentially, Conan is set apart from the other sword movies of the 80's due to its relentless, almost sadistic bloodletting. The gore, the splattering blood, gratuitous nudity, male dominance, orgies, murderous religious cults, sex slaves, belly dancers and giant snakes all made up for a fine cinematic experience. It is basically the ultimate ""hunter-gatherer"" film. Not necessarily celebrating all of these things, but just saying it's possible the world was just this crazy at some point in the past.James Earl Jones' absolutely creepy performance as Thulsa Doom is a classic role. John Milius took the bombast and brutality of the source material and transferred it onto screen nicely. The musical score is also one of the most amazing you'll ever hear. From the first moments at the beginning credits with monstrous drums beating over a Nietzsche quote, it's very powerful stuff.Arnold has always done pretty much the same thing, but he does it very well in this one. I don't know why but I've always been a fan of movies like this, even the bad ones. But Conan is definitely a good one, even great, and it's the king of all the 80's sword fantasy movies.",Conan the Barbarian

The photography is superb (often copied) and the score is EXQUISITE...not just the same theme repeated over and over.  Enough has been said (by others) about the acting, fighting, blood, etc., so let's talk about different aspects.What of the humor?  This movie is often very funny. Priestess:  ""What do you see"" Conan (looking into water):  ""Uh...infinity."" Priestess:  ""...Good.""And who can forget that slimy priest trying to talk Conan out of his skivvies?  The look on Conan's face as he says:  ""I'm afraid I'm shy...can we talk over there, where the others cannot see?""The best part of this smart movie is the philosophy, though.  The circular arguments of Thulsa Doom's point of view, as experienced by Conan on the Wheel of Pain, and glimpsed in Thulsa's battle standard.  The refutation of Conan's father's cosmology as the steel breaks in Rexor's hand.Anybody notice that Conan is a Christ symbol, by the way?A full throttle film that delivers is a rarity.

Yea, LOTR was great and all, and so was SW, but Conan the Barbarian is in the same league as those films! How can you not see that? I do admit that it does get to be boring at times, but both LOTR and SW HAVE THOSE SAME PROBLEMS!!!What makes this film so remarkable is how well the score, by Basil Poledouris, ties the film together. The score drives this movie, from beginning to end. Maybe that's why I fell in love with this movie when I was a young lad. Just the percussion of Anvil of Crom (opening title) keeps reverberating within my head on a continuous loop, but not a loop that's truly conscious. Yea, I know, a movie score doesn't make a movie, but ya know what does? Characterization. James Earl Jones, The ""Governator"", and Ben Davidson (Rexor for the uneducated) do splendid jobs. Though JEJ doesn't quite have the screen time I wish he had, the mystery surrounding his character is fascinating and how he delivers it to. The Governator, well, obviously lives the role of Conan and will always be Conan. Rexor was probably the best character of the film. He was emotional, driven, and just plain fun to watch. ***SPOILER***The final battle was by far the best.

The film lingers on gorgeous shots of the landscape or on characters traveling and having conversations. It doesn't plod along like Lord of the Rings, but rather disperses these slow, drawn-out moments in between bursts of intense, bloody action scenes.

170,retrorocketx,The Best Sword and Sorcery Film,10,3 December 2008,"Robert E Howard is often credited with inventing the sword and sorcery genre with the introduction of one of the all-time great fantasy characters, Conan the Barbarian. This was way back in the early 1930s. Writer Karl Wagner describes sword and sorcery as, ""...a fascinating synthesis of horror, adventure, and imagination...the common motif is a universe in which magic works and an individual may kill according to his personal code."" The atmosphere of sword and sorcery is charged with violence, darkness, sexuality, and supernatural perils. The themes of the stories often reach deep into the abyss of cosmic horror and dread. It takes quite a hero to stride undaunted and undeterred across this landscape! In the early 1980s Conan got his first film. It launched Arnold Schwarzenegger's career. It was a brilliant film, flawed, but it soared above its flaws. It has been often imitated since then, yet most of those efforts failed miserably. Why do imitation films fail in this genre? Because they focus on the half-naked babes, the half-naked muscle bound (and often angry) hero, the violent fights, the wizards with special effects at their fingertips, as if this were enough. But they fail to capture the fundamental and necessary element of the genre - a subtle atmosphere of the supernatural and the uncanny. There must be a credible, ever-present but not over-done supernatural theme pervading the setting. The darkness, the pathos, the sense of horror necessary for the genre entered for a few moments of the film. The witch, the wizard, the evil priest of the snake cult, the cultist's suicide, the scene where the spirits are trying to steal Conan's soul, the occasional banter about the gods, the orgy...all of these elements capture the proper atmosphere. The sorcery is not overblown, nor is it all about special effects. Few S&S movies get this right. Conan the Barbarian shows how it is done. There are a few issues with the movie that will bother Conan purists. For me, the worst is Conan's childhood (a subject never touched upon in the books, and I hate it when writers murder the parents to provide motivation for a character). But all in all, I imagine Robert Howard would be happy with this Conan. A few of the scenes were right out of his stories - the crucifixion tree, the ghostly help from a dead girlfriend, gigantic snakes, thieves climbing a mysterious tower. Sadly missing are the monstrous man-apes, or unnatural creatures summoned out of the abyss by sorcerers, both of which feature prominently in Conan stories. The music is awesome, James Earl Jones and Sandahl Bergman are fabulous. And of course Arnold is perfect. I keep hoping for another great Sword and Sorcery movie.

It deserves a 10/10 along with Gandhi and Bladerunner, due in most part to that most elusive of artistic achievements: telling a story well with cinema cameras.The screenplay for Conan is outstanding, each scene is brimming with spectacle, magic and meaning from Conan's early servitude, through his training as a warrior, culminating in his defeat of Thulsa Doom.The production values are high, not a CGI pixel in sight, giving the film a solidity from which many modern filmmakers could learn. In fact, its a powerful statement regarding how little film making really needs CGI trickery.Memorable performances from the cast, my favorite remaining the committed portrayal by Sandahl Bergman as brave brigand, Valeria. She was injured during a fight sequence, but returned, to finish filming. That's true courage, film fans!",Conan the Barbarian
172,LordBlacklist,Not to be overlooked,10,7 September 2005,"People have preconceptions of what makes a good move and more often than not they get tangled up in their own web of closed mindedness. It is no one thing that makes a movie great but a combination of all to create a feeling, and that is one thing that Conan has always done for me.This was the first film that introduced me to ""the goosebump effect"" or rather seeing scenes of such emotional and thematic power that they give you chills. After watching this film over and over again it still doesn't disappoint. The scene immediately following the raid on Conan's village is a true masterpiece of visual storytelling. Without a single line of dialogue everything that is to come in the next two hours is set up with the Murder of Conan's parents before his eyes. The look of disbelief on his face as his mother's lifeless body falls before him. Staring at his hand and then toward Thulsa Doom. The Villain saluting his freshly stolen steel. It is a perfectly executed scene that were this film not so unjustly written off as a hack and slash ""sword and sorcery"" picture would be rightfully remembered as one of the great scenes in film history.The best way to describe Conan would be to call it a philosophical epic. There are real ideas and philosophies at play in the narrative. Conan's father's teachings of steel...the opening scene forging the sword becoming a metaphor for Conan's life. He is a character created by hardship and grief, and like the opening quote says ""That which does not kill us makes us stronger"" Conan becomes more powerful with the more hardships he overcomes. The film is very well put together. Many scenes and images from the movie are as visually layered and well thought out as any Ridley Scott picture. The prelude to the opening battle in the snow is stunning with great visual flair, a single scout stands atop a boulder breathing heavy, anticipating battle as vibrant rays of sunlight pour through the trees.There is a ritualistic quality to many of the scenes in the film such as the finding of the atlantean sword, or the lead up to Conan's duel with the snake which is carried through right to the end where after Conan drops his sword the followers of doom extinguish their flames in the fountain. Everyone in the film manages to give a good performance but the big mistake that most people make in judging them is that they do not understand that acting is not simply saying lines of dialogue, it is behavior. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest of the cast give outstanding performances without saying all that much. The scene at the funeral pyre where Conan runs his hand through the hair of his fallen love...the subtle look of grief withheld combined with the eloquent score is enough to get the idea across, no dialogue is needed. Basil Poledouris' score for the film has to be one of, if not, the greatest score ever composed and it plays an integral part in creating the rich emotional landscape of John Milius' epic film. Conan the barbarian is a film I saw when I was very young, and through the years as I have gotten a little older and wiser the film has gotten richer and more rewarding with each subsequent viewing.This is a film of great resonance and subtlety. Most audiences today cannot appreciate a film that requires a bit of deep thinking, but this is one of the rare films that is even more rewarding if you look beneath the surface.",Conan the Barbarian
173,chrisleary-34067,A real Barbarian saga!,9,29 September 2020,"Well, Arnold has really set the tone for action movies with a real story set from a young age to adult showing how someone can really be changed by extreme life events and how you can focus on and live for something through revenge but should only be in the movies and not in real life otherwise we would end up with a real life purge situation. The theme tune and score was again amazing and I love it and for me again this movie is like having 3 square meals and for me is the prefect saga.",Conan the Barbarian

for the movie i don't need to say much.(i'm arnold's huge fan)i dont think that will be ever an epic movie like Conan The Barbarian.everything worked like a swiss watch. acting,direction(great job John Milius) fight scenes,photography,storyline.Its my number 1 movie and i've seen hundreds.",Conan the Barbarian
175,Maxta,The movie that made Schwarznegger famous.,7,10 July 2000,"One of Arnolds earlier films puts him in the feudal ages with no shirt and a big sword. The storyline is surprisingly quite good, more than you would expect from an early Arnie movie. The best acting performances in this film must go to Akiro (??? ???) and Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). Akiros narration through the first part of the film is a brilliant touch, and Thulsa Dooms stare remains clear in your mind days after seeing it. James Earl Jones was perfectly cast for this part, his menacing glare and authoritive voice fit Doom's character to perfection. The fight scenes and cinematography are also very well done.The musical score deserves special mention as THE best in any movie ever. Never has the music in a scene fitted so well with what is happening on screen. You will be humming and whistling it for days I promise.Overall a great film, highly recommended.",Conan the Barbarian

Perhaps it does not follow the original book it is based on, but i have not read it, and i am reviewing the movie.I think every movie lover should watch this classic, it is made in 1982 but its ahead of its time in storytelling, the acting is quite wooden obviously because its Arnold but that only compliments the characters, this movie is not about talking and showing emotions, it is about atmosphere and adventure - and it really delivers, even many modern sword epics lack what this film succeeds to deliver.This film seems like an actual attempt to make a film, unlike the cash grab that was made with Jason Momoa later on. The second Conan the barbarian with Arnold was just weird.Also the musical landscape in this film gives a very nice enchantment to the atmosphere as well.This film is EPIC.",Conan the Barbarian

178,schaefer.oliver,Still my No. 1 movie,10,19 March 2002,"Even 21 years after its release, this is still my No.1 movie. Big, brutal and bloody, watching this movie is still a great experience. The visual effects are not up to date, but otherwise it hasn't lost any of it's power over the years. This is the only John Milius film I liked from the first to the last minute. The look is great, it has phantastic camerawork, superb production design and a score no other composer has ever come close. Composer Basil Poledouris has never composed anything nearly as good as this rousing and sweeping music. Even his music for the sequel was a letdown and sounded as if they slashed the number of musicians half the size of the first recording session. The fight sequences are fantastic and include some stunts that preceded today's ""Wire-Fu"" by 20 years. The story and the way it is told is also great, primarily because of the little amount of dialogue in the film. Everything is transported through the music and the camerawork, so that there are no more words necessary to let the audience know what is going on. So for me this film succeeded on every level and I hope that if ""King Conan"" really materializes, that it will be true to ""Conan the barbarian"" and will let anyone forget ""Conan the destroyer"".",Conan the Barbarian
179,clauzy82,A Visual & Aural Masterpiece,10,20 May 2021,"Has a story ever been told so well on the big screen with so little dialogue? Everything in this movie is meaningful, has its place from the music to every little high impact word spoken, creating one of the most atmospheric films of all time. Every piece of dialogue is crucial, packs a punch and a lot of the actors that generate this dialogue have powerful voices like James Earl Jones, Mako, William Smith and Max von Sydow. Some not as powerful but memorable and unique in their own way like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sandahl Bergman and Gerry Lopez to name a few. Bustling with quotes you'll remember forever.How does this film get so much negativity? Because it is an absolute masterpiece. I put it down to arrogance, close mindedness or delusions of grandeur: too low brow of a film for a certain breed.It also gets a bashing as being so far removed from the original stories by Robert E Howard. Wrong. I only ask you to read those stories and see for yourself how this film actually brought Conan and his world of the Hyborian Age to life, it might not follow a specific storyline, but this is Conan in the flesh and blood direct from the pages. CROM!We are delivered into it straight away by epic music from Basil Poledouris and an overwhelming narration by the chronicler Mako (who also plays The Wizard), along with a great visual of a sword being made and finally the riddle of steel by Conan's father (William Smith). Already you are completely invested in this movie. This sense of mythical awe is quickly overshadowed by fast paced action with a great fight scene, high impact emotion and the music to match. In short Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who's village is destroyed, is captured and sold into slavery. This is a film about him growing from a boy to a man, as he seeks to find himself. A story for the ages, characters you'll never forget, a journey of revenge, greed and adventure. Two snakes come together as one.The acting is all solid Arnold Schwarzenegger (Conan) knew his limits, learned a lot from the other cast and threw himself head first into this film with the scars to show for it. He owned it and is the epitome of Conan. Like Arnie, Sandahl Bergman (Valeria) threw herself into this role and it paid off, being her most iconic film. James Earl Jones (Thulsa Doom) was brilliant as usual and plays a memorable villain. Max von Sydow (King Osric) has a small role but impactful. Gerry Lopez (Subotai), William Smith (Conan's Father), Ben Davidson (Rexor), Mako (The Wizard), Valérie Quennessen (The Princess), Cassandra Gava (The Witch), Jorge Sanz (Young Conan), Sven-Ole Thorsen (Thorgrim) and the beautiful Nadiuska (Conan's Mother) all put in masterful performances.If somehow you have missed this epic... Watch it now. It is a standout in film making, when they knew their limits and got everything spot on.For the cheese fans it does have a lot of borderline cheese, but you get lost in the film you might not even notice: One moment during a crucifixion, a vulture meets a fitting end/Smashing the rust off the sword to reveal a perfect sword under it are two of my favourites.",Conan the Barbarian
180,mynystry,A very good fantasy film,8,10 October 2005,"This is a very strong film that tells a VERY modified story of Conan, the character created by Howards in his series of books written in the 1930's. Actually I don't see a good reason for modifying the original stories in those great fiction books... but well, maybe the director John Milius also wanted to put a piece of his imagination on the tale, but it is clearly he isn't a writer that could compete with Howards.However Milius is a good director in this film; The film is very constant in keeping the mood up, the actors are also good, specially Arnold, to whom the role of ""Barbarian"" Conan fits more than perfectly. The other main actors have also an acceptable acting, even the role of the wizard.The special effects are not so bad for the time, only the ghosts that try to take Conan's body look kinda funny, but without the computers of today, I think it was just not easy to represent such things...Another important thing of this film is the music... The score written by Basil Poledouris s doubtless a classic; Conan without this music wouldn't be the same! This is a good film for the genre.Just a last advise: If you like this film, please be careful with watching the second film of Conan ""the destroyer"" which is really, really, really, reaaally crappy, and has not much to do with the first one.",Conan the Barbarian

I get intrigued and watched again the movie, after so many years. No doubt that today so much blood is no scandal, but the film has the right gore, violence and sex that Conan deserved.Best compliment for a film is that gets old in good shape, and Conan does. The film has the right mixture, fiction and epic, violence and sex, fights and blood.The plot is simple, revenge, but it's very well dressed and set and background are interesting in themselves.

Arnie at his minimal dialogue, muscle flexing best.  Classic fight scenes over the top sets and skimpy costumes, what not to like about this film.  Yes, the film does look dated and has a huge rubber snake but it's no worse than the cgi in the Mummy and looks much better than the Mummy returns.  Although everyone will disagree with me, I say Conan the Barbarian is more enjoyable than Lord Of The Rings and is maybe the best fantasy film of all time.  I just hope that if Arnie does make a third installment of Conan, it will be better than Conan The Destroyer.",Conan the Barbarian
184,myrothe,One of the BEST! An epic classic.,10,4 July 2005,"I gotta say as I write this I am a little biased, this is probably my favorite movie of all time (although I have a few of those :) ). There is just so much to love about this movie. The writing is great, it is truly an epic story. Conan is a thief, a warrior, a gladiator, a lover, and an instrument of revenge. Arnold plays the character perfectly. He is never too over the top (unlike the horrible sequel) and although a brutal warrior you also find yourself identifying with him in some aspects. The plot is decent and reaches beyond the standard cheesy 80's fare. The supporting cast is also great. The thief is fearsome, the wizard is hilarious, the woman warrior is well played, and James Earl Jones as Thulsa Doom is an excellent piece of casting. What I also really like is the setting and costumes. Basiclly the ""feel"". Everything looks very primitive and dirty. Its convincing. The setting is sort of an Asian/Mongolian dark ages type area. Very fitting. Everything looks very dirty, tattered and period correct rather than looking clean and Hollywood fantasy-like. The combat is quick, brutal and bloody. Another shinning light of this movie is the soundtrack. Basil Poledouris has crafted one of the most powerful and epic scores I've ever heard. The whole thing is very fitting and thrilling. It goes from brutally pounding to melodic and adds infinitely to the experience. From the brutal opening scenes to the thrilling conclusion this is an excellent piece of cinema and is definitely worth watching.",Conan the Barbarian
185,J5iftY5iveXtreme,Better than what many would think,8,6 March 2010,"Mention ""Conan the Barbarian"" and it isn't hard to conjure up a feeling of all muscles and no brains, and pure campiness. Given that several ""barbarian"" films of the 80s (and even today) are like that, such as 1987's ""The Barbarians,"" one can be forgiven for thinking the same about this John Milius film. I too felt the same, and seeing the sequel ""Conan the Destroyer,"" my notions seemed confirmed. Then I heard praising this film, even calling it one of their favorite movies. Naturally, I was curious, and I happened to catch this on TV.I can say one thing: This is better than I expected.This is by no means a film meant for the Oscars (although there are some Oscar-worthy elements). This is an action flick, and it doesn't try to be anything more than that. What it does try, though, is be an acceptable adaptation of the Robert E. Howard ""Conan"" stories as well as be decent entertainment in general. These efforts do however make this film more of a classic rather than just passable entertainment.The story is simple: Conan's family is killed as a boy; he gets taken into slavery, becomes a gladiator, gets freed, and seeks revenge on the ones responsible for killing his family, eventually succeeding.Okay -- maybe the story isn't so simple. The choice of the Friedrich Nietzsche quote in the beginning is interesting; it makes for a great story theme: strength. Conan, here, through suffering and toil, becomes strong. This is summarized in the concept of ""The Riddle of Steel"": Steel isn't strong -- flesh is stronger.Like the original ""Conan"" pulp stories by Howard, this movie is a part of the ""Low Fantasy"" genre, having magic and sorcery but still taking place in the real world -- in Conan's case, a time period ""between the time when the Oceans drank Atlantis and before the rise of the sons of Arias"" -- so well-said by the narrator, the late Mako.In keeping with this, there is an attempt at being realistic. There is magic and the supernatural, yes, but just enough. For the most part, it tries to portray civilizations and world that could have existed, from their clothing, weapons, architecture, to their way of life. The costumes and sets look great; they truly make the viewer believe he's/she's in some lost time period in our history -- a world so strange, yet so familiar. There isn't a lot of special effects, though. But they are decent for the most part. The scene, though, when the villain Thulsa Doom turns into a snake is convincing, and the choice of back-and-forth shots to show his transformation is clever, avoiding cheesiness.Arnold Swcharzenegger may not be the most phenomenal actor out there; he's no De Niro. But he does, however, have star power, and he has presence in this film. He is just perfect for the role of Conan. He has the right built, the right facial expression -- he truly does look intimidating as Conan. And the role isn't too demanding of his acting abilities.The other principal actors, Gerry Lopez and Sandhal Bergman, are decent. Max Von Sydow is excellent in his brief appearance as King Orsic. Mako is compelling as the narrator and hilarious as the wizard. But the best performance is, without a done, from the legendary James Earl Jones, giving another great performance in just two years after ""The Empire Strikes Back."" His Thulsa Doom is a great villain. What's more, you can truly believe that he's a cult leader.The music for this movie is done by Basil Poledouris. And I. Simply. Have. No. Words. To. Say.The music is just mind-blowing. It is deep, booming, heavy, and just fantastic. It truly does give the film an epic feel. The use of drums gives the film a primitive feel, which is perfect, considering that this is set in a prehistoric time. The use of booming brass instrument, as well as the choirs with their heavy chanting, is extraordinary, sounding aggressive and relentless, the way Conan should be. The softer instruments, such as harps and violins, give Conan a noble, heroic feel.The music, combined with the excellent cinematography (filmed in Spain), creates really excellent results. There are some truly sweeping scenes, such as when the riders raid Conan's village, and his final battle with them. The scene when Conan stumbles upon the ancient tomb and finds the sword is made great because of the music. And the scene when Conan recovers and is practicing with his sword, combined with the softer part of ""The Anvil of Crom"" piece, is one that will linger in your head -- a truly iconic scene.It is the music that truly elevates this movie from a mere action flick in a sea of many to a truly epic film. A classic.This may not be a perfect film (no film is), but compare this to many other 80s fantasy films, and you'll know what I mean.",Conan the Barbarian
186,The_Sun_Toucher,Hindsight is 20/20,7,30 May 2000,"Back when it was originally released, CONAN THE BARBARIAN was dismissed by the critics as a disposable Sword & Sorcery B-movie.  It was criticized for it's excessive violence and Arnold's wooden performance.  It's brilliant score and memorable sets are ignored by reviewers, as is the well choreographed swordplay. Thirteen years later, BRAVEHEART is showered with praise and Oscar respectability.  It is embraced by critics despite it's graphically violent battlefield sequences, which are praised as exhilarating and authentic. Many of these battle sequences (as well as some of the costume design) bare just a little resemblance to the ones in CONAN THE BARBARIAN. Eighteen years later, GLADIATOR becomes a box-office blockbuster in a matter of weeks, taking in almost one hundred thirty million thus far.  It receives generally good notices from critics despite it's historical inaccuracies, poorly edited action scenes and predictable plot.  The basic story is reminiscent to the one told in CONAN, and the films violence is every bit as brutal. Isn't it funny how times change?  What was once laughable and disposable is now respectable.",Conan the Barbarian
187,skradji,Genesis of a Hero,10,23 May 2014,"Well, Conan the Barbarian is everything and by now an icon and undisputed benchmark of the genre of heroic fantasy.There are very , very few persons within the genre films that can overshadow has this , let alone overcome .And is that Conan has something that distinguishes and elevates it above almost all the rest.Y that something for me are mainly two things: the narrative structure and the soundtrack.John Milius gave here a lesson worthy of a master in regards to narrate a history.La film is not slow, it just does not want to go fast , but wants to take his time to explain the birth and physical development and intellectual character .The genesis of the character is clear , and serves to identify with Conan , because who is not able to understand a child who has seen his village destroyed and enslaved the most cruel and brutal way possible , which has seen his father was killed and eaten by a pack of dogs that has finally seen his mother has been beheaded in front of their own eyes.Por that understand and identify with the desire for revenge of Conan and all their actions.No would we do the same?Do not condemn , but to understand and support the character completely in what will be his sweet yet bitter vendetta against those responsible for his misfortune in that great and ruthless world Hyborian .Schwarzenegger was able to give more than the physical and all the charisma needed the character.The other side is simply unbeatable , pointing to a scary and absolutely unforgettable James Earl Jones as Thulsa Doom .And the Soundtrack? . A band of the most beautiful , magical and unsurpassed in the history of cine.That glory're dear Basil.That said, Conan the Barbarian is a masterpiece of its kind, a wonderful film that even 34 years later continues to fascinate as the first time we saw her .",Conan the Barbarian
188,SnorriGodhi,An epic tale of survival and revenge,10,30 May 2006,"People who have never seen ""Conan the Barbarian"" probably expect a sword-and-sorcery movie with a predictable plot, over-the-top action scenes, and pathetic attempts at humor. The reality is very different.This movie is a statement about two fundamental human values: survival and revenge. In Western society, we can hardly appreciate these values, because we hardly ever need to worry about survival, and with the State taking care of justice, we feel little need for revenge. By watching this movie, we get a different perspective. Of course, not everybody will like this movie: I have actually met people who don't. I put it down to people not appreciating how important survival was to our ancestors.Sword-and-sorcery movies, such as ""Conan the Destroyer"", ""Red Sonja"", and ""The Scorpion King"", have nothing to say about survival and revenge: they are too light-hearted (but at the same time their attempts at humor are too coarse). ""Conan the Barbarian"" is closer in feel to ""The Road Warrior"", or ""Escape from New York"", two other movies set in worlds where survival and the rule of law cannot be taken for granted.Another relevant comparison is with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Here the difference is that ""The Lord of the Rings"" is a struggle between Good and Evil, while ""Conan the Barbarian"" is a struggle for survival (and revenge).While the movie is not very realistic, it feels much more ""real"" than the sequel. Apart from a bit of sorcery, which does not affect the plot, there is nothing glamorous about the life story of Conan. It seems strange that somebody who grows up pushing a wheel ends up with a well-proportioned Schwarzenegger physique: how can you develop your biceps muscles if you always push? However, I was not too bothered by this flaw.Arnold's acting is (to put it mildly) less than brilliant. Still, this is not a drawback: how articulate do you expect Conan to be, when he grew up as a slave? Speaking of which, R.H. Howard purists often complain that the ""real"" Conan would never be a slave. However, the movie would be much poorer if Conan did not have some real hardship to take revenge for.There is no question that visuals and music play a big role in this movie. I have been listening to the soundtrack a few times a week for nine years, and it is better than Prozac.Yet dialog (or rather, monologue) also has its moments. There are a couple of intriguing speeches, by Conan's father and by Thulsa Doom; but the most stirring monologue is Conan's first and only prayer, delivered just before the crucial Battle of the Mounds. The philosophy that transpires from this prayer is pretty straightforward: nobody will remember if we were good men or bad, but people will remember if we were brave; revenge is what Conan most cares about; and if his gods won't help him, then he'll help himself.",Conan the Barbarian
189,dreenphlanger,One of the greatest movies ever made,10,20 October 2016,"The movies that I can watch over and over again are very rare. Those movies have such story and such atmosphere, that each time I see them they only get better and better. Conan the Barbarian undoubtedly belongs to that category.It is one of the first movies I have ever watched and, up today, never have I seen such a powerful atmosphere and such perfect blend of picture and music, where each track so faithfully belongs to its scene. The composer Basil Poledouris really surpassed himself.The story of this movie, while adventure in every respect, gives out the feeling of clear purpose and carries a strong, epic philosophy. The choice of characters is simply flawless. Here, Arnold Schwarzenegger does not play Conan. Here, Arnold Schwarzenegger IS Conan, and no other actor could express that role in such a downright manner. And probably never will.This movie pins me down to the TV screen every time I randomly come across it. And every time that happens I watch it until the end, thinking how great this movie is. I can say that I am grateful that John Milius has made this masterpiece and I believe that Robert E. Howard would be proud to see how inspiring his creation is.",Conan the Barbarian
190,kemicon,Still Holds it's Own After All These Years,9,3 December 2007,"In a moment of undeniable nostalgia I had to rent the DVD for Conan the Barbarian. I had recently seen Conan the Destroyer and was horrified to see that it was even worse than I remembered. So I was a bit nervous that the Barbarian wouldn't live up to my rose tinted memories. Thankfully my concerns were unwarranted as Conan the Barbarian stands the test of time well. Everything from the casting to the art direction is impressive in this movie, quite the feat when you can't rely on CG. The story itself is also nicely paced and tells a lot of the Conan back story. Oliver Stone stated how he expected Conan to be a 12 episode series, it's doubtful they could have kept the quality up but maybe someone will revisit the tale. And this story shall also be told ...",Conan the Barbarian

Did I see the same movie as these other folks?I found ""Conan the Barbarian"" to be painfully slow. Very little happens until the final twenty minutes, and by that point, I was fighting to keep my eyes open. I enjoy trashy, B-films more than the average film fan, so I was surprised at how much I disliked this turkey. The sequel is much sillier and over-the-top, and consequently, much more enjoyable.I get the distinct impression that the filmmakers wanted to distance themselves from the oft-mocked ""sword and sandal"" flicks of earlier decades, so they tried to make this a ""serious fantasy"" film. I think they failed miserably. Way too much drama, way too much romance, and far too little violence.",Conan the Barbarian

196,wda779,Surprisingly the best of it's genre. Seriously.,9,22 February 2009,"Conan the Barbarian is probably the last film people think of when trying determine the best Sword and Sorcery movie, but by God it should be right up there with LOTR, Willow, and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. It is in many ways, believe it or not, more satisfying and entertaining than any of those other films and has a much harder edge. Give John Milius some credit for creating a movie that actually feels and looks like it happened thousands of years ago in a dark, mystic, past. The strongest asset this film has are the Villains, played wonderfully by the immortal James Earl Jones, Sven Thorsen, and ex NFL lineman Ben Davidson. These bad muthas crush anyone in their path and have a stranglehold on their world which they re-inforce through sorcery and terror. Conan is also a revenge fantasy movie and one of the best, as we see our hero ruthlessly pursuing his Clan's murderers. Another bright spot is Sandahl Bergman, who plays Valeria, a sword wielding badass who joins Conan on his path to revenge. One of the strongest female characters in any film, Bergman makes Angelina Jolie look laughable as today's top female action star. Surprisingly, this film does not draw much specific material from Robert Howard's Conan stories, yet it somehow stays true to the source. A difficult task and one that is done well by Milius and screen writer Oliver Stone. Lastly there is Arnold, who fills Conan's shoes admirably, though his lines can be counted on one hand. One of the few contradictions to the source material is that in the stories, Conan is actually quite intelligent and nimble in conversation. In the film, (most likely due to Arnold's inexperience at this time) Conan says very little, and accomplishes more through his brute strength than through guile. Yet, once again it stays true to the character somehow. I would recommend this film to anyone that likes to be teleported to another time and place when they see a movie, which is what you get here. Filmed in Spain, the cinematography is gorgeous and the set-pieces are mind blowing. It is such a shame that the sequel, Conan the destroyer, is so terrible. Otherwise this movie would get a lot more attention as well as the credit it deserves for being a superbly entertaining and well made film.",Conan the Barbarian
197,rehams,One of a kind warrior epic,9,16 June 2016,"Many great reviews have been written already, for one of the best most in depth check out user: tieman64, currently found on the second page. That review has most of the cinematic knowledge, so I will just touch on my personal opinion on this film as a student of European history, myth and pre-history.I watched this film first as a teenager and enjoyed it, mostly for the action sequence and the naked women (this was before easy internet access).Having rewatched it now as an adult, a whole new world opens up. To decry this movie as 'simple' or 'primitive' is really just a reflection of a closed mind or objection to the morality of the film.The fact is that Conan is a brilliant warrior epic straight from the tradition of Beowulf and the Illiad. By 'epic' I mean just that, a timeless story of boy becoming a man through overcoming adversity and the quest for glory and honor, which most of us have somewhere inside.Much can be said about this film to it's credence. The cinematography, the images, the musical score, is really excellent. While it is easy to dismiss this kind of fantasy setting now as cliché, that is only because Conan made this entire genre. In reality, Conan is a beautiful film that is in fact quite realistic in its portrayal of pre-history Europe, Iron-Age Europe, just on the dawn of civilization.Through Conan's adventures, he encounters Mongol warlords, walled cities and Oriental snake cults. Each presented with great props and settings. No doubt Conan is a visual and musical masterpiece. I'd actually rank it close to some of Bergman's in its natural harsh setting.Conan is an epic which will resonate deeply in some and repel others. That is so by design. The film is a literal embodiment of some of Jungs archetypes. It's also a rare film in the sense that it would never be made the way it was made today. It takes itself too serious, and therefore is too scary for today's PC Hollywood. There is humor yes, but Conan is not meant as a laughing stock, it is meant quite literally as the triumph of the European man over the barbary of the ancient death cults of the Levant (see Baal, Moloch).I'll end this review and recommend anyone with a real interest in cinema watch this again as adults. The irony of this film is that while it is derided as primtive, it actually requires historical and philosophical knowledge to even remotely be able to fully appreciate.",Conan the Barbarian
198,TreeOfWolf,Wow... they don't make movies this good anymore.,8,26 August 2016,"The remake was so bad that I got weary of the sexism and dropped it. But this old movie got me fascinated to the end.There is more depth in silent stares than many lines I've heard in recent movies. It was poetic. It's brutal, but that allowed a profound beauty.A child forced into slavery ends up discovering how precious is freedom, friendship... and love.I was impressed that they had a strong woman who was an equal to the lead male 30 years ago. The newer version was too disrespectful to be entertaining.The villain is African so it's also respectful of different races. It's a strong role, not some goofy stupid guy who gets killed right after the movie starts. The actor did Darth Vader's voice... It's as epic as you would expect. I got genuinely impressed and intimidated. He had grandiose plans to basically become a god... crushing everything in his path... not some neurotic guy who seem to have taken too much cocaine and be out of control... He was calm, calculated, assertive... freaking scary.Arnold was a father figure for me growing up, so there was an emotional attachment that made me enjoy this movie on a deeper level... I expected some brute waving his sword mindlessly... but it was so much more. So much thoughts and emotions. He tasted rock bottom before rising to the top... He gained his strength from being abused as a slave, so it gave him humility and compassion. He had simple goals but accomplished grandiose things in the process. He wanted revenge to be safe and to help one person... but he ended up liberating a lot of people. He struggled every steps of the way, tortured almost to death... his superior strength wasn't enough to guarantee victory... but he managed to get back up, thanks to the help of his loved ones, and persevered... until he succeeded... That's a great lesson to learn.30 years later, that movie didn't feel old, but like the film makers properly showed an old barbaric era. I was captivated by how much meaning and events they managed to put in a short movie, how much was understood from silence... A movie should be more than action scenes, and it still had plenty of those, but the victories felt earned after struggles, instead of a big violent blur.I was touched that he kinda stole the most precious stone in the land... to offer it to the woman who helped him, letting her know that she's even more precious to him. He didn't boss her around, he didn't demean her, he didn't try to crush her with his strength and take whatever he wanted by force... he appreciated her strength and her kindness after having known such misery... he wouldn't threat her like his slave now that he had the chance to be on top. He was so gentle and loving... only brutal when he was forced to retaliate against brutality... All the characters have more depth than they seem... The movie touched my heart on many unexpected levels.The people who made the remake should go watch that old version and face palm themselves in shame. They failed as a Conan movie, they even failed as a movie. But that one is an eternal classic.Don't be afraid to enjoy old things... sometimes we must look back to make sure that we're not losing precious values in the name of progress.",Conan the Barbarian
199,account-184-125611,"Pretty good, wish it had a different cast though",7,25 January 2015,"Yes, we have to remember this is a movie from the early 80s. Also, the original stories, written for pulp magazines, weren't exactly deep, yet Conan and his stories still are beloved all around the world - for a reason. Howard was able to dream up a quite believable world, full of myths and secrets, a dangerous place to be in. And he dreamed up a character that was more than just a brute. He wasn't running around in a loincloth 24/7, and he used his brains just as much as he used his fists. He was cunning, ironic, funny, and definitely not a mere brute.While this movie does a good job (considering its age and the era it was made in) at showing us a world quite similar to what is described in the stories.However, what kills it for me is Schwarzenegger. While he physically surely is able to portray a barbarian, with a very muscular and well-toned body, his accent, the bland look on his face and the totally emotionless delivery of lines make Conan look like some grinning, stupid mountain of muscles, which does NOT do the stories justice at all. I am sorry, I know Arnie polarizes a lot, and I guess there is a certain ""trademark"" thing he has with the accent etc, but he surely makes Conan look totally sad here. As much as I think the recent remake (from 2011, I think?) was pretty much a failure regarding acting and plot, the Conan in that movie seemed to have at least a tiny bit of intelligence, slyness and wit. This movie has its moments, and I wish they could do another remake with some of THIS movies atmosphere plus a less ""hur hur I beat you to a pulp, puny little man"" type main character, but an actor who is able to portray Conan better - as someone who was a powerful fighter, yet also a smart, cunning man.",Conan the Barbarian

Conan may not speak very much, but when he does his words will knock you out of your chair!  This movie packs more testosterone than anything else ever made.

202,ralf_nader,"Pretty good, has that classic feel to it",6,7 December 2007,"I was going to give this movie a 5, but recognizing that it's about 25 years old, I gave it a bonus point. I think a lot of people gave this a higher rating also because of the nostalgia factor. I never saw this as a kid though...Plot: B+, it's supposed to be the classic tale of Conan the Barbarian, so you basically know what to expect (although I heard this movie doesn't follow the real story exactly). I would say there was some room for a twist or two, but hey, it was good overall.Acting: C, some of the acting is good, but some of the lesser quality actors brought it down a bit. I think Conan's partners could be blamed for a lot of this. Not to say Arnold is the greatest actor ever, but he fit the role well, and I thought he did a good job.Character development: B, Conan was well done. You start off seeing Conan as a child, and you see him through the different stages of his life to the point he becomes Conan the Barbarian. He doesn't talk much, so I'm sure it was a challenge for the writer/director to really improve this aspect of the movie. The other characters seem more static unfortunately.Special effects: B, I have to be fair here. It's a 25 year old movie, so I can't expect amazing computer graphics and true-to-life sound effects. For the time the movie was made, I would say the effects are pretty good.The best aspect of the movie: The movie has a real ""classic"" feel to it. If you saw this movie back when it came out, and you saw it again recently, it probably brought back nostalgic memories.The worst aspect of the movie: Some of the lame lines from the characters just made you wonder what the director was thinking.

This is the film that truly defines a ""Dungeons and Dragons"" movie.  It is the ultimate fantasy film of swords and sorcery(until Lord of the Rings which comes out next year).  This film does have many flaws, mainly lame dialogue, but the film is still superb.  It's a fun movie, and that's what it is all about. Arnold portrayed Conan perfectly.  He may not be a true Oscar winning performer, but he is so likeable that many ""legendary"" actors will not be as remembered or admired in the future as he most likely will.  He barely speaks in the film and portrays Conan with mainly body language and facial expressions perfectly. James Earl Jones is terrific as well.  In this movie we see one of the greatest villains in movie history ever!  He is so sick and evil, that his facial expressions make my hair stand on end.  This is a character who truly believes he is helping the world through black and Satanic rituals and the plundering of peaceful settlements. When it comes down to it, this is a movie full of action, sword fighting, wizardry, beautiful cinematography, a stiring soundtrack, romance and heroism which any adventure film freak could watch over and over.

CONAN has long been my favorite sword movie, still is in a way, but i guess nothing can compete with THE LORD OF THE RINGS saga(though made ca 20 years later). other titles worth mentioning are BRAVEHEART, HIGHLANDER (the first),DRAGONSLAYER(also pretty dark) and THE 13TH WARRIOR(though a bit disapointing).*really hope that john milius consider making the next conan movie(if the deals aren´t already made)",Conan the Barbarian

211,planetp,Best Action-Adventure movie ever made.,10,7 July 2000,"Beyond all the wonderful things that can be said about this film and one of the best movie scores ever, Conan the Barbarian contains many layers of subtlety often overlooked.  Near the beginning of the film, Conan looses his parents to Thulsa Doom.  This shock leaves him extremely vunerable and you could say re-imprints Thulsa Doom as his father who then shortly thereafter sells him into slavery.  This instills him a tremendous degree of rejection and rage towards Thulsa and a subsequent quest for revenge or re-demption. This is why when Conan approaches Thulsa at the end of the film with the intent of killing him, Thulsa points out rather poignantly that who would Conan be if it wasn't for him.  That Thulsa gave Conan all these desires, that without these desires Conan would not be the person he is - strong and powerful.  Conan hesitates to kill Thulsa with the truth of Thulsa statement, realizing that ina way Thulsa has played a father-type significance in his life.  But shortly Conan trancends his childhood programming iniatiated by Thulsa as well as the current hypnotic trance Thulsa puts on him and kills Thulsa - thus ending the cycle of revenge, pain, suffering and the ability for Thulsa to continue his evil on the world.",Conan the Barbarian

How it launched Arnold Schwarzenegger's career I will never know. After this rotten piece of celluloid it's a miracle he wasn't consigned to the acting equivalent of the black pit of despair. I'm not sure where to start really. The cast does include a number of top actors, such as Max von Sydow and James Earl Jones but they are wasted. They really could be anybody. They struggle with the leaden dialogue and the impressive but utterly ridiculous costumes.The dialogue is an interesting point because the screenplay would probably fit on the back of a beer mat. Exposition is deemed a waste of time and large sections of the film are almost silent. I'd like to think this was an executive decision to avoid Arnie's poor English being exposed but I think it might just be dire scripting. When characters do speak, you rather wish they hadn't. The lack of exposition from the characters mean that (with things happening seemingly for no reason due to absurd plotting) you are quickly left with no idea of what is actually happening.The other point is that the wretched thing is so long. It goes on and on and really, if you don't leave the room repeatedly, it's my duty to warn that you might find yourself losing the will to live.

Still several years later not only did i buy it on VHS but i also got the DVD and Blu-Ray versions (will get the 4k version when out - is it out yet?). Why you ask? Because for me Conan is a masterpiece, period. As many others have pointed out in their reviews this is probably the first movie (along with Predator) to give me goosebumps and in more than just one scene.
Granted Arnold may not be 100% like the Conan of the comics but he's a lot closer to that than let's say Momoa (mainly due to his psysique).
James Earl jones reminds everyone why his voice was used for one of the most iconic villains of all times (Darth Vader) and does not dissapoint one bit.
Action scenes are impressive and well orchestrated, visual effects are ok (remember, this wasn't a high-budget movie) but what really stands out is the audio score made by Basil Poledouris which i still listen to quite often.
Now i would had liked it if Arnold didn't smile as much in the movie (he does quite a bit during his training montage early in the movie) since he's a Cimmerian (so he will not cry - laughing feels the same) but what's done is done.

This is his best movie along with the first Terminator. Even if the story isn't very subtle it transcribes R. E. Howard stories. The landscapes are splendid and Poledouris' music ties the film together, possibly better than the soundtrack of any other movie. The minor characters are great, especially Subotai, the Wizard (Mako) and King Osric played by the great Max Von Sydow. James Earl Jones does a great job as Thulsa Doom. This movie has such a feel to it that, in my opinion, it beats The Lord of the Rings hands down. The opening scene with the charge of Thulsa Doom's cavalry on Conan's village gives you a good idea of what this movie is going to be like : Epic!

222,joshuawood2012,A Mixture of Good and Bad,7,20 July 2013,"Conan the Barbarian is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie based off a comic book, which I have never read. This movie starts with a monologue about steel which is neat and is referenced to a couple of times later in the movie. We are then introduced to a young Conan living with his family in a tiny little village. Raiders led by the powerful villain Thulsa Doom. Young Conan is spared and used as slave labor, where he grows up into body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conan, now a cloud-like adult, is sold into a gladiatorial arena and learns to fight. He soon escapes and proceeds on his journey. This section of the movie features limited dialogue and large amounts of violence and gore, although the gore is very fake. Conan travels far and meets a witch. The witch seduces him and we get to watch them have graphic sex with lots of, um, noises. Conan, however, soon gets tired of witch wench and throws her into a fire, killing her. This is all fun, and Conan leaves a happy man. He meets a friend, who happens to be a thief, steals something from Thulsa Doom's snake cult, and meets the love of his life. He then has graphic sex with the love of his life. The three of them go out on an adventure to take down Thulsa Doom and his evil snake cult. They even meet Max von Sydow playing a king whose daughter was kidnapped by Thulsa Doom. They eventually hunt down Thulsa Doom, with the help of the narrator, a wizard. That brings me to the subject of the villain. In a gore and sex filled cheesy movie that marks one of Arnold's first big American movies, you have James Earl Jones himself as the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom we've talked so much about. James Earl Jones actually gives a memorable, credible performance as the villain. It was rather surprising actually. Thulsa Doom is a frightening villain who uses sorcery and honeyed words to gather completely devoted followers to his cause. The rest of the movie consists of Conan and his friends hunting, and eventually killing, Thulsa Doom. Along the way, Arnold's lover dies, Arnold is crucified on the Tree of Woe, dies, is resurrected, and lights a tower on fire with a perfect throw of a torch. That's about it. It is worth mentioning, however, that the scene where Conan wreaks his revenge on Thulsa Doom is very entertaining, and worth the rest of the movie to see.",Conan the Barbarian

Hadn't noticed that.) And it's filled with stirring moments like where Conan prays to Crom. Arnie is perfect as is most of the cast. Prob a little cheesy in parts but carried by the rest of the film's pathos.

Despite the low-brow appeal, much of this film is still artfully done. I particularly enjoy the pacing of the scene where Conan and his comrades kill the giant snake in the temple. The eye of the snake as it slowly awakens, set to the haunting temple music, still haunts me to this day! Lots of people talk trash about Arnold, but honestly, he was perfect for this role. His accent only adds to the barbaric qualities of our protag, Conan! James Earl Jones as Thulsa Doom is NOT TO BE MISSED! Those of the hippie persuasion be warned! This movie was partially written by Oliver Stone, and he lays waste to the hippie myth! Thulsa Doom's followers are the naive and foolish flower children, many of them sons and daughters of the nobility, who have been tricked into believing in 'nothingness.' One might make the case that this film inaugurated the backlash against the sixties, arriving as it does on the cusp of the eighties and the Reagan era! The excesses of the sixties become the fodder for our ridicule in this 'little gem' of a film...The cannibalistic orgy rites of the cultists will particularly shock (or titillate) the uninitiated! Sensitive (read 'homosexual') cultists are also thrashed (actually beaten) by Mr. Conan, so be warned -- this is not a film for the politically correct or faint-of-heart...If you are into swords and sorcery, I heartily recommend this film! If you are into high-brow social commentary, you might be offended, so don't bother!",Conan the Barbarian

228,axelfinnur,A must see for every Schwarzenegger fan,7,3 March 2019,"From the opening I liked this one. There is a real sense for adventure something that can be hard to find.My only problem is the ending and how long it is, for I think it becomes to long for it's own good.",Conan the Barbarian
229,StrayLiteFocus,Hyborian Age in an Alternate Universe,7,6 March 2004,"This is by far the best ""Sword and Sorcery"" film produced to date.  Being a Robert E. Howard fan years before this film was made I have to say I liked it and I hated it.  Accounting for these plusses and minuses I give this film a rating of 7 out of 10; mainly because one of the positives is extremely positive.The extremely positive factor is the musical score by Basil Poledouris which I believe to be one of the finest musical scores ever to grace the silverscreen.Other things tip the scale toward the positive, too.Milius is a gifted filmmaker who pays homage to my favorite director of all time, Akira Kurosawa and relies heavily on visuals to show the film's story turning to the captivating voice of James Earl Jones, playing the antagonist, only when narrative exposition is absolutely required.  This is a wise decision since the cast is mostly green.  The aforementioned Jones is the only veteran actor in a key role although Max von Sydow and William Smith are good in their cameo roles as King Osric and Conan's father respectively.Milius also pays homage to the stunning art of Frank Frazetta in the costumes/sets and scatters ""Howard moments"" throughout the film; such as the scene where Conan beds a witch taken from a Bran Mak Morn tale titled ""Worms of the Earth"", sneaky thievery reminiscent of ""The Tower of the Elephant"", Conan's crucifixion from ""A Witch Shall be Born"", and Valeria (a name from ""Red Nails"") returns from the grave to protect Conan evoking Belit, the ""Queen of the Black Coast"".The film's ultimate treatment of Robert E. Howard's Hyborian Age tips the scale back in the negative direction, though.Milius paints the Cimmerians as a peaceful agrarian culture while Howard's Cimmerians are strong, grim and war-like.  Milius provides a history of a young Conan that completely contradicts Howard's.The Milius Conan is sold into slavery at a tender age after seeing his parents brutally murdered while Howard's Conan apparently never even had a tender age; born on a battlefield and respected by the Cimmerian war council when he was not yet fifteen years old.Howard's treatment of the character Black Turlough who was tossed into a snow-drift at birth ""to test his right to survive"" in ""The Dark Man"" is an indication of how Conan may have actually been raised in Howard's Hyborian Age Cimmerian culture.  Black Turlough is Gaelic and Howard's Cimmerians are the direct ancestors of Gaels in Howard's fictional essay ""The Hyborian Age"".This film must be a Hyborian Age in an alternate universe since contradictions between the Howard Conan and the Milius Conan cannot be resolved.",Conan the Barbarian
230,scootser-1,Heads roll,8,18 October 2008,"Filled with gore and nudity, Conan the Barbarian captures the spirit of Conan perfectly. Schwartznegger shines in his role of a crude man out for revenge and I cannot imagine anyone else performing the same role. His acting even pulls some emotional strings which is very unusual from him. Even with some corny and outdated special effects this film is extremely beautiful to look at. Conan riding through the steppe in a fantasy setting has something that not many movies have been able to top.The plot is solid and clear. Even though it is basically a straight forward tale of revenge, the plot incorporates many unusual turns of events and does not hide the barbarity of the character or the world that he lives in. Supporting characters are really well fleshed out and you come to care about them instead of wishing to see them die in a spectacular manner. The only real downside of Conan is poor dubbing. None of the lines said on screen fit the characters' mouth movement perfectly which gives the film a somewhat campy form.I do not understand why Conan the Barbarian has only 6.7 rating on IMDb since it cannot be boring to anyone and it is certainly seen in good light by the more attentive film goers. This is easily one of the best movies of the 80s and deserves whatever praise it gets. If you haven't seen this classic already I recommend you see it before you die.",Conan the Barbarian
231,balsarius,"Conan, forget 2011 ever happened:",10,10 April 2018,"Conan was my first epic S&S movie experience. I can still hear my Dad saying: ""Hide your eyes, boy!"", during the naughty parts. He was one for the parental discretion. As a result, I grew up well adjusted, and we have a great man-to-man relationship in my adulthood.Conan the Barbarian, is like a teleportation into the canvases of Frank Frazetta's art. It is the best movie on the, Robert E. Howard, character and world of the Hyborian Age.This movie injected me into literature at 11 years old, and I found something strange occurred I have yet to experience in any other novels I have read.In those books I had to struggle to imagine a concept that when realized on film, often never lived up to my own mind's visual.With, Howard, I didn't have that dilemma. I could see Conan and many of his companions. I could see, smell, and hear the settling without a need to imagine beyond the scope I had seem already.As a man, I watch it often and it is a cinematic masterpiece. Brutally honest, gender serving for both sexes, and visually perfect for fans of, Howard. The effects are not over the top, and believably done. The blood splashing is iconic, and Johnathan Earl Jones, is as great in this as Star Wars.Not to be missed in life. This is, Conan, as nothing after it measures up.The 2011 remake made me think they were just trying to sell a climactic Play Station ending for the game they'd release on the title.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is in top form in a film that catapulted him into the stratosphere and a year later he would go onto star in the Terminator, cementing his arrival as leading man. Milius is such a good director and it seems war and moral codes are running through his veins. The cinematography is good as is the score and one scene in particular- the kitchen orgy sequence is awe inspiring in its outlandish transpiring.

233,Doomdark,Groundbreaking in the Fantasy genre.,10,26 February 1999,"""Conan the Barbarian"" is in my opinion the earliest Fantasy movie made that is worthy of the name.

In itself, this might not say much, but I think that Conan the Barbarian manages to capture the special atmosphere of Robert E. Howards works' very well.

It is great in that you could not make a better movie about Conan.  Arnold is perfect for the part with his early '80s steroid-enhanced size and thick Austrian accent.  The plot is silly but action-packed; the characters are interesting; and there are so many macho/corny lines that stick with you afterwards.  Almost every male my age (born in 1969) that I've talked with loved this movie and, even more than the movie, the music - the score is memorable and is perfectly suited to the picture and action.

The director and cinemtographer should be commended, they produced some incredible effects especially considering the year this came out and the genre of the movie. However, the gratuitous nudity and gore somewhat cheapen the film, though I guess I can forgive them for it. All in all, this movie is definately worth watching, and fans of action/fantasy will probably love it.

The adventure just gets juicier from there. As we follow a journey filled with lust, jewels and bloody vengeance, we find it hard not to root for our moralless hero and his comedic companions killing time and anyone who gets in their way. And perhaps this is due to the colorfully detailed portrayal of life on the open road sometime after the sinking of Atlantis and before the rise of the sons of Aryas. Maybe Conan the Barbarian is sort of like Mad Max in that it conjurers up our nostalgia for times just out of reach and freedom from the confines of our modern society.",Conan the Barbarian
239,Hurdy_Gurdy_Man,Now THIS is an EPIC.,9,28 July 2013,"Had heard about this for years but never got an opportunity to view it before now. Turned out to be slightly different from my expectations. It turned out not to have a well-defined plot but more a series of random incidents - at least in the beginning - which somehow lead the protagonist to the ultimate confrontation as if destiny has preordained it. There is also an emphasis on minimal dialogue which works in the film's favour by reducing clunky exposition and making it more of an action-packed visual spectacle. And of course Arnie is not the most lucid English speakers around so it's good that he has so little dialogue.The film is full of gorgeous scenery and production design. II found it to be very different from the usual medieval fantasies - a lot more animalistic and primal, to be exact: notice the heads of animals carved on the ends of each of the arms of the Wheel of Pain and also the snakeskin-like outer walls of the Tower of Serpent.A lot of people have lamented that Conan is made out to be a buffoon which clashes with the source writings. I did not consider it to be a problem within the film. Had Conan had a normal childhood with his parents by his side, there was a chance that he would have turned out to be an erudite and well-balanced individual. But this was not to be. He was forced into slavery and isolation at first and mindless fighting machine later. Doubtless his social skills would not have had much chance to develop. Once free, he passes through the world with a wide-eyed countenance which lends an aspect of apparent buffoonery in some people's eyes.That doesn't mean that there isn't a lot of hilarity and weirdness in the film. The camel-punching scene is, of course, legendary but there are plenty other moments in the film. Why was Conan freed? Why were dogs set upon him afterward? Every time Conan sees something inexplicable, all he can manage to say is, ""Crom!"" in an awed voice as if it is a final, irrefutable explanation of things. Thulsa Doom and the wizard also provide plenty of entertainment with their restless, manic behaviour.Thulsa Doom's temple reminded me strongly of Col. Kurtz's compound in Apocalypse Now. Since Milius was involved in both films, the connection is intentional, I guess.Max von Sydow appears in only one speaking scene. The lines he is given are not exactly top-class but it is a proof of his brilliance that he makes them sound so good. In the hands of a lesser actor the performance would have been cringe-inducing.All in all, I loved every bit of it. Basil Poledouris's magnificent score towers above everything. It takes its time in setting up the characters and their dilemmas instead of rushing into it in a workmanlike fashion, which was what the sequel did.",Conan the Barbarian

The answer is yes, even better than I recall. The artistry (implying a beheading instead of showing it, with excellent musical score and even quality child acting) is unheard of in modern cinema. The musical score is incredibly appropriate for this film and really sets the bar to be matched for any sort of sword & sorcery movie. If one were to purchase a Conan replica sword and heft it there is no doubt the main theme would be running through you head when doing so! Regarding the acting, costumes, set pieces, etc - it seems to fit the film well and carries a certain charm that has stood the test of time. My biggest gripe with Arnold is the odd grunts of pain that Conan makes constantly during the pit fighting scene and a couple other times in the film. Fortunately this role didn't have a lot of dialog but did require a massive/imposing individual - which a Mr. Olympia can fill nicely. There is a lot to like in this movie even decades later and it now acts as a poster child for the power of a musical score to elevate a film to greatness. 8 Stars, five of which come from the soundtrack alone.",Conan the Barbarian

I'm really not a huge Arnold fan, but he was perfect in every way for the role, in my opinion. I think the character fits him better than anything else he's ever played.

248,Whackooyzero,A fun but flawed action fantasy movie.,7,26 August 2010,"Conan The Barbarian is one of those movies like The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Highlander that for one reason or another has a rather large cult following but the majority of critics find despicable. When watching Conan I found I was kept entertained the whole way through, but under real analysis the movie isn't really that good.I won't spoil the plot for you but it's relatively simple. Just a basic ""villain kills protagonist's father, protagonist grows up in harsh conditions and fights back"" basically. Sure there is a bit more to it then that but nothing that particularly great. However I will say that the few twists in the film keep it entertaining. Conan played by the now legend Arnold Schwarzenegger is the first in the movie's flaws. The character has basically no personality in this adaptation(though to be fair he was never exactly a greatly personified character in the first place) besides being a brute, and Arnold's acting is laughable at this point.Then you have Valeria played by dancer Sandahl Bergman(who admittedly has a pretty nice body but is ultimately boring and unimpressive). She's a bit better at acting(and her character has a tad bit more personality: she's smart, tough, but also sensitive) but that's not saying much not to mention the way they show her personality is rather clumsy, and the sidekick Rexor played by Ben Davidson leaves no impression. The only other real players in the movie are Mako as Akiro the wizard and narrator(who is very entertaining in a campy way here) and James Earl Jones as Thulsa Doom(who delivers the only genuinely good acting performance in the movie).So that's how the cast and acting fares: Relatively wooden and uninteresting. But what about the action? After all, the only real reason to watch this movie is the action sequences and they are all top notch. In fact, the reason this movie is so much fun is simply because of 4 factors: The action, the music(some of the best in an adventure film), the visuals(and effects), and the simple story(which is simple but keeps you excited and interested the whole way through). The movie delivers the goods in that way because all the action is remarkably well executed and exciting(made only more so due to the charging orchestral score), and the sets and costumes are great to look at.I've read a couple of places where people have tried to say this movie has some kind of religious message about the crusaders and such, and though I suppose you could read into it enough to see that I personality don't think that was intended. In the end the movie is just a basic sword and sorcery movie that entertains on the basic action and technical level but fails for the most part on the dramatic end. It'll entertain you, but it's likely the movie could've done more.I should also add the majority of the women in this movie are portrayed as sexual objects with no personality, so if that really bothers you(and it did bother me a little) you may want to steer clear of this movie I don't know but if you are in the mood for mindless action packed fun you could do a lot worse than this.",Conan the Barbarian
249,cyberray1976,My All-Time Favorite Movie,10,25 November 2004,"WOW! What can I say about ""Conan the Barbarian"" that I haven't said about it in the past 22 years? In my opinion IT'S THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER PUT ON THE SILVER SCREEN and definitely Arnold's best movie. Ya see, I was seven (I think) when I went with my parents and saw it at the movies for the first time. From that point on, it has been my favorite movie of all time.Now, not only am I a big Conan and Arnold fan, but a big Sword/Sorcery/Fantasy movie fan as well. I have seen it probably thirty times and will never get tired of seeing it. Arnold was born to play the role of Conan. Everyone in the movie truly delivers 110 percent. The story and plot are solid, the fight scenes are well done (and bloody), the characters are interesting and likable, the props and scenery are great looking, the score by Basil Poledouris is AWESOME, and the movie just has a feel to it that I feel most movies lack today. A feeling that the movie is really authentic and the actors in the movie are the real thing and not just actors. You can really lose yourself in these characters. James Earl Jones plays a truly despicable villain called Thulsa Doom and Max Von Sydow plays the aging and tired King Osric brilliantly. Another thing I liked about it was that it was rated 'R'! This was one thing I did not like about the sequel among others reasons. It's not a light hearted depiction of the character and it doesn't have that ""family"" feel to it like the sequel has. Conan is not a character that should be portrayed and taken lightly. The director lives up to the character and the world he lives in he shows that it's not a pretty and friendly place. It truly has that Robert E. Howard feel to it. If Mr. Howard were alive today, I think he's be truly proud to see his greatest character done so brilliantly and beautifully portrayed. Very true to the original character of the old pulp stories and novels. Anyway, if you like sword,sorcery, and fantasy type movies and haven't seen Conan the Barbarian,GO RENT AND SEE IT!!! Better yet, go buy it! You will love this movie! Just be cautious about the sequel but that is another review!!!",Conan the Barbarian

251,jrcarney52,Conan the Barbarian: Film Sword and Sorcery at its Best,10,11 June 2008,"The epic cinematography, the low-tech special effects, the beautiful sets, and the well-paced narrative make this film brilliant. Based upon the character created by Robert E. Howard--quite possibly the greatest pulp fiction writer in the 30s--the movie recreates the nihilistic and hopeless aesthetic the writer's stories and the Sword-and-Sorcery--are so famous for. In the world of Sword and Sorcery and Conan, the Gods are indifferent, and often sadistic. They laugh at our tribulations, and think no less of gobbling up a mortal than we do of slaughtering a head of cattle. Although life is short and terrible in Conan's world, the noble and powerful still insist on living it.John Milius and Oliver Stone's screenplay as well as Milius's directing rendition capture the feeling of timelessness and hopelessness of the genre. Mako, the actor who plays the strange coast-wizard and narrator, has a wonderful voice for the genre, and it matches perfectly with the screenplay composed by Basil Poledouris. James Earl Jones's creates an intriguing, mythic, and unique character out of the cult-leader Thulsa Doom. No actor has made silence more emotive than Schwarzenegger does in this film. The entire cast and production team seemed to be a rare and happy miracle.I remember being a little kid, probably in 89, listening to the beginning drumbeats of the theme song, and then hearing, ""Between the time the ocean drank Atlantis and the rise of the Sons of Aryas..."" and literally having the hair on the back of my neck stand up. There are numerous great lines, particularly Conan's answer to the question, ""What is good in life?"": ""To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women. "" And the dialog in general, married with the strategically utilized silences, force the viewer to reflect on the iconic shots: Conan, sitting over a fire eating meat with a friend; Conan, meditating on the death of Thulsa Doom; Conan, trudging onward on the wheel of pain.Today my appreciation of the movie comes from the extent to which it truly recreates the aesthetic and feeling of the Sword and Sorcery genre, and also the raw and immediate power of low-tech special effects over today's--I sound like an old man--flashy computer graphics. Sure, when Conan hacks off Thulsa Doom's head and tosses it down the steps of the Mountain of Power, the bloody prop looks kind of fake. But it initiates my imagination in a way CGI never will be able to.",Conan the Barbarian

It is a sword and sorcery epic which, unlike many such films since, is very good viewing.Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as Conan. He plays Conan as a tough warrior in a tough world. He does not try be funny, unlike in many of his films later. This is where he really succeeds.The music, by Basil Poledouris, is also one of the contributors to the film's success. The two scores at the beginning of the fim, ""The Anvil Of Crom"" and ""Riders Of Doom"", I think are exceptionally good.The amount of sex and violence may not appeal to many people but it is mild compared to many films in 90s.",Conan the Barbarian

254,altanic,Whatever faults this film has are easily forgiven...,8,1 February 2000,"This may not be one of the greatest films of all time, but for fantasy-fans like me it is one of the best fantasy movies ever made.  Fantasy adventure movies should not always be something that you take your kindergartener to go see.  I enjoyed Willow, but this genre is better defined by movies like Conan: The Barbarian, than by any ""Muppet's Go Medieval"" type of movie.The movie is far from perfect.  People can easily point to the dialogue and say ""5 out of 10.""  But I always viewed Conan as a grunting, heavily accented kind of guy anyways. :)  I would have been skeptical had he come out with some theological sermons or preaching about the rights of the weak and poor.  Arnold does a good job.  And besides, he looks so much like a real Conan that by looking at him you gotta believe that's how Conan talks... 'cause Arnold is Conan!!!Some have complained about the plot.  I think the plot is fine, although of course it's not meant to be picked apart and rigorously, mathematically tested.  It's a great story.  It offers an explanation of Conan's youth and then applies that history very nicely to the trouble he gets into later on as an adult (I suppose he looks for the trouble himself).I'll admit there are some things that even I would want to see changed if we could dynamically alter the movie now.  I'm sure even the director would agree to a point.  There are a couple of scenes which may not directly affect the main plot, but then again, these should only bother folks who want the story to ""move along"" so they can watch ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Casablanca"" and admire their own good taste. ;-)Bottom line: Conan the Barbarian is the best ""warrior"" movie ever made.  It could have been the start of a nice 2-3 movie saga, had the sequel not been so bad.  I would love to see something similar be made today.  There are more than a few great fantasy stories out there, complete saga's in fact(with swords, magic, terrific evil, great heroes) that in the hands of a good screen-writer and director could make a hell of a movie(s).  And more importantly, I believe it would make a lot of money.Oh well, all I can do is hope that The Lord of the Rings isn't another rated-PG kiddie-fest with funny monsters, silly villains, and comic relief at the end of every scene.

255,Quillmaster,The best Conan film and better of the Sword and Sorcery genre.,8,17 April 2007,"Conan the Barbarian is a vastly under rated film. Compare it to other early titles in the ""Sword & Sorcery"" Genre however, and one can quickly see it deserves a space high on the podium. It is one of the few films in this genre aimed at a more mature audience, with some excellently choreographed fight scenes (including a surprisingly refreshing amount of gore), and very subtle sorcery that comes across as more believable. On reflection, perhaps less subtlety would have improved it, but then again, special effects at the time were a little limited.James Earl Jones gives an excellent performance of Thulsa Doom (who is laughingly referred to as ""Thulsa Boom"" on my DVD cover - kinda ruins the image of a villain *chuckles*). As for Arnold, although some might laugh at his acting, the character fits his skills rather well.The soundtrack is an excellent addition to the movie, doing much to add to the atmosphere of the fight scenes.Definitely the better of the Conan films. While not up to the standards of say Lord of the Rings, I'd still recommend it to anyone interested in this genre.",Conan the Barbarian
256,strapane,Showed Arnold's potential & growth as an actor,9,30 December 2002,"This was the first time I saw Arnold's depth and potential to become a star. Each of his films and performances have grown in complexity and sophistication.  By the time he did Total Recall, he was known more for putting together a block-buster than for his acting, but he continues to develop his characters within the expectation's of his audience. He came to terms with his type casting in Last Action Hero and moved on. I was most impressed by his acting and character development in Collateral Damage [2001] where he played a clever fireman, as far as he could get from the idealized Conan. He relies less on spectacular effects now which Last Days proved couldn't top T-2. I'm also impressed by his story selection more recently which forecasts trends early enough to have a film released when the public is hot on the topic (6th day- Cloning, True Lies & Collateral Damage- Terrorism, etc.).  Starting with Conan he manages to bring out the best in a talented cast, often those not yet well-known, not well-used supporting actors, or those out-of-favor with Hollywood Studios (James Earl Jones, Mako, & Sandahl Bergman here, Vanessa Williams, Tom Arnold, James Cromwell... later).  Terminator-3 [2003] as a story is no more complex than Conan and he doesn't have the muscles he once had. But its success will be in the character development and logical story-boarding of each scene since he never fails to work with a director and screenwriters who produce a first-class film before the cameras roll. I credit Arnold for working with so many talented directors like Conan's John Milius (Apocalyse Now, Magnum Force). Like Shakespeare's prose Arnold's films work for an audience at many levels, and remain tongue in cheek, a formula that started in Conan the Barbarian. I can hardly wait for True Lies 2 [2004].  Finally, Arnold's management skills have developed with each new multi-million dollar movie project. This may come in handy when he moves on to politics & govt. He's come a long way (I can finally understand him) but I recently saw Conan again on TV and it remains a performance of which he can be proud.",Conan the Barbarian

259,Ce_Aqatl,Conan the Magnificent,9,23 January 2007,"Featuring a towering, monosyllabic protagonist, a dark-skinned and dark-hearted villain, a mesmerizing soundtrack by Basil Poledouris (most certainly inspired by Greek Orthodox ecclesiastical chants), the movie bulges with wild, untamed, barbaric strength.Although Conan the Barbarian seems somewhat slow by today's standards, and the plot is rather haphazard for casual viewers, it is much more thought-provoking, immersing and masterfully crafted than most present fantasy films. The writers have taken pains to choose the more flavorful bits out of R.E. Howard stories (finding the Atlantean sword, raiding a wizard's tower, being crucified, receiving aid from the spirit of a deceased lover, etc.), creating a cohesive story that combines common fantasy clichés with complex philosophizing.Conan the Barbarian is a pagan, an agnostic, and a Nietzschean at the same time, a man that trusts only his sword, his strength and his ego. The Cimmerian may seem haughty, selfish, and obsessed with revenge, but his nemesis, the wizard Thulsa Doom, is a paragon of pride. A mixture of a political demagogue, a New Age guru, and a professional hypnotist, this character is a lover of long-winded speeches and a perfect contrast to Conan. The Cimmerian is the power of the steel; the wizard is the power of the flesh. One cannot live without the other, but in the end one shall fall. Conan will have to endure slavery, bloody gladiator combats, travels through the wilderness and personal loss to exact revenge for his parents' death. There have been many fantasy films before and after Conan the Barbarian, but it still beyond comparison. A truly unique movie that has brought together a lot of great and diverse talent (Milius, Schwarzenegger, James Earl Jones, Poledouris...), both a cult classic and a fantasy flick mainstream enough to appeal to a very wide audience. And my personal sentimental favorite: I remember seeing it at a very young age, on post-Soviet Russian TV that cared nothing about R-ratings, political correctness, or copyright. Conan is a character that can change people's lives - and if don't want to live forever as you live today, see this film!",Conan the Barbarian

Thee story and dialog are really damn good. There are so many classic scenes. I got my girlfriend to watch it. She was convinced it was going to be a stupid Arnold muscle movie (it seems almost everyone thinks this) but she loved it.It's such a change to see such an un-ironic passionate movie. I can't see a movie like this being made today. The nudity and violence were great and added realism without ever being flatly gratuitous.Don't see Destroyer though, that was absolutely awful.",Conan the Barbarian

The beautiful music does most of the talking, I don't know how the academy could overlook Basil Poledouris' score, it really deserves an Oscar. Never before and never since has there been a film where the music is this much in sync with the action.  And speaking of the action... WOW! Very bloody, but very entertaining too.",Conan the Barbarian
263,stav,Just.... Brilliant,10,19 June 2001,"I cannot believe this movie had not been inserted in the top 250 movies of Imdb. I searched the database, then the Conan site itself, and the database one more time, but soon realized it was a worthless cause as it obviously was not going to be there with a shocking grade of 6.2. This movie is fantastic for all, especially for all you fantasy, warrior, dreamers out there, such as myself.Conan the Barbarian as a movie can simply be put as brilliant. I'm not going to get into any details that may have some overhauling philosophical outlook throughout the movie, even though there may not be too many, but I just want to bring forth a few pointers...The movie is all fantasy, adventure, and a slight taste of action, all brought into one. Even though there may be a few movies out there that have these same elements, none can be so picturesque and captivating as this. Once seated in front of the screen to watch this epic, (yes, an epic), a person simply cannot budge. While Arnold grows from child to man we too grow our relationship with the Great Oak himself and therefore want to simply watch more. The directing is also brilliant. When Arnold and his ""mates"" run through the barren fields we feel as if though we too are part of that group and are joining in with the great escapade, where at any point we may have to release our double-bladed sword and fight some mercenary warrior...If there was anything I would have to downgrade on it would probably be the scene with the large snake as the snake itself may look rather odd at first. Still, this movie was made quite a while ago, and does not affect the movie - in a direct manner of speaking - in any way. Also I personally would have loved some more blood and gore. As I've mentioned this movie is great for all you fantasy, warrior, dreamers out there, or just if you're looking for a good, enjoyable movie. Just go watch this movie, and then buy it, so you too can wave your battle axe, sword, or any other weaponry in coordination with the musclebound warrior himself, whenever you want to. You can thank me later.5 out of 5.",Conan the Barbarian

I see there are quite a few negative snowflake reviewers here who would prefer some Mary Sue character instead, with a checkbox of wokeness which this movie gladly fails, although it does have a fantastic diverse cast who do not go shoving it down your throat like todays garbage. This is a multi-layered movie, deeper if you really pay attention, its not just what u see is what u get. The dialogue for Arnie was drastically shortened after it was realised he was not fluent in English and also had a thick Austrian accent to boot, so they made him more of a strong silent type. His character and story is basically the sword being. Forged in the opening credits Then there is there is the underlying riddle of steel paced through out till the very end.. A special mention goes for the music too, absolutely love it and compliments and raises this movie further. This movie is not for todays stunning and brave weak pansy minded sheeples, who expect to have everything handed to them on a plate without and graft or growth, which is why I love it even more.

268,sargon999,"Brutal, uncompromising, and invigorating",8,22 November 2002,"In an age of Xena-esque fantasy adventure films (al la the tepid Scorpion King) It is startling to go back and see just how good this movie still is. ""Conan"" is not for the faint of heart, and not just for gore - there are far more bloody movies out there - but for the uncompromising warrior-ethos John Milius infused into his vision.  There is nothing PC about this fantasy world.  When he is asked ""what is best in life?"" Conan paraphrases Genghis Khan: ""Crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their women!"" We are not led to believe he is kidding. It is true that Arnold is no great actor, but it is also true he has always stuck with parts he can handle, and he does a fine job as Conan, but the real star here is the director.  John Milius is one of the greats, totally unappreciated in his time, and his sweeping scope and epic, gritty battle sequences add a dimension lacking from almost every other S&S film. There is a grim aura of doom pervading the movie that fits the original Howard stories to a T, and I think Robert E Howard would have really liked this movie.  James Earl Jones gives a killer performance as the evil Thulsa Doom, rivalling Darth Vader himself. A last point in this film's favor is the score.  Basil Poledouris turned out his best score ever for this film: Brooding, powerful and operatic, it lends the film a grandeur Hercules could only dream of.

270,iohannkn,"By Crom, it STINKS!",1,27 April 2006,"I saw this when it first came out and was shocked even then by the complete failure of the Hollywood hacks who made the film to either put Conan on the screen or even just make a decent movie. Phew. Recently, I tried to watch it again, twenty-odd years later - and I gagged. It's irredeemable. It's on a par with Plan 9. Only it's more boring.Why didn't they READ the books? WHAT were they thinking? Conan was created and made real for readers by a seminal pulp writer, one Robert Ervin Howard, a colleague of Lovecraft and others. He was the man who, in one reviewer's phrase, perfected the supernatural adventure story. Conan was his most popular creation - a taciturn, indomitable, blue-eyed powerhouse - by turns a thug, thief, gang-leader, captain, hero, king. Conan spoke little, did much, and was never beaten. He traveled and strove in a reality that Howard created, a thick, palpable, concrete world, an ancient reality, as though Jack London were writing stories not of Alaska but - with the same grit and vigor - of Ancient Assyria or Medieval France. And better still, to this was added the creatures and world of Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith, the supernatural dimensions of undreamt-of, yawning, Hellboy-style gulfs of pitch-darkness and groping nightmare. Pitted against this, alone, lithe but steel-muscled, was the black-browed Conan.Yet, in the movie, we're presented not with the brooding, taciturn ubermensch who bears that name, but with some long-haired victim who happens to have big muscles. Instead of a smart, strong and infinitely tough young man who never knew a childhood, we get a kind of dumb kid, who is ""growing up"". Instead of a grim Sergio Leone-style loner, we get Goofy.Any one of the good Conan stories would have been a wonderful movie, faithfully made, acted out by real actors, invested with decent special effects, and articulated by artists who KNEW the stories, who KNEW the character and the world they needed to recreate. But no, instead these people neglected the story, sloshed some of the names around, neglected acting, neglected the Conan character itself, and in general gave us a drama-less, plodding, amateur-night fantasy with some fake blood, a fake snake, and James Earl Jones in a wig. It's ""Conan"" in name only, and barely that.A real Conan movie would be part Ben-Hur, part Sword of Doom, part the Hellboy-dimension of elder evil, and crafted with the sincerity that Jackson and company put into Lord of the Rings. That Conan movie, however, is still waiting to be made.",Conan the Barbarian
271,Cactus737,The king of sword movies,10,28 July 2014,"This movie is the best. I feel so sad these new sword and sorcery shows like game of thrones are more like soap operas with no monster barbarians like Arnie. I especially like how Conan and his woman were supposedly so in love but he only says maybe 5 words to her the entire movie. He spends the rest of the movie chopping people to bits, no drama, back stabbing or politics. When he burns his girlfriends body he doesn't even cry so his Asian sidekick has to cry for him. This is what a sword movie should be. It was especially a nice touch at the end when thulsa doom gives his last speech to Arnie and Arnie just has that look on his face for a second like his brain was hurting ... Until it hit him he doesn't think he just chops and that's how it ended with a ""thwack"". They don't make them like they used to =*(",Conan the Barbarian

273,jeffthebarbarian,This is my favorite movie.,10,28 March 2006,"I admit it. Conan the Barbarian is my favorite movie. I don't remember the first time I saw Conan the Barbarian; it was before elementary school. However, this film has stayed with me throughout the years when so many sword & sorcery films miserably miss the mark. Why? First of all, the imagery is beautiful. Unlike Conan the Destroyer, Red Sonja, Kull the Conqueror, and the myriad other fantasy films out there, Conan the Barbarian features beautiful outdoor imagery and sets that were obviously painstakingly created for that dark gritty feel of the written series. The costumes are well done. One sees earth tones prevailing, none of the incredibly silly colors or fabrics seen in the afore mentioned movies. In other words, the costumes don't look cheap. The outside locations were positively beautiful. They filmed outdoor sequences in Spain instead of on indoors set like many films. The range and beauty of the landscapes are stunning. The music is haunting. Basil Poledouris' score is incredibly moving, and, in a film with little dialog, the music helps to move the movie along. As for the script. For a fantasy movie, it is incredibly well written. (Actually, compared to many movies of the late 1990's and early 2000, it is superb in comparison.) They do change Conan from the books though. He is much more honorable in the movie (trust me) than in the books. He is also well taught both in fighting and in learned pursuits (no, he isn't a scholar, but he is literate). Most people think this is a hack and slash movie. Maybe so, but it also has a deep message; revenge does not bring peace. All throughout the movie, Conan searches for revenge for a terrible wrong. However, his quest for revenge costs him dearly...too dearly. In his final scene where he is alone, where does the culmination of revenge lead? It doesn't regain him what he lost, but it was also something that he had to do. However, not all feel about it that way, and that is only the way I choose to view it. The acting is a bit wooden here, at least from our heroes. However, Conan is supposed to be stoic and Arnold's face does capture a wide array of emotions without ever having to speak. Sandhal Bergman does a surprising credible job as Valeria, fellow thief and companion. However, it is James Earl Jones who over powers the audience with his lush voice and expressiveness. As Thulsa Doom, the main villain, he shines. The gore factor here is fair, so you may not want to let your kids watch it. Also, a little bit of nudity is here within as well. Anyway, if you want to see a nice sword & sorcery movie, this is probably one of your best bets. It has a little bit of everything.",Conan the Barbarian
274,Smugglarn,This is the best sword & sorcery film ever and a great film over all.,8,11 February 2002,"This movie is a masterpiece. Visually stunning and groundbreaking at the time, in the way it takes fantasy seriously. Not until Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The (2001) has there been any attempt on this. This is indeed a very visual film. The acting is superb in its minimalism. Most of the dialogue is made trough looks which is very fitting in a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is truly the best performance of his career. All in all, this movie is very much a masculine movie. It captures the very essence in the male persona. The Nietzschean/Darwinian approach with eastern influences depicts a pragmatic and yet a very fantastical approach to life. Everything is possible if you put your mind to it. There is no absolute truth and one should not hasten into condemning something which one knows little of. Conan tries everything once and learns from it. Sometimes he benefits from it and sometimes he gets hurt. But he always learns. ""That which does not kill you makes you stronger"" is truly the essence of this film. It may not be true towards the original books but this movie stands on its own. As Milius said, these movies are not made anymore - a big production which actually can teach you something. For a long time we only have brain-dead blockbusters which are made to sell toys or to make little girls get wet over the latest teen pop-pinup.

He is than given the chance to be free, and he takes it. Que a long, brutal, bloody revenge saga.After about an hour to actually get to the revenge bit the action gets going: And what spectacular action it is.

Many people feel that Arnold Schwarzeneggar is just a meat head and is incapable of making a truly authentic cinema masterpiece. This film proves exactly the opposite.This film set the standards for swords and sorcery films. The combination of directing, script, and acting are what set this apart from other films of the same genre. John Milius was clearly the right person to direct this film. Arnold's performance is also exceptional and his acting in this film is among the top performances he has had. The rest of cast is exceptional as well and met the necessary standards for a film of this caliber. What makes this film so unique and great is that most of the actors are novices with exception to James Earl Jones, Rob Cobb, Mako, and Max Von Sydow. Although the experienced actors have limited rolls, they play important rolls and their performances help support the overall feel to the film. I like this movie because the main actors were all new and worked very hard to create an extremely distinct and true film.For the era and time that this film was produced, the effects that the film had were outstanding. Although there was no CGI at this time, the production crew did a great job creating the giant snake and the transformation sequences with James Earl Jones. I think what made this film so unique was how it was done. I liked the fact that their was very little dialogue from the actors themselves and that the audience was mostly addressed through the voice-over of Mako. This gave the movie a feel that it was a grand story being told to the audience and that we were in essence being read an adult bedtime story.It is extremely difficult to explain how great this film is on such a limiting platform, but I think that once this film is watched, it can then be understood how incredible it truly is.",Conan the Barbarian

What is steel compared to the hand that wields it?"" can be found in Aleksandr Nevskiy. There are also some scenes in Conan (the pilgrimage to the mount of power by example) that remember Eisenstein's 'Ivan Grozny' pilgrimage to call Ivan back to Moscow.

Howard's stories, this film does quite a lot to mix and match the tales, keeping some of the basics and using ideas and dialogue from Howard's created worlds.  The brutality of this film is holding, the wonder of the film awesome, and the film's musical score is captivating and grand.  Too bad the sequel was so lackluster.  This film, however, is a MUST-SEE!",Conan the Barbarian

It was a good movie.. sorry, it was. The lines were memorable, the action was well-choreographed (without the hyper-kinetic, excessive editing of today's films... you can actually see what's going on), and it was true to the source material (Read the source material, kids, this was meant to be simple and straightforward.) And as for the charges that it is self-important or takes itself too seriously, that's the problem with most genre films of late, they don't take themselves seriously as the actors, writers, and everyone involved seem intent on letting the audience know that the film they are presenting is based on source material that, as far as they are concerned, is a joke. The only real blight on ""Conan"" is the fact that it produce a throwaway sequel in ""Conan the Destroyer."" Now, that was garbage.",Conan the Barbarian
290,imdb-5656,A ridiculously overrated waste of two precious hours!,2,1 April 2010,"I won't say much. How this movie has gained such a following, and inspired so many 8, 9 and 10 star reviews is truly beyond me.Having sat through the whole thing, I am left with nothing but puzzlement, and a wish that I had spent my two hours doing something else entirely. What a waste.The acting is mediocre at its best (and I usually like Schwarzenegger, not to mention James Earl Jones). The store is cliché, but okay, that's true of so many movies, good or bad. But it is poorly told, oftentimes not told at all. The scenes are grand, but the props often ridiculously bad, and the effects are laughable. The gore is plentiful, but poorly executed.Don't waste your time, people.. And don't praise the movie just because ""You're supposed to, it's a classic!""

291,UncleUnvoid,An epic fantasy movie about revenge and the power of steel,8,12 November 2005,"There are not that many good fantasy movies out there. There are less of those which really have a depth beyond being a genre movie. This epic movie based on a great literary character, manages to capture the raw and unforgiving atmosphere that make Conan's world in a very breathtaking way. Furthermore, the deep philosophical themes of revenge in the form of Conan's quest to kill Tulsa Doom first trying to find ultimate secret of the power of steel(a path that strongly connects him to Conan) and later finding the ultimate power in the flesh itself by creating his snake-sect couldn't be more timeless. It is for this depth that I can enjoy this movie again and again. If you can get over any hidden prejudices about the fantasy genre, watch this movie, it's a treat.The slightly over the top voice overs and the scene in which Conan's parents get killed are a treat for every movie aficionado.Where movies like Willow or Fire&Ice are good entertainment, next time you watch this movie, think about how much we have been praying to power through machinery and other forms of technology that came after the invention of steel.",Conan the Barbarian
292,dils94,A hugely underrated masterpiece,10,7 September 2017,"This is quite frankly, one of the most underrated films of all time. John Milius' (writer of apocalypse Now, Dirty harry's famous Magnum speech, and Quints famous Indianapolis monologue from Jaws) film evokes an earlier age with the passion, poetry and fury of Kurosawa, John Ford and Eisenstein. The score on the other hand, is hands down one of Hollywoods' greatest, certainly on par with Rosza and Steiner of old. Oft dismissed as a ""dumb 80s Arnie flick"", the film both romantically and brutally recreates an earlier age of mankind, whereby life was cheap and only the fittest could survive. As a student of ancient history, I was struck the more I studied at just how accurate this film had been in recreating the life of the people whom lived in history. They believed in ancient religions of snakes and mountain gods, they fought brutal wars of raiding, pillaging and genocide, and suffered from the same, they feared sorcerers and magicians and travelled in a world of immense cultural diversity prior to the rise of empires. This is the world as ancient man saw it. Combine this with the narrative philosophy and themes: Neitzsche, the heros journey, Pulp and you have a masterpiece. Its a pity Milius wasn't brought back for the sequel and were robbed of another gem. This is the very definition of a film that grows on you.",Conan the Barbarian
293,gideonx,"Surprisingly, a film with substance and some historical accuracy",9,24 December 2019,"Watching this movie after reading about central asian steppe civilizations like the Mongols, Scythians, Huns, Parthians, Cimmerians, etc, I was surprised to find that the landscape John Milius projected would be an accurate depiction of the time. John Milius is known to be a fan of history and includes aspects of some of the central asian steppe civilizations in the movie. Cult-like religions were all over the place during that period, tribes subsisted by raiding each other; central asian ethnicities are accurately portrayed; Scythians loved gold and jewel encrusted cups, armor, decoration, and skull cups; google what a Hun looked like; Many of the the steppe civilizations enjoyed being grossly intoxicated; Arnold even recites a quote from Genghis Khan.This is Arnold's first big role and he had to earn his keep for it. He wasn't just thrown into a cop or CIA agent role with no explanation of his accent. If Arnold's accent makes sense in any movie it makes the most sense in this one.The cons are that perhaps the acting is not the greatest and a few other things are a bit over the top but hopefully, you can enjoy this movie for more than just another Arnold movie.If you need one more reason to watch this movie let this be it.

He fights his way out of slavery, masters many weapon/fighting techniques and becomes the greatest warrior with a sword (ever in my opinion). This is the best barbarian movie of all time. Nothing else comes close to Conan the Barbarian when it comes to swords and a good story. I have personally seen this movie countless times and enjoy it each time. For some reason though I have seen 3 different endings. The camel-punching scene is a classic. A lot of the bad guys look very similar to 80's metal band members if you ask me.

301,OsKar-Azl,Review of Conan the Barbarian (1982) by OsKar-Azl,8,28 June 2020,"Film adaptation of the character of Conan starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Movie script: after the death of his parents, Conan must become a warrior to obtain his revenge for the past. The story is interesting, from its main plot and the subplots that appear. There are some moments when you can get lost because you do not understand what is happening, but they are in infamous scenes.Composition: They take their time to tell the origin of Conan, developing the character well. In general, at some points the plot does not follow quite well since they have facts with a voice over. The action scenes are incredible and have a lot of blood, they also have abundant scenes of this type.Vision: The setting and aesthetics are very good and well adapted. The special effects have not aged badly, but they are currently very surmountable.Performance: Both the protagonist and the villain act well, but I'm not memorable either. The rest of the characters do their job.Opinion: It is a great fantasy movie very entertaining and quite bloody.Note: 8 / 10.",Conan the Barbarian

304,drjzm138,Wonderful visual story-telling,10,5 January 2009,"I will premise this comment by saying that this is my favorite movie of all-time. With that said, I do believe this is one of those films that was close to perfectly made as possible. Before anyone criticizes that mind you that I recognize that it wasn't ACTUALLY made perfectly, but close in my mind.If you are of the idealogy that the soundtrack is a huge part of a film... then Basil's work on this film will not disappoint you. The soundtrack is phenomenal and is the only movie soundtrack that I own (and listen to on frequent occasions). The character of Conan almost has this feeling of absolution. He says next to nothing the entire film and his ""character"" is based on his actions and experiences. Arnold's career now may be looked at as all-action/no-acting, but his presence in Conan showed an ability to capture a character, whom oddly enough is extremely close to his own real life.The movie has a wonderful setting which has such a ""real"" feeling to it. The supplemental characters are fantastic; Gerry Lopez plays the sidekick perfectly, Max Von Sydow may overact a little but delivers the performance of a king as asked, Mako plays a wizard with an eccentric personality and offers a range of facial expressions that lack any subtleness, Ben Davidson may have an over the top death scene, but he epitomizes what you would expect from his character, and James Earl Jones plays an eerie villain that puts fear in you for his lack of emotion.John Milius and Oliver Stone put together a great story with solid pace... explaining Conan's beginnings with little waste (even with the odd introduction of magic with his sex for information proposition in the early parts.If you have read this and feel that my comment and description of this film is lacking... I apologize. The only way I can think of how this movie has not gotten the same type of respect that Gladiator or Spartacus has received is because undue perception has been attached to the film. You will see flaws (some of the sword work for example), but in terms of story-telling and setting the scene/mood, you will not be disappointed.",Conan the Barbarian
305,kristian_dancer,Lessons For Life One Of my Favourites of all time,10,2 October 2007,"Conan this film is timeless due to not pandering to the ratings . When this was first released the theater was full of cheering hells angles and such. Sometimes simple right and wrong is great. The character is the man all little boys want to be when they become men respected, hard,and in control of his own destiny and no matter who stands against him if he is right the gods will grant him victory or death.Sounds corny but it really isn't hero's don't always have to be complicated somethings are better simple the force of will is often underestimated. The sound track buy Basil Polidris (excuse bad spelling) Is also Oscar worthy although finding a stereo recording is virtually impossible.Arnie is just about perfect for the role although I am very angry that they strayed from the Blue eyes and Jet black hair of the original Robert E Howard Character The whole cimmerian race in the books are known as the black hairs (Bad Choice John Milius).No great acting is necessary the chacter was always of few words and great deeds actions speak louder than words anyway.The Older cast James Earl Jones and Max Von Syndow fill out the story with great performances and voices which really rounds the film out nicely.The sword play is realistic with no over gore a great balance of realism no flying people just good fencing and really very good broadsword work there is a great speed to the fights that really i don't think has been equaled in any other movie Lord of the rings is ridiculous blade almost to showy this is very believable If you ever swing a broadsword with enough power to sever a limb you will know it takes a sec to recoil adding that sense of realism there were a lot of injury's during filming by the way.If you look at this as a way to wet your appetite for the books your on the write road the books are infinitely better though with great moral values and fantastic pace to the story telling.The one thing that I am particularly glad about is that this stayed with the R rating after all killing looting wenching and the slaying of evil wizards is hardly a child's passtime. With the rights for a new Conan Movie now in the hands of Millennium Films sold to by Paradox I hope they follow this theme in fact if they went along the lines of 300 or Sin City they would not be far wrong.",Conan the Barbarian

I started playing D&D and some other fantasy-role-playing games (today TDE) and this film all combines it: Barbarian, Thief, Mage...Arnold Schwarzenegger is at its best and this film made him to the star in my opinion, not the Terminator from 1984.As someone who likes LOTR or fantasy at all, this is a must see. There is not another film made around 1981 that I have watched more often with friends or alone, and if there is the film around in TV again, I'll always stop there and watch it to the end.Normally after 2 or 3 times a film gets bored, because one knows everything, but this is the only one I've seen in almost all versions, cut, uncut, directors cut - I started to count after several times of seeing it and normally it should be 25 or 26 views I gave this film.One of the big points is Conan himself, who is not the bright hero winning his fights easy going, it rather is a sad story, and almost every character in this film has his personal fate.

Ever since i was like 4 yrs old i've been into this film. I watched it over and over again like kids watch Shrek these days. LOL. Even now that I'm 18 yrs old i watch it every month or so, i can never get sick of it. James Earl Jones was a great villain, and Max Von Sydow delivered King Osric just as he does in all his films, with the passion. I love this movie and give it ***** out of five.

The Gubanator does an excellent job portraying a gladiator turned hero. Also it's nice to see Oliver Stone piece together Bob Howard's classic yarns. This film has much to offer for anyone who can look past Arnold as an actor, and just enjoy the story. When people run down this movie, I can usually remind them that it is the sequel they speak of(that they caught on a certain run-down cable channel two years ago), not the classic original film. I am a musician, and the thing that keeps brining me back to this picture is the score. The powerful music along with the films ideology, and beautiful shots get me every time I watch it.

The body language used in this movie is real, it's not over acted. The fighting scenes are believable that require no strings. The beauty of this movie is it's cinematography, landscapes, costumes, attitudes, the grace of each character, and most of all...the soundtrack.No other movie has this little of dialog in recent times that requires just a complete video experience with music to take you to another world. Every time you hear the primal nature of Basil's music, you literally just want to stand up and cheer.There have been no movies in recent times that are on the same level as this movie. Gladiator, LotR, Willow to name a few are excellent movies, but they required dialog and a lot of special effects and/or excellent actors to do it. Conan was done with a cast of people who I feel felt the role and when you saw them just standing there, fighting, walking, riding...it's like you felt their feelings. The music only adds to this.This is and always will be one of my favorite movies of all time, not only for nostalgia value, but because it's a beautifully crafted masterpiece.Before anyone says this movie is bad, give the movie another view.

313,gentzel,"Enjoyable, but falls well short of the source.",3,10 August 2001,"I find that people's opinion of this film varies widely depending on whether they've read any of the original Robert E. Howard stories.Howard was an amazingly powerful writer of great depth and versatility. His Conan was, despite being a barbarian, an intelligent and educated man.  A natural leader of men.  A master of combat, theft, and woodsmanship.As written by Milius, he is a revenge obsessed klutz.  He has all of the fighting moves and dexterity of an anvil.  All of the depth of a dry lake bed.Enjoy the movie for what it is, a fun (if shallow) magic and mayhem flick. Then read the vastly superior original stories.

The action and dialogue are great as well.  I liked this film so much that I added it to my personal collection.",Conan the Barbarian
315,Kasi,more than meets the eye,9,11 March 1999,"Conan the Barbarian is much undervalued as a movie. I think it's one of the best fantasy epics ever filmed. The work of Oliver Stone and John Milius shows, as Conan is presented, not as an all charming, smart swords-hero, but as a person who became revenge, growing from an animalistic state to something more. It is so often forgotten that Conan, whose family and people were murdered when he was a child, isn't a great intellectual even in adult age. Therefore the performance of Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't so disturbing. Milius directed Arnold to be plain, muscle-hero - which Conan would have been in those circumstances. Conan was a child in a grownup's body, longing only to avenge the deaths from his past. The issue is in the name of the movie, Conan the BARBARIAN. The barbarian got civilized in Kitai, but that doesn't change the fact that if a person has lived his late childhood in a labour camp (wheel of pain), he's not fully grown mentally. Arnold was the perfect child, and counting the brilliant role performances of James Earl Jones, and Max von Sydow, and the outstanding music of Basil Poledouris, I rated this movie with a nine (9).",Conan the Barbarian
316,film_fanatic,ARNOLD'S FINEST,8,19 February 2000,"Conan the Barbarian (hereinafter CTB) is quite simply Schwarzenegger's best movie.  Forget the big budget blockbusters and special-effects-tour-de-force-romps of the eighties and nineties.  Along with `Pumping Iron,' his bodybuilding documentary, CTB represents the perfect showcase for Arnold's natural talents (including the self-confidence of ten action film stars, a commanding physical presence, and a whip smart sense of humor).It does not hurt that CTB follows a predictable, albeit proven format, the three classical unities of the kung-fu genre:  (1) wrondoing  the snake cult massacres Conan's family; (2) rebirth  Conan learns the `riddle of steal' during his years as a pit fighter; and (3) revenge  Conan goes after the snake cult to avenge the killing of his parents.  CTB also boasts several veterans of the screen, including Max Von Sydow and James Earl Jones, and a moving and powerful score by Basil Poledouris.CTB is not about dialogue or what is spoken between characters.  Entire scenes that are central to the plot unfold without Conan uttering a single line of dialogue.  Take for instance the scene where Max Von Sydow charges Conan and his companions with the task of rescuing his daughter; the scene between Conan and Valeria where she tries to talk him out of accepting the rescue mission; the death of Valeria; and the climax where Conan confronts James Earl Jones.  But every scene sells itself and Arnold's co-stars are able to fill the void left by Conan's silence.  After all, Conan is a man of action, not a man of words.Instead, CTB is about the unspoken bond between friends, lovers, and family. Arnold is able to convey with stares, smirks, and laughter what lesser actors and films do with rambling, awkward, unbelievable dialogue.  Two shining examples of this, less is more approach, include the scenes where Conan cremates his lover and silences the King's daughter with a menacing look.When Arnold does speak, his timing has never been better and his delivery never more convincing.  Arnold seems completely at ease and comfortable in this role.  He does not fumble over dialogue and corny one-liners.  If Arnold were to make just one more movie, it should be the third installment in this series.Arnold is certainly no Deniro or Spacey, but he is wildly charismatic and easier to like as a person than either Brando or Nicholson.  And while CTB never experienced much success, at least it has achieved cult-classic status, which is more than can be said for rather forgettable Oscar winners such as Dances with Wolves and Driving Miss Daisy.  Anyone who does not like this film simply will not allow themselves to.  To CTB's detractors, I say shame on you for being movie snobs.",Conan the Barbarian

Every element seems an integral part of the story. The score by Basil Poledouris is outstanding, the direction, cinematography and design stunning, and the performances utterly believable.

I have seen all of the fantasy films that will come to mind; Dragonslayer, Excalibur (quite good), The Sword and the Sorcerer, Hearts and Armor... Whatever...Conan the Barbarian is what we want all of these other films to be.  Arnold rules, Sandhal is the ultimate warrioress, Lopez is a great second and Jones is a fully realized threat, with power, magic and pure evil in his soul.  Great set, great performances and a great effort to show violence the way we want fantasy movies to.  No comedic side-kick here of note, just blood and warfare.",Conan the Barbarian
323,tdelonga,Poetry,10,20 January 2010,"There are few movies that you can not stop watching - for me there are just handful of them, Conan is included. Conan is in a way pure poetry, virtually every scene is done with great love and understanding. From the start there is fantastic opening of Making the sword, ultra realistic attack on the village, Wheel of pain (great stuff - how to make time pass in few brilliant seconds), my favorite Recovery scene - Atlantean Sword Kata... Those five guys - John Millius, Oliver Stone, Basile Polidoris, Ron Cobb and Dino de Laurentis have made fantastic saga of honor, courage, friendship and love.What strikes me most are 3 things - there are no stupid morals of the good and evil or some kind of greater good, Milius and Stone don't waste time on that, second is brilliant production designe of Ron Cobb - the guy simply sucked us in Hybernian age without computer effects, and the third is simply fabulous soundtrack of late Basile Polidoris - they really don't make those kind of movies today.",Conan the Barbarian
324,jjesam,Misunderstood,9,20 April 2001,"This film is, in my opinion, largely misunderstood, and has been since the beginning of its production. It has been interpreted as just a muscles-and-gore flick. I think with more refined editing and marketing, it could be remembered now as a wonderful film with the campbellian elements of heroic myth and a story of Conan's personal growth as a man. Still, as an action movie it is first-class.",Conan the Barbarian
325,firefalcon12,"Excellent movie, hands down.",10,22 April 2001,This is one of the best movies that I've seen in a while. I've watched Conan The Barbarian at least twenty times and I still enjoy it every time. Arnold does a great job as Conan even if his Austrian accent can become awkward at times thoroughout the movie. I would recommend it to people who like fantasy films with lots of action and sorcery type stuff.,Conan the Barbarian
326,krazywumpus,way better than anything Hollywood put out before it...or since,10,3 April 2008,"this really is an amazingly well done fantasy movie. and i shudder to think that gladiator has gotten better reviews than this movie. it may not be an over-the-top blockbuster, but that's kinda the point. it's pretty minimalistic in it's dialog and some other aspects, but i only think that helps, not hurts it. personally, i can't stand to watch overdone Hollywood dramatizations such as gladiator. even lord of the rings, which were very well done movies, could've done without much of their over dramatic dialogs and extreme facial close ups that seem to go on forever. people have cited this movie as ""laughable"" but i personally think that many of peter jackson's choices for LOTR were equally laughable.",Conan the Barbarian

Its not really all that different than other movies from the same steel, although with a minimal acting structure. More is done with looks and subtle insight than with heavy acting sequences. Mostly just a fun romp through a fantasy -type adventure. Not to be taken seriously by any stretch of the imagination, but actually better to me than some of the 80's ""run-n-guns"" Arnold did. The ending isn't what I would have envisioned, but I have to say I have watched the movie many times.

It is always best to make sure that an actual person is not being replaced by a studio masked actor or character. Many peoples actual roles are being substituted with studio props. This technique may save money, but as realism and art are concerned, it looks slightly off-set. There are many masks in this feature, which I like. The story line is a bit off-set in my opinion. If someone likes Greek, Roman, Egyption, etc. ""mythology"" they would like to view this film. Although there are some obvious mistakes, it is fairly good.

On his way to Doom's temple he meets some friends and a king who pays them to free his daughter. As the first solo action is unsuccesful, and Conan got nearly killed, they try it for a second time as a team.

335,miles12-548-507865,Dated but an all time great.,9,18 July 2010,"I have heard that Hollywood plan to remake this movie my advice would be DON'T. Most of the remakes that seem to be coming out are very poor and I can't think of many remakes which have been better than the original, Batman was good but even that had some issues. I'm sure there are probably a few others but most of them are way too buttered up for a generation of kids who have probably never climbed a tree in their life let alone made a bow an arrow due to Mommy and Daddy worrying too much. This film is one of those films that should just be left alone because it doesn't matter what actor you use they simple aren't Arny they aren't Conan maybe do a sideline story that is linked to this film but just don't remake this into another diabolical spectacle.Some of the reviews on this film are utter rubbish. I hate people who say this film is not like the comic book so it's no good or it's not accurate enough and so on and so on. Basically if I wanted to watch a film based 100% on the comic I would watch a cartoon or animated version of it or perhaps read the comic itself or even maybe a TV series based on the comic. If I wanted something that was 100% accurate I'd watch a documentary. These thing's don't make a movie an enjoyable experience to watch but feel more like a history lesson or an utter bore that drags on for far too long because lets face it, the entire comic book collection of any hero is going to be massive. I agree that things should have a sense of realism about them but I fail to see how Conan The Barbarian fails to deliver this but just in a different story line.Why do I think this film is amazing? Basically it is fun to watch, serious to a degree, has some fantasy and gives a sense of barbarian times while delivering satisfaction as Conan hacks down his enemies one by one, also the sound track is good and for some reason instantly makes me think of war, everything you want in a movie is here you just have to open your eyes and stop looking for the real world or the comic book because you will never find it in 2 hours of a movie. Arny does an amazing job as Conan makes you feel like he's actually a Barbarian in the fact that he doesn't speak much due to his lack of acting talent during this time but everything he does is pretty much 100% perfect. Personally I feel a talented actor trying to redo this film will overshoot the mark too much or simply won't be able to pull it off. Hence a remake will fail to beat this, maybe a fresh audience will appreciate it but old school viewers will shunt it no doubt.The sequel to this film is awful why because it's buttered up for a family audience. This is a master piece and master pieces are exactly that for a reason.",Conan the Barbarian
336,talkchiropractic,What kind of movie viewer would give this movie even 1 or 2 stars?,1,29 October 2009,"This is one of Arnold's worst movies ever. The acting is pitiful. This movie is for people who are not entertained by a solid plot, human interaction and good content. If you enjoy poor acting and tasteless gratuitous nudity and sex. This movie is for you. If you enjoy fight scenes that look like something you would see in a parody movie then this movie is for you. The movies goes for several minutes with no human communication. The first words spoken are, ""Sit here"". These words appropriately define the depth of all future dialog. I can't honestly say that I would rather be mugged than waste 129 minutes watching this movie but if I was only beat for a few minutes and I didn't lose any money, I might prefer to be mugged. It was quite painful to watch Arnold try to act excited or angry or hurt. His groans were absolutely annoying. Be forewarned.",Conan the Barbarian
337,ephel_duath,Conan verdict.,7,5 April 2010,"Conan the Barbarian is an entertaining tale of swords, sorcery, lust and revenge. It delivers the goods on many fronts but falls short on others.I found this film to be quite fast paced which is always a good thing in fantasy adventure films because they can often become too wrapped up in plot which usually involves heavy dialogue.The action in this film is mediocre and is not believable at all despite the half decent sword choreography. There are some nice gore scenes though they are few and far between and it leaves me wondering where the barbarism is, this film is called Conan the Barbarian, right?.One thing I really did like about this film was the musical score which adds depth and some well needed emotion to the movie and makes it seem just that little bit more epic.Overall the film is entertaining to watch, but it could have done with a bit more graphic violence and realistic action to get across the barbarity of Conan.",Conan the Barbarian
338,wolfmansupreme,King of Fantasy,10,23 June 2005,"Conan the Barbarian is the best fantasy movie I've ever seen, and one of the best films ever. The lighting, costume and set design, and even the color on the film stock blow away every other fantasy film of its time. Even today, few movies come close to its beauty. The music is the best music ever composed for a film. I like John Williams and Danny Elfman, but Basil Poledouris wrote the perfect soundtrack to Conan. The instrumentation was perfect. It didn't ground the film in a specific time or place, just an ancient time. The music also played a very important part, since Conan was a very visual film with little dialogue. The opening scene alone is a perfect mix of well delivered lines, good cinematography, introduction of characters, music to reinforce the visual mood, and metaphors that flesh out throughout the movie. The pace set in the first three minutes keeps up until the last credits roll. This kind of perfection may never again be achieved, even by the people involved in creating this gem.",Conan the Barbarian
339,mwestphal2,A Classic Fantasy Adventure Film,10,19 July 2017,"Conan the Barbarian might just be a recipe for the greatest movie ever. Not only does this movie have Arnold in his prime, but it also has James Earl Jones, who might just be one of the greatest actors of all time. The film also has Max Von Sydow, which ends this film's connection to the Exorcist movies (except the scene where Conan has sex a witch and a demon comes out of her), and a whole lot of sex and violence.The musical score is absolutely amazing. Every scene has grand, epic music to go with the lavish production design, which eats up the screen like any good epic film would. This film and Excalibur, which came out a few years before this film, would be in the running for greatest musical score and production design pairing ever.What else can I say, but this movie has everything I could ever want. The movie does feel a little long at parts, but overall I would recommend this film to anyone who takes one look at the cover of the film and has an idea of what to expect, because you're going to get it.",Conan the Barbarian

341,shouken,The crown jewel of sword and sorcery films,10,29 May 2004,"This obviously isn't a film for everyone- if you're not into a film that weaves historical fantasy with sword and sorcery, then by all means, skip this movie. But Conan the Barbarian is a film for me. Though fantasy has come a long way in the two decades since this film was made (Lord of the Rings), I still find myself watching Conan over and over again, enjoying the clean-cut story and its context, the likable cast, the masterful music and scenery, and fight scenes that, while dated, still feel far more real than anything Peter Jackson can dish out.This also isn't the Conan that Robert E. Howard made. So what? The Lord of the Rings movies aren't the ones that Tolkien made. You can still enjoy the film as a film.The acting in this film gets panned way too much, and I'd call it unfair. It's easy to say ""Arnold can't act"" or ""Gerry Lopez was unconvincing."" Acting itself has become so...EASY to slap down without a second thought that we miss the point of it too often. I think the cast fit their characters like gloves, especially Arnold; it's nice to see a character who trusts his sword above all else, and an actor (yes, I said it) who can exemplify that. Mind, James Earl Jones and Max Von Sydow are head and shoulders above Arnold through sheer experience, but Arnold puts as much vitality into Conan as Jones and Sydow do for Thulsa Doom and King Osric. How did he do it? His FACE. Arnold is great at making you believe he's thinking, and great at telling you what he's thinking just through his physicality. He was made to play Conan, what can I say? So lighten up on the Gubernator; none of the characters in Conan are supposed to be Shakespearean.The story is immensely entertaining, but I'm going to focus on something else here- on the vitality of the movie. Mind, I'm going to have trouble not taking potshots at the overrated LOTR trilogy, so...John Milius' directing. He was never too blatant, and he let the context rule this film. Barbaric deeds are committed, but only when they're needed; other violent scenes are cut and work much better because they're unseen (the beheading of Conan's mother, Conan killing the dogs chasing him, etc.).Many of the shots he created in this film are shots every director should take advice from- the beginning attack on Conan's village with Thulsa Doom's riders using SUNLIGHT to mask their approach (genius), the long shot of the procession at the Mountain of Power, the humorous pattern shot with the huge spike that slams into one of Thulsa Doom's henchmen...beautiful.Ron Cobb's unbelievable set design. There is as much intricacy in his floor effects as there is in Lord of the Rings' CGI, and you know what? Cobb made it feel more real. I felt more tied to the Atlantean tomb where Conan finds his sword than I ever did to Minas Tirith. As Milius put it, everything Ron Cobb designed had a practicality to it, echoed of other times- and of course, Cobb created the legendary Conan swords.the battle scenes. Dated, certainly, and I could put the blood on my hotdog, but the fights themselves are so much more fluid and clean, the best of any fantasy film. Many slashes are dodged rather than blocked. Terrain is utilized. Most of all, the heroes get hurt. You would not believe how rare that is in fantasy films. Conan is wounded fighting two bigger, stronger men, yet Aragorn can charge into a pack of Orcs with one sword and he just gets a little dirty? Legolas can kill an Oliphaunt and its ten riders with his endless supply of arrows? Please.Basil Poledouris' musical score. Unbelievable, and enough said at that. The soundtrack is something you can be proud of owning.The movie is not without its flaws, particularly a continuity goof at the end battles where the sky shifts colors constantly through the final battle.The combat is a little rough around the edges, and the blood sometimes looks a little TOO fake, haha! Finally, I hated the ""do you want to live forever?"" thing that Sandahl Bergman's character, Valeria, was always stuck with saying (what does that MEAN?), but the vitality in this movie makes me not care. Conan entertains, engages, and enthralls (a little emphasis for you there, heh). The feel of this movie is how the feel of any sword and sorcery flick should be.Theology in particular gets a humorous but still 'real' look in Conan the Barbarian, with the dialogue between Conan and his god, Crom, at a few points- often unspoken (and on that note, Arnold did a great job at the end with his prayer). In that light, Conan's belief seems much more normal: never too formal, always looking up expectantly. His faith is never bogged down in ritual or fantasy, it's just something that Conan believes- unbiased and seldom spoken. Very artistic.Looking over the film as a whole, I say John Milius has every right in the world to be proud of it. Everyone who touched this movie has a right to be proud of it. It never swept the Oscars, but it didn't have to. It was an enjoyable and magnetic film, one you can spend a Friday evening on with no regrets, the flaws all trivial compared to the fun viewing experience. Oh, and you will utter at least one quote from this film at least once in your life. I guarantee it.""Conan!

And you will never be able to forget James Earl Jones as Thulsa Doom. The most powerful villain ever. I cannot ever see Darth Vader as anything but a bad copy of Thulsa Doom.

By that i mean that conan wasn't a joker and babyoiled coverboy like in the sequel. Only part of the movie that i weren't content about was the childhood of conan, the part where he grows up spinning some goddamn wheel of fortune, Howard specifically points in many novels that Conan was grown free in the Cimmeria.

At its core this is a story of revenge. The most brutal human emotion we possess after jealousy. The blood-lust is sated and many people are saved in the process as a cult crumbles thanks to our hero Conan (unless you were cheering for Thulsa Doom, which is understandable.) Sure you can get way deeper with the script. That's why this movie rules, but this movie is straight up grabbing a sword and sticking it in the gut of your enemy. No gigantic explosions or car chases. No, it's much more personal. As many sword and sorcery epics come out and make more and more use of CGI effects the natural tendency of some will be to look back at the vision of Robert E. Howard. Low fantasy (as opposed to high fantasy. You know, wizards like Harry Potter and stuff going to wizard school and getting his doctorate in f***ing with niggles (IMDB wouldn't let me use the appropriate term ha ha).)

Years later when I was old enough to watch this film I was dumbfounded! easily Arnolds best and I would imagine his own favourite, along with The Terminator, despite the mockery from people who want 'highbrow' and cant understand 'popular' film.

I always recheck films iv seen when younger because sometimes you are more over-awed than anything but this film always brings out the same feeling each time i see it. Its a classic without a doubt and its one of those movies that have been ruined by inferior sequels - destroyer was a joke right? The same way Rambo First blood was ruined by its sequels this film was turned into a joke.If Arnold had lived up to his acting credentials in this film and took less larger than life roles, my god i think he would of been more respected as an actor and i would of loved to have seen him achieve that! He was superb in this one. In my opinion his finest and i'm sure when I am many years older a younger generation of film buffs will say the same",Conan the Barbarian
356,wbmktg,Arnie at his best,10,24 August 2005,"Arnie is perfectly cast as Conan, and James Earl Jones a perfect last surviving godlike creature.. All the cast did an excellent job and I remember being left breathless when I first saw the film in 1982.. Seen it numerous times since then and still never get tired of it.. One question regarding the movie for a true Conan fanatic like me is, can you see the spirit of Robert E Howard's Conan the Barbarian throughout the movie? The answer is probably not...Seeing a bowing and shamefaced Conan in front of King Osric, or a beaten, exhausted and broken down Conan in front of Thulsa Doom is not a sight that you would see in the comics or read in the novels, Conan bows to no one in the novels I have read.. However viewed as an alternate Conan, similar to Howard's, but far from a strict interpretation, this film is a timeless classic.. This film is probably the best of the lot when it comes to sword films, it is so believable that it is amazing we are only watching a film. The locations, costumes and characters all bring to mind a world full of darkness and death.. Lest I forget, a most wonderful soundtrack as well.. This film pretty much defines the genre, and it also set a standard that I'm not sure has been reached since 1982..",Conan the Barbarian
357,tomnoddy1,Solid 10/10 for me. Very underrated.,10,22 July 2014,"As far as other films of this genre go, this stands head and shoulders above all in terms of visual and audible stimuli, authenticity or gravitas, and general 'epicness'.In an era of lightweight CGI filled action movies, 'Conan The Barbarian's combination of relatively a simple story with rich thematic undertones, a mix of bad and great actors, sparse yet interesting dialogue, and an incredible score, make this a film that has stood the test of time admirably. The direction by John Milius is really very skillful, with most major scene's seemingly being directed and edited to some of the finest epic orchestral/choral music to be committed to celluloid. Basil Poledouris should go down as one of the all time great composers.Really, this is the kind of film that simply doesn't get made these days, and that's just another factor to to it's awesomeness.",Conan the Barbarian
358,roberthowardfan,R E Howard's Conan by way of Nietzsche,9,19 July 2007,"This is an near perfect movie featuring Robert Howard's most famous character. It contains some of the best music ever produced for a film score and fleshes out its lead characters admirably. In many ways, it mirrors Howard's original Hyborian world with somewhat muted fantasy elements, beautiful women, violence, revenge, sword fights, and fatalistic philosophy. It doesn't completely follow Howard's design for Conan but instead drifts off in an overtly Nietzschean direction with Conan becoming an avenging ronin battling an evil sorcerer and merciless vikings. Both Conan and Valeria are empathetic if incredibly violent and somewhat exaggerated characters, while the theme of strength gained through adversity and vengeance gained through sheer perseverance--the most distinctly Nietzschean aspect of the film--is apparent from beginning to end. Had Milius made this more like Howard's Hyborian Conan rather than adding much philosophy and an eastern warrior code not present in the original work, it would definitely rate a 10. As it stands, though, it is a brilliant piece of work in its own right and stands well even now a quarter century after its initial appearance.",Conan the Barbarian

360,gemini_sings,An excellent opportunity to journey into the ancient kingdom of Nostalgia...,9,26 August 2005,"Firstly, I will openly admit to owning ""Conan"" books but not actually having read them - yet. I'll get around to it I'm sure. Now, ""Conan the Barbarian"" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Earl Jones (the original Darth Vader!) is by far one of the most memorable films from my childhood - I still cherish the times my late father and I would hop in the car and go rent 'one of those Barbarian movies' and watch it together because no other family member enjoyed them as much... Aah yes I remember: ""The Beastmaster"", ""The Barbarian Brothers"", ""Ator the Fighting Eagle"", and ""Amazons"" among others. ""Conan the Barbarian"" remains in my eyes second only to my favourite sword-&-sorcery film ""Red Sonja"" although the drama and story are actually better and more 'adult orientated' in ""Conan"" even if both movies have the same entertainment value. And I don't care what anybody thinks: Arnold IS good as Conan the Cimmerian, quite a striking image and not just a faceless muscle-man. Especially since Conan is a Celtic name and Arnold hails from Austria, where archaeologists discovered the earliest traces of Celtic culture - related to the culture of the Cimmerians, a race of horsemen which really did exist on the European continent although not as long ago as 12 000 BC and certainly not in the form of romanticized 'noble savages' that they and other barbarian peoples were considered as by some in the late 19th century. I think the ""Conan"" films are better than the comic books, and if you've ever enjoyed films and television series such as ""Kull the Conqueror"", ""Gladiator"", ""Willow"", ""Xena"" or ""Hercules"" I would recommend ""Conan the Barbarian"" as well as its sequel ""Conan the Destroyer"" to a slightly lesser extent, and most of the above mentioned films (except maybe for ""Amazons"" and ""Ator"" unless your expectations are low...) for the sheer fun of letting your imagination run wild and free for a couple of hours!",Conan the Barbarian
361,krazipersun,A man seeks revenge for the death of his people.,8,8 December 2016,"Conan is a movie a I love to death. It's also a movie with flaws I laugh at. The movie isn't impressive, but darn it, it's amazing. The acting isn't good, but the casting is perfect. The dialogue is corny, but it's completely appropriate. The movie is one of the most unpolished masterpieces I've ever seen. If the production values were any higher, it would probably be less lovable. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays our titular hero Conan, whose village is destroyed by Thulsa Doom, played by James Earl Jones, with his army of bandits and cultists right after the boy Conan is taught the path to his religion's salvation by his father. The path to his religion's salvation is the answer to the Riddle of Steel: the idea that no man can trust any living being, but a man can always trust the sword.The plot is as simple as it gets: this is a low fantasy revenge story, and that frankly is enough we need. Simple stories keep the narrative tight and without plot holes. However, in order to avoid clichés, the characters must solve the obstacles in their environment in interesting ways. Conan is interesting because he is a meat head, but he's also a deep thinker. Valeria, his love interest is interesting because she is actually braver and more reckless than Conan, and Conan is no coward.The real spectacle to see in this film is the fact it's so friggin' goofy as it is heartfelt. We feel as Conan does in spite of the giant goofy puppets. We wish we were in Conan's world of adventure, even though everyone dresses like cavemen at Woodstock. On top of that, there is some light philosophy mixed in there as well. The movie is not just about Conan taking revenge, it's about a slave becoming the master and a normal person becoming a Superman. The film makes it obvious in the very beginning by opening a quote from Nietzsche ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."" The entire film's symbolism revolves around master-slave morality, the Death of God in society, and the journey to becoming the superman. Sadly, the reason why I love this movie is because it's mediocre. The puppets are fake looking, the costumes are cheap, the acting is odd, and the sets are chunky. The production values betray the message of reaching one's full potential because the film itself doesn't and strangely shouldn't. The movie is as good as it is, and it's actually endearing that the flaws are there. The movie doesn't show Conan's story, it just simply represents it. In that way, it's more like a book than a film.",Conan the Barbarian
362,jushubble,All time great,10,14 February 2021,"This is a polarising film. People love it or hate it. For me it is simply the best. The music, the cinematography, the raw brutality of it. Sure the dialogue is dodgy but everything else is epic. I loved this film when I first saw it and again now as a much older individual (five O). What is best in life?!",Conan the Barbarian

365,vjenkinson,Lost Oliver Stone Patty Hearst Story,8,16 December 2005,"I know that Milius (sp?) rewrote the Stone's script, but I've always believed that Stone was basing the script on the Patty Hearst Kidnapping. Not to make too much of this, it's really on the latter part of the movie, but think about it: The King/Hearst has his daughter kidnapped by a black clad army that hangs out with hippies and flower children.Otherwise, all I've to add is my rating. I've always loved this movie (hated the Destroyer). And I'm still upset that at the end, we were promised King Conan (I always thought Arnie looked pretty cool as the old bearded king at the end) and all we got was governor Conan.",Conan the Barbarian

368,noirogas,The Ultimate Epic Masterpiece,10,8 February 2006,"The Ultimate Epic Masterpiece. Even Swarzeneker is great in that film (speaks less than in Terminator, that's why, hehe). Whatever Dino De Laurentis touches is pure gold. And what about Polidouris music... brilliant and classic!!! The Greeks have done it again. Only greeks or Scandinavians could write such lyrical and yet powerful epic music. A 10+ out of 10 is too little to describe the movie. Should come up with a third Conan instead of making another Terminator. The rest of the cast is great, the story is great, the scenario is awesome (a young Oliver Stone!! gives his best). Who hasn't seen and appreciated this movie is a criminal and his head should be taken by this noble savage that calls himself... Conan!!",Conan the Barbarian
