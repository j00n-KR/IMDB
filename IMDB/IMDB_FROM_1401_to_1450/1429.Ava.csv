0,Leofwine_draca,Lamentable,3,29 December 2020,"AVA is a lamentable excuse for an action thriller, apparently made by Jessica Chastain who produced as well as stars. I get the feeling she saw Jennifer Lawrence in RED SPARROW and decided to do her own version. I wasn't a huge fan of the Lawrence movie but it's ten times better than this cheap misfire, which suffers from appalling direction throughout, direction so bad that it makes every actor look wooden when they open their mouths. It was by the guy who did THE HELP and MA, but apparently he was drafted in at the last minute and boy, does it show. The most impressive thing about this is the cast, including Colin Farrell, John Malkovich, Ioan Gruffudd, Joan Chen and many others, and the least impressive are the stock fight scenes, in which Chastain has to be doubled for every single little move. I felt like I was watching a Seagal movie at times...",Ava
1,SnoopyStyle,all that talent in a B-movie,5,31 August 2020,"Ava Faulkner (Jessica Chastain) is a professional assassin. She was an over-achiever, a drunk, and then a soldier. She is constantly battling her addiction. She got recruited by her superior Duke (John Malkovich) into the company. To his dismay, she continues to ask her victims questions before she kills them. Duke's boss Simon (Colin Farrell) is concerned. Ava returns to visit her family after an 8 year absence. Her sister Judy (Jess Weixler) is dating her ex Michael (Common). Her mother Bobbi (Geena Davis) is in the hospital for a minor heart attack.This has lots of big name actors. This needs to decide what it wants to be. It has all the elements of gritty personal drama and flashiness of an international murderous conglomerate. In one moment, it has some realism and in another, it has all the fighting gun action of the latest John Wick film. It hits me all at once in Saudi Arabia. I'm fine with the exaggerated fighting in the hotel room. I'm excited by her pretending to be the damsel in distress. Taking on a squad of heavily armed soldiers is just being unnecessarily over the top. They don't seem to know how serious to take this movie. It ends up being a B-movie with a lot of talent who are cashing in some cheques.",Ava
2,nogodnomasters,What did you do?,7,6 September 2020,"Ava Faulkner (Jessica Chastain) is a paid assassin from Boston. If you miss her quick bio during the opening credits they recap it at her AA meeting. She gets her orders from John Malkovich. After a hit that has gone awry, Ava becomes a liability to the company.Half the film is a drama about Ava's family. Geena Davis plays her mother and Jess Weixler is her sister. Common is her sister's boyfriend and her ex-boyfriend with a gambling problem. Chastain and Malkovich is a must-see for me in any film. They did a great job.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Ava
3,kosmasp,And Edam?,6,23 February 2021,"And we're back into the 90s again, sort of. We do have a female lead though. And I don't mind the very predictable structure that much (feel free to disagreee here). What I do mind is the execution of the action and the stunts. They are not bad, but they don't incite excitement either - not as much as they could.I do love Jessica Chastain, but her action hero ego does not come off as strong - not as strong as it is supposed to be. A shame almost, especially because a fight scene Malkovich has, seems more potent and lethal than most of the other stuff. And that is what an action movie should prioritize, shouldn't it? If you are more forgiving in that aspect, maybe the paper thin story will wring more out of this than for others. Or maybe just the fact that you have really good actors (overqualified some might say) in this ... whatever floats your boat",Ava
4,classicsoncall,"""You'll always be cakes to me.""",7,4 January 2021,"Well, call me crazy but I didn't think this was too bad, unlike a lot of reviewers here who don't cut it any slack. I guess after you've seen a few dozen assassin films, it does get more difficult to encounter a new and original idea. The lead here is portrayed by Jessica Chastain as the title character, an elite killer who tries to get into the head of her victims, causing some consternation among her handlers. Her direct report is John Malkovich, no stranger to assassin flicks (""Red 2""), who goes by the name of Duke, and when he assigns a target with an easily differentiated name, she kills the wrong guy. That sets in motion yet another plan to eliminate Ava by the Duke's boss, Simon (Colin Farrell, no stranger to assassin films - ""In Bruges"", ""Dead Man Down""). What follows is Ava's attempt to remain alive, with a sub-plot involving her ex-boyfriend (Common - no stranger to assassin movies - ""John Wick: Chapter 2"") who's now involved with her sister. By refusing to rescind the hit on Ava, Simon runs afoul of Duke's favorable instincts toward her, and makes short work of Ava's handler. That sets up the final confrontation between Simon and Ava, and going by the name of the picture, I leave it to the reader to surmise who comes out on top. One interesting side note, the role of Ava's mother in the story was played by Geena Davis, who I haven't seen now in quite a while. Of course, she would be no stranger to assassin films either, having appeared in ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"". And if Common keeps that beard, he would make a good candidate for the lead in the 'Kareem Abdul Jabbar Story' if one was ever made, don't you think?One final thought, the finale for this film leaves open the idea of a sequel, in as much as Simon's daughter (Diana Silvers) is an assassin in training, and she's shown following Ava under cover of a busy street. If that were the case, you know the drill by now, it would make Jessica Chastain no stranger to assassin flicks.",Ava
5,Tweekums,Solid enough action hampered by an unnecessary subplot,6,10 December 2020,"This film is centred on Ava Faulkner, an assassin with addiction problems and a desire to know why her victims are being targeted. This latter quirk bothers her employers. Duke, her direct superior and father figure wants to protect her but others, higher up, believe she is a liability. After an operation goes wrong due to faulty intelligence she suspects that her employers want her dead. Duke tries to persuade her that she is just being paranoid. If that weren't enough there are problems with her family; her ex-boyfriend Michael, who is now her sister's fiancé, has gambling problems which have led to large debts.I thought this started well and was intrigued by Ava's life as an assassin... I assumed that the plot would eventually lead to who her employers were and what their motives were. Instead it led to the unnecessary subplot involving Michael; this felt a distraction from the main story, as if the makers thought they had an hour's worth of material and needed to pad the film out to an hour and a half. It is a pity they didn't pad it with a bit more action connected to the main plot as what we got there was exciting and well-choreographed; the fights had an impressively physical feel to them. There are of course plenty of clichés but that goes with the genre. Jessica Chastain gives an impressive performance as Ava and John Malkovich and Colin Farrell are solid as Duke and antagonist Simon respectively. Geena Davis is fun as Ava's mother, although her presence made me think of her lead in 'The Long Kiss Goodnight'; a superior female lead action film. Overall it passes the time well enough if you are a fan of the genre but is hardly a must see.",Ava
6,paul_haakonsen,I found it to be enjoyable...,6,11 September 2020,"Well, while the 2020 movie ""Ava"" does have some overly-used clichés for this particular type of movie, it actually still turned out to be a rather enjoyable and entertaining movie.I sat down to watch the movie initially because it had John Malkovich and Colin Farrell on the cast list. And it was more than pleasing to also see the likes of Geena Davis, Ioan Gruffudd and Joan Chen make appearances in the movie. I must admit that I was especially fond of Joan Chen's character, just a shame that she didn't have more screen time. Now, I can't claim to be overly familiar with lead actress Jessica Chastain, but she really carried the movie well with her performance here.""Ava"" provides a good amount of action and character development at the same time, while it spices it up with a pinch of drama and thrills. I actually enjoyed the storyline told in this movie by writer Matthew Newton, though it definitely had some generic elements for this particular genre of movie. But it was at the same time interesting and fresh enough to actually get past those clichés.Sure, the storyline was predictable, and there weren't actually any surprises along the way. But while the movie was as it turned out to be, I found it to actually not be any less entertaining given that factor.You know what you are in for when you sit down to watch a movie such as ""Ava"" from director Tate Taylor, but something the predictable serving can be a good thing.I enjoyed this movie, thus I am rating it a six out of ten stars.",Ava
7,searchanddestroy-1,Best female assassin topic so far,8,24 May 2021,"I prefer this feature one hundred times more than Luc Besson's ANNA for instance. Not that the fights are better, but the overall story and acting are more sensitive, more poignant and closer to characters. Colin Farrell is terrific as the bad guy dude, maybe the only one in his whole career. Since several years now, you have many female bad ass topic killer females, hired killer I mean, and most of them are garbage. Here, I agree that Jessica Chastain is more a Academy Award actress than an action flick one, but she did her best and that's not bad. She is not. Gina Carano either, but no female is. A good film to watch.",Ava
8,LeonLouisRicci,BRUISING FEMALE-ASSASSIN (another one)...JESSICA CHASTAIN VEHICLE,7,12 August 2021,"One More in a Series of Luc Besson Inspired ""Girls With Guns"" Movies.Jessica Chastain Stars and Produces this Good-Try Genre Offering.The Ultra-Stylish Besson Touch is No Where Evident.OK Thriller that Deviates from its ""Reason to Exist"" too Much and that Collapses the Film to Average.In Between the Well-Choreographed Martial-Arts and Gun-Fu that Put the People in the Seats,this one is Want to Deep-Dive into Personal Flaws and Family Matters.An Overload of Mom and Sister Issues, Old Boy Friends, and Her Past as an Addict.She Kicks-Ass with the Best and Has Cuts and Bruises Throughout to Show for it.The Sub-Plot most Relevant to the Movie is Her 'Father-Figure"" and Handler, John Malkovich,and His Shaky Relationship with ""Management"" and His Other Protege, Colin Farrell.This is Suspenseful and Intriguing.But the Movie Returns Ad Nauseum to the Aforementioned ""Personal"" Stuff and the Movie Slams to a Halt.Remove All that ""Touchy-Feely"" Filler and it's Quite a Ride.Chastain, Malkoivich, and Farrell are Fine.But Common is a Stiff and a Bore, and Genna Davis is Wasted.For the Assassin Action its...Worth a Watch.",Ava
9,CinemaSerf,"Been there, done that...",5,9 December 2020,"When I looked at the pretty decent cast list, I dared to hope that this wouldn't just be the same old formulaic hybrid acton film - but oh, well - one can but dream! Jessica Chastain in the title role is an assassin. When her latest job in Russia goes awry, her handler ""Duke"" (John Malkovich) tries to shield her from the oncoming storm as she seeks some sort of refuge with her estranged family (a poorly mother - Geena Davis; her sister and her boyfriend). Enter ""Simon"" (Colin Farrell) and some really tediously long fight scenes and, well you know the drill. I know I shouldn't have been surprised by the derivative nature of this, but Farrell has long since lost his on-screen charm; Malkovich adds surprisingly little and reformed alcoholic/druggie ""Ava"" has virtually no redeeming features to her character to make anyone care whether or not she lives/dies or just drinks herself into well deserved oblivion. Mercifully, it's only 90-odd minutes, but even then it frequently drags with a stilted dialogue and shallow characterisations. As an action movie, we have seen it all before, many times - and I would not bother if I were you.",Ava
10,Calicodreamin,Lacks focus,4,7 December 2020,"Not sure what the point of this movie was, a lot of different subplots but no focus. Ava doesn't really fit into a good action category which leaves it aimless. Decent enough acting and cinematography.",Ava
11,siderite,Useless drivel,4,27 April 2021,"If I were a feminist, I would be angry right now. The main character is a female assassin, but in order to make her ""work"" the writers made her an addict white trash with family issues, with a grandfatherly mentor and with a need to understand what her victims did wrong. They had to make her appear ""good"" because she was female. When she kills she isn't macho, proud or cool, but just a little girl who seeks approval from her male mentor while feeling guilty about it.I am not a feminist, but I am still angry, because they used a great cast to make a really dumb film. I never liked Jessica Chastain much, but she is a good actress. Then there are the cast bait-and-switches: John Malkovich, Geena Davis, Joan Chen and Colin Farrell. The other three are old enough, but what the hell happened to you, Colin?! Even random victim Ioan Gruffudd is too good for this movie!Anyway, the plot of the film is so predictable, so stupid, so formulaic that it adds nothing to what you get from the movie poster. The only good thing about this film is the music from Bear McCreary.Would it be so bad if the characters doing bad things would not really feel guilty about it, but still be the heroes? Would it be so bad that people making films would actually took pride and care about their work? Nerdrotic said something today that resonated with me: these actors that we worship for their skills, they are rented to say the words written by other people and approved of by big corporations. Why do I keep feeling pain when I see them misused like this?Bottom line: take a good look at the poster and imagine a film that would fit it and it will be better than this lazy complacent piece of crap!",Ava

Story by aussie Matt Newton.",Ava
13,FeastMode,sucky,3,21 May 2021,"This movie is an hour and a half but felt over two hours. They spend much of the runtime on family and relationship drama, and a few other pointless subplots. At one point i wondered, why is this the movie? Lolthe fight scenes ranged from decent to bad. Much of it was unclear with close-ups, quick cuts and shaky cam. Some parts were decent, but nothing special. The story was regular, not much intrigue. And by the end, i didn't care at all (1 viewing, 5/20/2021)",Ava
14,Cineanalyst,Ho-Hum,3,10 December 2020,"I guess there aren't many great actors who don't also do action movies anymore. Some of them are pretty good at it. Jessica Chastain had already played the baddie in one of the X-Men burgers, ""Dark Phoenix"" (2019), and here she is in one of those double-crossed hired-gun things, ""Ava."" Lot of choppy cutting around punches and kicks and stuff. As strong as the 5'4"" or so Chastain surely is, I started to have my doubts re in-the-realm-of-remotely-possible after she arm flipped the half-dozenth guy over in hand-to-hand combat. I don't know--I'd need to see her with a friend who turns into a giant green CGI Mr. Hyde every time he gets angry for me to fully suspend my disbelief on that one. But, if I'm not going to complain about her slipping around bullets in a floor-long dress, I should probably drop the matter.Lot of tough talk and dead stares in this one, too. Despite her character in this one getting into trouble for being too chatty, I'm thinking Chastain is the female equivalent of Ryan Gosling. The camera seems to love hanging on their silent, almost expressionless faces. ""The Tree of Life,"" ""Drive"" (both 2011), ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012), ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017). They seem like chill, quiet folks to me for being occasional action stars whose characters kill people. By the way, an internet search of the female equivalent of Gosling, as does Chastain and Gosling, turns up more than I would've thought.Come to think of it, big stars have long done blockbuster-type roles for paychecks, but it seems as though it used to be more so in supporting roles, to lend some prestige to such flicks. Think Marlon Brando in ""Superman"" (1978), say, or Helen Mirren in a ""Fast & Furious"" installment. Here, there's also John Malkovich, Geena Davis and, to remind everyone of a better similar movie (""In Bruges"" (2006)), Colin Farrell. Anyways, I mention all of this because there's not much to say about ""Ava;"" it's utterly forgettable.There's some melodrama regarding her alcoholism and a love triangle involving her sister's boyfriend, who also has a gambling problem. Oh, and the mom has obsessive-compulsive disorder, so, I guess that checks off the list of simple traits passed off as characters. One shouldn't expect more from a title and protagonist named ""Ava"" as a more complex form of ""Eve,"" who works for an organization referred to as ""Management,"" though. Chastain's character is contracted to murder 41 people--and she kills even more than that in the process--for reasons unknown, and it's not until she tries to steal her sister's boyfriend that she realizes she's a bad person. It doesn't take that long, however, to figure out this is a bad movie.",Ava

16,westsideschl,Not Believable,4,3 January 2021,"Nothing too creative. Script has been done many times before. Very cliche.
Troubled female w/military trained fighting skills now a hired, by some semi-secret organization, assassin. Worst part is somehow a small, at least fifty+ pounds lighter & non-musculcar, skinny female takes out scores of much larger & skilled males. Sure! Usual flying kicks; arm twisting pull overs; near deadly punches. Bullseye shooting under adverse conditions.
The film's theme for viewers is ""Who are you?"" (i.e. Ava) meaning we'll probably get her in a sequel turning her life around.",Ava
17,tabuno,Surprisingly Good on Second Viewing,9,12 December 2020,"Ava (2020). Ten months makes a huge difference. Maybe it is becoming soft and more forgiving or perhaps becoming more mature and astute in discerning quality over a high drama standard. But Ava, the movie, appears to have really become a somehow an amazing assassin movie. The storyline this time comes across clear and poignant, rarely portrayed on film having a substantive, compelling backstory involving the principal characters and her mother and sister. The interweaving of Ava's professional and personal life, the use of some spectacular fight scenes that are quite believable, formidable, and clearly of a quality fashion rarely seen. This is a high-powered star-driven movie that finally comes across as an accomplished movie, more nuanced and qualitative of the by now established ""Assassin"" movie genre that includes (La Femme Nikita (1990); Point of No Return (1993); Leon: The Professional (1994); Enemy of the State (1998); Bourne Identity (2002); Elektra (2005); Shooter (2007)). Starring Jessica Chastain, John Malkovich, Colin Farrell along with Geena Davis and Joan Chen, this high-octane action thriller offers a personally flawed principal along with her dysfunctional and potentially caring family. This fusion of personal and professional concepts comes off as credible and compelling. Even the rather soft ending after a strong martial arts performance and final scene has a nice touch, even more deliciously ambiguous than Point of No Return. This movie can be considered as a worthy representative of assassin movies along with The Russia House (1990); Mission Impossible (1996); The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996); Spy Game (2001); The Job (2003); You Kill Me (2007); The Recruit (2003); Salt (2010); Jack Reacher (2012); The Numbers Station (2013); John Wick (2014); Hitman 47 (2015); Peppermint (2018); Killing Eve (2018). 9/10.Earlier review. 12 December 2020. This rather high-powered star-driven movie comes across as a difficult to review, composite of attempts at a more nuanced, qualitative effort at the by now established ""Assassin"" movie genre (La Femme Nikita (1990); Point of No Return (1993); Leon: The Professional (1994); Enemy of the State (1998); Bourne Identity (2002); Elektra (2005); Shooter (2007)) . Starring Jessica Chastain, John Malkovich, Colin Farrell along with Geena Davis and Joan Chen, this high-octane action thriller is infused with a stronger than usual relational family element along with the typical professional killer outline and the potentially personal flaws of the main character. All these themes result in a fusion of both a rather credible and off-kilter movie. The beginning action scenes while seemingly overdone and somewhat artificially created for exciting physical drama are in some ways relatable in a connected way by an explanation later in the movie. The struggle that Chastain's character has with a chemical dependency is both a stretch and an acceptable inclusion from a psychiatric standpoint. Her character's struggle with her mother's past history and her sister and her boyfriend are also fraught with incredulity and yet somehow passes the believability test. Colin Farrell as the antagonist and his climatic scene with Chastain isn't really well thought out and rather poorly constructed while the ending of the movie seems to be cut short and underdeveloped and rather disappointing. There are some moving scenes providing nicely choreographed martial arts fighting, some of the best in-depth, substantive rendition of an Assassin movie and yet taken all together, the movie underperforms and demonstrates that it hasn't reached the bar of completely succeeding in its intentions as a great new classic of professional killer movies (The Russia House (1990); Mission Impossible (1996); The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996); Spy Game (2001); The Job (2003); You Kill Me (2007); The Recruit (2003); Salt (2010); Jack Reacher (2012); The Numbers Station (2013); John Wick (2014); Hitman 47 (2015); Peppermint (2018); Killing Eve (2018)).",Ava

And hoping it would become an assassin franchise like Bourne series. Sadly, the story was wasted. Kind of like a poorly done Bourne movie. An assassin Ava has an awry target. Which puts a target on her back. And lets add a dull sub plot of her trying to take care of her family after she disappeared for years. Boring story. Dull script that does not do anything with the characters.

Jessica Chastain aint convincing as an assassin.
As a fan of Colin Farrell, i got disappointed. Well, he is in good shape but the footage is very less.
So ther is a scene wher the character of Chastain is narrating her alcohol abuse n childhood stuff in a group therapy and jus when poor Tony's turn came to share, the camera cut off, how selfish man.
Gena Davis played an assassin in Long Kiss Goodnight n sad to see her in bad condition, very old n with those plastic surgery lips.

23,southdavid,Not quite Ava-rage.,4,11 January 2021,"Newly dropped on Netflix in the UK, ""Ava"" is an action thriller that ultimately collapses under the weight of trying to navigate the clichés that its assassin story contains, before falling into all of them.Ava (Jessica Chastain) is the top assassin for a black ops company that specialise in all forms of murder for money. She has reliability issues though, given her past as an alcoholic and drug user and following a mission that goes awry, her organisation led by Simon (Colin Farrell) decide to terminate her. Whilst reuniting with her family in Boston, Ava fights for her life and tries to come to terms with her past.It's hard to say what people wanted from a film, if you're not able to hear from them about it, but for me ""Ava"" feels like it's one that 'got away' from what the writer wanted it to be. It's notable that the writer was removed from the picture, following resurfacing of his assault conviction and he intended to direct, as I wonder if originally it was supposed to stick closer to one of the two films that are in here. Common, Geena Davis and Jess Weixler are all in a soapy domestic drama, in which Ava's return to the city opens up old wounds in the family and the reasons for why she left are explored in quite a straight dramatic way. John Malkovich, Joan Chen and particularly Colin Farrell are in violent B-Movie, in which Ava is a hunted but superior fighter who traverses an unconvincing and occasionally ludicrous Boston underworld.Jessica Chastain is good in both halves, but the two films just don't tessellate into a consistent whole and the assassin aspect of the story is one that you've seen done a thousand times before. The fight scenes are OK, but again, done better in the ""John Wick"" films and ""Atomic Blonde"".There are worse films out there, I agree, but Chastain deserves much better scripts than this.",Ava

Jessica Chastain is miscast as an assassin. I adore Chastain in many of her other roles in the past, but she is a character actress and simply not suited to play a butch stereotype of an assassin in an action movie as this. Come to think of it, Jessica Chastain is well into her forties and it is rather laughable to see her fight younger assasins and butcher them without a sweat...More bad: the entire direction is NOT like a butch action movie should be. It's lacking in flashy action photography for example. The soundtrack is annoying, because it is pumped up and loud constantly while there is no action to be seen in many scenes. There is a fluffy, boring storyline, without any spark or punch. Even the presence of the great John Malkovich cant save this picture from drowning.Isnt there anything good to be said about it?

This is an action tale about a female assassin that works for a black ops organization. Jessica is the hit woman-person? certainly not a hit man-that was trained by John, who is now her handler. Jessica has mostly high profile targets-who would suspect a woman?-but she has a problem. She likes to talk to her victims before she kills them. Basically, she wants to know why they are being targeted for her skills and Colin-her boss-doesn't like that. He puts a termination protocol on her and that's when things get interesting. Geena plays Jessica's estranged mother. They have some unresolved issues. There is a lot of good action and fight scenes; Jeff Imada is the stunt choreographer and he was trained in Jeet Kune Do-among other fighting techniques-and has been in and choreographed a lot of movies you would know; Batman V Superman:Dawn of Justice, Fast & Furious movies, Bourne movies, Big Trouble in Little China and They Live, just to name a few.

The premise of the film sees an assassin hunted down due to her interesting style of work.Main Character
Jessica Chastain plays Ava here and she is completely functional in the role, Chastain is a great actress and she does an adequate job in the role. She is good in the action scenes and does a decent job as the mysterious assassin here. But there is nothing unique at all about her character and it is just eye rolling, you are given no reason to care about Ava and when they try and force you to care it fails and falls really flat on its face.Supporting Characters
John Malkovich and Colin Farrell plays supporting roles here and they do well because they are good actors but it is just the shame that the same as Chastain there characters are paper thin and not given anything to work with. The rest of her family troupe are awful and I actually wanted to see them get killed, which doesn't happen too often, I thought Common was terrible and really miscast in the role that he was given.Story
The story sucks, it is so cliché it is unreal. Even now I am still not really sure why the bad guys are after Ava and I am not sure why I should care. This film offers nothing new in terms of storytelling and literally is a tick box of all the generic action stories and does them all really awfully despite a really strong opening 5 mins that is the clear highlight of the film.Script
The script follows the story in being pretty terrible, there is no dialogue that is interesting and the story is written so poorly. It is like the writers for this film watched some mediocre action films and thought we can do that but worse and that is what you get with Ava.Style
The style definitely has some decent action scenes, Farrell & Chastain (and their stunt-doubles) all do a decent job in the action scenes to make it seem pretty intense and brutal when it needs to raise the stakes. But the film doesn't offer anything ground breaking and new, also some of the action scenes are filmed pretty poorly and that lets the overall film down, I just wish the film had continued the style from the first 5 mins as that is really good but it ends up feeling like an action film you have seen plenty of times before and done better.Overall
Overall, this is a poor action film that offers absolutely nothing new to the genre and it is one of the laziest films you will see. Don't waste your time with this film and go and watch any of the John Wick films instead.",Ava

Meanwhile she returns to her Boston home to resolve her family issues.Slightly ill fitting mixture of family drama and assassin on the run thriller, this remains quite an enjoyable turn thanks to Chastain, Malkovich and Farrell as the really nasty guy. Not sure in an age of Keane Reeves and Charlize Theron that the fight sequences are quite as compelling as they could have been. Ok though.",Ava

She proves to be a great choice to lead an action movie. But she's almost too good for this movie. The screenplay can't decide which movie it wants to be; either a assassin on the run story or a dramatic family showcase. The direction doesn't do much to clear it up, having no creative touch. Colin Firth is a decent Villain but the film can't decide what he wants to be either. Other than Jessica, the other big plus is the beautiful scenic spots outside. But alas, Jessica's great and committed Performance remain the only reason to watch.",Ava
31,kirbylee70-599-526179,EQUALLY DEADLY,8,21 December 2020,"Thrillers involving spies and assassins have been popular for decades. Few these days could be asked who James Bond is and not know the answer to the question. But something new has been added to the genre in recent years that's been a long time coming and for the better. Women are now replacing men in lead roles in action films and they're holding their own. Last you're PEPPERMINT was proof of that. Now we have AVA.Jessica Chastain plays Ava, a killer for hire working for a non-descript group called the Organization. The film opens with her killing a member of the International Monetary Fund in France. Before killing him she makes the mistake of asking him what he's done wrong to deserve his death. He has no idea and she kills him anyway.Reporting in to her handler Duke (John Malkovich) she tells him she needs some time off to deal with family issues in Boston. Returning home she stops in to see her sister Judy (Jess Weixler) a local musician/singer. After her performance the pair are walking back to Judy's apartment and we learn more. Their father died months earlier, Judy has had to deal with taking care of the family, she's now involved with Ava's ex Michael (Common) and their mother Bobbi (Geena Davis) is in the hospital.Visiting her mother the next morning Ava is given the wandering child treatment. She left 8 years prior and has never returned, just placing phone calls every 6 months. There is a combative feeling between not just mother and daughter but between the two siblings as well, one having run from confrontation and the other having been forced to deal with the issues left behind.Ava is next seen at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in Boston. We learn more about her, items hinted at in her discussions with Duke and in the opening credits. A former alcoholic and drug user Ava found her father in the arms of another woman. Forcing him to admit it to her mother he instead told Bobbi that Ava was stealing money from him and blackmailed him with the threat of a made up story. This is the issue that drove Ava from home, into the military and from there recruited into the life of a paid assassin. Sober for 8 years with one relapse she hides the fact of her profession from everyone.After her trips to Boston Ava is given a new target, a general located in Riyadh. Seducing him she is to make it look like he died of natural causes. A slip up in intel sends his men in to take her down and prevent his death but they are too late. A battle follows and Ava barely escapes with her life. When she contacts Duke about it he takes the fall for the faulty intel.But it turns out there was no mistake. The top man at the Organization, Simon (Colin Ferrell) was attempting to put an end to Ava and knew Duke would object. Now she has a target on her back and only Duke coming to her defense.At the same time she's trying to attend to lose ends at home. She helps Michael with gambling debts. She tries to make amends with her mother. She sets out to protect her family. And she waits for that final confrontation.AVA is a solid movie in that it takes a well-worn genre and gives it more depth than most. The character of Ava has issues deeper than a desire to kill or a worn out moral compass. She is troubled with her past and dealing with addiction on a daily basis. These would be flaws in most characters but in Ava we see her trying her best to deal with all of these issues, burying them at first and then rising to meet the challenges they provide.Chastain has always been a superior actress. It's nice to see her in a role that allows her dramatic prowess to be on display while at the same time giving her a more physical role than she's had in some time. She's proven she can handle both sides of that coin in the past and does so once again admirably. Malkovich is wonderful here as well with a bit of physicality he hasn't had to use in some time though a good guess would be he has great stuntmen in his corner. And Ferrell shows once again that he is an underused talent in search of the right project. Let's hope he finds one soon.In the end AVA is a thriller that delivers on all marks. Well-made with a great script, top directing, great performances and enough action to hold your interest till the credits roll. If you're looking for something to enjoy this week give AVA a try.",Ava
32,Pairic,Good Assassin Story,7,10 December 2020,"Ava: Jessica Chastain is Ava, an assassin working for an ""organisation"". We get a useful info-dump of her background over the credits, a problem drinker/addict in the past, ex-special forces, 40 kills to date as an assassin. But her superiors are getting worried, she's beginning to question her targets before she kills them. Then an operation goes wrong, she escapes but now must face the wrath of organisation leader Colin Farrell. John Malkovich is her handler and mentor, he tries to protect her. A tale of the world of smoke and mirrors where private contractors are used to terminate those who have become problems. Could be a Congressman, an IMF official, even a German general. Some really great and realistic scenes of hand to hand combat and shoot outs. Chastain is convincing as an assassin and an addict; both Malkovich and Farrell seem to enjoy themselves in this thriller which may in essence be a B movie but a good B movie. The narrative falls down when it deals with Chastain's family but even there we get a good performance from Geena Davis as Ava's mother, It also provides a couple of fight scenes in an old church which is now an illegal gambling den and nightclub. Diana Silvers plays Camille, Farrell's daughter, also an assassin. Directed by Tate Taylor (Ma, Winter's Bone) from a screenplay by Matthew Newton. On Netflix. 7/10.",Ava

It would actually be a solution to the main adversity of the movie, but because the premise is that she drags her work home with her, it's all about survival.Jessica Chastain, Colin Ferrell, and (especially) John Malkovich do an amazing job on rather down to Earth (if a bit psychotic and brutal) action sequences.While there is a lot going on around the story, the real focus, and it's worth it, her just trying to live through the organization she joined which she knows has to end in either her or the company's death.I do feel like the worst of it is just that Diana Silvers sort of got sidelined, but I'm hoping that the sequel will focus on her quite a bit.",Ava

38,arungeorge13,A crappy actioner featuring a solid cast! [+37%],4,22 August 2020,"There's very little in Ava that makes us care for Chastain's titular character or her inner turmoils. Her past is said to be an unpleasant one but for a movie about an assassin, that's typical. The edits were all over the place, with many scenes feeling disjointed. A good chunk of the first hour is just Ava going through the motions - she conducts hits in different countries, her tendency to question the morals of her cases is highlighted, she goes for jogs, checks in to hotels, and takes messages from her superior Duke (John Malkovich, who has no business being in a movie like this, except for the paycheck). Nothing really sparks interest.And with the movie's progression, I wondered if it was this easy for Ava to switch between a stone-cold assassin and someone who wants to reconnect with her family; one that she left many years ago because of her heartless father. The whole thing feels tailor-made for viewers who seek quick resolutions and instant gratification in their films.
The set-pieces aren't bad but nothing too great - the Riyadh one being the worst of the lot. What did surprise me was the short but all-out brawl between 66-year-old Malkovich and a suave-looking Colin Farrell.The film's connective tissue is supposed to be the father-daughter vibe shared between Ava and Duke but it doesn't hit the highs you expect. Part of the blame goes to the sloppy dialogues (the screenplay is by writer-actor Matthew Newton). The biggest problem with Ava is not that it's generic (Chastain is just having fun here), but the fact that we've seen this assassin-taking-revenge plot handled better in other films ('Salt', or even 'Colombiana'). We know how it'll all play out, we know who's getting written off.Farrell looks good but the characterization is so dull that you don't want to know more about him, or his daughter Camille (played by Diana Silvers). The pairing of rapper Common and Chastain doesn't work. The chemistry between the two is practically non-existent. When Ava refers to her mother as 'Ma' and not 'Mum', it felt like a subtle nod to the director Tate Taylor's previous film. I wouldn't recommend this film even to action film buffs; in fact, I'd advise them to keep expectations low.",Ava

Due to time we ended up with the usual stereotyping of ""hoods"" and ""damaged"" families and it all became glaringly superficial.Some of the acting was suspect and John Malkovich merely played himself expertly, Jessica Chastain seemed to rely on cheekbones and a bobcut to get by doing little and Colin Farrell overworked it, the whole thing was ""hammy"".Overall I was bored and fidgeted from about halfway, I give it at most a 5",Ava

It was a pretty straightforward action thriller executed well. It wasn't about another assassin who wants to retire due to some trauma. It was fairly gripping and had some nice surprises on the way. There are two sides to the story: Ava's assassin life and her family life. The film balances both of them well for the entire duration. Another thing that deserves a special mention is the cinematography: it's good to see the camera not shaking too much during the fight scenes and the choreography being impressive at the same time.

44,IonicBreezeMachine,"It doesn't quite work, but there are flashes of good performances",5,19 December 2020,"Ava Faulkner (Jessica Chastain) is an assassin with The Company who has a tendency to talk to her targets before killing them. Because of this, she is seen as a liability by Company management but her handler/mentor Duke (John Malkovich) uses his influence to protect her. Duke arranges for Ava to have some leave, which she uses to return home to address the rift between her estranged sister and mother (Jess Weixler and Geena Davis respectively) but one of Duke's assets Simon (played by Colin Farrell) has plans to eliminate Ava.Ava from director Tate Taylor was a very trouble production, originally intended to be a directing vehicle for the film's screenwriter Matthew Newton, Newton was fired upon revelations of his history of domestic abuse. The movie was then changed from it's initial title of Eve to Ava with overdubing in post supposedly to avoid confusion with the assassin themed TV series Killing Eve. With all this working against it, one could be forgiven for expecting a trainwreck, but despite this Ava isn't bad, but it's not all that good either.The movie is an attempt to mix espionage tropes with the framework of a family drama (think Le Femme Nikita by way of much more watered down Ordinary People). While these two elements seem like a strange mix (at least played straight as this is typically used for comedic effect in films like Grosse Point Blank, True Lies, or Mr. and Mrs. Smith) it does try to create parallels between the family drama in Ava's personal life and her life as a professional killer, but the connective tissue is tenuous at best and the movie is so overstuffed with characters and subplots that it never feels like the drama or the espionage is given enough time to fully develop which leaves both sides rather underwhelming.There are a few good things in Ava. Chastain does a good job playing a damaged protagonist as we see her struggle with alcoholism and estrangement of her family (even if we never get a full picture as to why) and Geena Davis is actually really good playing Ava's estranged mother and his moments of cutting snark but also a very well done scene of emotional vulnerability that does give some level of emotional release to at least one plot thread from this movie. Other actors are a mixed bag, Common, playing Ava's former fiancee Michael I feel was miscast and his subplot involving gambling addiction and debt to a gambling den owner thanklessly played by Joan Chen is so divorced from the focal point of the movie that you could easily cut it out and lose nothing. The action scenes are competent if unspectacular, but they're clearly hindered by budget. This is evident in that the big climax of the movie takes place in a hotel room and feels like a lackluster payoff to the proceedings.Ava is middle of the road entertainment. It's not that bad, but also not that good. It features good actors doing mediocre things and will most likely be forgotten a day after watching it. I do give it credit for trying to approach the Spy/Assassin genre from a different angle, but it's never given the breathing room it needs and feels like two half developed concepts crudely stapled together.",Ava

We all know it is a matter of time before someone ""retires"" you but until then they do the retiring. Funny too because all killers do it for money? How much is enough in this high stakes game? Welcome to AVA who worked her way up into professional murder but I have to say for sheer facts she had too much help from Hollywood a bit. Even in the James Bond early movies, he gets caught and in later Bonds, he almost gets killed but you have to do it plausibly or you cheese it up and it becomes corny too. Here we have a sampling of pushing the limit on this genre. Look, hand to hand combat requires strength, agility and working out constantly or you lose the edge. Think: Navy Seals. They don't do what they do part time but all the time. When they do it, its deadly. Ava means well but her moves are too choregraphed for my tastes. C'mon, fighting 10 guys and winning? Training is one thing and luck another but when you longshot odds and become a type of terminator that cannot be stopped well the viewer starts rooting for the bad guys. This picture comes across as fast money to be made and in return the viewer gets some decent fight scenes and some tension however the viewer is asked to suspend belief too many times. I like Jessica Chastain, Colin and the action but keep it real if you want to keep me interested. You would think that star actors that have connections, experience, money and power would deliver Grade A product. For example, Sly Stallone's last Rambo product was a sell-out and one would wonder why? Maybe they all make these type of un-belief stretch movies for tax write-offs? Favors to friends?

48,bankofmarquis,Great Mother/Daughter scene in the middle of a generic action flick,7,8 October 2020,"To give you everything you need to know about the Jessica Chastain assassin flick AVA is to read the IMDB description of the film:""Ava is a deadly assassin who works for a black ops organization, traveling the globe specializing in high profile hits. When a job goes dangerously wrong she is forced to fight for her own survival.""Pretty generic, right? There are only about a dozen films that I can think of off the top of my head that would fit this description. So...what separates this one to make it worth watching?Not much.Chastain stars as Ava, a deadly assassin who...oh, you get it. When the ""job goes dangerously wrong"", she heads back to Boston and into the arms of her loving family - who want nothing to do with her.Chastain is good, but nothing special as Ava...she seems to be able to pull off the physicality of this role quite well (like Jennifer Lawrence in RED SPARROW or Charlize Theron in ATOMIC BLONDE). The head of the shadowy organization that Ava works, played by Collin Farrell, is generically shadowy and Farrell plays it professionally with a touch of ""over the top"" acting (but not too much). The great John Malkovich is a spark of energy in this film as Ava's mentor. Mr. Malkovich, as is his want to do, eats the scenery in every scene that he is in. Under normal circumstances, this would annoying, but in this film, it is welcome. Ioan Gruffudd and Joan Chen show up (briefly) as adversaries of Ava and all of these components makes the ""assassin side"" of this film work well enough.The ""family side' of this film just doesn't work - except for one scene.Common is just plain bad in the underwritten role of Ava's former lover who is now married to her sister. Jess Wexler is forgettable as Ava's sister (I even had to look her up on IMDB to remind me of who played this role) and Geena Davis - as Ava's estranged mother - looks like she is just there because she owed someone a favor.Except for one scene.And that's the interesting thing about this film. Right in the middle of this very generic, very ordinary film is a ""come to Jesus"" meeting between Ava (Chastain) and her mother (Davis). This scene was ""Oscar worthy"" with 2 very good actresses going back and forth with each other (with Davis dominating the scene). I gotta think that this scene was the only one Davis read when she agreed to do this film and was pouting during her other, generic scenes.Director Tate Taylor (who took over when the original Director was bounced when past sexual indiscretions were unearthed) and writer Matthew Newton bring nothing new to the genre. It is all very...generic. The action scenes are professionally done, but generic. The situations are contrived and...generic. The acting is...scenery chewing generic. The ending is predictably generic.All-in-all an ""entertaining enough"" generic action flick - except for that one scene (and maybe Malkovich's performance), they make it worthwhile.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10 - it really is a ""5"", but will add a point for Malkovich and another point for the mother daughter scene). - and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Ava

To say she carries the movie is a huge understatement.Helping her find her balance her tumultuous life is the legendary John Malkovich as her mentor. As usual, he too shines in his role. Providing the necessary role as well as something of a father figure in her life. The fight scenes are pretty cool. Swift and brutal in many respects.The acting's believable. Geena Davis in a supporting role as her mom has some good scenes. Their chemistry was pretty believable. As for the story, it's been told before but to be fair they do try to make this film stand out. If you ask me, it did fine.If you're looking for a decent movie for movie night, I'd say check it out.

The biggest down fall to the movie is the poorly written script and storyline. No love story, no secrets to reveal, no heartfelt moments, no rooting moments for a character, nothing deep, instead its a depressing average family story with boring drama and an addict trying to stay sober.

Geena Davis is having all the fun in this film, and John Malkovich is great as always. Personally, I think that Jessica Chastain is a little miscast for the role. If her character was more of a spy or a stealth assassin it would've been fine, but she's sort of both - a stealthy infiltrator and a commando-like mass murderer, and her build doesn't really indicate that she can throw trained men in gear the way she does.It would've been easier to appreciate the film if it was clear what was intentional and what wasn't. There are lots of inconsistencies in Ava's character. She does this weird asking questions thing probably to help herself with her conscience after killing ""the people who do bad things"" but she has no problem with killing armed forces that are just there to protect their superior commander, and they probably have families too you know. The ending was also a little confusing, for a second there I thought that Ava and Farrell's character had a minute where they've seen their similarities and probably the film would go for a more creative and weird ending (they probably did that intentionally), but he still killed her father-figure so that would've been a stretch. Instead, they just got tired I assume (like in Atomic Blonde). At some point, I thought the film would get darker and more desperate (I surely would've appreciated this) but no, it just ends with a sequel bait like in John Wick.Having this much dialogue and family drama is not even that bad, the problem is that this combination doesn't work the way they did it. This family is not interesting enough for you to get invested into old father-daughter problems, the love triangle, the gambling subplot, and more. It doesn't help that we did not see how Ava became what she is now, we get a brief slideshow that gives some facts, but that's about it.If it was just an action film, it would've been cliche but passable, I guess. The action is far away from Atomic Blonde levels, there were lots of cuts and obviously Malkovich can't really do this better due to his age. Ava looks scared in most of the action scenes as well. There are not that many action scenes and they are not interesting or pleasant to look at in any way.The addition of the family stuff just drags the film down, IMO.

Really too bad, since the topic could have been the basis for a thought-provoking film. Instead everything is sacrificed for the action-flick viewers, who only want to watch people (men and women) ""kick ass"".At this point in history, too many movies are being churned out too rapidly, and stars with genuine talent are obviously participating for purely mercenary reasons, since it cannot be for their belief in the value of the creation--certainly not in this case.",Ava

From a shoddily written plot which had loosened up quite a bit in the process to a coerced implication of romantic interest & family countenance. It just didn't feel right!The action is fine I guess, keeping in mind, its fair share of competent gunfights & hand to hand combats, subsequently providing subordinate entertainment value. Still far away from any appeasing outcome though.A slackened screenplay failing to deliver justice plotwise which was supposed to be a high octaned one. Feeble nature of the writing; especially on the characters' front didn't help either. Emotions fell flat, inclusion of inessential dramatic aspects made it look ill-suited to the core cause. The reason simply being, individual on-screen personalities never got their due establishment in the very first place.In brief, it was an improper treatment; that failed to bear any fruitful results in the end.",Ava
55,0w0,Unrealistic and 3rd-rate action movie...,4,25 August 2020,"When a 45kg (100lb) woman kicks a 100kg (220lb) man and sends him flying backwards 2meters, then you KNOW that you're watching a bad movie. And apart from the lack of realism that the movie has, there's also the typical plot-holes such as a highly trained assassin going for a jog, but having nothing to protect themselves with except a pocket knife... the movie has such a farcical amount of 'false suspense' and unnecessary hand-to-hand fighting scenes that this movie honestly deserves nothing more than 5/10. Anyone rating this thing higher than 7/10 should have themselves checked for a brain tumor, because this movie doesn't come even close to something like John Wick or Jason Bourne or The Equalizer (which are all 7/10 or higher movies).Honestly, if you're looking for an action movie to take up almost 2hours of your time, then rather re-watch some of the really good ones like 'Man on Fire' or 'Matrix' or 'Terminator 1,2,3' or something like that, because this movie is just plain bad.",Ava
56,nathanmanson,That was genuinely horrendous,3,25 May 2021,"That film was well and truly shocking, I'm genuinely being generous by giving it a 4. The only reason for that is because I've seen some really bad 3's in my time that are a lot worse then that which is really saying something. The actor who played Michael couldn't act to save his life, surely there was better choices then him. The scene where Ava runs to Michael and kisses him and asks him to marry her was so pointless. That entire scene just didn't need to be in the film. They were obviously struggling to spice up the boring film. When Simon and Ava had their fight the Alarm went off and security guards came she walked out with blood all over her face and said ""they went that way"". She's literally covered in blood and just walked out the room why would they believe that. At the end why would Simon all of a sudden just give up and not kill her, he gave no reasoning for it. Then when Ava was following him, he had no idea she had a gun so why would he run away, he wasn't scared before so why would he be scared now. As you can tell not my favourite film.",Ava
57,Alexander_Blanchett,Nothing new but solid entertainment,7,23 August 2020,"The story is not very new and actual very common. We have seen lots of films about female assassins and surely there were many that were better than this. I must say though that this new interpretation by Tate Taylor was at least quite entertaining, even if it doesnt come close to justify the great talent involved with it. First of all we have Jessica Chastain and an exciting ass kicking role. She was really good in it, giving her character quite some edge and playing it off believably. Nice turn for Chastain who usually shines and those kind of roles. In the supporting cast we have Common who is rather underused. Joan Chen who really needed a better role, she was the most comic-like and an sbsolute stereotype. Colin Farrell was okay but that role did not really require an actor of his caliber as besides some good athletics, Farrell did not really have to show anything off here. Last but certainly not leased there was John Malkovich who made the role better than on the paper so that is at least something. Generally all of them were fine enough for an action film like that. I just felt the film sometimes lost itself in its many subplots without going one clear direction. But yeah as its quite short in running, the time passes well and you won't get bored. There are also some little twists that makes it worthwhile, too.",Ava

59,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,6 April 2021,"The stage curtains open ,..In the wake of a resurgence of assassin action thrillers such as ""John Wick"", ""Peppermint"", ""Red Sparrow"", and ""Atomic Blonde"" comes this latest Jessica Chastain entry, ""Ava"". Chastain plays the title character bringing a modern flair to an old story. What the strength of this film comes down to is not the plot, but the execution of the plot, the acting, and the action sequences. Even though we've seen this story multiple times over the years, ""Ava"" still manages to deliver a punch (excuse the pun).It is the tried and true story of an elite assassin who begins to develop a conscience and doubt the validity of their work ... therefore, they have become a liability and must now be taken out - permanently. Ava is our struggling expert in death as she begins to engage her targets in conversation before their untimely demise, asking them what it is they have done to deserve to die. When an assignment in Saudi Arabia is nearly botched and she barely escapes with her life, she decides to return home to Boston after 8 years and finds the home fires are not burning as brightly. But, the heat is turned up when she finds herself the target and now she must kill or be killed.This film does an effective job of setting up the plot and then moving you forward with excellent pacing and action. Jessica Chastain is very good in her role, especially with those she interfaces with - her sister, mother, and her one and only confidant and friend in the business, Duke (played by John Malkovich). The soundtrack sports an industrial, dance vibe that is fitting to the overall atmosphere and feel of the film. The cinematography is very good, and the use of colors, shadows, and lighting is spot on.I would recommend this film to both the action fan and fans of Jessica Chastain. Even though her supporting actors have put in rather plain performances, especially on the part of our film's villain, Colin Farrell, Jessica Chastain gives us a strong turn that is invested and engaging. I enjoyed this one and hope they will give us a sequel, which is strongly implied by film's end. A solid 8 stars out of 10.",Ava
60,rdoubleoc,"Not that unique, but still very good and entertaining.",8,11 December 2020,"I thought this movie was at least a solid 7 or 8 out of 10, but can see why some people rated it lower. Let's face it, though -- Hollywood is running out of unique stories for movies, or we'd have a unique story for every movie. The best they can probably do now is to make sure whatever the story is, that it's entertaining and watchable, and this movie is at least that.Jessica Chastain does a great job, as well as everyone else.",Ava
61,Stanlee107,The company is going to get you,7,2 September 2020,"This is a decent attempt of a thrilling action film. It is like a female Jason Bourne minus the amneaia that stars the ever watchable Jessica Chastain (Ava). It also has the big old timers such as John Malkovich (Duke), Geena Davis (Bobbi) & Colin Farrell (Simon).The premise is that Ava is a paid assassin that murders high profile people/politicians/traders etc that are seemingly corrupt. Her handler is Duke and they work for a collective group known as the ""company. She has reservations about the ""targets"" and starts questioning whether or not she is given false narratives. This will be her downfall...The chaos and secretive nature of her job is juxtaposed against her social life where she had had a troubled life with family before she joined this company. She is a recovering alcoholic and her sister is now dating her ex boyfriend. Cue the family conflict and tension & also their mother has recently been hospitalised... Due to her work she managed to have disappeared from their lives for 8 months.Overall, the writers are trying to bring some added depth to the clichéd assassin character with some interesting family dynamics. It felt like the film focused more on this aspect which may be off putting for viewers that expect a different type of film.",Ava

Good acting from the cast, but they don't have much to work with and are mostly wasted in this slow and dull movie. The fight scenes are ok, if few and far between and a bit stiff, the locations are underused and apart from the intro, there's no style to it at all.",Ava

65,latinfineart,Not bad. Just not very good.,5,17 August 2020,"I really wanted to like this movie. I'm very fond of Jessica Chastain John Malkovich, and Colin Farrell. Great acting overall, but I have to say I thought Chastain was miscast. I don't think she had the gravitas to pull this off, just wasn't convincing to pull off the physicality, not enough muscularity, too slight a body, just wasn't convinced when she went to battle with these tough guys, that what I was seeing was real.I felt that the movie lacked choreography, especially the first half with the rapid fire shots, all with all the action taking place, you were never really sure exactly what she was doing to take these guys down. In the second half it evolved into some more articulated fight scenes. However, there was way too much family drama. The sister was unbelievably annoying. The mom? Eh? Common? An actor with his chops and presence, should be given more to work with.I would say it was moderately entertaining, but not particularly convincing. It is not a bad film, it's just not a particularly good film. As much as the ending hinted of a sequel, I seriously doubt that will happen. She is no Jason Bourne!",Ava

More drama than action and after a while it gets old.The lead actress is not at all believable as an assassin. The way she holds/fires a gun is bad. All fight scenes are close ups with multiple quick cuts.
She can't run or fight and there are much better actresses to play this character who are already in shape and would have trained for the role.
Bottom line is that she never stepped foot in a martial arts studio and it shows badly.",Ava
67,PyroSikTh,A Good Enough Review for a Good Enough Movie,5,15 December 2020,"Ava follows, you guessed it, Ava. She's an ex-military assassin who has started asking questions into her chosen profession. Not crazy questions, mind you, just asking her targets what they think they did to deserve a hit. Apparently that's all that's needed to cause anxiety in upper management, enough to put out a hit on their own. Yes, we've seen this story a million times; assassin or spy who is the best at their job suddenly finds themselves on the wrong side of their own organisation and must fight off their own. Except Ava attempts to flesh this out with some pretty solid character building and backstory. The title credits is a montage of Ava's entire life history; from innocent child to rebellious teen, from alcoholic drug addict to black ops, to recruitment as an assassin and a hint of all her past work. But the movie makes a big point about her history before she joined the army. She's a recovering alcoholic who goes along to AA meetings, constantly has her past behaviours shoved in her face by her family, and attempts to make amends with everyone she used to know back home. It does add an extra layer to this typical kind of action thriller, by giving us a truly flawed protagonist who could relapse at any moment.The problem is this splits the movie fairly evenly down the middle, between the assassin conspiracy and action setpieces, to the family drama and character study of a broken woman. The two sides of the movie never meet. The stakes of one do not affect the stakes of the other in any way shape or form. We get an entire sub-plot about her ex-boyfriend, who is now shacked up with her sister, and his crippling gambling addiction. This works for the family drama as it adds extra avenues to explore different types of addiction. It turns half the movie into a story about addiction, the problems it can cause, and the struggles it takes to stay on top of it. But how does it factor into the assassin conspiracy? It doesn't. How does the assassin conspiracy factor into the family drama? We see her struggle with her alcoholism throughout, side-eyeing bottles of vodka throughout the movie, edging ever closer the more oppressive and stressful everything around her becomes. She advances to sniffing it, and then to downing half the mini-bar in her hotel room. And then...nothing. She continues to act perfectly normal like none of this had any effect on her at all. She takes on the gambling den and her oddly vengeful boss while under the influence, but seemingly not impairing her ability to do either in any way. Guess her addiction really wasn't that debilitating after all...?The action is, honestly, pretty dull. There's no hook to keep you coming back for more. There's no sense of storytelling in the fight choreography. It's just a series of cool moves vaguely strung together. Except the moves aren't all that cool either. They're the usual punches, kicks, jumps, and chokeholds we've seen a million times in a million other movies. The camera work for these fight scenes is terrible as well, throwing out all the innovation of recent greats like John Wick and Atomic Blonde, and instead opting to go back to the shaky-cam and quick cuts of the Bourne and Taken era, making them almost unintelligible to watch.
The acting isn't too bad, all things considered, but that's hardly surprising with a cast like this. Jessica Chastain proves she's still a very talented actress who's just stuck doing lacklustre movies. She appears to do a bunch of her own stunts, while perfectly handling the harder-hitting emotional beats as well. She single-handedly makes the struggles of her character something we can sympathise with. John Malkovich and Colin Farrell play off each other really well, which is to be expected from actors of their level, while Geena Davis and Common just sort laze through it, delivering their lines without any sense of passion for the quick paycheck.Ava is one of those movies where, at every stage of the production everyone looked at what they achieved and said 'good enough'. The acting is good enough, the writing is good enough, the story is good enough. We'll throw in some neat backstory to make her flawed and relatable. That's good enough. We'll make the reason for her organisation turning on her the fact she asks too many questions. That's good enough. We'll write one musical theme and repeat it ad infinitum. That's good enough. We'll have some punching and some kicking and some shooting, and someone gets thrown on a table at some point. That's good enough. Well, in response to that, I give this movie a 5/10. It's an enjoyable enough waste of an hour and a half, and that's just good enough.",Ava
68,ethanbresnett,"Quite generic and nothing special, but entertaining in the moment",6,20 December 2020,"Ava is one of those films that is enjoyable, but will quickly be forgotten. It doesn't have any major or glaring flaws, but equally it doesn't have anything extra special that makes it stand out.I absolutely love Jessica Chastain as an actress, and so she was the highlight for me. I thought she brought a good performance to a character who, despite not being too developed, had enough to maintain my interest.The story felt very familiar. If you're into the action genre, you won't find anything ground breaking here. That's not to say it wasn't enjoyable. It was fun to watch, it just hasn't left a lasting impression on me.In terms of the action, once again it was exciting, but it wasn't anything new. There were some pretty decent set pieces and some good fight choreography, and the action was well paced throughout.Ultimately I'm happy I watched Ava.

Lots of shooting, hand to hand combat and Ava working through some stuff with her family.Gena Davis plays Ava's mother, John Malkovich her handler, and Colin Ferrel the one who wants her out.

In the film, however, you prefer to use the scheme F, so that you have the feeling that you have seen everything in ten other films of this kind and the authors can't think of anything new.

Jessica Chastain kicks ass and Colin Farrell is terrific. The script and story are redundant to the point where it's exhausting to watch these films over and over again.

Most of the cast has a weird delivery to their lines, and I might like to blame the direction instead of them.. Well, maybe not Common's, whose way of talking felt childlike in a way I never noticed before (he is a rapper or something? Will pay attention to his next role). Aside from mostly everyone, Geena Davis (mother) sells her scene perfectly.

81,ginocox-206-336968,A mismash of familiar tropes with an excess of emotional baggage,3,25 August 2020,"Ava (2020) is about 75% chick flick, 20% action/thriller, and 5% what Roger Ebert would have termed a cigarette-smoking movie. The chick flick portions are a dreary mix of alcohol and substance abuse, sibling rivalries, family betrayal, domestic discord, and daddy issues. The daddy issues spill over into and often overshadow the action scenes, where the protagonist's mentor is a surrogate daddy figure confronting palace intrigue orchestrated by a pretender to the throne.The action scenes are well done with excellent fight choreography, but too few and too far between, and are nearly always confined - to a single room, the back seat of a SUV, a patio deck or a small section of a jogging path. They are often dimly lit, presumably to hide cables and the substitution of stunt performers.Political correctitude and inclusiveness often proves distracting in recent films, and Ava is no exception. However, the diverse pairings of combatants in Ava prove interesting, with women fighting each other and men, and an elderly man fighting a much younger one. But #MeToo seems to have trumped inclusion, as the assassination targets are overwhelmingly male.Ava is not a particularly likeable or sympathetic character. She has issues and insecurities, no love life, and tensions with her family, employer and ex- fiancé. People fear her and respect her reputation, but nobody much likes her. Jessica Chastain does as well as can be expected with the script she's given - a mishmash of familiar tropes hobbled by compulsory woke elements.Smoking seems problematic. Ava smokes constantly and seems to inhale more smoke than fresh air. The effects seem obvious on Chastain's face, as she looks closer to 53 than 43, but also on her physiology, as she seems perhaps ten kilos over fighting trim. Yet she is supposed to be a top assassin, capable of defeating multiple highly-trained opponents in armed and unarmed combat. The fight scenes are well choreographed and Chastain seems to do much, if not all, of her own work. But when the action slows to a crawl, she looks more like a middle-aged soccer mom than a finely-honed killing machine who jogs for exercise, holds her breath for an extended period, and engages in exhausting fights that last longer than professional boxing rounds.While Ava doesn't seem to have a love life, she navigates her way through two bedroom scenes, but without removing her clothing. Both scenes seem more perfunctory than impassioned.Motivations seem a bit murky in both the chick flick and action scenes. Characters act in manners designed to facilitate plot progression, not as one might expect rational characters to behave under such circumstances. In one scene, a character abandons several weapons and walks away unarmed after a particularly tenacious character threatens to kill him.Ava asks her victims if they know why they're targeted for assassination. She seems to have a deep-seated need to know and to justify her own actions, although she seems remorseless. Yet, the filmmakers never realize that the audience also needs to know in order decide where their sympathies lie.Production values are more than adequate, with credible performances by Chastain, Malkovich, Farrell, Common, and Davis. The action plot suffers from a lack of originality, a surfeit of emotional baggage, one-dimensional victims, a lack of credible response from law enforcement which can't seem to figure out that Ava was in each of forty-one exotic locations at the time of high-profile assassinations and also in several hotel rooms that were shot up, and a more credible protagonist who either doesn't smoke or is actually short of breath after intense exertion.",Ava
82,ayoreinf,"Another killer woman, but this one comes with a baggage",9,25 July 2021,"In recent weeks I've watched three lethal ladies, I've already realized that these movies are bound to face endless animosity on this site but since I like the actresses involved and I'm interested in this new trend. (yes, I'm not denying it's a trend, I just don't mind it, like I don't mind other passing trends) I made it my business to watch all of these movies Like I watched Lucy, Salt, and Atomic Blonde. I hated the first but I liked the other two very much. I don't mind movies about women kicking ass and beating tough man at their own game. I don't feel threatened by this trend or by the movies about such women that predated this trend. I judge them, like I judge all the movies I see according to the qualities I see in them.Well I saw loads of qualities in this one, even though I must accept that the idea of a killer woman with shady past is not new and was presented - in a very different manner - at least in La Femme Nikita (which was made twice, and then got an entire TV series) so this is not an original idea, though I didn't see it yet done with such depth and care to the full details of the sordid past this woman killer is carrying on her shoulders. Personally, I think that's precisely what interested Jessica Chastain - she was given a complete character to play - Just like Scarlett Johansson got when they wrote the Black Widow for her. I said it already many times, but I'll repeat it again - good actors can work wonders when they're getting good roles to play. Jessica Chastain is a very good actress like Scarlett Johansson is and so are the rest of the cast, even though most of them don't get the same character treatment Jessica Chastain got. Still most of them found in the bits they got enough depth to play off Jessica's Ava and in some cases did superbly like Geena Davis and John Malkovich. Common and Jess Weixler are doing just fine too and Colin Farrell is very professional but is definitely short of character.As a rule, this is a character driven story and that's all that matters but every thing else in the movie is done very well and very professionally. Nothing extraordinary but when the characters are so well written and the acting is of such high quality the rest is once again - insignificant. The idea of a killer with a budding conscience as a liability to an organization is once again - not new but it was rarely depicted with such depth and I found it to be a very good bottom line.",Ava

84,bazookamouth-221-898097,I don't think it's as bad as people are saying here but.....,6,2 September 2020,Was Chastain believable with the physical fighting? She took out a lot of guys phyiscally and she looks so slight. Did they have to give so much screen time to the family issue thing? None of the family she had was likeable or relevant to the story. The sister Judy (Jess Weixler) was horrid and the love interest triangle with (Michael) Common was contrived and he is too wooden. Geena Davis as the mom was cranky and spent 5 minutes of the film playing cards with Ava and knocking the table. Why was ex alcoholic Ava able after a off the wagon drinking binge able to defeat fellow trained assassin Simon (Colin Farrell) and why did he just give up and walk away after fighting her for ten minutes only to be shot down in the street hobbling away? Why did Ava smoke so much in the first 10 minutes of the movie then nothing for the rest of the movie? Why does John Malkovich (Duke) sound the same every movie he makes? He is very monotone.

Luckily for this movie I was into it. Though I will mention that Common was dreadfully miscast.
Pretty silly overall, but not a bad story. Worth a watch.",Ava
86,SamJamie,An entertaining & fun spy thriller.,6,29 January 2021,"An assassin becomes marked for death by her black ops organization after questioning orders and breaking protocol.""Ava"" brings the action and espionage elements of a classic spy thriller blended with family-based drama. The mixture of the two isn't always seamless but it doesn't make the film any less entertaining. Chastain is great as the lead with her opportunity to participate in the genre, bringing the charisma and star power that saves the day for Ava. Otherwise, it's an unimaginative plot with less thrill and many clichés. Ava's atmosphere is due entirely to its compelling action sequences and strong supporting performances... Farrell did a great job and there's a wonderfully acted scene between Geena Davis and Chastain towards the end.",Ava

Firstly, the plot it quite simple, it shows the world of professional killers, also it has a lot of predictable moments. Secondly, the cast is the best of this film: Jessica Chastain, John Malkovich and Colin Farrel are awesome. Thirdly, the action itself is good, but no outstanding.

88,elliotte2,Jason Bourne vs Point of No Return vs Homeland?,5,10 December 2020,"This movie could have been so so much better. It had the right actors(Jessica Chastain, John Malkovich, Colin Farrell & Geena Davis), had some interesting hand-to-hand fight scenes and though cliched still effective emotionally flawed protagonist.But three really really big mistakes by the director/writer kept this move from being a highly rated action thriller.1. Way too much unnecessary melodrama. Her backstory was complicated enough but they add an additional complication which has no purpose in the film just to cast a well known actor. Several times the film came to a halt when this 'extra complication' was on the screen.2. Protagonist makes three decisions that an ordinary dumbest criminal would not make. It is so obviously badly written scenes that it makes movie almost laughable. This is a highly-trained international assassin that been able to be cloak and dagger for many years, please do the character justice and not have them so something on the intelligence level of a 14yr old junkie. Yes, the decisions are that bad.3. Motivation: I have very little reason why anyone is doing anything as there is not enough character backstory to make you care. You cannot appreciate or understand how things are if you never knew how they were. Characters appear, given a name and proceed with an action that you are unable to invest in.While this sounds bad, the acting(Chastain, Malkovich and especially Geena Davis) saves the moves and makes it somewhat watchable...for me. The 1 or 2 star reviews are just people being negative, this movie ranges between 4 star to 7 star depending on personality.",Ava

You will also be treated to him nearly kicking the **** out of Colin Farrells character, which is something you won't see everyday.

93,itsbobr,Terrific Assassin Story,9,1 October 2020,"Ava (Jessica Chastain) is an Assassin working for a Black Ops organization called The Company headed by Simon (Colin Farrell). Ava likes to ask her marks if they know what they did and deserve to die because of it, and this rankles Simon who feels she is a liability and wants her dead. Ava's Handler, Duke (John Malkovich), does his best to protect Ava and wants Simon to rescind the Kill Order.This is a little different Assassin story as we see some Soap Opera stuff thrown in with Ava's family who she hasn't seen in 8-years. Even so you must know by now that I like Assassin movies and even some bad ones are still good enough for me. That said, this is a very good one with a mix of Soap Opera family stuff and keeping Ava alive when Simon wants Ava dead. Oh, Ava is a former Alcoholic with PTSD.Notables: Common as Michael, Ava's ex from long ago and now engaged to Ava's sister Judy (Jess Weixler); Joan Chen as Tony who runs a gambling operation and Michael is on the hook to her for $80,000 and Ava will try to get him free of Tony; Geena Davis as Bobbi, Ava's mother. Diana Silvers as Camille, Simon's wife.As we go along we have all the confidence in Ava and she is in the class of other Assassins: Ana, The Red Sparrow, and, of course, John Wick among others. So do we miss the tension and suspense that is not in here? No, but some of the fight scenes do have us questioning who will be the victor.I do hope that John Malkovich does more movies in any capacity. He is always more than good and deserves an Oscar just for appearing in any story, just like Woody Harrelson. Enough said.Now at the end when we see Ava walking away and we see a girl following her and we think it may be Camille, but no, it is the girl we saw on a motorcycle who listened in to Ava and her mark in the beginning of the movie, but we never saw her again until now. So for a moment we thought there may be a sequel, but we think not. But a sequel would be welcomed anyway. (9/10)

95,carlos37andre,A weird one,5,30 December 2020,"I'll start with the positives, this is a gorgeous looking movie, the cinematography, directing is great, it's beautifully shot, and for that, I wanted it to be better than it actually is. I like the little bit of information we got from this organization of sorts, with assassins, the whole hierarchy, but they never really bother to explain it more. The acting is great, there is so much talent here, Jessica Chastain, John Malkovich, Colin Farrell, a lot of great actors, and they do a good job.The action scenes are fine, nothing that will jump the eyes, but nothing that will take you out of the movie. Some of them are cool, like the one in Saudi Arabia, some are a bit forgettable, like the climax of the movie.But man, the script is just, idk, it feels like at times a lot of pieces of information are just missing. Like, for example, what is the reason Simon wants to kill Ava? Is it because of a thing she did two years prior? Why just now? After she already reestablished herself? They never truly explain the reason why she must die, and since this is like half of the movie, it's just difficult to stay invested in the story, when you have no idea why you should be.In the beginning is also weird to get when some of those scenes take place, like the one in the beach, where she is talking to Duke, was that just before she went to Boston? But didn't we have already seen she talking about that with him on the phone after the job in the beginning? It's also hard to fit the job in Saudi Arabia in the timeline as well, so... that happened before the one in France? If so, why would they continue to give her stuff to do? And, again, so she decided to go to Boston not after the Arabia job, but the France one? Which again, it was clearly a success, so if she continues to work, why would she want a break after a successful job?It's also really hard to just know where the focus of the movie is, I feel like so much stuff in the family storyline just doesn't get solve, they through in the problems with the dad, which I guess got solved in one scene with the mom. The dude kisses her, while waiting for a son with her sister and... I guess that's ok too, we don't need to address it at all.And the ending is just where the story truly goes sideways. First of all, why would you call her? And also send her the video of Duke's death? For real, how stupid is that?! You've seen what she's capable of! Aren't you supposed to be the brains of this whole organization? And... why in the living hell, would you go alone? Not even a car? I mean, really. And the worst part is that, he just LEAVES her there!!! Why?!! Omg... You just killed Duke for... nothing? What? Even if you succeeded in your escape, that wouldn't make any sense. And, idk, there is just no real ending, so I guess you are just setting up a sequel? Or not I guess, cause his daughter could just have killed her there at the next turn.Also, the scene at the end where she goes to Toni... if you wanted to pay her, why kill a bunch of people? And get beat up like that? Why?Idk, to sum up, Ava is a weird one for me, I think there is a lot of talent on screen, the movie has a great cinematography, it's beautiful to look at, and I wanted it to be good, but the story is just a mix of stuff, that doesn't really have a north, they try to do a lot, the motivation of some characters aren't clear at all, some storylines are just not solved, and... the movie doesn't really have a ending too. Just a missed opportunity all throughout.",Ava

Let alone the belief that 3 white women from MA all have this affinity for a large black man.
The pointless attempts to establish this backstory of Ava as an alcoholic/drug addict is just completely pointless. The only piece missing from this train wreck is they needed Michael Bay to direct.
The other reviews are right, the plot is contrite and although the action sequences are mildly entertaining, they cannot carry an entire movie.
The basic plot being that the recovering addict assassin is marked for death by her own people (Colin Ferrell with a porn-stach), basically because of her own existential crisis.

It tries to be more than what it is by adding an addiction element but it just doesn't work for this kind of movie. Everyone hum drums along knowing that this is just a paycheque. In some ways it reminds me of a poor man's A Long Kiss Goodnight, almost like a 20yr sequel to the original but definitely pales in comparison. I was kinda hoping Geena Davis would turn into some kind of badass rather than just a crap mom.

134,moorek,There is half of a good movie in there...,4,14 December 2020,"If you fast forward through any part of the movie where Ava is talking with any of her family then you have a fairly well paced 40 minute movie worth watching.This is an action film and not a character piece. There is not the time to develop the background of the flawed main character. And what they develop is some insecure main character that surely would have failed long before this point in the movie.The subplot of leaving the sister, the boyfriend and the mother slows everything down. It is not developed well enough to give the characters any depth. It was unnecessary. Even worse the other subplot about the gambling and the gambling establishment is nothing by a distraction. The core story of the movie is a hired killer who is being removed. It's been done before and much better. But this organization would have sent their best after her and there should have been those battles - not some artificial battles with gambling thugs. Although still better to watch Borne fight against other trained professional for the third or fourth time than watch this.Chastain is not right for this role. She does not have the build or the character for it. Malkovich just delivers his lines for the pay cheque but sadly has been doing that for many roles these days. Farrell's involvement is similar.Like lots of these movies it does silly things like try to have us believe that a fight between Farrell and Malkovich would take that long or even with a drunk Chastain.In the end it is that dumb movie plotline that it is better to kill someone instead of just retiring them. In this type of movies, this makes sense, and the Malkovich character should understand it. He's trying to be rational in a non-rational world.We've seen it all before and normally done better. It is still worth a view on a lazy night but you'll likely find yourself fast forwarding.",Ava

Or I should say what it's advertised as and what you think it is going in.Where the movie starts and where it ends are two different things. That could be a good thing or a bad thing. In this case I'd say it more the latter.It's obviously not what you expected it to be. It goes deeper into the character than you would generally expect. Trying to be smarter? Trying to be different? Trying to be artistic? Trying to not be the typical Hollywood type of move? I can't really say. But how deep they took the character didn't really work for me and given other lower ratings I would say consensus agrees. I don't mind the depth but they spent too much time there. It's almost like how they have advertised this as ""one of those"" types of movies was just a hook to get people who normally wouldn't see the type of movie it became.I'd love to say more but I think that would give away too much and just become a spoiler.If your expecting a kick but and take names power woman action film, well it's kind of there but not that as much as you might expect. It's more of a subplot to draw you into another type of movie.If you like the actors it's worth a watch but the big names don't have big parts. There's some great action is it but again don't expect it to be filled with it. Otherwise if you have a passing interest without high expectations, appreciate movies that also aren't action, or need something to watch to fill the time go for it.It's just okay, or maybe a bit better.

The scene where she fights Colin Farrell was good and i wish there was more of that.Overall it's pretty forgettable stuff which is a shame because i was hoping it would be better than this.Check out Atomic Blonde, it's a similar kind of movie which does pretty much everything Ava tries to do but only 10 times better and more convincing.",Ava

There are plenty of reviews already so I'll just add what I thought was refreshing about the film & what I thought could've been better.
Most films about assassins - Bourne, Wick, and Atomic Blonde come to mind - depict them as somewhat aloof and mysterious. This film grounds our assassin as someone closer to a real person. A human being with proper foibles who exists among other imperfect people.It's a smaller budget film but the cast is killer (pun intended). Seemed like it was shot fairly quickly but the actual performances are proper top shelf.Ideally the action needed to appear less ""choreographed"". Just as it depicts Eve as a real person, the fights, too, should have been more ""warts n all"".
Felt like I was watching two different movies: gritty American family drama and then a European espionage thriller or Jane Bond 007.
This movie tried to bridge the two genres & that's what I enjoyed most about it.",Ava

The action scenes, screenplay and the story itself doesn't deliver anything special at the table. Overall its just a time pass movie.",Ava
145,peter-laganis,Michael ruined the film!,6,26 August 2020,"The first 30 minutes were really promising.
Good action, suspenseful vibe, great acting... but as soon as one of the secondary character Michael appears, everything flops.
Not only because of his insecure and awkwardly mediocre acting, which reminded me of some cheap drama or love story soap opera... but because he represents an entry point into Ava's past. A boring past which has nothing to add to the story or her character.So if we crop off all the family stuff and stick to the action... then it could be a solid 7.
In stead it is a poor 6.Worth mentioning:
Jessica Chastain and John Malkovich performances are great. Colin Farrell somehow sticks to his (good) average, but who really disappoints is Geena Davis. Her approach personally felt to me like ""Let's make it clear - I'll say some words, get the money and leave.""",Ava
146,movieliker1,Typical action movie,6,19 October 2020,"I didn't think it was as bad as most of these reviews say it is.
Is it formulaic? YesIs it unnecessarily heavy and melodramatic? YesAre there silly and contrived plot holes? YesAre the fight scenes ridiculous and unrealistic? YesBut most action movies are, and do have such nonsense. (Especially with female leads.)Reviewers are complaining Jessica Chastain is too small and skinny to be beating up men. And then they want to compare her to Charlize Theron. Charlize Theron is skinnier than Jessica Chastain. So is Angelina Jolie. It's usually ridiculous when women beat up men. But hey, that's the movies.Jessica Chastain is beautiful, a good actress, and I think she did a good job with the fight scenes. Jess Weixler and Dianna Silvers are beautiful also.
(Geena Davis was always ""meh"" to me. Even in ""Thelma and Louise"". Good movie but Geena Davis was nothing special.)I saw the ratings before I watched it.

148,PerryAtTheMovies,"""Anna"" was a better film...",5,4 December 2020,"Initial Thoughts:
The first thing that comes to mind upon finishing ""Ava"" is ""Wow... That was bad."" This film was the longest hour and a half of horrible hand-to-hand combat sequences with a bunch of unrealistic gunfighting I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, there seemed to be no passion in how the fighting sequences played out and that was only part of the downfall to this film.Going further into passion, or in this case, emotion. There was none. From start to finish there was no true build-up that lead to a fight or an ""emotional"" family conversation. Everything felt so bland. None of it felt convincing enough to say, ""Yeah, I feel for them"", or ""Heck yeah win this fight!"" The easiest way to describe this film is a cross between the ""Bourne"" and ""John Wick"" series, but with worse choreography.Possibly the only good part of the film was the story. I could feel where the director was coming from trying to make this a movie about a woman with hard pass who overcomes life's difficulties and becomes this killing machine. Unfortunately, the intention and execution are at opposite ends of the spectrum, and as stated above, causes this film to fail.Before I get to my overall portion I will say this. If you're looking for a film that offers a kick-ass female lead, with a great story, and worth your time. My recommendation would be to watch the film ""Anna"" (2019). I don't have a blogged review of the film, but I did rate it 7/10.Overall:
Not a very engaging film. For all its many action sequences, this film falls through the cracks for me. Not emotional. Not long enough. And not even an ok execution of the story. This film I wouldn't recommend, but I would recommend ""Anna"" (2019) (7/10).Enjoy the show!",Ava

So I watched the whole film this time and decided to make things fair, and it should be 3 stars(or less) instead. 1st, john said '' Ava is the most gifted talent"", but somehow she made silly mistakes on every single mission, I wondered how bad this organization was. 2nd, Ava was a drug addict 8 years ago, and her ex-boyfriend asked her to marry him 8 years ago, and now 8 years later the ex already proposed to Ava's sister, wat!??? 3rd, Colin killed John, the first thing Ava thought of was to run away with her ex, yes!!! thats her sister' fiance, then to pay off his debt in the most crowded public, then back to hotel got drunk, umm.... did she know she was going to chase by the organization?

In this film her portrayal of a dysfunctional assassin is less tragic than it is aggressively tedious. With the exception of Malkovich every other actor in this film is similarly flat and boring. Even then the Malkovich role could have been done by a stuffed toy so wooden is the direction for the character. The score is interesting until it plays all the time at which point it's simply annoying. Fractured plot lines and incomplete subplots remove any sense of tension and poor directing eliminates any chance of compassion for the heroine.

This is exactly what this film is, a different flavour of a similar genre.During lockdown people must have gone bonkers to give good movies ratings of 1 and 2. I honestly have no idea why this has any rating lower than a 6. We are talking 1 to 10, so a decent film must receive 6 7.

The story is solid, it explains clearly why things happen, why she asked the questions and what the repercussions were so whoever said it doesn't explaint it, clearly wasn't paying attention and who the hell analyses action films, are you looking for a realistic spy/assassin movie?

164,mr_sharma,This is a live review - reviewing it as I watch,5,8 December 2020,"OK. I have never done this before. Reviewed a film whilst watching it.But Ava turned up on Netflix, today, and I already had thoughts on the film so why not.So I've currently paused it around the 14:45 mark.A few things occurred to me. Firstly, it lacks that Hollywood sheen you normally get with thrillers. It almost feels like they had some budgetary constraints. Secondly, It seems fairly straightforward so far. Thirdly, the direction seems a little off, as if this may be the director's first or second film. As an example, there is a singer on stage and everyone in the audience is dutifully lined up, no pockets of people, just uniformly spaced out people (both in the literal and metaphorical sense) just nodding their heads gently to a ballad. It's like the director said, ""right you lot, stand there look like you're nodding to the music"". Anyway, initial thoughts. Back soon.Ok, back now (18:32). Just a quick note. The writer(s) has(have) added a few nods to us oldies (lines like ""Hey Jude"" or when Geena Davis is introduced they reference her disappearance from our screens of late and also a nod to ""the long kiss goodnight""). Also, even the camera work looks amateurish. There is something TV movie about this (and I mean late 90s TV movie). Let us watch more.26:44 - So our introduction to John Malkovich....in Normandy France. Now I'm getting the impression someone has pulled strings to get some of these actors into this film because they took a crew to France (I honestly think they did) rather than have Malkovich travel (he is a French resident). Anyway, let's carry on. Surmising. None of that is true (probably). On a side note, you can tell two seasoned actors who know their craft when you see Malkovich and Chastain together.34:45 - I really wanted to know Tony's (the alcoholic) life story. Oh well. Back to the plot.44:30 - actions sequences are a bit meh (well you just have to look at the action stuff everyone else is coming up with to realise this is meh). In any case, I'm getting into it. The ""big name"" actors are definitely holding this film up.54:05 - Pffft. Pointless side story with pointless action sequence. I'm now getting sidetracked here. The script is a little bit here and little bit there. It's lacking I'll be honest. I'm really not caring about many of these characters. Still now I'm nearly an hour in, let's carry on. May be the third act improves. What is this film trying to be?67:23 - This film really doesn't know what it wants to be. It's a bit of this and a bit of that but nothing complete. It's got action sequences with moments of supposed ""pathos"". Just isn't working and I am getting bored and uninterested. I can only guess (and hope) soon enough they're gonna throw in a mega action sequence.71:52 - there is a lot of ""buzzwords"" to do with spying, thrillers, espionage, assassination....code words, protocols and so on....like there is a big organisation which this film will never get into. Just talks the talk but does not walk the walk. At least when John Wick uses words like parabellum...you find Out all about it....this uses management and such....but who the hell are these guys? Banging my head here.75:14 - you know that scene in Austin Powers when a henchman gets killed and then there is this little side joke about no one really thinks about the henchmen's family, his dreams so on....well I'm beginning to feel sympathy for the henchmen in this film. She's been paid to kill 41 people...but absolutely zilch to kill the thousands of poor hard working henchmen. Honestly, a henchman in this film is turning out to be like a red shirt.86:55 - Ok decent fight sequence and unnecessary let's stop and chat a bit moment but ok that perked it up a bit. Now we are heading to the end. It doesn't make sense what just happened. If I was going to want someone dead, I wouldn't personally do it....if I was the part of an organisation that had lots of people to do it for me.89.59 - acting still good (ish) but simply put this film is frankly not worth wasting your time over....and it ends.

Chastain's character and Malkovich's character could never be serial killers; they are too nice and too moral. The boyfriend would never take the ugly, angry sister over the beautiful, rational one. This film is an entertaining but confused mess.",Ava
172,mrfrane,Embarrassing and derivative,4,18 December 2020,"Well, clearly they can't only be Charlize Theron, even with a suitcase full of wigs. Completely predictable story because it's been cobbled together from a score of really good international assassin stories. Chastain clearly has no martial arts training and the fight scenes are unbelievable and just bad. Ava clearly isn't John Wick, either, although we are meant to believe she is. Lots of decent actors working with a terrible script. I'm not sure if this was originally meant for theatrical release but everyone involved should be glad that didn't happen.",Ava

But even Chastain couldn't save this turkey. The whole backstory with her family was boring and irrelevant. The addiction part I suppose was intended to give her character depth, but it was just tedious. And the fight scene in the nightclub was just embarrassing. Colin Farrell's character had potential but was underused.",Ava
174,bostonct,"OK Movies with a few popular, easy to watch actors",6,19 October 2020,"Not bad. Jessica Chastain is a good actress but this one might be too much for her. Anna, Atomic Blond, La Femme Nikita are better femme fatales. John M. is always nice to see on the screen.",Ava
175,MackMonMay87,"Unless You're Really Bored, Av-oid Ava",6,30 December 2020,"I've gathered from other reviews that Ava was produced by Jessica Chastain, and directed and written by actors who were friends and co-stars of hers. That explains a lot about it. It very much feels like a movie her and the cast made for fun; as if she watched Atomic Blonde and Haywire (superior versions of what we see in Ava) and said ""I want to do that too"". Except when you're as rich and famous as Chastain, you can actually do it and convince high caliber actors to star in it.Ava is yet another entry in the growing subgenre of skinny white women who are either spies, hitwomen, international assassins, or some mixture thereof who have tortured pasts, have at least one scene where the lead wears an elegant dress and still kills people in it, and has a fight in a hotel room with a male opponent who either betrays her or is in some way a part of her organization. Seriously, both of those exact scenarios happen in Atomic Blonde, Haywire, and this. Except out of those 3, Ava is by far the most boring and poorly executed.
It's a very weirdly hyper-specific set up in this subgenre that for some reason keeps happening. I haven't see Luc Besson's ""Anna"" or ""Red Sparrow"" with Katniss, but I wouldn't be shocked if those also had a hotel fight scene with a man connected to them somehow and/or a scene where either of them kill people in an elegant dress. This formula is getting old and tired, and while I'm happy to see women getting a piece of the action pie in cinema now more than ever (there's been tough women in cinema since at least the early 70s however), lackluster entries like Ava indicate that female-led action films desperately need to innovate. This is so unbelievably plain, bland, and by-the-numbers without inspiration. The supposed novelty and shock value of her being a woman assassin isn't enough to make it interesting. I'm sure some would say I'm a bigot with an axe to grind against all womankind because I thought it was bland. That defense against female-led material is also getting tired.You can only do so many storylines in a 90 minute to 2 hour long movie about assassins, and trust me, Assassins, John Wick, Leon the Professional, The Long Kiss Goodnight (coincidentally starring Ava's mother) Haywire, and more are all more worth your time, feature superior action, locations, and inspiration, all while possessing the exact same tropes and story that Ava has. Special ops assassin with a rocky past has a kill order placed on them by their command, and now they have to fight the very organization they were a part of. Not only movies, but comics, anime, and video games have done this story to death, and Ava refuses to even make an attempt at a unique spin on it. Sure, she's an alcoholic and apparently gambled in high-stakes poker (hello Molly's Game!), but these elements don't really affect her character that much, or the story.
The assassins, including Ava, are some of the dumbest in the genre. These people apparently don't know about poison, cutting brake lines, explosives, or using high-powered long distance sniper rifles. All of which would be cleaner and more efficient than the kills seen in this flick. A gunfight happens in a public hotel and nobody calls the cops, just hotel security after a 5 minute long prolonged battle that people would hear happening. No authorities and police exist at all in Ava. In an absurd sequence, Colin Farrel's character, who is the supposed head of this assassin group and a deadly operative in his own right, shows up with seemingly no trap, no plan, and no escape route planned in advance, with no support weapons like a knife, garrote wire, baton, tazer, or anything else aside from the one pistol he brings. All of this despite his supposed experience and knowing all about Ava's skills in advance. Ava kills him because he didn't think to call an Uber, a taxi, or have a getaway car waiting after he shows up to a contract. I was laughing as he was limping through downtown Boston for blocks and blocks on foot with Ava following, Farrell never thinking to head to a crowded area with witnesses or steal a car. God forbid there be a vehicle chase in an action movie. Another scene features a supposed ex-French special forces member assigned to kill Ava who's master-plan is to follow her on her jogging route and attack her. Why would someone who kills for a living have a predictable, regular running route in open spaces without people around? At night? It seems like it's rolling out the red carpet for being sniped. But our French assassin doesn't think about that and instead tries catching up with her and knifing her, then shooting at her with a loud pistol in a public park. Again, no authorities show up despite the fact that people even from several blocks away would be able to witness that a man is assaulting a woman at night. I thought the fact that Ava even visits her family still, otherwise living and acting like a normal person with a demanding job, was a ridiculous choice. I wonder if real-life professional killers go home and play hearts with their mom? I wonder why Collin Farrell's character never used her easy-to-discover family ties as leverage against her when he wanted her dead? Sure is nice for Ava and her loved ones that's he's such a kind killer.You can't give half scores on IMDB, but that's what Ava deserves, a 5.5. I barely gave it a 6/10 because Chastain, Farrell, Geena Davis, and Malkovitch have some moments where they're entertaining. All of these actors can and have done so much better than this. Ava is just barely above Bruce Willis and Steven Seagal's straight-to-DVD dreck these days, by a very thin margin. It's common for people to complain about superhero movies replacing traditional action movies, but if this is what action is going to be like in this era, maybe it should die. I only watched Ava because of the boredom brought on by the pandemic, something I find myself saying about a lot of reviews on here lately. It's fun to point out the flaws and shortcomings, but not much else about it is worthwhile. If you're reading this after the pandemic is over and you can go to a bar and restaurant safely again, do that and skip Ava.",Ava
176,jackdeth_2006,"It doesn't tred new ground, but treds old ground competently",7,30 December 2020,"Assassin films are a genre to themselves at the moment. This one has the full on assassin 'industry' structure of John Wick, but never reaches those heady heights.Chastain and Malkovich turn in good performances and Colin Farrell doesn't do a bad job either.The human element of this film centres around Ava returning to her home and family who have all changed significantly since she left, but this emotion pit is an element of the film that doesn't work so well, although Gena Davis still puts in a good performance there.The sub plot around a bizzare love triangle never really does anything but slow the film down and the gambling issue alone could have provided what was needed without all the additional angst.It's certainly not a bad action film. The fight scenes are well choreographed and don't resort to Matrix style martial arts, and the characters slow down as the fight continues which is something a lot of action films get wrong.It doesn't do anything new for the assassin genre but its not the worst film in it.

182,smithpaulusmc,Not the New John Wick,3,19 December 2020,"Ava follows its titular protagonist (Jessica Chastain), a dangerous ex-addict who struggles internally as she works as the world's finest assassin. Ava wonders whether the men she is killing for money need to die. After a botched job, a member of her black ops organization (Colin Farrell) wishes to have her killed to protect the company. Yet, Ava's keen wit, skill as a martial artist, and help from her trainer (John Malkovich) keep her alive long enough to find closure and face all who want her dead.In as few words as I can describe Tate Taylor's latest spy film, Ava is an exercise in character creation only. It is baseless, without story, absent of strong acting, and wholly incomplete. While still better than the vast majority of today's straight to streaming movies, I judge Ava harder because I know the skill of the director, who previously directed The Help (2011), and the cast, known for such works as Interstellar (2014), Being John Malkovich (1999), Selma (2014), and The Lobster (2015).After the first 30 minutes of mostly coherent character introduction and world building, the movies slips into an odd commentary on family life and relationships that have been affected by Ava'sbehavior in a previous life. And for all the emotion and raw exposition, the audience does not feel a single bit of sadness or remorse on Ava's behalf. Instead, the audience is left questioning why it is so seemingly easy for Collin Farrell's character to undermine a full world of assassins and name himself leader. The audience is bored by long, winding takes of one-on-one dialogue that features a grand total of three tripod-based camera shots.Perhaps Ava was an attempt at creating a female John Wick. Had it succeeded through the use of clever writing and dynamic locations and color palette, Ava may have been the action film of the year. Instead, Ava leaves much to the imagination and asks the viewer if the film industry is really worth saving if this is what a star-studded cast of house favorites gets you.",Ava

Problem (in my eyes) was the plot that did make this flick and all action thriller. Because the tears and the telenovela subplot deflate the excitement, preventing the film to reach an awesome peak that would have made it truly memorable.

Common is badly miscast and is utterly charmless as Chastain's Ex. Hard to see either her or her sister falling for him. Geena Davis has little to do and doesn't add much in a listless performance. Jess Wexler can be appealing but it just a drag here. Malkovic and Farrell are 2 of the more singular actors around and they come out ok but this film could and should have been so much better.

She starts asking her marks what they have done to deserve having a contract put out on them before ending their misery. This does not go down well with Simon (Farrell) who seemingly leads the shadowy organization of contract killers and is the protege of Duke (Malkovich) who is Ava's handler. Simon tries to have Ava killed by sabotaging one of her missions and fails. He then sends another assassin who also failed. Since Duke is in Simon's way, he dies. Then Simon goes after Ava, alone and out of practice, without back-up. And he fails to finish the job. Ava coolly chases him down and finishes him off as he attempts to limp away. Where are his accomplices when he needs them? Then the final scene shows Simon's daughter tailing Ava, hinting at an impending sequel.

However, as she relapses into alcoholism and a mental breakdown is on the way, the company deems her a liability and wants her gone. In sceneries reminescent of the John Wick movies, like hotel rooms, a flashy nightclub and abandoned church, she fights both physically and mentally to protect herself and the ones she loves.Or at least, that's the premise. In reality this straightforward storyline gets sidetracked a lot by Ava trying to reconcile with her family whom she abandoned, trying to save her ex-boyfriend from bad apples, and Ava's mentor trying to save her. It took the strength and pacing out of the story, and took precious screentime away which I feel could have been used for making Ava's mental ""breakdown"" seem more convincing.
Technically, the movie had some flaws. Unfocused shots at times, the action scenes had an abundance of shaky cams and jump cuts (which I dislike), and digital zoom-ins made the editing just seem... off.However, Chastain was not a bad actress in this movie by any means.

She's a decent actress & does a pretty awesome job of being bad ass but not in your hair/make up always perfect cliche kinda way.

237,felix-wyderka,Ava is a predictable mess with no thrill.,4,30 August 2020,"Ava is the newest action picture starring Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark thirty, A History of Violence). Chastain is a very capable actress, especially in dramatic roles. Ava, however, is a role that doesn't suit her. It's a role that involves fighting and many cold looks and a certain amount of toughness (I am thinking about Charlize Theron in Atomic Blonde or the Old Guard) that Chastain simply doesn't have.
Ava is an assassin that, we are told early in the movie, has battled with addiction to alcohol and pills. This backstory would be interesting if it had any impact on the movie's events. Let me give you a quick insight.
The movie starts with Ava picking up a target and after having a friendly chat she climbs in the back seat and has a friendly conversation with him before she kills him. She asks him why someone wants him dead. This comes up a lot in the movie but it is never clear why Ava wants to know. The whole sequence takes about ten minutes and is extremely uncomfortable to watch. Mainly because Chastain doesn't look comfortable. She doesn't look cool and calculating and heartless but rather confused and a little unsure and trust me that's not the character.
After Ava gets rid of the body she meets her handler Duke (John Malkovich, giving his best to a thankless and flat character).
We can deduce that Duke and Ava have more than a professional relationship. They're more like father ran daughter.
Duke gives Ava her next job where everything goes wrong and she has to run from the people hiring her.
I will stop with the plot here but trust me it doesn't get better.
Duke's boss Simon (Colin Farrell) is such a flat and unexciting character that I wonder how he made it so high in the organization. Farrell is a very capable actor and he tries to make the most of Simon's shallow character. I can't help but wonder if it would haven't have been a better movie with Farrell's and Malkovich's roles reversed.
Over the course of the movie, Ava has many scenes with her family, and part of her backstory is revealed. But rather than doing this through flashbacks, there is a very boring monologue held by Chastain about what happened to her character. Even more confusing is that her ex-fiance is now engaged to Ava's sister. In fact there are so many issues Ava has to clear up with her family that it feels more like an episode of This is Us than a spy thriller.
The whole first half of the movie has about one exciting scene, which in my opinion is way too short. It's a scene where Ava has to fight her way out of a hotel after she is being chased by a horde of bad guys.
And while this is a very exciting scene and the fight scenes in general are the best part of the movie, we can see that they are staged.
If you look closely you can see the actors react to a punch before it even happens and in instance, jumping out of the way, a long time before something is thrown at them.
In a movie like this, I expected a big showdown or a big twist that changes the whole perspective. Something that would make the whole affair a little more exciting and at least give us a thrilling ending. Instead what we get is a boring and predictable finish, that makes the whole movie even worse.
The only grace in the movie is John Malkovich. His usual calm and calculating demeanor is the best thing about the movie. His character, like all the others, is underwritten. Malkovich makes the best of it and he actually does a decent job. He has the rare talent to change his demeanor from sincere to threatening in a millisecond which really helps his character.
All in all, I can say that Ava is a movie that boasts with it's star power and then lets them fall flat.
I can only advise you that when the movie comes to theaters in September, save your money and go spent it on something nice or maybe another better movie.",Ava

The casting was completely wrong with this movie. The characters had no on screen chemistry and the movie was patchy and terrible. Regurgitated story with same old father figure character with hidden past that creates this monster of a character with anger issues.

248,nellz_nivlecn,Did jessica chastain & john malkovich shorts on cash?,5,20 September 2020,"Seriously why though? Why did this movie has so many good actors playing in it?
This is one of those female contract killer we've seen plenty of times in hollywood, like Salt and Anna. They all pretty much rely on a same trope which is contract killer wanted out and got chased by their own boss. The thing is, unlike Ava, Salt and Anna have interesting thing going on for them, they had meaty backstory, interesting characters, great plot and satisfactory conclusion.The only good thing about Ava is the opening scene with Jessica chastain and Ioan grufford, an assassin asking her target why they were targeted, it was interesting, it tells us the audience that perhaps the assassin grew conscience about what they were doing. But no, she was just asking so that her boss getting pissed and wanted to kill her.The main character, Ava, was so unlikeable. She's poorly written , there's nothing that made me connect or sympathized with her.
This movie adds so many unnecessary things and hoping it would make a good plot. An alcoholic, troubled family, love triangle between twin sisters, mafia boss, etc. They wanted this movie to be more than your regular assassin movie, they wanted drama and instead this movie plays more like a TV movie drama.The performance is nothing spectacular, nothing that stands out. The action scene was also just your run of the mill fighting, even seems terrible sometimes, which in my opinion is a CRIME in an assassin movie, you have to HAVE great fighting scene/action sequences.

257,zadok-332-444684,"Generic, decent entertainment",6,23 August 2020,"It's hard to say what this movie tries to be. An action movie? A spy thriller? A hired killer's psychogram? Jessica Chastain sees to it the latter works, but it doesn't seem to be the intended focus. The ""thriller"" aspects are rather bland and predictable. If we consider it ""decoration only"", then one could say it is working in that modest fashion. It is however nowhere near a ""deep intrigue"". The facade of a spygame may help to establish suspense of disbelief, if barely. Personally I found the few drawn out action scenes a bit misplaced, taking themselves too seriously to be a good Bond'ish ""super agent joyride"", but still not ""realistic"" enough to hold my breath in suspense. Personally I like female action heroes, but if they take several punches from a trained man (be it just that cannon fodder soldier) w/o any visible effect I can no longer go along with that serious attitude. Not that a woman can't believably win - it's just that they should do so in a different fashion. Athletics, superior technical fighting skills, pain resistance, surprising a male opponent with unexpected ferocity: There's many things I can believe. This very feminine agent however should not be asked to pull off the toughness of a Brienne of Tarth. Not even once. That's just killing immersion. Also it is either unnecessary (for the spy game), or not enough (for an action flic).
Overall nothing is really bad here, but nothing is outstanding either. There's several masterful actors here, starting with Jessica Chastain, but it's not the kind of film to really build on that either. Kind of a waste really.
Everything is decent, some of it pretty good even, but... nothing is committed to. Ultimately I've enjoyed it and didn't spot any ourageous flaws, so the 6/10 can be called deserved. My excuses to the cast here: Simply can't justify a better rating.",Ava

The choreography of the actions scenes is great, and the characters of Ava, Duke, Simon and Simon's daughter all play for an interesting dynamic, except the depth ends there. I think this could've been a really good story if there was more time to flesh it out, we're told that Ava's dad was a terrible person and she sees John Malcovit h as a father figure, but we never really see them have a father/daughter relationship, all their interactions seem very get down to business rather than affectionate, especially from Ava's side. There's a whole side plot that's not really fleshed out about how she used to date Mike, who is now engaged to her sister, but again there never seems to be any genuine feelings there that could make me care about the characters relationships. The strength comes in the action scenes, which are brilliant but the story and the characters needed to be more fleshed out. Why was Ava talking to subjects such a problem in the first place? Why is Simon in charge and Duke has lost his power? What's the back story with Simon and his daughter? Mike is mentioned to have a gambling problem but it's just thrown in there to give Ava a scene of beating people up rather than because it affects the story in any way. You could cut all the scenes about Ava's family out and it wouldn't make a difference, there's no emotional weight behind any of them, althogh not without the director trying.",Ava

Well, I can now safely say that ""Ava"" makes that piece of absolute rubbish look like a cinematic masterpiece. You would think a film with great actors like Jessica Chastain, John Malkovich and Collin Farrel couldn't fail, on how wrong you would be. What you get is another run of the mill story about an assassin, except this time there is literally no story.

Who cares if an international assassin is curious about why? If she still gets the job done, what does it matter? And yet this is the central point of the story.

I don't usually watch fight scenes, but when Jessica Chastain fights, actors are going home with bruises. There were no action doubles, Colin Farrell and Chastain were getting hurt.

The reviewers giving it low ratings don't realized how programmed they've become, so can't tolerate anything outside of their software. Solid performances by all, especially Chastain and Davis, who also have some original dialogue in the mix. I especially enjoyed the opening credit sequence and all of the backstory it provided so economically. It got a bit lost in the middle, but found its way in the third act and had some enjoyable and sometimes brutal sequences. Didn't care for Common's performance, but he had a supporting role so it didn't drag things much. Sort of set itself up for a sequel, but I'm betting they don't go there. Check it out!",Ava

This aint no John Wick I get it so me expecting action choreography was a bit much but action scenes felt so lumpy.. so edited.. so chopped that I just didnt get to annoying anything.

But what they did was fail to tell their own story well. For one the movie centers around intelligent and skilled assassins and has all these ingredients for real intrigue but fizziles out with the antagonist and supposed assassin's boss running to a conviniently secluded spot that would facilitate killing him inconspicuous.Even the way the movie ends you can tell they are pandering almost off-puttingly to requests of a sequel, which a really good movie need not do.the even more frustrating thing because it had all the ingredients to be great (great cast, great premise, etc) but could have done better with unpacking the plot and making the fights more believable and compelling.",Ava

Honestly, there's absolutely no redemption for this movie. As with most movies, I use Closed Captions cuz I like the total experience of knowing what's being said in the ""background"" as well as making sure I can understand what's being said in general especially when strong accents are involved. That said, I'm so happy I did it with movie cuz the dialogue was incredibly lame thru most of this hot mess so I muted at those and just read along all the while groaning to myself ""they seriously did just say that!?!?!"". I also FFd thru some of it too cuz I just wanted some parts like the fight scenes that I usually get stoked at watching women kicking ass (girl power) ~ ie. Milla Jovovich, Kate Beckinsale, Geena Davis (""Long Kiss Goodnight"" top fav & freakin' rocked!!!) ~ were just like watching sparring matches between beginners, even for the guys, to be over with already.The story itself is somewhat typical though they tried to change it up but that didn't work. Woman, former alchi & druggie, somehow gets in the Service then gets recruited to be a contract killer.
Then they throw in too slowly and unnecessarily a sister who's engaged to your ex-boyfriend, who has a gambling habit & a mother who let her own daughter leave thinking that she believed her husbands' infidelity was a lie. That's
just sadistic and cruel. Why were these storylines in this movie? They certainly don't help you ""like"" or ""root"" for any of them. But I guess they were trying to give us some kind of backstory and why they're messed up alcoholics, gamblers and a paid killer.And OMG the ending between Jessica & Colin was THE WORST!!!!! How the heck could that ever pass as ""good writing""??????? And then it got even worse, couldn't imagine it could get ANY worse but it did, with Jessica, Common and the sister (forgot her name...oopsies, but I actually don't care). WTH?!?!I do not know how or why this movie got made, just do yourselves a favor and skip it. I watched it for John Malkovich and I honestly regret giving up my precious time to watch it.

Just goes to show that even one of the best in the business, Jessica Chastain (who is in practically every scene), can get burned by a poor script and bad direction.Indeed, even a stellar supporting cast including Colin Farrell, John Malkovich, Geena Davis and Joan Chen can't save this pointless, disjointed action flick from heading straight into the bargain bin it belongs in at Walmart (or Amazon).The 'story' is all over the place, with way too many superfluous side plots like the needless mom and daughter/s angst, ex-bf angst, killing ethics angst, gambling debt angst... yeah, you get the idea, adding nothing but run time and groans to the proceedings.*Spoiler** Such a senseless waste of talent. Case in point... why on Earth does Farrell's character just show up at a hotel looking to kill 'Ava', then ludicrously walk away after a bloodsoaked stalemate and end up getting shot by our anti-heroine walking away down the street nervously looking over his shoulder. Ludicrous.Mind you, you have to admire co-producer Chastain's optimism... Ava actually sets itself up for a sequel.

The lead Ava, played by Chastain, is likeable and someone we can identify with on some level. Malkovich gives his usual great performances as ever.The real problem I have with the film is the casting. The actor who played Michael was badly cast. First off, he can't act. He sticks out like a sore thumb in the film - it's almost like they chose him to play the token black guy. The casting director should have chosen someone better, regardless of colour. I seriously would have have issues with an all-white cast.Geena Davis is a huge disappointment. She looks like she's ""acting by numbers"", literally just rattling off lines in order to get her paycheck and go home. She no longer has a 'sparkle' to her performances.Either way, it's still a decent way to spend about 90 mins of your time.

events were transferred to another suddenly and unconnected, for example, a problem was raised in the film that AVA faces an ethical problem in killing without knowing the reason, but her bosses do not allow Speaking with the target. and from this standpoint, the film suggests that this is the main problem that the hero must search for, in order to complete the story. but on the contrary, the author transferred the problem to another form completely.The combat scenes are in vary between good and acceptable, but there was slow combat movements and clearly tacky, but they are made good enough to be viewed, and this is a major weakness in the film, which is classified as action and speed.

367,healingtoolbox,"Much better than reviewed, wonderfully crafted, NOT Michael Bay",9,22 November 2020,"Much better than reviewed, this movie appears to suffer from severe critic-itis, where familiarity breeds contempt for narrative and entertainment value.
I notice jaded, negative reviews from men, women and user-reviewers. The movie I saw had great humanity and said a lot about individuality. This is NOT a Michael Bay movie of cardboard cutouts. Other reviews complain of ""soap opera"" writing. I disagree. Every development of supporting characters bears on main character's development and arc. If soap operas were written this well, I'd be watching them.This is basically Atomic Blonde 2.0. Jessica Chastain watches Charlize Theron produce and star in Atomic Blonde. She says, ""I could do this; and maybe, do it better.""I suspect the bad-ass female Bond-spy-assasain--done with any integrity--starts with Luc Besson's La Femme Nikita (1990), perhaps the most likely pop-culture origin of the Marvel movies Black Widow. Then we have Hanna (2011) and Atomic Blonde (2017) among a few others.Ava (2020) is in this line. It betters Atomic Blonde in its character development and sequel set-up. It falls short of Atomic Blonde in fight chereography. Jessica generously gives the best lines and good scenes to her supporting cast--not often done. Geena Davis has the most surprising character arc of the film.Jessica chose her scritpwriter with care, All Matthew Newton's scripts are about real people with real emotions--not Michael Bay cardboard cutouts. Ava is about people also, bettering Atomic blonde on this count also. Colin Farrel and John Malkovich are at their best, not phoning in their performances.Jessica is still beautiful to watch. Her final makeup, probably chosen from a dozen, sketches is very striking. The end allows Jessica an interesting feminine twist on Terminator unlike anything in recent memory and nothing like Cameron's female terminators. Nicely done I say. Good narrative set-up for a sequel.",Ava

Because she went a bit off script?Why did Ava question earlier assassinations? Was there a shady agenda and she was killing the wrong people?The fight scenes were really well choreographed and the acting of the main characters was fine for this sort of movie.Common's acting in this was wooden and felt very much like he was going through the motions.I think if the plot was tighter and had more direction this could have been great.

And the part about her drunk background, it contributed much to her story. For crying out loud, her files explain why she joined the military and ended up as an assassin. Her file said she was a good soldier but also a liability because of her behavior and that explains why she was attacked. The Duke was killed in defense of his favorite protege. For Christ sake I can't believe I have to explain this to people-why some events happened in the movie.
If one pays attention, you will realize that the intro gives all the background info there is to know about Ava and the actress did her best to portray these qualities. My point exactly is people perhaps didn't see that part of the movie and therefore couldn't appreciate it. Also if you watched the intro and careful taken your time to read her files, you'll realize that everything adds up. In order words if you skipped that side of the movie, then don't watch the movie at all.",Ava
376,jakedogoe,I think the movie was great,8,17 September 2020,"Everything needed to know about Ava was in the intro of the movie.

Nothing you haven't seen before in a Hollywood action movie, with the exception of some things being done worse here.What really irks me is how Ava has a lengthy fight with someone in Boston Common, one of the busiest parks in the city regardless of time of day, and there was no one around / no reaction to the fight or a gunshot right by the street in the park. There's suspension of disbelief, and there's bad writing. You decide.Skip.",Ava
378,joedkat,Absolute trash.,2,16 September 2020,"Other reviewers here have made numerous great points already as to why you should avoid this mess..Jessica Chastain, John Malkovich, and Colin Farrell do a good job, as expected. However, the writing and directing are horrible. The fight scenes are boring. The visual effects, while not overly abundant, are very poorly utilized when they do appear. There are countless, useless story plots. The decisions some of these ""trained killers"" make is absolutely ridiculous.A shootout in a hotel in Boston? No problem, it'll take 180+ seconds for an alarm to go off or for anyone to even react. A big fight in the middle of Boston Common, the biggest park in the downtown area with constant foot traffic regardless of time of day, along with ANOTHER gunshot in the park, and there's NO ONE around and no reaction for at least 90 seconds. If you've ever been to Boston, you know the BPD are ALWAYS around the downtown / Boston Common area. That, and there are also pedestrians all around the park at all times of day.The subplot with Michael (Common; a supremely talented musician, but a not-so-talented actor) and Ava's alcoholism are both ultimately pointless.They set us up for a sequel, too. Good luck to us all, we're going to need it.",Ava
379,masterlu-1,good fun very violent action killer woman flick,8,3 February 2021,"Very good graphic fight scenes that expanded chastains acting range. i was surprised that she was able to play an action star so well. previously, i thought of her only as a dramatic actress. Nothing really original - super lethal killing machine chick looking for revenge but very well done. Ending was a little odd. Spoiler alert: Her ex boss becomes a complete idiot in the final battle which takes a little away from the believability of the story. Makes 2 weird decisions, after fighting her without killing her, he simply walks away and apparently does NOT expect her (a super assassin) to find a spare gun and follow him! Then he has no escape plan or vehicle: he has to actually WALK for miles to get away!
But I thoroughly enjoyed the fast paced story and excellent fight choreography and blood and how she really look like she got beat up.

381,irishmonster,Yeesh...,3,15 December 2020,"Well, for all of the well-known actors in this film, it is certainly a disappointment. The story is extremely predictable, in that it has been done, and done, and done again. The acting is pretty bad all the way around, and given that the production is awful, the story, as mentioned above, is typical of your straight to DVD movies, a few completely bad actors thrown in the mix (Common, I'm looking at you), and the sheer lack of believability in the fights, it's hard to find any redeeming qualities in the recognizable actors performances.",Ava
382,kappachino,Family drama with mediocre action,5,27 January 2021,"I got duped by another misleading trailer.
Advertised as a slick Luc Besson-style femme fatale assassin flick a la Nikita or maybe Atomic Blonde,
Ava is actually more of a quiet character study that takes you into the life of an assassin and explores their personal life, family, and the burgeoning doubts she has about her career.Make no mistake, I'm a fan of Jessica Chastain since I saw her in Zero Dark Thirty and can't wait to see her in the upcoming spy thriller The 355. She is a great actress and appears to handle her action scenes well. Unfortunately, for an assassin movie there just isn't enough action scenes. I expected a few memorable scenes that would warrant rewatch but there's nothing to write home about. There's just much talk and too little action.The acting all around was good though, and it was nice to see Geena Davis act again, playing Chastain's mother. Rapper Common and the girl who played Chastain's sister were also decent. Also strange to see veteran actress Joan Chen in the cameo she has. John Malkovich was good as her mentor and father figure. Colin Farrell chewed the scenery as the obligatory company man.All in all worth a rental if you're a Chastain completist, but if you're looking for wall-wall action you'll be disappointed.",Ava

Who the heck decides to cast John Malkovich and Jessica Chastain as marshal arts super-agents? Neither is at all believable in these roles, not to mention pretty much everyone else in this forgettable movie.

I don't understand how cool actors like Jessica Chastain, Colin Farrell and John Malkovich could have starred in such a stupid and banal film. I can't praise them, and I can't scold them, they were ... they just were. The main character is very incomprehensible, I do not want to empathize with her at all, the minor characters are also very poorly spelled out their motivation is stupid. The only thing I liked was the soundtrack, it was good, but otherwise the film is bad. The director tried to make a drama / action movie about a hired killer showing how poor and unhappy she is so that we would feel sorry for her and empathize with her, but she does not show from the good side, and therefore it is simply unrealistic.",Ava

There a lot of triviality in this movie, very superficial scratches of the characters that make impossible for the viewer to feel anything watching this. Perhaps the worst thing to me is the attempt to give some profound meaning to Ava doubts on her killings, talking with her subjects to understand why they have to die, and then she completely forget these doubts and kill a lot of people without any problems. All the ones of the military police for examples, men that are only working for a general, with their families at home. The pointless shooting at the game room another. It seems that this movie is for ignorant spectators: give them a bit of ""something that seems profound"", a bit of ""pure stupid action with deaths and guns and punches"", a bit of family problems, add also a bit of a social and psychological problem like the alcoholism, mix all together even without a real logic and the people will love the movie.

From the first scenes you can't believe Chastain's character is what they are trying to sell us. She doesn't have the physique, the dexterity and the technique to be a full metal assassin. It's just unbelievable. Even her acting is sub par. The lame and slow choreography of the fight scenes makes things even worse. Big names like Malcovich or Davies just got onboard to cash their much need covid-relief check. This is a lousy movie. It's a bad copy of a copy of a copy.

And she has daddy issues. But, get out of her way! There's nothing Jessica can't solve with her fists, her feet, a gun, harsh language and a full clip. Included is a John Wick nightclub moment.

The fight scene are slow and you almost feel like that are repeating the moves while filming it. They try to make Jessica Chastain do some John Wick moves, but it's just not believable and not only for her. The gun fight are ridiculous, the bad guys run to her gun and die one after another.

We've had Red Sparrow and Anna in the last few years and both of those films were better than this. The premise that's been done before isn't what made it bad, a bad script and okay fight scenes did. In the end, it was the overall shallowness of everything. Jessica Chastain's character is concerned with the morality of a kill (do they deserve it?), but we know nothing about whether her employer only accepts hits for ""bad"" people or if it's a pay-to-play situation. Who is Duke and what's the background between him and Ava? Who cares if Ava asks her targets what they did to bring an assassin to their doorstep, so to speak? If she makes her kills then why does corporate care if she asks the target's questions? Little reason behind the killing within the organizaation and why the heck would Simon kill Duke (his mentor) if he ultimately stops trying to kill Ava and tries to walkaway? It's asinine and the driving force that should have been there as a result of Duke's death is stollen when he does walkaway. The one good moment for me was Duke, who was lying there dying, telling Simon that he was disappointed that he wasn't going to be there to see Ava rip Simon's heart out. The fighting was mediocre and I didn't buy that Ava was beating up people left and right because it didn't look like the type of fighting required to accomplish that.Her family's story was the only real story we got and her mother was irritating. Her sister was mad she left, mad she showed up and she flip-flopped back and fourth with no depth so that it seemed like she was just mad no matter what. I feel like I've seen Common act halfway decent before, so I don't know what happened in this movie but it was hard to watch. The only bright light was John Malkovich, but this was hardly worth his time. Watch it if nothing else peaks your interest.

And with those exceptions at hand, it plays the opposite of that.The films hits as it was rushed, as the actors could not work long on their scenes, and the action scenes where limited by budget and time constraints.
The editing also sometimes hurts, as some of the action scenes are messy and even normal conversations are thrown off by stressed cuts.There is so much room here for something amazing, a female jason bourne with a proper story and in-depth personality is probably some of the goals. But it plays of as one mixed the dish together a bit to fast, like someone kept telling them to hurry.
Also there is a suspected unbalance of the budget, as it is used on all of its major actors present. And then the unbalance pushes the remaining film schedule into a stressful venture.Everyone in their leads play their scenes as good as they can, the support cast is not weak, they just lack a depth, the action scenes work sometimes but then fails on their next interconnected scene, when it just looks bad.

In addition to that, the relationship between Mentor and Mentee (Duke and Ava) brings a strong fatherly figure into the film that makes Ava's story a little less boring.

587,christoph_ascher,Wow! A thriller with depth and accelent acting,10,23 October 2020,"We all know, it's a matter of taste, after all. And thrillers with depth are just my personal favourite.
The character Ava gives us something new, somethnig we haven't seen before. While we have seen hundrets of one-person killing machines, this one has a real, realistic and understandable history. And not only a history, she has got a present, which means: real issues besides her current job. The viewer gets to know her problems and issues up close. The scenes and dialogues with her sister, her mother, her ex fiancé are atmospherically dense and paint a really three-dimensionl picture of the main character and her social relations.
Honorable mention: Who knew that Geena Davis could act like that!!??
For me, the best one-person killer movie since 'Leon: The professional', and nearly as good. Very similarly to Luc Besson's hitman Leon, in Ava, we get to know the hitwoman as a torn person struggling to get whole again.

As a result of her unpredictability, Ava becomes the organisation's target for elimination which leads to a series of violent events.Despite the tragic consequences, as in the famous line from Herodotus' retelling of the story of Croesus and Solon: ""Count no man happy until the end is known,"" one can still die happy in the comfort of knowing that their families are safe.",Ava
592,horrorfaninusa,Not Well Done,4,26 August 2020,"Bad editing and directing makes Jessica Chastain look ridiculous in the action scenes. Editing is choppy so, we can't clearly see who's hitting who from where and the fighting choreography is so unimaginative that it almost bores you to death with its mundaneness. There isn't a single scene where it makes the audience wow with excitement. It's that bland.On the other hand, the actors' performances shine through the well written drama scenes. That's when you understand why the producers preferred this heavy hitter cast list instead of going with B names and saving some money.However, too much heavy drama causes the film's pace to suffer significantly. It's like we are watching two completely different films at the same time. At the end of the day, this was supposed to be an action movie so, unnecessary dramatic set pieces and monologues disappoints the action movie fans who were in their seats to see Jessica do some really bad stuff rather than seeing her cry in her luxurious hotel room.That's something I never understood either. I thought a black ops operative with a target on her back would rather pay cash to stay at a sleazy motel instead of checking into a five star fancy hotel.All in all, I suggest you skip this one and watch one of your favorite action movies instead.4/10 for bad action scenes, boring cliche plot, bland fighting choreography but decent dramatic performances.",Ava

I often found myself thinking about other things during dialog so I often didn't even remember what was just said.But yet, after missing half the dialog I didn't feel as though I missed anything by movies end.The acting is pretty decent except from common.

That way you won't have to choreograph fights by having a huge ripped man walk up to her, put his hand in her shoulder and then throw himself to the floor.1 star for Colin Farrell and John Malkovich who can be entertaining even when phoning it in; and 1 star for a reasonable (if unoriginal) soundtrack.",Ava

In my opinion, it does not deserve the bad reviews at all. Granted, it's not a superlative gem of a movie, but it definitely has its qualities. We watched it in a group, and all agreed that it was a good action movie.Personally, I liked the fact that the female lead (Jessica Chastain) is not infallible, nor indestructible. In fact, she gets thrown around a lot, which is a lot more realistic than the usual indestructible characters. As a killer, she re-discovers her conscience, and primarily thinks of her friends and family. As a result, the movie had a realistic feel to it, which made it more enjoyable. The ending was also good, without being hollywood cheesy.Will recommend this for a good action movie.",Ava

Was this written by an AI that doesn't understand emotions and how people actually speak to each other?We've a leading female character who doesn't seem particularly strong but she can single handedly take out a small well trained bunch of guys by hand or by gun.The editing is poor as well. The audio isn't always in sync from one cut to another, the director seems to think he can use digital zoom (cropping) and nobody will notice how blurry the resulting image will look. Well, we do notice these things.I didn't give a toss about what happened to any of the characters, and in a week I won't even be able to remember what happened in the movie.Go watch a Neil Breen movie instead.

This film did exactly what it tried to do, which was to entertain us, not to win an award for Best Dramatic Movie of 2020. Instead, it gives us an American classic story of the assassin who is developing a conscience and ends up being the target of her colleagues. It's fun and has some twists that were enjoyable, even when we might have predicted a few of them. While it's not a new plot, it was fun to have a female in this role, and Ava is every bit as interesting as Jason Bourne. I found the characters acceptably drawn for this genre, with the exception of two minor characters (her former boyfriend and younger sister.)

In Greek it means ""life"", and yet her trade is death. In Irish, Ava is the most fearsome warrior, and she certainly is that too.
From the first scenes, Ava is looking for meaning. She's also fighting her personal demons. She's into philosophy and the viewer also needs to see beyond the violence and ruthlessness to the subtle subtext.
Ava is not a killing machine, she feels, she thinks, she struggles. Will she be victorious, or defeated?
I disagree with those reviewers who only see the surface, the action and the battles, and are irritated by the ""gratuitous family scenes"" that don't seem to add to the story. Those scenes are the real story.
Matthew Newton knows what he's writing about. The top-flight cast signed on because they saw what the story was really about, and chose to be part of it.

The movie beautifully depicts the moral issues that Ava, the main character, is encountering, in choosing between what is good and evil, and she is having this wake of consciousness all over her through her contracts to kill people.
Yes... I can almost hear you screaming 'clicheee'. Well to some extent you are right in that every modern action movie is adopting the same plot. But hear me out guys! The movie has none of those inspirational cringe songs which are played gloriously when the main character is beating the living heaven out of the ""bad guy"" (pun intended). The movie starts (kinda) with a scene of Ava quoting Solon, ""Count No Man Happy Until the End Is Known"". And the movie ends with the same quote too, and not in a shabby or clumsy way that many other nth rated movies are choosing to adopt.
The intense emotions between Ava and her mother and their past is absolutely nothing short of delicate. So stop wreaking havoc on this movie man.

8. Simon and Ava fight. Just...wth happened? They just stop fighting? Seriously...Simon just stop trying to kill her and walk away and what? So Ava can have time to chase him with a gun? And why does Simon walk? Oh So he comes to the hotel walking? No car?

Everything about it is so fake, including taking the trigger off a glock? Stupid. Has so many stupid one liners it makes you cringe. Fake fight scenes, fake shootings, fake injuries, and fake technique on how to properly choke someone out. All could've been ironed out if these actors would have taken a day to learn the basics.

Yes I am saying that, who has the time to say such harsh things on a film that's actually decent, this is my first review and probably last because I know these same neck beard/ Karen's love crying about details.

It's not going to go down in history as unforgettable or win a bunch of prizes...just like one million other decent and good movies haven't. But if you sit back and relax, it can entertain you.It's true there's no surprise in the plot...but there's no plot surprise in 99,9% of mainstream movies. But there's a decent story that been told many times before this, and will be told many times after. Some better, some worse.What it does have though is Chastain, Farrell and Malkovich. The rest might not have depth, but they don't have to. Because those three have and they work great with, and against, each other.Besides, it's about time wee see more women leads in these types of movies. It's good for the genre.",Ava

Our favorite was ""stop what are you doing don't do that"" when Ava puts her hand on Michael's shoulder. Every cliche possible was said. Half of the dialogue didn't even make sense.Whoever did stunts for this film is a moron. It was sooo obviously fake and the camera angles made it worse. There were also multiple scenes that scarily reminded me of John Wick (ie club scene, hotel...).John Milkovitch's worst performance, period.The plot was all over the place and there were so many ""twists"" it made it even more laughable. (Ava's ex boyfriend Michael getting engaged to her sister after Ava went awol, then cheating on her with Ava when she got back, then telling her that her sister is pregnant right after???

There's nothing particularly groundbreaking in the story or action scenes. However, I think the acting is pretty good* and there is effort put in by everyone. In essence, this a typical ""assassin wants to get out of the business"" movie. Personally, I don't know if this is Chastain's type of genre, but she manages to edge by as a killer; just.Overall, worth a watch and move on with your life.* the ""actor"" playing Michael is pretty bad. I'm sorry, but his line readings are so stilted and there is no weight behind anything he says. The actor and the character were some of the weakest parts in the whole thing.",Ava
738,recinosalexis,An Action & Thriller Movie,8,31 August 2021,"I'm a big fan of movies, especially action movies because I find them very interesting, and this one was no exception! Ava is an action movie produced by Netflix. The series is about an assassin working for a black ops organization, after a dangerous mission goes wrong Ava is forced to fight for her own life.This movie makes you feel different emotions throughout its development. Every scene is full of suspense because many want to kill Ava but she is smarter. It is a very well-produced movie, the visual and audio effects are great. I have a lot of favorite parts and I think it's all the scenes where Ava fights because it's amazing and you will be amazed. Many people have said that it is a peculiar but very entertaining movie because of the plot full of surprises and suspense it has.Although the movie is very cool because of the plot and the different scenarios it has something that really catches my attention are the fight scenes as they look a little unreal, I mean how can they survive so much, it doesn't have much logic but come on we know how these movies are. Another thing is the ending, I liked it but I think they should have kept a definitive ending and not leave it open, however, it's up to you to imagine how it ends.That's why I give the movie a package eight stars out of a possible ten. I have to say that it is a movie that I really recommend! If you are one of those people who like action and suspense this is the perfect movie for you. You won't be disappointed!",Ava
739,prodigy1978,Skip It!!,2,11 February 2021,"With a strong cast this should shape up to be a really good 'assassin becomes the target' type film. Unfortunately it's a pretty weak affair. Apart from a reasonable acting job from Colin Farrell the rest of the cast offer a hammy performance. The fight scenes look like they're still learning the choreography but ran out of time to rehearse.
The plot is not only predictable but is also littered with holes. You're often left wondering why certain things are happening. It feels like important details/information are on the cutting room floor.
It's only afterwards when I read about the production problems and reshoots that it makes sense why the film feels disjointed.
Bottom line... skip it.",Ava
740,ben3654,It's... really bad.,1,25 August 2020,"You have to spend good money on every part of the production and it's almost as if all money went to the actors. The writers were bad, they couldn't afford more of Jessica's double, consultants and coaches for fight scenes clearly got no budget or they were off the clearance rack, the family part was a huge distraction, why Common for that role? Btw, that casting director should never work again. There was no reason for Common. That was a waste of budget. You had two interracial situations for zero reason. All it did was cause distraction. There was also noooo reason for Colin Farrell. He talked a big game, only to be kicked in the knee and shot in the head... and they're assassins? Omg. This movie couldn't get worse. I watched the whole thing to prove that to myself. The whole movie could be summed up by looking at ""Ava's"" hair... vapid and cheap. I'm not mad that you wasted money on that movie... I'm mad that I stood up past my bedtime to watch it and it was horrendous. There were levels to the story that was so unfitting, distracting and ill planned. The director needs to never work again. They allows that lack of quality to happen? Ugh. I can't.",Ava

Luckily its not too long that is probably the only thing going for it. Besides Malkovich and Chastain the acting is really BAD especially Common he is just terrible. NO idea why he is there he just does not fit and it a bad actor.

748,Martin-cox-128-979916,My first ever review,1,3 December 2020,"This movie was so awful it inspired me to break a habit of a lifetime and write a review. It is my penance for failing to read the reviews of others, which would have warned me.There isn't really a plot, but what little plot there is is (a) mind-numbingly boring and (b) makes no sense.The acting is poor, but probably mostly because the script is so dire. The big name actors were doing their best, I'm sure, but the lines they had to deliver made it impossible to portray characters we could believe, much less identify with. Nothing about any of the characters made us care about them.The gratuitous violence, which served no plot purpose, and for which no reasons were offered, was therefore like unskillful dancing: lots of activity but no reason for anyone but the participants to bother paying attention.Really. Save your time. Watch something else. Or read a book. Don't watch this.P.S. I have to tick a box answering if my review contains spoilers. It couldn't. Nothing of the slightest interest actually happens in this movie.",Ava

750,NDarcy,Painful to watch Chastain in such a movie,4,19 September 2020,"A somewhat predictable plot, but this is an action movie so I wasn't expecting much in that department. The only redeeming feature in the movie is Jessica Chastain, hence why I don't give it one star. Common is absolutely terrible, as in every single movie I see him in; no idea who keeps thinking he can act - a wooden plank would probably do a better job. And the story line for his character is boring and completely expendable.

I'm normally not very critical of movies and take them as they are but this is just plain awful.Let's start out with the storyline... there isn't one. From beginning to end it's just non stop killing and fight scenes for no reason. I don't know why they put a hit out on Ava (Jessica) and then sent only one guy to do the job and he wasn't even good at it. I don't know why half of the people got killed in the first place.Her drinking problem had nothing to do with the story but they focused on that pretty heavily, which made no sense and the whole family thing was just really boring and had no plot either. Also, the ending made absolutely no sense, I won't spoil it for anyone who still decides to watch it but it was just plain stupid how that went down.Overall, I gave it two stars because Jessica was a pretty good actress but I have no idea why she would even want to be in this movie, I know I'd be ashamed.

Geena Davis, who has fought for women in Hollywood, has to utter a sentence 'I chose your father over you because I was afraid of being alone'. Jessica Chastain played a scene where she threw herself at her sister's fiancé and asked him to run away with her. Diana Silvers has maybe 5 sentences in the whole flick.
