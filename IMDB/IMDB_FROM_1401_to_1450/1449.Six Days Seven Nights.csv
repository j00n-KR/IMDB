0,Leofwine_draca,A souring experience,2,14 September 2021,The film that soured me to Anne Heche and it's no surprise that her career tanked afterwards. Harrison Ford is way too old for the role and the best thing is the Danny Trejo cameo. The scenario reeks of cliche and the humour just isn't funny.,Six Days Seven Nights
1,SnoopyStyle,Ford not the rom-com type,4,12 August 2015,"Robin Monroe (Anne Heche) is an assistant editor of a fashion magazine in NYC. She goes on a tropical vacation with boyfriend Frank Martin (David Schwimmer). After accepting Frank's proposal, Robin has a quick job to supervise a photo shoot. She hops on Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford)'s plane to make the short trip but a storm forces them to crash.I've never bought Harrison Ford as a rom-com lead and this is a prime example. Although he has more chemistry with Anne Heche than David Schwimmer has with her. This is pretty standard rom-com fare. If it had better actors for this type of movie, I think this could have worked. Anne Heche also has a bit of problem with light rom-coms. There is a specific type that these two actors don't necessarily fit.Then there is the switch in tone midway through. If that's the tone, then the first half is ill-fitting. I hate that the movie keeps going back to Schwimmer. His character really doesn't work for many reasons. This movie struggles to find the right tone.",Six Days Seven Nights
2,claudio_carvalho,Lost in Paradise,7,15 October 2021,"In New York, the assistant magazine editor Robin Monroe (Anne Heche) has dinner with her boyfriend Frank Martin (David Schwimmer) that invites her to spend six days and seven nights in the paradisiacal island Makatea. When they arrive in Tahiti, they take the charter owned by the rough middle-aged pilot Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford) and assisted by his friend, the hot Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors). On the arrival in Makatea, Frank proposes Robin and gives a ring to her. However, her editor Marjorie (Allison Janney) asks Robin to fly to Tahiti to cover a story and she hires Quinn, who has the only available plane, to travel during the night. Out of the blue, the weather changes and they crash on an uninhabited island. Now they have to support each other to survive and wait for the improbable rescue.""Six Days Seven Nights"" is a funny and romantic adventure from the 90's with Harrison Ford performing the free-spirited pilot Quinny and the gorgeous and expressive Anne Heche performing the independent New York woman Robin in the lead roles. The locations are amazingly beautiful and Quinny and Robin seem to be lost in paradise. The delightful romance is highly recommended for fans of the genre. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Seis Dias, Sete Noites"" (""Six Days Seven Nights"")",Six Days Seven Nights
3,lee_eisenberg,"If the people behind this movie believed that it equalled the original ""Swept Away"", they must be stupider than we realize.",3,13 July 2006,"In one of Harrison Ford's real low points, he plays a gruff pilot who gets stranded on an uncharted island with stuffy reporter Anne Heche. While Lina Wertmuller's ""Swept Away"" did a really good job with this sort of situation (and ""Gilligan's Island"" made it really funny), ""Six Days Seven Nights"" totally bungles it. It's got to be one of the most predictable movies ever.Overall, the movie brings up two questions: why can't Harrison Ford just stick with what he's good at, and why was Anne Heche getting so many roles in the late '90s? I assume that Ford probably wants to downplay his role in this movie (although his recent roles haven't been much better: ""K-19"", ""Hollywood Homicide"" and ""Firewall""). Ditto Heche. Also starring - and embarrassing themselves - are David Schwimmer, Allison Janney, Cliff Curtis and Danny Trejo. And above all, it showed that director Ivan Reitman was truly declining, to the point that he most recently backed Arnold Schwarzenegger for California governor.All in all, avoid this one.",Six Days Seven Nights
4,jboothmillard,Six Days Seven Nights,6,27 May 2008,"From director Ivan Reitman (Twins, Evolution) this is quite a good desert island that could have been slightly better and funnier, but worth watching none the less. Basically Robin Monroe (Anne Heche) and her long time boyfriend Frank Martin (David Schwimmer) take a vacation to the tropical paradise of Makatea in the South Pacific. They arrive and are taken to their hotel by plane by middle-aged American pilot Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford), and the vacation seems to be going well, for one day anyway. Robin can't escape her work when she is needed urgently, so she pays Quinn to take her to Tahiti, but a storm stops them, and they are struck, crash landing on a deserted island. They are now fighting for their survival, constantly bickering, and eventually slowly falling for each other. Frank meanwhile is trying to get people to search for them, while at the same time being tempted by the seduction of Quinn's ""friend"" Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors). Quinn and Robin have become more close to each other, and pirates threaten them, so they have to work fast to try and get the plane to fly again. In the end, injured Quinn and Robin get back to Makatea after defeating the pirates, and Robin and Frank admit their feeling for other people, and break up, and Robin and Quinn get their ""happy ending"".

I don't know if I'd own it, but it's worth watching once or twice.THE GOOD - Some tremendous South Seas island scenery; a good mix of comedy and adventure with attractive leads in Anne Heshe and Harrison Ford; and fast-moving story meaning good entertainment.THE BAD - Poor messages about fidelity and marriages; an annoying, whining character played by David Schwimmer; too heavy - for family viewing - on the profanity and cleavage.",Six Days Seven Nights
6,rmax304823,Good Thing It Wasn't Longer.,4,25 November 2015,"Ivan Reitman, the director, is usually able to pep things up but you can't breathe life into a corpse.It wasn't possible to watch this thing all the way through but it wasn't necessary either because it's all so familiar from previous versions of the bourgeois lady stranded with the handsome roughneck on the island of Sarcastica. Or is it Moribunda? The formula was an enormous success with ""It Happened One Night"" in 1934, a commercial and critical success, and a lot of fun. There were imitations of course but the pattern seemed exhausted by 1941's ""The Bride Came C.O.D.,"" which had Bette Davis sitting on a cactus. But periodically since then the coffin creaks open and another attempt to use a tried and true formula emerges. Well, what the hell. All the originals were in black and white, and nobody watches old movies anymore.I really don't mind an occasional visit to the graveyard if the zombies turn out to be entertaining, but this is not. The anger and snottiness turn to love, sure, but it's not very funny. The jokes are the kind you might find in Laurel and Hardy. The dialog is bromidic. The performances are over pitched as if in an attempt to compensate for the uninspired plot.The writers haven't bothered with credibility much, but that's okay because this is supposed to be a romantic fantasy. Still, it's momentarily painful when you realize that they didn't care whether the setting was supposed to be Polynesia or the Caribbean. Everyone speaks English, some with a French accent, others with a Spanish accent. It doesn't matter to the writers, for whom a foreign accent is a foreign accent, just like the 1940s when the heroes spoke American and the Nazis spoke British.You have to be undemanding to enjoy this but the kids should get a kick out of it.",Six Days Seven Nights
7,dbdumonteil,holidays in the sun...,5,8 May 2003,"Do you know Francis Veber? He's one of the most popular French film-maker. He owes his success thanks to a comic method which he knows the secret. It's the confrontation of two people who have got a different disposition but are compelled to cohabit together in an unfriendly environment. This situation is told in a comedy tone By telling Harrison Ford and Anne Heche's adventures, Ivan Reitman must have been influenced by Francis Veber' method. Here, a confident and bold Harrison Ford mixes with a coward Anne Heche. After a dragging beginning, the movie becomes lively and rhythmic when our two heroes are stranded on the island. It contains good and funny moments, especially when the characters are having an argument. But, it follows a predictable advance: at first, Ford and Heche can't stand each other but little by little, they learn to know each other better. It's all the more as they'll have to go through a hard time so as to leave the island. Finally, it's love that will shine them.At the end, you get a nice but colorless comedy. Nevertheless, Reitman can sustain the interest during all the movie and skilfully avoids boredom.",Six Days Seven Nights
8,blanche-2,fails the litmus test,6,7 February 2001,"The litmus test is -- if [big star] weren't in this film, could it be a TV movie?  Alas, the answer is yes.  Though very entertaining with good performances, how Six Days Seven Nights made it to the big screen eludes me. It is not original and doesn't have the kind of script one demands of a feature film.  I was just glad I didn't pay $8.50 or more to see it in the theater - but it will do well in video, where it should have gone directly in the first place.",Six Days Seven Nights
9,Quinoa1984,Good if not great romance/comedy,6,3 January 2001,"Ivan Reitman's Six Days, Seven Nights has Anne Heche as a career woman who goes ion a tropical vacation with her boyfriend, but then a problem sidetracks her to go to another island.  But then the plane crashes she's on and her pilot (Harrison Ford) and her are stuck on the island with distaste towards each other.  Ford gets a pretty good change of pace here by going to the comedy timing and there is good comic direction by veteran Reitman, but Heche brings the film down with her annoying performance.  Still, it's watchable.  B",Six Days Seven Nights

11,hitchcockthelegend,"I decided my life is too simple, I wanna complicate the hell out of it.",4,30 December 2009,"You know, this really should have been gold. A great and trusty premise of male and female polar opposites stranded on a desert island-plenty of star wattage with the leads (Harrison Ford & Anne Heche)-and a stunning Hawaii location. Yeah, it should have been aces, however, it's not. What it is is a practically laugh-free script driven movie further bogged down by a lack of chemistry from the leads and unadventurous direction from Ivan Reitman. Unadventerous is of course not a word one expects to see bandied around for a romantic action comedy film. But Reitman is unable to rise above predictable scene after predictable scene, and more criminal is the complete waste of his two leads, with Ford amazingly underwritten in a practically two person picture!It starts off OK, nicely paced and characters are given some ground from which to launch from, with even David Schwimmer doing an extension of his Ross from Friends act not hindering proceedings. But once Ford and Heche crash on the island the film begs to be kicked on. Instead it gets mired in a one joke premise as our two stranded protagonists traverse the island and annoy the hell out of each other. Even the sudden appearance of pirates lacks zip and in fact feels rather shoehorned in. And with each frame the outcome of the piece is telegraphed and written in the sand for us, but really, will you care come the inevitable finale? Not likely. For although Ford entertains well enough with his grizzly character, and Heche is sexy and gorgeous, we just haven't been engaged enough in the set-up to summon up much feeling as the credits thankfully roll. 4/10",Six Days Seven Nights
12,Scarecrow-88,Six Days Seven Nights,6,17 January 2016,"Summer movie fluff has spunky and sexy New York pop culture magazine editor Anne Heche flying off with beau David Schwimmer to a resort island for a little week vacation. The pilot is played by Harrison Ford, a handsome yet aging bachelor whose closest relationship is with a stunning island sexpot known for her stage performances which wow the male tourists happening to guzzle cocktails at the hut bars. Because he is defiantly ""set in his ways"" (he voices his opinion even if it isn't exactly popular, can be a bit rough around the edges in the conversation department in his lack of mincing words, and has the tendency to offer less-than-polite remarks when antagonized) and argumentative when it comes to someone challenging his sense of liberated ""relationship purgatory"" (he's alone, isn't tied to someone who could throw a monkey wrench in his freedom to go wherever he wants and do whatever he wants), Ford and Heche have a bit of friction (his type doesn't often find his way into the orbit of her NYC social class). So Heche is soaking up the sun, drinking some fruity alcoholic drinks, and enjoying her time with Schwimmer (even agreeing to marry him after his proposal) at the resort, her magazine calls, requesting her to fly to Tahiti for a particular article, certain to make the lead of the week. So she offers $700 bucks to Ford if he will fly her to Tahiti, and he reluctantly agrees. When they encounter a major storm, a bolt of lightning strikes the plane, and Ford must land it on a deserted South Pacific island. Once there, Ford and Heche must find a beacon in the hopes of summoning a rescue crew, but they soon encounter pirates who kill the owner of a yacht and take his possessions! Stranded on lush, tropical environs, the two stars bicker a bit (it is all playful banter), try to avoid clear and present danger (totally intentional tie of Harrison to that movie), and find a means to get off the island. They fall in love, comment on each other's looks, try to keep from freaking out when troubles arise, and go into MacGuyver mode building a plan from old WWII plane parts found within the island. I have to say that Heche looks fantastic and Ford by 1998 had kept himself in impressively athletic shape. Ford has a natural movie star charisma a film so undemanding as this can depend upon. I enjoyed seeing him so relaxed and free of the usual intensity; sometimes an actor of his stature can get away with a film like this which just plucks from other better survival island movies. Heche seems perfectly comfortable in a film like this as the lead (she would rarely get another chance to be featured in such a Hollywood high profile fluff piece as this), and her skimpy bikini outfits certainly convey how much effort she put into getting into shape. Turn your brain off junk food this movie is.Schwimmer is a lot of fun as Heche's fiancé, conflicted about the island hottie who offers her body to him while he's concerned about his missing girlfriend's welfare. His nervy energy is amusing. The pirates subplot is a bit tacked on and truthfully unneeded...it seems like this was applied to provide a little peril for the leads. I felt that those who wrote the film were in dire need of padding to accompany Ford and Heche's arguing and eventual romance.",Six Days Seven Nights
13,anaconda-40658,One Day to Trash It.,2,30 June 2015,"Six Days, Seven Nights (1998): Dir: Ivan Reitman / Cast: Harrison Ford, Anne Heche, David Schwimmer, Jacqueline Obradors, Temuera Morrison: An action centred Swiss Family Robinson catering to romantic thrills and dumb subplots. A long stretch of time between two people whose initial personalities are in conflict while their inner emotions are in total denial. Harrison Ford plays a pilot who spirits David Schwimmer and Anne Heche off to the tropical. In order to match Ford and Heche together the screenwriter concocts a sudden business trip where he must pilot her away but the plane goes down in the heat of a storm. They crash land on an island and bicker back and forth and are chased by pirates. Lame plot doubles back and forth between Ford and Heche and the lame guilt ridden affair David Schwimmer indulges in that nobody cares about. Director Ivan Reitman doesn't clash romance, humour and adventure very successfully, and that is unfortunate since he has directed such superior films as Ghostbusters and Stripes. Ford and Heche are able actors stranded within lame situations that are beneath them. Schwimmer is horrible as the guilt ridden beau who needs another drink after being associated with this junk. Supporting actors fares little better and more or less await for anything to happen. Beautiful photography within a lackluster screenplay that crash lands. Score: 2 / 10",Six Days Seven Nights
14,AaronCapenBanner,Stranded With Robin,5,9 December 2013,"Ivan Reitman directed this romantic comedy-adventure that stars Harrison Ford as Quinn Harris, a boozing and grumpy pilot hired by beautiful New York executive Robin Monroe(played by Anne Heche) to fly her to Tahiti for business reasons, but unfortunately are forced down on a seemingly deserted island by a storm. While trying to repair the plane, and gather supplies to survive their stay, they find themselves(you guessed it!) falling for each other, even as an unexpected danger arises... Well cast at least, with two most appealing performances by Ford & Heche, and the location is also quite beautiful, and while it is certainly innocuous, it is also utterly predictable, though it's about as amiable as can be under the circumstances. Not bad for what it is.",Six Days Seven Nights
15,Wuchakk,Harrison Ford and Anne Heche as castaways on a paradisal island,7,5 June 2016,"A small-plane pilot (Harrison Ford) is stranded on a remote Pacific island with a New York magazine editor (Anne Heche). Not only do they have to survive and find a way back to civilization, but they encounter other mortal dangers. David Schwimmer plays the woman's fiancé while Jacqueline Obradors is on hand as the dalliance of the pilot.""Six Days Seven Nights"" (1998) is a lost-on-a-deserted-island adventure/romance sometimes compared to ""The African Queen"" (1951) for obvious reasons, but ""Six Days"" seems more farcical. There's also a little ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (1965) added to the mix.Harrison is charismatic as the stalwart, but slightly alcoholic loner/pilot while Heche is intelligent and likable. Unfortunately, some of their bickering comes across forced in an eye-rolling way, but the movie makes up for it with a surprisingly potent dramatic scene near the end. Beyond that, the movie is quick-paced comic book fluff that never gets boring, but also never goes deep or realistic enough for my tastes. Nevertheless, I'm a sucker for stranded-on-deserted-island flicks.The contrast between Heche and Obradors' characters is interesting: Robin (Heche) is attractive in an intelligent plain-Jane kind of way while Angelica (Obradors) is alluring in a bodacious cutie manner. The fact that the latter is air-headed and morally dubious removes her from the realm of possibilities, as far as a lifelong soulmate goes. She's babelicious, though, and the movie tastefully shows it.The film is short and sweet at 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot at Kaua'i, Hawaii. The locations are spectacular.GRADE: B.",Six Days Seven Nights
16,SimonJack,"Like Ford's plane, this film won't fly",4,18 July 2018,"The only thing that this film has going for it is the scenery. The idea for the plot of ""Six Days Seven Nights"" was a good one, if not original, about people being stranded on an island. Unfortunately, the screenplay goes way overboard in the action area with its wild encounters. With a weak script and weak characters, the actors can't save this film. Harrison Ford and Anne Heche seem to reflect the lack of anything of substance in the film, let alone any chemistry for romance. Other things detract from the film - its crude language, pushing of sex, and violence. With all that Quinn Harris (Ford) and Robin Monroe (Heche) face in this film, couldn't the writers and director have squeezed in a couple more oddities? Say, an erupting volcano, or a giant gorilla attack? As others have noted, Harrison Ford, like most actors, had poor roles in films that were turkeys. This is probably one film he'd like to forget.",Six Days Seven Nights
17,siderite,"It's not bad, but so predictable it's boring",7,21 June 2006,"It's an average romantic comedy, augmented by Ford, destroyed by Heche and made silly by Schwimmer. I guess at his 50+ (as he himself confesses in the movie) Harrison Ford's character couldn't afford to be picky, but still. Why does ""annoying blonde with no tits"" mean romance in the US?Anyway, there isn't much to be said. Exotic scenery plus a bit of danger and a ""suave"" Ford makes any girl lose her mind, heart and panties. The plot is ridiculous and the directing itself, except for the island scenes, seems to be completely uninterested in the result.If they would have made sex all movie, without any real plot, it would have been called a porn film and it's bad (worse than even violent movies about murders and such), but if they fall in love the whole movie, within the same lack of story, it is called a romance and it's OK. I will just call it a romantic crap and be done with it.Conclusion: even my wife got bored.",Six Days Seven Nights

19,JamesHitchcock,Lacks the Wit and the Psychological Insight that Mark the Best Romantic Comedies,6,21 June 2006,"Robin Munro, an employee of a New York-based fashion magazine, is enjoying a short holiday on a remote South Sea island when she receives a telephone call from her editor, asking her to go to Tahiti for an urgent assignment. The only way to get there is by a small single-engined plane, and halfway through the trip the pilot is forced by bad weather to make an emergency landing on a small uninhabited island. The plane's landing gear is damaged, meaning that they are unable to take off again, and the radio equipment was put out of action by the storm, making their chances of rescue unlikely. Fortunately, however, Robin and the pilot, Quinn Harris, find themselves falling in love.This being a romantic comedy, there have to be some obstacles to their love. Robin and Quinn are complete opposites, he being a tough man of action and a lover of the great outdoors, whereas she is a suave, metropolitan New Yorker. Initially, they take a dislike to each other. Most importantly, Robin has a fiancé, Frank- indeed, they have come on holiday together to celebrate their engagement. Quinn also has a mistress, a local girl named Angelica, although this relationship does not seem to involve a great deal of emotional commitment, at least not on his part.In real life, matters like this might prove insuperable obstacles. In a rom-com, however, they are less obstacles than standard plot clichés. (See, for example, ""You've Got Mail"", in which the same three obstacles were overcome equally easily). The three basic rules of love and marriage in rom-coms can be summarised as i) opposites attract, ii) lovers always start off by hating one another, iii) the big-name star always gets the girl, so you needn't worry about other boyfriends on the horizon.Harrison Ford is normally associated either with action adventures, like the ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" series, or political or legal thrillers such as ""Patriot Games"" or ""The Fugitive"". He is not, therefore, perhaps the first actor one would think of when casting the hero of a romantic comedy. He was, however, surprisingly good in ""Working Girl"" (even if ""Sabrina"" was something of a disappointment) and here, as Quinn, he is able to draw upon his normal gruff and laconic but steady and dependable screen persona in order to emphasise the contrast with the more voluble and emotional Robin. It is clear that he is, underneath his tough exterior, a man of strong emotions, even if he has difficulty in expressing them- he left America to live in the islands after a painful divorce when his wife left him for his best friend. There are, in fact, brief attempts to turn this into an adventure film, when Quinn and Robin have to battle a gang of pirates, although even these turn into comedy when the pirates manage to sink their own ship, making them seem more like inept buffoons than ruthless cutthroats.Anne Heche presumably took this role to bolster her image as Hollywood's first born-again heterosexual, although her Robin struck me as being a bit too abrasive- not the girl I would choose to be marooned on a desert island with. Her treatment of the hapless Frank, whom David Schwimmer played as goofy but likable, also struck me as rather heartless. (I can foresee that Schwimmer is going to have a real problem with typecasting- every character he plays reminds me of his Ross from ""Friends""). The scriptwriters seem to have shared my view about Robin's heartlessness, as they included a rather improbable scene where Frank beds Angelica while both are fretting over their missing partners. The idea was presumably to undermine the audience's sympathy for Frank by insisting that he is as guilty of infidelity as Robin is. We never actually find out how Frank's romance with Angelica progresses, but as she is a very underdeveloped character, we never really care.The film that I was most reminded of was that great eighties rom-com ""Crocodile Dundee"", which also featured a young female New York journalist who falls to an exotic location where she falls for an older man of action. ""Crocodile Dundee"", however, is a far better film, treating this theme with a great deal more style and humour. Harrison's Quinn is not in the same league as Paul Hogan's Mick Dundee, one of the great comic characters of all time. ""Six Days, Seven Nights"" makes for enjoyable if undemanding watching, but it lacks both the wit and the psychological insight that mark the best romantic comedies. 6/10",Six Days Seven Nights
20,CuriosityKilledShawn,A lame movie that can't decide what it wants to be,5,4 August 2000,"Six Days Seven Nights goes through all of the usual cardboard characters and clichés you would expect. It might not be so bad if the film wasn't so 90s. The dated presentation and production design really is quite distracting in the present day.Anne Heche and the wooden David Schwimmer play a couple in love who take a quick vacation to the South Pacific. Harrison Ford plays the grouchy pilot who flies them to their island resort. But a mishap leads to a plane crash leaving Ford and Heche stranded while Schwimmer has to mourn his lost love, leading to the not-so-shocking revelation that he the experience has revealed no character to him whatsoever. A fact that the writer tries to cover-up by not-so-cleverly working it into the dialogue.The dialogue and humor is cheap, simple, and easy. The music generic and dated. All this film really has going for it is some pretty scenery. They try to liven things up by introducing pirates 30 minutes from the end, but they seem unnaturally shoehorned in. None of them are given names, have barely 5 minutes screen time, and hardly any dialogue.The trailers promised an old-fashioned island adventure movie. What they actually gave us was more of a romantic comedy. There were action scenes featured in the trailer that are not in the movie. The running time of 101 minutes and the very abrupt resolution gives the impression that there was more action and plot before someone ordered it to be cut out.What's left is just an okay movie. It is neither original nor clever and has no spark, no edge, and no bite. David Schwimmer once more proves he can only do one character (Ross Geller) and can't even do it very well.Six Days, Seven Nights is hardly groundbreaking but is an enjoyable time-waster.

Sure it may get a bit silly in the 2nd half, but it's still quite fun, and it's quite underrated as well!, plus i found the ending to be really cool!. Thankfully David Schwimmer, is at least bearable, and it has some cool action scenes as well!, plus it's quite creative at times as well!. The scenery is really beautiful, and the finale is quite exciting!, however the villains(Pirates), had barely anything to do, and therefore, didn't find them menacing, it's basically a Romance Comedy, but it's quite a good one at that!. This wasn't too popular with critics, however i really enjoyed it, it had likable characters and 2 very charismatic leads with Ford and Heche, and there chemistry is what really makes it work, i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great. Ivan Reitman does a great job here, with awesome camera work, great angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is wonderful!. Harrison Ford is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, hilarious, had fantastic chemistry with Anne Heche, was extremely charismatic, had some great lines, and didn't take it seriously, and had fun with it! (Ford Rules!!!!!!!). Anne Heche is beautiful, and is fantastic here, she is very charming, likable, seemed comfortable with Ford, had a cool character, and seemed to be enjoying herself!, i loved her (heche rules). David Schwimmer is thankfully bearable, but still managed to annoy me, and basically played his Friends character, he didn't impress me. Jacqueline Obradors is hot, and did okay, in he role but wasn't required to do much but act sexy, she did a good job at that though. Rest of the cast do fine.

Almost all renowned actors have participated in at least one, and almost never go well or are successful. In this case we have Harrison Ford in the lead role, but he is undoubtedly in a role that seems to make him uncomfortable.The script is simple: a loving couple from New York decide to have a romantic vacation on a paradise island of Polynesia. But she works as a photographer for a women's magazine, and at some point is urgently required to do work on a nearby island, Tahiti. The plane crashes and she, and the pilot she doesn't get along with, end up trapped on a deserted island, leaving their respective boyfriends alone on the resort. Add some danger, some adventure, seduction and you're done. Simple and relatively effective.Harrison Ford is not very good at the role given to him. It's never funny and it's grosser than seductive. Either way, she performed fairly well, managing to collaborate well with Anne Heche, whom the script reserves the best comedy scenes and the funniest parts of the dialogue (especially when her character drinks or gets hysterical). David Schwimmer, unfortunately, can never be good. His character is just a good-hearted idiot with more money than intelligence. Jacqueline Obradors, meanwhile, had little to do. Her character is hot, pretty and dumb, and appearing almost naked and talking in a funny way is enough. In fact, despite being a romantic comedy, the movie bets too much on infidelity and vulgarizes treason.The best of this movie, no doubt, is the photography and the scenery, which masterfully took advantage of the light, color and magnificent landscapes of the Pacific islands. This makes the movie beautiful and pleasing to the eye. The humorous and adventurous scenes and the light tone and fast pace with which the story takes place also greatly help to make the movie enjoyable. But it's not a good movie for the family: it has seductive scenes and messages that are inappropriate for the family.",Six Days Seven Nights
25,leplatypus,All in 1 (tv),10,10 July 2017,"I don't know why this movie is rated so low because it's a good comedy in which Harrison plays all his iconic parts : the tongue in cheek pilot – Han Solo, the romantic lover – Sabrina, the brave and stoic explorer – Indiana Jones so for all Harrison's fans like me, it's a pleasure In addition, he has an excellent flair with his choice of Anne Heche as his partner because she is the only one in the list to be able to play the necessary little mouse opposite to his big bear grumpy attitude. The locations are really wonderful and heavenly and the other smaller parts are well played and enjoyable. Maybe the only disappointment is the movie is the backstory of Heche's boyfriend and split : as usual (see Tumbledown for another example), the pretext is quick and dirty As it's a comedy, it would have been more fun if Harrison and Heche would fall in love while cast away and Schwimmer and the dancer would fall in love believing they are dead. So when they all reunite, they have already switched lovers but every body being happy !!",Six Days Seven Nights

27,gwnightscream,"""Good Romance Comedy!""",6,11 May 2014,"Harrison Ford, Anne Heche, David Schwimmer, Jacqueline Obradors and Temeura Morrison star in Ivan Reitman's 1998 romance comedy. Heche plays Robin, a New York magazine editor who goes on vacation to Tahiti with her fiancée, Frank (Schwimmer). After their arrival, Robin is called in to work for a very important business deal. She tries to take a quick flight with help from cargo pilot, Quinn (Ford). They travel during a storm and crash on a remote island somewhere outside Tahiti. Soon, they find themselves on an adventure and fall for each other while trying to get back. Obradors plays Quinn's assistant, Angelica and Morrison (Star Wars Prequels) plays Jager, a pirate.

28,FiendishDramaturgy,"Ford Was Competent, But This Rom/Com Can't Float.",5,8 April 2007,"Anne Heche had just ""come out"" into the public eye with her relationship with Ellen DeGeneres, so it was a hard sell to convince movie goers of her on-screen relationship with Ford's character. I think that element and the heavy-handed direction of this film are the principal reasons for its failure to wow audiences at the box offices.Beyond that, Ford was more believable herein than in Hollywood Homicide, and delivered a class action performance. Audiences believed him as the hero. What they couldn't believe was Heche in a heterosexual role, at that time, regardless of her later choice of a male mate. She was much more believable in Volcano. This was mildly entertaining, but just didn't float.It earns a 5.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Six Days Seven Nights

They charter a plane piloted by Harrison Ford. That was the beginning of trouble for all three of them.The attraction of the movie is the beautiful scenery of Tahiti where this movie was shot. Cinematography is one of the most gorgeous I've seen. The movie makes you feel that you're vacationing at the islands. Harrison Ford put in the comedic side of the story as only he could. Yuppies of the '90s and the rich set culture is so obvious in this movie. How society slid down hill since then in such a short time is just amazing.The movie has irony, comedy, and lot of beautiful scenery, and is worth while watching especially for the beautiful scenery of the Society Islands (Ending shots taken at Kauai).",Six Days Seven Nights
30,PWNYCNY,Surprisnlgy good movie.,8,5 October 2008,"The movie has all the trappings of mediocrity but is surprisingly a good movie. In terms of quality, this movie is on the same level as Joe vs. The Vulcano. The main reason why this movie is watchable is the performance of Harrison Ford. He proves once again what a great actor he is. Even in relative lightweight fare he is a dominating presence on the screen. David Schwimmer and Ann Heche also provide excellent performances. There is a part of the movie where it could have become another Swept Away but thankfully the story takes a more original turn. One remake of Swept Away was enough. The movie contains nice scenery but underscores that looks can be deceiving and that what looks like a paradise can also be a prison from which there is no escape.",Six Days Seven Nights

A must see!!,10,26 August 2020,"Have no idea how anyone can rate this below a 8 it's a comedy gem, Harrison Ford is a underrated comedy actor he brings a dry laid back style that works great. Hes the reason for star wars success his acting in those movies made it believable and took away the horrible casting of mark Hamill. Anyway Anne heche was seen in public with ellen DeGeneres as her girlfriend when this came out ( as she did as well) and it hurt the movie big time, even though she is also great in this movie. The casting was spot on, story was predictable but it works, some scenes are forever emblazoned in my mind. It has a 5.8 as I write this extremely to low!!!!

32,hu675,An entertaining romantic comedy with touches of an adventure movie.,8,8 April 2007,"When a hard-working career woman by the name of Robin Monroe (Anne Heche) works for a popular woman magazine. When her nice boyfriend Frank Martin (David Schwimmer) purposed to her to married him. Also to come with him for a week at a tropical island. Once they get there... they meet a gruff, rough cargo pilot Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford). Once the pilot brings them to the island, Robin and Frank start enjoying their vacation. But the trouble starts when her boss (Allison Janney) calls her from their trip to take a photo shoot. Robin asks Quinn to bring her to the location, where she has to go. But once they left the ground to fly, they ended being hit by lighting and crashing to a deserted island and trying to find a way to get back to the tropical island. While Robin and Quinn dislike each other with plenty of problems and troubles. They find themselves chased by pirates (Temuera Morrison, Cliff Curtis and Danny Trejo). Slowly Robin and Quinn start falling for each other.Directed by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters 1 & 2, Junior, Twins) made this amusing, nicely filmed romantic/comedy/adventure with fun performances by Ford and Heche. This wasn't a huge hit at the box office but it should play well on video. Although involving pirate in the subplot seems out of place with the story. It's entertaining enough to overcome certain flaws in the movie. Probably the best thing of the picture is Ford, which he's especially loose and funny. Certainly worth viewing. Panavision.

34,gcd70,Departure for Reitman,6,19 April 2010,"A slight departure from director Ivan Reitman is this romance-adventure-comedy from the ""Romancing the Stone"" school.The story of two mismatched people stranded on an uncharted Pacific island is good fun, if very light. The humour is effective, and the predictable nature of the movie does not detract from its enjoyment. Anne Heche, who is a bit of a Hollywood darling at the moment, plays the damsel in distress, while Harrison Ford, a true Hollywood star (and talent), plays the broken down pilot who must figure out how to get the pair out of this mess.Saturday, May 15, 1999 - Video",Six Days Seven Nights
35,questl-18592,6D7N,6,23 September 2020,"I find myself torn after watching this one. The story is interesting enough, with a newly engaged couple going on a tropical vacation only for Heche's career to beckon and draw her away, leading her to Ford and the both of them to wind up stranded on an island.On the one hand, I actually think the performances of our main cast are all solid. Ancillary characters are all pretty flat but Ford, Heche, Schwimmer (even though he's still pretty heavily Ross) and Obradors are all compelling in their own way, but it's absolutely Ford and Heche's movie and it shows. Both characters felt compelling and well written, especially for the time.On the other hand, the plot felt forced so many times. Suddenly, pirates! Oh, and is he going to cheat, will he be true? Sure seems like he should go one way and doesn't. Oh and there has to be a forced, life altering romance, right? Who cares if the actors are near 30 years apart and it shows!In the end, I give a bit more credit to the acting and would say this is worth watching, just be prepared to roll your eyes at some of the contrivances. It wouldn't be my first choice to watch again, but it'sa solid enough movie and worth checking out if you can catch it streaming.",Six Days Seven Nights
36,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Funny but suffers from too many details,6,16 July 2014,"Filmgoers and critics alike are split on what to think on Ivan Reitman's films. Most would probably say that his earliest productions were the most original and fun. The best example being Ghost Busters (1984). But as time went on, Reitman started making some oddballs like Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990) and Junior (1994). Then he started reverting back to more realistic normal comedies. This particular film is in this group and has things going for it. The problem is that it gets too bogged down with other details that it forgets what its main purpose was in the first place. The plot focuses on a couple that heads out on vacation when one of them is called back. While returning the partner is stranded on an island with the pilot and must learn to survive together. The plot isn't all that special but the way it's executed is. Anne Heche and David Schwimmer play the couple on vacation as Robin and Frank. There they meet their pilots Quinn (Harrison Ford) and Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors). The two that become stranded on a remote island is Robin and Quinn. There they learn how to survive on their own. Yet, the casting of Schwimmer and Obradors wasn't necessary. It could've just been Robin going on vacation and being stranded with Quinn. It's not that Schwimmer or Obradors aren't funny or can't act, but their character arcs are predictable from the start and it doesn't end clearly either. If a couple is heading to vacation and the first thing your boyfriend does is stare at curvaceous women, I think viewers will have a clear idea where he's headed. It's not new material.First time writer Michael Browning did an OK job defining each character, but they are either clichéd or oddly paired. The other strange casting decision belongs to having Anne Hiche and Harrison Ford being together. Over time after learning how to get along, Robin and Quinn form a relationship. During this time, Ford wasn't the strapping youth he once was. Of course some people still find him attractive but most people's viewpoints would be that Ford is too old to be having any kind of a relationship with what looks to be a late 20s / early 30s woman. It's not uncommon (in real life), but for the movie's sake since age isn't the focus, it feels a bit weird. Also cast in the film is Temuera Morrison (known for Jango Fett), Cliff Curtis and Danny Trejo. They are hard to spot at times, but if you see them it's cool to see.The comedy also helps relieve audiences of the either familiar story line or characters. Either when it comes to Frank being goofy or Quinn reacting to Robin's actions, it is genuinely funny. Ford has the best quips. Some of it even reminisces to that of something Indiana Jones would say. Besides it's not all fun and games, Quinn and Robin even run into some modern day pirates. Yikes. The cinematography by Michael Chapman looks great. The view of the islands out to sea looks mesmerizing. Even Randy Edelman's score is nice. It has a theme to represent Quinn and Robin and it sounds memorable. The tune involves piano keys, which isn't the most frequent of an instrument included in a score. It works as a comedy but isn't anything new. The elements of comedy are funny and will have people laughing thanks to its cast. Yet, the casting on a direct basis is questionable and the writing is a bit formulaic.",Six Days Seven Nights
37,RNMorton,Okay by me,8,17 December 2003,"Ford and Heche are stranded on remote Pacific island and face various dangers while Schwimmer and Obradors party and fret.  Never entirely comfortable as either comedy or drama.  Beautiful scenery (including Obradors) compensates for awkwardness in many scenes between the leads.  A movie I never really thought I liked, it often finds its way onto my screen. 8/10 on scenery alone",Six Days Seven Nights
38,thekarmicnomad,Feels a lot longer than seven nights -and not in a good way,4,1 October 2013,"The premise for this movie is so old its worn down to the metal - that doesn't mean this film is automatically going to be bad.However it is.All the elements for success were there; great - well known actors, a beautiful setting and a wedge of money.Unfortunately there is zero chemistry between any of the main players, in fact they seemed positively awkward around each other. So when their relationships and lives slipped I was neither surprised nor interested.Although this is a rom-com I feel the actors didn't really put the effort in. It felt like they were only hanging around for their pay cheque.The camera work and production are very average not even taking advantage of the beautiful surroundings.You know what is going to happen ten minutes before the characters so you have to stifle yawns and nod politely as a story you have heard countless times before is retold - badly.",Six Days Seven Nights
39,Stampsfightclub,One of the most predictable adventures you will ever see,1,14 January 2009,"Robin (Heche) is called back to work from her vacation but she and pilot Quinn (Ford) have to land due to horrendous thunderstorms and land on a deserted island with no means to get back.Stuck on a deserted island, no food, and no means of survival and stuck with someone you can't stand. Six days and Seven Nights is described as an hilarious adventure but feels more like the holiday from hell with its predictable script, a choice of poor settings and one of the most awful and predictable romances to ever emerge on screen. From a man who has starred in the legendary Star Wars and Indian Jones quadrilogy, you would have expected Harrison Ford to be in more intelligent and sophisticated films than this, what can only be described, as a promising prospect gone completely wrong. Ford's talents are wasted against the tiresome script that gives no interest or excitement as it is based on a feeble against all odds morality test. Dull and with no sense of what to focus on, this 1998 picture is an abomination of an adventure. Cast Away, though emerging on screens a few years after this release, tells the story of a man lost with no means of getting home. Tom Hanks gave an Oscar nominated performance as the man desperate to survive and keep himself sane. Now that 2000 Zemeckis film was what the human spirit and survival should be like, a tear jerking journey that puts you inside the character's mind and makes you truly wonder.This plot doesn't know what to cover. The obvious mismatched couple crashing is as predictable as falling rain and the idea that they will hit it off is as clear as day. But trying to balance that against styling artistic setting and the concept of survival couldn't have been more inaccurate and distracting. First survival against the elements, then lust then exploration. And it seems the inaccurate concept of adventure needed an even dafter reason to entertain so some stereotypical pirates were encoded, just for extra eyebrow raising.There is not enough dialogue to justify the 'hilarious adventure' description. When trying to be funny, it's the typical pit pocking appearance regime or how funny it is to see how predictable the situations can be. Unsurprising, mismatched and so unadventurous you keep looking at your watch wondering when the inevitable will finally arrive.",Six Days Seven Nights

41,emm,An enjoyable movie getaway that becomes surprisingly violent.,6,7 February 1999,"One of the more entertaining comedy movies for the husband-and-wife crowd, SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS offers the peculiar feeling of a vacation getaway that runs amuck. Harrison Ford, a guy we know from many action thrillers this day, is far from being offbeat, and Anne Heche proves to be very reasonable. The adventure is otherwise an enjoyable amount of fun with perils and obstacles abound, all with a sense of humor. But the film loses a precious point for a surprisingly fair amount of violence that goes off the deep end when smugglers spot our two castaways and begin to attack using guns and explosives. Not true for a delightfully romantic evening in the living room. As comedies go, this one could use a bit more of the funny, however this cinematic getaway of mishaps is worth the pleasure. This would've deserved a ""7"" without the unnecesary violence, but you'll either have to take the ""6"", or find another nice movie to keep your wife happy.",Six Days Seven Nights

43,LebowskiT1000,Fun Adventure Film,9,17 October 2002,"This film was intended to be about romance and adventure, but I really wasn't feeling the romance.  In the end, I really couldn't care less if Anne Heche and Harrison Ford ended up together.  Especially since David Schwimmer's character was so likeable.  I did however want to see him end up happy (in fact, I wanted him to end up with Angelica), but they didn't follow through with his character, so we really don't know what happened to him.It may sound like I didn't like the movie, but on the contrary, I liked it a great deal, I just don't think I got out of the film what the director/writers wanted me to get out of it.  I thought the film was fun and entertaining but not superb.The cast in this film was pretty good.  Harrison Ford was excellent as always, playing a very interesting character.  David Schwimmer was superb in his role, I REALLY liked his character.  Anne Heche is pretty much the only player in the film that I'm not sure that I liked.  Don't get me wrong, she looks fantastic in the film and does a good job acting, but I'm just not sure if she was the right choice for the job.  Well, I guess there's nothing I can do about it now, so I better just shut up and deal with it. Jacqueline Obradors looked absolutely stunning in this film!  She is reason enough to watch this film!!!  Her acting is quite good too.  Temuera Morrison (who would later go on to become Jango Fett in Star Wars Attack of the Clones...and Harrison Ford played Han Solo in the original trilogy...kind of interesting) does a fine job in his role.  Cliff Curtis plays a VERY small role in this film, but does a good job and has a very cool look to him.  I'm always amazed by this guy because he looks so different in each of his films.  Danny Trejo also plays a small role, but does a fine job.  Allison Janney kind of bugs me as an actress on the whole, but her role is minimal and has very little screen time, so I can deal.All in all, this is a fun movie, with a lot of cool stuff in it, but nothing spectacular.  If you end up seeing the film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Six Days Seven Nights
44,caa821,Excellent picture - title bothers me a little,9,19 December 2006,"I liked this movie very much - Harrison Ford proved to be as adept at comedy as in his many more dramatic roles - and Ann Heche is always a pleasure to watch for me. The remainder of the cast were all excellent, and the locales interesting.You can pretty much tell where the story is going and how it will end - from very early in the picture, but that doesn't lessen its enjoyment.Just a good all-round piece of pleasant entertainment.However, the title still ""bugs"" me a bit every time I look at it. I have friends who took a ""3-day/2-night"" junket to Atlantic City. They weren't able to get settled into their hotel until later on Friday evening, and then left early on Sunday morning. They were actually on the hotel/casino's premises for about 40 hours, only a little more than 1-1/2 days in time - a third of this sleeping. While there on three different days, there were only a few hours left on Friday, and nearly all of ""Sunday"" consisted of sleeping and checking-out. If the film's resort actually advertised their offerings as ""Six Days Seven Nights,"" this would indicate, say, checking-in on Monday, and leaving following Monday, with the seven ""nights"" of Monday thru Sunday. Vegas or Atlantic City, and most other venues, would label this ""'EIGHT DAYS, seven nights."" No big deal, but just wonder every time I see it how studio came up with the title. If this were to indicate that the arrival and departure dates didn't count as ""days"" of the stay - the facility would be more forthright than any I've ever seen.",Six Days Seven Nights

Harrison Ford and Anne Heche are great together, Jacqueline Obradors is gorgeous and David Schwimmer seems to never let go of his Ross Geller character. The story is pretty funny: two people who are unlike each other get stuck on an island and need to work together to get off the island. While at the same time growing emotions with one another.

47,chrisbrown6453,"I was a little disappointed with 6 Days/7 Nights. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but there really wasn't a whole lot of substance to this movie.",5,20 July 2001,"Robin (Anne Heche) and Frank (David Schwimmer) are on vacation together when he proposes to her. She accepts, but then the next day gets called into work, and has to fly off the island for about 15 hours. The only way off the island, is the same way they got on, by flying in a small prop plane piloted by (Quinn) Harrison Ford. So as Robin and Quinn head back to Tahiti, they encounter a storm and a crash land on a deserted island. Then the rest of the movie is about the two of them surviving and falling for each other, and watching Frank and Quinn's girlfriend cope and have sex.
There were no surprises anywhere in this film, except maybe to find out that pirates still exist. From the beginning of the movie, you knew exactly what was going to happen. Frank was going to do something stupid. Robin and Quinn were going to fall in love with each other. Quinn's girlfriend was going to get naked. The engagement gets called off. Robin leaves her life in NYC to stay with Quinn. So since you know the story, the only thing left is whether or not the movie overcame the lame story. Well, it didn't.
While visually the movie was stunning, the acting didn't live up to the advance billing.  Quinn's girlfriend was a token bimbo type with a great body, just there to add a little flavor to the film. Harrison Ford was not his usual macho self, but his character seemed to be going through the motions. I didn't get a real feel for how he felt. My favorite character then had to be Frank. Schwimmer played him almost exactly like Ross on his hit TV show Friends, and here it worked. But mostly, the characters were cut out of other movies, and didn't bring anything extra to the table.",Six Days Seven Nights
48,DavidSim240183,A disjointed but amiable romantic comedy,6,30 June 2005,"I've written reviews for some of Ivan Reitman's other films in the past. When he wants to, he can make a comedy that fires on all cylinders such as Ghostbusters. That film has a daft plot, but matched it with the right actors that elevated it considerably above a very flimsy premise.But then there have been other films Reitman has made that can have good actors but fall short in other areas. Six Days Seven Nights is such a film. In fact, if it weren't for the likable pairing of Harrison Ford and Anne Heche this would have been a very flaccid affair.Beginning in New York, we're given a brief glimpse into the life of Robin Monroe (Heche). A fast talking Manhattan editor, she's about to go on holiday with her fiancée Frank (the eternally drippy David Schwimmer). What she would see in someone like him is anyone's guess.Before they can reach the island of Macatea, they have to be flown there by Quinn Harris (Ford), a grizzled, burned out drunken excuse for a pilot. Quinn and Robin don't exactly hit it off. It's at this point we know this is going to be an Opposites Attract story, something the film dutifully delivers.Robin is contacted by her boss to handle an assignment while she's at Macatea, but she needs Quinn to fly her to another island to do it. Their plane gets caught in a storm, and they're forced down onto a desert island.Now trapped in each others company, Quinn and Robin have to fight for survival until they can find a way to get off the island. Plot-wise that's about it. If the film sounds pedestrian to you up until this point, that's because it more or less is.The different chain of events that lead Quinn and Robin to be stranded on an island are nicely directed and set up in an efficient way. But once they're on the island, it's as if Ivan Reitman began to run out of ideas. He's not sure whether or not to have them bickering or looking for ways to escape.But regardless of all that, Ford and Heche make a cracking couple. Despite the obvious age difference (something they both acknowledge which I thought was a nice touch) they make a good fit. Robin is a typical brash New Yorker, and Quinn matches her sardonic wit at every turn with his wry observations. Some of their exchanges are terrific fun, and even make sense:Quinn: ""You know how a woman gets a man worked up? She shows up. Men are easy in that way.""Harrison Ford shows quite a talent for comedy with this film. Quinn has some of the self-deprecating attitude of Indiana Jones and the rugged, brash ego of Han Solo. Ford should concentrate on more comical roles now that his action man days are behind him.Anne Heche is typically hyper throughout, but watching her spark off Ford is great fun to watch. I like the scene where she's taken too many uppers when the plane's going down, and when they're discussing their prospective love lives.But as I was saying before, SDSN is a muddled affair. In desperation to give them something to do, Reitman manufactures a subplot about pirates on the island. Although exciting, it shows the fragile nature of the plot. But it does provide an atmosphere of tension towards the end, especially when it looks like Quinn and Robin might get killed now that they've admitted their love for each other.I won't beat around the bush. They do make it off the island, but the way they do it is quite clever, and that I won't spoil for you. Once they're back on the mainland, they now have to deal with the consequences, and how their experience has brought them together. Robin fills a void that's been missing from Quinn's life since his wife left him, and Quinn makes Robin realise she has no future with Frank (I could have told her that in the first five minutes).Quinn and Robin are not exactly Tracy and Hepburn, but they're not far behind. And I was genuinely happy when they finally got together. Six Days Seven Nights is an amiable film, but I feel it could have been so much more. Ford and Heche make such an engaging couple, that in an entirely different setting, this could have been a truly magical experience.",Six Days Seven Nights

Their bid for survival begins.Decent enough adventure with Harrison Ford and Anne Heche as the couple in question.

Trouble in paradise arrives by way of a phone call from her magazine about a quick assignment in Tahiti. This brings us to the crusty old (?) pilot (Harrison Ford) who is transporting her, when they run into the inevitable storm which strands them on the proverbial desert island with only each other to depend upon.This was not another African Queen or even another Romancing the Stone as may have been suggested at the time of release. There is some chemistry between the two leads, but unfortunately the script is a disaster - full of clichés, bad jokes and absolutely no excitement. The supporting cast is largely a nonentity with the exception of some embarrassing overacting in a few cases.For me Ivan Reitman is a very uneven director, some great early comedies in the 80's but after that he had less hits than he had misses.",Six Days Seven Nights

Obviously designed to attract people who want to see fireworks between him and Ann Heche, it telegraphs each plot twist and the ending. The plot, such as it is - Ms. Heche plays Robin - a career woman who takes a trip to the Pacific with her fiancé. She meets Mr. Fords character - Quinn, a pilot. Quinn is then hired to take her to Tahiti. Downed on an unknown island following a storm, they experience the inevitable run-ins with wildlife, pirates and feelings brought on by their close contact. They return to the original island and try but fail to return to their old lives. You can guess the ending.",Six Days Seven Nights
54,SMLA11,good survivor-like romance,8,1 June 2002,I enjoyed this movie mainly for the chemistry between the characters.  Anne Heche and Harrison Ford's chemistry works really good and their characters are very likeable.  Ross Schwimmer is their as Anne's boyfriend but he doesn't get stranded.  I especially enjoyed the pirate scenes.  That was cool with the cannon at the end.  quite imaginative.Overall the movie is cool with some minor flaws.  Rating 9 out of 10.,Six Days Seven Nights
55,Catharina_Sweden,So bad that it becomes good! Silly but good entertainment,7,6 May 2013,"This is one of those movies, that are so bad that they become good! I mean, as soon as you hear what it is going to be about, you realize how it is going to end (they will fall in love and end up together). You will also guess, roughly, what is going to happen on the island: the man and woman are going to go through some mishaps and adventures, that force them to cooperate and save each others lives. And in the process, they are going to get their eyes open as to each other's good qualities. True: you can just tick the mishaps and adventures off: there is the earthquake, and there are the pirates that give Mr Ford an opportunity to show the girl what a master fighter he is, and there is the old crashed plane that gives Mr Ford an opportunity to show what a master engineer he is, and there is the snake in Miss Heche's panties (wherever else..?), that gives Mr Ford a chance to get into her panties quite literally, and there... Well, you get the idea! :-)The fact that the man and woman should be from entirely different worlds and have - up to then - quite the opposite goals and life-styles is also a prerequisite, that you guess at before the movie has even begun.To sum it up: this movie is VERY predictable, and it contains ALL the clichés... But is it a bad movie..? NO! The movie-makers know how to push your buttons, because all those clichés are exactly what push your buttons whether you want to admit it or not! ...and the thought of spending a week on a desert island with Harrison Ford makes a woman's imagination working overtime..! :-) It is very good as pure entertainment goes!",Six Days Seven Nights
56,stills-6,A movie that should not have been made,4,8 March 2000,"This could have been an interesting romantic comedy if the writers had any imagination at all. I would pay to see Harrison Ford in a romance with intelligent things to say, like in Working Girl and Sabrina. There would be no need for the stupidity of the whole ""pirates"" idea.I'd never seen Anne Heche before, and I think this movie was a bad introduction for her. I can see why she might be a good actress given another type of role - but in this movie she's just awful. I doubt it's her fault (except for taking the role in the first place). There's no personality or humor in the story, and it's not especially romantic. The previews want you to believe that this movie is Romancing the Stone. I suggest watching that movie instead.",Six Days Seven Nights

58,bayardhiler,What Are People Thinking?.......,3,17 November 2012,"Usually when I make a comment like that on this site, I'm complaining about how good movies can receive low scores. However this time its the opposite; how can such a bad movie like this receive such a high score plus outstanding reviews to boot? Were those people watching the same movie? I saw this movie quite a while ago and the only reason why I am even talking about it is because I recently saw a story on cinema blender that suggested this would be a great idea for a remake. The problem is that the movie barely registered in my memory (never a good sign when measuring the entertainment value of a film) and then I remembered how boring it was. This was supposed to be a romance, comedy, and action all in one where Harrison Ford and Anne Heche are stranded on a desert island, they hate each other, are forced to band together, and then fall in love. One basic problem of the plot is how is that a sophisticated New York woman like Anne Heche, can fall for a man over half her age? I mean, Harrison Ford is not exactly a young chicken here. All this might be forgiven if the movie wasn't so darn boring. The comedy falls flat, much of the movie is nothing but Ford and Heche arguing, and even when some pirates show up, there just doesn't seem to be any thrill at all. Some people here have said the movie failed at the box office because of the fact that Anne Hache was dating Ellen DeGeneres at the time and people simply discriminated against the movie for that reason. Please folks, lets not use excuses like that to cover up a bad movie. To sum it up, ""Six Days Seven Nights"" is something that should stay in the past. Period.",Six Days Seven Nights

I'm easily irritated and bugged by stupid movies, stupid actors and stupid plots. When this started I was bugged that they were trying to portray Heche as sexy and by the end I found her adorable. Ford always does a good confused face, which he did often! The movie was fun, light and kept my attention... keeps ya entertained! This was a good movie without many ""oh come on... who would do that"" moments! Which is a win in my book.
I really liked this movie... good times!",Six Days Seven Nights
60,The_Orenda,"Not bad, old fashioned-Reitman stuff.",5,17 October 2007,"Six Days Seven Nights is another one of the many movies out there that makes no pretensions as to containing anything special or different from the others. Ivan Reitman has created a niche in telling the Hollywood story, he knows the deal. You get attractive leads. You make a situation where they are put on an island and through urgency, they have to work together. It's all very standard stuff. But Reitman fills in whatever void he can with comedy and it's purely hit-and-miss from how you feel about it.Robin, recently engaged and on vacation, seeks the help of Quinn, who seeks solitude and the simple life after a world of hurt. Quinn flew her to their vacation spot, but for several hundred more dollars, she enlists his help to fly her to Tahiti for a quick assignment her job asks of her. A storm downs them on a remote island and they're stuck with each other.How Ford and Heche work on screen is so important for a film that commands it, but the story is so by-the-numbers, you may find yourself wondering when the couple will just cut to the chase and get off the island. The more interesting side-story, with Angelica and Frank, is played pleasantly well. But the whole story is just too cheesy sometimes. That fickle moral of love and doing what's best, once again, is played so unrealistically, yet so obvious.",Six Days Seven Nights
61,llihilloh,Good idea.,6,31 January 2001,"I really liked this film. While the casting was a little off, I still enjoyed the main characters. Especially Anne Heche's role. The shooting was nicely done and it was a film that isn't the ordinary Hollywood kind where it takes place in a studio. This movie is good because it is funny, semi-dramatic, has action, and it's not a movie that was made to change something. Here you have a nice little film that is good to watch when you want a taste of the different genres. I don't think that it was given too much publicity when it was released in the theatres, and that's mainly why I never saw it until a couple of weeks ago when it was on TV. It's cute!I enjoyed that the main female role was given to Anne Heche. She was perfect for the role because she is terribly underrated and I hope that this opened some career options for her. In my opinion, Heche can deliver comedy and drama. Some of the writing that was meant to be funny couldn't be pulled off (by Ford), but Anne did a good job. Another thing that I liked about her is that she must have been in excellent shape to pull the role off. Every film has stunt men/women, but it was pretty obvious that the two main actors did some running, swimming, etc. Casting Harrison Ford as the lead male seemed to be a mistake. I'll admit that this was the second movie that I have seem him in. I know he's supposed to be like the greatest actor now days, but I wasn't too impressed. Anyway, he really didn't fit the description as a tough pilot who gets stranded on an island. Another thing that I found odd was why the part of Monroe's fiance was played by David Schwimmer. Other than the complete failure of on screen chemistry between the two, I also frowned on the stupidity that was given to his character. The writing for him was dull and poorly written out, as well as the whole thing with him and Angelica. Boring. Sure, his character was needed and the movie wouldn't have made a whole lot of sense without him, but the crew should have casted someone else. Such as a lesser known actor. I'm not even going to comment on the role and actress of Angelica. Just that it/she was bad.The plot was creative but somewhat original. It's like Gilligan's Island without the S.S. Minnow, but like something else that I have seen before. I can't quite remember but I know that I've seen the whole 'I can't stand you but we're going to have to get along one way or another' idea before. The shooting locations (scenery) was really well put together. This film had a good atmosphere all around. I also liked the different stunts that the movie called for. Monroe and Harris were fit and looked good while trying to survive on an island. Three things I had a problem with. One - the story circling around the pirates was kind of bland not to mention un-necessary. This idea that took up a total of five minutes could have been left out and wouldn't have made a difference. Two - after everything Heche went through, specifically towards the end, she still continued to have her makeup on when the going got tough. I know, not a big deal but everything else was well thought out, I was just disappointed to see that a mistake like this was left in. And third - I found it very unbelievable that a pilot and a woman that was new to the outdoors managed to fix a plane and actually got it to fly again. The pilot could have done this but I still didn't buy it. Those were the things I had some troubles with but everything else was pleasing.Watch this movie if you want a cute, funny, little movie with a partially good cast. Despite what most people thought, I found that this was one of the better films that has a simple plot but turned into something that was very enjoyable.",Six Days Seven Nights
62,Dar Star,What was Harrison thinking?,2,9 December 1998,"Well at least Harrison Ford got a nice Polynesian vacation out of this deal, because this is by far his most utterly forgettable film. There is no plot whatsoever. The inclusion of PIRATES??? into the story is all one needs to understand as far as how the film has no antagonist. The biggest mistake was having Ford and Heche acknowledge their feelings for each other so early in the movie. They were a lot more interesting when they were sniping at each other. Once things get mushy all interest is lost. The only reason to check out this film is for the scenery and the gorgeous Jacqueline Obradors in her underwear.",Six Days Seven Nights

After 10 minutes in seeing Ross Gellar I knew this was gonna be one of those unfunny trashy comedies. How could a respectable actor like Harrison Ford lend himself to such garbage? The girl he was stuck with was extremely unattractive, had the most annoying headache inducing voice, constantly b!tching (bad script) and had the ugliest haircut.There was no chemistry at all between the two leads and that maybe has something to do with Anne Heche being a lesbian in real life. This could have been a great film has they made it more serious, had an intelligent script and way less pointless dialog. Quality not quantity!

66,jax713,I can't help myself when it comes to Harrison Ford...,8,30 December 2005,"I rented this a few days ago having discovered it was a Harrison Ford movie I somehow missed. Even though I'm a big fan of his, I really didn't expect much based on the jacket description. But, Eureka! I was completely charmed by this movie. Ford has a very low key way of delivering comedy and when you see a manly man like him being funny, it is all the more hilarious. Anne Heche is captivating as the gamin New York fashion sophisticate who happens to be very smart & sassy but grounded. She also has a tremendous flair for comedy and she plays off Ford in a grand way that Melanie Griffith couldn't even dream about doing in Working Girl. Griffith sleepwalked through that script whereas Heche embraces her character fully.There is a very unique thing that happens in this film that we don't see very often and that is how the romantic chemistry builds between the lead characters. It is as natural as the flora and fauna of the island they are trapped on - rather randomly and sometimes awkwardly taking root - and I give a lot of credit to Reitman for capturing this feeling between Ford & Heche. With most films like this, the leads either hop into bed right away and then sort out their differences, or there is no indication of increasing mutual affection until the last 10 minutes when someone slaps their forehead and a light goes on. In this movie, you see so many small moments when one character is creeping into the heart of the other. Despite this, it never gets sappy.I'd rate this movie as a 7 but am giving it an 8 to try to raise its overall score. It's a very, very good romantic comedy with a funny script, witty direction, great tropical locales, and an eclectic but engaging supporting cast.",Six Days Seven Nights

69,maitreg,Boring,4,8 January 2001,"This movie was obviously a very weak attempt to make some sort of modern ""Swiss Family Robinson"".  It doesn't fly.  The storyline is very weak and simply unbelievable.  The romance between Quinn (Harrison Ford) and Robin (Anne Heche) on the island doesn't seem to have any basis whatsoever and it just appears out of nowhere.  The other romance between Frank (David Schwimmer) and Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors) is so poorly acted, it's like something out of an 80's B movie.The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the scenery was good. The writing was terrible.  The acting was below average.  Hardly any of it was believable.  It was almost as if the writer had in mind:""Ok, crash a plane.  Now I want these two to have sex later, so I have to find something to fill in the space....I've got it!  Pirates!!""Yuck.  I gave it 4 out of 10.

Well, what if 17 years later, Harrison Ford played a guy very much like Jock in a rom-com set in modern-day Polynesia?This is what happened, but at the time the movie came out Anne Heche was just coming out of a highly publicized romance with. Ellen DeGeneres, so the buzz around the time 6D7N came out was, ""See Anne Heche play straight in a movie with Indiana Jones.""So, it took more than two decades later to appreciate this movie for what it really is, a fun adventure rom-com with good pacing, beautiful scenery, a nice score, and some nice chemistry between not only Harrison and Anne but.also between David Schwimmer and. Jacqueline Obradors, the secondary characters.One example and one of the funniest lines from the movie happens when. Frank and Angelica end up together when. Quinn and Robin (Harrison/Anne) are presumed lost at sea from a possiblly fatal airplane crash. Angelica, trying to comfort Frank from straying says, ""It's just like what happens after a funeral. Everyone has sex."" Frank gazes at her blankly and whines, ""Not everybody.""Yes, it's predictable and even outlandish in places, but never stretches the willing suspension of disbelief too far.

73,glentom1,David Schwimmer at his best!,8,27 July 2006,"Schwimmer doesn't get any better than this. He puts everything he has into this role, and there is only one reason he didn't get an Oscar nomination for his acting in this movie. That reason is: HE SUCKS! Why would anyone ever cast Schwimmer in a movie? He is not funny, he is not good looking, and most importantly, HE IS A VERY VERY BAD ACTOR!OK, enough of him. I might have given this movie a 7/10 if he had not been in it. Harrison Ford does his best, and he has a lot of funny lines; he is not the fault in this movie. And Anne Heche is a pretty fair actress and delivers some funny lines as well.BUT!...I really didn't care about seeing Heche's body, her cleavage or the ever-present nipple shots. Those types of shots are usually reserved for very nice looking women, and she is very average in face and body.And what is with the pirates?? It was OK to bring them into the play once, but why would they risk their lives tracking down Harrison and Heche? I mean, what did they have to gain? Pirates (by definition) are usually out for gain, not revenge, so it just didn't make sense.Back to Schwimmer, did I mention that he SUCKS? I am really really offended by having to watch Schwimmer in this movie, he is a REALLY REALLY BAD ACTOR!OK, enough of him (again). In the end there is some good chemistry between Heche and Ford.

Doesn't look like it will ever be released on BR. Finally bought in on Amazon Prime just because we wanted it in HD.My wife and I have always loved this movie.Anne Heche was surprisingly adorable and who doesn't love Harrison? Total social opposites from the get-go. No way a romance could ever develop, right?I imagine the chemistry of their unlikely mutual attraction derives from the fact that it quickly became primal. Their opposite lifestyle and environmental backgrounds instantly became irrelevant as they worked together to save their own lives (from peril I won't detail here.)
Another aspect is the island they're stranded on; Makatea. Now I don't know where this was actually filmed, but having been to Tahiti myself, it sure could be an outlying territory of French Polynesia, (as it purports to be), because it's drop dead gorgeous.In supporting roles, David Schwimmer does a great job (as the soon to be X fiancée of Heche), and islander Jacqueline Obradors (maybe 3 years before landing her role as Detective Ortiz on NYPD Blue), is so cute, dizzy, hot & sexy it's ridiculous.This flick kind of has a ""Romancing the Stone"" flavor to it.One of our top, favorite go-to fun flicks.Bob R.",Six Days Seven Nights

90,spaceboy_a,"'Six Days Seven Nights' of fun, action and romance...",8,25 March 2001,"'Six Days Seven Nights' took a lot of flack upon it's release mainly due to the fact that Anne Heche (Psycho, Return to Paradise) had just outed herself as a lesbian and audiences thought it to be inappropriate and unbelievable for Heche to be paired up with Harrison Ford. Looking at the film now, one must wonder what all the fuss was about as Heche puts in a very convincing performance.Directed by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Kindergarten Cop), the film tells the story of Robin Moore, a successful magazine editor (Heche) who is going on a dream vacation with her fiance, Frank (David Schwimmer - TV's Freinds). The holiday becomes a nightmare when she has to return to the mainland for a photo shoot and her plane crashes on a remote island leaving her stranded with pilot Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford).From there on, the two battle to survive not only each other but a band of pirates led by Temura Morrison (Once Were Warriors, Speed 2). Robin and Quinn's love / hate relationship soon blossoms into a lot more over their time in this remote paradise.This is such a great film that is not only entertaining but also genuinely funny as well. Among the funniest scene's is when the plane is crashing, we see Heche take a large amount of Zanex to help her relax as well as a some great one liners from Harrison Ford. The only thing that really holds the film back is David Schwimmer who becomes quite annoying by the end of the film. The two leads are both great in their roles despite the fact that Harrison Ford looked a little old for Heche. There is also some superb photography as well as a great score from Randy Elderman (Toy Story).'Six Days Seven Nights' is a nice piece of light entertainment for those who enjoy something with a bit of everything like action, adventure, comedy and romance. SCORE: 7.5/10",Six Days Seven Nights

They are usually filled with long and pathetic overly prolonged scenes, where people supposedly express their feelings, in a totally unrealistic way. In a way only american can think of.Not this one however. I totally enjoyed the way this one was put together. The feelings of actors, who mattered, were expressed realistically, not dragging them on gleefully in a way that usually makes me bang my head against the wall when watching Hollywood movies. The characters felt much deeper this way.Of other characters, we had a total looser, playing a total looser, and a sexy bimbo playing a sexy bimbo. So I even liked the casting, although that looser indeed was a looser.Anyway. It was my first hollywood romantic/comedy/action that I thoroughly enjoyed without any reservations.",Six Days Seven Nights

95,Bogie27,It's like a small vacation,8,1 November 2009,"I don't write many reviews, unless I really feel close to the movie or believe it was unfairly rated, like this one. This movie has found it's way back to my DVD player several times since it's first release to DVD about 10 years ago. It whisks you up from your easy chair to a sunny vacation spot in the Polynesian Islands and never slows up or misses a beat. One scene moves to the next in a seamless manner often foreshadowed by a soundtrack that is very good and quite catchy.The film was well cast with Harrison Ford as the crusty cargo pilot - Ann Heche as the assistant editor of a fashion magazine - David Swimmer as her pasty but very nice fiancé and Jacqueline Obradors as the beautiful but dingbat club dancer. This romantic comedy and action adventure film pits two people together from different backgrounds and age groups. Normally the two would never get along long enough to get to know the other. But, forced to spend time together and under challenging conditions, a small attraction begins to develop and grow stronger. The character development of the cast moves forward with the same speed as the rest of this cute story.While the film is certainly not for everyone, judging from IMDb ratings and rotten tomatoes, I really believe it was the message and not the movie that failed to impress. This story expresses a throwback to traditional values in the relationship of Ford and Heche and their experiences on the Island. This may explain the reaction to the film by many of the younger viewers. Some of the more mature viewers may have been turned off by news of Ann Heche and Ellen Degeneres in real life. This may explain why some seem to love the movie, while others have curiously rated it rather poorly.In any case, if you need a quick escape and love flying to beautiful Polynesian Islands loaded with beautiful scenery and good-looking people, then his film may be your ticket!",Six Days Seven Nights

Oh no - comically, blown up in the plane - but undamaged! Food? A cute little beach picnic.But I think - you need to draw the lines at 1) pirates who have an endless supply of ammo, yet are the worse shots in the universe. 2) Finding pontoons completely in tact?

97,MTGrizzly,Good all around movie...,7,8 May 2005,"There was a lot to like about this movie. The scenery, (Hawaii, not Obradors), was fantastic. The acting was superb. While the plot held no surprises, (once you understand the premise of the film, you know right where it is going, but, in the case of this movie, it was fun to find out how they get there), it was interesting. The gags were very funny, (particularly when Heche's character displays the her inability to cope in situations where there aren't subways and cell phones.).The movie showcased the range of both Heche and Ford. It might have done the same for Schwimmer and Obradors, if they had significant roles. Since I have never seen a single episode of ""Friends"", (I know, I must be the only person in the world who hasn't), I cannot compare Schwimmer's acting in this movie with his role in ""Friends."" His acting in this movie didn't compare to his role as Lt./Captain Sobel in ""Band of Brothers."" Based on this role and ""Band of Brothers"", it seems to show that Schwimmer has a lot of range and can play different roles very well. Schwimmer does seem to be typecast as the inept ""loser"" who tries hard and always comes out second in the end. Unfortunately, he and Obradors seem to be limited to supporting , rather than starring, roles.So, if you are looking for a light, funny way to spend an evening, watch this movie.",Six Days Seven Nights

This cliché is tolerable to me only if the pair have a good, witty, energetic script (because this situation has to be humorous or it is just overdone and lame) and are playing off each other with almost visible sparks. None of that is happening here. If the woman had been less strident and stiff in the role, I could perhaps have semi-ignored her and pretended I was stuck on a desert island with Harrison Ford instead of her... but at least she has real presence, if not a lot of talent, so ignoring her was not an option.",Six Days Seven Nights

In ""Six Days, Seven Nights"" Anne Heche plays a business woman who is engaged to an overbearing guy named Frank, played by David Shwimmer. When they go away to a romantic island, they meet the laid back, drunken pilot, Harrison Ford. His character Quinn is not as Anne Heche quotes, ""one of those guys who you send out into the wilderness with a cutip and a pocket knife and they build you a shopping mall."" His character is actually realistic unlike Indiana Jones or his president at kombat in ""Air Force One"". The movie is also rather life like itself which you will see as they prepare to leave the island. Instead of a miracle appearing out of nowhere in the middle of the film, you actually see them building and working as you would have to if you were stranded on an island.From the moment Ford and Heche meet you feel the connection they have to each other. Rather than taking a liking to each other from the beginning of the film, they constantly bicker and argue over the funniest topics, one of them being Anne Heche's t**s! When it gets towards the end of the movie they obviously start falling for each other (just like every other typical romantic comedy), but this one I enjoyed imparticularly. Other than it starring two of my favorite actors, it was unpredictable. When they get off the island it looks as if they are going to go their own separate ways, which you would never suspect in a romantic comedy. Besides this, it also throws in some great action sequences including a chase scene with pirates. This is why this film is a perfect date movie, it has the romance for the woman and the action for the men!The acting is also superb. If you had never heard of Anne Heche you would mistake her as a heterosexual. She shows no signs of homosexuality the entire movie. And in my own opinion, it shouldn't matter if she is gay. It is a great film and she is a talented actress. Harrison Ford is also terrific in his first romantic comedy since ""Sabrina"".

The only reason I did not leave the movie during those two playing was because of Mr. Ford's reliable performance. Air Force One was really a pity, because it started out quite well, but from about the half of it it flopped. As for the Devil's Own it was a real disappointment since Alan J. Pakula and Ford had done a great job in Presumed Innocent. 6D7N did not want to be anything else but a light summer comedy-romance-adventure and with all its shortcomings in the story it served this purpose very well. It had a good rhythm and music, the photography was impressive and both the supporting actors and leading characters delivered a very funny performance. Even though Ford did not look like 45 at all, more like 55, his masculinity and the character he played were convincing enough for him to be the right choice for woman who could have been his daughter. ""We may be old, but sturdy."" Ford is great in comedies and would be fun to see him in some more.

Six Days, Seven Nights is a 1998 adventure-comedy film directed by Ivan Reitman and starring Harrison Ford and Anne Heche. The screenplay was written by Michael Browning. It was filmed on location in Kauai and released on June 12, 1998. The main character of this movie is named Robin and it is very curious because she finds herself on a desert island in company with the pilot Quinine, who had to catch her to Tahiti like Robinson.
Their romantic story is at the heart of this movie. There two other characters who connect with the main two - Frank and Angelica.
So there are two men characters - Frank and Quinine, and two women characters - Robin and Angelica. And such a set of characters is thought of as an antagonistic one.
Sweetie Frank on the beginning of the story is Robin's boyfriend. On first sight Frank is very romantic person. But it is deceptive conclusion. He is very pragmatic one, he is very gentle person, weak and dependent of company he gets on. His vision of life is stereotypical and that's why he can't understand that there is no different for lovers to be on tropical island or office when they love each other. His antagonist - Quinine do understand it. The dialog between Quinine and Robin when he says: They come here looking for ""the magic,"" expecting to find romance...when they can't find it any other place. It's an island, babe. If you don't bring it here, you won't find it here; is the keynote, main message of this movie.
So Quinine is rude, cynic, but the brave person and he had some sorrowful story on his past life.
Frank seems to live in an illusory world where everything happens on time and place it has to - like in movies - for example, he sure that engagement has to estate on a such a romantic place like the island he took his girlfriend on.
Quinine overcomes his best friend sell out and heartbreak that is why he found a better way of life, ""Came out here, got a nice, little house on a beautiful beach. Got his plane. Doing what he wants to do. Got peace and quiet"".
Quinine throws out the comforts of the big world where women wanted men who weren't afraid to cry, who were in touch with their feminine side (like Frank is).
Robin is very decisive and conscientious person but while living in the big town she is treating with modern aberrations that's why Frank is her boyfriend. But when she is caught on the desert island with Quinine she tells him that women like men mean and armed, all the more so when they're being chased by pirates (it is another detail of their adventure).
Eventually, the adventure helps both of them to understand what they want indeed. Quinine realizes that his broken heart can love again and Robin understands that she wants to be with some real men not with a sweetie infantile person, who gives you away in severities.
So six days and seven nights on the desert island rock the world of the main character of this movie - They fall in love with each other. They get a chance to meet each other and have an opportunity to crush their common-and-garden vision of life while stemming difficulties. They succeeded in making out of each other, they managed to get a sight of themselves.Lugowska",Six Days Seven Nights
127,reesesb4mnms,See Whatcha Get,10,24 July 2005,"This film probably wasn't made to make you laugh nonstop, but when they turn on the humor, the writers and those involved with the final cut have very nice timing and awesome lines! This movie is one of my favorites, because if i'm having a bad day...they (Heche and Harrison) are having a much worse one and manage to pick up my mood with the delivery of lines that make me laugh, so, yeah the humor. But also the style, pacing, and emotional involvement they make me feel as a viewer. I'm invested. And though I may think that Schwimmer's character is a shmuck, I can understand his POV, so, he's okay. David and the cast did an outstanding job, and while the filmed script may not have been the original one (I'd love to see it sometime) the end result is fabulous. If you haven't seen it, you should, and I hope you too laugh, and smile, and chuckle, and enjoy a rather grand movie. Enjoy!",Six Days Seven Nights

129,gavint-75205,Not as Bad as the rating suggests.,7,29 November 2020,Not as Bad as the rating suggests. Is it the best Harrison Ford Movie? No. Is it the worst Harrison Ford movie? No. Just an overall fun time.,Six Days Seven Nights
130,Jal,Love story?,1,4 October 1998,An incredibly dull cocktail of all the worst trivialities seen in the last decades of love movies.,Six Days Seven Nights
131,Weasel-2,Mindless but pleasant.,6,24 February 1999,"Most of the movie's modest pleasures are derived from watching Harrison Ford reprise his Star Wars character in a tropical setting.  He and Heche have nice chemistry, and the whole thing passes mindlessly and pleasantly. Except for a couple of crashes, this has all the makings of a swell transcontinental plane ride film.",Six Days Seven Nights
132,BigYap,Good star chemistry,9,3 January 1999,"Schwimmer was weak, but the chemistry between Heche and Ford was magical, despite the difference in age between them.  Heche was especially surprising in the comic development of her character.",Six Days Seven Nights
133,Bandit-17,OK no-brainer rental,4,15 February 1999,"For the actors, you'd expect more.  However, it was just a fun, no-thinking mostly comedic movie.  It's weird seeing Ford in such a 'basic' role, but also sort of refreshing.Nothing to write home about though.",Six Days Seven Nights
134,sawdust-3,Disappointing.,4,8 January 1999,"This was a big disappointment, The setting had so much possibility and with Harrison Ford, the potential was great.  However, the plot was just a string of predictable cheap movie moments.  A good screen writer could have made this into a really good movie.  As it was, it was mildly entertaining, Ford was good as usual and probably the only thing that saved this movie from being a dog.  It was obviously made in a hurry with not much thought going into a real plot nor in making the action scenes very interesting.",Six Days Seven Nights
135,kaiser-24,disappointing...,1,30 August 1999,"After I watched this movie I couldn't help but wonder why would  Ford take part in such a miserable work. The least I can say is that the story is  silly , the humor  pathetic  , and the way the movie comes to an end ridiculous. This movie should have been made with cartoon characters , or better yet , not made at all.",Six Days Seven Nights
136,rjordanski,did Heche go straight after this movie?,9,10 May 2006,"Does anyone know if this movie with Harrison Ford was somewhat responsible for Anne Heche having a change of heart, dropping Ellen Degeneres and going straight?? I think I heard that somewhere.When you watch the movie you notice that the two got along famously and appeared to REALLY enjoy one another. I just know that it was about the time that this movie was being shot and released that Heche left her girl pal.I'd appreciate any serious commentary on this... Thanks!A reel movie buff...",Six Days Seven Nights
137,wshort34,Loved it,10,22 October 2006,"Thought this was a lovely movie, specially an old guy getting the younger woman, liked the theme of good but old winning out over young and stupid.Anne heche looked adorable in this movie, she should do more roles like this one instead of most of the crappy roles she does.She is a very gifted actress and should be given better roles, granted she has had a difficult past and childhood but she can really nail it when she wants to.Wonder if she really likes over 50 guy in real life if so i would gladly offer my services.",Six Days Seven Nights
138,citizencolton,"Give it a go, Joe",8,3 September 2001,"This is an enjoyable flick, if you've not seen it give it a go.  The first half is certainly better than the second, funnier too, but on the whole it is good.  Harrison Ford is always good money, and the  rest of the cast do a good job also (though David Shwimmer eventually just gets on my nerves). The soundtrack is great too.   So all in all, recommended if you've not yet seen it.",Six Days Seven Nights
139,JimDavB1,a missed blooper,8,8 November 2009,"When they found the water and she goes in, something swims in her shorts. After Harrison Ford pulls out a snake he sniffs his finger and smiles. That was funny. The movie overall was a great movie and fun to watch. It had enough action to keep action movie goers interested and had enough romance to keep my wife teary eyed. I think the funniest part in the whole movie was when Anne Hesch was caught in the plane from the life raft blowing up and was pushed up against the window of the plane. I was surprised to see David Schwimmer cheat on his fiancé so early in their relationship but it was good to see Harrison Ford and Anne Hesch get together in the end.",Six Days Seven Nights
140,psy_uwa,Not too violent...,10,29 April 2003,"...yes, the violence comes as a bit of a shock but it's not gratuitous and doesn't last very long, it also ends with a beautiful hand-of-God act. This is basically a feel-good film, we've watched it 10 times in the last month or so in VERY SENSITIVE STATES OF MIND and think it's in the same class as Casablanca.  Everything is perfect: script, actors, setting, photography, soundtrack.  Like Casablanca, both the morality and the spirituality  are of the highest standard.",Six Days Seven Nights
141,vicki-simpson,The best Romantic comedy ever!!,10,15 January 2004,"You could cut the sexual tension in this movie with a knife. The actors worked well together and build up this love-hate thing till the climax! Well worth viewing!! Did not see this film till it was recomended by a friend, glad i took his advice! Watch it, you'll love it!!",Six Days Seven Nights
142,tootsiewag,This is a Harrison Ford must see!,8,15 July 2020,"I've loved this movie since I saw it in the theater, so when it came out on DVD, I quickly added it to my movie library. I've probably seen it at least six or seven times by now.Is the plot perfect? No. The critics knock it for it's less than perfect plot flow, calling it choppy. I don't care what the critics say because I like the humor, the drama, and the chemistry that both Harrison Ford and Anne Heche deliver.Is the situation in the movie credible? Maybe not, but who cares? It's fun, suspenseful, and emotionally satisfying. And if you like Harrison Ford even a little bit, you have to see this one.",Six Days Seven Nights
143,Paulo-Sargaco,Dreaming of Quinn Harris' life,6,12 July 2006,"I don't consider this movie to be anything near relevant to the History of Cinema, but the fact is that it has shown me the life I would like to live. I could well picture myself as Quinn Harris, on a Pacific island, providing air taxi services. Maybe with a little less drinking, but definitely that kind of life would appeal to me. If only...This movie is an extremely pleasant experience, with it's competent photography work, good acting, a little bit of everything, as in romance, humor, hints of sex, adventure, bad guys, city life vs life in an island, you name it (and under certain limitations), you got it. I'll probably end up buying this one.",Six Days Seven Nights
144,matt_baz,Don't believe the low rating. This is a great romcom,10,5 September 2021,I really don't get the low rating for this. It's a great romcom. Not to be taken seriously as usual with this genre but I loved watching HF in a different role. Give it a chance.,Six Days Seven Nights
145,aurelie88_14,one of the most romantic movies!!!!,10,13 July 2005,"this movie is really wonderful, from the beginning to the end. I really love funny love stories, and this is a perfect example of it!!! It's about a Jung female who lives in New York and about here fiancée, actually her fiancée when there on the island, but when she has to go back for her job, she asks her pilot who flew them there to bring her, what also happens, but there's a big Storm and they crash on an island!! and in the beginning it's very funny, but when they see pirates it's getting serious. The scenes I liked the most where the one where they kissed for the first time after they jumped of a rock, and the one where Quinn says that he wanna kiss her again, and of course the end was also beautiful !!!!",Six Days Seven Nights
146,scarpj,Can watch this anytime it comes on TV,10,11 June 2020,"Like others, I don't understand the low ratings for this movie. It's one of those I can tune in at any point and enjoy. Funny, with some great lines and ""moments."" Good chemistry and romance. They don't even try to make movies like this anymore.",Six Days Seven Nights

149,dvkieft,"six days, seven nights",1,30 March 2006,"This is on the tube tonight. I am watching it just to make sure it is the worst movie I ever saw. Anne Hache is terrible. Harrison Ford, great as he is hates making it. Harrison has this really hot babe back at the island and is trying to pick up Anne Hache. Give me a break. The Friend's guy is especially bad. I see this getting like 5 stars on reviews. Are you crazy? Anne Hache is such an unlikeable character you want he killed off back at the island. And what about that stupid agent she has. They crash and Anne says get me a cup of coffee and trips. This is after a plane crash. The ending is especially terrible. They really could have made this interesting. I really wanted to see a good movie. They butchered it worse than Tin Cup and that is saying something. What a waste of talent.",Six Days Seven Nights
