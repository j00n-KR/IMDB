0,TheLittleSongbird,The first and best of the series,8,4 October 2010,"While decidedly languid and a tad too short, this is the first and best of the tales about the Australian living legend. The scenery and cinematography are very nice, and there are entertaining and somewhat informative parts in the script. The story is engaging too, and has both funny and quite tense bits. The direction is fine, and the acting is good enough. Paul Hogan is a very likable, charismatic and funny hero, and Linda Kozslowski is decent support. As for the sequels, the second was inferior but passable but the third isn't really worth bothering with. This though, while not perfect is the real deal and works as solid entertainment. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Crocodile Dundee
1,Leofwine_draca,Classic fish-out-of-water comedy,6,28 October 2017,"CROCODILE DUNDEE is a film every bit as likable and laid back as its main character. It's really the love child of Paul Hogan, who really had no career of any kind outside of this role. CROCODILE DUNDEE is a classic fish-out-of-water comedy in which an adventurer from the Australian outback arrives in New York and proceeds to experience a vivid kind of culture shock. I normally don't care for romantic comedies, but this one's genuinely funny, with sharp one-liners and edgy humour that wouldn't pass muster these days. Hogan is excellent in the part and dripping with charisma, while Linda Kozlowski makes an impact in what could have been an insipid part. Watch out for David Gulpilil's cameo, the funniest part of the film for me.",Crocodile Dundee
2,SnoopyStyle,Fun iconic cheesy character of the 80s,7,10 August 2014,"Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) is a Newsday writer who was due back already but she hears a story about Michael J. ""Crocodile"" Dundee (Paul Hogan) who survived a crocodile attack in the Australian outback. He's a guide with his best friend Walter Reilly (John Meillon) based out of Walkabout Creek. He takes her out to the outback encountering aboriginal friend Neville Bell (David Gulpilil). She falls for Dundee and takes him back to NYC. Her overbearing boss Richard Mason (Mark Blum) is her boyfriend back home.I love the sly humor taking shots at some of stereotypes. Of course, it created one of the most iconic stereotypical character of the 80s. Some of humor is still there but much of it is dated. It's still a charmer and a fun movie. I do wish they limit some of the modern world jokes. They don't all work if they keep doing them. It's a case of less is more.",Crocodile Dundee
3,gavin6942,An 80s Classic,6,16 November 2014,"An American reporter (Linda Kozlowski) goes to the Australian outback to meet an eccentric crocodile poacher (Paul Hogan) and invites him to New York City.Love it or hate it, ""Crocodile Dundee"" was a huge hit in the 1980s, and made a boatload of money. Paul Hogan is still famous today (2014), more or less just for portraying this single role. That is rather impressive.Some parts of the film are pretty funny, while others are a tad boring. The romantic subplot tends to drag down the pace and humor, and actually ends up making the film not nearly as good as it could have been. This is one of the few ""classics"" that has been outdone by its sequel.",Crocodile Dundee
4,lee_eisenberg,"ironically, as a result, the Australian people are a little ticked off at Paul Hogan",7,8 October 2007,"I have to say that while ""Crocodile Dundee"" isn't the greatest movie ever, it certainly has it's moments. One might actually derive something about the theme of communication issues in Australian cinema: having spent his entire life in the Outback, Mick experiences culture shock in New York, and assumes that an African-American man is an Aborigine! A sad irony to the movie's success is the Australian people's anger at Paul Hogan. It's not just that the flick made non-Aussies view the country as people like Mick. You see, the people Down Under like to talk about cutting down the tall poppy, which means making sure that no one can consider him/herself better than everyone else. After the movie's success, Hogan's marriage collapsed and he married his co-star Linda Kozlowski. As far as the Aussies are concerned, he decided that he's better than them. Is this really what our world has come to?! But no matter. It is a pretty funny film. Sort of a precursor to ""Borat"" without all the teenage boy humor. I should say that the stuff about hunting crocs illegally made me cringe a little, but otherwise I liked it, and I'm sure that you will too.PS: Neville was played by David Gulpilil, the Aboriginal actor who also starred in ""Walkabout"", ""The Last Wave"" and ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"".",Crocodile Dundee
5,jboothmillard,"""Crocodile"" Dundee",7,4 January 2011,"The title gave me a clue about what the lead character had an association with, but other than that the only thing I knew is that he was Australian, and I had missed it a few times, then I got my chance. Basically New York reporter Sue Charlton (Golden Globe nominated Linda Kozlowski) has heard about a man who survived a crocodile attack in Australia, and she thinks it will a make a good story, so she travels out there to meet and interview the man himself. The man in question is crocodile hunter and co-owner of a safari business, Michael J. ""Crocodile"" Dundee (Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Paul Hogan, also writing) who runs the business with Walter Reilly (John Meillon), his trusted friend and mentor. The interview is pretty straight forward, so then he offers to take Sue on a tour of the park which lasts a few days, one day they are attacked by another crocodile which Mick saves her from. After learning so much about Mick during this time she certainly has enough for a story, but she thinks there will be more to add if he accepts her invitation to come back to America with her, he does. He of course has never been, so he is fascinated by the new life style he has come into, and all the different cultures of people around him, he is essentially a fish out of water. Mostly everyone he comes into contact with as he explores the city and everything it has to offer are quickly lightened up with his naivety to city life, but there are those who threaten him and he gets his large knife out to scare them off. She may be romantically involved with her boss, the dull editor Richard Mason (Mark Blum), but slowly Sue is also becoming very affectionate towards the friendly Aussie bushman. It is after being proposed to by Richard that Sue realises her true feelings, dumps her boyfriend, and with the help of two guys in the large Grand Central Station crowd she stops him leaving New York, he climbs over the people, and they share their first kiss. Also starring David Gulpilil as Neville Bell, Michael Lombard as Sam Charlton, Ritchie Singer as Con, Maggie Blinco as Ida, Steve Rackman as Donk, Gerry Skilton as Nugget, Terry Gill as Duffy, Peter Turnbull as Trevor and Khristina Totos as Rosita. Hogan is a likable character that doesn't have a bad bone, it is like Tarzan in a concrete jungle story as he ignores some taunts and outwits some villains. It is slightly questionable how this very simple film became so popular at the cinema, and spawned two sequels, it is a tiny bit overrated and overlooked possibly, but a fun and easy to reasonably easy to swallow comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 55 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!",Crocodile Dundee
6,ccthemovieman-1,Winning Formula Made This A Big Hit,9,2 August 2007,"When you mix good comedy with action and a very likable leading character you get a hit movie. I never met anyone who didn't like this film, although there are always detractors to any movie and no movie is perfect, either.However, this was an extremely entertaining that made an international star out of Australian Paul Hogan. Two sequels followed this movie. They were decent but could not measure up to this effort.Not only was this a big success for Hogan and everyone else connected with it, but I believe he got a wife out of this wife, going on to marry his co-star Linda Kozlowski.As someone pointed out, Hogan, as crocodile man ""Mick Dundee"" made the rest of the world aware of a number of Aussie phrases. Few men played as manly as likeabe and charismatic a hero in the 1980s as Hogan and ""Mick."" Twenty years later, this is still a fun movie to watch now and then.",Crocodile Dundee
7,Quinoa1984,One of the best treats of the 80's,8,20 April 2001,"For someone who loves to see the ridiculous and often shameful displays of comedy, it is actually pleasing for someone to view a treat such as this film.  Crocodile Dundee is a classic 80's comedy about a New York paper writer who goes to Australia to get a story, and finds it in Mick Dundee, a legend in his own area as a croc wrangler and master of the outback.  But then, she decides to show him the rest of the world- really New York, where he fits in like Janet Reno in a size 4 cat suit.There are many memorable scenes with Hogan as the Croc man, many in New York (the that's not a knife, this is a knife is fokelore at this point), though there are some others in the Outback scenes.  Also, Linda Kozlowski is one hot piece here and she is a good love interest for Hogan.  Quite the comedy. A",Crocodile Dundee

9,hitchcockthelegend,He went walkabout.,8,29 November 2009,"New York reporter Sue Charlton hears of a guy in the outback of Australia who survived an attack by a crocodile. For research she meets up with ""Crocodile Mick Dundee"" and spends time with him out in dangerous Bush Country. Finding a rapport during their time together, Sue convinces Mick to go back with her to New York, which brings interesting results as Mick becomes a big hit by treating the Big Apple, and all that comes his way, the same as he would the Outback.Crocodile Dundee has a standard fish out of water comedy premise, yet with a number of truly funny sequences and an appealing turn from Paul Hogan as Dundee, it became a monster smash hit that the cinema watching public lapped up with glee. In a decade that is often considered or debated to be the worst for film, it may just be that cinema goers were desperate for a pick me up movie? Possibly, but undoubtedly Crocodile Dundee most assuredly is that type of escapist piece. However, to give that credence would, I feel, be doing it a disservice, for in spite of the rickety concept and the obviousness of where we will ultimately end up, it has bundles of earthy charm, a charm that many can identify with.As Dundee goes about his way, meeting pimps, transsexuals and muggers et al, they are not only very funny scenes, they are also points of reference to the ever changing way of the Continents. Not that the film doesn't come dangerously close to falling into a sugary rom-com mire, but with a strong performance from Linda Kozlowski as Sue, and Hogan introducing an icon to 80s cinema, Crocodile Dundee safely hits the target that it was surely aiming for. Besides, the love story here is very easy to get on side with, to support it and hanker for this opposites attract coupling to work out.Two sequels would follow, the first one was a retread reversal and just about passable, the second one, after a gap of 13 years, was bad and evidence that the joke had long since passed. Crocodile Dundee 86 holds up well as the escapist piece of cinema that it is. A nice film to revisit every other year, for it be simple, warm, and yes, I'll say it again, damn funny. 8/10",Crocodile Dundee
10,Calicodreamin,"Aimless, but fun.",6,17 December 2019,"There really isn't much of a storyline to speak of, the plot meanders and theres no central focus. However, Hogan and Kozlowski have great chemistry, and the acting is pretty good. Hogan's undeniable charm makes for a fun watch.",Crocodile Dundee
11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Not sharp enough to be a knife, but not bad",6,5 May 2010,"""Fish out of water"" flicks weren't few and far between in the 80's, and this, intentionally or otherwise, very much defines itself as being a product of said decade; the fashion(something most who can remember it want to forget), the superficiality, and the material. This one does genuinely have a lot of funny(if primarily based on stereotypes) jokes and gags, quite a number of them surprising(and several remind us of the laughs we had before political correctness grew to its current position of immense power over our freedom of speech). The clash of cultures does go over the top at times and that we cannot relate to; and the characters really aren't developed(also a trait that can be found in other movies from the period), and the romance between the leads is pretty unconvincing. There's arguably too little consequence to many occurrences. Acting is average, though the Aussie is charming. The boyfriend is obnoxious and purely there to provide ""opposition"" to Mick's infatuation, and even that he doesn't succeed in. For how average the editing and cinematography are, this does present us with attractive footage of the great outdoors. There is some mild violence, infrequent strong language and a little sexual stuff(no nudity; however, *hot* shots of Kozlowski) and other crude bits. The DVD contains a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fan of this sort of film. 6/10",Crocodile Dundee
12,neil-476,Still fresh,8,5 April 2014,"Mick Dundee is a man's man who has lived all his life next to nature in a remote backwater in Australia. A New York journalist finds him intriguing while writing pieces about him and, after some experiences of life in the outback, prevails upon him to travel back to the USA with her.This film breaks into two parts: the Australian bit, where we learn that Mick Dundee is a man of integrity, full of knowledge and ability, and then the New York but where he is a fish out of water. The joke is that even when he is being a fish out of water, his native decency and sheer can-do-it-ness makes him more than a match for the low-lifes, idiots, and ignorant fools he encounters.Paul Hogan, playing a character he both devised and wrote, conveys Mick as the sort of bloke you would like to share a pint with and have by your side in a crisis. Linda Kozlowski, as the American journalist, has both good chemistry with Hogan (who she subsequently married) and nice buttocks.This romantic comedy was pleasing when it first came out, and remains fresh today.",Crocodile Dundee
13,evanston_dad,Why Did We Like This Movie So Much the First Time Around?,5,6 May 2008,"Paul Hogan became a minor star (o.k., a VERY minor star) as a result of this well-received comedy about a man plucked out of the middle of the Australian outback and plunked down in New York City. Cue all of the requisite fish-out-of-water jokes. Viewing the film now, one is appalled at 1.) how not very good it is and 2.) how much smaller the world must have gotten since 1986 -- this movie makes Australia seem like a country from the far side of the moon.Hogan tried to capitalize on the success of this movie and threw his hat in the ring for a sequel. Not a good idea, mate.Grade: C",Crocodile Dundee
14,Uriah43,Out of His Element in the Big City,8,3 October 2015,"After a crocodile almost bites his leg off and forces him to crawl away to safety, ""Mick Dundee"" (Paul Hogan) acquires a reputation which eventually reaches the desk of a news reporter named ""Sue Charlton"" (Linda Kozlowski) who is determined to track him down to get the details. This leads her to the outback of Australia where she not only meets him face-to-face but also has the opportunity to get several photos of where the event occurred. It's at this time that she gets the idea of having him come to New York City to finish the story from another angle. What she doesn't count on is just how much he is out of his element in the big city and the adventures he soon gets himself into. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it I will just say that this was a delightful comedy which kept my attention from the beginning to the very end. I especially liked the interaction between the two main characters who clearly enjoyed working together. In any case, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it for those who are looking for a movie of this type. I have rated it according.",Crocodile Dundee
15,FlashCallahan,Fair Dinkum'.......,7,24 December 2012,"Michael J. ""Crocodile"" Dundee is an Australian crocodile hunter who lives in the outback and runs a safari business with his trusted friend Walter. After surviving a crocodile attack, New York journalist Sue arrives to interview Mick about how he survived and to learn more about the crocodile hunter. After saving Sue from a crocodile, Sue invites Mick to visit New York City, since Mick has never been to a city. Mick finds the culture and life in New York City a lot different than his home and he finds himself falling in love with Sue.....It's your typical fish out of water comedy, for the first act, it's Sue who is the fish, but obviously, it's more exaggerated when Dundee goes to New York, as everything is exaggerated there isn't it?Liking the film is all dependent on how you warm to Hogan, and thankfully he is a great screen presence. Story wise, it's nothing, there barely is a story, other than that the two fall for each other.What we get are little scenarios where we laugh with/at Mick, when he doesn't understand what someone is saying or doing.It's not clever, but it's consistently funny, in a very eighties way.",Crocodile Dundee
16,Aaron1375,Your basic fish out of water movie.,6,10 April 2011,"This film was funny a bit, but I enjoyed it more when they were in Australia rather than when the film switched to New York which is probably why I enjoyed the second film a tad more as it does the reverse of this movie. This one also does not seem to have a real point to it, almost a film without a plot. A woman hears of a man who had a deadly encounter with a crocodile in Australia so she goes there to do a story on him and he ends up being a bit more lively than expected. He shows her some of the sights in the Outback, and she gets him to come to New York where he has some sights to see of his own. Of course, they go to New York, one of the most over filmed cities in the world, but it makes for some funny encounters, they just are not as interesting as the stuff in Australia is. Paul Hogan is good in the title role, it is to bad he really could not escape this character as the three Crocodile movies and one about him being some sort of robber/angel is like the only movies I know him from. The laughs are funny, but once they get to New York the laughs are all out of water kind of situations. Apparently, Australia is really backwoods as the poor guy has seen nothing like cross dressers and things of that nature.",Crocodile Dundee
17,Wuchakk,Likable Paul Hogan and lovely Linda Kozlowski in a FUN adventure,8,10 March 2014,"Linda Kozlowski plays a reporter who goes to the Australian Outback to do a story on Mick ""Crocodile"" Dundee, Played by Paul Hogan. She gets a good taste of Dundee's simple Tarzan-like life in the wilderness and decides to invite him to New York City. Dundee is a fish-out-of-water in the big city, of course, but it doesn't take him long to adapt, and the New Yorkers love him. Linda and Dundee naturally start to fall in love despite the fact that she has an arrogant fiancé.""Crocodile Dundee"" was released in 1986 and spawned two sequels in 1988 and 2001. It successfully combines 3 genres or themes -- romantic comedy, adventure and fish-out-of-water.What makes the film work so well is the simple charisma of Paul Hogan. You'll likely never experience a more likable protagonist. On top of this, Linda Kozlowski is both likable and lovely, possessing an attractive spirituality and intelligence.Paul and Linda have great chemistry. The chemistry is real seeing as how they would marry four years later in 1990. This is funny in light of the fact that one of Roger Ebert's main criticisms of the film was their supposed lack of chemistry. I love Roger Ebert. He's a great writer and critic, but he obviously missed it big on this one!""Crocodile Dundee"" was the most successful Australian film ever. It only runs about 90 minutes before the credits start. This is great because romantic comedies like ""Dundee"" are light fare; there's simply no reason to go much longer than an hour and a half. In other words, ""Dundee"" doesn't overstay its welcome.GRADE: A-",Crocodile Dundee
18,SimonJack,Comedy and light adventure Down Under,7,15 November 2018,"Paul Hogan became known over night as an actor with the release of this box office smash hit. ""Crocodile Dundee"" introduced many movie fans to Australia, especially its Outback. This wasn't the first major film about Australia that reached theaters in the Americas and Europe. But it was the first big box office hit everywhere.""The Sundowners"" of 1960 starred Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr. While it did all right in the United Kingdom and was the third highest grossing film in Australia in 1961, it flopped in the U.S. That was due mostly to poor marketing and scant theater releases. Yet, it received five Academy Award nominations.""Crocodile Dundee"" once again sparked interest in Australia among the movie crowds. Other films were soon to follow. Some had big name stars doing films Down Under. Tom Selleck starred in ""Quigley Down Under"" in 1990. Hogan and the cast of ""Crocodile"" made sequels that were shot partly in Australia. ""Crocodile Dundee II"" came out in 1988 and ""Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles"" hit the screen in 2001. ""The Rabbit-Proof Fence"" of 2002 had a mostly unknown Australian cast but was a critical success, if not a huge box-office success. The most recent smash film from Down Under is the epic movie, ""Australia"" of 2008. It starred Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman. There have been many others since and in between.This is a feel good comedy and adventure film. Hogan also helped write and produce the movie, and was nominated for an Oscar for the writing. He did receive the 1987 Golden Globe for best actor for this film. And, he received two BAFTA nominations, for acting and writing. Hogan was not a total newcomer to film. Before this, he was one of the leads in the smash Australian TV mini-series about World War I, ""Anzacs.""This was also Linda Kozlowski's first silver screen role, as Sue Charlton. And, native Australian actor John Meillon plays Walter Reilly, a sidekick and sometime manager for Crocodile.This is a light comedy with some good scenery from Australia that most movie fans should enjoy.",Crocodile Dundee

20,ShadeGrenade,"""You can live on it...but it tastes like s--t!""",9,27 April 2010,"It seems like only yesterday. Thatcher was in 10, Downing Street, Reagan in The White House, 'Dallas' and 'Miami Vice' were the biggest programmes on television, and the film everyone was talking about was Paul Faiman's 'Crocodile Dundee'. At my local Odeon the queue stretched right round the block. Nothing like it had been seen since 'Grease' ( 1978 ). Its star/writer/creator was Paul Hogan, who came to the attention of British television viewers when his Australian sketch show was bought by the fledgling Channel 4 network. On top of that, his Fosters lager adverts proved popular, particularly the one where he attends a ballet and does a double-take when a Nureyev-like dancer twirls onto the stage: ""Strewth! Bloke's got no strides on!"".As was the case with 'Monty Python & The Holy Grail', backing for 'Dundee' came from various sources, but the investments paid off. It was the second biggest money-maker in the U.S. that year ( the first being the awful 'Top Gun' ), beating out 'Platoon', 'Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home', and 'Aliens'.So what was it all about? Divorced journalist Sue Charlton ( Linda Koslowski ) travels to Australia to meet the survivor of a crocodile attack. In the outback, she finds eccentric crocodile poacher Michael J. ""Crocodile"" Dundee ( Hogan ). After spending some time with him, and being impressed by his personality, she takes him back to New York. The first forty minutes are good fun, but when it moves to the Big Apple the film really gets into its comedic stride, as Mick struggles to come to terms with American culture. He washes his socks in the hotel bath, chats to a stranger in the street as though he is an old friend, and, when a mugger tries to rob him at knife point, whips out his blade, and grins: ""That's a knife!"", causing the terrified man to flee.Suddenly a new folk hero was born. America had 'Superman', Britain had 'James Bond', and Australia now had 'Crocodile Dundee'. Hogan was ruggedly good-looking, and quick-witted. Audiences the world over were charmed by his laid-back manner. Unfortunately, they never accepted the actor in any other role.He attributed the picture's success to the love story at its heart. I think Linda Koslowski has not had enough credit for her contribution to the film; not only is she sexy, but intelligent and funny ( and looks great in a thong! ). The romance spilt over into real life for the stars.One person who could not have been pleased with the film's success was Barry Humphries, whose 1971 comedy 'The Adventures Of Barry McKenzie' ( starring Barry Crocker ) also concerned an Australian man let loose in a foreign country. The films are very different. 'Dundee' is heart warming and its characters warm and likable, 'McKenzie' on the other hand is raucous ( lots of vomiting and urinating ) and rude. I like both films for different reasons.Oscar nominated for Best Screenplay, Hogan attended the 1987 ceremony in his 'Dundee' clothes. Two years later, a sequel came out - 'Crocodile Dundee 2'. It did not do the big business of the first ( I thought personally it was superior ) but proved popular all the same. Alas Hogan waited until 2001 to make a third picture - 'Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles'. Audiences yawned.Twenty-five years later, the original film stands the test of time as a delightful, crowd-pleasing comedy.",Crocodile Dundee
21,JamesHitchcock,The First Great Australian Comedy,9,1 March 2005,"The Australian film industry first began to come to international notice in the seventies and early eighties with films like Peter Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" and ""Gallipoli"", Fred Schepisi's ""The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith"" and Bruce Beresford's ""Breaker Morant"". Most of these were films with a serious theme and, often, a historical setting. ""Crocodile Dundee"" was different. Not only did it have a contemporary setting, it was also perhaps the first great Australian comedy- certainly the first Australian comedy to achieve international success.The protagonists are Mick Dundee, a bushman from northern Australia, and Sue Charleton, an attractive young female journalist from New York. Sue is on assignment in Australia, and hears stories about a legendary crocodile hunter from the small outback village of Walkabout Creek. (The name may be homage to Nicolas Roeg's film ""Walkabout"", one of the earliest manifestations of the Australian New Wave. One of the stars of that film, David Gumpilil, has a part in Crocodile Dundee). Sue meets Mick to interview him and travels with him into the bush to see the scene of his famed encounter with a crocodile that nearly cost him his leg. She then arranges for him to travel back to New York with her- the first time he has been outside Australia or visited a city.The film is essentially a romantic comedy. Romantic comedies generally deal with a couple in love and the way in which they overcome obstacles to their love. A common type of obstacle is a discrepancy in their social backgrounds, and this is the type we have here. Sue and Mick seem to be polar opposites. She is a typical product of the American East Coast elite- urban, wealthy, professional, politically committed to liberal causes. He is from a working-class background, rural, apolitical with no fixed employment. As another reviewer has pointed out, he is as much a fish out of water in the city as she is in the outback. To make things worse, he is considerably older than her, and she already has a boyfriend, her editor Richard. There is, however, a saying that polar opposites attract, and this is as true of characters in romantic comedies as it is of magnets. The marvellous ending on the crowded subway station is one of the most memorable finales to any romantic comedy, rivalling that of ""The Graduate"". Some romantic comedies concentrate on romance at the expense of comedy, but Crocodile Dundee is not one of them. The film is brilliantly funny, especially in the second half when the action moves to New York. The main source of the humour is Paul Hogan's title character. Mick is a rough diamond, but decent, kindly and good-hearted. Most of the laughs arise from his innocent misunderstanding of the seedier aspects of life in the big city- there are jokes at the expense of prostitutes, criminals like the muggers who flee when they see Mick has a bigger knife than they have (""That's not a knife. THAT'S a knife!""), transvestites (one of whom Mick mistakenly tries to chat up), drug takers (Mick thinks cocaine is a cure for blocked sinuses) and psychiatrists (""Haven't you got any mates to talk to?"") This last sentiment touched a chord in Britain, ever suspicious of the American obsession with psycho-analysis. Mick may be apolitical, but he is also politically incorrect- much of the humour is aimed at the culture of political correctness, just starting to burgeon in the mid-eighties. There are jokes about race and gender, and Dundee is not only a drinker but also a heavy smoker. (And this during a decade when smoking was almost banished from the screen).Some of the humour is perhaps a bit exaggerated- it is, for example, difficult to believe that Mick does not recognise the prostitutes for what they are, as he is no sexual innocent but a red-blooded ladies' man with an eye for the Sheilas- but this is deliberate exaggeration for satirical effect. The film both satirises and celebrates Australia's self-image as a land of self-reliant pioneers from the outback- most modern Australians, in fact, live in the suburbs of a few large cities- by contrasting idealised rural Australian values with the supposed vices of urban America.Despite the great success of this film, the sequel was less successful and Paul Hogan and his lovely co-star Linda Kozlowski (who later became his wife) did not perhaps go on to the glittering careers that some had predicted for them. Nevertheless, Mick Dundee will live on as one of the great comic characters of all time, and the film itself as one of the best comedies of the eighties and possibly the best Australian comedy ever. 9/10",Crocodile Dundee
22,Red-Barracuda,Warm-hearted Aussie rom-com,7,27 December 2009,"A NY journalist travels to the Australian Outback to write a feature on a famed bushman. She ends up taking him back to NYC to round off her article. All the while these two opposites develop an attraction to one and other.Crocodile Dundee is a textbook fish out of water film. The romantic sub-plot is predictable and the general jist of the humour is as you would expect. But the movie really works primarily because of Paul Hogan's turn as the title character. He is very convincing - too convincing perhaps as he has been typecast ever since. He captures Mick Dundee's confidence at home in Aus, as well as his naivety in New York. And as this latter factor is the basis for most of the comedy, it's the strongest section of the film. There are numerous funny encounters with various New York denizens. And while it's not exactly a hilarious movie, it's certainly a likeably humorous one.Whatever you do though, watch out for the edited pre-watershed TV version of this film that seems to be broadcast regularly. It's missing loads of the humour. The cocaine scene has been entirely removed as well as half-a-dozen of the funniest lines that have been deemed as being too risqué. It's annoying, so beware. Try and catch the original movie free of this silly interference.",Crocodile Dundee
23,OllieSuave-007,Good ''80s style comedy from down under.,8,22 June 2014,"This is a good 1980s comedy from down under, where American reporter Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) goes to Australia to meet and interview crocodile poacher Michael ""Crocodile"" Dundee (Paul Hogan) and invites him to New York City, where their cultures clash. The movie is charming and innocently funny as we see Dundee adapt to life in the city. The chemistry with Sue is a very nice touch of romance and blends in well with the comedy. The plot has a good momentum to it; therefore, it is pretty entertaining from start to finish and, like many of the '80s comedies, is one of its kind that has no over-the-top stuff - just adventurous, charming fun.Grade B",Crocodile Dundee
24,sddavis63,Two Fish Out Of Water Stories In One,7,4 November 2002,"A wonderfully (although not outrageously) humourous story about a crocodile fighting Australian outbacker who ends up travelling to New York for a series of adventures and misadventures.Paul Hogan plays the title role of Michael J. ""Mick"" or ""Crocodile"" Dundee, and nails the role to perfection - as he should, given that he was also responsible for developing and writing the story. Linda Kozlowski plays Sue Charlton, the American newspaper writer assigned to write a feature story about this mysterious man from down under. The story begins in Australia, where Charlton is the one out of her element, dependent on Dundee to overcome the dangers often encountered. She also becomes his voice of conscience, however, pushing him to take action, for example, against kangaroo poachers. It's in Australia where we also see one of the more disappointing parts of the movie, however - disappointing because it was unnecessary. I'm referring to the shot of Kozlowski in what I thought was an unlikely choice of bathing suit to wear under her clothes in such conditions. I'm not against a shot of an attractive woman when it serves to move the story along. This one simply didn't do that. Anyone ever heard the word ""exploitation?""Moving to New York City, we now see Dundee as the fish out of water, adjusting (somewhat better, I would say, than Sue did in the outback) to life in the big city. Dundee takes on pimps, prostitutes, transvestites and muggers  - and always manages to come out on top. The American scenes, I thought, were by far the funnier. All in all, it's an enjoyable couple of hours to spend, although (ironically, since Hogan and Kozlowski later married in real life) the romance between Mick and Sue just didn't strike me as ""real."" A certain chemistry seemed to be lacking between them. Still, there are a lot of good laughs here. 7/10",Crocodile Dundee
25,ElMaruecan82,Mick Dundee or the down-to-earth guy from Down Under ..,8,7 November 2012,"""I'm always all right when I'm with you, Dundee. God, that sounds corny (after a pause) Why do you make me feel like Jane in a Tarzan comic?"" This is Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) relieved when Mick Dundee (Paul Hogan) got rid of three thugs after showing them what a real knife is. The line stops being corny when she admits it and unveils a subtle intelligence within the story, as if by comparing the hero to a movie icon, it makes him ordinary within the film, while indirectly establishing his extraordinary status as a movie character. I read that ""Crocodile Dundee"" was a surprise hit at the time of its release, being the second highest-grossing film of 1986 after ""Top Gun"". Actually, I'm more surprised that critics were surprised because ""Crocodile Dundee"" is precisely the kind of creations that made the 80's such a great decade on the field of fun, sheer escapism and movie heroes. And Dundee is as cool, brave, macho and bad-ass as Indiana Jones, Conan or Rambo, but for a change, he doesn't kill people, and he's far more sympathetic and likable than any of them. I say 'likable' because there must be a reason why a film with no stars and made by an unknown director would meet such a big success. Apart from word of mouth, I can't figure.Although the word is hackneyed, the crocodile hunter is as iconic as Indiana Jones himself, immediately recognizable from his black hat with gator teeth, his vest, his brown leather jacket, his Aussie accent and a hidden scratch in his leg he cutely calls a 'love bite'. The 'love bite' has been exaggerated into a bitten-off leg on its way to New York, but it decided Sue Charlton to go to Australia and interview the mysterious legend, a legend even more embellished by Mick's friend Walter. In a pub, Dundee makes a spectacular entrance and reveals beneath his toughness a very down-to-earth personality and an irresistible sense of humor. Creating an unforgettable character is not an easy task, yet ""Crocodile Dundee"" does and that's a credit to Paul Hogan's fine performance, rightfully earning him the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Comedy.Linda Kozlowski was also nominated as she plays her part perfectly. She's the audience that is invited to discover Mick's world with the nosiness and curiosity we expect from a female journalist (that's Dundee talking). And the exchanges between Mick and Sue reveal a subtler writing than in any other comedy or romance, when she mentions that the Aborigines own the land, you could tell it's an overly reverent statement but Mick corrects her immediately: ""arguing over who owns them is like two fleas arguing over who owns the dog they live on."", no room from predictable lines: Mick's age? The last time he asked when he was born, the Aborigine who raised him said ""in summertime"". When Walter informs them he'll be back in Wednesday, Mick nods but after a pause, has to ask what today is. As Walter comments ""Doesn't know. Doesn't care.""And during the two-night trip, Sue, the 'sheila' discovers this world where the notion of time and property cease to exist. Whatever 'sheila' means: woman or foreigner, she's clearly an outsider and the script tactfully avoids the cliché of the feminist urban female, Kowzlowki plays her character very naturally, she doesn't get offended by Dundee's macho comments, she knows where her place is and she doesn't even save Mick or flirt with danger to prove something. This is crucial because it also helps to create a natural bonding process with a realism that is almost equal to Meryl Streep and Robert Redford in ""Out of Africa"". And the film uses humor as the perfect language to highlight the growing complicity. For example, he cooks her some snakes and disgusting animals, she tries to eat them while he casually opens a corned-beef can. Humor is not just granted because it's a comedy; it's a real side of Mick's personality and his most endearing charm. And it is pivotal for the plot because it leads to what everybody expects: the invitation. This is when ""Crocodile Dundee"" works like the missing link between Harrison Ford in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and Eddie Murphy in ""Coming to America"", a film it probably inspired. Dundee is still exotic enough to feel like a fish out the water when he's ""coming to America"" and provide a funny view of New York City from a foreigner's perspective, pinnacling with the famous 'knife' scene. It probably deals with more formulaic situations than the first act. We're not that thrilled by Linda's pompous fiancé, who naturally is totally different from Mick, but it's Mick Dundee we follow with an interested eye, evolving in an urban jungle full of prostitutes, junkies, and transvestites. The film doesn't sugarcoat the reality (hence the unforgettable shot on Sue's swimsuit) but it's faithful to Dundee's adventurous and friendly nature. I doubt he would have enjoyed staying in the hotel and watch ""I Love Lucy"". The formula of the second act is redeemed by the way it's handled until the unforgettable climactic scene. But what the film succeeds is to create a defining character of the 80's, a sympathetic macho icon who, for once, doesn't kill and doesn't take himself seriously, and a great script, rightfully Oscar-nominated. I know I mentioned the script several times, but that's because many directors would take the premise for granted and forget about the writing. The French tried to make their version through the infamous ""Little Indian, Big City"" and although a commercial success, the film was a disaster. The story was going from archetypal situations to convenient resolutions with no heart, no wit, no characterization, no charm whatsoever.One must endure this horrific film to realize why ""Crocodile Dundee"" is so great, believe me, mate!",Crocodile Dundee
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Outdated in pretty much every way.,5,11 November 2018,"'Crocodile Dundee (1986)' is outdated in pretty much every possible way, not only relying on broad stereotypes and genre clichés but also being pretty sexist, a tad racist, fairly homophobic and oh-so transphobic, to boot. It's also just generally quite dull, relying on a strange two-half structure that sees the flick undergo a severe shift in perspective, though this shift does thankfully kick things into gear somewhat. Its segmented approach means that we don't really get a chance to connect with either of the main characters, since the foundation laid in the first section has us view Dundee from an outside perspective and, thus, isn't built upon in the second when the flick effectively hits the 'reset' button and we're placed firmly within his head-space (despite never really getting an insight into his mind). The little plot that there is doesn't really do anything interesting, either, since the conflict essentially boils down to a 'fish out of water' that can breathe just fine, with our infallible hero simply encountering strange situations which he always escapes unscathed while also making nothing but good impressions on the locals and furthering his 'cool', 'exotic', 'hyper-masculine' persona. It's this persona which lands him a half-baked romance with a woman already in a relationship, one willing to throw her life away for a man who doesn't seem to care, has already expressed several disconcertingly sexist views and will surely, as he did with his last long-standing partner, 'walkabout' without her for a couple of years while he expects her to wait, ever ready with the dinner when he gets back (though, maybe not, if the two - yes two - sequels are anything to go by). 5/10",Crocodile Dundee

Well, he did get his own movie eventually, I believe. This movie is a really relaxing one. That might not be the biggest compliment. The story's pretty simple, with a woman going to Australia to find the legendary Crocodile Dundee and then him going back with her to New York City. What's so cute is that half of this movie takes place in Australia and the other half in the United States. I just thought this was a very organized and subtle way to handle the story. It helps that the Crocodile Dundee is so likeable. I admit it could have been funnier and it does get clichéd at the end. Still, it's a very pleasant little film.

29,slightlymad22,Not As Good As I Remember,7,12 January 2015,"I loved this movie back in the 1980's and having not seen it in over twenty five years, when I realised SkyMovies were showing this, and Crocodile Dundee 2 back to back, I decided to revisit my youth and watch them. Sadly this first movie did not live up to the fond memories in my mind. I'd have rated this as an 8, if I was reviewing it without rewatching it, however now it is not the case.Plot In A Paragraph: Sue Charlton, a New York reporter (Linda Kozlowski) is working on assignment in Australia, when she heads to the outback to interview the living legend Mike Dundee (Paul Hogan). When she finally locates him, she is so taken with him that she brings him back with her to New York. In New York, Mike Dundee is amazed by the wonders of the city and the interesting people there.Paul Hogans performance is full of charm and I still find him an engaging lead as Mick ""Crocodile"" Dundee, but overall the movie was a letdown from what I remembered. Linda Kozlowski was the high point of the movie for this reviewer. She is gorgeous, talented, had great chemistry with Hogan (who she would later marry) and boy what an ass!! The scene where she is in the thong bikini is what has lingered in my memory, even though I didn't remember it from all those years ago. Reginald VelJohnson is a lot of fun as Gus the Limo driver. Mark Blum is simply perfectly slimy as Richard Mason, Sue's fiancée. I'll still watch the second movie now (I'm writing this during the ad break) but I remember it not being up to the standard of this one. I'll still vote it a generous 7/10. It would have been a 6/10 but I'm awarding a bonus point for Kozlowski's ass in THAT thong bikini.",Crocodile Dundee

And quite honestly, I believe it would never have worked so well if it wasn't for the charmingly funny - and dare I say devilishly handsome - Paul Hogan!Mick Dundee (Paul Hogan) has such an endearing mannerism that you can't help but love him. His simple existence and naïve nature makes him incredibly sexy, and funny - being naturally funny as opposed to slapstick. I just love him!The film features very good cinematography. We follow Mick 'Crocodile' Dundee and a reporter, Sue, on an adventure to relive the moment he was allegedly attacked by a giant crocodile, and managed to killed the crocodile. Well, so the legend goes. Whether or not it is actually true, is never revealed, but the journey makes for one hell of an exciting and funny adventure. It's so hard to find these great adventure comedies nowadays.The romance interest was predictable, but it felt sincere and was rather beautiful, actually.

32,zkonedog,Iconic Character; Movie Itself Lacking A Solid Audience Base,6,26 June 2017,"There is no doubt that Crocodile Dundee became an iconic film character because of this film. The phrase ""that's not a knifethis is a knife!"" (along with a few others) are oft-quoted, and if the movie didn't invent the ""country bumpkin comes to the big city"" trope, it elevated it to new cinematic heights. That alone is enough to make ""Crocodile Dundee"" entertaining. Holding the experience back from being an all-time classic, though, is the fact that the film itself really lacks a strong or defined audience base.For a basic plot summary, the film sees journalist Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) on an assignment in Australia, tracking down the infamous Mick ""Crocodile"" Dundee (Paul Hogan) for a story. After meeting Mick and living in his world (i.e. ""the bush"") for a little while, Sue becomes smitten with him (in more ways than way). She takes him back to New York City with her, ostensibly to continue her broadening story, but also because he is ever more exciting than her stodgy, socialite fiancée Richard (Mark Blum).The main reason I can give this film as many as six stars is because Hogan's Dundee is goofball humor at its very finest! As a child, I considered it the peak of hilarity, and even as an adult there is something endearing about it. Perhaps the movie, on a deeper level, speaks to the dichotomy between our natural, survival instincts, in comparison to those that must be cultivated for city life. Simply put, it will make you laugh on a number of occasions.Unfortunately, I really can't think of a specific audience for ""Crocodile Dundee"", and that is why I think it is fading away a bit as time goes by. In all honesty, the humor in the film is rather childish, lending itself to youngsters. At the same time, however, there are some instances/scenes (especially in NYC) that clearly are not made for children. On the other end of the spectrum, there are deep, interesting ""city vs. wild"" themes in the film for adults, but again the humor is so childish as to render any length of seriousness rather moot.So, I think that the endearing legacy of ""Crocodile Dundee"" will be the iconic title-named character created by Paul Hogan. If looked strictly through that lens, the film is quite entertaining. Trying to evaluate the film as a whole, however, will produce mostly disappointment (in large part because of a lack of defined audience). If you haven't seen this movie, it is worth watching just to ""get"" the iconic references. Upon a recent re-watch, I discovered that ""child me"" held it in higher regard than ""adult me"".",Crocodile Dundee

It's difficult to argue with the most popular film of the season, even when co-writer Hogan exposes a callous attitude toward his audience by showing, in the final scene, a crowd of happy subway commuters all too willing to offer their heads for him to step on in order to be reunited with his lover.

42,PredragReviews,Fair dinkum'....,8,6 April 2017,"Crocodile Dundee has a standard fish out of water comedy premise, yet with a number of truly funny sequences and an appealing turn from Paul Hogan as Dundee; it became a monster smash hit that the cinema watching public lapped up with glee. In a decade that is often considered to be the worst for film, it may just be that cinema goers were desperate for a pick me up movie? Something that Crocodile Dundee most assuredly is. But to give that credence would, I feel, be doing it a disservice, for in spite of the rickety concept and the obviousness of where we will ultimately end up, it has bundles of earthy charm, a charm that many can identify with.As Dundee goes about his way, meeting pimps, transsexuals and muggers etc , they are not only very funny scenes, they are also points of reference to the ever changing way of the Continents. The film does come dangerously close to falling into a sugary rom-com mire, but with a strong performance from Linda Kozlowski as Sue, and Hogan introducing an icon to 80s cinema, Crocodile Dundee safely hits the target that it was surely aiming for. Besides, the love story here is very easy to get on side with.The film quite naturally, divides into two parts. The first in Australia, has a surprising depth to it and a real feel for the place(the Outback)and its people and of course you get to know the characters. The second part of the film is set in New York and provides the bulk of the humour but still remains character focused and never descends into pointless gag-making.

Crowd-pleasing fluff was a runaway box office hit, and has an easy-going charm to it even during the dry spots and when it gets aggressively corny (the ending generates smiles and groans in equal measure). Hogan's amiable charisma carries the day, strutting his stuff on his home turf and then getting into a series of skewed, tongue-in-cheek encounters in NYC with pimps, muggers, transvestites, coke-heads and the like. As Dundee's business partner, Meillon exhibits a wry but genteel appeal as well. Surprisingly, although they would eventually marry in real life, the stars only have minimal romantic chemistry together. Peter Best provides the fine music score. The American release inserted quotation marks around the word ""crocodile"" in the title to make sure audiences knew it wasn't about an actual reptile(!); to be fair, with his flashing teeth and leathery skin, it's not too hard to mistake Hogan for a saltwater snapper.64/100",Crocodile Dundee

Add to that the chance for foreigners to see some gorgeous Antipodean locations as well, and you have the potential for a big hit, which is exactly what this film became.Paul Hogan may be almost as scaly as the creatures he's supposed to tangle with, but he does possess an undeniable charm, which is tapped to perfection here. Mick's adventures are certainly predictable, but they're tremendous fun if viewed through wide eyes, so grab a cold drink of your choice and settle down. Ripper!

49,dunmore_ego,From Barbecued Shrimps to New York Pimps and Boyfriend Wimps.,7,21 May 2006,"Having grown up in Australia, I knew of Paul Hogan since the mid '70s. A regular face on Australian TV with his hilarious *Paul Hogan Show,* he was the paragon of the ocker Everyman. (""Ocker"" is an Australian of low social caste, revealed through their broad accent and over-use of Aussie slang  a near analogue of America's trailer park contingent.)These days, Paul Hogan is a god.I didn't know Hogan personally, although in 1991, I performed a few rock gigs with his eldest son, Clay - an apple who fell far from the tree. Not talent-wise, but industry-wise. In 2006, Hogan seems to have joined his son in that meadow, slowly rotting far from the industry's fickle tree. But in a fluke of good timing back in 1986, Hogan's weathered, masculine tracker character from the Australian outback happened to be the perfect foil to New York's 80s hairstyles, yuppie consumerism and disco sensibilities.From a story by Hogan, John Cornell and Ken Shadie, and helmed by mustered Australian television director, Peter Faiman, *Crocodile Dundee* not only put Hogan on the world stage  it put Australia there too. *Dundee* captured the earthy, textured Australia that lent a ""heritage"" aspect to that juvenile backwater, and was largely responsible for the misperception of the ""hardened Aussie"" in subsequent Fosters beer ads. Though merely a modern, laconic retelling of the noble savage tale, the movie is refreshing enough in its simplicity and sincerity to garner itself a little shelf life in the Tarzan pantheon. American audiences were ready to embrace the blond, blue-eyed, rugged, crocodile hunter after Hogan kicked Australian tourism up ten notches with his spurious offer to ""put another shrimp on the Barbie."" Even though there was no such thingY'see, Australians call shrimp ""prawns."" And no one  but NO ONE  *ever* included prawns in their barbecue menus. Take my word. I'm Australian. At the million or so barbecues I attended whilst growing up Downunda, barbecuists were known to put various foodstuffs on the ""barbie"" - sausages  yes; t-bones  yes; chicken, hamburgers, franks, buns, onions, fish, potatoes, tomatoes, chops  but no shrimp. It was a fantasy created by American marketers. But, much like *The Godfather* influenced the vernacular and lifestyles of real mobsters, so too has that ""shrimp"" fiction become reality, in the States and Australia alike. To the point where I almost feel like *I'm* the one who is lying about the historical non-existence of this cuisineOnward. *Crocodile Dundee* finds Hogan as the somewhat mythical eponymous character, Michael J. ""Crocodile"" Dundee, infamous for his wild croc encounters. Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski), an American newspaper reporter on assignment in Australia, chases him down in a Northern Territory backwater, Walkabout Creek, spending three sensually-charged days in the bush with him (ostensibly to recount his tall tales for her column), then packs him off to New York with her, on the pretense of wrapping the tale Stateside, but more truthfully drawn to the masculinity which her effete American fiancé cannot provide.Throughout the movie, Dundee is a surprising blend of legitimacy (hypnotizing animals, a crack shot) and fakery (pretending to shave with his knife or tell the time by the sun's position); a fascinating mix of innocence (""What's today, Wal?""), philosophy (""Aborigines don't own the land  they belong to it""), and machismo (with a heroic crocodile kill that saves Sue's life). The New York segment is, ultimately, where the fish-out-of-water absurdities are just waiting to happen. Nothing new here, as the film takes on a decidedly 80's plastic flavor, with Dundee encountering bidets, jealous boyfriends and jive talk, drag queens, muggers and pimps. Oh my.It's always nostalgic for me to hear the song ""Live It Up"" during the suburban party scene. Though performed by average Australian band Mental As Anything, due to never hearing it outside Australian shores, it has become somewhat of a poignant memory. The other party song, ""Different World,"" was performed by another obscure Australian band - INXS.During the Australian segment, Peter Best's soundtrack evokes Aboriginal otherworldliness by employing simple flute and guitar lines, Aboriginal clicking sticks and didgeridoo pulses. His main theme is brilliantly based on a one-note jogging pulse, tribal and sensual, like a heartbeat of the living earth.The cheesy romantic climax sees Woman Running Through Streets and Public Avowal Of Love clichés. Tempering this silliness is Best's one-note pulse, at first subliminal, sustaining and growing over five minutes, throbbing at our temples in driving urgency, and at the movie's final shot is like a throat-gurgling orgasm of sound, holding up the finale with its power, cutting through the cliché.Now that's a knife!(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",Crocodile Dundee

It's a great piece of light entertainment that gets the balance of adventure and comedy spot on.Paul Hogan had the ability to make or break this film as the title character, but thankfully he thrives in the role and is responsible for almost all of the gags and funny scenes in the movie.The film plays to its strengths, taking advantage of some common stereotypes for some very funny jokes. It has charm and charisma in abundance and is a real crowd-pleaser. It's also unlikely to ever grow old due to its uniqueness and quirky humour.

52,mentalcritic,Paul Hogan's shot at the big time works for one reason,6,27 December 2004,"In the mid-1980s, Paul Hogan was still riding a peak of popularity that never really dwindled until he began trying to develop characters more palatable to audiences outside of Australia. Which is a shame, really, given that films such as Lightning Jack are far more interesting than the million retellings of the Wyatt Earp legend, simply because it didn't take itself so seriously. However, after the best part of a decade spent entertaining his countrymen on television, Paul Hogan was ready to hit the big time with a feature film. His feature film struck quite a chord with the local audience, in spite of being simplistic to the bone.Crocodile Dundee relates the simple story of a hunter living in the most remote part of Australia. The story received by one American journalist, prompting her to come and see the man herself, turns out to be slightly exaggerated, but everything else about the man seems more fairytale than real. We are treated to some brief sequences showing how Dundee copes with situations that, while seeming extraordinary to the American journalist, are mundane to him. The sequence with the Kangaroo and the poachers is a classic, and there's even a clever cameo from Ernie Dingo.About a third of the way into the film, we get an abrupt change of gears, and the action shifts to New York. The premise being to put the straightest shooter into a facade-riddled place, and seeing how he copes with the change. Unfortunately, there are times when it goes a little too far, and simple common sense regarding social interaction winds up going out the door. Sure, the joke is a little funny, but it cheapens the character quite badly.Thankfully, the film recovers when Dundee, the character, gets more in tune with his environment. In particular, the infamous ""that's not a knife"" scene shows a canniness about the way the world works that we would have to wait another couple of sequels to see again. The comedy here is very stereotypical, but it has a pure heart about it, so it works. Hogan himself was on Australian television recently, introducing a compilation of his old shows, a speech in which he stated how much better the world was before political correctness. When we see a comedy in which an aborigine makes comedy out of the old ""please don't take my photo"" bit, or the New Yorker likens a white Australian to Tarzan, we can only nod in agreement.If there is one problem with the film, and it is a small one, it is that the characters aren't really developed to any real degree. They seem more like puppets in a sketch, mainly made to recite a series of predetermined actions in the hope it will produce a laugh. Experiments in computing along these lines were begun around the time this film was being made, and the limitations became apparent in a hurry. Once the surface has been scratched, there is not a lot else to get out of Crocodile Dundee.In all, I gave Crocodile Dundee a six out of ten. When you cannot predict what will happen next, it is a lot of fun. When you can predict what will happen next, the laughs dry up. Still, Hogan isn't taking himself too seriously here, and that's what makes all the difference.",Crocodile Dundee
53,jhclues,"The Film that Put ""Down Under"" on Top (10/10)",10,17 September 2002,"One of the great things about movies is that every once in awhile the unexpected happens, something comes along that you know immediately is just a bit different and special somehow.  Usually it's the film itself, but on occasion-- and this is one of them-- a character will emerge who is not just a character in a movie, but IS the movie.  Here, it's the title character of `Crocodile Dundee,' directed by Peter Faiman, and starring Paul Hogan as the inimitable Mick Dundee, a rather unique individual hailing from the small hamlet of Walkabout Creek, Australia.  Mick hit the big screen in 1986, and from the first moment he appeared, right up through the end of the second sequel, it's been a `G'day' for audiences around the world.In Australia on assignment for her New York newspaper, journalist Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) runs across a story she just has to pursue.  It's about a legendary `local' from one of the small towns on the cusp of the bush, a crocodile hunter who, the story goes, had his leg bitten off by a croc, then managed to survive by crawling, alone, for days on end across the outback.  So it's off to the town of Walkabout Creek in search of this larger-than-life character, who it turns out is quite a `character' to say the least.  He is, in fact, one of a kind.  After a memorable meeting in the town's only pub (one of about four buildings in the whole place), Michael J. `Mick' Dundee agrees to take her on a tour retracing his steps and reconstructing the famous event where it actually took place.  He promises a hard journey through some rugged terrain-- no place, in fact, for a `Sheila'-- but, like any good reporter, she's ready for anything; or so she thinks.  And it's the beginning of an adventure she, as well as the audience, will never forget.Hogan concocted the story and created the character, then wrote the screenplay along with John Cornell and Ken Shadie, after which he turned it over to director Faiman, who did a worthy, if not exceptional, job of translating Hogan's vision to the screen.  Faiman, however, is destined to be the forgotten man with regards to this project, inasmuch as he was not only necessarily overshadowed by writer/star Hogan, but he presented the film in a fairly straightforward manner, without anything particularly noteworthy that `he' did that would put his `signature' on it.  Add to that the fact that this was the first of only two films Faiman ever directed (his second was the lackluster `Dutch' in 1991); simply not enough to reference him, nothing added to his resume afterwards to make you take notice and say, `Oh, yes, he directed Dundee,' too.'  Still, filmmaking is inherently a collaborative medium, and as they say, a film does not `direct' itself; so credit must be given where it is due, and considering how good this film is, and how well it did at the box office, it points up that whatever Faiman did, he did right.  And he deserves to be acknowledged for it.It's no secret, of course, what really makes this film work.  Aside from the engaging story with it's romantic notions of adventure, from beginning to end it has the four `Big Cs' going for it:  Character, Charisma, Chemistry and Charm.  Let's face it, Paul Hogan is `The Man' as Mick Dundee; he's the guy other guys admire and want to be (whether or not they'll admit to it), and he has the kind of natural good looks, charisma and charm that is irresistible to the ladies (whether or not they'll admit to it).  And the chemistry between Hogan and Kozlowski is irrefutable; it's the kind that makes you want to put another shrimp on the barbie.  Besides all of which there is an innate honesty about Hogan's Mick that shines through like a 1st order Fresnel light in a London fog.  He's laid-back and grounded, with a refreshingly logical outlook on life-- this guy's never going to need a pill for hypertension-- and what adds even more to his appeal is that there's a touch of larceny in his make-up, hiding just beneath that twinkle in his eye and his obvious integrity.  You also know instinctively that this is the guy you want in your corner when the chips are down.  All of this and more is what Paul Hogan captures in his performance; this is the Mick `Crocodile' Dundee he brings to the screen.In her motion picture debut, the lovely Linda Kozlowski brings some sizzle to the screen and proves to be the perfect counterpoint to co-star Hogan. Something of an `Ibsenesque' role model, she demonstrates that a woman can be strong and ultra feminine, capable yet vulnerable, and all at the same time.  It makes her portrayal of Sue Charlton convincing, well rounded and real; much more than just a cardboard cutout kind of a character that could have been used as nothing more than a vehicle to move the story along. Instead, though this is without question Mick Dundee's story, she makes it her story, too, and it gives the film an added perspective and considerably more depth than what is usually found in light comedy, which is essentially what this film is.  And there's a look in her eye and something in the way she smiles at Mick that has an absolute ring of truth to it.  You could say, in fact, that Hogan and Kozlowski are the Bogie and Bacall of the outback.Another invaluable asset to the film is the performance of the likable John Meillon as Mick's friend, Walter Reilly.  The part is a true character actor's character, and Meillon does it beautifully.  The supporting cast includes Mark Blum (Richard), Michael Lombard (Sam), Steve Rackman (Donk) and Reginald VelJohnson (Gus).  A memorable film filled with unforgettable characters, `Crocodile Dundee' will take you to the top o'the world... `down under.'  10/10.",Crocodile Dundee
54,phubbs,'Crocodile' Dundee,8,10 August 2014,"Like its star Paul Hogan this film was once big, real big, a force to be reckoned with, but has since completely disappeared into obscurity. There was a time when the slender blonde leather faced Hogan was everywhere here in the UK, mainly advertising beer and acting the gruff Aussie, it was very popular.I think what is so endearing about this film is Hogan's character, his charm, lack of tact, surprising strength, rugged looks, Tarzan like abilities, gloriously over the top threads, blatant unknowing male chauvinism and the overall stereotypical rough Aussie masculinity bordering on rudeness we've all heard about. The epitome of the typical Aussie cowboy living in the merciless Aussie outback. Yet despite all that he's still a decent man, good natured, bit of a ladies man and a very likable fellow who does what's right (most times) or what he believes is right. He accepts who he is and we the audience accept it too, he's a bit of a lad (albeit middle aged lad).I tend to think that the rather over board portrayal of 'Mick Dundee' is kinda toyed with for the international audience. I'm sure there are folk like this in the depths of the outback but the extreme stereotyping going on I think is there to make people laugh, give them what they expect but bigger. Everybody has a perception of different people from different countries and this is what many countries probably expected to see (at the time) when it came to Aussie blokes living in the bush (or Aussie males as a whole).The ragtag, scruffy, unwashed, unshaven, dirty shirt wearing bar patrons in 'Walkabout Creek' pretty much some up the humongous stereotyping going on. Or maybe I'm wrong, maybe this IS how blokes in small desert towns of Australia's outback look and behave!. Maybe all the sheila's are rather butch with cropped hair and work behind the bar...beats me, but it seems a tad forced.The plot is pretty much your Prince Charming type affair really, but in the Aussie outback, a modern day Tarzan. The beautiful blonde Kozlowski goes walkabout with Hogan's Dundee, gets into dangerous situations, shown how to survive, meets local Aboriginal tribes folk and slowly falls in love with the athletic bushman.The first half of the film is set in the outback of Oz and displays terrific scenery alongside some great visual gags and exciting moments, including Kozlowski's ass. The second half of the film is set on the streets of New York and again displays some genius visual gags (for the time) alongside more expected exciting moments...you just knew the pair would come across street punks at some point.What is amazing is back in the day (and now even) this film was a fresh idea, it was quite unique and still is really. If you scratch beneath the surface it tends to have a kind of 'Police Academy' motif/theme really, lots of obvious setups for hero moments, love scenes, silly gags etc...But its such a slice of good wholesome cheer I really can't fault it at all.You know what I'm gonna say...looking back this film is horrendously clichéd, cheesy and predictable, seriously so. But back in the 80's this was a tremendous hit and rightly so, it has everything you could want for a great fun time with a lovely happy ending. Only downer I can see is this franchise totally typecast Hogan and pretty much ended his film career as he never bettered this, his best rough bluecollar Aussie charmer.8/10",Crocodile Dundee
55,TOMASBBloodhound,Tepid fish-out-of-water story.,6,4 January 2011,"I cannot believe any portion of this project was nominated for an Oscar. But then again we have the late 1980s in all its glory with mediocre film-making. Paul Hogan wrote and concocted this entire project about a rugged Australian outdoors-man who comes to New York City at the behest of a female writer looking to write his story. What is so interesting about the guy that she would go to such lengths to secure the rights to this man's story? Apparently once a crocodile bit off one of his legs and he had to crawl for several kilometers to help or something of nature. Wanna bet the plucky reporter and her subject fall in love?? Of course they will. And of course she is set to marry a wealthy jerk approved of by her wealthy father and it appears the Aussie will be fighting a losing battle....UGGHHH. I cannot go on with this clichéd plot. You know what happens. From the moment Hogan rescues her from a huge croc in the bush, they will end up together. There are some interesting moments and more than a few chuckles once Hogan arrives in the Big Apple, but not much memorable. The big knife gag basically sold the picture to American audiences that ate this film up. Good thing for Hogan, since once you play a role like Dundee, you will be pegged as that character for life. You'd better have made enough to retire on! He hasn't done much since. Same thing for girlfriend-turned-wife Kozlowsky. She is attractive but adds nothing in terms of acting. There isn't much chemistry between them despite their real life coupling. My favorite part is when two hookers offer to give Dundee ""one"" for free since he is from out of town and helped them with their rough pimp. ""One what?"" he asks. Also got a chuckle when he pours some trendy New Yorker's cocaine into a pot of boiling water thinking the man has a cold and should sniff the steam instead of directly sniffing the powder. He comes off so rugged and sincere that the poor sap cannot even dare to protest.Honestly aside from a few cute sight gags and some clever lines, there isn't much to this project.

The film is very simple and straightforward, but with a tight execution and the charm of Paul Hogan, it works.While it starts off with Linda Kozlowski as the lead, it becomes quickly apparent that the star of this film is Hogan.

A female reporter from New York visits him, hoping to get a story on him. He falls for her and in fact follows her to New York-though she is set to marry another man.Basically it's a ""fish-out-of-water"" comedy, where Dundee is very naive about how the big city is like. (Never mind that Australia has its own big cities such as Sydney.) He is actually unaware of prostitution, transvestites, drug use, etc. Okay, he hasn't been around, but this is ridiculous.At best, this movie is mediocre.

It has a couple of good gags, spread thin like the last knockings of a jar of Vegemite.I definitely remember 'Crocodile Dundee II' - and the totally forgotten 'CD in Los Angeles' - being a painful turkey, it's amazing that this slow, sexist, soporific yawn fooled any of the people, any of the time.

65,nickenchuggets,Crikey,7,17 August 2021,"If there was ever a movie that best summarizes what Australia is all about, this is it. Even those who live there seem to agree since Crocodile Dundee is the most profitable movie Australia has ever made, as well as being the most well known movie there. In any case, the movie is not really what I expected. With such a vague title, I didn't really know what to expect, but only around half the movie is set in australia. As you might be able to figure out, the movie is about Michael ""Crocodile"" Dundee, a bushman from australia who is a master at living in any type of brutal environment his country could throw at him, from the scorching heat of the outback to the thick rainforests of the coasts. The movie is not initially about him though. It starts off in New York where a reporter called Sue (Linda Kozlowski) is working for her father's newspaper company. She is sent to the northern reaches of australia to meet Dundee (Paul Hogan), who has amassed something of a Chuck Norris reputation. He was attacked by a crocodile once and has lived to tell about it, kills snakes with his bare hands, and carries a bowie knife about as big as his forearms. Upon seeing and spending time with him for the first time, Sue is pretty disappointed, but after an encounter with some poachers who kill innocent kangaroos for fun (in which Dundee shoots back at the men), she gains respect for him. Shortly after, Sue tries to venture into the outback by herself, which turns out to be a terrible mistake. She is ambushed by a crocodile resting in a shallow swamp and has to be rescued by Dundee, who kills it with his knife. Sue now feels she owes him something special for saving her, and invites him to america. Upon arriving, Dundee finds the customs of this new land take some getting used to. He's unable to understand american slang and customs, but has been made into an overnight celebrity because of his tough guy status. After some thugs attempt to rob him and Sue, they take one look at his enormous knife and flee. Meanwhile, a guy named Richard asks Sue to marry him during a party at her father's house. Sitting at the dinner table with many others is Dundee, and although he claps when Richard announces his proposal, he is clearly hurt by this. He decides to leave Sue and walk aimlessly around the US, but Sue changes her mind about Rich and follows Dundee to a subway platform. It is swarming with people (even back then) and so numerous people have to repeat Sue's message of ""I love you"" to Dundee before he leaves. Upon hearing that she loves him instead, they make their way through the crowd toward each other, as everyone around them cheers. As stated previously, this movie, while pretty weak in the storyline department, has become something of an australian icon. It was a good thing they got an actual resident of the country to play one, since it makes the movie feel more authentic. Hogan accurately depicts what many people would think of as the typical australian; an extremely masculine outdoorsman who has been hardened by years of enduring one of the most inhospitable places on earth. Anyone who's been to that country knows how full of venomous and deadly animals it is. He has been made remarkably strong because of his environment, just like the creatures there who have to fight to survive. It's also funny how later in the movie (when he gets to New York), he turns on a television to see I Love Lucy playing. Probably one of the last things I expected in a film like this. What the movie does especially well is showcase how different the cultures of america and australia are, despite both being anglo. Australians can barely understand the way americans speak to each other, and this also works the other way around. Even though Dundee does get into various fights during his time in america, he seems to relish in the thrill of violence. This doesn't make him a psychopath in the eyes of Sue, though. From her point of view, it takes a real lunatic to attack a snake with your bare fists, and an even bigger lunatic to eat one. Dundee does both. The negative aspects of this movie primarily stem from it's lack of a compelling story. While Paul Hogan and his antics are enjoyable to watch, the film is very barebones for the most part. You can summarize the whole thing by saying an australian is invited to america by a reporter. Towards the end, when Sue learns Dundee has left her because he feels hurt by her engagement to Richard, she breaks off her engagement to him for seemingly no reason. When I was watching this, I felt like the writers wrote themselves into a corner since they give no explanation as to why she no longer likes Rich. He works at the same newspaper company as her, so she knows him more intimately. It just doesn't make much sense to me and they tried to close the story as fast as possible. Despite its rather weak storytelling, Crocodile Dundee manages to be a both enjoyable and convincing portrayal of a man who is able to survive basically anywhere on earth.",Crocodile Dundee
66,harryplinkett14,An 80s gimmick,3,18 October 2019,"This is an 80s gimmick, about a man from an alien culture coming to New York, facing adversity, and ultimately finding love. All this is told through a series of small, comical scenes that exploit his cultural background. But when you take away all these little scenes, there is little left in terms of plot. We learn absolutely nothing about him or his love interest in the second half of the film, and frankly, the entire second part of the film has no plot whatsoever, other than trying to shove the character of Dundee into as many comedic situations as possible. It all ends with an anticlimax where nothing is at stake and the result is telegraphed from the start.
All this aside, it is an enjoyable film, even today. But the script is painfully thin, and the screenwriters seem obsessed with trying to shove in as many funny scenes as possible, which have little to nothing to do with the plot. A romantic comedy thus turns into an exploitation film that dispenses with storytelling. In the 80s, the audiences were willing to forgive that sort of thing. I found out I needed more.",Crocodile Dundee
67,jhaggardjr,Nice little comedy from Down Under,8,28 April 2001,"""G'Day Mate"". ""Crocodile Dundee"" is an old-fashioned little comedy from Australia that went on to be a huge box-office sensation all over the world when it was released back in 1986. Paul Hogan, who at the time was only known here in the U.S. for those traveling commercials for Down Under, co-wrote and stars in the role that would make him a movie star. Hogan plays Michael J. 'Crocodile' Dundee, a man who lives in the Australian Outback who is interviewed by an American woman from New York (Linda Kozlowski) who's intrigued by his story that he survived a brutal crocodile attack. Her few days with him in the outback become more and more interesting to her that she asks him to accompany her back to New York to wrap up the story. His visit to the Big Apple applies ""Crocodile Dundee"" with some of its biggest laughs. Like the way he looks at things, things that he's never seen before (for example, an escalator when he first arrives at the airport in N.Y.). He also encounters many other things and in the process makes alot of new friends. ""Crocodile Dundee"" may not be the best comedy ever made but its a pretty good one nevertheless. Hogan and Kozlowski are both terrific here, and work well together (they're now married in real life). There's plenty of comedy and adventure abound throughout this movie, and I enjoyed my time with it.*** (out of four)",Crocodile Dundee
68,lagudafuad,A nice charismatic movie,6,2 April 2013,"Arguably you can say Crocodile Dundee doesn't have the perfect story line. You can also add that the acting in some areas could have use a little work and then not to mention the screenplay. Crocodile Dundee is weak in the story area, but then when you look at the film in general the unbelievable likability of the cast and Michael Dundee's (Paul Hogan) charisma, what you have is a movie that whenever you see it you find yourself smiling all the way through.Crocodile Dundee is a classic Australian comedy film that was set in Outback Australia and New York. Paul Hogan felt the movie will shed more light on the bushman behavior and what he will be like if he was brought to America. The movie was a box office success making like 40 times its production cost (budget $8.8 million, commercial success over $328 million) and received with very high positive reviews.The movie's innocent portrayal of the Dundee character makes it easy to fall in love with the guy and how Dundee manages to make new friends and get many people to like him also seemed like a recipe for a good film, which this movie was.The movie plot features our protagonist Michael ""Crocodile"" Dundee, who is popular in Walkabout Creek and the Northern Territory in Australia because of his crocodile hunting skills which left marks on his body.A news reporter from New York Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) heard about his story and went looking for Dundee, found him and then brought him back with her to New York City, where Dundee gets a feel of how life is in the big apple.The movie then transcend into a love story between Dundee and Sue, with a beautiful ending.At the end of this film you will feel relieved and relaxed, and you will be tempted to see what else Dundee will get himself to. The high positive reviews that the movie got and the huge commercial success that it gained in the box office made the producers and Hogan make more sequels. So in 1988 a new Crocodile Dundee movie was released, tagged Crocodile Dundee II, which was less a critical success than the previous film and then 13 years later in 2001 a second sequel was made and tagged Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles.In conclusion this movie is a classic keeper, so I do advise that you get the DVD.www.lagsreviews.com",Crocodile Dundee

70,roghache,Charismatic croc goes walkabout in the Big Apple,9,9 March 2006,"What a wonderful adventure romance! This is a film that neither my husband, my teenage son, or myself can resist watching time after time, whenever it happens to be on TV.The movie tells the tale of Mick Dundee, a charismatic adventurer from Walkabout Creek in the Australian outback, who ends up as a 'croc out of water' (as some reviewers have cleverly phrased it) in New York City. Naturally, there's a 'sheila' with him, a love interest in the form of beautiful blonde American journalist, Sue Charlton. The sparks fly between them, the chemistry cooks, and so on.This movie of course is made solely by the legendary character of Mick Dundee, played to charming perfection by Paul Hogan, both in his native bush and also Big City settings. You'll be in stitches, you'll cheer for him, you'll be amazed at his adaptation of his unique Down Under bush survival skills to the streets of the Big Apple. The knife incident...what can I say? He displays an endearing innocence of the seedier aspects of Big City life, notably its drugs and prostitutes. But it's not only Mick's humour and charisma, this adventurer is a guy with integrity that would put most everyone, rural or urban, Australian or American, to shame. The greatest supporting role here must surely go to Mick's bush buddy, Wally, who's basically 'all talk and no action', yet one of the most likable ever film characters.The ending? I won't give it away, but it's a dilly, a dandy, and a doozy. Just one of the many reasons I can watch this great movie again and again. The first Crocodile Dundee sequel is equally entertaining, and though the second (Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles) doesn't quite measure up, I can never resist watching Mick in action.",Crocodile Dundee
71,PudgyPandaMan,"Charming 80's film, a little dated now",6,19 July 2008,"This was a smash hit in the eighties for star Paul Hogan who created and co-wrote this film. Hogan is quite charming as Nick Dundee, the Australian Croc wrangler. Overall, I'm not sure there is any great acting on his part - you get the feel he is just great at simply being himself in this movie. I think this is proved out by the fact that his movie career never really took off outside of the Dundee franchise.Hogan and co-start Linda Kozlowski seem to have a good chemistry going between them - but turns out this wasn't really due to good acting on their part either. They became a real life couple soon after, wherein he divorced his wife of almost 30 years and married Linda within the year.But there is a definite charm to the movie. It of course looks very dated now and not sure how much it will stand the test of time as being a truly classic movie. But there is fun to be had in watching this. As a side note; I was in my 20's when this film came out and was told I could pass for Linda's twin!",Crocodile Dundee
72,Mort-31,Something's new here.,9,8 February 2001,"Many movies were made about the meeting of different cultures. The meeting cultures varied but the base idea was always the same. For me, Crocodile Dundee` had the touch of something new. But what was it apart from the fact that it had particularly good jokes?I think the secret of Crocodile Dundee` is that it takes both cultures equally seriously. The story is not only about an Australian in the city of New York, it's also about an American in Australia. None of those is preferred to the other: We enjoy the half in Australia as much as the one in New York. And by comparing different elements of life in each country in an ironic way, the filmmakers make it impossible for the viewer (it was so with me, at least  and I'm from Austria, which is another completely different culture) to choose where he would rather live. You can't like one without the other.(The sequel tried to use the same effect, the other way round (first New York, then Australia) and it's also quite nice, but it's not new any more and lacks the main qualities of the first part.) Another reason why this film became a classic is that it has a couple of moments you automatically remember, when you hear the title: the crocodile scene, the kangaroo scene, the scene where Mick meets the prostitutes and of course the final scene.",Crocodile Dundee
73,deepfrieddodo,Iconic Aussie Comedy,8,10 May 2021,"Crocodile Dundee is an 80s classic and iconic for having a lead outside of the usual US narrative. Hogan oozes the natural charisma that allows the story to flow as the whole charm of the film is based purely on that one single character. It's tied to the plot fairly loosely, and the first half hour isn't too funny, but as soon as he hits the Big Apple his contrasts in culture are brilliant. Intelligent humour and a likeable character, it's an easy film which will forever be timeless.",Crocodile Dundee
74,stormhawk2021,Another 80's cult movie,7,24 May 2017,"Like its star Paul Hogan this film was once big, real big, a force to be reckoned with, but has since completely disappeared into obscurity. There was a time when the slender blonde leather faced Hogan was everywhere here in the UK, mainly advertising beer and acting the gruff Aussie, it was very popular. I think what is so endearing about this film is Hogan's character, his charm, lack of tact, surprising strength, rugged looks, Tarzan like abilities, gloriously over the top threads, blatant unknowing male chauvinism and the overall stereotypical rough Aussie masculinity bordering on rudeness we've all heard about. The epitome of the typical Aussie cowboy living in the merciless Aussie outback. Yet despite all that he's still a decent man, good natured, bit of a ladies man and a very likable fellow who does what's right (most times) or what he believes is right. He accepts who he is and we the audience accept it too, he's a bit of a lad (albeit middle aged lad). I tend to think that the rather over board portrayal of Mick Dundee is kinda toyed with for the international audience. I'm sure there are folk like this in the depths of the outback but the extreme stereotyping going on I think is there to make people laugh, give them what they expect but bigger. Everybody has a perception of different people from different countries and this is what many countries probably expected to see (at the time) when it came to Aussie blokes living in the bush (or Aussie males as a whole). The ragtag, scruffy, unwashed, unshaven, dirty shirt wearing bar patrons in Walkabout Creek pretty much some up the humongous stereotyping going on. Or maybe I'm wrong, maybe this IS how blokes in small desert towns of Australia's outback look and behave! Maybe all the sheila's are rather butch with cropped hair and work behind the bar...beats me, but it seems a tad forced. The plot is pretty much your Prince Charming type affair really, but in the Aussie outback, a modern day Tarzan. The beautiful blonde Kozlowski goes walkabout with Hogan's Dundee, gets into dangerous situations, shown how to survive, meets local Aboriginal tribes folk and slowly falls in love with the athletic bushman. The first half of the film is set in the outback of Oz and displays terrific scenery alongside some great visual gags and exciting moments, including Kozlowski's ass. The second half of the film is set on the streets of New York and again displays some genius visual gags (for the time) alongside more expected exciting moments...you just knew the pair would come across street punks at some point. What is amazing is back in the day (and now even) this film was a fresh idea, it was quite unique and still is really. If you scratch beneath the surface it tends to have a kind of 'Police Academy' motif/theme really, lots of obvious setups for hero moments, love scenes, silly gags etc...But its such a slice of good wholesome cheer I really can't fault it at all. You know what I'm gonna say...looking back this film is horrendously clichéd, cheesy and predictable, seriously so. But back in the 80's this was a tremendous hit and rightly so, it has everything you could want for a great fun time with a lovely happy ending. Only downer I can see is this franchise totally typecast Hogan and pretty much ended his film career as he never bettered this, his best rough bluecollar Aussie charmer.",Crocodile Dundee
75,Cedric_Catsuits,Disgusting,1,30 May 2006,"The 1980s was a period when greed & selfishness reached an all-time high, whilst taste reached an all-time low. This movie perfectly reflects this. Laugh at the ridiculous outfits and wince at the desire to be sickeningly ostentatious by all means, but this movie has a much darker side to it. The 'hero' is an arrogant, selfish, chauvinistic bully who kills animals - illegally - for a living. As this is clearly a vehicle for Paul Hogan, one wonders why on earth he did it. Maybe he is proud of this character? I have no idea, but if that is your typical Australian, then I just don't get the attraction.Dundee takes what he wants without a thought for the consequences, and the notion of altruism is entirely unknown to him. As long as he can have what he wants, all is well. He's probably unaware of the existence of other souls. And what he wants, he usually takes with force. Personally, I find the slaughter of animals for their skins or for sport to be abhorrent, and that alone should be reason enough to ban this film. Furthermore, it glamourizes brutality and power - traits that are also common to rapists and paedophiles. Enough said.",Crocodile Dundee
76,twanster-97655,Timeless classic.,9,24 November 2019,"This is one of few films I wished they'd kept making. It's charming and funny, would have been great to see a new film, maybe about mick and his son protecting his gold mine or they could even do something more serious like his son being joining the army and being captured. This possibilities are endless for this because the characters are so well established they could head in any direction. Would only work with original cast, I know some have passed on but they could pull off a great new film still.
The music is perfect for the settings. The supporting cast are brilliant.
I'd give it a 10/10 but I feel the film needed another 30mins to finish properly. One moment the films moving along nicely, an then the next,mick is leaving the party and off for a walkabout and then she announces her love for him and its finished.",Crocodile Dundee
77,buzznzipp1995,Something completely different...,10,24 January 2007,"I had an idea from the television adds that ran, in 1986, for this but i didn't realize that it would be the ""Feel Good Movie"" of the summer!! This was fresh and funnier than quite a few things I'd seen in a long time. To beat all, this was a film that not only had a very clean and unoffensive story, but it was formed out of an experience that Paul Hogan had when he was visiting New York City. This won Golden globe awards for both Paul Hogan and Linda Kozlowski. it was also awarded a Golden Screen Award. On top of that was nominated for an 'Oscar'. It did also win, for best music scoring, Peter Best. Peter Best, don't tell me this was the Beatle's first drummer? That Best??? I saw this when I was 18 and I remember being amazed at the complexity and yet simplistic view played out by Paul's character. Wow! I thought, this was really like a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark "", in a different way. Similar in newness a great story event. Something that made you think and feel, just a little more than others stories. When films were just getting exciting. To me, this was shot intensely well, with talented direction and careful attention to the details, especially the character development. It was new and very exciting to see and feel what all was brought to the screen, in Dolby sound. I realize that some people won't follow what I am saying completely, but as I have learned over the years, not all cinema is equal. I especially love it when He said, ""Jesus Christ and all of them apostles were fishermen, if him and me were working here together, we'd be mates.""This has the ability (I believe) to touch the heart, in an awesome underdog kind of way. My heart was in my throat at the subway scene and I was rooting for Dundee! I recommend this to buy and watch again when you feel like seeing it, and noticing how you can get something different out of it each time you see this. Smart original comedy, with the beautiful 'Outback"" as scenery and even a great chick flick, on a dinner and movie date night. (****)",Crocodile Dundee

So many great things stood out in this film. The film was very funny and enjoyable to watch. Paul Hogans character Mick Dundee is a very likeable, happy and friendly character who is just excellent. I don't know what Linda Kozlowski looks like now Linda but her character Sue Charlton, was absolutely sexy. When she showed her legs in the beginning of the film when speaking to Richard and said ''Don't worry I'm a New Yorker'', her legs were absolutely gorgeous, when Mick was having a bath and he thought the maid Rosetta was there and Sue showed her nice sexy legs to Mick it was amazing to see. She does have some really sexy legs. She was also very beautiful and when she was in Australia and stripped down to her Bikini, she was absolutely sexy. Also the acting by John Meillon as Walter, Mark Blum as Richard and Reginald VelJohnson as Gus was excellent.

Now some time has past there are still some scenes that stand out- generally the whole fish out of water syndrome, but as a whole its not a very good film. Paul Hogan enjoyed a career revival after this film, which is not surprising, it is funny in parts, but its so light and fluffy - almost too light weight to ever be considered a good film. Its not that I dont enjoy it, but its one of those films that you generally watch- (half watch) while you are doing something else, as it requires absolutely no concentration what so ever. It also gives a grossly inaccurate view of the Australian outback, but its almost part fantasy so in that respect it doesnt matter so much. Probably one of those films that people who were around at the time will like, but its unlikely to generate many new viewers.",Crocodile Dundee

He effortlessly oozes charm and witty one-liners and instantly gets you on his side.The film is in two halves, the first half is spent in the outback of Australia where New York reporter Linda Kozlowski flies out to see the legendary crocodile hunter in person to report on his story. Not only is she charmed by small town Australia and the characters she meets but a possible romance starts to develop between the two after Mick Dundee saves her from a near death experience. She is so intrigued by him she brings him back to New York, and this is where the second half begins.The juxtaposition of dusty outback to densely populated city is where much fun is to be had in the script as Hogan milks the fish out of water innocent abroad scenario for all it's worth but does it with subtlety, wit and charm. The memorable one-liner regarding the knife is a classic moment and helps define this breezy romantic comedy.It's still as fresh and enjoyable as the day it hit an unsuspecting audience and thrust Hogan into international stardom almost overnight, although British audiences were already familiar with his dry Aussie wit from the popular Fosters lager commercials of the early 80's.",Crocodile Dundee

Since then there have been plenty of people to discount this movie as formulated & too predictable. I however, enjoyed it for the same reasons as the rest of America. It portrays a simple guy with a healthy attitude towards life in general. His romantic interest is a likeable woman who despite her family's wealth and her obvious good taste in clothes, is also down-to-earth and sincere. I think another reason people liked it was because Dundee's character isn't some over-sized, steroid filled fake that carries an uzi and blows away anything he doesn't like. He has no ""bad"" attitude- he just takes what life gives him and makes the best of it. A lesson that we should all take to heart- but a lesson that the movie manages to get across without being the least bit preachy.

I have seen this movie many times. Crocodile Dundee is a very enjoyable adventurous comedy. Mick Dundee, who is from the Australian outback and used to roughing it, has a knack with overpowering animals and fights crocodiles, goes up against illegal killings of kangaroos and eats snakes. When Sue Charlton arrives from New York city to do a story on Mick, the two hit it off right away and he saves her from a huge crocodile, however, Sue has a boyfriend back home which gets interesting when she brings Mick back to New York with her. From Mick ending up sleeping on the floor because he wasn't used to the plush beds to going out in unfamiliar territory, Mick brings some of his wilderness charm to New York and makes new friends. His up and coming relationship with Sue is put to the test, but all's well that ends well. I loved Crocodile Dundee growing up and I'll continue to love it in the future. Paul Hogan does an amazing acting job as Mick and if you haven't seen this classic I suggest seeing it as soon as you can, it's simply a classic you do not want to miss out on. - Asif Zamir",Crocodile Dundee

The knife scene, the beday, and Dundee greeting everyone he sees in the city with a smile and tipped hat were really good.I was also most impressed by the inclusion of an Aborigine as a normal(ish!) fun guy - they are a much maligned and downtrodden social group in Australia and normally make absolutely no political or media impact in a white-dominated country.Sure, the movie does have its faults and in plot and metaphor you'll have seen it many times before.

Paul Hogan does a fantastic job playing it straight in a role that not many actors could pull off believably. Not all the jokes work, some scenes come off a little bit awkward/unnatural, but for the most part the laughs are abundant, and the fish out of water formula, works surprisingly well and accounts for many hilarious moments. This is a very worth while adventure comedy; I think that if you like the Romancing the Stone movies, you'll like Crocodile Dundee too.

I remember watching this movie with mom. She absolutely loved DunDee and his rough and straightforward perspective on life. Now that I watch it years later, I see many similarities between Dundee and Mexican immigrant perspective.Both perspectives cut the bullshit* and adopt a nihilistic sense of humor. Dundee was very happy in his homeland and left for USA, a strange place where his customs seemed just as alien to everyone else. In the movie's conclusion, as opposed to real life, the Americans embrace the well-meaning, friendly foreigner and take on some of his customs, such as greeting him by saying ""G'day!""Furthermore, the villain Richard (albeit a light villain) is presented as the a-hole not because he is DunDee's romantic rival, but because he openly mocks and belittles DunDee for being a foreigner and being unacquainted with western culture.DunDee functions as the immigrant's fantasy existence, being accepted in America while retaining his cultural roots.",Crocodile Dundee

Just watch how Mick Dundee (sometimes with his side-kick) out-thinking all the predators &/or bad guys in all three movies...in the treacherous hot outbacks of Australia & the mean streets of New York (When a mugger poked a small knife in front of his face, Mick took out his jungle knife & said: ""That's not a knife. This is a knife!)...& mercilessly cold concrete jungle of Los Angeles. On the whole, I have enjoyed watching again all the three movies, each with its own engaging story & romantic notion of adventure. As a strategy consultant/success coach on life (survival) skills, I have added these three movies to my resource repertoire.",Crocodile Dundee
96,aamilsyed,Hasn't aged well at all,5,11 December 2019,"This film might have been popular in the 80s with its overt racism, miaogyny and trans and homo phobia. However, the film is incredibly offensive and tries to pass off problematic behavior as naivety.. which is disingenuous. Only cis-hetero white people can appreciate this movie without feeling any uneasiness. I hope they stop lauding this movie and see it for what it is.. racist, sexist and transphobic.",Crocodile Dundee
97,bcostin,"A funny, simple, sentimental movie.",8,4 July 1999,"There's not much complicated about this movie, and that's a good thing. It's a pretty simple fish-out-of-water plot, with Dundee (Paul Hogan, of course) doing an excellent job as a goodhearted, plainspoken, and cheerful Aussie in the Big City. Lots of great lines and funny moments, and the performances are all well done. Call me a sentimental fool, but the ending always makes me smile.",Crocodile Dundee

Been standing there for 600 million years. Still be there when you and I are gone. So arguing over who owns them is like two fleas arguing over who owns the dog they live on.""With my continuing thirst for Australian New Wave films, I was inevitably bound to come across Crocodile Dundee sooner or later. I've been dreading this film, as this spoof on Australian outback has haunted the country since its release. Reinforcing masculin Ocker stereotypes and it ultimately destroyed the reputation of Australians by degrading us to a bunch of macho dim-witted provincial Galahs. For all of the valour and integrity of the other films I have reviewed, none of them broke international boundaries entirely as Crocodile Dundee does. It was the highest-grossing Australian films, and one of the highest-grossing non-Hollywood films ever made. It remains the only Australian film many foreigners have seen, and although not a bad movie in and of itself, ultimately its legacy has made it unbearable.",Crocodile Dundee

However I think this movie should have shown the two main locations a bit longer and the ending could have been better (it's still satisfying though).7/10",Crocodile Dundee

When she arrives, she finds Mick Dundee-a macho Australian raised in the Outback by Aborigines who has never been to a city (but he does still have his leg with scarring from a crocodile's ""love bite""). He shows the reporter his home complete with animals, hikes, and Aborigines. The two return to New York City and Mick finds himself lost in the big city-what follows are the expected humorous ""fish out of water"" scenes that include Mick discovering indoor plumbing and prostitutes.Of course, as a romantic comedy, there's also the obligatory love triangle between Mick, the reporter, and the reporter's boyfriend in New York. And, of course, the movie ends with a heart-warming scene.""Crocodile"" Dundee is a light-hearted movie with beautiful scenes from Australia, a funny look at life in New York City, and likeable characters.

(unsheathes his signature bowie knife) That's a knife.""",8,29 March 2020,"Crocodile Dundee (1986) , Crocodile Dundee II (1988) , Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles (2001)The first film is an indisputable classic. Well, romantic adventures in the wild plains of Africa was the norm back then when a filmmaker needs something exotic to spice things up (King Solomon's Mines (1950), The African Queen (1951), The Gods Must Be Crazy (1980), Out of Africa (1985), etc). This film was a breath of fresh air for the rather hackneyed sub-genre, and it inadvertently put the Aussie Outback in the spotlight. The depiction of the Outback was pretty mesmerizing in my opinion; it was mystical and awe-inspiring at the same time, and the dangers depicted were so much more different than those in Africa.Apart from that, it is understandable that you have seen tonnes of films depiction the culture shocks that foreigners experience when they come to America, but if you are curious as to how an Aussie from the Outback would react, this is the film for you.P. S. I kinda enjoyed the third film even though it doesn't live up to my expectations. Maybe I am just too much of a fanboy.",Crocodile Dundee
109,lolidunno16,This movie was on the upper side of average,6,25 May 2015,"In my opinion, this movie was on the upper side of average. It gave me a few laughs, and the ending was amazing, but I will not spoil it, to keep this review spoiler free.For me, the main issue with this film was the pacing. A couple of parts felt very long and drawn out with filler. The first fifteen minutes were extremely boring and dull. This film can be a test of a person's patience, especially the first fifteen minutes. But everything changes after that, the film picks itself off the ground and becomes a fun ride, even if there is some padding here and there. It's not a movie I'd actively seek out to watch again, but maybe if there was seriously nothing else on, I might watch a bit of it.6/10.",Crocodile Dundee

Revolving around a very colorful, witty and worry-free Australian crocodile poacher(Paul Hogan), it is a feel-good movie filled with many laughs and and witty one-liners.It offers many laughs in the way of culture shock to both the reporter and Dundee himself. Giving not only a glimpse at culture in the outback, but also in bustling Manhattan. Dundee's innocence of adapting to the fast lifestyle of New York is a formula for laughter.Paul Hogan plays a highly likable character, playing off of Linda Kozlowski perfectly, their chemistry is a major contributor to the overall success of this movie. It is filled with scenes of action and comedy, framed into a film that will make you laugh and feel good.7/10",Crocodile Dundee
113,C-dog-3,That's not a knife. This is a knife!,9,31 January 1999,"This movie was one of the biggest comedy hits of its day and yet it is still under-appreciated.  I don't remember anyone complaining when they first came out of the theatre, and yet people make fun of it because it is so simple. This movie reminds me of those old comedy-romances of the 30's and 40's. Paul Hogan is perfect as the country boy from Australia who gets together with the big-city girl from NY, NY.  Hogan has a lot of chemistry with his female counterpart who he eventually married in real life.  Anytime I need a little cheering up I just pop this baby in.

115,johnnysixguns,Truly one of my all time favourites!,10,27 December 2015,"This is one of those rare movies for me that I've never gotten over or ever gotten sick of. I love the fish out of water plot line when Sue goes to Australia. Mick almost seems to be the bumbling character that stumbles upon being great at things like checking Wallys watch then looking at the sun to tell the time (priceless). Reminds me of inspector gadget kinda. But there's other times where he shows his true skill and sort of downplays it. The point is he was raised by outback tribes people and may actually have a sixth sense or aboriginal powers!?? I don't know!Then Sue asks for him to go to New York City with her. So if you like the fish out of water type story...what happens in this is a double whammy! First Sue is the fish and Mick's in his element (survival, nature, buffalo hypnosis!). Then they switch to where Mick sees a city for the first time ever. Overloaded with people, too much going on, and Sue ends up looking out for him. Then you have the love. It actually is a love story. Pacing is great there's an obstacle or two to overcome. And if you take the fact that they are falling in love on screen and off screen. it's really great to watch. If you haven't seen it in years and all it is to you now is a cliché or just big knife quotes you should really check it out again. I know its not on any top lists anywhere but I can't help but love it! Not even in a guilty pleasure way but in an actual good fun entertaining way.The writing I give 10 stars The acting I give 10 stars The love I give 10 stars The soundtrack 10 stars...11 if I could! love that theme song.",Crocodile Dundee

118,alanberdan,One hit wonder,8,18 February 2010,"608 unknown actors get together and make a hit movie. Who knew? It certainly is a charming fish out of water story with a slight twist. We get to see two fish out of water as the newsy nose reporter is out of her element in the northern territory of some English speaking wasteland. Then our law breaking croc poaching hero gets to go to some English speaking large city and feel just as weird. I think a sequel is in order. Perhaps 3 or 4 even. The only thing is a backwoods hic from Arkansas would have been just as entertaining as a backwoods hic from the worst country on the planet earth. I mean look at American idol, everyone roots for the white trash loser to make it to Hollywood. Why make it an English wannabe? Anyway no one knew anyone in the film before it was made and none of them have done anything since.

120,whynot-12,Disappointing,2,9 May 2006,"As an Australian citizen, I'm really disappointed that this movie had any recognition of being anything but 3rd rate cinematographic crap in the US and Europe.This is because Oz actually produces some very good movies, even if they never make it outside down-under.It is such a shame because Paul Hogan is quite a nice dude in real life, and a very funny and likable character on Oz TV. His acting in the movie is not really the issue - the issue is that the script is the pits, and the director must have been trying for Canne's worst movie of the year award.If only it was some dumb action-packed movie with fancy & spectacular video effects, one could struggle through it. Unfortunately, no such thing. Not only is it stupid beyond belief, but it is boring as hell.Again, this is not in the least an anti-Oz-film criticism: I think Australia's film industry is small but of good quality overall, and it saddens me that the only Oz movie Americans can think of when Oz film industry is mentioned is ""Crocodile Dundee"".Well, my wife is American, and this is what she tells me: ""Oz movies?
