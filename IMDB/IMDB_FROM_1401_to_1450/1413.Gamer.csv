0,Leofwine_draca,A film where the violence is extreme and the women are sex objects,4,20 July 2016,"Imagine a version of THE RUNNING MAN, updated to the 21st century, and cross it with the popularity of modern-day video games (mainly Second Life and Call of Duty) and you have GAMER, an action film just as cheesy as the Schwarzenegger ""epic"". GAMER is the latest hyperventilation from the directing duo who brought us the two CRANK films, and its similarly outlandish, with a no-holds-barred approach to sex and violence. Sad to say, it's also pretty awful, one of those films which is going to date quickly and which has a dull-witted script keen to go through the usual clichés and gross-out moments.From the beginning, your mind is assailed by all manner of outrageousness: stripping teenagers, sexual scenarios, bloody 'gib' hits in a video shooter played in 'real life'; all depicted via a frenetic medium that never stays on a single shot longer than a second and which makes for headache-inducing viewing in all but the most casual viewer. Yes, this is another of those films squarely aimed at the teenage male market, and even though I'm not 30 yet, I had the distinct impression that I was ""too old for this"".High art it ain't: the dialogue is extremely lowbrow, the on-screen action frequently ludicrous. Gerard Butler seems to accept any old film that comes his way, and GAMER is another in a strong of disappointments for the Scottish star. He grunts and frowns his way through a one-dimensional character arc and the best you can say about him is that he's fairly believable. The supporting cast is made up of tired stereotypes: Michael C. Hall is the worst thing here as the utterly irritating 'nerd' super-villain, and Kyra Sedgwick (Kevin Bacon's squeeze) fairly appalling as a TV journalist. Logan Lerman, so good in 3:10 TO YUMA, is distinctly bland, and Ludicrous leads a band of utterly clichéd hacker geeks. The genuinely interesting actors, John Leguizamo and Keith David, are tucked away in nothing roles. The only character of distinction is Terry Crews' hulking brute of a villain, a man whose body mass rivals that of Aussie wrestler Nathan Jones, but apart from a single menacing scene, he's also wasted. Worst of all is the script's attitude to women, who are treated as victims (dying quickly and brutally) or as sex objects. Amber Valletta (TRANSPORTER 2) has a particularly demeaning role, forced to bend about in her underwater for endlessly repulsive scenes.So, apart from crude sex references and a predictable script, what are we left with? A handful of action sequences is the answer, and these would be good – if it wasn't for the dumb editing. The whole 'fight for your life' theme was done better in the DEATH RACE remake with Jason Statham, but there are some mildly entertaining moments here too, mostly involving Butler blowing away countless enemies and breaking one particularly loathsome character's back over his knee. The extended climax offers some one-vs-many fun too, even if the homage to WARRIOR KING is a little too obvious for my liking.",Gamer
1,SnoopyStyle,Aggressively ugly viewing,4,8 December 2013,"In the future, rich and powerful Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall) creates a gaming environment where gamers can use real people as avatars. Eventually, he would use death row inmates in a fight to the death game called 'Slayer'. Kable (Gerard Butler) is one of those death row avatars who scrambles to gain his freedom.This is an aggressively ugly viewing experience. Everything is in-your-face. The computer interactions are in-your-face. The people are ugly in-your-face. The CGI and the flashing cuts are so distracting that the story is but a sideshow. While I want to see the premise play out, it is too tiring to maintain my interest. The idea of using real people as avatars is actually very fascinating. I just can't deal with all the bells and whistles.",Gamer
2,nogodnomasters,I HAVE NO STRINGS ON ME,8,2 May 2019,"The film has a similar theme as ""Rollerball."" An individual becomes larger than the game, so the game must be changed to take care of the individual. Nanotechnology, the technology that makes friction free ketchup bottles, will allow us to place a controlling chip in a human's brain that will allow someone else to control their actions, speech etc. People pay to be controllers and get paid to be controlled.There is a society aspect to the game where people are controlled for their own perverted pleasures. Criminals are controlled in a Slayer game where they fight with simulated automatic weapons. Kable (Gerard Butler) is our James Caan. He is a criminal on death row whose crime we see in a flashback. He is controlled by a 17 year old kid named Simon (Logan Lerman) as in Simon Says. After 30 successful games, a criminal gets set freed. No one has done it yet, Kable is close.To prevent his freedom, a ringer with no controller (faster reflexes) is placed in the game to get Kable. There is also an anarchist group known as ""HUMAN"" who is at work sabotaging the Matrix, eh ah the system.I liked the Marilyn Manson soundtrack, but I thought they tried to get too cute at the end and instead should have just gone with a quick ""Running Man"" ending. They should have shortened the film instead of burdening us further with the message that poor people will prostitute themselves to the rich who enjoy being in control.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, nudity.",Gamer
3,jboothmillard,Gamer,1,3 June 2013,"I had seen the DVD for this film a few times, and I am sure I must have seen a clip or trailer during the time it was in cinemas, so I was a bit surprised when I saw the critics giving the film the lowest ratings, I had to know why. Basically in the year 2020, in New York, inventor Ken Castle (Dexter's Michael C. Hall) has revolutionised the gaming industry by creating the digital multi-player game Slayers, where nanites have been place in the brains of death row criminals which allow people playing the game to control these criminals to kill each other. The aim of the game is to complete up thirty levels without being killed and then the criminal will be released, no criminal has been successful in completing all levels, but close to achieving this is John 'Kable' Tillman (Gerard Butler) who has reached level twenty seven, becoming the most recognisable face of the game. Seventeen year old player Simon Silverton (Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief's Logan Lerman) is the ""handler"" of Kable, but the criminal able to communicate with him knows the game creators will not want him to win and gain release, so the young player lets him go and fend for himself in order to get back to his family. Managing to escape from the game world and the prison Kable goes to confront the Slayers creators, specifically rich mad man Castle, but of course he will battle his way through game players, meet a rebel group called the Humanz, conquer real life challenges, and go against the numerous henchmen and obstacles along the way. It should be mentioned that the technology for the inmates has been placed in the brains of people in the public in all circumstances, so we also see game plays, of all shapes and sizes, living out their fantasies with people who have the nanites. Also starring Amber Valletta as Angie 'Nika' Roth Tillman, Drag Me to Hell's Alison Lohman as Trace, Terry Crews as Hackman, John Leguizamo as Freak, Aaron Yoo as Humanz Dude, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges as Humanz Brother, The Possession's Kyra Sedgwick as Gina Parker Smith, Zoe Bell as Sandra, Heroes' Milo Ventimiglia as Rick Rape and Keith David as Agent Keith. Butler has his moments being aggressive but it is otherwise pretty flat, Hall does alright as the very nasty villain but is a bit pantomime, Ventimiglia makes an embarrassing appearance as a character with an awful name being sleazy, and hardly any other cast members are worth mentioning. I was hoping for something cool and exciting, with its mixing of The Running Man, Death Race, The Condemned and some mind control film, but the special effects were hardly worth putting effort into, the story is predictable, the plot is too obvious, the film is filled with disgusting material, especially the sweaty obese man using an avatar to be a womaniser, no satire and violence can save this film from being a complete waste of time, a rubbish futuristic action thriller. Poor!",Gamer
4,ma-cortes,Moving and violent story with intense and raw struggles by TV broadcasting,6,26 July 2010,"Set in a totalitarian society , a future-world where powerful humans can rule other unfortunates humans in mass-scale, multi-player online gaming environments, star player from two games called ¨Society ¨ and ""Slayers"" looks to get his independence while taking down the game's mastermind . Kable (Gerad Butler) is a convict who was wrongly framed for killing and condemned to death penalty . Castle (Michael C Hall) is the manager of a game show wherein convicted delinquents are given the chance to run to freedom but have to elude the stalkers; men who hunt them down and kill them in gruesome manners . With full control over the media, Castle attempts to quell the nation's yearning for freedom by broadcasting a number of game shows on which convicted criminals fight for their lives. The most popular and sadistic of these programs is ¨Slayers¨ . 17-year-old Simon (Logan Lerman) controls Kable and leads him around the battle camp . After massacring most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the war zone . Kable arranges to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere the show's next contestant. Furthermore , we watch Kable's spouse named Angie (Amber Valletta) going to work as a rare role in Society . Angie also is controlled by a fat man . Elsewhere, the convicts for Slayers are being transported to the next battlefield . Kable gets escape and tries to free Angie .This stirring picture displays noisy action , thrills , lots of violence and some doses of nudism . This movie is about as action-packed and adrenaline-punched , an action movie you're going to see in a while . It's stylishly made, with lots of tense action from the beginning to the end to keep one satisfied. The motion picture provides fast and furious amusement with spectaculars scenes . The tale packs unstopped movement and is extremely entertaining for action lovers and video-games fans . The battle scenes are made with authentic stunts but also by C.G.I . This story about a chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad is professionally told , though it results to be a post-modern version of ¨The running man (1987)¨ by Paul Michael Glaser and based on a Stephen King's novel . Directors, writers , producers Brian Taylor and Mark Neveldine present an eye-popping glimpse at the television of tomorrow . This witty slice of sociological future world keeps the action flowing throughout, and presents us with some bizarrely fascinating villains , especially played by Michael C Hall , as well as the usual action frolics. One query, however , is over the high level of violence and some erotic scenes that contain this exciting film . Rating : 5,5 . Acceptable and passable .",Gamer
5,Quinoa1984,full of ideas but dreary/dull some-time-in-the-future picture,5,15 September 2009,"Brian Taylor and Mark Neveldine are filmmakers I'll want to look out for for a while. The first two Crank films they made are bubble gum soaked in chicken-flavored gasoline and they're superb at being just relentlessly tasteless fun with a gimmick that is ripped from DOA for part one and High Voltage you just have to see for yourself. But with their third film as a writer/director combo, Gamer, they take themselves far too seriously for their good. This might have not been a problem had they been able to take all of their ideas into better fruition. The chief idea in Gamer is that (literally) a corporate mind-f***er uses his billions to create two virtual-reality simulation games, one called Society and one called Slayers. The former is like the Sims where people strap themselves in and create their own people (but are actually people already) and put them in a 'society' of crazy interaction. The latter is more like a Halo or shoot-em-up with lots of soldiers ala Death Race fighting for their death-row pardon.Neveldine and Taylor have passion going on for this project, but they also don't know how to create an action scene past a certain point. For the Crank films their adrenaline-junkie style suited perfectly. For this, when we see the first big action shoot-em-up scene with the Slayers, the done in a style where we can pretty much see what's going on with the cranked-up (some pun intended) camera-work, while the editing is what makes things completely unhinged and detached. I never got involved in the action after a certain point because the filmmakers didn't try anything new. It is, I suppose then, much akin to a rated-MA video game, only here controlled by the likes of a 17 year old punk who takes over the 'star' Kable played by Gerard Butler.When we see the ideas introduced and the whole method of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall) with how he is able to lock the players in with their playees (aka slaves) and how this is one of those insidious plots that could stretch out across the entire world, it sounds interesting. But, again, nothing is taken as far as it should be... except, of course, with other ideas that are just ripped out of a lot of other action movies. Such as, for example, the whole thing with Kable, how he's got a wife and daughter and is actually a good guy who was (spoiler) controlled in the state of mind he was in when he killed someone and got on death row, and has to escape and becomes part of the resistance and then goes after Ken Castle who has his daughter and yada-yada. Even when Butler is put up against a very scary/big looking black dude played by Terry Crews it's not done quite enough for laughs, and too over the top to be taken seriously.The visual style is also drab, full of grays and browns and without much texture - that is until you get into 'Society' which, for me, looked much more interesting even with Taylor/Neveldine's typical frenetic camera and obsession with the grotesque and breasts and S&M imagery. I suppose it may be a matter of taste up to a point, as I'm not a hardcore gamer and looked at it more as a movie in and of itself as opposed to a big gushing exploitation-homage to 21st century video games. But even some of the die-hard Call of Duty or Sims players may tire of the head-thudding camera and fx and Butler's too low-key performance (or just bland). Only Michael C. Hall really gets it, and sinks his teeth into a character who, frankly, should have been more prominent as the big-bad Big-Brother-incarnate antagonist (at the least he's given a musical number late in the film to ""I Got You Under My Skin"".If you love a solid action movie, or like what these guys have done, it might be worth it to see it, but it's nothing to rush out for. It's admirable that they made a first big, grungy attempt at achieving a place in the important-post-apocalypse movie sub-genre. But it's also sad that it keeps moving forward without anywhere interesting to go.",Gamer
6,BandSAboutMovies,Instantly dated,3,30 August 2018,"From the first scene in this film, a journey across the world with propaganda messages across familiar landmarks and a gun battle that feels like a First Person Shooter, Gamer feels way more dated than a movie that came out nine years ago.Gamer is a world of what the late 90's and early 2000's saw as our future: blips, ultraviolence, video games, nu-metal and reality TV. I hate to say that for the most part, it's gotten a lot of it correct.In 2034, Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall, Dexter) invents self-replicating technology that replaces brain tissue, allowing people to control one another and see through their eyes. Called Nanex, Castle uses this technology to create Society, a virtual life game ala Second Life (remember that?). His next idea is Slayers, a game that allows people to control prisoners on death row as they battle in a gladiator arena. Any Slayer that survives the game thirty times gets their freedom. But that's never happened.John ""Kable"" Tillman (Gerard Butler, 300) is the most popular Slayer there is. He's made the record for survival - 27 matches - all controlled by Simon (Logan Lerman, The Perks of Being a Wallflower), a rich kid and superstar gamer.Meanwhile, Humanz (they are from the streets, as the z will tell you), an anti-Slayers organization, hacks the Gina Parker Smith (Kyra Sedgwick, Singles, Hearts and Souls) Show when Castle makes an appearance. Their voice comes from Brother, played by Ludacris. Remember when I told you this movie was firmly of its time?Castle is more concerned with the fact that Kable might win Slayers, so he brings in a new player, Hackman (Terry Crews, The Expendables), a psychotic inmate who is not controlled by a player and who suffers no lag time.There's also a guy named Freek (John Leguizamo, Spawn) who befriends Kable. And oh yeah, Kable's wife Nika (Amber Valetta, What Lies Beneath) is a Society avatar who is rich from being part of the game but can't get their daughter, Delia, back.Let's talk about the Society game. It's every late 1990's teenage daydream on crack and filtered through pure scum and not in a good, fun Eurohorror way, either. There are characters like Vaginablender and mostly players either have sex or rollerblade or rollerblade while having sex.There's a horrible scene here where Simon talks to his female fans, including Stikkimuffin, his sister SISSYPUSS, a girl with a tongue that's been pierced 25 times or so and two British twins named Kumdumpstaz. It looks like it was filmed inside a bottle of Mountain Dew and then someone jacked off all over it.Meanwhile, the Humanz contact Kable and Simon, warning them that there's no escape. Instead, they modify Kable to control himself again. Simon is labeled a cheater, has all of his assets frozen and the FBI investigates him (Keith David shows up!).Kable heads to the Humanz' HQ, but he refuses to be part of the fight. Instead, he finds and rescues his wife before meeting up with the talk show host - who is really helping the Humanz. Once his nanites are deactivated, Kable remembers that he was tested on while in the military and Castle mentally controlled him, forcing him to kill his best friend.Of course, the main bad guy in the movie was the person who stole Kastle's daughter.Of course, he goes to get her back.Of course, Castle has already killed all of the Humanz.Castle reveals that he has a brain that is 90% nanites and thanks to an airborne virus, he'll soon control the whole country. Hackman then attacks, but Kable kills him quickly. But Castle stops our hero, as his nanites have been reactivated.But wait! Gina and Trace (Alison Lohman, Drag Me to Hell) have survived and hack their way in. They reveal the secrets of Castle to the world and allow Simon to have control of Kable all over again.Just in time - Castle was trying to get Kable to kill his own daughter, but Simon and Castle are now battling for control. Finally, Tillman tells Castle to imagine being stabbed, which allows him to break his control and kill the final boss. Then, he deactivates both Slayers and Society.Finally, the Tillman family walks down a country road when the words ""Game Over"" appear. I'd ask if this was all a dream, but I'm not certain this movie is ready to make a narrative jump like that.Gamer comes from the team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, who were also responsible for Crank, Crank: High Voltage, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and The Vatican Tapes. Whereas the Crank films feel like gleeful bursts of anarchy, this is a movie made by a mainstream studio that seeks to bite the hand that feeds. And unlike a film like They Live that escapes from the big budget process, this film takes so much glee in showing us the Slayers and Society worlds that you tend to wonder which side of the coin they are falling upon.Also - Michael C. Hall appears to be in a completely different movie than everyone else. It's like he wanted to sing and dance through an entire scene, so they said, ""Hey, why not?""Oh man - I also forgot that there's a scene where Kable fills up a car by drinking gasoline, then puking and urinating into a gas tank. If this makes you want to watch this film, have at it!",Gamer
7,dbborroughs,Pointless,3,15 September 2009,confused and confusing story about a big corporation that uses criminals as real life players in an interactive video game thats controlled by people at home. There's other stuff going on like a look at the media and a plot to take over the world but very little of it amounts to much. Mostly it was lots of shooting and explosions with a confused and confusing story show horned in. Frankly if I had wanted to watch a video game I would have pulled out my Wii. I really didn't like the film much and kept wondering why the actors we're involved since they all tend to pick better material than this trash. While not one of the worst films of the year its is one of the most disposable and one I wished I could have tossed in the garbage when it was over.,Gamer
8,zardoz-13,Neveldine & Taylor Go Mainstream!,8,9 September 2009,"Although it is neither as hilarious nor as outlandish as Mark Neveldine & Brian Taylor's two ""Crank"" epics with Jason Statham, the hyperactive virtual reality movie ""Gamer,"" starring Gerard Butler, represents a distinct change of pace for its dynamic duo. Co-writers & co-directors Neveldine & Taylor have jettisoned their usual edgy humor and amoral protagonist. Indeed, they've gone mainstream with ""Gamer."" Meaning, they're playing things pretty much straightforward. The hero lives and breathes to be reunited with his wife and daughter after being framed for a crime that he didn't commit of his own volition. ""Gamer"" qualifies as essentially a first-person shoot'em up saga about a convicted death row inmate trapped in a live, worldwide pay-per-view video game who must survive 30 suicidal missions to win his freedom. The despicable villain is the enterpreur who created an amoral, gladiatorial game called 'Slayers' where death row inmates battle to the death. The problem with ""Gamer"" is it relies too heavily on conventional formulaic material from actioneers like ""The Matrix,"" ""Death Race,"" ""Scanners,"" and ""The Condemned,"" so that its ending is a foregone conclusion.Nevertheless, ""Gamer"" boasts a sterling cast and some of the rawest visceral action footage since the ""Crank"" movies. The idea that in the not-to-distant future people will play simulated games on-line with real people as their avatars is inventive, and ""Gamer"" has beaten both the Bruce Willis movie ""Surrogate"" as well as James Cameron's forthcoming 3-D epic ""Avatar"" to the punch. Butler proves his credentials as a brawny action hero, while Michael C. Hall of Showtime's ""Dexter"" makes quite an impression as a sly, slippery, white-trash talking villain whose comeuppance is a joy to behold. While nobody had an ounce of virtue in the ""Crank"" movies, ""Gamer"" is about a true-blue hero who sets out to thwart an evil villain that dreams of manipulating human thinking through the ruse of video games. Unfortunately, ""Gamer"" lacks surprises but Neveldine & Taylor compensate largely with adrenaline thrills and chills.Consequently, ""Gamer"" is a conspiracy thriller crossed with a big dumb actioneer with a sci-fi flavor since it takes place in the year 2034. Fearless billionaire video game programmer Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall of ""Dexter"") has developed an interactive simulation game where the players control real-life people in the sex game Society which he bills as the ""ultimate sin environment."" Castle has developed a unique method of mind control involving nanotechnology so that the players can live through their avatars. When the avatars are in the game, the players jack into their cortex and rule them. After the game concludes, the avatars are allowed to resume their normal lives. For example, an obscenely obese gamer named Gorge (Ramsey Moore) dines on fistfuls of waffles drenched in syrup while he controls a red hot sexy chick, Angie (Amber Valletta of ""Premonition""), in Society. Never leaving his apartment, Gorge slouches in a motorized chair while he gorges himself. A stereotypical gamer, Gorge puts words into his avatar's mouth, dresses her in exotic costumes, and makes her perform with other avatars.The success of Society prompted Castle to create Slayers where players supervise death row prisoners in combat. The catch to this game is the lag time between when the player tells their avatar to shoot, jump, or dodge bullets and the avatar's response time. The greatest combatant in Slayers thus far is Kable (Gerard Butler of ""The Ugly Truth"") whose real name is Tillman. The player controlling Kable is a 17-year old guy, Simon (Logan Lerman), who is the envy of all on-line gamers. They offer him sex and money to take over control of Kable, but Simon isn't about to relinquish his control of Kable. Together, Kable and Simon have won 27 matches and it appears that Kable might be the first inmate to reach 30.Meantime, Castle has more wealth than Bill Gates and behaves like a reclusive Howard Hughes type. He appears on a telecast interview show with media sensation Gina Parker Smith (Kyra Sedgwick of ""The Closer"") who quizzes him about the legality of Slayers. Castle points out that the Federal Department of Corrections helped organize the game and the game helps fund prisons. Furthermore, he adds that every inmate in the game has volunteered for it. Nevertheless, Castle is afraid of Kable, enough so that he brings in a killer, Hackman (Terry Crews of ""Street Kings""), to polish Kable off. Unlike the other participants in Slayers, Hackman is a free agent who operates without a player supervising him. Castle appears to be well on the way to victory over Kable until a faction of hackers led by Humanz (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges of ""Max Payne"") helps Kable escape during his 30th mission and carry on without Simon dictating his every move. Indeed, Humanz contacts Simon and briefs him about the Castle conspiracy.Watching ""Gamer"" isn't quite like playing a first-person shooter game. Although the action is loud, noisy, and white-knuckled, it lacks the violence of games like ""Fallout 3"" where characters vanish in explosions of blood whenever they are shot. The hero and villain are both mortal enemies who never give an inch, but the predictable storyline undercuts its hard-knuckled action. If the ""Crank"" movies amounted to an exercise in irresponsible amorality, then ""Gamer"" constitutes an exercise in responsible morality use where the hero restores order to the universe.",Gamer
9,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Definitely needed some more beta testing before release,6,25 July 2020,"In America, at some point in the not too distant future, gladiatorial death matches are made legal. If you survive 30 battles, you're released. And guess who has 27 under his belt? Kable(Butler, sadly not as over-the-top as in 300). He wants out so he can protect... his vintage car? no, wait: his wife and daughter. It's just that they have so little agency and impact on the plot, they might as well be. They literally exist so that the audience have an easier time empathizing with him. I mean, he is a death row inmate. Did I not make mention of that part of already the ridiculous concept yet? I don't know why this isn't set in a dictatorship(or a country ruled by corporations, a la RoboCop), as these would make the idea so much easier to believe.I wanted to love this movie. Satire and social commentary are among the best and most important fiction. When it's done right. One of the big problems is that this appears to have an incredibly cynical outlook on regular people. Including its own audience. And the hypocrisy of criticising the popularity of films including violence, sexuality and other provocative materials, while being a prime example of such. The filming and editing are as stylized as the excellent Crank movies, without the frantic pace, simplicity and, well, clearly those are not set in our reality, which makes it a lot easier to accept the outlandish stuff.I recommend this to anyone willing to wade through the frustrating elements of this, because if you are, there really are some incredible things in this. 6/10",Gamer
10,neil-476,Action for the sake of action doesn't work,6,16 September 2009,"Video game fans are able to play Sims and shoot-'em-up type games using real people, controlled by nanite processors injected into their brains. Convicted murderer Kable (Gerard Butler) is about to complete 30 successful missions, following which he will earn his freedom. However, the powers that be have other ideas.This is a sci-fi action thriller which is set firmly within Matrix territory. It is written and directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor who were also responsible for the idiotic and hugely enjoyable Crank 2, and it shows much of the same hyper kinetic filming and editing style.The story is actually decent if fairly predictable, with a reasonable range of characters, motivations, and reasons for action. Butler is fine, and so are the rest of the cast.All is not totally well, though. Personally, I have had nearly enough of relentlessly kinetic action sequences. Yes, I know it is supposed to emulate first person point of view video games, but it becomes tiring to watch. And furthermore, there is a great deal of it in the opening third of the movie, which is well before we have learned who Kable is and why we should care about him. It would have been better to reduce the opening combat sequences by, say, 20 minutes (yes, there's that much of it), and then give us some more of it when the action actually had a point ie. when we cared whether Kable lived or died.",Gamer
11,FlashCallahan,Under my skin....,6,22 January 2010,"Gamer is part 'The Running man', part 'The Truman show' but on acid.plot is simple, prisoners can get a pardon if they can survive a game called 'slayers' where they are controlled by someone using them as an Avatar. Gerard Butler wants out....thats it.If You are familiar with the duo behind the Crank movies, you will know the kind of trippy movie you will get from the directors.Visually the film is sound, there are some amazing shots and scenes, and it rumbles along at a nice pace. But the story is something that we have seen before, you could get any major Sci-Fi movie from the last ten years, and there will be some kind of resemblance to the film in this.Charachtwers are wasted, and other characters are predictable.Only Hall and Sedgewick really stand out, especially the freaky dance routine at the end, so stupid, it's actually the most genius part of the film.Butler is okay, but anyone could have been the main character, the film will do no harm (or good) to his career.it's an instantly forgettable movie, which is exciting in places.",Gamer
12,zetes,"Perhaps too flawed to recommend highly, but I found it interesting, great to look at and all-around pretty good",7,24 January 2010,"Not a very successful film, but it has some interesting ideas and a great visual sense. Neveldine/Taylor is a team that is best known for the Crank movies. This is their third film (actually made before Crank 2). Judging just from these three movies, I think someday they will create something truly impressive. The story of Gamer takes place in the near future, where video games have pretty much become the main source of entertainment. A media mogul played by Dexter star Michael C. Hall has invented a way for gamers to control real people. His first game was very much like The Sims or Second Life. It was a big success and made him a billionaire. His second game is Slayer, a first person shooter where the players control death row inmates who shoot and blow each other up. Gerard Butler plays the hero of the game, an inmate who has survived 27 games (and is promised to be released after game #30). He is controlled by a 17 year old superstar, played by Logan Lerman. Now, the main problem with this film is that its central premise is never that believable. What exactly makes it interesting for gamers to play as a real person? You get killed, your game is over. It's not like you have extra lives. Plus, what's the difference between controlling a real person and controlling a CGI avatar? Much of the plot of Gamer is pretty standard. Butler eventually escapes (with the help of Alison Lohman and Ludicrous) and goes after Hall. It's certainly nothing special, but it provides a serviceable action plot. What I really did like about it is that it presents a pretty believable future world where our lives revolve around computer technology. Hell, computer technology will probably look exactly like this in less than a decade. Visually, the film is stunning. The production designer and cinematographer have done a fantastic job. I thought Gamer had one of the best trailers of 2009, but it's only because the editors of that trailer had a Hell of a great looking film to work with.",Gamer
13,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review Gamer,5,8 September 2009,"""Some of them want to use you Some of them want to get used by you Some of them want to abuse you Some of them want to be abused"" - Sweet DreamsOne wonders if social networking coupled with MMORPG similar to the likes of 3D avatar- based Second Life, would take off on an extremely large scale, with the hardware to support it, coupled with some X-factors to actually induce active participation. We know how fractured such sites and high-tech designs can be, though it didn't work against Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, famous for their Crank movies, to think up of a cautionary tale about the obsession with the virtual over what is real.Their chief villain Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall) is a Bill Gates type who made his fortune by designing two such virtual worlds with a little twist. Just like Sweet Dreams (the Eurythmics classic covered by Marilyn Manson here), his ""Society"" based MMORPG comes with real persons being that empty vessel for you to partake in various pleasures. In this reality, people pay to either be controlled - no need to think and giving up free choice, or to be the controller - presiding over the life of somebody (younger/hotter/etc) to achieve some objectives that one can only dream about. In the confines of the virtual outline, Think of it as The Sims, only that it comes complete with a living, breathing human ready to be controlled, though I do not know if everyone in the right mind would choose to be the puppet rather than the master.Then Neveldine and Taylor treaded on the more controversial aspects of their creation, that of ""Slayers"", a separate MMORPG which basically plays to our basal morbidity for gladiatorial fights. There's nothing new with this concept of course, in having death row inmates being promised freedom back into society so long as they survive long enough. It's similar to films like The Condemned and Death Race, where the wronged (played by Gerard Butler) have to find a way out of this crazy inhumane game and clear his name / rescue his family / save the day / walk the dog and preach about the dangers of technologists seducing the world with a programmable lifestyle through sexy nano-technology, while harbouring world domination ambitions via mind control and slavery.However, as the trailer would have suggested, and how the film played out its first act, it's quite a complete mess with its action sequences, with cuts so fast and furious that you wonder just exactly what's going on. Also, there's nothing not unseen from the trailer, as everything goes into this incredibly huge mess, and all the while never really permeate a feeling that Kable (Butler) the #1 killer controlled by teenage computer game whiz kid Simon (Logan Lerman) would actually be in danger. There's nothing fancy about the action here, which is a bit of a disappointment, presented in very strained colours, shaky-cam and you wonder what's being smoked during post-production.And the disappointment continues as the film shifts gear in its second half, with a backstory that is muddled and poorly presented, coupled with attempts to expand the characterization of its supporting cast, but having everything fall flat on its face. Which is somewhat of a letdown since it has recognizable faces, such as Amber Valletta as Kable's wife who works as a Society avatar controlled by a fat slob (yeah, that's the stereotypical guy who spends too much time in front of a console), Kyra Sedgwick in a completely useless role of a talkshow host, Alison Lohman, Aaron Yoo and Ludicrous being hackers of a resistance group up against Michael C. Hall's villain, John Leguizamo who's here just to talk in a strange, cryptic whisper, and the list of wasted characters go on.I felt that Michael C Hall had plenty going right for him as the twisted billionaire with a diabolical plan, somewhat psychotic and unpredictable until he became one of those weak villains who enjoys lapsing into self-important monologues with a penchant for song. Gerard Butler on the other hand, while he's not into romantic films, is perfect for one-man army type shows such as 300 and RocknRolla, such that he could jolly well be given an action figure for his foray into physically demanding roles. Logan Lerman would probably feel a little short-changed as well, being the human master of Kable with the expectation of being more than just a whiz-kid, but it was not to be, as he got pretty much forgotten for the most parts of the film.Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor hit all the right buttons with the Crank films, but fell way short with this gaming effort. Sure their elements of gratuitous nudity, sex and violence still continue into here, but in having to concentrate on those trees to draw in the crowd, they essentially sacrificed the rest of the forest, with the cast being grossly underused, the potential of being more cerebral exploring the symbiotic relationship being puppets and masters, being traded for mediocre, unexciting action sequences, and not to mention slapping in plenty of scenes just for the sake of. Those who nausea easily are warned to steer clear.",Gamer
14,siderite,What the... ? This was really bad!,5,17 December 2009,"Just to prove that once you do something good, you should switch to something else, lest you spoil it. The makers of brilliantly action packed but not taking itself seriously movie Crank are trying to do something better by using tons of special effects and referencing the computer gaming culture. What you get is a confused and pointless exercise in cinematography.Imagine The Running Man, with the same level of acting, heavily mixed with the dazed confusion of Existenz, all cranked up to 150% speed and directed by intoxicated people and you get Gamer.Too fast to identify with any of the characters, themselves reduced to a sub-cardboard level (nano-cardboard?), with a script that makes no sense and shaky headachy camera movement, I highly recommend avoiding it.",Gamer
15,KineticSeoul,Sloppy but somewhat entertaining,6,20 October 2009,"What I got from the trailer is that this movie is going to be about a big corporation that uses criminals as real life players in a interactive video game controlled by people at home. And that is exactly what it was except there wasn't enough carnage going around with the players fighting for there life cause Kable the character played by Gerard Butler doesn't do that much fighting in the interactive video game fighting for his life and you will know why if you see the movie and the movie starts to get dull with a cliché action movie ending to go with it kinda like the movie ""Condemned"" except the protagonist isn't Steve Austin. I did however enjoy the aspects of Society which is a real online dating game like Second Life and you get to control real people and dress them anyway you want and they do anything you want them to do while the people behind the control is a stereotypical gamer that just sit on there butts all day and get fat, while not having a chance in the world to hook up. What upset me the most was the ending, I thought it was building and building for a awesome finish but it just ended lame. I wish they showed more of the gaming aspects and made it into some mindless fun like the directors past movies, despite that it was energetic fun at some scenes and gamers will find some aspects of the movie to be entertaining like the T-Bag scene. Gerard Butler really carried this film, I don't think he is a phenomenal actor but he is likable.6.4/10",Gamer
16,Robert_duder,Just a solid action flick...no more and no less,8,24 November 2009,"Gamer is unique in a very important way. It is a throwback to sci-fi action flicks of the eighties where political correctness mattered little and gratuitous blood, gore and nudity meant a solid adult action flick. But now everything has to be made so everyone can see it but Gamer boldly goes where few other mainstream kick butt action flicks go nowadays. As stated by other reviewers some who hate it, some who like it, the film doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't. I would assume that anyone going to see Gamer knows that the concept of Gerard Butler being controlled in a video game like reality wouldn't be expecting the next award worthy picture for best anything. It is simply a warm blooded American action flick. It certainly brings about comparisons to past sci-fi flicks like it such as Running Man, or Death Race but the reality is it is entertainment and does exactly that for its rather short running time. Will you walk out of the theater and be over it in hours? Yes probably but the ten bucks you spend to see it will entertain you and that is okay with me. They even try to take a bit of a unique spin with added obscurity of Michael C. Hall and his ""dance number"" and certainly they keep the story running smoothly and with little to no complexity but understand that this is the style of this film and it fits what it tries to be.Gerard Butler might be shaping out to be one of the great mainstream actors of our time. He is easily one of the most well rounded actors having done everything from singing in the lead of Phantom of The Opera, to slapstick comedy, romance, cold blooded action thrillers and more. He can do everything and looks damn good doing it. He is just fun to watch, easy to cheer on even in a role such as this where he kind of the anti-hero to the story. This is definitely not a stretch for his acting abilities but he's the action hero and he works in the role. Michael C. Hall carries over his sadistic side from his enormously successful TV Series to become the jaded infamous Ken Castle, the creator of the world's most popular software that has given everyone the ability to be someone else. Hall is really underused considering his flamboyant character and how ""evil"" he is supposed to be. This isn't really a stretch for him either given the character is rather shallow and his performance is simple enough. Amber Valletta is Kabel's (Butler) estranged wife who has turned to the virtual society as a release to be something else. Valletta is a good actress, I've seen her give decent supporting performances but her character in this film is barely existent. She is there simply to further Kabel's story. Her character is very dry. Logan Lerman gives a surprisingly great performance as Kabel's player, the rich kid that is the best at the game. He isn't given a huge character but what he is given he does great at. I think he has a promising future.The film plays on a few key areas, some of which I mentioned as a warm blooded action flick full of guts and gore and nudity to appease the red blooded males that the film is geared towards. The other is of course taking the gameshow idea that was put forth in films like The Running Man, and Deathrace and mix it with the current enormous success of the video game industry and games like Call of Duty (the most recent installment broke entertainment records.) The scenes from Gamer ""in-game"" will appease any video gamers out there because it is exactly what many shooter, action games have going on. Directors Mark Neveldine, and Brian Taylor are becoming players in the action genre having worked on the Crank series (the first of which was pure high adrenaline at its best.) While their action films thus far aren't exactly deep character studies or giving us depth in the genre they know how to keep the blood pumping. When all is said and done Gamer is just exactly what you think. If you're looking a great action flick that won't cause too much thought then you will enjoy Gamer the way that I did. 8/10",Gamer
17,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A visual overload that hits hard but never engages,4,26 September 2009,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Another action thriller set in a bleak futuristic society, here where the world of fantasy and reality have become blurred and 'gamers' can now 'play' real people by virtual simulation, this has Gerard Butler as Kable, a death row convict who is the champion player where he and a group of other condemned cons must battle each other to come out on top. But some rebel fighters hack into computer systems and get the word out that they are being controlled, forcing Kable to break back into the real world and get at those responsible.The plot is similar to 90s sci-fi thrillers, such as The Lawnmower Man and Virtuosity, with it's themes of virtual reality and the real and fantasy world crossing over. It's trying to cleverly satirize the way the world is going with all things reality and just how far technology is evolving, but the overall impression is one of noise and chaos. Gamer is a none stop visual assault to the senses, with it's shaky camera and fast cuts. Everything's happening at a million miles a minute but none of it engages. Which is a shame, because the lead stars put an effort into it, including Butler doing a fine New York accent and Michael C. Hall making an edgy eccentric villain.It's loud, it's violent, it's stupid but Gamer is just no fun. It fails where Shoot 'Em Up succeeded. Even Crank. **",Gamer
18,bowmanblue,Dexter like you've never seen him before,8,22 August 2014,"Okay, I know that this is really a 'Gerard Butler' film, but you can't talk about Gamer without mentioning TV's most charming serial killer, Dexter (played by Michael C Hall). Here, we see a side of him which wouldn't be seen dead in Miami Metro PD. He talks with a southern US accent, sings and dances while he brainwashes hordes of badguys to do his bidding - he really lets his 'dark passenger' run wild! But anyway, enough of the baddie. We're really here to watch Gerard Butler as a convict who's forced to allow himself to be controlled by a computer game playing kid in a violent game of death. And it is violent.The shoot outs are pretty well done and there's plenty of action and sexual depravity to keep the (mainstream) masses amused.Don't expect too much in the way of a story or character development, but were you really thinking there would be in a Gerard Butler film (bless him)? It's style over substance. Which is a bad thing if you're looking for a deep and meaningful film. However, I was expecting rampant bloodshed and plenty of fighting and I got just that (plus Dexter behaving like he was on drugs). What more could I wish for? Well, apart from a coherent plot, but, hey, you can't have everything in life! http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Gamer
19,MLDinTN,there wasn't much to this,3,13 February 2012,"This movie was very simple and not imaginative. It was rather boring. And why was Michael C. Hall using the fakest southern accent ever? I kept seeing Dexter trying to pretend like he was from Alabama. In this movie the players are controlled by gamers. Hall is the billionaire that came up with the idea to use convicts to play real life and death games. Then people pay to control the man and try to survive. Survive 30 times and you win your freedom. So, Gerad Butler plays the most popular player and whom just needs a few more wins to be free. Some girl gives him the idea to escape, so he does and hunts down his wife and child.Most of this was just not interesting and the battles were fake looking and just not good.FINAL VERDICT: Don't waste your time.",Gamer

21,Floated2,All over the place,2,14 February 2021,"Having remembered the initial trailers of this film upon its release many years ago and thought it looked somewhat intriguing at the time. However after watching this film, it was relatively a disappointment. The story is quite confusing where it leads to questioning which was the real world and what was the video game simulation, specifically the ending. With ultimately a predictable and happy ending.The characters aren't that interesting and we don't care much to root for. Then the action and overall plot is quite boring. Gamer isn't on the level of the Crank films nor on the level of Death Race (another film with a similar feel and tone). Mainly because we are interested in those lead characters.Gamer just lacked any sort of intrigue or suspense. Gerard Butler wasn't the problem but he didn't quite elevate the film.",Gamer
22,pennyelenabooks,violence games,6,8 February 2013,"Gamer is a promising film, that from the start captures the interest of the audience with the great soundtrack and the breathtaking scenes. However as the story unfolds, you are introduced into the same pattern of action movies. The row violence and the harsh reality are overcoming the massages that the movie is to give out, such as the controlling of the mind, the dark world of the video games, the family etc. The camera shots that are too close to the face as to create the appropriate atmosphere, are getting quite annoying and boring. On the other hand, the great performances from the actors and the clever script lines are noticeable. All in all, Gamer is a futuristic film and the fans of the kind will love it.",Gamer
23,imseeg,Better play a game yourself instead of watching a failed hybrid of a game and a movie.,3,13 December 2020,"Nice try, but game over. This movie failed at choosing what it wanted to be, ending up being neither a movie, nor a game. Bummer.There are some good game styled movies out there. This one tried, but gut stuck in a game only mode, neglecting the characters. There simply is no time to learn to know any character. It is all game styled fighting scenes, with some incomprehensible talking scenes shoved in between.Even not recommended for Gerard Butler fans, because his role is small and reduced to fighting (game like) scenes only. What a mess.",Gamer
24,Vartiainen,"Interesting idea, lackluster execution",5,28 June 2014,"In the end Gamer doesn't seem to know what to do with its premise. Using death row inmates in gladiatorial video games would have allowed for some great drama as the inmates battled for their survival and their controllers dealt with the moral dilemma of using real life humans as their playthings.And we do get some of that. Unfortunately the main plot isn't interested in this basic dilemma and instead tries to be too ambitious with its villain and conflict. We really don't need a dystopian world threat with a premise such as this one. Grandeur action scenes, some good character building and a grim, dark tone would have been enough. Now it aims for too high and ends up being rather silly in the process.As for the actors, Gerald Butler is a surprisingly convincing action lead. He has the looks and the presence to play a badass and his scenes are easily the best ones in the film. The rest are a mixed package. Logan Lerman is utterly forgettable, while Michael C. Hall is an ill fit for his character. On the other hand Amber Valletta works really well as Butler's wife and a fellow virtual reality user.Gamer has its ups and downs. It provides some interesting social commentary on gaming, but its views are too few and black-n-white to really convince. It's a good first draft for a movie, but not enough work went in to really make it shine. Watch it for the action if you're going to watch it at all.",Gamer
25,Bezenby,Prepare for more motion sickness,5,23 July 2010,"Gamer, I'm afraid, is one of those more recent 'let's have an edit every three seconds and throw in loads of shaky-cam' movies. It's also pretty terrible from many angles, yet somehow manages to be watchable in spite of itself.In the near future (like all good films), an internet wizard has created sort of real life versions of Second Life and Halo, only involving real people controlled by what seems like legions of people playing online while err...knocking themselves about a bit. In the middle of all this is a game called Slayers, in which Gerald Butler is the best player, controlled by some guy, and if he makes it to thirty matches then he gets released or something. But, you know, there's problems transpiring in many forms.Like: The internet wizard has Butler's daughter. He's played by Dexter off the telly, and he is truly cringeworthy. Also, Butler's wife is a hooker on the second life thing or something, controlled by a guy in a wheelchair...Look- Gamer is one of those films where it actually leaves a bad taste IN YOUR BRAIN. Watching it is okay, but then you get up the next day and realise that half of what you've witnessed doesn't make sense. Like, how does the Slayer game work, because it look to me just like confused mess of gunfire. Or, how is Butler's character any good at anything if it's his 'controller' who been making him do everything? And why does Keith David turn up for a five minute cameo that means nothing? You could derive entertainment from this, if you don't think about it at all - Terry Crews, whom I usually like, is awful...Dexter is awful, Butler is awful but some imagery and energy keep the film from completely failing.Here's some things that it 'pays homage to': Blade Runner, Second Life, The Sims, Counter Strike, Halo, The Prisoner, The Matrix, other stuff",Gamer
26,DarkVulcan29,Escape from New York meets The Running Man,8,9 September 2009,"Gamer is a simply guilty pleasure, nothing more or less, I went in expecting an intense enjoyable action flick. This film is not for everybody, some video game fanatics will probably love it, or probably won't.Set maybe a few years from now, a popular computer game named Slayers rules the circuit, a lot of game fanatics are hooked on it. It was created by Kastle(Michael C. Hall). But unlike your typical video game, Slayers is not game you could start all over again, cause the combat and shootouts are real, and the people really do get killed. The players are people controlled by people behind the computer. Kable(Gerard Butler) is the most favorite person from the game, cause he has survived almost the whole game, he and a bunch of convicts are in the game. Kable is controlled by Simon(Logan Lehrman, Hoot). Will Kable make through the end?The film suffers from too many close ups. But it was still entertaining regardless. Gerard Butler was pretty good. But it was Michael C. Hall as the evil and sutler Kable, that pretty much took the picture. Action scenes where good also, nothing too overly done. Like I said this film is an entertaining guilty pleasure, nothing more.",Gamer
27,MBunge,Text book example of why modern American filmmaking sucks,4,18 January 2011,"In the future, Gamer should be put on display in the Smithsonian Museum. The exhibit would be titled ""Everything That Was Wrong With American Filmmaking In The Early 21st Century"".The story concerns a scientific genius who has come up with a way to make video games real. By injecting nanotechnology into people's brains, they can be controlled by other people like they were playing a video game. Instead of pushing a button and making a computer generated image jump, you push a button and make a real person jump, run, fight, have sex or do anything else you can imagine. The genius, Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall), got rich by using the technology to create a real life version of The Sims. Then he took it to the next level, getting governmental permission to use death row prisoners as characters in a new kill-or-be-killed game called Slayers. If they survive 30 battles being controlled by their players, they get set free. We join the story with one of the game characters, Kable (Gerard Butler), surviving his 27th battle. That's the closest anyone has ever come to freedom, making Kastle and the snotnose rich kid who plays him, Simon (Logan Lerman) media megastars.Now, that is a very clever idea for a story. If you think about it for just a few minutes, you could probably come up with half-a-dozen fascinating questions of domination, submission, voyeurism, celebrity, morality and the ethics of technology that could be explored in such a story. If you can do that, you're a lot smarter than the people who made this movie. Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor were totally ignorant of their story's potential because, outside of a ham handed slur on the sort of people who play video games, they make no effort whatsoever to explore any of the interesting possibilities raised by their premise. No, they just wallow around in half-baked melodrama where Ken Castle has this nefarious plot to take over the world and Kable has to escape the game and team up with a band of hackers led by rap star Ludicrous of all people to defeat him. This movie is like someone handed a one page outline of Hamlet to a 10 year old and had him write his own version of the play. It's all stupid and shallow and aggravatingly pointless.Gamer exists solely as a vehicle for graphic and imaginative depictions of people getting maimed and killed on screen. But even at that it's a failure, because it fills the screen with a tornado of camera motion and flashes of imagery where nothing is connected to anything else. The filmmakers don't know how to tell a story. They only know how to make every single image look as absolutely cool as it possibly can. Yet if every image has the same intensity, it's boring. If every image has the same meaning, then none of them really mean anything. It becomes this visual oatmeal that all tastes the same. You might start out enjoying that taste, but after a while it's like your eating nothing. With Gamer, the action is so frenetic and so kinetic that it burns out your ability to react to it. After a certain point, it's like watching static.Far too many modern films are like Gamer. The writing comes up with engaging concepts that get thrown away for whatever is cheap and easy. The direction doesn't understand the difference between a movie and a really, really long music video. These films don't so much entertain you as they pummel you with sight and sound until you're beaten into submission.Gamer isn't just a bad movie. There's something almost destructive about it. I fear that being exposed to too much of this kind of thing will degrade your intellectual and emotional development. It isn't just that only a dull witted adolescent could enjoy this film. It's that watching too many films like this will turn you into a dull witted adolescent. For your own sake, find something better to watch.",Gamer
28,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Brutal blast to the senses and current culture,8,18 September 2015,"Neveldine/Taylor's Gamer is a grim, hedonistic blast of skullcrushing action and stinging social commentary that ruthlessly indicts the technological era with tongue in cheek precision. The duo are also responsible for the Crank films, which are similarly painted in broad strokes of brash, bratty attitude and kinetic, spare no limbs violence, but are pure fun. This one keeps that vibe, darkens it just a touch, and holds up a mirror that shows a sad but all too true vision of ourselves. What's scary is that it isn't even all that exaggerated. In the near future the prison systems have been privatized by corporations, including one led by the ambitious, evil Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall, even more unhinged than on Dexter). His program uses prisoners as virtual puppets, controlled by gamers out in the real world, and stages brutal all out warfare between them, observed, bet on and obsessed over the world over, like the NFL but with lethal firepower and exploding heads. The reigning champion, Kable (Gerard Butler proves again what a wicked action leading man he is), longs for freedom, and attempts to contact his controller, a stuck up rich brat (Logan Lerman is a little ball of sleaze), in order to plan his exodus from this most extreme of sports. On the outside, Kable's wife (Amber Valetta) and young daughter appeal for his release. She ends up getting entangled in a vile, R rated version of The Sims in a delightfully repulsive sequence. Kyra Sedgwick plays a morally bankrupt reporter, Ludicrous and Alison Lohman are freedom fighters raging against the powers that be, and Zoe Bell, Terry Crews, Milo Ventimiglia (playing, I kid you not, a spandex clad video game avatar named Rick Rape), Noel Gugliuemi and John Leguizamo all make memorable appearances as well. The movie, despite being ultra fast paced and often very funny, is not lighthearted fare. The action has a jarring, repellent quality that induces cringes, but is still a ton of fun to anyone who can stomach it. The irreverent tone helps as well, with rude, unmannered character interactions and smutty dialogue reflecting the filmmakers view on our spoilt, often sickening generation. Songs like Bloodhound Gang's Bad Touch and Marilyn Manson's Sweet Dreams inject additional, welcome atmosphere into the skeezy veins running through the film. Brutal. Kinetic. Sarcastic. A whole lot of fun. And you haven't lived until you've seen Butler slam a mickey of vodka and take a leak into a vehicle's gas tank, thus furthering his escape.",Gamer
29,davispittman,What you would expect,6,23 November 2016,"There is no surprises in the 2009 movie Gamer. The action sequences and many of the scenes are pretty stereotypical for this type of movie and it's exactly what you would expect, but that doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. The film begins with a big video game style military like action sequence where a bunch of soldiers are trying to kill one another. Now there are some jerky camera movements and some of the filming is a little bit hard to follow at the beginning, but I excuse it because it's meant to be that way, since it's a game. Gerard Butler is good in his role, he was dramatic at times and then he was just the stereotypical action hero at other times. I also really liked Kyra Sedgwick in her role, she didn't really have a huge role, but I thought she fit. Logan Lerman is here, and he was OK I guess, nothing all that special, he's the teenage boy who games, and has all he could ever hope for or desire (including nude girls). That is one thing that I want to talk about, is if you are uncomfortable with occasional nudity or sex, then this is not the movie for you, because one of the games is very sexually charged and that's basically all it's about. I didn't really care to see as much nudity as was in the film, I don't mind brief nudity or a couple scenes that feature it, but I thought that they overloaded it a bit. I thought that the plot was interesting enough to keep your attention, although not the most original in the world. And this might not seem like much of a complaint to some people, but I did not care for Logan Lerman's miss use of the word gay. He uses it as an insult/derogatory term, like a stereotypical straight teenage guy, no need for that, it's insulting. Anyways back to the review. The action is all right, there definitely have been better action films and there will be better in the future. Overall I give gamer a 6/10.",Gamer
30,TdSmth5,Some good ideas but poorly filmed,6,10 September 2009,"Jail inmates participate in a brutal real-life game of Call of Duty called Slayers. But they are steered by real humans, some sad nerds playing with virtual controls. Slayers is a shooter version of another game called Society, where players create their ideal life and live out their wildest fantasies- again through real life people-turned-zombies. This is possible thanks to technology invented by an evil genius named Ken Castle- the richest and most powerful man in the world. He devised a nano-technology that allows nano-particles that receive remote controls to merge with nerve sells. The only problem is that there is a lag period between when the command is sent until the prisoner executes it. This gives them a second of free will.The game is getting to its conclusion where the most successful prisoner fighting his way to the final checkpoint would win his freedom. His name is Kable and has legions of fans worldwide. But this dystopia of corporate mind control hits a snag when hackers hack into the global telecasting of an interview with Castle. They promise to put and end to it. The hackers grab Kable. Kable's wife is one of these Society characters who plays out the fantasies of some fat kid.In the end there is a confrontation between Castle and Kable, who wants his wife and daughter back-Castle had adopted the girl.The action is shot frenetically but not very clearly. The action scenes are surprisingly unexciting as it is not clear at all who's who or what the purpose is. Who, for example, are those shooting at prisoners? Are they also remote-controlled? The scenes seem violent although there's little gore and they are filmed mostly and black/white/gray colors. The Society scenes on the other hand are colorful, goofy, bizarre, and sexually transgressive. The main story on the whole is successful and pertinent to our times as some things are said about totalitarian control, free will, the media's obsession with ratings, and the seamless unity of corporations and government. However, it's just not filmed right. The virtual control bubbles that the players use look like the way 80's movies envisioned the future. The look of the movie is purposeful no doubt but it gets in the way of the telling of the story. A more sober, less-gimmicky style would have made the movie more serious and enjoyable.",Gamer

32,Enchorde,"Good action, thin story and way too shaky camera",6,23 March 2010,"Recap: In a near future two games are on everyone's mind, Society and Slayer. Society is kind of like an advanced Sims and Slayer is like CounterStrike. But with the small difference that both now feature real humans. John Tillman aka Kable is one of the big stars of Slayer. Like all characters in Slayer he is a convicted murderer, in for life, but if he can survive the coming battles he can win his freedom. However, John knows too much about the origins to the game, and now extremely rich inventor Ken Castle is never going to let him survive.Comments: Average action that is lacking by annoying camera movement. Supposed to augment a futuristic and action filled story, but the shaky camera movement disturbs me. It steals focus from an otherwise all right story.Sure it will never win any awards for ingenuity or make a serious statement, but is quite entertaining. Mostly the action is very good, it seem like nothing has been spared on the visual and special effects, some are quite impressive. However, sometimes it seems like too much focus has been spent on the effects instead of the story. The story should carry the movie, but seems too thin at times. In fact, at a few points I felt left out by the story, like it had some major plot holes. It cleaned many of those holes up in the end, but the feeling was not good at all times.Well, I guess it turned out all right in the end. Worked well enough for an evening anyway.6/10",Gamer
33,Jonny_Numb,Plug In and Power Up,7,6 September 2009,"The duo of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor make movies that pummel, pound, and race with a freewheeling liveliness and attention-deficit style that is simply and utterly FUN. I find myself throwing out my usual stingy, nit-picking criticisms when it comes to the creators of the unapologetically sexist and blood-soaked ""Crank"" films. And their latest, ""Gamer,"" is like a cocktail of pure cane sugar and Red Bull injected right into the viewer's nervous system. In the not-so-distant future, video games have been taken the next level: instead of controlling characters on a screen, gamers command flesh-and-blood human beings whose brain cells have been spiked with the latest in nanotechnology. On one end of the spectrum, there is the candy-rave-colored ""Society"" (think ""The Sims"" with a ramped-up sleaze factor); and on the other, ""Slayers,"" an ultraviolent shooter where death row inmates are set loose in an enclosed area to annihilate anything that gets in their way. What makes this old concept seem fresh and vital (in addition to Neveldine/Taylor's starbursts of visual ingenuity) is how the phenomenon has consumed a society that gets off on the vicarious thrill of voyeuristic sex and sadistic violence, and the ironic relationships between the players and those who control them: Gerard Butler (seemingly standing in for the similarly inexpressive Jason Statham) plays Kable, the top ""Slayer"" who has seen his way through 27 of 30 deadly levels; his controller is a jaded, spoiled brat who is almost the equivalent of his celebrity (his game room is a panorama where video messages from eager groupies overlap with the gameplay); Amber Valletta plays Angie (Kable's estranged wife), who is decked out in skimpy attire on the ""Society"" set, and controlled by an obese, mouth-breathing slob. Elsewhere, billionaire game designer Ken Castle (a wonderfully over-the-top--if slightly underused--Michael C. Hall) is reaping the benefits of his creations while setting in motion his own shadowy agenda, and the anarchic underground group Humanz (headed by rapper Ludicrous) attempts to expose the slaughterhouse secret of the gaming industry to the oblivious, indulgent masses. While Neveldine/Taylor lay the groundwork for a social commentary about mankind's lust for thrills in the face of boredom, apathy, and the sloth of modern technology, they never get carried away to the point where it's a preachy downer (indeed, the exposition never goes on for too long); and while the ultraviolence directly contradicts a condemnation of such, ""Gamer"" delivers in spades on its multiplex promise: a fast, frantic, and fun flick with some food for thought thrown in.

34,questl-18592,Game On!,6,6 August 2021,"I've always weirdly enjoyed this movie. It's ridiculous, overly crass and vulgar but there's an element of over-the-top action that I like. Not to mention I think it does a pretty solid job of satirizing the more toxic elements of online communities.",Gamer
35,Sherazade,Arguably the worst film I have ever seen.,1,24 February 2010,"I don't understand why people make films like this and this one certainly made me think twice about seeing films just because somebody I like is in it. In this case, the liked party is Gerard Butler but having seen him in two disgusting clunkers back to back (The Ugly Truth and Gamer) I'm beginning to question what is it I like about him or his acting to begin with. He is currently on my nerves until he redeems himself in a better film.Okay, so about the film, it sort of follows the same storyline as 'Surrogates' but slightly tweaked. Instead of surrogates, underprivileged real humans are being used by privileged real humans for pleasure in the year 2034 via gaming consoles. The concept is so ridiculous that even I can't explain it well. Everything about this film just sucks. Big time. You've been warned.",Gamer
36,Screen_Blitz,Extremely crude and raw action thriller lacks substance,3,26 August 2015,"Director Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor brought the thrills and impressive visuals in the film Crank (2006) and its sequels. Here in this sci-fi action thriller, not so much. Set in the near-future when humans are able to control others through mind control, Michael C. Hall (Dexter) plays Ken Castle, a technological genius who runs a live-action online third-person shooter game known as ""Slayers"", where prisoners are pulled out of death row and forced to battle in a gun-blazing fight to the death; on live television. The last man left alive at the end of the game wins his freedom. Gerard Butler plays Kable, a prisoner who must fight to the end and make it out alive to get back to his wife and daughter. Logan Lerman plays Simon, a cocky, but expert gamer who controls Kable in the game. While this film follows an undoubtedly interesting premise and boasts some great action sequences, it suffers from an extreme lack of substance and execution; here is why. The plot development is very clumsy and goes in many directions it doesn't need to go. As it follows Gerard Butler's character Kable trying to make to the last round of the game, he learn that Michael C. Hall's character (the bad guy) is plotting to kill him. We are never given the motive as to why he doing it or what he wants from Kable exactly. Towards the climax, the plot transcends into this ridiculous convoluted mess where nothing makes sense anymore. As a case in point, the characters feel one- dimensional and hard to care about. Secondly, throughout the film while we are being treated with these unflinching bloody and violent shootouts, there is an unnecessary amount of sexual intercourse and nudity. Basically whats goes on in these scenes, is men and women who are sort of like avatars in the game world, flashing their breasts, flashing their bottoms, or engaging in sexual activity and what not; and it is just so unnecessary. These scenes are very misogynistic (especially with Amber Valleta's character) and are designed to just make the audiences uncomfortable. Then there are these other scenes that are just straight up perverted. It makes the movie look more like a porno. And the worst part is, the players on the outside controlling them. This film seems to aim to be more exploitative than realistic. Don't get wrong, I am have seen movies like this, but this is one just makes it unpleasant. Overall, Gamer is a bit of a mess. This film not only runs on a horrifically bad script, but is very crude, loathsome, and tries it hardest to make viewers uncomfortable. Basically, if you have a problem with extreme violence, sex, and nudity; you are definitely gonna hate this movie. Even if you are a big video game addict, you still have very little chance of enjoying this.",Gamer
37,oneguyrambling,Put the controller down - and watch a film about games.,7,8 November 2010,"Gamer was actually pretty good, not ""watch this"" good, but definitely not ""Don't watch this"" bad.Now there is a back-handed wishy-washy recommendation if I ever saw one.If you are a little confused or on the fence I'll start by saying this; Gamer has the most instances of gratuitous T&A in any movie I have seen for years this side of soft porn.In Gamer video game development has real people being ""played"" as characters in games. The controller is normally an everyday person, the controlee is usually a criminal (for violent games where there is a good chance they will die) or an actor (for games like The Sims).The creator of this new wave of games is named Ken Castle, we meet him early on being interviewed by a talk show host played by Keira Sedgewick, Castle is normally reclusive and enigmatic, but due to his creation he is one of the most famous and wealthiest men on the planet.(An aside, almost every character in Gamer has a filthy mouth, but every time Ms Sedgewick did the same I thought ""Geez you didn't need to say that."" Maybe she just projects the Mum vibe... or maybe I am just getting old.) Castle's initial creation is a real life ""Sims"" universe named ""Society"", controllers can either play as a character reminiscent of themselves (like in Surrogates), or create a character to their specifications. Going by what you know (or think you know) about video game junkies, what do you think most do? So what we have is a bunch of fat guys sitting in their lounge rooms using a proxy to chat up characters created by other fat guys sitting in their lounge rooms and propositioning them for random sex, using their thumbs that are coating the joystick with Cheeto dust and chicken grease - only the actors being controlled are often made to do things against their will for money.Sort of like a snuff film or porn.Predictably enough, as anyone who has played the Sims knows, you can only spend so much time before you get bored, (11 minutes for me) and get the urge to shoot at things, so Castle developed more games.In one of the most popular games worldwide called Slayers, Gerard Butler plays one of the most successful controlees named Kable (with a ""K""), his controller is a young precocious (read arrogant) whippersnapper named Simon.Slayers puts all the characters at one communal point of a ""stage"", then has them run the gauntlet to a safe point at the end of the stage. Those that die are out, those that make it to the safe point live to fight another day.Apparently the goal is to survive for so many stages that you are released and absolved of your crimes. In a real life situation Simon's successful character Kable becomes much sought after due to his proficiency in the Slayers' Universe, and Simon fields many offers to take over control of Kable, some financial, others more immediate and - um - pleasing? Kable is very close to reaching the required number of stages, no-one has gotten this close before and he has a dedicated fan base urging him on as he moves towards his goal and freedom.In a situation very reminiscent of The Running Man Castle decides he can't afford to let Kable win and decides to ""tip the scales"", Kable decides that his best chance is to get Simon to relinquish control of him to allow him to do what he does best and survive the final battle, as Simon's controls cause Kable to pause at ties which often leave him very vulnerable to attack.Similar to Surrogates there is the Resistance fighters who need to show the world that all is not well, including the militant black leader (this time it is Ludicrous), and this time they have the catchy gamer tag of the ""Humanz"", anyone who comes up with the name Humanz and thinks ""Yep that's cool, that'll do"", should hand back their marketing degree and walk outside to deal with the real world.The guy playing Castle is as hammy as most video game characters but is definitely entertaining, there are many other recognizable actors that are in and out of the story without ever having much impact, primarily John Leguizamo whose role seems to be talking to Kable and saying the blindingly obvious to remind the audience of what the stakes are.As mentioned the action moves at a frenetic pace, there is much colour and eye candy and some over the top stunts and FX, being a video game movie obviously allows the filmmakers to deliberately turn the volume up to 11 and the realism down to 0, which lends itself to a pretty entertaining movie.Gerard Butler does his best Jason Statham impression as the guy who is steely eyed and determined without ever really doing much acting. In fact this entire movie is strongly reminiscent of Statham's Crank movie, and would be well packaged as a set with the two Crank movies and Shoot ""em Up. Perhaps the distributors can market it as the ""European actors acting stoic and shooting a bunch of people in hilariously outrageous ways"" box set? Gamer is not a film aiming at Award's season, nor was it trying to pander to critics, it is a fun film that aimed at a younger audience looking for a little more than a Transformers sell out.And with that in mind I think it is quite successful.Final Rating – 7 / 10. Always frenetic, at times inspired lunacy. If over the top action and constant movement are your go, play a game. (Then watch this while you ice your thumbs.) P.S. Enjoy the 12 minutes of credits!

38,Sirus_the_Virus,The best part: In the beginning where they showed trailers.,2,25 October 2009,"Gerard Butler stars in Gamer, the worst film of the year. I was forced to sit through this crap though I didn't want to. The story itself is kind of interesting. But the film, it was just so wrong. Everything about this movie was a mess. It has mindless action, horrible acting, and the movie is just weird. Nobody wants to see a naked fat guy controlling a chick and having her get raped. I told you the movie was wrong. The film takes place in a futuristic world. In which people are controlled by other people like in a video game. It's a survival game. A person has to get through thirty deadly matches before they are not controlled. Kable(played by Gerard Butler)actually gets out. Even after the creator of the program(played by Michael C. Hall) hires a tough guy to kill him so then he can't get out. He has done that to every person because he wants to control them. But Kable gets out, and starts doing a bunch of stuff, including trying to find his wife. Now as I said the plot of the film is kind of interesting. But the movie is just plain stupid. The film has appearances by John Leguizamo and even Allison Lohman. Kyra Sedwick also stars as a talk show host. The moments with those stars actually had me interested. But the film was really stupid. This movie is just a dragging mess. That is the last time I will ever let my sister choose a movie again. Oh my god this movie was so horrible. I originally thought Land of the lost was the worst movie of the year. But it is official. Gamer is the most dreadful movie of the year. They could've done it a lot better because it had a good story. Instead, they made it blow. This is a game I would never rent. I was happy when the game was over.

It's an actor-turned-filmmaker, a good job of eliciting strong performances from his actors. Ultimately, however, Gone Baby Gone is not more than an interesting story told exceedingly well but there's little doubt (actually no doubt) that the movie's thought-provoking conclusion is destined to leave viewers thinking and talking long after the end credits.

The screenplay and characters are written very well. Although there's an excessive usage of shakycam effect during the action sequences that produces a distracting effect, it doesn't really affect the fun quotient this nonstop action film has to offer. Gerard Butler's performance is terrific and he plays his part very well. Same for the rest of the cast.I was kinda surprised but not shocked to realize that this film was made by the makers of the classic actioner Crank starring Jason Statham. The camerawork, loud action and several uncomfortable moments alone confirm this. At times resembling a real video game, Gamer is loaded with extremely violent action, has sex/nudity and has swearing too. That being said, it's definitely not for kids.

43,MrGKB,An energetic failure...,5,1 August 2010,"...that adds very little to the genre of dystopian sci-fi parables beyond a syrupy dose of action, gore, nudity, and pseudo-commentary. In fact, the only stand-out bit of business is a satirical song-and-dance routine as the film approaches ""Game Over"" status, which might have been triumphantly effective had the rest of the film supported it.Gerard ""300"" Butler does what he can to establish a sympathetic lead, and the ensemble backing him up is competent enough (and it's kind of fun trying to spot all the cameo appearances from various genre stars), but the threadbare plot veers wildly from seriousness to satire to arcade-style mayhem and back again, never allowing ""Gamer"" to transcend its action film roots and gain footing within the ranks of far better cautionary tales like Norman Jewison's 1975 classic ""Rollerball."" Writer/directors Mark ""Crash"" Neveldine and Brian ""ditto"" Taylor score a few telling shots against corporate fascism, media prostitution, and the ovine nature of the masses, but none of it really clicks. We've seen and heard all of this before.Beyond which, the premise of ""Gamer"" is, to be kind, somewhat dodgy. Never mind the absurdity of nanotech gizmos replacing brain cells to enable mind control, stop and consider for just a moment or two the unlikelihood of even coddled masses cheering on a puppet. It makes no sense; they would cheer the controller, not the controlled. ""Gamer"" ignores this completely, along with niceties like why controlling players have no apparent interest in preserving their automatons, opting instead for rash headlong assaults into withering fire (and let us not dwell on how such fusillades seem incapable of hitting our erstwhile ""hero""), and an apparent utter inability to co-ordinate with other players on their ""side"" of the mêlée.In short, despite its obvious technological prowess (including first use of a new lightweight digital camera) and various fillips of socio-commentary, ""Gamer"" pretty much dispenses with the rules that define ""willing suspension of disbelief"" and renders itself as little more than a cinematic exercise in replicating 1st-person shooter video games. As such, it makes itself prime video fodder and little else. If ""Gamer"" weren't so technically proficient, I'd rate it even lower.",Gamer

And lastly the stupid song and dance routine at the end is the dog muck flavoured icing on the cake.

Beefcake Gerard Butler is once again a muscled non-entity, the poor man's Stallone. Valletta, who unsurprisingly manages to be believable when her character goes into ""glassy-eyed automaton"" mode, is otherwise terrible. The talented Michael C.

47,ajs-10,Good for the first half...,6,15 August 2010,"I think at some point everybody has had a go at playing a computer game. You know, you take control of a character on a screen and make them run and jump, or you interact with other characters in some kind of simulation or you are fighting a war where you are one of the soldiers. Well, imagine doing all that but rather than just moving a bunch of pixels around a screen, you actually control a real person. This is the future of gaming that is possible with the use of Nanex, a system that, once injected into the brain, replicates itself and allows the subject to be controlled with software. Imagine a world addicted to games like this and you are in the world of Gamer.Originally thought up by multi-billionaire Ken Castle, who came out with his first game, 'Society' in 2010 (according to the script). Now, 'Society' is a simulation where people can interact with each other in a world populated by people who have been injected with Nanex. They are willing participants and are paid to take part. Now, Castle's next project proved to be more challenging. A war simulation called 'Slayer' where convicts on death row can gain freedom if they can make it through thirty levels of the game. Enter John Tillman (a.k.a. Kabel), who has already got through 27 levels and is nearing the ultimate goal and freedom. He has a wife and daughter outside who he is desperate to see since, yes you guessed it, he's innocent of the crime he was convicted for. A gang of radicals contact Kabel and tell him they want to help him. Can he get out of the game before he is killed? Well, I'm not going to tell you here I'm afraid.This is an interesting film for the first half and then it kind of loses a lot of its appeal. There are some great stunts and some really cool CGI work and even some very interesting scenes, but ultimately the plot lets it down. Decent performances all round, although nobody really stood out. So, honourable mentions go to; Gerard Butler as Kabel / John Tillman, Amber Valletta as Angie, Michael C. Hall (also Dexter on TV) as Ken Castle, Kyra Sedgwick as Gina Parker Smith, Logan Lerman as Simon Silverton and also nice to see cameos from John de Lancie as the Chief of Staff and John Leguizamo as Freak.As I have already said, this film was quite interesting and absorbing for the first half but then it loses a lot of momentum and kind of drifts to an unsatisfying conclusion. The action sequences are particularly graphic and very well executed, but ultimately the weak ending lets it down for me. Worth seeing for the first half then, but ultimately disappointing and so, not really recommended.My score: 5.7/10",Gamer

""Gamer"" has got none of the above. It's as mindless as it gets. The story is ridiculous. The action is badly filmed. The whole thing is as entertaining as watching paint dry. At times, the movie is almost hilariously bad. Why do the directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor insist on making the bad guys sing and dance all the time? It's not exactly a ""bada55"" thing to do, is it? And why does the movie in its final moment think it's ""Blade Runner"" all of a sudden, ending with almost the exact same camera movement as Ridley Scott's, hm, slightly better motion picture?

Other movies in the genre were LOADS better",2,12 September 2009,"Funnily, the movie does verge toward something interesting and possibly intriguing at two or three places. But alas--- nothing whatsoever came of any of that, and the plot simply oozed on, spreading outwards like the sludge from a spilt toxic waste barrel.All of the movie's concepts and plot points were covered loads better in earlier films. Not least is the old Arnold Schwartzenegger ""Running Man."" That was a popcorn trifle, to be sure, but nonetheless pretty novel and very good at the time. Even last year's ""Death Race,"" the EXACT same concept, was done much, much better, and was in fact a minor work of art for those into the genre.The trailers for ""Gamer,"" heck, even the title of this movie were clear: this was a movie immersed in the action and feel of a young kid's violent hand-held video game. Duh... I thought, though, that perhaps there was some kind of story underneath it all. I thought surely there is some redeeming value here. Perhaps it was one of those ""world view"" treatises that explores alternate realities or something. Wrong. I should known better. Thsis movie was so chock-full of junky violent effects, most of them of a mediocre quality, that it was nothing but a storm of 14 year-old boys' fantasies. I had them when I was 14. I am way past that now, thus the movie was just dull and stupid from my viewing perspective.I am not upset that such violent trash gets made. Different strokes for different folks, etc. But unless you are someone who truly enjoys going to Monster Truck demolition derbies, swerve your car to actually HIT squirrels in the roadway, or spend virtually every waking moment slack-jawed and drooling whilst furiously clicking away on your Gameboy (or whatever is cool these days), I urge you to save your time and your money, and avoid this messy, blurry, extremely nervous and vapid exercise.Let me make it even clearer: this film is badly made. My objection to it is not the plot, nor the characters nor the theme. Rather I object to the fact that it is crap, in my view.

Normally this would cause a movie to sink like a rock, but individual scenes in ""Gamer"" are entertaining enough alone that actually doesn't matter.""Gamer"" tells the story (or tries to) of a death row inmate renamed Kable (Gerard Butler) who is in the middle of a game where he is fighting to survive. Think of it as a live action version of Call of Duty Modern Warfare on Xbox Live, except that when you die in the game, you die in real life. Anyway, the catch is that his movements are being controlled by a kid named Simon (Logan Lerman). Also in the mix are his wife, Angie (Amber Valetta), the games creator, Ken Castle (Michael C.

Also in the mix are the Humanz (led by Ludicrous), who are hackers who are also trying to stop the game, a morbidly obese man playing Castle's first game, ""Society,"" and a few other assorted plot lines. The story is incoherent, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining.It's hard to address the acting in this film...no one has enough time to put on a performance. Everyone does their part adequately, although Michael C. Hall is clearly enjoying himself as the megalomaniac with no conscience. He's a lot of fun to watch.Neveldine and Taylor are known for their over-the-top action movies. They made ""Crank"" and its sequel (unseen by me), and they make Michael Bay look like a poser.

I found myself changing the volume between action and story scenes. It was like Crank (2006) but trying to be serious. It mostly worked. There were some really dry areas. The action was pretty cool. The ending too was an interesting story. The main bad guy was cool. Somehow the whole thing didn't really work and was a touch boring. It was nowhere near as memorable as The Matrix (1999).

55,blackmamba99971,Well it could have been better,3,24 January 2010,"I like Gerard Butler, but this movie was not the kind I imagined. Now the premise is using prisoners as Icons or Avatars for people involved with a game that harnesses Nanytes in each of the cons minds. Once the Nanytes replicate, they become as one with the mind. Thus the user for that particular Icon/Avatar can play a deadly game called slayers. Yet this film was way too convoluted to be desired, it took weird twists and turns that made absolutely no sense. Public sex, public domination in a place called society, where men and women would live out THE most obscene fantasy you could ever dream up. And Castle, the mastermind of such a device using people to degrees for his benefit. But in all of this, Cable (Butler) was to find his daughter before one prisoner who was not infected with the Nanytes was going to kill her and his wife. I can see that part of the story making sense, but with everything else it seemed it was too drastic and fast to comprehend. I suppose the writer was thinking of how this earth is going to such a place little by little until it would become so saturated, that no one would see the difference. Violence would become a mainstay in life, sex in public places would be second nature, and living to see prisoners kill each other although I don't think anybody would really disagree on that part, most criminals today are so beyond help, that the public would think it would be doing them a favour. But all in all, it was okay, lot of blood and gore, but realistically, it was to acid edge of a movie to be believed. I hope in the future the director can tame it down a few notches.",Gamer
56,drpainters,Cool concept and some decent parts,6,14 February 2021,Just poorly directed and edited. Movie is kind of just a mess and story is all over the place.

57,kirk-246,A couple good actors in 1 bad movie.,5,7 August 2010,"Wow, I was really disappointed in this movie.From the trailers, this looks like a hard-core action movie that promises graphic violence and maybe good performances.At least the violence is graphic.Everything else is pretty much rubbish.I liked Gerard butler in underrated movies like ""The Ugly Truth"" and ""Law Abiding Citizen"". Allison Lohman was terrific in ""Drag Me To Hell"". Ludicrous is a good rapper.All of these people are in the wrong movie.Gerard Butler is the main character yet there's no humanism in his character.He seems like he never wanted to do this role but only accepted it for money.Money is 1 waste this movie offers.It offers poor performances, uninteresting story, and Terry Crews.What happened Terry? You were great in movies like ""Idiocracy"" and even ""White Chicks"" and now you should be ashamed of yourself.""Gamer"" is simply a waste of 85 minutes and good actors.It had potential, but it just sucked.It could make a cool video game, but as a movie, it's a real let down.I pray to God and Hollywood that there will be no ""Gamer 2"".",Gamer
58,xamtaro,"One of the Best video game movies, ironically NOT based on an existing video game",7,26 November 2009,"I was expecting this movie to be nothing more than pure action. Just watch, have fun and forget. Gamer, however, proved to be a huge surprise and a lot more than i expected.For starters, Gamer is far from a mindless action flick. If anything it hearkens back to the late 80s where films were exceedingly violent and there was this obsession with futuristic settings and dystopian societies(remember Robocop, Total Recall, Blade Runner etc). Great to see that genre getting a revival.Couple of parallels can be noticed between this and a number of other movies. Particularly Paul WS Anderson's ""Death Race"" and ""The Condemded"" which starred Stone Cold Steve Austin. Gamer's Premise about a wrongly accused criminal forced to take part in a ""game"" that is popular worldwide would no doubt cause an uproar of about how this movie lacks originality.But who cares, this film delivers what one would expect from any first person shooter video game: non-stop action. The action is relentless and fast paced, though some viewers would be turned off by the erratic camera motions, whip pans and weird angles. Depending on the individual's taste, that style of filming would actually serves to increase the intensity and frantic feel of each action scene. Video game fans would no doubt agree that some of the First person combat footage scenes beats the crap out of the highly publicized 10 minute FPS scene in the 2005's ""DOOM"" movie.Sadly, the acting was not really up to scratch, especially from Gerald butler. Gerald Butler is not a terrible actor judging from his previous starring roles. Maybe it was just how he was told to portray his character or the script he was given, but the acting was a little disappointing. Then again, its the future, a future where the general populace is so desensitized to violence that they may be a little less emotional than people in the present. In that case, much of the ""flat"" acting is negligible since it merely serves to better portray this dystopian society and how far humankind has fallen.What stood out most was the implied messages and underlying themes of this film. It is like a cautionary tale about where our society may be heading . Themes about corporations controlling the people, desensitization to media violence, a downward spiral into decadence, and a world where the media is gaining a greater dominance over the minds of the youth are ALL spliced into the movie and, thankfully, come across as only implied and in no way ""preachy"".""Gamer"" is a movie that delivers subtle, thought provoking social commentary while mixing it up with full on fighting, bloody gory action and a simple enough story to follow. This movie follows in the proud tradition of the many classics of the dystopian future/action genre; Its got both brawn and brain, though it may lack ""heart"". Video game addicts, action junkies and adrenaline pumped young adults will be able to enjoy this film very much. Also The more learned crowd like university students would be able to discuss the many social issues that this movie brings to light.",Gamer
59,richard_sleboe,Mind control isn't what it used to be,3,18 January 2010,"This movie doesn't trust its own story. It just heaps images on images and effects on effects. To make things worse, there is not even a consistent visual style. Movies like William Harrison's ""Rollerball"", Daniel Minahan's ""Series 7"", Mamoru Oshii's ""Avalon"", or Kathryn Bigelow's ""Strange Days"" provide a much more substantial and coherent view of what happens when virtual reality and real-life commercial interests collide. Having said that, there's nothing wrong with Amber Valetta's shapely behind displayed in bikini bottoms, although I think she has more class than the makers of ""Gamer"" can handle. They have her play a first-person prostitute, renting out her body as a remote-controlled avatar made of flesh and blood. The other reason to go see the movie anyway is Michael Hall's eerie performance of ""I've got you under my skin"" with a chorus line of cybernetic ghouls dancing along. But that's only 2 minutes out of 95, and I think most people won't find it worth the wait.",Gamer
60,NoArrow,Neveldine and Taylor succeed on the strength of their images,9,7 February 2010,"Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor's ""Gamer"" had a near-mystical effect on me that I'd liken to Bigelow's ""Strange Days,"" Bergman's ""Fanny and Alexander,"" Fellini's post-8½ stuff and most of the work by David Cronenberg. What I mean is I was disturbed – in the most viscerally enjoyable way.The plot's your run-of-the-mill dose of futurism/cynicism. In America, in the future, death row inmates are controlled via nanobots in their brains by ""gamers"" for the purposes of a Pay-Per-View combat game called ""Slayers."" The inmates are hauled to these deserted cities or warehouses and basically act as avatars – these settings bear a close resemblance in design to popular first person shooter games like ""Halo."" None of the obstacles exist for any reason other than ducking behind to avoid the shrapnel/splatter of exploding bodies.In the ""real world"" the gamers game and millions of viewers tune in to watch the latest match. Kable (Gerard Butler) – played by Simon (Logan Lerman) – is the undefeated champion. A few more victorious rounds and he'll be set free. He'd be the first. So there you have the basic plot – it's not wholly unique. What differentiates the movie from garbage like ""Death Race"" is the style and wit that's put into the images (and their implications). The sequences that take place in ""Slayers"" are brilliant in how they depict existing video games – yes, in the movie these are real people getting blown apart, but it all looks the same to the viewer, so what's the difference?These are the sort of questions Neveldine and Taylor are asking, as they did with their equally brilliant ""Crank 2."" They don't have any answers. Indeed, they tell their satiric/violent stories with an unbridled joy some would mistake for hypocrisy. It's not. Neveldine and Taylor are the voice of their generation, evaluating their detached, sadistic tastes while exploiting them to the enth degree. They're not making excuses for themselves, they're just being honest. It's to their credit their movies can be pulpy, exciting action yarns while sending themselves up so cleverly.Even more interesting and visually brilliant than the ""Slayers"" sequences are those set in ""Society,"" a Sims-like game where players utilize the same technology to control human beings in ultra-exaggerated social settings. The players are seen in dark rooms, getting their throws while their far more beautiful avatars engage in endless sex and partying in the ""Society"" universe. I can't properly describe in words how disturbing this is, you have to see it for yourself.What the film satirizes most efficiently is our mindless mass servitude to the latest technologies. We don't think about implications, or slippery slopes, we just slide down them – and faster and faster, the movie surmises. This leads to interesting anomalies, like Hackman (Terry Crews), a roid-raged maniac who joins ""Slayers"" ""with no strings,"" simply, because he wants to. Also, there's a monstrous fat man who seems to sit in his apartment endlessly playing ""Society,"" with Kable's wife (Amber Valetta) as his avatar. These two characters' first meeting provides the film's most repugnant moment. None of this comes off as particularly outlandish.It's the Valetta character that provides the suspense of the film, which has a pretty standard story. It won't spoil too much to say that Butler escapes, hooks up with some revolutionaries (the ""Humanz,"" who don't escape the film's satire either) and fights his way to the top: ""Slayers"" and ""Society"" creator Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). Hey, it's an action movie. But at the same time, it's not.An action movie is about choreography, stunts. This movie has that, but the engine that drives it is the cinematography – the same could be said for the ""Crank"" films. It's the camera work and editing (a lot of it) that gives the movie its forward energy. You get caught up in it. There's probably a few hundred shots, and they're all – all – thought-out. They're connected with what came before and pull you into what comes next. This sort of visual dynamism in a B-movie is like taking a breath of fresh air after a decade of ""Saws"" and ""Saw"" cousins.What can I say? Like the best movies, it wraps you up, wrings you out, and you're better off for it.9/10",Gamer
61,Jackpollins,"The weirdest movie ever made, and an enjoyable film",8,5 September 2009,"Going into Gamer, I was expecting a straight action-thriller. Weirdly, I was expecting wrong. Yes, Gamer does have a huge amount of violence and thrills, but the film goes into a strange satire of sorts in which people are controlled by people playing video games. A hot woman is controlled by a 2,000 pound guy and an ugly man is controlled by a hot woman. I was strangely delighted by this, though. Yes, Gerard Butler stars as Kabel in a dark action-thriller a lot of the time, but Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall) is the source of the satire. He created the world ""society"" where everyone is controlled by a video game player. This movie is like The Running Man hopped up on Red Bull. It's bright, colorful, and fun, but then dark, weird, and thrilling. The movie is ultimately a film that knows you're gonna enjoy them juggling two complete different plots, so they do. The film makers put in weird but noble effort, and a cast of very good people like John Leguizamo and Kyra Sedgwick are in it. Expect to be confused, expect for it to be stupid, expect for it to be weird, but definitely see it nonetheless.",Gamer

However, the execution was absolutely terrible and as a result the whole film failed completely to deliver.It looks cheap as well: the special effects are not very well done and the film is one of the worst where I saw this actor, Gerard Butler, one. He made some very interesting films, such as 300, but overall, this film only stained his career.I also should note that users here are quite easily impressed, in this case, by it's dystopian view of the future: some claiming it made this a highly ""stimulating"" film, well, people, lets act like grownups: just because it is supposed to portrait a dystopian world doesn't mean it is a masterpiece, if the execution is terrible.",Gamer
65,squirrel_burst,"Bordering on offensive, this movie wags its finger at the audience",2,28 March 2015,"""Gamer"" is a mean-spirited, misogynist, poorly edited and poorly shot action film. The characters are cliché and the world the story is set in so vaguely defined that it's impossible to understand what is going on. I'm not usually one to criticize a film for feeling familiar because if you look deeply enough, a lot of people take inspiration from myths or common story elements, but when your movie brings in nothing new and doesn't even feel like it's trying, I call foul.The film is set in 2024. The gaming industry has been revolutionized because now, instead of playing regular video games people can command prisoners to fight to the death in a ""real life"" video game called Slayers. If you don't feel like having convicts fight each other to the death? Well that's OK because you can also have other human beings dance around, perform dangerous stunts, have gratuitous sex or embarrass each other in a tamer game called ""Society"" where poor people get paid to have their bodies controlled by others. Our hero is John ""Kable"" Tillman (Gerard Butler), the most popular pawn in the game of Slayers. There's something sinister about this futuristic society, and if the probably evil Castle (Michael C. Hall) is to be taken down, Kable will have to take control of his own body! What irritated me about this picture is that the story just feels like an excuse to have stuff happen. Really important elements of this world are never explained, they're just there and you have to take for granted that it works the way it does. I don't mean in the same way that a far-out premise like say... ""The Running Man"" either. I'm talking about stuff that could plausibly happen but is presented in a way that makes no sense. For example, the rules or goals of the Slayers game are never established. What is the objective of the game? Do the slayers have to run to a shelter before they are killed? Do you have to murder a certain amount of people? Is there a time limit? You never find out. How has Slayers revolutionized video games anyways? It's not like the players can feel what their convicts can feel, and games can't be started at any time of the day (they're televised) so how is a video game that you can pick up for cheaper, play at any time not strictly better? This is a tale that doesn't care about explaining anything or developing the world it's set in so it's really hard to care about anything that's going on. Stuff just happens so that we can have people kill each other.I'll give the movie this: if the objective was to make a game that feels like a deplorable video game, mission accomplished! The characters actually feel like video game personalities because your immediate impression of them is everything that defines them. The villain is very obviously evil (even though it's supposed to be a mystery) for example and he does that typical thing that every bad villain does in a bad action movie. I'm just saying that you would never see Mr. Glass from ""Unbreakable"" pick a fight with Arnold Schwarzenegger because one is a brainy villain, the other is an action hero... but that doesn't stop our Machiavellian sociopath! Kable isn't any better. He's set up as a killer but anyone with half a brain can see that this is once again, one of these movies where our anti-hero isn't an actual anti hero, he's just a good guy that's been misunderstood. Nearly every other character is totally disposable, and not the least bit memorable. Unless they're a woman because those are all killed or sexually exploited by the time the credits roll. Females in ""Gamer"" are more like props than actual people. I was actually really disturbed by some of the events in the film. Want a hint of some of the distasteful developments? How about I give you an easy one: there's a character called ""Rick Rape"" in the ""tamer"" Society game! There are a few scenes that have good action segments and there are a couple of laughs here and there but there's no real audience for this movie. You would think that this action film would be made to cater to video game enthusiasts, but they're all portrayed as unlikeable sexual deviants that would willingly sexually assault or murder human beings for kicks. ""Gamer"" goes out of its way to show how horrible it is to get entertainment out of seeing human beings being killed, so people who revel in violence and gore (fans of action or horror movies) won't get much entertainment out of this lecture either. There's no need to see this when there are actual good movies based on the same concept easily available. I came to thoroughly hate ""Gamer"". (Dvd, July 14, 2012)",Gamer
66,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,Neveldine/Taylor do it again.,7,4 September 2009,"""Gamer"" really isn't a movie of a lot of depth, nor is it a movie that requires a ton of thought. In fact, overthinking this one may cause you to like it less, because when it comes down to it, ""Gamer"" is another typical Neveldine/Taylor product that goes balls out to get the crowd engaged and entertained. If you want mindless, unrealistic, futuristic sci-fi ridiculousness, look no further than this one. However, I never said this was a bad thing.Is ""Gamer"" going to surprise you with any twists? Nah. Is ""Gamer"" going to go beyond its extremely generic sounding title to provide the viewer with a completely ridiculous ride that's at least worth laughing at? You bet. Like ""Crank"" before it, ""Gamer"" prides itself on being as much fun as it can. I found that it started off pretty slow, trying to develop as many characters as it could, when it really didn't need to. The film bears obvious stylistic imprints of its creators (raves, strip clubs, gratuitous nudity, and bright colors), who are really two of the biggest examples of escapist, and flat out ridiculous modern film-making.Despite how easy it is to describe Neveldine/Taylor's films, there is a noticeable difference here...That would be the strength of the actor in the lead role. Jason Statham is flat out incredible in the ""Crank"" series. His Chev Chelios is really one of the most ridiculously hilarious and awesome action heroes around. The same can't be said for Gerard Butler's dull and uncharismatic performance as Kable. I really felt like he was just here for a paycheck, not absorbing himself in the world of Neveldine/Taylor the way other actors like Statham and Amy Smart have...and trust me, there's plenty here that feel completely at ease in this world, none moreso than the phenomenal Michael C. Hall. You know what I'd really LOVE to see? A movie where Statham's Chelios takes on Hall's Ken Castle. That would be a freakin' amazing movie. Hall's over the top and incredibly unrestrained performance has got to be amongst the most fun to watch of the year. I really can't give him enough praise for just taking the role and running with it. Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges fits his part well enough, while it was funny to see Milo Ventimiglia in one of the most hilariously bad cameos of all time. Terry Crews played an interesting part, while I'm still coming to grips with the fact that Kyra Sedgewick was in this movie.First off, don't take ""Gamer"" seriously, because it'll only hinder your viewing experience. That's what it's really made to be...an experience. It's got good-not-great action, some witty one liners from Michael C. Hall that are to be cherished forever, as he simply steals every scene he's in, including the end. I thought the concept of the movie was cool enough to work as a film, but the major selling point for me was the presence of the Neveldine/Taylor names, as they really don't hold back when making their movies, and that's part of what makes their work so entertaining.",Gamer
67,Jerique,Combine The Matrix and Surrogates?,7,5 December 2009,"It seems like they took pieces of The Matrix and the plot of Surrogates and mashed the two films together. The film blasts out the gate with a wicked intro where Kable (Gerard Butler) wins his 27th consecutive session of Slayers. If he survives three more, he will be released from the game and subsequently prison.It's a cool concept and I like how the game plays out on screen and how it's a virtual reality type game. However, there's a truckload of errors in the gaming world and the plot is filled with flaws. It's quite confusing, at times, and would be difficult for a teenage audience to comprehend.Special effects are phenomenal and grasp you from the start. It's nearly a 100% action film saved for maybe a couple minutes of tender scenes and sexual scenes with Amber Valletta.The movie is also laced with similarities to the inferior The Condemned starring Stone Cold Steve Austin. Although I haven't read the book, Ender's Game, also sounds like it got thrown into the plot of Gamer as well.It's an awesome action movie, but really all it is another kick-em and shoot-em up Gerard Butler movie. It's not that I despise Butler, but I'm kinda getting sick of watching him be the hero. Can we get a new one? It's a good movie to watch.

70,RichardSRussell-1,"Clever, imaginative ideas ruined by terrible execution",4,5 September 2009,"Gamer (R, 1:31) — SF, 2nd string, originalClever, imaginative ideas ruined by terrible execution.The basic plot device is already familiar from The Condemned (2007, 5) and Death Race (2008, 2) — convicted killers given a long shot at freedom if they can manage to survive a death match broadcast to a jaded, worldwide audience desensitized to actual violence after decades of exposure to the artificial kind. And, once again, not only are the visible odds stacked against the protagonist (only 1 survives out of the 10-12 who begin), but so are the invisible ones: The contest organizers, for nefarious motives, can't afford to let even the victor escape to the outside world.I classified those 2 previous films as ""borderline"", because there was nothing in the science per se that was outside the realm of current technology. Gamer, however, spills over into pure SF due to its innovative wrinkle: The combatants are being ""run"" by video gamers by means of nano-adapted, radio-receptive brain cells.The film opens with a bang, as we follow Gerard Butler's John Tillman — game ID Kable: Killer — thru a mind-numbing, colorless, staticky, urban-decayed, 1st-person-shooter sequence. Our 1st clue as to the deeper nature of the situation occurs as Kable momentarily seeks cover behind a steel post and whispers ""Turn me around."". And here is where the genius of the plot should have planted a seed that would fully flower by film's end. Most of Kable's actions are directly controlled by his player, 17-year-old Simon Silverton (Logan Lerman), but his senses and some of his volition remain his own, perhaps dependent on the amount of will power he can muster up at any given time. There is a tension here that, properly developed, could have formed a better basis for the ultimate resolution (which, to give it due credit, depends on quick wit and verbalizing instead of more mindless violence).Tillman survives the opening shootout, his 27th mission. (He gets out after 30.) Only at this point does the film's total freneticity slow to merely jumbled and confused. It is a temporary respite. During the occasional lulls, we get to meet Ken Castle, the Bill Gates of his era. He's portrayed by Michael C. Hall, who raised cheerful sociopathy to an art form as the socially responsible serial killer in Showtime's Dexter, and he does nothing here to stave off typecasting for the rest of his career.Castle was the computer genius who invented Society, a MMORPG that introduced the nano- control technology to the world by means of letting its subscribers run actors thru their paces in a Second Life milieu. Tillman's lovelorn wife Angie (Amber Valletta) has taken a job as one such character, and it's clearly taken a toll on her. Society is Stage 1, still active, still lively, garishly colorful, and we spend some time there. Stage 2 is Slayers, the monochrome combat game in which Kable is embedded, clearly more World of Warcraft than Second Life, and we spend lots of time there. Stage 3, revealed near the denouement, is something secret and sinister; suffice it to say that I'm no longer all that reassured by Larry and Sergey's motto of ""Don't be evil."".So, smart plot. Here comes the ""but"".In addition to the kind of wildly scrambled scenes, moving too fast to follow, that this summer's testofests Transformers and G. I. Joe have already beaten us over the head with, Gamer adds quick leaps back and forth between the live action and the video coverage of it. It's a doctoral dissertation acted out by 5th-grade boys who've discovered a truckload of lightsabers and methamphetamine.The cast looks impressive, but like the rest of the film it's all superficial. Kyra Sedgwick, John Leguizamo, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, John de Lancie, Milo Ventimiglia, and Alison Lohman blink on and off screen as if slumming or perhaps bobbing for paychecks. Butler gets more face time, but as a unidimensional grunt he starts with almost no audience appeal and isn't given an opportunity to develop any.So how did such good ideas go so wrong in the realization? Do the writers, Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, have a legitimate gripe against the director for spoiling their vision? No, because it's the self-same Neveldine/Taylor who get the directing credit, so you have to assume that this WAS their vision.Time to visit a good ophthalmologist.",Gamer

Here, people control other people (death row inmates) in a battle of life or death-and by that, I mean you really control them. The most popular man in this game is Kable (Gerard Butler), who manages to gain independence. Can he regain his family and defeat Castle? I knew going in that ""Gamer"" wasn't going to be ""Crank 3."" That out of the way, much of what made the ""Crank"" movies so great is missing here, replaced by a preachy demeanor and attempts at commenting of society, as well as action movies and video game culture as a whole. That's not to say there aren't inspired moments (a song and dance number near the end is the biggest highlight), it's just that after ""Crank"" and it's sequel, the humor and inventiveness is largely absent, instead replaced by a plot done by films like ""The Running Man"" and ""The Condemned"", only it's not as good as the former and at least better than the latter. Also, while I'm all for gratuitousness in movies, here it just feels tacked on and lazy, as if it's an afterthought. The action scenes are plentiful, but unfortunately, begin to become repetitive and almost mechanical at times.Acting wise, Michael C. Hall steals the show and seems to be having a lot of fun in his role as the villain Ken Castle. Terry Crews is a lot of fun too, and Kyra Sedgwick is good. Gerard Butler isn't bad, though the movie doesn't really ask him to do a whole lot except glower and fight. Alison Lohman, who was great in ""Drag Me To Hell"" is awful here, while Ludicrus gives a dull performance that reeks of him wondering ""What the hell am I doing here? Oh yeah I'm getting paid."" In the end, while it has it's moments, and while I wasn't expecting another ""Crank"" like movie, ""Gamer"" is one of the years most disappointing movies-no, not one of the worst, but most disappointing-in that it lacks much of what made Neveldine and Taylor's previous films so fun.

74,pontram,Thought-provoking Action Flick (can that be ?),8,16 January 2010,"Here we have the rare case of a restless Action stunner with socio-critical approaches, like killing people in video-games or faking online-identities. It is only a continuation of what happens in children's rooms every day, when they fight as soldiers against others in all those shooters. What if the world behind their consoles is real, and their avatars are dying for real ? Nothing nearer than making an action movie like Gamer from this.And it suggests, that there could be no real difference between operating virtual or human avatars - if the latter decided freely for being operated (as opposed to: being on death row). I felt several deja-vues watching the film, beginning with Crank 2 for the visuals, but also at the end Kung Fu Hustle, which has a big reminiscence there (the dancing scene, I can't really figure out why they made it !). The Society/Slayers aspect is much more Rollerball than Running man.I enjoyed the Society game scenes, as I disliked the Slayers', because I'm not a fan of senseless shootouts, even when they make sense in the context like here. I was impressed by the scenes where Slayers comes to Societies and the poor Avatars have no chance than being helplessly slaughtered, because there is no danger for their controllers. What would we feel when we are in grave danger, but cannot - even try to - escape because we aren't the masters of our own bodies ? Reality is what man/woman wants to escape and so we use our technology if we have enough money. The Society-avatars are the poor and unemployed, selling their bodies as a chance to survive. Like in every chat-room you don't know the real persons behind the controller - so the movie gives us some clichés like the fat and immovably man, who controls women for sexual arousal, and the small young boy, who is the world's leading Slayer fighter - without risking a fingernail in his fights.The package of ""Gamer"" is not flawless. There could be a much more intelligent plot than the usual 'taking hostage of poor little daughter' and the usual 'wannabe world controlling villain', or the needless Ping issue, or the complete inefficient try to give us an insight into the gladiator's lifes, to make us familiar with their poor souls - at this point the movie isn't as 'cool' as it wants to be. And there could be a better main actor, but I see, Bruce wasn't available...On the other hand, ""Gamer"" shines between its flaws with freshening cynicism, and the most presumable approach, to which extremes a future entertainment industry could go. Unlike ""Surrogates"", where the people live their life with avatars, and the only effect is that they become lonely, where in ""Gamers"" they loose their humanity. Which seems more likely to me.Considering the many topics brought together in this movie, as violence in games, social disparity, government arbitrariness, inter-human isolation, and so on, I think that ""Gamer"" is quite unique, together with ""District 9"" from the same year. In reckless exploring some abysses of both our bright presence and future.",Gamer
75,plasticanimalz,A Bad Verahoven,3,1 April 2012,"The concept is interesting. The film is not completely unwatchable, like 'Jonah Hex,' but I don't know if I would go as far to say it's entertaining. I wanted to see who wrote this, because it's written at the level of a teenager. A bit over the top and ridiculous, and not what anyone would actually say in real life. It's like a comic book version of real life written by people who don't actually engage in life. I was surprised to find out the team that wrote and directed this film is verging on their '40s. They are clearly trying to be like Paul Verahoven, in their directing, they just do a really bad job of it. The plot is pretty flimsy. I get the impression that they're trying to be the next 'Matrix,' with the whole cyber people on the inside, but it really comes off more like 'Hackers.' After 'Jonah Hex' and 'Red Riding Hood' being the worst films I've seen this year, I'd have to say this film ranks in after those.The writing is better than the directing, which isn't saying much. The acting is terrible, and normally these actors are pretty good. Michael C. Hall is a great actor but his character is so ridiculous and the directing so terrible, he should get a razzy for that performance. The Milo cameo is also ridiculous. 'Rick Rape?' Seriously? That's a character name? Not that I've ever thought Milo is a great actor but he's been directed to be so ridiculous that it becomes laughable.As I watch the film my rating for it keeps going down. This writing/directing team make the 'Independence Day' team look good. Though, Emmrich has at least redeemed himself with some decent films since they broke off their team efforts.Some people just shouldn't be given budgets.",Gamer
76,Benjamin_Cox,"Grim, depressing and brutally violent - 61%",6,8 November 2011,"Another graduate from the school of ""high-budget, low-brow action movies"" (also known as ""Crank"" College) is this effort, which at least offers an interesting sci-fi twist to proceedings. The other thing I found interesting was that the philosophy behind such movies is to emulate video games and none more so than this. The trouble is, any statements about the impact of gaming and social networking is lost amid the bullets, bombs and blood.Sometime in the future, mankind is obsessed with a new sort of gaming. Using technology invented by media mogul and multi-billionaire Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall), violent criminals known as Slayers are pitched against each other in a nightmarish battle where their actions are dictated remotely by unknown people. One such Slayer, known as Kable (Gerard Butler), is only three battles away from winning his freedom thanks to his controller Simon (Logan Lerman). But Kable has plans of his own - he just wants to clear his name and recover his wife (Amber Valletta) and daughter. But with Castle determined to keep control, and a mysterious hacker group launching cyber attacks against the system, what chance does Kable actually have? I'm not normally one to get turned off by violence in movies but ""Gamer"" really does take things to extremes - gore, limbs and organs splatter all over the shop amid the explosions and chaos. Such visual nastiness doesn't really allow Butler much scope for any acting quality but at least he looks the part. Hall is much better but sadly, isn't on screen that much. The action scenes are what most viewers will want to tune in for and these are well-shot, visually exciting and actually feel like a video game. Like ""Crank"", the film's adrenaline-fuelled action really delivers. But whereas ""Crank"" is a laugh, ""Gamer"" is grim and depressing and I struggled to enjoy this movie as much.If it were a bit lighter and not reliant on brutal violence, frequent nudity and an oddly old-fashioned view of the future (think Day-Glo colours and ""Blade Runner""-inspired fashions) then ""Gamer"" might have scored higher. As it is, I found it a tad repetitive after a while and felt like I needed a shower afterwards. It isn't a pleasurable experience and personally, that's one of the most important things I look for in a film. If you're looking for excessive violence and a thrilling, body-filled blast then this will probably float your boat. But assuming that you're not a teenage boy obsessed with ""Call Of Duty"" then this will go down as a wasted opportunity. The questions it tries to raise about how we live our lives and the direction we're heading in as a society are swept under the blood-stained carpet and replaced with yet more bloodied corpses. A pity.",Gamer
77,cadillac20,Decent adrenaline rush with an interesting sci-fi twist,6,4 September 2009,"The previews of Gamer didn't terribly appeal to me. However, after reading some initial reviews and seeing that the people over at Joblo found it to be pretty decent, I thought I would check it out. Was it what I thought it would be? Kind of. Was it entertaining? Sure.Gamer is, first and foremost, mostly a brainless action film in the vein of Crank and other hyperkinetic actioneers, which is presented in fast, somewhat jittery cuts. There's plenty of ultraviolence here and a world of uber-tech that revolves around mind control and the next phase in adult entertainment. While the premise seems a bit silly, with some people subjecting themselves to more demeaning elements, it is a bit thought provoking, which is kind of nice in an action film. It does edge close to Schwarzenegger's Running Man, although this film stands on its own with a stern Gerard Butler and over-the-top Michael C Hall.Still, you can't help but feel detached from everything. The film rushes itself, finally slowing down to a decent pace at the end, with an ending that is very fitting and entertaining. However, most of it is a mix between speedy action and lackluster dramatic scenes. Why Leguizamo is in this film, I have no clue. There is enough action and techno-gunk here, however, to make for an entertaining 90 minutes. There's also plenty of T&A, which is rare in films these days, although I found most of it to be not veyr attractive. The interesting thing is that the film does do a good job of creating a world that could potentially exist. No matter how disturbing some elements in the film may be, they seem to have an air of truth, and that elevates this film just-above-average.Although it is certainly a film with many short comings, it's entertaining and presents an interesting world with some scary realizations. Let us hope that, in our lifetime, we don't see this sort of thing happen.",Gamer
78,The_Dead_See,A warning to those who dislike ADHD music video directing and editing.,2,6 February 2010,"The first run around, I turned Gamer off after thirty minutes. The directing and editing was so bad - with no single shot seeming to last for more than half a second - that I could barely follow the story and found the action unintelligible and boring. It is shot like a 2-hour long music video. No establishing shots, nothing subtle, rapid-fire editing, overuse of shaky-cam and not one single shot that isn't angled weird or pointing up someone's nose.Only three movies I can recall had directing and editing this distracting, annoying, and self-congratulating. Those were Catwoman (04), Vidocq (01), and Transporter 3 (08). If you could handle those movies then you might enjoy Gamer.So yes, I turned it off, but then I decided to review it anyway to perhaps save a few folks like me (people who can't stand this new era of ADHD movie directing) some time. So the next day, I sat down and suffered through the last two thirds. And yes ""suffer"" is the right word.It's a pity as I see it. Michael C Hall was a fabulous bad guy. Gerard Butler is a tried and tested action hero. The concept and script weren't altogether losses. But boy do these directors (yes, it took TWO of them to make something this awful) need to get over themselves and learn how to visually tell a story without getting in the way of it. It worked for Crank because the style matched the frantic subject matter and almost became part of the theme of that movie. It DOES NOT work with Gamer.You know, I used to think Uwe Boll or McG, or perhaps Michael Bay were the worst directors in Hollywood today. Now I'm revising my opinion... Neveldine/Taylor take that dubious honor.",Gamer
79,piratecannon,Game Over,2,27 December 2012,"Even though it's filled with cheesy dialogue and is based on a completely unbelievable premise, The Running Man is one of those lovable but stupid sci-fi actioners that I absolutely have to watch anytime I see it on TV. When I first saw the trailer for Gerard Butler's new vehicle Gamer, I thought, ""You know, I'm sure this is going to be complete garbage, but because it looks like The Running Man, there's a chance that it'll be chock full of cartoonish violence and nifty one- liners. That makes it at least worth the price of a matinée, right?""Wrong.I have no doubt that directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor think their movie is rife with timely commentary regarding the popularity of violent video games and the boom of social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter. It's clear that the absurd amount of debauchery the directorial duo has managed to stuff into the 95-minute runtime of Gamer is all there for a purpose—at times to do nothing more than make us gag—but the whole thing comes off as being a forced exercise in ""gore and weird camera angles are the best way to get the point across."" It's almost as if the pair wanted to see how much they could make the audience squirm, as little things like plot, character development, or any sort of emotional investment are completely shirked in light of a much bigger task—namely, to simultaneously bore us, confuse us, and make us shake our heads at the sheer stupidity of it all.The story is this: a tycoon by the name of Ken Castle has invented a type of nanotechnology that replaces normal human brain tissue with robotic cells that are designed to receive transmissions. In short, people are able to control other people in the form of a violent ""video game"" called Slayer (although Castle made his first billion with a Sims- esque endeavor titled Society, where real people control other real people who do things like walk around in circles, touch each others' breasts, wear leather jumpsuits, etc.). Much like last year's Death Race, the story centers on an inmate whose trying to survive long enough to escape and finally be reunited with his family. As things progress, we're provided with a few details regarding why Kable (our hero, played by Butler) was imprisoned in the first place, and once the whole thing takes the predictable government conspiracy/he's-been-framed/yada, yada, yada route, we all know exactly what's going to happen.Unlike the self-aware/oft-comedic pieces of science fiction that literally poured out of the 80s, Gamer doesn't seem to understand that it's premise is ridiculous (nevermind that the aforementioned Society, Castle's original claim to fame, has apparently been around since 2010). Gamer tries desperately to make connections to the present, even going so far as to duplicate a certain unmentionable maneuver found in Halo 3 that players often subject downed opponents to (if you've played Halo 3 online, you know exactly what I'm talking about, but, in an effort to maintain some degree of class, I'll avoid actually saying the word). There are even times where it seems as if Gamer is patting itself on the back because of a clever plot development—or at least something it thinks is a clever plot development—which ends up being, in fact, completely illogical.Point in case: in an attempt to escape the confines of the Slayer gaming field, Kable decides to chug a bottle of vodka before a match. After managing to separate himself from the rest of the pack (forget how conveniently this is accomplished), he finds n abandoned truck that runs on ethanol. He gags himself so he'll puke the alcohol-laden contents of his stomach into the fuel tank. When he's finished this, he then stands up and drunkenly urinates into the tank. Since the automobile is now filled with his urine-ahol, it instantly cranks up.Let's take a second to think about this.I'm not a mechanic, but I'm willing to guess that ethanol cars run on a fuel mixture that's a little more complex than just vodka (especially vodka that's been processed through someone's digestive system in less than 15 minutes). The real problem with this particular scenario, however, is that Kable could've easily entered the playing field with the bottle of vodka hidden underneath his flak jacket. For some inexplicable reason, he decides to down it in front of a security camera as all of the other players are running out to join the game. Why wouldn't he choose to remain sober and make his way to the abandoned parking deck, thereby drastically lowering his chances of being killed?Really, I could go on and on about the logical inconsistencies in Gamer— which, quite honestly, wouldn't be so glaring if the movie didn't regard itself as a poignant metaphor about where society is headed—but I won't do that. The ominous, flickering end screen says it best: GAME OVER.",Gamer
80,liberalgems,A Blood & Guts Cautionary Tale!,5,6 September 2009,"I honestly tried to figure out what Gamer was all about minutes before the film started to roll at my local theater! Since I was not successful, I decided to throw caution to the wind, and pluck my $10.00 down and give it a try. What I ended up seeing was - on one level - a glorified video game - and didn't take too much effort to figure out the ending half way through the movie! There was also so much gruesome violence that I closed my eyes through about half of Gamer. The only thing holding my attention was that I really wanted to see the story's hero win in a big way. The reason for 5 stars instead of 1. Despite all the violence and plot holes you could drive a tracker trailer through, the acting has heart, which made Gamer mildly entertaining.But most importantly - Gamer is a cautionary tale about both the potential dangers of future breakthroughs in nanotechnology and brain implants. Already scientists have had some breakthroughs with brainwave technology for the severely disabled - something I support 100%. But we live in a capitalist society where huge corporations will do anything to make money unless there is government intervention to protect public safety. The world of Gamer is the logical conclusion of what happens when our government fails to do it's job of protecting us from evil!",Gamer
81,MovieZoo,Gamer: Ms Pacman wouldn't even plink,5,4 September 2009,"This is definitely one of those movies that will appeal mainly, if not only, to the gamer-nauts out there. Action packed and bloody as can be, the movie takes wild aim at trying to appear thoughtful and logical. As I should have known, it went way off track by trying to be anything but an adrenalin addict's dream come true.Where love exists in one man's heart, fear will also live. In this movie, I fail to feel the compassion. Even at the hands of a man who somehow took control of the lives of not only his family, but the lives of millions(maybe billions), one man manages to challenge the head evil doer while outwitting one other who poses a threat to Mr Castle(head evil doer) who owns and dictates his followers(basically a herd of super charged tech support team). Mr Kable (Mr Butler) plays his part very well, being a huge threat to Castle, but is no competition for bad movies.Skip this and save your money for the game world. Virtually 5 out of 10 because I didn't care one way or the other.",Gamer
82,moviemaniac008,Not great but delivers what it was meant to deliver and actually entertains!,8,6 October 2009,"Now I won't go calling Gamer a waste of time, because I have to admit that the movie is very entertaining. But however, I cannot go calling Gamer the best movie ever because it has many flaws. Gamer stars Gerard Butler as Kable/John Tillman, a man who is in prison for murder. He plays a game called Slayers (in fact he's the main star of the game), a video game in which convicts are controlled via computers to play in a killzone-like type of multiplayer battlefield. Win 30 games and you're free. Problem? Nobody ever made it to 30 games, and Kable knows it...so he plans to escape, however, upon his escape from the game he discovers that many things have changed: his daughter has been taken by child services and his wife is now a pawn for Society, a sims like type of game featuring real people.Gerard Butler offers a good performance, in fact, he was great as Kable. However most of the other actors were bad. Still it's awesome to watch any movie starring Ludicrous, he brings a special touch to certain characters. Aaron Yoo is very funny like always but this role just didn't seem fit for him. The script is also written in a funny way, it's pretty hard to understand but once you can follow the beat of the movie than it's easier to understand. The action scenes were just breathtaking, and no kidding, they were awesome! Still I would advise you to wait for the DVD, in case there are some parts of the movie you would be missing.P-S: The ending sucked, but the rest of the movie was pretty darn good: only problem is that the movie looks a lot like death race without the race.",Gamer

84,andrewmerritt-31652,A mess between video game and a twisted version of Sims,6,27 January 2019,"Gamer stars Gerald Butler and Michael C. Hall and Gerald Butler has to survive thirty rounds of a virtual reality game called Slayers in order to see his wife and daughter again. From what I described about the plot there wasn't much to it other than you have your typical movement who's looking to bring Michael C. Hall to justice that's it. This is weird I mean really weird like imagine the writers and the director did a bunch of bath salts and crystal meth. They did have an idea of what this would be about, but then thy forgot they were making a movie and said you know what lest make this as trippy as possible and the story well half-ass it. To me what interested me was the twisted version of Sims world then Gerald Butler being in your typical Halo and Call of Duty video game simulator. Everyone involved making this seemed to put a lot of effort in the Sims world then the rest of the movie they read half of Brave New World and 1984, and now we have this mess. Nothing is concrete the characters are one dimensional, typical, and your average stereotype. The only one who does a good job of holding this together is Michael C. Hall, the eccentric, crazy, over the top performance who is the creator of Slayers and Society (the twisted version of Sims I mentioned). As I mentioned before if they focused on Society more, then I would be down to see how this plays out, but they went for the ladder and that's what made this tumble to the ground. So overall, the movie is interesting to look at, but don't expect too much.",Gamer
85,movieman89-2,What a load of rubbish,1,27 September 2009,"I did read comments about it before seeing it, and heard that it was bad. I went to the movies to see it a few nights ago with a friend. I have to say I agree with the bad comments.The story went OK at first but then just got completely random and made no sense. Afterwords I had t ask my friend 'is this in the real world or is it the game?'. We need more explaining about everything.There was no connection with the characters and we didn't know anything about them.The filming and the editing was terrible thought out the action scenes, I thought I was getting a headache. I thought I was watching Quantam of Solace (which was also rubbish).I have found out the most stupid scene of all the film I watched in my lifetime. The main character downed a bottle of vodka before fighting. He goes to a car during the action, I throws up in the fuel tank and urinates in it and the car somehow works!, how stupid is that? Even the after the ending was done, I asked myself 'what was that all about?' I don't mind Gerard Butler but I thought his acting was dull in this. I cant say much about the others because again we don't know anything of the characters.I preferred the trailers before the film started.I wouldn't recommend this it all, I would rather rent it on DVD when it's out.",Gamer

Even if I did not recognise the plot as a retread of the infinitely better The Running Man, what the heck is this modern trend for shooting an entire movie in what almost black and white (with some red thrown in so that the splatter shows up)?This was random, disjointed, and extremely hard to follow when in 'Game' mode.Then someone burst into song. That was the point where everything slipped off the cliff edge and went into freefall for me.The 3 I give this movie is for the potential of the idea. But having TV's Dexter vamp it up as a megalomaniac billionaire computer 'hacker', running a sort of living, breathing Sim City, where stereotypical (loser) gamers squat in the dark making their controlled avatars do some pretty unspeakable things, coupled with the singing psycho with the Pinocchio fetish and it's a big NO from me.",Gamer
87,Mihnea_aka_Pitbull,A chaotic sort of Matrix spin-off,4,21 September 2009,"The subject is offering - but the way of making it true, sorely lacking...! The main flaw is the lack of consistency of ALL characters - these two guys don't know that you need CREDIBLE FLESHY HUMANS to make a story engaging? Then, the script is over-messy, way too dense for most of the audience, crowding together much too many plots, facts and details, right from the beginning, to allow a normal breathing for the narrative - and, when we come at last to make some sense out of it, it simply falls flat: another plot to conquer the world by manipulating politicians and dignitaries - this time, via web games! It's simply too little, for such a laborious effort.Further, all the storyline (and the way of shooting it) is so packed with action, tension and gory show-off (plus the legitimate special effects), that it keeps from start to end ""right under the ceiling"" - and the effects is disappointingly anticlimactic: the Sandman comes to your eyelids around the 15th minute into the show, and will never leave again till the end!

90,brownah18,Control a human criminal to win him his freedom!,8,30 December 2009,"In the near future, billionaire Michael C. Hall (Ken Castle) is the creator of a new online source of entertainment called Slayers in which a gamer controls an inmate from prison through missions to eliminate other inmates to win the goal of their freedom. Hot shot gamer Logan Lerman (Simon) controls the inmate Gerard Butler (Kable) who is close to winning the last five games to win his inmates release, when finding out a way to talk to the inmate from an unknown opposing group led by Humanz Brother (Ludacris).The Sci-fi fantasy of the creation of this movie is so unique that it is exciting to watch as much as it is hard to believe. The graphics as well as the special effects make this movie worth the watch as well. Buff guy Butler plays the tough guy role so well as you have seen before in his movie 300. Lerman is quick becoming a big actor and this was somewhat of a big role for him, like a stepping stone for something bigger hopefully. In some instances it feels like they played this movie off of Death Race with Jason Statham just to try and out do it by making this film better than the release of that was. It seems like planting a microchip into a human brain is a big what if in this film, along with other films I have recently seen that are unrealistic. Ones definition to predict the future is unknown, but to create their own version of what could happen kind of gives you something to go off of to make you thoughts wander.",Gamer
91,wlee08,Stunning,9,7 January 2012,"I suppose Gamer resembles that Schwarzenegger movie, the one where the men must fight for survival on a game show like futuristic gladiators. Gamer takes this idea further by immersing real people into the virtual battleground. But what is most fascinating is the state of real society as it relates to new technology. There's a lot of black humor - probably a little darker than most people are comfortable with. There's also a lot of graphic violence. This is a selfish future, where a free-for-all, apathetic cultural mentality predominates, and this can be more disturbing than violence. But I liked the way the movie was able to cross these lines and leave the viewer disturbed and uncomfortable. The visuals are incredible. Expect superior quality effects and brilliant camera angles. By applying the technical visual aspects from the gaming world to the movie screen, this movie may have set an important landmark for future action films.",Gamer

93,LadyLiberty,Gamer offers no winners,3,7 September 2009,"Okay, before we begin, allow me to confess to some bias here: I love Gerard Butler. I would pay to watch him eat cookies. And you all likely already know that I'm something of a sci fi geek. That's why it pains me so deeply to say that Gamer is so bad.Gamer takes place sometime in the near future. The man who invented a technology permitting people to be controlled as avatars is Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). As a result, he's both unthinkably rich and has an ego to match. His new game, entitled Slayer, is a phenomenon. That's why television reporter Gina Parker Smith (Kyra Sedgwick) is so thrilled to get an interview with Castle.During the interview, we learn Slayer features death row inmates as avatars. They volunteer because they'll be set free if they can win 30 battles. The players gain fame and perhaps fortune. The government goes along with it because the money generated foots the bill for the entire overcrowded prison system.The best Slayer player in the world is a 17 year-old named Simon (Logan Lerman). His avatar is a prisoner called Kable (Gerard Butler). The fact that the two have managed to win 27 bloody battles to date makes them a massive audience draw, and it gives Kable a degree of fame he can't imagine. Simon unsurprisingly enjoys the notoriety immensely. Kable only wants to get back to his wife (Amber Valeletta) and child.But there's more to the game and the technology than meets the eye. A group of computer hackers known only as Humanz led by a man calling himself Brother (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) is determined to not only manipulate the game, but to tell the world what's really going on.Gamer was written and directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (the same two men who brought you Crank and Crank: High Voltage). I loved the story's premise, but I hated the script. It was disjointed and far too stylized. And while I'm as much a fan of hand-held cameras as anybody, it was overkill here, and then combined with what amounted to a strobe effect as the screen flashed split seconds of disparate scenes. While these things can be very effective and provide unique perspectives, too much of a good thing is, well, just too much.The actors weren't bad, but they were given little to work with. Butler was extraordinarily limited with few lines; I know he's capable of more emotion than he showed here, so even his most poignant scenes were apparently stripped of almost all feeling by the directors. Sedgwick was so exaggerated as a character that she was cartoonish, so much so that her character didn't mesh well with the grit of so much else. Can Valeletta act? I have no idea because she really didn't act at all here nor did it appear that she was supposed to.The only person who really came off well from an acting standpoint is Michael C. Hall. He gave Ken Castle just the right amount of creepy, and more than enough narcissism to showcase a man I suspect none of us would really want to know no matter how much fame or fortune he accrued.Thanks to the frenetic edits, I can't even say how good the cinematography might otherwise have been. The battle scenes had real potential—the sets were very much similar to our existing knowledge of shoot 'em up video games, only far dirtier and frankly more believable—but the edits were so quick and disjointed that I didn't get a chance to appreciate the view. The same is true for some very gruesome special effects. Were they bloody? Yeah, I think so, because the camera was splashed a few times. But I had so little vested in so many characters, and saw so little of their fates, that I had a hard time caring.BOTTOM LINE: That last phrase pretty much sums up my opinion of Gamer: I didn't care. Under normal circumstances, I walk out of the theatre and like to think about the movie. What did I like? What didn't I like? What will I write about? This weekend, I walked out of the theatre and, as usual, headed for a late night grocery shopping trip. I was at the store and halfway through with my shopping list before I realized I hadn't thought about Gamer once. That, my friends, is not good.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Gamer is rated R for ""frenetic sequences of strong brutal violence throughout, sexual content, nudity and language."" The R rating is warranted, but even if it weren't, Gamer is so difficult at times to follow that younger kids won't get it anyway. As for older kids, I was so turned off by the movie myself that I actually asked a few young men who were in this movie's target demographic what they thought. Apparently, I think like a 20 year-old guy because they were significantly less than impressed as well.POLITICAL NOTES: Those people who want to see more and more control from the government might be surprised to learn just how far such a government will go when it finds itself in need of funding, or when it learns it's overwhelmed in one facet of control or another. While the plot of Gamer can't be entirely attributed to government intervention at an earlier place or time, it's easy enough to see what might have happened to bring society to that point. Certainly it's made obvious that some salient parts of the story line owe themselves to the government as well as the unvarnished desire for control. My own take on stories of this nature is that we need to consider how technologies might be abused before we jump wholesale into how they might be used.",Gamer
94,riteshshergill,Why did they lose their way making this one?,5,21 November 2009,"It started out alright, the premise is good but what starts with a bang ends with a whimper. Its almost as if they lost interest after making the first few scenes of the movie. Sure they've tried to make it Uber Cool but the rest.. disappointing. I get irritated when people loose their way while making a movie. Gerard Butler is a convicted felon controlled in an arena by a superstar gamer. Somebody hacks the program to allow Butler to go free. From thereon, this could've been one kickass movie. Too bad the director lost interest. It was almost as if the Director had let the Actors roam free. I wish I were a writer. I wanna write a story for this one.",Gamer
95,loogenhausen,Now You're Playing With Butler...,6,30 November 2011,"Neveldine and Taylor take a step backwards after their outrageously entertaining Crank 2. However, Gamer is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It is, though, nothing to write home about and begins and ends without too much fuss. The main drawback of Gamer is the same issue that plagues a lot of modern movies - it can't decide on what it wants to be. Topical sci-fi? Pulse-pounding action extravaganza? A sly, satirical mix of both a la Verhoeven? Gamer is none of these. It wants to be all of them and fails, unfortunately. That's not to say it isn't entertaining and it's still leaps and bounds better as brainless time-killer filler than something like the abominable Transformers 2. Gerard Butler is serviceable as he always is, but it's Michael C. Hall that saves the movie from being one hundred percent forgettable. Although his villainous character is written to be an unoriginal bore, Hall injects the role with a crazy energy that makes the finale much better than the nice-looking but slapdash beginning and middle battles. Boasting a great concept, Neveldine and Taylor are like Logan Lerman's gamer kid Scott and the movie is like Butler's character Kable - except that Neveldine and Taylor aren't as good as the gamer kid when it comes to controlling things. On a side note, the basic plot of this movie is exactly the same as Jason Statham's Death Race. The only difference is that Death Race has no pretensions about what it is while Gamer does. Pity...",Gamer

How did Gerard Butler and Michael Hall look at this script and say, ""Yeah, I want to do this!""? Maybe they were being controlled, much like most of the characters in this movie.Maybe I'm being a little unfair. If you're under the age of 3 or have severe ADD, you might like this movie. I don't think there's a cut longer than 5 seconds.But aside from the idiotic plot and lightning-fast editing of this film, there is one little--make that microscopic--gem in this: a fight set to ""I've Got You Under My Skin"". That could be a potential MTV Movie Award Nominee for Best Fight.There is one scene in this film that sums it up very nicely. In order to fuel up a truck with an empty gas tank, Gerard Butler vomits--but wait, there's more!--and then urinates into the tank in order to make it run.A vehicle running on vomit and urine. Yeah, that sounds about right...",Gamer
98,rjyelverton,Criticizing violence while reveling in it,5,8 September 2009,"""Gamer"" employs a fence-sitting plot of many exploitation films that both bemoans dehumanizing violence and revels in it. In the future, we force our death row inmates to participate in violent games in order to entertain us and possibly secure their freedom. Director(s) Neveldine/Taylor (""Crank"" and ""Crank: High Voltage"") like so many exploitation filmmakers before them reveal the inherent evil of the system by focusing their film on a noble participant (Gerard Butler) wrongly accused and framed by the system. So maybe letting death row inmates kill each other isn't so bad--look at all the neat explosions and kill shots--but it's certainly bad in the instances when it snags a hero and a family man. We don't need a more humane outlook on justice. Just better quality control.But the co-directors do add an interesting, if unpleasant, wrinkle in the film's subplot which follows the hero's wife and her participation in ""The Sims""-like game Society. Society allows players to select a living, breathing avatar to exploit in whatever way they see fit--usually sexual escapades. Like the violent game in which the hero participates, the film both revels in the prurient results as well as criticizes them. These scenes, however, are so unsettling and vile--particularly the site of a nearly naked morbidly obese laughing at the pain he inflicts from afar--that the film seems to more successfully execute a critical position by making us sick to our stomachs. Engaging in the exploitation here makes the viewer queasy and more than a little guilty, sad.The directors jettison their soapbox in the climax, however, which gives the villain his violent comeuppance while the whole world/movie-going audience watches and cheers. The message: Enjoying violence is okay as long as its victims are bad people. This moral is as old as the cave walls, but Neveldine/Taylor seem prepared to criticize this position by making a film that is so disturbing as to wake us to our willingness to dehumanize in the name of entertainment and the pursuit of justice. But they throw this all out the window in the end and reveal that the prurience was the point, an end unto itself, and what we're rewarded for the price of admission.",Gamer
99,moviesaccordingtodes,Gamer toyed with my mind,7,21 October 2010,I was pretty impressed by Gamer. Not only was I in awe on the action scenes but the idea of this was so futuristic yet original. It took something like the SIMS game to a whole new level.With the way technology is taking over I would not be surprised if something along the lines of the two games featured in Gamer eventually become a reality.Gerard Butler was his rugged and awesome kick-ass self as always.Gamer was thoroughly entertaining and surprisingly thought provoking. It actually provoked a large discussion/debate with a group of friends.Fascinating topic.,Gamer
100,gabridl,degeneration,3,5 September 2009,"I thought ""Crank"" was silly enough to be fun, and for that I was willing to suspend my irritation at ""Gamer""'s thefts from ""Rollerball,"" ""Running Man,"" ""Strange Days,"" and other dystopian B movies with the rationalization that a film about simulated realities was obviously alluding to the other examples of the genre. But ""Gamer"" isn't even this self-aware. What starts as a meditation on Hegel's master/slave dialectic degenerates into Marcusian conspiracies of how capitalism is equivalent to pornography and from there into the even more primitive territory of the Puritan hatred of sin. It is as if the writers of the film felt that rolling the clock back through variants of American cultural critique all the way to the Colonial era was somehow the best way for their viewers to feel what it must be like for evil nanocells to take over their minds. It didn't work. ""Gamer"" is just dumb. Oh, and what happened to color? Does everything have to look like you're about to pass out?",Gamer
101,neacorp,Its offensively stereotypical,1,12 September 2009,"I must say I play videogames, I go to work, I have friends with who I hang out outside of my house, I'm not perfect and was offended by this movie.I have no idea what the creators thought to achieve with this, but a film with so many stereotypes and big explosions is testing the audience tolerance limits. I guess Hollywood only plays Team Fortress and Halo skirmishes, never hearing of a single player mode where you try to avoid problems just to finish it. Though the film tries to portray how bad the entertainment businesses are, it fails by being too ridiculous. Oh, and did I mention it takes the word ""slavery"" to the next level, with the entire world loving this travesty? Get ready for a roller-coaster of redundant plot holes.To cut the story short, the military invents unstable mind control, but shuts it down. Chief scientist resurrects it on his own to sell and makes a business empire as a front to take over the world. Prime unit escapes, exposes the plan to takeover the world and kills the scientist for revenge. Wow, how original. And the ending doesn't explain anything; it's a classic ""driving away with the family"" that tells noting about the damage done or what will follow. Ugh.Let's hypothetically say you acquire a way to control people actions like video game characters. What would you do with this tech? Waste it on videogames or make people just give you money for no reason? Why not go and take over the world one man at a time? Why would you complicate things by selling it to retarded people? Any army in the world would pay you more for this tech as well as give you subjects to install it in. And while we are on the subject of soldiers, how many times do you normally die in a first person shooter game if you are a pro player? And how many times did you die to become a pro? Every beginner will go through lives like a minigun through bullets.You even get to see the game run at third person perspective When you play as a real person? What the f***?.The soundtrack is terrible even for a terrible movie. The parody of SecondLife or something with the song ""The Bad Touch"" will be just one of the good reasons to walk out of the theater.The acting. Oh was it horrible and modern stereotypical. An evil ""genius"" who looks like he couldn't invent Tetris, a bad ass hero who has the hart of gold, a shrimpy sissy hacker kid and so on. And their lines, ugh... Oh, the movie is full of this cr**. Acting school or not, anyone can do this terrible.Terrible games may sell, but they don't last. That's why we have lots of people on YouTube reviewing them and getting lots of subscribers in the process. If you played more than one game in your life, you know adapting to new rules, challenges, puzzles and physics is key. Here it's just one chaotic massive skirmish, explosions and a cra**y plot. If you get attached to any of the characters, you probably need your head examined.Maybe as a book the story would be good, but it would not be a bestseller made into a movie. If you feel empty, I recommend a better 1987 film ""Running man"" with the same plot ideas and Arnold Schwarzenegger.",Gamer

Any human can control another in gaming environments. Kable seeks to regain his independence and freedom from the game, whilst hunting down the creator of the game.Before I sat down to watch Gamer I knew I'd be torn on my ultimate decision. I genuinely don't know if I liked this movie or not. I can't say that it wasn't extremely entertaining, but I can't say that it's a thoroughly enjoyable film to watch.Gamer features non-stop action from start to finish. Gerard Butler is fantastic as Kable, the star of one of the games and pulls off the action hero stereotype yet again. But Gamer, as a whole isn't completely satisfying. Many of the less action-filled scenes seem to either further confuse you or bore you. I wouldn't say this movie is as awful as it's made out to be in any way. The action is there and that's all the audience really wants. It's also all the movie offers. The sheer pace seems to be rushed, only to slow down close to the end to a fitting and entertaining ending.Would I recommend it? Well that I'm not sure about. If you want the action, watch it.

104,deltajvliet,Cyber Punk Action,7,4 September 2009,"Gamer is by no means profound, but it's still far more profound than it has any right to be. The movie is first and foremost an action vehicle for Gerard Butler to kick a lot of ass, and in that regard the movie succeeds brilliantly, but it takes an interesting look at the extremes of decadence people will go to when given the chance. To a lesser extent it also examines manipulation, accountability, centralization of power, and ways in which technology can be abused. Neveldine and Taylor, the guys behind Crank, have created a futuristic dystopia, complete with a cyber punk underground and a TV show where gladiators fight to the death for the the masses' entertainment, not unlike The Running Man or last year's Death Race. But what makes Gamer better was its probing into the above-mentioned themes and an actual hint of poignancy to its story. Death Race was just Paul WS Anderson crashing cars and Statham being Statham. Sure Gamer has its fair share of destruction in some very well made action sequences, but Butler is also able to bring some semblance of emotional depth to Kable. I don't mind one note, badass action heroes, but I don't mind when they feel, either. Gamer is no masterpiece, it's forgettable, but by God I enjoyed it. Fans of Crank, 300, or action films in general should have no problem liking the movie. 7/10",Gamer
105,c-conley90,What action movie rots your brain more this one or that one that Michael Bay released. Let's find out.,2,24 November 2012,"I really don't get the problems with Transformers 2, I mean this is way worse people. People can argue all they want, oh Gamer wasn't high budget, budget has nothing to do with this. And then they pull up the length issue, yes Transformers is over two hrs but crap Gamer feels bloated for it's 90 minute runtime. Gamer craps the bed before the 60 minute mark. What could be a good fine R-rated action movie is really just over the top and I thought I would never say it really over inflated with sex and violence. I mean I get it I like strong violence in my action movies sometimes, and I'm all for some nudity and sexual content. But then there's Gamer where we take even the established over the top levels of Crank 2 and move it to disgusting level. And of course I refer to the direction of Neveline and Taylor who at least did a better job in those. Or maybe because Chev Chelios was a better character than, Arnold repeated from Running Man played by Gerard Butler and even worse a little punk who gives Shia Lebeouf a run for his money on the douche annoying factor. Most of if not all the characters with the exception of poor Butler are miserably annoying jerks or really off their rocker like Michael C. Hall giving a kind of Dexter level performance. And how does people like Kyra Sedwick and Keith David end up in this movie, or John Leguizamo for that matte They all do respected acting work and must have taken one look at this and never took a look back. And in David's and Leguizamo's case are just supremely wasted. I mean folks give me Transformers 2 any day. But at least it didn't have shaky cam action scenes like this piece of sh-, I can't tell crap in these action scenes for the bad camera work and the flash strobe lighting and don't get me into the naked fat guy and rape porn. Ludicrous (I know I misspelled his name) shows up in a role that was like a rip-off of Ice-T from Johnny Mnemonic, which is surprising that people even remember that movie. Look I get it, the humor in Transformers 2 wasn't good, but at least I can take it over the bad rape humor. But I mean for god sakes this movie such a piece of crap. It's a hypocritical Running man rip-off that rolls around in it's extreme violence and sexual grossness that while I'm all for is sometimes too much of a good thing for a movie like this and maybe just maybe we need some moderation. I'm not saying I enjoy PG-13 action movies, but please this is opposite of some of humor in Transformers this is gross bullshit that makes juvenile fart humor and sexual innuendos seem harmless upside it. And don't even get me into the action scenes, where the camera is shaken to absurd digress to apparently heighten up the effect of the action. And I find it absurd when reviewers think these guys got this from watching Michael Bay or Tony Scott movies, last time I checked even those guys didn't shake the camera around so much in their movies. And furthermore their characters were ten times more sympathetic than these psychotics.",Gamer
106,sarahmillyhannah,The Best Bit? The Soundtrack,4,17 August 2010,"I didn't understand this film one little bit. Plenty of blowing up and killings, running around and shootings. I love Gerrad Butler, he can be a great actor and done some great films too, very easy on the eye, but he hardly says 2 words in this film and runs around shooting folk in some computer generated game. If i was to tell someone what this film was about, i would say its on the lines of Running man vs Surrogate (the new one with Willis where people live their lives view computer generated androids) some sort of computer generated game for survival. Thats it i don't get anything else from it am afraid. But it was sort of watchable. The best bit? Marilyn Manson singing 'sweet Dreams' for the sound track of course!",Gamer
107,SubZeroMK,Epic Win,10,4 September 2009,"Let me start off by saying that this movie is a DEFINITE blu-ray purchase in my books. Next to Transformers 2 and Terminator: Salvation.I was so excited and anxious to see this movie, even with the pre-show rolling. Goddamn, this movie did not fail one bit. If you liked the Crank movies, you'll love this movie. The director manages to squeeze in his some Crank elements in the movie, especially with the nudity, fast-paced violence, and humour. I think this would of been a better big screen debut for him. Anyways, doesn't matter. What matters is that I loved it, and you will love it as well. BUT, if you're a gamer.You obviously know what to expect from the trailer and the title of the movie, so being a gamer yourself makes this movie even better for you, just like it did for me. You may also choose to like the Sims or if you use Playstation Home on PS3, you'll also like this movie.The way the director presents the gaming culture is spot-on, probably because he loves videogames as much as the next person. I mean, you could see how much he loves retro-gaming in Crank 2. So everything was spot-on.What got me a little cheesed was that it was too short. I was hoping for a 2 hour or more movie, and although it was completely flawless in every aspect, it should of been longer.But this movie doesn't have to limited to just the gamer demographic. Action and Sci-Fi fans can watch this as well and love it. If you're a fan of dystopian settings or big brother settings in films, you'll also like this. This movie kinda combines the matrix with metal gear solid VR missions and escape from new york.A lot of people are saying this movie is basically ""The Running Man"" 2.0, but it's not. It seems like it, but it's not. Don't listen to that crap, those people who say that are probably cheapo's who can't afford a movie ticket and are very critical to others. That's probably why they analyze their life as we speak. You must see this movie, I insist that you do. And don't see at an AMC theatre, those are expensive. Go to Famous Players Cineplex theatres, they're certainly much cheaper.The visual effects were awesome and on par with Iron-Man and Transformers 2. The feel and setting of that big brother state where the world bids on living and breathing players to win their matches is amazing. It's like a big corporation controls the world, but it's really one guy who's got the world tuned in to his games, he's got everyone who loves games and television hooked on his newest live action game, ""Slayers"" . His ratings are up, and he's far richer than Bill Gates, overnight. The prison in the movie is also under strict martial law, so with all that combined, it's no telling how close humanity really is to virtual reality. Hell, it's possible, it just needs more funding and attention.So stop whatever you're doing, and go see this movie. After that, turn on your game console or PC computer and play Call of Duty 4, Killzone 2, or if you're in the MAG beta, play that. I know this movie had that effect on me. One other little tiny flaw this movie had was Ludicrous, I couldn't stand him, especially when he says ""we're all slaves man"" . How much did he get paid for that line? I swear it sounds so pre-prepared and scripted. I wonder is Rev. Jesse Jackson had anything to do with it. It's kinda obvious why he would say such a line, but I won't point out the irony there.So go see it, you won't regret it.",Gamer

The characters are obscenely stereotypical and clichéd. The acting is consistently dreadful all across the board (admittedly, one can seldom expect good acting to tower over a cripplingly mediocre script). And the lasting appeal is that of a B-movie, albeit with a thick budget.This would be the ultimate snooze fest if it wasn't for its own glaring shortcomings, which add an occasional slapstick element.Please, stay away from this atrocity of a movie.

109,ennieday09,Way better than I expected. Will probably be one of the most underrated movies of the year,6,25 September 2009,"I will start off by admitting I thought this movie was going to suck big time just judging it from the trailer but once again i love getting proved wrong from being so naive. We all know and love the star of this movie Gerard Butler from the intense action flick 300 and while his role in this movie is nowhere near the area of his King Leonidas role, he still delivers a very entertaining hit in this film. This movie is not for everyone and I am not gonna argue with people who hated it because it is very easy to hate a movie like this. Gamer is directed by Neveldine & Taylor (co-directors of the Crank franchise) and this film does not shed too far from the roots of Crank. I believe the first two scenes of this movie set the tone quickly as the action sequences kick in and blood and gore spill across a battlefield like a violent video game is taking place......oh wait it is a video game. I thought the plot and premise of this movie was intriguing and interesting throughout about humans controlling other ""Slayers"" and wanting to escape. The action sequences were well shot in my opinion and the plot kept you very interested. There are many scenes of bloody violence, panty shots, occasional boobage, and a few disturbing sights of a disgusting obese perverted man in a wheelchair. I recall in about the first 20 minutes of the movie about 5 ppl walked out obviously from the profound violence and suggestive content.You may think I am bashing this movie but not the case, I enjoyed this film very much but I am just giving people a heads up on what to expect. If you are not a fan of gory violence, or some sights of scantily clad women then this movie is certainly not for you. But if you are looking for a movie with cool action sequences and awkwardly funny moments (even though some of the scenes aren't meant to be funny) then you should check this out. Think of this as a Tarantino type film if you were to cut an hour off an skip all the dialogue.

The main reason I went to see this movie was because it looked like Death Race, you know, death row inmates playing a game to be set free, and believe me that is all the comparison you going to get between this two. Lets say that Death Race is more coherent than this movie and that is a lot to say. To tell the truth this movie looked like a bad experimental movie from the late 60's to the 70's, it was like Crisis meets the porno Sims. The sad part is that this movie last only 95 min.

An adult could separate, or at least recognize, the psychological dark moments. I would never recommend even a young adult, let alone teen, watch this.

But poor screenplay, horrible acting from Amber Valletta, Gerard Butler and Michael C. Hall, mindless fighting scenes and brief nudity ruined the basic concept itself. You will be disappointed even if you are expecting nothing much.However, soundtrack is the worth mention.

Ludicrous did an okay job, nothing terrible, but nothing special, and Kyra Sedgwick played her role with a lot of enthusiasm. The action doesn't disappoint, and the sets and cinematography were amazing. Also, they had a lot of good ideas, which made the movie more exciting. Overall, this movie is one adrenaline-rushed action flick. This movie isn't for every taste, but it is very entertaining. It's not an Oscar movie, but it is very exciting. If you plan on seeing this movie, then do it! Don't read the critical reviews for this movie, just go ahead and see it.Rating: 8.5/10",Gamer
119,ftyl,GAMER - Almost but not quite...,6,18 September 2009,"Alrighty so I've been waiting for Gamer for quite a while and what Neveldine and Taylor have pulled off is almost great in a lot of ways. The concept is good and for a change it has been executed by people who seem to halfway understand how these games and MMO worlds actually work. Even the story and the characters are strong and the bitter satirical tone works well with the impressive production design and solidly created near-future world. The main problem is that the Crank maestros didn't have enough faith in their creation and bombard the viewer with so much audio/visual garbage that it's often impossible to see what's going on – let alone enjoy the supposedly awesome action. The brief moments of stillness come as welcome oases in the deluge – so much so that I found myself literally counting seconds without a cut as though they were some kind of cinematic nirvana. But before long we're off on another nonsensical chase scene or assaulted with more stroboscopic glimpses of quivering flesh. As in the recent Crank: High Voltage, the directors seem intent on playing to every base image they can cram onto the screen and while there's a certain amount of fun to found in their disgusting, deviant world view it simply gets in the way of making you invest in the world they are trying to create.Still, I couldn't help but enjoy the sheer audacity of the vision – it's been a while since I've seen something this unique that actually had the courage to pursue its ideas to the (bitter) end. There are messages here too, touching on free will and the ever encroaching creep of internet based second lives but they aren't strong enough to leave a lasting impression. If Neveldine and Taylor grow up a little and realise that they can makes films for adults and not just horny, sugar high teenagers, we might finally get to see the gritty, visually unique action film I know they are capable of delivering.",Gamer
120,Rafacus,A good rental or gift for an FPS fanboi.,5,9 September 2009,"What's cool about Gamer is that it holds elements that are true to the Sims, MMORPG, Second Life experience. Every FPS player, MMO dabbler and anonymous degenerate can feel at home in the world of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). We are given the ultra-futuristic computer experience where the 3rd dimension pushes into the 4th and polygons are replaced by real, living, breathing human beings. Imagine playing Call of Duty 4 knowing that your player is a real person who will actually die if you walk into enemy fire. Imagine playing Playstation Home and controlling a hot avatar that can easily get some ""strange"" in the corner of the movie theater. What Gamer does is it shows us our anonymous, internet world if we were to go as far as to control reality.Kable (Gerard Butler) is a convicted felon and the only death row inmate to have survived over 28 matches in the real FPS game ""Slayers"". The game, set up by multi-billionaire genius Ken Castle, allows a player to take the reigns of an inmate turned soldier in a battle royale for their freedom. If an inmate wins 30 matches they can walk free, the only problem is that most inmates don't make it to 10. Castle whose success came in the form of a realistic version of Second Life where people volunteer to be controlled by players in a party atmosphere. The outline of the movie is to follow Kable as he tries and make it to that 30th game.Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor brought us a different form of action in Crank and the even crazier Crank: High Voltage, if you aren't a fan of those, chances are you will absolutely hate this. For me, this type of movie is the Mad Max of our time period, Death Race on an acid trip and with the fan-service to gamers it may be a cult classic waiting to happen. There are many cameos in the movie, not limited to John Leguizamo, Terry Crews (yes he dances in this one too, sigh), Zoe Bell and Milo Ventimiglia as the awesome Rick Rape. Kyra Sedgwick plays a convincing cougar-type and Amber Valletta is sexy.If I was to gripe about anything it would be the similarities with Death Race and the way the story wrapped up. It felt as if they wrote the final scenes while filming and didn't give any thought to the huge gaping plothole and questions it left in my mind. Don't I hate it when they do that! The music was on point ranging from explicitly sexy rave tunes to classy Sammy Davis Jr. and the cinematography was much like Crank, though I felt the Space-Aged monochromatic look in the prison shots was a bit much.This would be a good rental or a gift for an MMO player or an FPS fanboi but for average movie guy, stay far away. Still it's good to see King Leonidas back in the action again, as he was in RocknRolla. I look forward to the next installment.More reviews from me at www.SpicyMovieDogs.com.",Gamer

Stop Shovin it down my throat!",5,31 July 2010,"This wouldn't have been such a bad movie for me if it wasn't for the STUPID, RETARDED, POINTLESS way they tried to make it ""in your face"" gritty. Close-ups on every wound in slow-mo. Close ups on a fat guy shoving waffles dipped in syrup into his sweaty face. That was just dumb. We can see he's a fat tub, do we really need that much detail on him eating. And if that wasn't enough for close up eating scenes, there's another one where there's a close up on the main kid smearing green peanut butter on a sandwich, cutting the crusts off, then a nice in your face shot of him biting into it with sound effect. I honestly hope i run into this idiotic director so I can ask him if that was a really necessary scene. it was just pointless. Then all these shots of the bad black guy sweating and convulsing in anger. Edit all that POINTLESS crap out, and it would be OK. Those scenes were just incredibly annoying.",Gamer
122,Freddy_Boy,Who is the audience?,2,22 November 2009,"Gamer, starring ""This is Sparta"" Gerard Butler and ""Psychotic Serial Killer"" Michael C. Hall unfortunately seem to have been type-casted for this movie.While both of them are convincing as their respective characters. I can buy Hall as the eccentric and even slightly crazed multi-billionaire genius Ken Castle and Butler as the iconic star of the game Slayers: Kable. Who, as it turns out, happens to excel at killing people. But unfortunately their main contribution to the movie is a face, voice and some fancy punchlines. Hall's character probably even gets the most dialogue and he's not even the main character. To clarify: Shallow character portrayals, uninspired acting and cliché dialogue.The setting is rather cliché as well. Ken Castle, a ""next-generation"" Bill Gates (or an evil Mark Zuckerberg), has invented technology which allows players to control other humans. The first application of this was social networking game. But the story revolves around the follow-up: Slayers. A game which allows the players to control death row inmates in a game which simply is all about killing each other.The actual rules of the game is actually never explained but it involves team play and save points but with one winner, which so happens, to be Kable (Gerard Butler) who's controlled by the star player Simon (Logan Lerman).Any player that participates in thirty matches is automatically released. Kable has three more rounds to go before his release and, of course, there will be trouble.This story has been iterated many times before with gladiators of some sort fighting for freedom. Whether it be racing, running, fighting, shooting or just staying alive this really isn't in any way a fresh idea. Neither is the social commentary the movie attempts to make: Bill Gates never involved himself in game development, social networking sites such as Facebook really are applications which let you be yourself and, well, the terminology is out of place.Something called ""save points"" are in the game which are never explained at all. For us gamers a save point is a point where your game saves it's state automatically. But in a game like this, with real players in a real-life environment, how do you save a state like that? Just throwing some terminology around doesn't make it more convincing. If that were true I could pose as a doctor and theoretical physicist. It also seems as the writers simply failed in identifying the audience. For instance there's plenty of gore and over-the-top violence in Gamer and, again, I'm not sure the writers or the director realized that the most popular games are not known for their gore but their game mechanics.The most played MMORPGs, such as World of Warcraft, are cartoonish and childish in their design. The most popular First-Person Shooters are tactical shooters such as Battlefield: 1942 or Counterstrike. None of which depicts any actual gore.With a title like Gamer and the approach of a real-life video game I assumed they were aiming for a, well, gaming audience. But the more I watched I got the feeling that this movie is actually directed to those who are prejudiced about gamers.Games which do feature this amount of gore, such as Postal 2 and even Quake or Unreal, never actually generates that amount of success. Not today at least with such a young generation of players and such a huge audience. So why are there really bits and pieces of human flying around in this movie?All in all: Gamer may be intense, action-filled and with a respectable cast but it seemingly fails to relate to the audience or even make a social commentary of itself other than the fact that Hollywood can still be horribly self-absorbed.",Gamer
123,MoronUnited,My Brain Has Been Splattered Into Next Tuesday,9,4 September 2009,"Leaving the theater after seeing Gamer, I truly felt as if my brain had been tossed into a meat grinder. Neveldine and Taylor, the directing team behind the Crank series is back again with an action movie that only further shows that this directing duo are the supreme rulers of the 21st century action genre. Dear god, this movie is just..........holy mother of.........indescribable. How can mere mortal words explain just how amazing this movie is? Gerard Butler plays Kable, a death row inmate wrapped up in a cruel game that has captivated the minds of the entire human race. Convicted death row inmates are given a choice in this depiction of a not-so-far-off earth future: rot in jail or take part in a game in which you must fight your way through thirty rounds of mayhem to be set free. But there's a catch.....when you are in a match, a gamer has complete control of your physical movements. It's an interesting plot that is thrown out the window in favor of massive gunfights and explosions. Seriously, watching this movie is an absolutely insane experience from start to finish; a fulfilling movie for the mind and soul.Gamer is the movie that Michael Bay has tried for over a decade to make, and has failed miserably each and every time. Neveldine and Taylor just know exactly what action fans want to see and have succeeded in reviving the dead action genre three time out of their three directing attempts. The action scenes in this movie are simply stunning in every sense of the word. Cars do barrel rolls through the air while engulfed in flames, body parts are mangled, human corpses are thrown across the screen like rag-dolls.......it's truly a spectacle to behold. The constant action pulls viewers in thanks to being coupled with great effects and a hardcore musical score.Another great aspect of the film is the cinematography, which is nothing short of genius. Normally, shaking the camera this violently only helps to hammer in the nails on a movie's coffin, but here, it is done so well and with such brilliant direction that it enhances the tense feelings given off throughout the movie. Sure, there is the occasional obvious green screen effect, but that's all part of the fun that Neveldine and Taylor are known for with their Crank series, which Gamer takes quite a few notes from.Random cameos are in no short supply either in Gamer, but it's many lesser known stars such as James Roday and Maggie Lawson from Psych and Milo Ventimiglia from Heroes. Even John Leguizamo has an important role in the movie in which he performs very naturally. As far as the supporting cast is considered, Michael C. Hall and Kyra Sedgwick are both phenomenal, and despite them seeming to be odd choices for a movie such as this, the casting decisions were nothing short of excellent.What can I possibly say that will assure that you go see Gamer in the theaters? Seriously, if you are looking for an action movie in a time when action movies tend to suck, look no further than Neveldine and Taylor's latest action masterpiece. It's an electrifying and explosive flick that is pervasively loud and violent, and that's all we action fans could ever ask for. One of the best action movies of the decade, and one of the greatest movie experiences I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Two thumbs up and expect to have your mind splattered across the theater walls.",Gamer
124,plasticmask,Fun Movie,9,16 July 2021,"I liked this movie.

125,Lifexinxrewind,An entertaining if very flawed futuristic thriller.,6,2 April 2010,"One thing Gamer has going for it is that it's very entertaining. Despite it's obvious flaws I had no trouble staying awake for it and the action did show some creativity from time to time. The main problem with Gamer is it's obvious that they didn't know how to end the movie properly, so it degenerates into a typical nonsensical fight scene. The other main issue being many of it's better moments are updated versions of scenes from The Running Man or Minority Report. There really isn't a limit to the sometimes overbearing visual style, and obviously the finer points of the film are glossed over to a typical degree. Still, points for at least trying to inject some social commentary into the film and not holding back when making it's point.",Gamer
126,GloriousGooner,Exciting action thriller,7,4 April 2010,"The kinetic hyper-realistic style of Crank finds its natural home here in Gamer recreating the fast and bloody environment of 1st person shooter games. Kable is the hero, convicted of murder, a pawn in the violent solution to the booming prison population masterminded by Castle whose ulterior motives are painfully obvious from the outset. The action is brilliant throughout - fast, graphic, explosively brutal this dishes up everything you want with lashings of claret. Nevermind the characters or story - there is a vague statement about society and the media amidst the chaos but thats not what i was watching it for. It's hard, testosterone-fuelled carnage from start to finish with little let-up between, a definite winner IMO.",Gamer

128,darth-tobe,A lot of potential wasted on a very simplistic action flick,3,20 June 2015,"Imagine digital entertainment where players dress, equip and control a persona in the game world and interact with a community of other players through these personas. Now replace the digital personas with real, remote controlled human beings and assume that society had evolved to be OK with that. That's this film's basic premise. Then, one step further, take 3rd person shooter games where a player equips and controls a virtual soldier in a combat arena fighting other players' soldiers and, again, replace the virtual combat with the real thing. That's what had me interested. The whole idea of these brutal ""games"" and a society that accepts them as entertainment strongly reminded me of Rollerball, The Running Man or Death Race 2000. At first, the film sets this up really well: ""players"" have become detached from the fact that they control other human beings and they overlook the visceral details of the battles they control. Then there's the focus on the protagonist Kable (Geralt Butler) with his mysterious motivation and his player, who is actually just a naive kid. I was expecting the film would focus on this relationship, maybe forcing them into a reluctant partnership. Of course, in the tradition of dystopian future stories, there's also a resistance trying to shut the games down. So, with this number of parties involved I was getting ready for some interesting things to happen. Sadly the film does not deliver what it promises. I think the important questions like who Kable is and what makes him so significant to his opponents were left largely unanswered. The relationship with the actual ""gamer"" - the player - is never really explored and even the game aspect itself becomes fairly redundant. Ultimately, I felt even The Running Man made its main character more believable - and that's saying a lot. So, this film borrows concepts from other dystopian death game scenarios but it doesn't do much with them except modernize and further dumb down the plot. It's almost as if producers were scared of stepping on corporate toes. Whatever talent or potential the film may have is wasted on a flimsy excuse of a plot to make Geralt Butler's grizzled fighter beat and shoot things up. I found it entertaining for a while and then the convenient coincidences, contrived conclusion and especially the mustache-twirlingly evil villain got on my nerves. From the blurb I was expecting a reasonably complex sci-fi action thriller. Those expectations were clearly the wrong ones.",Gamer
129,jlcdrama,"Great Action, Not So Great Plot",5,16 September 2009,"I went into the theater expecting a great action movie. What I got was a mediocre action movie.The Good Stuff: Amazing action. I was on the edge of my seat during the battle scenes with Gerard Butler's character Kable. His character was well thought out and very easy to relate too. Some sterling acting on Butler's part. Michael C. Hall stole the show with his character Ken Castle, the villain of the story. He was an excellent mad scientist kind of character. The idea of the film is good too. Our world has certainly become a gaming world so the idea about a video game that controls people is easy to understand. The character Simon, the seventeen year old who controls Kable, was very funny. I genuinely enjoyed his scenes.The Bad Stuff: This movie had a great idea, but the plot line was lacking a lot. There were way too many holes in it that were filled in by action and nudity. Some of the characters were pointless while others were needed but not fully rounded. Ken Castle was good, but his motives behind his actions weren't always clear particularly when it came to adopting Kable's daughter. It didn't make any sense why he would adopt the girl after her father was sent to prison. Certainly he couldn't have imagined that Kable would escape in the end. It just seemed odd that he would assume years before Kable's escape that he would see any use for her, even to use against Kable.The plot line never was fully developed obviously. With the character Humanz, I assumed he was leading some sort of revolution against the game Slayers but it was never fully shown. While I could certainly see why he would object to it, I couldn't understand what his motives were or how he even planned on stopping the game. Ken Castle's plan to take over the world was interesting, but again I couldn't find any rhyme or reason to it. We never got to really know Castle so it was hard to fear or hate him like other villains.Besides the thin plot, my main complaint is the nudity. Star Wars proved that you can have an excellent SciFi movie without having to show a woman's breasts every seven seconds. Perhaps the intention was to show that when given the chance, humans let loose their dirty side if there aren't any rules. If that was the intent, it was overlooked. The nudity was distracting, taking away from the plot. They should have put less topless women and more juice to plot line.In total, it could have been A LOT better. I recommend renting this movie and seeing if you like it instead of taking the time to go to the theater.",Gamer

They hired some great actors, but no one could save this script. Michael C Hall does not fit his character whatsoever (and don't get me started on his song and dance routine.)There's a scene where a character drinks alcohol, vomits it into a car's petrol tank, and then uses said vomit to fuel the car. This is meant to be taken seriously. That scene actually sums the entire film up pretty well.I've lost interest that much that I still have the movie on as I type this. They could've gone properly dark and gritty, like Black Mirror, or taken a light hearted B movie approach. Unfortunately they awkwardly sat on the fence between these two choices.Save yourself the disappointment and watch Ready Player One instead.",Gamer
132,eferoth,yeah... you know,5,1 February 2010,"First off, I was entertained throughout the movie and it wasn't for all the wrong reasons either. Its a nice, if a bit mediocre action-flick.The Slayer sequences were nice to watch, the info-trash design was nice to see, and the story is a stitched together something of things we've all seen before and didn't care about before either. Nothing surprising here, but nothing really bad either. There's a bit of social commentary along the way that I found to be a bit too obvious, but if everything else in a movie is loud, why would this be an exception.The way they depicted the gaming community ticked me off a bit (obese-secluded-perverts here smartassed-bullshitting-teensters there, self-indulging world-changing hackers topped off with a World were one Avatar seems more ludicrous than the next... come on, not even second-life is that bad), but I think it will take a few more years for that perception to change. (Thank you Wii). (But I had to laugh really hard about Simon (was it?) getting called a Cheater from all sides.) The third-person perspective for a shooting game (especially when you have a 360 screen) seems an idiotic choice at best. The movie would have been ""better"" if they'd put in something along the lines of that one shot in the Doom movie. Only more of it. You know, less Butler more first-person. This is obviously a movie intended to appeal to fans of shooters, and for that they don't seem to know anything about it at all. Seems in the future everyones favourite is still CTF... only in third person... ah enough about that.Well, there's really nothing terribly wrong with this movie, its just not good either, fun, but not good. Rent it on an evening where there's nothing else to do.By the way, I loved that one scene that ticked off so many others. Who cares about logic? Was it stupid?

133,LumosX,"Painful to watch, but with some quality",4,16 October 2014,"It's hard for me to say when the last time I saw a non-violent film was, and given that I enjoy video games myself, I thought ""Gamer"" would be something I would really like, especially given that I was feeling like watching Gerard Butler kick arse, with explosions on the side. I couldn't've been more wrong, and I should've seen it coming since the ultimate beginning, as the film starts with Marilyn Manson's (dreadful) cover of Eurythmics's classic song ""Sweet Dreams"".I'll make it short. First and foremost, the action in this film is filmed in the shakiest, most jarring manner, which actually gave me a headache; and this has never happened before. Neither when watching at home, nor at a cinema; not on 3D films, and not even on ""The Hobbit""'s custom 48-fps 3D or whatever, which was quite jarring as well. The instability of most shots, combined with the fact that a lot of the shots (and most dialogues) consisted of terrible close-ups of people's faces, combined with flashing lights and an arguable cinematographic taste in contrast made the whole experience pain-inducing, as weird as that is.The characters aren't developed at all, and we are quite often left ""in the dark"" about their motives. Gerard Butler gives us one of his regular ""tough guy"" performances, and is good at it as usual, but most of the acting is unremarkable. Exceptions include Michael C. Hall's great performance as the ""villain"", I don't believe I've seen him in anything before, and he did look like a maniac; and Amber Valetta (who I've seen in a couple of films before) was excellent as the troubled wife of Butler, looking properly indifferent and robotic whilst under control. Keith David appears in a small cameo (and as a voice in an advert), but it was nice nonetheless.The plot? The plot is mostly nonsensical, and anything worth looking for appears to come together only after the 75-minute mark, which is, in fact, the beginning of the film's conclusion. However, the film's ending, whilst outrageous, awkward, and frankly, complete tosh, was surprisingly enjoyable.The violence is... gratuitous, and that took me by surprise. I mean, come on, I watch films with violence in them and I play violent video games. But this was still too much. I should also say that I am in fact quite disgusted with the way the future is portrayed in this film. More solace could be found even in films like ""Nirvana"" (1997), with its atmospheric dystopia. I do realise that this was probably the filmmakers' intention, but that does not mean that I liked it, nor that I enjoyed it.Four out of ten, because my eyes hurt, and the depiction of society was dreadful.

I had low expectations of this thing, but even they weren't met. All the cast members did as well as he could with the material they had, but Michael C. Hall's character was horribly flat (not his fault)and Butler's felt stilted and constrained. Hall's song-and-dance number near the end ALMOST redeemed the picture, but the dreaded ""documentary-style"" camera work (which was almost constant) was near-seizure inducing. This might appealed to Ritalin-deprived teenagers so ADHD that their teeth buzz in their sleep, but grown-ups should steer clear.",Gamer
135,angry-man,No what I expected...,7,18 October 2010,"I was thumbing through the Netflix new releases and recommendations and came across this yet again, thinking, no I still don't really want to watch it. The trailers and marketing for this flick were abysmal and were, truth be told, largely why I wasn't particularly interested. A 2.5 rating on NF (or any rating for that matter) is usually a very accurate cross section of opinion, more so than on the IMDb for example, so normally I'm not above letting the NF user reviews guide my decisions somewhat, well I'm very glad this time that I didn't.To start with, the film is directed and written by Neveldine/Taylor (aka Mark Neveldine & Brian Taylor). These are the blokes that brought us Crank and Crank 2. This immediately peaked my interest, plus the added bonus of Michael C. Hall of Dexter fame as the villain. And so I gave it a shot. The result was a ride that was satirical, dystopian, kinetic, provocative, violent and action packed. There's really a lot more too this film than meets the eye, I recommend you check it out. And what's next for Neveldine/Taylor, well, it's the sequel to the somewhat underrated ""Ghostrider"" and given what they bring to the table this sequel will not only likely rock, but be a sight better than it's predecessor as well unless I miss my guess.See More 9 hours ago · Like",Gamer

Yet Gamer has updated this with more action, yet less blood, and some pretty awesome computer technology. Yet this movie went wrong in so many ways. Butler is an action star, and he can act, although it doesn't happen here, but I don't think that was Butler's fault. The movie just didn't call for it. But for some reason it did call for 3 very drawn out and badly executed music videos. Didn't the directors learn from Oliver Stone (Any Given Sunday) that music videos within a film is a bad idea? Obviously not; there's even an awful musical number complete with terrible choreography and ""singing"" by Dexter's Michael C. Hall, who I normally like. Some of the plot twists are ridiculous also.

142,Magic_Lantern,"Frenetic, energetic and fun but slightly disappointing",7,17 September 2009,"Gamer is the third film from directors Neveldine/Taylor; having written and directed the brilliantly insane Clank series, I was looking forward to see how they got on with a new concept. Gamer retains the frenzied kinetic energy of Clank and blends it with an intriguing if unoriginal plot based around the use of real life gaming avatars.The plot is mildly stimulating but failed to engage me to any significant extent; I think this may be due to its overall simplicity and unoriginality spread thinly throughout scenes of rapidly edited action, explosions and violence. However, this action is a very well stylised distraction directed with a very novel approach. Visually, the film looks great and normally I'm not a fan of a flashy heavy editing style but it didn't bother me in this case; though I did find my mind wondering with scene after scene of shoot-'em-up style action sequences. Scenes set in the film's online simulated world, similar to that of The Sims or PlayStation Home, offer some attractive visuals and entertaining comedy value.Gerard butler offers an adequate performance with little dialogue, but I kept thinking to myself that Jason Statham or Bruce Willis (in his peak) could have done a better job. Butler's disguised Scottish accent often odd to hear. However, the supporting cast were impressive, in particular Michael C. Hall as Butler's antagonist.I enjoyed Gamer but was mildly disappointed at its lack of originality; but it was fast, fun and frenetic with a decent soundtrack, stylish direction technique and a good cast but overall I felt it could have been more.6/10.",Gamer
143,dmcmillan01,"A story about exess, with too much excess in it",4,17 January 2010,"I have been a big Gerard Butler fan since 1997 when he did Mrs. Brown. And I had high hopes for GAMER as I liked the concept. But the directors do not seem to realize that less is more. That to show a lot of bad and disturbing things with so much excess lessens the impact. It's over kill. I remember a film director who bought a script from me saying, ""Never show the ""monster"" too soon. Once people see the monster, it is no longer as scary as it was when you were only imagining it."" That is pretty much what Neveldine and Taylor did with Gamer. They brought out ALL the monsters at once and beat us in the head with them. No longer scary. Just tiring. They also promised us there would be a GAME. A computer type game. But it wasn't there. No strategy, no cleverness, nothing at all like the games on a computer. It was just run, shoot, run, shoot, on and on. The only clever part when Butler peed and puked into a car's gasoline tank. The action and excess overshadowed the great actors who played in it. And it's really difficult to overshadow Gerard Butler. With about 30 films under his belt, he's pretty damn good on the screen, even when the movie he's in isn't all that great. Michael C. Hall faired a little better and stood out some as the movie went on. If you like shaky cams, unbelievably long actions scenes doing the same thing over and over, and an excess of almost everything else in the movie, then by all means take a look at it. I love action films, horror films, murder mysteries, suspense thrillers, comedy, drama, and any other genre you can think of. But I did not like GAMER. Didn't hate it. Just plain didn't enjoy my time spent with it. The DVD will be out on Tuesday January 19. Who knows, YOU may like it a lot. DottyinCA",Gamer

The actors are either under done or over done to a weird extreme. Oh, and can you say cliché to the maximum? If you like mindless entertainment that you don't have to think about this is probably the movie for you.

Apart from inducing a headache, they pretty much view like a clockwork orange style compilation of extreme violence and random bizarre images.I'd love to see the work done in post production. ""OK, let's put that clip there of the guy in the white coat pushing a broom getting his head blown off, then cut to Kable looking determined, quick shot of kid in weird videodrome, quick cut to Kable looking determined, cut to fat guy, cut to guy getting neck snapped, cut to white noise, cut to explosion, cut to blurry dotted image of man getting large spray of blood across his face, cut to Kable looking determined - oh yes that's great work right there. But I think we need another shot of a guy getting his head blown off....""It really is a mess and leaves you wanting to turn away from the screen or hoping for the next slow mo explosion/truck ramp/act of extreme violence just to give the eyes a break.Now to the story.The story is - ""the running man"" - yes the film made 20 years earlier (that still looks better than this) has been mercilessly ripped off for pretty much the entire storyline. Oh no, sorry, I forgot, in this case a guy controls the guy in the show (sorry ""game"") - or does he? There is some convoluted dialogue regarding this, but to clear up any further problems that this creates with regard to Kable's ""exceptional ability"", the plot device of ""cutting him loose to reduce his ping"" is deployed halfway in.As far as I'm concerned that really did highlight the pointlessness of the avatar controller, who seemed to add nothing at all to running man's excellent premise and story.Anyhow, here's the spoiler I warned about so don't read on if you want to avoid it.....Arnie... whoops sorry.... Kable busts out of the game and meets the leader of the resistance - the ultimate computer geek hacker, perfectly cast as hip hop rapper Luda-cris.The dialogue is at times extremely comical at this point with references to some seriously off the hook low ass ping response times being met with a grave expression of concern by Kable.But this is where I have to give the director some real credit. The film has really not gone well up to this point and it would take something special to redeem it. Luckily, he has a trick up his sleeve.Kable goes to confront the evil software engineer behind the slayer series (Ken Castle) and enters a dimly lit room with no exits. Slowly, a dozen burly henchmen file out and at the centre of them is software hardman, Ken. Now I thought I knew what was coming and boy was I wrong. Here the director displays a stroke of true genius by entering Ken and his henchmen into a song and dance number!At this point I was truly bewildered.Anyway, cue the traditional ""We've reverse hacked you and I've hacked you back, no I've hacked you really craftily...etc etc"" and then them driving a car through a tunnel.Absolutely sterling stuff.",Gamer

I didn't ask for much from this movie, less camera shaking and more gore, I might've liked it. But instead of delivering stunts and gore (like Death Race) it relies on its 'original' ideas and contrived plot to coast through its run time. The Running Man with Schwarzenegger had style and charisma, Death Race had stunts and gore, if i expected great acting from any of these I would be disappointed. I don't. ALL i ask is for watchable violence, none of that in Gamer, lots of camera shaking and running, but nothing impressive. OK, maybe an original story? Hell no, they figured The Running Man and Death Race had good stories lets steal theirs.

It was hard to tell what was going on because of all the back story that needed to be covered, but was not even skimmed over.The action is good for about the first ten to twenty minutes of the movie, however, after those twenty (awesome) minutes, the movie turns to its plot for the core of the movie, which was clearly a mistake.I am not sure why this movie is getting a rating above 7, but I'm sure it will drop soon.

150,sukhij25,Interesting Ideas!,7,29 July 2010,"GamerMovie and games are like the most favorite things in my life(besides music, of course!). To see a combination of those wouldn't be too bad, would it? Actually I was extra psyched! So I started watching Gamer with high hopes. And I must say, I am not disappointed! It starts awesomely, kind of making an impression on the audience from the start. This can be categorized as a Sci-fi thriller. One of my favorite categories too, when it comes to movies. Very awesome Ideas about the future of gaming, is presented. I'm not going to discuss about the pros and cons about those ideas, coz they certainly are cool! Comparing with other sci-fi thrillers, this one moves closely with Surrogates, but again much more awesome. I feel the need to discuss the lameness and stupidity of the program Society however. I mean what kind of music they play there? The obscenities and the tendency towards pornography, is very demeaning. Disregarding the coolness, this displays a very negative attitude towards the future. Maybe the creators were trying to increase the coolness by the weird stuff going on ""Society"". But it has become a very negative thing in my mind. The movie would have been still cooler and awesome without all the porn! ( But not in the mind of perverts of course!) I have nothing against porn. But when they use this amount of pornography in such a movie it really puts down a notch the greatness of the movie. And who the hell would wanna dress up like that? Maybe the whole idea was to depict it as a weird and a sick place. Kind of a pun intended for the massively popular social networks these days. However the in game action pieces in ""Slayers"" are so wicked! Its all well made, giving you the feel of an ultra cool actual game. But the down side of such a gaming environment is it'll be more realistic. No aliens or monsters and No superweapons. In order for them to work they have to be real and already invented weapons, Right ? A fictitious superweapon cannot kill anyone in ""Slayers""! Another futuristic idea is the conversations between the character and the player. Considering the movie this is not such a big deal but they certainly try to make it a big deal. But think what if we could actually talk with someone like Gordan Freeman, who doesn't talk with anyone else! (Sure it won't be like talking to that ""freemans mind"" guy in Machinima). The Music really suits the theme too. Kind of give a feel of a gory musical. But something so awesome must have some downsides right? Like for instance much stereotypes can be found. A thing that I don't always get, is why can't a decent director with common sense of quality collaborate to such a cool movie. The writers Neveldine\Taylor must've been kind of high for sure. There's some really weird stuff. Not bad weird always, but cool stuff too. Really artistically weird stuff like in Hellblazer. Exceptional role by Michael C. Hall. I think he'll make an able candidate for the role of Joker. BTW I lolled so hard when I saw Peter Petrelli form Heroes in this one. He's brief appearance was a real contrast to the lame character he plays in Heroes. I must say that I have a feeling that this movie is kind of under-appreciated. It deserves more rep people. My final score would be: 7/10",Gamer

The movie also has some interesting twists and turns, but does not void the plot, unlike some other movies released over the past few years. If you have stayed away thinking this is another Crank type mayhem movie, it is not, and if the action scenes were toned down, the story would not suffer in any way. **Spoiler Alert** I originally found the ending disappointing, but very soon after I came to really like it.

I lasted 25 minutes before my girlfriend and I walked out (someone was trying to tear his neck open and a women had just been decapitated by a shell when we left). I didn't care about any of the characters - you couldn't. No-one has anything to say and there are no sympathetic characters. Everyone is blatantly out there for him- or herself. There is a lot of wholly-gratuitous nudity (I am a big fan of the female form but not in a way that is sexually demeaning - and all the nudity in this film is sexually-demeaning).Frankly this film would have been better if everyone had died before the end of the first reel.

I won't say too much, but there's a particularly juicy scene involving some kind of giant snowplow.""Gamer"" shines most brightly, and most unexpectedly, as a science fiction piece. The film interweaves themes familiar to our 2009 reality, including economic desperation, prison overcrowding, the fallout of materialism, and technology naively promoted as a panacea for society's ills.""Gamer"" shows us a society addicted to technology at the expense of facing reality. Masses of gamers, locked in adolescence or enraptured by the promise of mindless self-indulgence without consequence, living solely through their avatars. Desperate segments of society, the poor and criminal, who have surrendered control of their bodies to the will of gamers. A populace that embraces televised war games as a solution to prison overcrowding, rather than addressing the true causes of mass imprisonment. The megalomaniacal pushers of technology running largely unchecked as the masses surrender control.Michael C. Hall delivers a breakout silver screen performance as the multifaceted Ken Castle -- after his great work in Six Feet Under, this is another power move for his career. Kyra Sedgwick nails her cougar reporter character, who begins the film as another no-conscience profiteer but becomes more through the course of the film.

If you like those kind of games, and if you want your movies to look just like them, then good for you.The only reason I gave this movie a shot was because of the cast: Gerard Butler is one of my favorite actors; ditto with Kyra Sedgwick; and who hasn't watched Dexter without falling in love with Michael C. Hall? Here, Hall is the best thing about the movie, eschewing his Dexter persona as an arrogant techno-nerd with an annoying Southern twang and Blofeld-esquire dreams of controlling the world. Kyra Sedgwick does her best with a thankless roll; watching her in this sort of movie is like watching a baseball great stumble about a field years after he should have retired (not that Ms. Sedgwick should retire; I just think she's too talented to waste herself in this sort of project).And Gerard Butler, so dynamic as Leonidas in 300 and as the titular character of Phantom of the Opera, so touching as Gerry in P.S. I Love You and as The Stranger in Dear Frankie ... alas, once his start took off, Butler has never met a script he did not like.

Survive 30 rounds, and you're set free. The only problem is, no one has ever beat the game. When death row inmate Kable (Gerard Butler), the icon of Slayer, discovers he's a part of a conspiracy involving Slayer, Society (another game where people control people) and Ken Castle, the man who created both games. Will Kable survive long enough to expose the plot, or be another victim to the game.Gamer is certainly a creative and entertaining movie, one that's not based on a video game, but a movie about video games. Neveldine/Taylor are strange and inventive directors, but not the best (Crank 2 and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance are examples of their failures). Though, here, they are at their best. With gritty, ""in your face"" camera work and non-stop violence, Gamer certainly takes action to another level. Although, their writing is poor here. Almost all of the footage involving Society, a Sims-esque reality, is all about sexual drive. So, really, that's the biggest low-point of Gamer; where they show Society being all about sex. The high-point of Gamer, though, is the acting. Gerard Butler is better here than in 300, and Michael C. Hall as Ken Castle was just amazing. A scene towards the end where Kable and Ken come face-to-face, and with Castle's goons is just phenomenal (also, the best written scene). The visual effects are good for a lower-budgeted film, and the soundtrack is good and fitting. I just wish they got rid of a lot of the sexual content from the movie because, if they did, and focused more on the regular prison life outside Slayer (as well as life outside Society) the movie would have been truly great.7/10 Stars",Gamer

After watching it though I liked the story, the idea of it is interesting, the acting is OK, I just don't know why it's rated so low. I know the movie is about Tillman/Kable/Gerard Butler and trying to get back to his wife and then to get his daughter back but the movie needed more of the 'society' game in there to really make this more of a action/sci-fi movie then a action/drama movie. It could do with less party/rave things and show more of what society is really like in the online world and in reality. The movie did well in that it had an attractive woman who was in reality an obese man in a wheelchair and how the people are there not so much as a social thing but they are looking for their sexual fantasies to be fulfilled.",Gamer

They said it is a vision of the future, I think it's not, because we are already living in a world where some ones are using others and some ones are used by others, where some ones are abusing others and some ones are abused by others, and we can see how bad is the humans to each other across the times .This movie makes me wonder if we are influencing TV, or are we influenced by TV, it is very hard to find a simple answer, may be the simple answer is ""both"", we influence and we are influenced.Finally I am scared, where are we going like this?

168,AverageStalker,Absolute garbage... not sure where to begin,1,6 August 2014,"This film is pure trash. No characters are given any depth whatsoever- not even the protagonist. Every person in the movie is basically made out to be a sadistic, murder loving, soulless beast.If such a program as ""society"" were to actually be created, it would serve one purpose alone: sex. That's all people would care about it for. That being said, murder follows sex. So if, as the movie claims, ""people who are being controlled are paid to be controlled"", you would basically be agreeing to be a human sex doll that would contract HIV within a few days and have a pretty solid shot at being murdered in a torturous manner. I don't even think the most destitute and desperate of people would step forward at that opportunity. I'd rather rob people than allow myself to be controlled by a teenager for the means of having a train run on me.Then comes the issue of ""slayers"". ""They are death row inmates,"" says the movie. But if you compare the number of gamers in our world to the number of people awaiting execution, you are left with an absurd ratio that immediately indicates that such a premise is completely impossible. It is impossible to suspend your disbelief during this movie.The special effects are garbage. Casualties are treated as blood-filled water balloons that burst when hit. The blood looks more like play-DOE than it does liquid. The ""wife"" doesn't have a single line of dialog. The majority of society doesn't seem to care about any of the prisoner's struggles because they are ""convicted"", and yet all of the world has a sudden epiphany at the end and changes sides. Even the names of the factions are corny. 'Humanz'? Really? You couldn't think of a better name for the resistance? The ""bad guy"" is such a bad actor that I truly believe I could do better myself. Laugh randomly and make crappy puns, got it. Show no emotion and give no logical explanation for your sociopath behavior. Oh, I almost forgot: one does not simply chug an entire bottle of vodka, run across a battlefield, vomit into a car engine and then urinate into it, and then use that as fuel to drive away. The logistics of this are horrendous.I can't even bring myself to give this film 2 stars. I'd give it 0 if I could. The very premise of it is ridiculous. The dialog is extremely over-dramatic and poorly written. There isn't a single good quote in the entire movie.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

169,No_Nonsense,"If the cake was a lie, this movie takes the cake!",1,21 December 2009,"How to make a nasty meal using great ingredients...Take fantastic actor Michael C. ""Dexter"" Hall for a movie. Take the puzzling and intriguing concept we all've been toying with in the back of our heads since the release of the first Sims game (and much prior to that for sci-fi writers and some fans): virtual, guiltless, risk-free experience of our countless fantasies. Take a big budget.What do you expect the result to be? If you've answered ""a brilliant movie"", please get out. If you guessed ""a vivid tribute to the careers of Steven Seagal/Dolph Lundgren/Jean-Claude Van Damme (put name of a big star of mindless action movies here) starring Dexter and with a few sex and violence scenes thrown in the mix for pure shock value"", you might have seen the movie already.According to the director/writers of the movie, geeks are first and foremost fat and brainless dudes who get turned on in front of their computer by any kind of sex representation, thanks for the cliché, and gamers are stupid and idle wealthy teenagers who got nothing better to do in their life, thanks for the second cliché. As both a geek and a gamer, friend of geeks and gamers, I have to say this: if you don't know what geeks and gamers are, don't do a movie about them; if you don't know that they will be the first ones to go see the movie, don't insult them by pretending the movie is made for them in the first place... I'm sorry, but a film that's all about a not-so-far time when we'll be controlling people by the tips of our hands is nothing but a dream for all of us who read Sci-Fi books and spend hours on video games, so you can't both ask us to see the movie and treat us like we're all douche-bags with no life and no empathy whatsoever.Now that this is out of the way, let's talk about the story itself. Not about the super cool concept that's been wasted from the beginning, but about the storyline itself. We follow some uninteresting man trying to get out of a video game in which he is - magnificently well - controlled by a lazy teenager. Cos he wants to get back to his family: his unbearable mindless wife, who is controlled by a fat pervert in another video game, and who uses her as a virtual porn star ; and his daughter, who has been put up for adoption. The daughter being almost non-existent, we don't really care about what's happening to her. Like, at all. The big bad guy of the movie is of course Mister Hall, as if incarnating one of the most brilliant TV characters of all time could give any kind of credibility to his boring and stupid character in the movie. So we're there, watching an unlikable guy fighting unlikable enemies to get back to an unlikable woman and an invisible child. Yeah. That's so what I was looking for: a stupid chick flick.Don't get me wrong here. I have nothing against chick flicks. But I went to see a Sci-Fi action-filled concept-bubbling movie.Oh yeah, let's talk about the action too. Ever watched a movie in which the cam is so shaky you're not really sure what's going on? Ever watched a movie in which stunts are not well-made, fights look bad and boring, and the music really doesn't help? Well, you've got the idea on what to expect. Aside from discovering that Michael C. Hall is pretty good-looking with his shirt off, there's nothing joyful, ecstatic or jubilating watching the fights. And that's kind of tiresome since the movie is full of them.One more comment has to be made, and it holds in one word: CONSISTENCY. In the realm of Gamer, only death row inmates who struck a deal with the government are allowed to risk their lives in the WAR game, otherwise this would be illegal and just plain wrong. This point is made (forced down the viewer's throat) several times. BUT it is absolutely fine to rape, torture, mutilate, purposely give diseases to and even kill ANY regular citizen as long as they happen to have a regular job as ""actors"" for the DATE game... Go figure (just a figure of speech, here — avoid this stinker at all costs)!All in all, a promising concept that doesn't hold a flicker of enjoyment. A boring, badly directed, badly written and not very well acted either movie that will make you regret having ever seen it. If you love Sci-Fi, if you love video games, if you love Dexter and if you love movies at least. Other than that, you're safe to give it a go...",Gamer
170,Bleam66,Gamer suffers just one fatal flaw.,5,11 March 2010,"""Set in a future-world where humans can control other humans in mass- scale, multi-player online gaming environments, a star player from a game called ""Slayers"" looks to regain his independence while taking down the game's mastermind.""Gamer is a movie that is truly a love hate situation. As we venture on into the future, more and more of society is becoming comfortable with the real notion that electronics, more so gaming in general, is becoming a very huge part of entertainment. Basing off this logic, I think quite a few people were excited for this idea.Where Gamer fails to captivate us is not the idea, but how it was executed. Take for example the idea of Kill Bill V.1 and V.2, both movies could have quite easily been combined into one movie, though you would sacrifice confusing the audience and ruining what could be an incredible experience. Gamer is exactly that. Too much to show and tell in such a limited time. I have little doubts that Gamer could have been great, granted it had at least a sequel to follow up on.Without spoiling anything, you will often find yourself wondering just what this part connects to. Eventually it will reveal and you will still have some questions. Other parts seemed unneeded at best. There was just far too many moments that could have been done better given more time to explain them, or parts that should have been better and suffer the same flaw.Gamer is not without some breath-taking performances and scenes however. The parts that were executed quite well and done correctly were nothing short of just incredible. Explosions were nicely detailed, the tension was high, everything looked realistic where it should and the idea behind the setting was great. Personally, I found myself in awe in questioning the true motive of the movie, would you gladly accept to be a slave for technology, or pay to control the slaved technology? Overall, the movie had some very high points, then some very low points, with a good message wrapped in there. I only cannot rate it higher for the simple fact that while I enjoyed it, this movie felt way too much in one package. Had it been given a proper chance to slowly evolve through another movie, even two before reaching the climax, I could see it much more accepted. Unfortunately, it did not turn out that way.My verdict is ultimately a 6/10, a rent for those who wanted to see it will probably enjoy it enough once to merit a rental.",Gamer
171,jblacktree,Pure Film,10,9 July 2010,"Reading IMDb reviews in 2010 reminds me of reading reviews of Welles, Hawks, Ford, Hitchcock, Sirk and others by American and English ""experts"" before the French came along. Or reviews of 70s films before Tarantino rescued them. A film isn't plot, words, characterization, a linear original narrative. That stuff comes in your How-to script books and makes me shudder. A film is images, sounds,colors, and the syntax of a film has no relation to ""what happened"" but HOW things happen. Kane is a masterwork because of how it's made, not because it addresses the life of a newspaper fascist. Gamer is shot so that it occurs viscerally, with great speed, sometimes beauty, often wit, and its intentions are never overswamped by an impulse to preach or teach.

The gameplay could be detalised and expanded as well as the lifestory of the Kable (maybe in a gladiator-way. Same thing about the interaction between the player and a character.

I've just come back from a screening of gamer and i gotta say this is the action film of the summer. The film takes place in the not so distant future where virtual reality gaming is being taken to the next level. They're not controlling your typical cg characters but real people this time around. The film's pacing does not let up at all. I mean the movie was only about an hour and a half long but it is packed with over the top action with blood and gore all over the place. The performances in the movie are also great especially with actors like Gerard Butler, Amber Valetta, Michael C Hall (his performance was the best in my opinion),Kyra Sedgwick and Ludicrous. Now I probably know what you're thinking ""ludacris"" but to tell you the truth he wasn't half bad at all. Now about the action. IT WAS BADASS I mean really every action scene in the movie was top notch,it really matched that feel of an old 80's action flick which i love. and just the way they shot the movie was really interesting since it was from the same directors that did the crank films it had... well i don't know how to explain it but let's just say it was gritty dirty and had that feeling of you're actually there.

The whole story (even though I am a big sci-fi fan) was pretty much nothing new.The bad guy is once again just bad and nothing more, missing any depth of the character.

The action was OK, but the movie was hard to follow, though there wasn't much to follow anyway, and the acting wasn't very good. Add this all up and you get an average piece of crap Hollywood is throwing out these days. If this would have been directed differently, written differently, and shot differently, it would have been excellent. But its pretty terrible.

For example, the part with alchool the main character drinks in order to be able to start a car, is just too much. Ending is also weak, people reaction is bad, the happy ending in totally poor.

Instead I ended up watching what seemed to be a desperate attempt to hook in with the teenager, with cringe worthy moments topped up with languages such as ""epic"" and ""owned"", and a story that's pulled out of someone's ass. the plot is so full of holes to a point where I almost wanted to walk out half way through..

184,christianvillagomez,Had the potential to be one of the most defining movies yet in today's action genre...,5,11 February 2010,"Let's all be honest: the trailer completely hooks us in! It's supplied with that one song ""Sweet Dreams"" that sounds rocking and its lyrics seem to perfectly describe Gamer's main idea while showing lots of thrilling action scenes. And after watching the actual movie, I must say that if you had normal standards for another eh-ish action flick, then this would of satisfied. But in terms of living up to the trailers' standards, then in that case the film was, quoting the infamous gamer term here, AN EPIC FAIL. I know Neveldine/Taylor always try to pride themselves on keeping their action flicks low-budget and that was perfectly exceptional for the ""Crank"" movies. But this movie's aim was much bigger than some British hit man going around on a killing rampage! At times the couple of sweet uses of visual effects (Slayers moments & Ads completely covering buildings) but what we have to get in return for those cool yet very brief moments are lots of normal-length moments where it just involve 2 or more people talking in a room where the direction of Neveldine/Taylor feels really dead. And what really made the movie feel uncomfortable to watch was ""Society"": honestly, even in 2034 I don't think people in general will grow up to be corrupt, drunk and weird sluts! Seriously almost everything in Society was unnecessary and while I'm not saying they should have taken that out but just tone it down A LOT! Plus that was just being pretty stereotypical to make Angie's user a fat, perverted slob. And apparently the film was decided to be a compact hour- and-a-half and that wasn't right for 1 reason: after Kable did all his necessary business (rescuing Angie, having his and her nanotechs buzzed off, yadda yadda yadda) he decides to go to Ken Castle's mansion to settle it once and for all.... but that was just the problem: when he decides to go, he gets there no questions asked! They should have devoted at least 10 minutes to Castle's technical team trying to hunt him down or something like that.So that's all Gamer: a high-budget idea supported by a lousy low-budget, had the potential to put in scenes that could have made the movie (as a whole) flow much more easily, and just in general considered to me as good half of the times only.",Gamer
185,bobslider,Gamer captures the worst of the digital age,2,24 November 2009,"Gamer is a movie about a technology that allows people to control other people through a neural interface. Basically this means shadowy colorless basement ugly people puppeting attractive people around in the real world. Think sims with real people, and I guess somehow these people get a thrill watching things unfold vicariously. For some reason this technology has seemingly taken over the entire world, though it is portrayed as almost disgustingly abhorrent. The technology has spread to a new area which is the real life version of a first person shooter. Death row inmates (who are always used for these weird futuristic TV show games) are controlled by people and if they get their avatar through 30 matches, the death row inmate walks free. The big bad guy who's winning all the matches is Kable, who only has 2 matches to go, and knows some super secrets about the billionaire bill gates type who invented the technology. Really this movie is filled with holes. Who gets to control a death row inmate in these fights? I assume there aren't thousands of these battles going on every month, allowing every pimply kid to get his own player, so how did the 17 year old kid who controls Kable get the reins? Why does Kable get all the credit if he's being completely controlled by this kid? Where are the floating cameras that follow cable wherever he goes, allowing the kid to play him video game style? How expensive must this lifestyle game be to control real people - if you had to pay to play real people sims characters, the price would be astronomical, especially since these human avatars are limited to young, attractive people. The problem is that this is essentially a science fiction storyline, but told by a rabid Michael Bay/Tony Scott fan who has no time for details, just time to shake the camera and explode everything. Even in slower scenes the camera jigs and jogs like it's being held by a crack addict waiting for his next fix. The tone of the movie is all wrong, the villain exists in a semi dark comedic nightmare, and the hero is the earnest, just wants his family back humorless avenger. When they meet, the movie goes into an orgasm of complete stupidity, and the ending takes your brain and shoves it into a garbage disposal. There are some sad pointless little cameos by John Leguizamo, Keith David, and the guy from heroes. Michael C Hall is a bit cringe-worthy as the villain with a wispy southern accent that seems to come and go. The real star of this film for me was Amber Valletta's ass.",Gamer

188,Damester17,The Reason Not to play Sims.,7,4 September 2009,"You want action you got action and then some. We are going to break this film down into several parts Drive, story, delivery, and message. Bare with me I am still trying to determine a proper format for film commentary. Look at this film gamer its a great movie as far as game related films go. It had that drive that was derived from the action that pushed the story without faltering or coming off as filler. Although action was the drive it was not always front and foremost when the time came the action drifted to the bottom and became the undercurrent on which other aspects of the film would ride on. And ride on that undercurrent is exactly what the story of this film did. It left a few open ended questions like where exactly everything took place, when, how did one gain access to control a player and a myriad of other questions that could have been answered with a next to no story telling. The story was a familiar format action history conflict twist climax and resolution. But without telling too much about the film I can say the story leaves a bit to be desired. But the execution was magnificent the directors made sure to dig into the literal gaming world and pull out various aspects of it that the gaming demographic would recognize. First few scenes there are some classic fps tea bagging and crouch jumping. And during the Sim like scenes it brought up many things that players actually do when playing seems and you definitely feel that if your Sims really had a mind in the real game there would be a few issues with playing the game. For the demographic the movie lacked some comedic packaging and that fact really effects my view of the message of the film.What I think of the message is neither here nor there. But I do think highly of this movie even if it will keep me from enjoying Sims for some time to come. I believe the film is a satire maybe not in it's entirety but in some parts on humanity. The film pokes and prods at us and how morbid we can become when we are able to detach from the experience of murder, bloodshed, and carnage. How as we pursue a better gaming experience and story lines of ethics can become blurred very much an allusion to roman gladiators and Colosseum if you ask me.",Gamer

Sadly it could have been a good movie, as it had an original idea. However I honestly believe that I could create a better movie using u tube clips. And it would have a better plot lol. What we ended up wasting our money to see was.... and hour and a half of silliness. Horrible plot, horrible acting, horribly directed as you never really get enough of a chance to get to like/or dislike any of the characters in it. I've enjoyed watching my brother play call of duty online more than watching this load of crap. Anyone that liked this is borderline retarded. One of the bigger disappointments in the past couple of years.",Gamer
190,aliciamcmurren,Gamer (entertainment of Virtual reality bloodshed),10,22 January 2021,Slayers a game where a player plays a prisioner and if they survive the term time served. Only thing is this prisioner is looking to controller to free him before his time is allowed. He is going to another world where people play real people who live in a contract to download. This film is action and storyline is killer.,Gamer
191,Interrogangbang,It's not The Matrix.,3,1 November 2009,"The concept of Gamer has potential, no doubt about that. The film is set in a dystopical future where humans control other humans in SecondLife, an online gaming community. Society is basically a more developed and R-rated version of The Sims, whereas Slayer is a war game in which death-row convicts battle each other out in hopes of looming freedom (if you survive 30 games, you're pardoned). The most famous Slayer-player is a teenage boy who controls Kable (Butler's character), who at 27 wins is closer to earning his freedom than anyone before him. All he wants is to be re-united with his wife (played blankly by Valletta) and child to live happily ever after.Sounds reasonably original, huh? The virtual gaming world offers limitless opportunities for fascinating storytelling, and the cast is quite impressive (who didn't love Butler in 300?). And it's not just him and Michael C. Hall, the supporting actors also bring a whole lot of awesomeness to the table, just watch the lovely John Leguizamo making skillful use of his short screen time as Kable's fellow inmate. Even Marilyn Manson's cover of Sweet dreams blasting from the loudspeakers during opening credits bodes well of what's to come.So where, exactly, does it all go wrong? The script by the directing duo has a lot of the blame to take. The main issue is the fact that the story moves away from SecondLife way too quickly, because let's face it - that's 90% of what makes this movie interesting (the remaining 10% is Butler's six-pack). After that it's just an illogical mess of one action scene after the other, science mumbojumbo that would make Stephen Hawking wet his pants with laughter and a megalomaniac nerd who wants to rule the world for no apparent reason.The second problem is the duration. At a humble running time of 1.5 hours there's no time for any character development, and the viewer ends up having no empathy for our main hero, nor any understanding of the motivations behind the antagonist's actions. By the end of the film you even forget that some of the characters were there to begin with. The final scene that everything builds up towards falls flat on it's stomach like a platypus on crack and you end up leaving the theatre wondering what the hell just happened. Very unsatisfying indeed.It's a pity that everything that is wrong with this movie completely manages to overshadow the good bits. Gamer totally nails it when it comes to cinematography, and visually the movie is nothing short of stunning. There are also many clever futuristic details, and even the soundtrack is well thought out (which leaves us hoping the same patience and effort would've been applied to the storyline). Unfortunately none of these things help relief the irritation the viewer feels as the plot starts to ""unveil"". The suggested moral of the story, completely wasted on the target audience, doesn't help either.Gamer has the potential for four stars at least, but due to forgettable characters, clumsy writing and the lack of a decent plot I'm only giving it 3/10. An original idea within the action genre is a rarity, and it's a shame to see it so terribly wasted.",Gamer
192,movieauditors,Better with Beer,6,6 May 2010,"There are some films a manly man MUST watch. For instance, films starring any of the following (let me know if I left someone out):*They have their momentsAl Pacino Antonio Banderas* Christian Bale* Chuck Norris Denzel Washington* Ed Harris* Jackie Chan Jason Statham Jeff Bridges* Jet Li Johnny Depp* Jude Law* Mel Gibson* Robert De Niro Russell Crowe* Steven Seagal Sylvester Stallone Tom Cruise Wesley Snipes...and now, Gerard Butler.So instinctively, when I saw that the badass who played Leonidas in ""300"" was in Neveldine & Taylor's (the creators of Crank I & II) latest action film, I tore my shirt off and dragged some hot Indian chick to movie theater with me.All in all, it wasn't bad, bad. The gore and action scenes were pretty decent. If you're a gamer, then some of the ""Slayer"" scenes and environments will remind you of Killzone or Gears of War. Unfortunately, most of the bloodshed scenes could not fully be appreciated because of some nauseating camera-work and editing. However, one thing that can fully be ""appreciated"" in this film, is the salacity of women, as the movie's death toll was stalked closely by its boob count (HEADSHOT, titty, HEADSHOT, titty...). And that's about it. This film lacks in just about every other category (acting, plot, etc.) and matters are only complicated by the film's identity crisis. I mean, Gamer was about only four titties and a sex scene away from being an action, comedy, drama, musical porno. But then again, the film's various appeals to different emotions or genres could have been the result of the movie's episodic presentation. Ex. scenes starring Gerard Butler (as John 'Kable' Tillman) are almost strictly hardcore action with the occasional dramatic flashback, while scenes starring Michael C. Hall (as the eccentric Ken Castle) are of the musical comedy variety. It's a cool concept, but I think it undermines the plots fluency and coherency. So if you enjoy titties, watching the spraying of blood, and bullets shredding through flesh, then check it out.Grade (Inebriated): B+ Grade (Sober): D+-Marticus (http://movieauditors.blogspot.com/)",Gamer

It brings up many interesting points and makes us ask questions about where humanity is going. While it is slightly rushed here and there and the ending could be better for the most part it is a great sci i action thriller. In my opinion one of Gerald Butler's best roles. The whole concept of real people's deaths being glorified does show that humanity as a whole is sometimes a terrible culture, glorifying violence and death of the criminals. also the other reality game, Society is i believe a metaphor for human trafficking. So it is a great film with stunning effects and a good plot however slightly rushed.",Gamer

Take a movie for what it is.This film isn't a brilliant piece of art, it probably won't move you, it won't make you think all that much - but it will damn well entertain you. From the opening credits featuring Marilyn Manson's ""Sweet Dreams"" to the end credits I was captivated the entire time. Great soundtrack, very appealing to the eyes and of course I love the concept behind it all. The way we're heading with all this virtual reality bs, it's not too far off, hey? The ""sad"" aspect reminded me of Surrogates somewhat. Pity it had to have typical Hollywood elements - but you can get over that! If you liked this, check out Series 7.

196,twistedmetal1412,Gamer sets out to entertain.. and succeeds,8,11 November 2009,"Gamer, as the rating currently shows, doesn't seem to look like an impressive movie - people complaining left right and center about the dialogues and the unbelievable storyline. I watched this with no expectations. I have to say, I commend the effort. I throughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish. Gerard Butler does a really good job in portraying Kable - his controller the 17 year old Simon, played by Logan Lerman who didn't really have much to do but play the stereotypical spoiled rich 17 year old kid. To be fair, his bit of the storyline was a bit dodgy - when you watch the movie you'll see what I mean when you finally think about it. Michael C. Hall excels in his part as Ken Castle, the deranged millionaire, shall we say. The performances weren't bad in this movie in the least, so I actually don't know what everyone's complaining about. Ludicrous, Amber Valetta, and all the co stars did more or less enough to bring out their characters, but the length of the movie didn't really allow for the showcasing for their talents.Which begs the question what the movie really is. Well, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you, it's definitely not a story oriented film. The story is SOUND enough to keep the intellectual viewer interested.Gamer is an all out, bloody, violent and macabre film - most of the time, it's just fighting, fighting, and more fighting. A couple of times we also have the nudity showing up - sometimes quite unnecessarily, but mostly it's just fighting.Mindless violence, too, mind you, people dying randomly everywhere, blood spattered, heads rolling(literally), and a gruesome experience overall.Why do I like it so much then? I'm not one to disagree that I cringe watching violent movies(I'm yet to watch Zombieland because of that) but there is a very simple, and scary, maybe slightly overdone premise about Gamer that I like.It carries itself in violent style, bringing out what our first person shooters would look like in reality. This is a subtle message to all gamers, in my opinion, from the directors - that nothing is as rosy as it seems, or rather, we need to take such things seriously, as Simon seems not to, until Kable reminds him that ""these are real f***ing people"".The execution was far from mediocre - for a movie attempting to look like a first person shooter, it wasn't bad in the least. The cinematography was a bit dizzying, but being a fan of first person shooters myself, I'm sort of used to the crazy camera movements (not this crazy though but you get my idea). The fundamental use of ""ping"" was what impressed me the most - I shuddered to imagine what a delay in command could mean to a real life human out there, playing your character in a game, blood, guts, gore. As Kable points out, ""That half a second could be the difference between life and death."" And maybe I'm going too gaga over this film. But I truly thought that for what it was worth, Gamer sets out to achieve what it wanted to - to entertain. The acting was far from bad, the graphics and the cinematography was realistic enough(if not difficult) and the premise was sound - which is essentially what I personally care about when I watch a movie, because I don't care if the dialogues are crap(unless it's really bad, of course) as long as they're delivered appropriately, and the cast manages it just fine. And I don't care how the movie is executed as long as it tells me what it really wants to do, and that is, to entertain. I know some people were even disappointed with the amount of ""entertainment"" that this movie seemed to provide but honestly, any more and this would have become Transformers 2 where the last fight went on for at least an hour before the damn debacle ended? I'm not so sure, gosh that was a nightmare.So, my honest advice to all of you is to watch this movie regardless of the rating. You aren't wasting any of your money IF you are going to watch this without expectations. Gerard Butler and Michael C. Hall are good actors(just watch Dexter) and they really don't fail to deliver the goods on this movie, and the costars are competent enough. Don't get put off by critical reviewers who'd pick on every single aspect of this movie as if it was Slumdog Millionaire which won 10 Oscars. It's just good action, not a bad story, decent acting.And why did I give it an 8 on 10? That's because, when a movie manages not to excel itself on certain aspects,then there isn't an element of disappointment that the other things could have been better. In other words, this movie was good in all aspects, and for that consistency, I give it an 8 on 10. Two thumbs up for Gamer, catch this either in the cinema, or if you read this too late, on DVD.",Gamer

The villains must be curvy and strong enough to give a big fight thats what every film is generally expected to give a boosting effect to the audience.. some part of the film was not at all getting in the brains, now don't blame my brains for it..

201,Robert_Nijman,The Running Man For The YouTube Generation,8,16 September 2009,"Going into this movie, I wasn't really expecting a lot. I had only seen one short preview, which made it look like any other post-Running Man fight-your-way-out-of-trouble action flick that sees the protagonist trapped in a game show-like fantasy, going through army's of bad guys like Pacman through so many of those little pills. I didn't know however, that Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, the writer/director duo that brought us Crank and Crank: High Voltage, were at the helm of Gamer. The first minutes of the movie made that distinctly clear, though, as high powered action and fast paced kinetic camera-work introduce us to the world of Slayer, a first-person shooter that has its inmate characters live and die at the control(s) of real world gamers. Movements of both players and camera and the feel of the game are right on the money if you've ever seen shooters like Counterstrike or Call of Duty.The world of Gamer is a not too distant future where Castle, an overnight software giant shying the likes of Microsoft and Google, reigns supreme. Its young manager, media mogul Ken Castle, couldn't be more offspring of Generation X or Michael C. Hall's joyfully overacted and clearly Dexter-based part would be played by Coupland himself. The immense riches brought on by his revolutionary gaming technologies make him a have-it-all loner who has lost all contact with the everyday reality spawned by Taylor and Neveldine. The virtual world is slowly replacing the tangible one, as more and more people hook on to games like Society, where you get to control an actual human being in a more-or-less fictional setting, best described as Sims at a Mad Max-themed rave, dressed by Brüno. It is in these aspects that the directors are at their best, using internet and other digital references to portray these future playgrounds, hyper technological media and the next generation of adult entertainment. The kind of future not quite as dark as the one imagined by Orwell, but pretty scary nonetheless, like we're all trapped in the Ministry of Virtual Reality.If Castle's virtual world Society laid the first bricks for his soon-to-be world dominating company, second invention Slayer certainly paved the rest of the way, captivating a loyal audience the world over. The hero of the game is Kable (a contemporary Ben Richards if you will), or John Tillman outside the map of the game, played by Gerard Butler. A prison inmate who gets a fighting chance for parole, if he successfully completes thirty missions in Slayer. Which means the seventeen-year-old professional gamer that controls him has to beat a world full of other gamers, most notably Terry Crews' Hackman, an all-killing, all-dancing beast of man, whose impressive physique (neck), short singing routine ('I haven't got any strings') and the fact there's no-one in the real world controlling him make him more fierce than Dynamo, Fireball and Buzzsaw combined. Rich background casting is provided as well, seeing supporting parts for Ludicrous, John Leguizamo, Alison Lohman, Milo Ventimiglia and Keith David, among others (although some in a blink-and-you'll-miss-'em capacity), but this is clearly an all-out Butler-show. Quite possibly due to the fact the makers intended to put moviegoers into the perspective of his character as well.Tillman's wife (Amber Valletta) and daughter on the outside are what keep him going, but we soon find out he hides an important secret as well; one that Castle would very much like to remain hidden. In the end, that gambit combined with the somewhat rushed climax are what amount to Gamer falling short of being a true original, but other than that I highly recommend you go see this movie. The extremely detailed look at a possible future makes it eerily clear we may be closer to an alternative 1984 than we are past it.",Gamer
202,abstract_karma,Embarrassing...,3,8 September 2010,"I don't know where to begin.. It'd take me longer than the movies runtime to describe how truly awful Gamer is. Gamer is basically an amalgam of The Running Man (even to the point of having a character named Ben Richard), Johnny Mnemonic (with Ludicrous (sic) in a carbon-copy role of Ice-T) with a touch of Robocop (directive 4), but at least it gets to mention 'tea-bagging' (yay?).From the offset the movie looks and feels like it has been written by a horny 13 year old, and it's all down hill from there. The story and story-telling are poor, the characters one dimensional and the script abysmal. Why anyone agreed to be involved in this picture is beyond me, especially when the supporting cast consists of John Leguizamo, Kyra Sedgewick and Keith David, all solid performers on their day.If you want to see a film about games/virtual reality, you'd be far better off watching The Lawnmower Man, TRON or eXistenZ, or waiting for the upcoming TRON: Legacy. On the other hand, if you want to see a rehash of some of my favourite tongue-in-cheek sci-fi movies (but without the story) then be my guest....but don't say I didn't warn you.3/10 (purely for the mention of tea-bagging)",Gamer
203,steveo151500,a fun action movie worthy of being seen on the big screen,7,4 September 2009,"Most people enjoy video games. I know I do. Since I got my XBOX 360, I've been devoting a great deal of my time to HALO 3 on XBOX LIVE, time that I should be spending being more social. But in this dark and disturbing vision of the future, the world of online gaming pretty much destroys our moral judgement. I was going to play HALO 3 after I saw this movie and I don't think I want to play video games for a week.This is Mark Neveldine & Brian Taylor's third film together, their first two being the ridiculous but fun CRANK and it's way-over-the-top-but-so-much-fun sequel, and I have to say that it's a lot of fun. This one could take place in the same universe as those movies. This movie is a combination of last summers DEATH RACE and Arnold Schwarzenegger's THE RUNNING MAN. Here, we have Gerard Butler who hasn't kicked this much ass since 300. He plays Kable, a convict who participates in the deadly game of SLAYERS where he is controlled by a gamer, played by Logan Lerman. Kable is close to winning his freedom but Ken Castle, played by DEXTER's Michael C. Hall, is in no position to allow that to happen.This movie works not only as a fun action film, but also as a social commentary on online gaming and how far it can go. There are some really disturbing scenes where a gamer controls a woman to go around places and have sexual encounters with people. It's scary to think that one of those people who spends the day sitting in a chair in front of 6 flat screens will watch this movie on some website and see those scenes and have the desire to control real people to do whatever they want. The thought of it sickens me. Also, the fact that human beings no longer have any sense of morality makes this more disturbing.Aside from all of these aspects of the film, the action scenes deliver. The scenes are really flashy and edited in a frenetic style but I'm not criticizing the film. I really dig Neveldine/Taylor's direction here as I did with CRANK and CRANK 2. These guys are really good at making something for a small amount of money and still making it kickass. The film looks amazing as well. I really bought into this world and it's amazing to see that being This movie does have it flaws of course, but no one should go into this to expect a great piece of science fiction. I think that it's worth seeing in the theater but only if you watched the ads and really want to see it. Overall, it's a great rental and definitely worth check out on BLU-RAY. It's not as fun as CRANK 2 was, nor was it as ridiculous and over the top, but it's pure adrenaline fun. It's nice to see that Neveldine/Taylor have tried to do something different from the CRANK movies. They don't have just one card trick to show us. I am really looking forward to seeing what these guys try to do next. I'm also curious to see what these guys would do with a really budget.",Gamer

I kept reminding myself that it is only 90 minutes long to get through it.I'll list a few of the low lights, but trust me, the whole is MUCH worse than the sum of the flaws.The premise makes no sense. The hero is lauded for his skill in surviving more battles than anyone else who has played the game, but he is being controlled by a 17 year old. Who's really in charge here?

Gerard Butler's performance was okay for this one but other actors/actresses are simply there to move the plot along and one thing I hate the most about this movie is that everything seems to be broken. The lights were on and off all the time, the camera shaking all the time and I don't know maybe some people like this kind of things but I simply don't, it makes me nauseous. Other than that, the story was unusual I might say because the idea of human controlling other humans in multi-player online gaming is weird. I have to be honest, I came with high expectations (though not as high as The Dark Knight or even District 9) and was hugely disappointed by nearly every aspects of this movie.

I really liked Simon's game room, the way he flipped through menus -opening/closing/browsing through them just by moving his arms/hands through air. This in-fact is going to be real pretty soon - researchers at MIT are developing similar space oriented menus that can be flipped around by a stroke of the hand.The movie has excessive/uncalled for nudity also the idea of brain chip serving as a receptor and it irreversibly altering your cell structure is pretty creepy and far-fetched.

Gamer burns an image of humanities values, trends, and weaknesses as we move inevitably forward in this technological revolution.I think we all know (and hope) mind control or anything of the like of this is far off into our future. The movie isn't trying to make you believe this could happen but painting the images of how we are as a society using the technology we have and how our emerging disconnect from reality is altering our moral compasses.Gamer has plenty of action and effects to satisfy the action enthusiast while adding a touch of the oddity and creativeness of a cult classic. You don't have to be a hard core gamer get the satire but if you have played a few games online or own an Xbox360 you will either be able to identify directly or at least associate the scenarios with someone you've played with before.My wife and I are GenX-Y so we're comfortable with the concepts and I think we might have been the target audience for this movie. The plot is no more complicated then your standard ""Running Man"" or ""Death Race"" but where it hit us was in the imagery. Days later after we saw the film we were still talking about it elaborating with our own revelations on society and in some ways creeped out about the concepts.

ALL THE SCENES WERE DARK AND HAD It was hard to see ANYTHING AT ALL!!!! Cinematography was horrible, Lighting was bad, Acting was bad and the script was terrible just terrible! It was really fast paced and stupid! Characters went off screen or died, I wouldn't know because filming of the movie sucked! Once I saw characters for a few minutes that were important to the plot they would soon disappear within a matter of minutes. EVERYONE WAS SO MELODRAMATIC! I really really did not like this movie! It was so bad it was horrible and I am glad it was only an hour and 30 minutes, I cannot stand to watch 2 hours of this! Get better actors and film crew, rewrite the script, film it better and have some damn lighting! This movie is a horrible piece of crap disaster... DO NOT see this movie. It has no point or entertainment what so ever!... A really bad movie....",Gamer

Well after the first half hour I decided that MCH is the good guy, although you hardly ever see him. He's funny, you get his background story very early on in the movie, and he's just a lovable character. But then I realized that the guy on the cover, how's that for a character, is the good guy. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, you know nothing about him, he's only funny when he gets drunk, and he doesn't have an awesome Broadway background showing it's face. Plus he kills the only good actor in this movie at the end:,(. It should have been the other way around",Gamer

In an effort to present a murky, evil ""sense"" of the movie, they darkened it as is often done in movies such as these. Also, the shaky-cam-effect needs to disappear FOREVER. The actors were great (I think I have seen all of Gerard Butler's movies). We really enjoyed the musical score, also. Did this movie seem to have political (conservative) undertones? Perhaps that's why we liked it. ""Avatar"" had such a strong political (liberal) message, that my husband and I walked out of the theater. That was a shame, because it was so WELL-LIGHTED :)",Gamer

Starting a truck using vomit and urine as fuel? Give me a break... The dialogue seemed to come as smoothly as a sandpaper washcloth, and Gerard Butler just seemed to want it to be over with.

Not at all at good sides or bad sides, it just made me confused.Confused in one line: anyone wont like this movie. It is a fact, I know. You know! The idea was really cool. Everyone should agree with that BUT the way it is executed is that the majority would disagree.The movie starts cool. We see battles, shots, explosions, booms and kabooms. Very nice, yeah! We love these stuffs! We love explosions, cars and people flying, buildings under destruction and etc. Yes, this movie shows it, but shows us with a ""ping"". Damm low ping! Also known as LAG in the gaming world. Yeah! It turns to be boring, a lag in the really nice scenes. Like in the games. It ruins the film (but not to everyone) If you want to see this movie just for the action ONLY (that is well done with very good computer effects), Don't SEE IT. Its not worth, you'll waste your time. That is my words. This is the reality.The movie has an other side. Not call it as a ""black side"" but the """"""truth side"""""" in the gaming world. Yes! We have people that is exactly the same way the movie shows us trough. The movie shows us people being something they aren't in real life and they find a virtual personality in a game one. We have the pro players (the slayers) and just noobs, not noobs from newbies but dumbies. This what the movies was trying to show, I think... trying to show theirs acts about something. Something like these. I will not tell you the whole movie.The action was great. Ludicrous is total LOL. Butler worked fine. Peter (from Heroes) was bad, bad in a way that is not him, based on his traditional char. The chars were fine.My opinion about the whole plot, as the majority of the people, is: 5/10 My opinion as open-minded: 8/10 8 + 5 = 13 / 2 = 6.5 ... I will give it 6 !",Gamer

The funny thing is, the film actually has potential but gets caught up in it's own self-indulgent ways. I really felt bad for Michael C. Hall and Gerard Butler. Two very talented actors who obviously had no idea what they were signing up for. I kept wondering, ""Why on Earth was this movie greenlit""?

Instead of a 'first person' perspective, they have incorporated the 'real person' perspective. Games take control of real people in their games.Apart from our hero, every single other human being seem to have lost any empathy or humanism. Although this may be intentional, it just feels like a clinical, one dimensional style of story telling. Nothing rings true.The look and feel of the movie tries too hard to look like a video game. It takes the worst fears of the online world and smears them across our faces. There is no balance, no leeway. Everything is labeled as bad; depraved sex and extreme violence being singled out. This movie makes no sense. Nothing makes sense. The dialogue is atrocious, the editing is lousy, the 'world' portrayed is ridiculous.

Frankly, I have no idea why people agreed to work on this film.EVERYTHING in this movie is bad. Even the great Michael C. Hall acts like a complete moron the whole time. I think they paid him A LOT of money to do this gig, because I cannot think of any other reason why he would humiliate himself like this.Some movies are so bad that they can actually entertain you a bit (especially if you watch with your friends and laugh about it the entire time).

221,calevenice,an abstract view of how users interact with their avatars,7,6 September 2009,"The movie was fairly good. Even though slayers should have been more defined, it did explain the basics of it (make it to the save point alive). The movie being ""abstract"" worked very well for everything besides the slayers sequences, but those were surprisingly short. Something that I thought they did very well though is showing how the user interacts with their character. In MMO's today, you have a-holes who will screw up other people's fun and during one of the society scenes, there is an example of this with the roller blading. Its made even more powerful by people laughing at other people 's injuries, disgracing of dead bodies, etc. because its the icons (avatars) getting abused, not the users.From an academic standpoint, this movie is great since it shows off how sick and uncaring people can be when its not their bodies being abused or shot at.Anyways, if you want to see this movie, I warn you that there it is rated R for good reasons. It made me think that they should separate the R-rating into R1 and R2 or R and RR. This is because many R movies are lite-R's (some swearing, some nudity, some blood, but nothing out-of-control so to speak) and many other R movies are heavy-R's (i.e. saw, many cheesy horror flicks, and this movie)",Gamer

Other wonderful moments include the climax in which there is a giant, gaping, plot the size of the director's ego. (The directors also wrote/directed the classic 'Crank' films) I can't help but wonder if Gerard Butler got the script, then looked to his agent, back at the script, then back to his agent and laughed while saying, ""really? I mean, really?"" Okay okay, so the opening is action packed and cool, but the story just doesn't really kick in and at the climax of the film you care about nothing but getting out of the theater to go rent a movie you'll actually want to see.

224,magnum_pt,Misleading Trailers,4,25 March 2010,"The trailers for Gamer portray a movie full of action, violence, and good versus evil. And while it does contain all of these elements, they are overshadowed by the film's rampant, needless use of nudity and irritating camera work. Gamer's plot and questions regarding morality have great potential. But they are drowned out by scene after scene of gratuitous nudity and vulgarity. The characters had little development, which lead to me not getting attached to them. Michael C. Hall, arguably a phenomenal actor, makes only a few appearances. The action shots were filmed with lots of cuts, giving the scenes the feel of an overlong trailer. The parts involving Gerard Butler being ""played"" were few and far between, and proved to be the most interesting scenes of the movie.All in all, if you want a movie with action, violence, and questions about morality in our society, rent District 9. Gamer should have went straight to video.",Gamer
225,joene90,Could've been way better,4,13 October 2009,"Alright, I wanted to see this movie so bad because the trailer looked bad ass. The idea of controlling an actual living and breathing game character was cool, and that's what the movie should've been about. It should've been about playing the game, huge battles and pure awesomeness.Obviously, it wasn't. This movie was all about what happened BEHIND the game. The gamer playing the character wasn't really important to the story, it was all about Kable and what happened to him AFTER he won the thirty games. With an extremely thin storyline they should've just ended the movie with a couple of limbs flying around and Kable getting killed or surviving the thirty games in a row.There were two ways of making this movie into a success. One: make it about the game, nothing more. Two: hire a story-writer to do the rest of the story. Make some awesome twists, keep the tension, and use the incredibly good options you have to make a masterpiece. Stretch the movie out for another hour and you could've done so much more.Now it's just sad, the only reason this movie is getting 4 / 10 is because of the pretty solid acting.",Gamer
226,SkipperCupcake,Quite a Disappointment for Gerard Butler Fans.,1,18 March 2010,"I drove myself insane to get to see this movie simply because Gerard Butler's movies are known to impress, however this one did not do the work for me and as a matter of fact I was disgusted and disappointed by the whole movie, the contents, the screenplay, the storyline, the details themselves were horrible. It was a slight imitation of Michael Bay's The island, yet inspired by the computer game second life, and pornography itself. I watched the movie hoping something interesting and good would happen soon only to get to the credits thinking ""is this is? "".I'm sorry but I hope that in the near future, Gerard starts picking more interesting movies, and characters, because even if he is a wonderful actor, the actors don't turn movies into popular blockbusters, their plots do and Gerard is made for such plots, not some perverted kids play.To add up to my few opinions and pointers, my admiration for Milo Ventimiglia was slightly shattered by his image in this movie. He was merely in it for a couple of small scenes which does surprise me for an actor well known as him (though many actors were only in the movie for little scenes as well), yet the role given to him (and to many others) only makes it impossible to bare even looking at his face ever again without feeling disgusted. I am sorry but the characters in that movie (besides the few that did make a difference like Kable and Simon) weren't quite very interesting to see, only disgusting and somewhat annoying.",Gamer
227,Deadpool2692,This movie is disappointing.,3,6 September 2009,"The story line is exceptable, but it could have been a lot better. The action scene are too brief and confusing, basically Gerard Butler just ran around shooting some people and then there's an explosion. There's nothing creative in the action scene at all. This movie has a lot of nudity but has no point for showing it. And the thing that I hate the most about this movie is the blurry and shaky camera technique. So to sum it all up, I had a horrible experience watching this movie. I'm sure a lot of gamer and teenager will love this movie. I'm a gamer too but not a hardcore one, and I still hated this movie. * The ending scene with Micheal C. Hall singing ""I've got you under my skin"" is so stupid*",Gamer
228,unkommon2001-3,Unexpectedly Good,8,6 September 2009,"When I saw the trailer for Gamer, I didn't really want to see. In fact, I thought the movie was going to be garbage, based on what I had gathered about it. The only thing that made me go see this movie, was the fact that it was written/directed by the same people people as Crank (Neveldine/Taylor) So, going to see Gamer, I wasn't expecting much, if anything. However, the explosiveness and uniqueness of the first scene was really intriguing, and it got me really interested into seeing the outcome of the whole movie. The fact that an action movie, these days, could do that to me, should say enough.Apart from the fact that Gamer is an interesting action film, there are many other great things about it. For instance: the visuals were incredible, which is expected from the trailer; the plot is pretty original, in the fact that there are, somewhat, unforeseen twists; the acting, based on the cast, should speak for itself, Gerard Butler and Michael C. Hall were more than outstanding; it was extremely far out, I've seen Crank, and to me, that was one of the strangest movies that I had seen, but Crank is put to shame when that factor is compared with Gamer's, in fact, this movie is the probably closest thing to a sober acid trip there is; and the character development, it was so ridiculous, but it works great for some of the characters, and poorly for other characters.Conversely, this movie did have its fair share of problems. Such as: predictability, I could have pretty much called what was going to happen in the scene, based on the first 10 seconds of it, but at the same time, there were some unexpected parts; Ludicrous,I just hated him in the movie, even though he was a protagonist, I really wanted him to be shot in the face... even though his acting wasn't too bad; in its craziness, I think it was a bit too far out, especially expecting what I was expecting after the trailer; and the character development, apart from being great for some characters, and poor for other characters, for every other single person, they're just insignificant, and they're tried as ""important"" characters, like Ludicrous's character, but it just doesn't work, at all.All in all, if its flaws are overlook, Gamer can be a really great movie, exactly like Crank, except more far out and intriguing. If not easily offended, or disgusted, or upset, go see this movie! It's worth it!",Gamer
229,samday88,300 + Crank = a good action movie,5,4 September 2009,"Well, I looked forward to this movie for some time, it was what I expected very violent. C Michael Hall (Dexter), seemed to be the only person that really fit their role in the movie. Ludicrous was ludicrous, and Kyra Sedgwick (the Closer) seemed like more of a bit part than a character that added any substance to the movie. Gerald Bulter (300), played the action figure Kable and was more of a superhero than a mortal. Lots of really good actors make cameos like John Leguizamo (The Freak) and Milo Ventimiglia (Heroes) but lend nothing to the overall feel of the movie, and in most cases distract from the overall flow of the movie. With the total action and very easy to guess story line it does not take a genius to figure out what happens next. It is mildly entertaining but lacks something that would make it breakthrough.....Have fun but don't expect a lot of acting to happen in this flick.",Gamer

I don't understand why the wrong audience is commenting on this one. For example when someone doesn't like chick flicks, he just don't watch them! If you liked death race then I'd definitely recommend this. This movie ain't similar to Crank as the other person claimed..Gamer rolls on nice graphics and storyline.

Basically the idea of the movie Gamer is an old one in movies, and in human history. Prisoners on death row can compete for the voyeuristic pleasure of the viewing masses, to the death, to perhaps with their freedom. The sci-fi twist to this one is that they are doing it in video game form, where nanobytes control the prisoners brainzzzz and the zit-faced video game players control the prisoners.The movie stars King Leonidas (who is definitely still Sparta) who is just a pawn in the dirty corporate game for human control fueled by the maniacal greed of . David from Six Feet Under, aka Dexter, aka Michael C. Hall. There's really no point in me talking about the quality of acting or anything else, because it's mainly straight-up action. And the fact that I don't want to talk about the quality of acting is a blessing for Ludicrous, who has bumbled his way into another movie.John Leguizamo is in this doing his best RAINMAN impersonation, and is desperately in need of a tooth-brushing. Kyra Sedgwick also is in this playing the role of well I wasn't sure what purpose her character served. And when I look at her all I can think about is how she has sexytimes with Kevin Bacon. I don't know, these thoughts are in my head. Don't judge.King Leonidas is great at the action sequences, but I need him and some of his spartans to tie down the cinematographer for this movie and scream at them that shaking the camera a lot does not equate massive awesome action for me. Just have them fight each other. Stage combat. Please.You have to totally suspend disbelief that the government would allow this program, and that the neuroscience makes any sense whatsoeverbut that's easy to do and I was not bored watching this. Watching a guy kick ass constantly is still very fun for me. The scenes were cool and not completely CGIed like in a lot of action movies nowadays. PS to the costume designers did you just raid the leftovers from the sets of The Fifth Element and Hackers? Or just the raver movement from 1996 in general? If you are looking for plain old forgettable action this weekend, go see Gamers. I give it three out of five stars. This is with a half-star deduction for not having King Leonidas in this tighty reddies, and a half star bonus for having Q from Star Trek have a cameo.Taken from www.filmsmell.com",Gamer

From start to finish there was nothing but exceedingly weird looking boobs, Gerard Butler breathing like a winded bulldog and a quick, slightly humorous dance number, all amidst an hour and a half of Call of Duty-esquire violence. While I did get quite a confidence boost after realizing my own boobs are much prettier than 90% of those shown in the film, I couldn't wait until it was over so I could go see Inglourious Basterds again.

233,deadisalive-1,Know what you should expect,6,6 September 2009,"My movie philosophy: don't blame a movie for not being what it's not meant to be.To enjoy a movie, you don't need the movie to be amazing, great, or even good (sometimes). You just need to know what you should expect.So what do you expect from gamer? If you want gore, violence, blood, nudity...go ahead and see it. If you want Gerald Butler running around shooting people, fighting people, baring his muscles and looking tough like action heroes do, go ahead and see it. If you want Michael C. Hall playing an evil guy trying to take over the world, and baring his muscles, and even showing off his Broadway background a little bit, go ahead and see it. (but you'd be a little disappointed since he shows up less than you'd expect as this is quite a short movie, only 1.5 hours). Even if you want to see some hot lesbian actions probably imagined by very non-lesbian people, or a cute teenage boy who probably isn't supposed to do anything other than being a cute teenage boy...go ahead and see it.But If you want go in and find some surprise- and twist-filled plot, some complicated multi-layer character development, or some brilliant insight into society or even humanity, then no, don't go see Gamer.The problem is, if you are really expecting the later things I mentioned, I think it's partially you fault that you are going to spend one and a half hour of your precious time sitting in a theater suffering from this movie and then hate it with a passion. Because really, those aren't what Gamer is meant to be, even though some people may actually believe that they are.The reality is that while not what many would call a great (or even good) movie, Gamer could be thoroughly enjoyed, as long as you know what it should be. Because I think it's everything it set out to be. You just need to (maybe grudgingly) accept what it's supposed to be and either enjoy it for what it is, or realize that it's not a movie for your high level of intelligence and ignore it completely.",Gamer

Well, there were certainly all of those elements in the opening minutes of the film, but you have no idea how they relate tot the story. ""Gamber"" has falling into the lazy trend of directing and editing which uses the cop-out that if the camera is moving fast enough, and you pile on as many edits as possible, it might SEEM like a decent action scene. As is always the case with this sloppy approach, you can't really tell what's going on.

You then have philosophy, again, nothing great: does playing video games make you a jaded psychopath? As men condemned to death are dead anyway, why not make it entertaining, and perhaps release them if they are entertaining enough? Again, nothing too deep, and the movie is clear in which side it chooses; so if thinking isn't your thing, don't worry! There's also several references to other movies... Death Race, Gladiator (running sand through your hands, then fighting Caesar at the end), Enter The Dragon at the end, etc. etc.This movie is like a buffet, nothing is exceptionally good, however, put it all together on one plate (BBQ ribs, pep. pizza, mash potatoes, and BBQ beans) and you have a decent meal.

I cannot stress this enough - Don't walk, RUN, Don't drive - DRIVE LIKE YOU STOLE IT to take this DVD back and exchange it for something better (trust me, ANYTHING will be better) Id rather watch a snowy screen for 95 minutes...really. IF you have rented this DVD, I apologize. If not ---- Don't!!",Gamer
241,bboyce-710-353993,Pull your heads in..,8,11 April 2010,"Thankfully I chose to watch this movie before reading all the reviews here. The first two pages of reviews as far as I can tell contain nothing but moaning about what a god-awful film this is. Only it wasn't.In my opinion this movie was - well - great. Watching it without reading about it first allowed me to really get into it and enjoy it. It also makes reading some of your comments rather entertaining; like ""they obviously made this movie to appeal to teenagers that play games with words like epic, owned and ping"" - you're right they should have tried appealing to sheep instead, there's plenty more of them. And by the way, ping is an actual term that was described correctly in the film, also known as latency. It's called relating to your audience which they did brilliantly. Another comment I found funny was ""I had to keep asking my friend 'is this real life or is it still in the game?' "" - seriously, it was not hard to follow at all. I'd be more concerned with your comprehension ability rather than the movie flow. Inappropriate nudity in inappropriate places - sure, I can think of one inappropriately placed scene that contained nudity (near the beginning), but nowhere near the point that I'd write off the movie altogether.All in all it's a great (hell, EPIC) action movie, with a theme and story that a younger audience can appreciate and enjoy. I know I did.",Gamer
242,bmacdonald34,Laughing all the way to the bank,1,9 July 2010,I kind of was in realization but deluded to the fact that actors or entertainers of the world would consider first before entering a life time changing event. So now i realize that there is no hope for us if Butler and Luda decide to take up such pathetic waste of money and time on something as brilliantly poorly made and written than this movie thats right only a genius of failure can pull this one off. If you want to waste money burn it then take photos of that. Call it money burning and if i burnt 1 million dollars more than this would amount to the gamer movie. Shame on real stars taking this to the bank laughing all the way.In summary money is the root of this movie and the root of the worst movie ever made.,Gamer
243,pepnasty76,"Intelligent movie, sometimes misunderstood.",8,30 September 2010,"This movie is very intelligent. Maybe to intelligent. From the beginning I could tell it had a complex storyline, and it is very abstract. You really have to be a serious movie lover to understand it. It's about Kable, a mid controlled player in a game, trying to escape the fate of dying in a game, and freeing family along the way he runs into some interesting twist and turns.I think this movie is to far ahead of it's time for people to appreciate it. It doesn't help that the script could of been written better, and maybe a different director and producer. The intense action though made up for that. I smell a remake in the future with a souped up script and a better director.",Gamer
244,ongbakfan-914-120298,Awesome to the core. :),10,4 December 2010,"GAMER is an amazing story that shows chicks, violence, awesome technology, and yet kept it on a low budget. I don't understand why critics hated this movie. I didn't see nothing wrong with the film. What was really amazing is the continuity or goofs are very little in this movie. Gamer teams up with the directors of Crank and Crank 2 and Gerard Butler also with Terry Crews and Amber Valletta. Lionsgate has done it again. Although GAMER is not as cool and insane as Crank 2 but still awesome to the core. I do recommend those who loves games, violence, and for the ladies, Gerard Butler. I give this 10 out of 10. :)",Gamer
245,timm27,"Okay story, gruesome portrayal",3,8 March 2011,"Well, this has been the longest 90 minute movie I've ever watched. I kept looking at the time, justifying that if I would just stop now, I wouldn't have wasted too much on it.First off, I'll give it a bit of credit for the premise. From an objective standpoint it's fairly interesting (story spoiler): nanotechnological cells replace the actual brain cells, allowing the brain to be controlled by other people. (A similar technology as in Surrogates, except in Gamer the people aren't prettified avatars of real people, but volunteers/death-row inmates that let others control them.) Then, add the guy that designed the whole system and is playing his own game into the mix, and you have a story. Sort of. I guess.Those between, say, 18 to 30, you might find the tech premise behind the movie interesting, regardless of its depiction. The premise isn't horribly done, it's just. . .horrible. (I'm 19 and was able to identify with a lot of the 'gaming ambiance' in this movie. It's something this generation was brought up with and the movie does an okay job of making it futuristic.)Most astonishingly, I think this has been the most ethically, morally, humanly disgusting movie I have ever seen. I don't know how else to put it. Another reviewer described it as being written by a horny 13 year old. In my opinion, that 13 year old must also have been a sadist paired with who knows what other psychological problems. (Or moviegoers in general love senseless gore and womanizing. I'm not sure there's really a line anymore.) This is why I voted it a 3. The tech aspect is almost the only reason to sit through this movie, and that's challenged by how hard it is to continue watching it at all.If it's any consolation, the story ends on an okay note with respect to the dignity of humankind.But I still don't think it's worth anyone's 90 minutes.(Not even to watch Logan Lerman, which was how I found the movie and sort of the main reason I decided to watch it. This has been a reminder that good actors doesn't always mean good movies.)",Gamer
246,andrew_ilovedirt,Within the top 10 worst movies I've ever seen,3,27 August 2020,"I have never written a review before. If a movie is bad, I just leave it, but Gamer is so unbelievably terrible I had to warn others. I feel like I am less of a person now that I've seen it. Like the sky isn't so blue and I have lost a part of myself..
I don't know how, but I'm certain a pair of 13 year old boys got a budget and swindled a studio to make this movie. Unless you are a 13 year old, you will not like this movie. It does not have a single redeeming quality.",Gamer
247,mrandrewv-40-234580,An under-appreciated and stylish critique of online culture,8,13 November 2012,"It troubles me that so few people appreciated 'Gamer'.It certainly had its flaws. The final sequence was a tad cheesy and Michael C. Hall was not up to his usual fine standard.But the film is stylish as hell and contains a potent critique of gaming and online culture.When we see the 'players' behaving atrociously to the convicts it's because this is precisely the kind of attitude towards violence that gaming culture provokes in some of its members.When we see a morbidly obese, sweaty man adopt the role of a svelte blond woman it has been done because this is the reality of online personas: you never know who you're sabering with, even though you might pretend that you do.I think the reason why this film wasn't as popular as it should have been is because non-gamers don't get it and gamers are offended by how accurately it critiques us. The use of the derogatory term ""cumdumpster"", the appearance of ""tea bagging"" the construction of the MMO ""society""; all of these things have been inserted by someone who knows gaming culture inside and out and isn't afraid to point out the flaws in our way of life.And I say ""our"" intentionally. I've been an avid gamer since 1988. I've seen the highs ('Starcontrol 2', 'Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory', 'Bioshock', 'Portal') and the lows ('Resident Evil 4 for PC', 'GTA', 'Postal', 'Call of Duty: Black Ops', 'Just Cause' (anything that takes its name from an imperialist invasion is worthy of nothing but contempt)).I love gaming, and always will, but that doesn't mean the culture, and its impact on the world, isn't worthy of critique.As of the time of writing nothing has done as good of job of critiquing gamer culture from the inside, as this movie.Except perhaps 'Spec Ops: The Line'.",Gamer
248,dominicfrench42,"Death Race 3? (lots of spoilers, pretty much the entire plot)",3,7 May 2012,"anyone else noticed that this film was just a tad similar to death race? both set in the near future where prisons are filling up to fast and the solution. kill the criminals that committed the worst crimes. yet there is one guy in both films who has been framed and didn't actually commit the crime, similar enough? NNNOOOO, of course not there is more, hero has to win x amount of games to escape and is close to the target, in addition the said ""criminal"" has to get to his young daughter but knows that he wont actually be set free when he reaches his target so has to escape and then kill the bad guy who put them there in the first place. kills bad guy and lives happily ever after. now don't get me wrong i didn't completely hate this film, for instance the fat guy playing a chick and talking to other guys made me laugh but honestly, i sat through death race, was mildly entertained.i sat through gamer and thought, touch of deja-vu right there. if Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor were not watching death race while writing this then i am mickey mouse's twin sister ""bullshit mouse"". rant over :)",Gamer
249,Kid_Kincaid,It's Crank. With steroids.,7,2 September 2009,"Just came back from a preview. This movie starts right in the middle of the action. Heavy thunderous music, loud and manic mayhem. The premise is good in my opinion. Real humans control other humans, but with a twist - I won't go into details :o)If you've seen the Crank films, you'll immediately notice the style of the directors. Every action frame fast paced, quickly edited, the use of music and all kinds of sounds add to the total viewing experience.I finally got a chance to see Mr. Butler use some serious fighting skills. The way he molests the badguys make you wanne clap your hands in pure joy. The guy just looks really fit !At the end of the movie, a thought came to mind : when playing online games, who hides behind the characters ? Enjoy the flick :o)",Gamer
250,viobane,I liked this movie better when it was The Running Man,3,22 January 2010,"Why the makers of this movie decided to make a twitch trigger happy movie that seemed like a technological upgrade to Schwarzenegger's sci-fi game show.It's not that this practice in Hollywood is not common nowadays. Take a concept from an older movie and either ""update it"" or take themes from it and make a movie that seems different in some way.""Gamer"" fails where ""Running Man"" succeeded in part because the game behind the ""Running Man"" made sense and seemed watchable. The games within the movie take a few extreme concepts from real online gaming and make the reality of the movie fit these extreme clichés.The souped up version of ""The Sims,"" a horribly obese and disgusting man playing a beautiful woman in that game, a FPS sort of main game being played by ""Slayers"" which pits these players against some sort of randomly violent survival arenas. I am sure there could be a drinking game based on spotting the clichés.I think until movie makers take some effort to understand that not all gamers are 13 year old idiots and perverts, you're going to continue to get crap like this.Oh, and don't forget the horribly embarrassing musical number toward the end. I'd take 1000 Arnie puns to that atrocity.The only reason I give this movie a few points is that the camera work is rather interesting, and it did make me want to watch ""Running Man"" again.",Gamer
251,jusstjuss,Great Visual Representation of What it is Like to Be a Gamer,9,2 April 2016,"The world of gaming has been growing for years and years, and will continue to grow as long as new and exciting games are being produced. The film Gamer (2009) represents one possible outcome for the gaming community in the not-so-distant future using a beautiful combination of several unique characteristics: presentation being key. It is common knowledge that when the year 2000 came around, widespread panic ensued because it was thought technology would begin destroying the planet in some horrible fashion only SkyTech would be able to commence- a ridiculous notion to those alive today. Gamer not only elaborates on the fear of technology, it also presents several reasons for technology to be feared. The film is shot in a sporadic way, offering scenes of nothing but plot twists and action, which is very similar to how video games are presented. In a video game, the characters get right to the point of what they're saying, and the plot builds from hardly any background information at all, just like this film. The motion capture in a game is also very rough and meant to really place you at the scene, and the filmography also attempts at presenting this connection. The film Gamer wasn't an outstanding movie, but it was, however, a wonderful presentation of the gaming community and a great way to express what it is like to be a gamer to the non-gaming personnel.",Gamer
252,jon_mhz,It was just wrong,2,20 September 2009,"Firstly, I applaud the idea of the film. It does truly depict a futuristic earth where gaming takes over another dimension. Looking at today's gaming society where people are engrossed in games such as World of Warcraft and online FPS games such as counter-strike, unreal or call of duty, its really not that hard to imagine the world as depicted by the movie. It also does show the side of human nature where we lust for sex and violence.However, to me it was like Leonardo da Vinci's blue prints for a flying machine. At first glance it seems beautiful and ingenious, yet it suffers from fundamental flaws and as such the end result does not work. The movie in my opinion was started as a good idea but it was channeled across very badly, from acting to plot, and thus making it a very bad movie.I urge those who are deciding if to watch this movie or not, I say stay away.Of course there are some of you who have already watch and thought that this film was otherwise I urge you to watch perhaps ""Death Race"" or the Japanese movie ""Battle Royale"" (The manga/comic is so much better)as those movies are dealing with near similar topics and it was done much better.",Gamer
253,suecat-1,More blatant XXX than plot,5,7 June 2013,"If you like watching a huge fat man getting off via virtual reality, then this is a movie for you. If you want to see lots of bare breasts, mostly exposed derrières, and hot actors, then this is a movie for you.If however, you want a movie with a plot, developed characters, and some decent acting, then you many want to pass on this one.Lots of sex- and violence-related scenes, way too many holes in how the premise of the movie actually works, aka...plenty of time to raid the fridge.I love Gerard Butler, but this is beneath his abilities. I've seen him in a half dozen other films and he shined. Here, you spend half the movie trying to figure out why he would ever have agreed to filming this movie. Maybe just a run at more money, or maybe he didn't know the reality of the direction of this film.It is a violent shoot'em up kind of flick and I did watch it to the end. I'd never spend my time watching it again, though. Nuff said.",Gamer
