0,bkoganbing,Entrusted with the memories of the past,8,12 January 2015,"If you think that the world that George Orwell created in 1984 was a rigid one they were positively hedonistic compared to the society shown in The Giver. Playing the title role is Jeff Bridges who is called that because he has a very special duty to be the one entrusted with the memories of the past. The ruling body of the society has to be able to refer to the past to be guided in making decisions. But we can't have everyone knowing about lest they long for the good things of the past. It's all been abolished the good and the bad, conformity and sameness is the order of things. Color is not even allowed everyone wears drab clothing like they were in prison. The family is abolished, kids are born and then assigned to nurturers, women particularly go into that occupation and it is an occupation like being a plumber. A new group of young people are being given new assignments and young Brendon Thwaites sits eagerly awaiting his occupation. He gets the prize as he is chosen to be the Receiver of all the past knowledge from Bridges. His training is to telepathically connect with Bridges all the experiences of the past, the good and the bad.The use of color in film is never thought of this day, it's simply assumed that films now will be photographed that way. But The Giver takes its place along side Schindler's List and Pleasantville in using color sparingly and to make a point. Color comes into Thwaites world as it has been in Bridges' and the equation of knowledge with color is a point well made.When Thwaites decides that there's something more out there than what he's grown up with, society shakes. None other than chief elder Meryl Streep wants measures to be taken to stop Thwaites from questioning the order of things. Thwaits, Streep, and Bridges head a cast that tells a thought provoking tale of curiosity and rebellion and curiosity in seeking something better always proceeds rebellion. The film ends abruptly and I suspect there's some box office soundings being taken to see if a sequel is to be made. I hope one is, but if it's not The Giver can certainly stand on its own.",The Giver
1,SnoopyStyle,promising but doesn't completely deliver,6,21 May 2015,"After the Ruin, the Community was build as an utopia where everybody is the same, emotions are suppressed and memories of the past are restricted. When Jonas turns 18, he's selected to be the community's Receiver of Memories. His best friends Fiona and Asher also turn 18. He goes to train with The Giver (Jeff Bridges) to learn the memories of the past. Meryl Streep plays the Chief Elder. Katie Holmes and Alexander Skarsgård play Jonas' parents. The previous Receiver Rosemary (Taylor Swift) 10 years ago came to a tragic end.The idea of colors and memories are interesting. I especially like the idea of memories which reminds me a little of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. This is not nearly as artistic or compelling. There is just enough that one gets a small taste of something much better and what this could have been.I also have questions about this world. This world feels incomplete like the author explained it in a paragraph and the reader fills in the gap. The movie just hasn't filled those gaps with enough precision. I do have to praise this franchise. It seems to be a little bit more ambitious than the others but I wouldn't say it's complete. Also it fails as a movie to be intense. The climax is there but without much excitement. The final scene is really just asking for a sequel which is probably not coming.The acting is functional. Most of them are required to be distant and controlled. Jeff Bridges, Odeya Rush and Brenton Thwaites are the only ones required to act out emotions. Meryl Streep may actually be acting too much. I have to say that I like Katie Holmes acting removed which kind of fits her. Thwaites is asked to calibrate his acting and he does a reasonable job. Rush is pretty effective and quite touching. Jeff Bridges is doing basically the same note.",The Giver
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Occasional weaknesses, but all in all a good movie",6,12 October 2015,"""The Giver"" is an American movie that was released roughly a year ago. It takes place in a parallel universe in a world where emotions have vanished. The goal of the world's leaders was to get rid of the negative emotions and occurrences resulting from them (such as war). Unfortunately, they lost the positive emotions as well on the way to achieving their goal. So you will not be very surprised I guess to hear that this film is about bringing these emotions back. The cast is really good, includes Meryl Streep, Jeff Bridges and a couple young talented actors, such as Brenton Thwaites, who plays the central character. The director is Phillip Noyce, a pretty experienced filmmaker from Australia. I don't think I have seen any of his other works though.Let me start with the positive: The world created here is pretty memorable and there is certainly some smart writing included in these slightly under 90 minutes (without credits). Some good love to detail and interesting aspects where I thought that maybe it is not completely different to the world we live in. Unfortunately, there are also weaknesses. First of all, I found the difference they made with black-and-white versus color fairly uninspired. It has been done so many times already and it did not feel particularly smart to me. And as convincingly as the world was written, I cannot say the same about the characters. Some of them are really stereotypical and by the books and none of their actions ever surprised me I must say. A great thumbs-up to Jeff Bridges, who was certainly the MVP here and elevated the material a lot. I wish I could say the same about Streep, who gave a good performance and the makeup fits her nicely as well, but her character is just so uninteresting that I'd almost call her one of the least memorable 2014 film villains I've seen. And finally, why would her character choose his friend to go and stop him? A complete rookie for such an important mission? The only reason I can come up with and that would work in the film's favor is that she acted as she had to in her position, but in reality wanted him not to be stopped on his mission. Still, I felt the friendship with Asher played such an important role near the end and certainly may have needed better elaboration early on.All in all, I think it is a good movie with some really interesting scenes. On a little side note, I am fairly certain we will see a lot more from Odeya Rush in the future. She has the talent and looks for a great career. Even if true greatness was missing, The Giver is a clever modern take on Orwell's 1984 and I recommend it.",The Giver
3,Prismark10,Number six,5,16 October 2016,"The Giver is an adaptation of a well known Young Adult novel which Jeff Bridges wanted to being top the screen for some years. He produces and stars in the film version.It is a Dystopian film set in some post apocalyptic Orwellian future where life is lived in some monochrome year zero where people are drugged up, lived in assigned family units and occupations where language and behaviour are tightly controlled.In a ceremony presided by the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep) Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) is selected as the Receiver of Memory from the Giver (Jeff Bridges.) Over a period of time he will receive memories, feelings, visions ranging from art, music emotions, colour, war and violence. He will see how society once lived and as the film goes on it is imbued with a wider colour palette. In order to obtain the recollections of the amnesic populace, Jonas must glean the knowledge from the previous vessel, the Giver (Jeff Bridges).The Chief Elder suspects Jonas may not use these memories wisely and wish to go beyond the town's borders. This is a society that makes the elderly and people who do not develop as expected such as a baby introduced to Jonas's family unit to disappear.The Giver rather reminded of similarly themed films such as Divergent and The Hunger Games. However the best comparison to me is The Village by M Night Shyamalan a society that flees backwards to some kind of golden age in the past to avoid the violence of the present and also wishes to keep its inhabitants within some boundaries.It is a straightforward film that tells its story simply but with added visual flourishes and at least it makes you think of the subject matter.",The Giver
4,claudio_carvalho,Interesting Premise,6,18 July 2015,"After The Ruin, a colorless equalitarian society is formed without memories and everyone follows rules established by the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep) and the Elders. The population uses drugs to stay happy and on the day of the graduation, the teenagers leave their childhood and are assigned to a career chosen by the Elders. Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) lives with his parents and has two best friends, Fiona (Odeya Rush) and Asher (Cameron Monaghan), and he feels different from his friends. He is assigned to be the Receiver of Memories and he is trained by his mentor, The Giver (Jeff Bridges), who gives memories of the world before The Ruin. Jonas learns emotions such as love and fear and the concept of family. When he discovers that the baby Gabriel that he loves as a brother will be eliminated, he decides to change his society but the Chief Elder will do anything to stop him.""The Giver"" is a film with a story with and interesting premise about a ""perfect emotionless society"". The execution seems to be a combination of the black and white of ""Pleasantville"", ""Brave New World"" and the lack of emotions through the use of drugs of ""Equilibrium"" for teens. The result is a reasonable and forgettable movie, with poor development of the characters and situation. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Doador de Memórias"" (""The Memories's Donator"")",The Giver
5,nogodnomasters,BRAVE NEW DIVERGENT WORLD,8,18 December 2018,"Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) lives in an isolated futuristic utopian society complete with genetic engineering, void of emotion, and people control through daily chemical injections. It is an artificial society that appears to be black and white. When the students graduate (Hint at target audience) they are assigned professions based on their observed talents. Jonas was special and is to receive special training from ""The Giver"" (Jeff Bridges who never says ""man"" or ""dude""). Jonas is to learn pain, emotion, and be given memories of the past world and life, the good, the bad, and the ugly.Following the formula, Jonas believes this clean utopian society is worse than the world we lived in and sets out to change things.This is another teen saves the world film. Fans of Divergent, Hunger Games, etc. should find interest in this picture. The film spent a lot of time in the beginning setting up the world and getting Jonas into training. The end felt hurried and I suspect dragged out longer in the book. With fifteen minutes left, I was thinking it should have another thirty to forty minutes to go.Yes this is another deep profound utopian society film that asks the same questions as all the other deep profound utopian society films.I felt it was overrated at PG-13. No swearing, sex, or nudity. Infant is given an injection to kill it. Boy punched in face. Flashes of war scenes.",The Giver
6,kosmasp,Giving gift,7,12 April 2015,"Another one of those movies about misunderstood teens or rather a society that tries to oppress them. But it's more than a decent stab at the whole thing, especially with such acting talents as Streep and Bridges at the ""helm"". The main role though is played by someone else. Apparently the character was only 12 in the original book, but they went with an older version. Though the 20-something actor is still supposed to be a teen (as in many similar cases).The story is pretty nice and decent and flows along nicely. If you did like ""Hunger Games"" and Teenage movies along that same line you will love this too. I am a bit biased since I really do like the actors that I mentioned above. The movie itself has some clichés, but I think it overall does a good job of telling a story",The Giver
7,lee_eisenberg,So is this movie trying to be anti-totalitarian or just plain libertarian?,3,21 December 2014,"Lois Lowry's book ""The Giver"" was part of the class's reading material when I was in fifth grade. I loosely understood that it was about a boy in an idealistic society who learns that there's an unpleasant world outside of his society. I got interested when I learned that a movie was getting made out of the book, but the news that Walden Media - the brainchild of religious fanatic Philip Anschutz - was producing it, that turned me off, since Walden Media's most famous product was the mendacious ""Waiting for Superman"".Now that I've seen the movie, I'm trying to figure out whether the movie is an indictment of any society or civilization that's built on a mountain of lies, or if it's a libertarian screed (with the individual standing up to the governmental overreach). Seriously, I can't tell which it's supposed to be. Whichever it is, the movie didn't impress me. Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep should both know better than to degrade themselves like this. If you want a good movie from Phillip Noyce, stick to ""The Quiet American"" and ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"".",The Giver
8,edwagreen,Better Not to Receive than to be A Giver *,1,9 August 2015,"Absolutely dreadful film with Meryl Streep still thinking that she is the devil wearing Pravda once again.The film deals with a Utopian like society which is anything but perfect. Streep as the tribe elder is quite wicked here and will do anything in her power to stop freedom of thought.In this society practically everything is done for you and after graduation, it is determined what you shall be in life.Jonas is to be the receiver of the past life and Jeff Bridges portrays his mentor, the current receiver who looks like Abe Lincoln would have looked like in old age had he not been assassinated.The Bridges character has other things on his mind as he thinks back to the daughter he lost 10 years before due to the very unhealthy climate.Why did Streep want to kill that beautiful baby? Why would anyone make a film as miserable as this?",The Giver
9,LeonLouisRicci,OK If You Were Born Yesterday or the Day Before,6,28 February 2015,"Interesting to a Point and to those Young or Sheltered that are Unaware of the Literary Works of Ray Bradbury or George Orwell, and the Films, well, too many to mention but a Dozen or more are Out There if You Care. Safe as it may be to Present such a Dystopian Message to Youngsters in sort of an Unedgy, Innocuous, and Simplistic Surrounding (Black & White = Soulless) and Populate it with Zombified Pedestrians and slowly Awakening, something Isn't quite Right, Tweens, the Movie has to be more Intense or more of, just More of Everything.The Movie is too Short, too Derivative, too Bland, too Shallow, too Lacking in anything that could Propel such an Important Message for the Coming of Agers to Relate. It's an OK Film for the Uninformed and Seekers of Truth in Elementary Education and Naive Middle-Schoolers. With its Lack of Intensity and hands off Sexuality it is likely to be of Interest to Religious Fundamentalists and as it does have some Religiosity In some Corny Heavy Doses at times. The Tune behind the cabin door is Seasonal.But Overall, it's just too Familiar to be anything to Get Excited About Unless You Want another Confirmation that Individuality and Ego are things to be Watched very Carefully, because if ""Given a choice, Humans are weak and will make the wrong one"". Was that an Echo?",The Giver
10,neil-476,Yet another YA dystopian sci-fi offering,7,26 September 2014,"Following some unspecified cataclysmic event, people live in a utopian settlement, stripped by rules and medication of emotion, curiosity, initiative and memories. Group memory resides in The Giver and his young apprentice Jonas. But the memories he is given affect Jonas and, when he starts skipping his daily medication, he begins to get ideas.Where to begin? Well, let's start with the negatives. This dystopian sci-fi Young Adult offering starts with yet another Sorting Hat sequence (see also Divergent) and shades of Logan's Run. There are some fairly massive plot points which, at best, needed more explanation and, at worst, make no sense at all. The youngsters in the cast are OK but no better. Meryl Streep in a white Cher wig adds some gravitas but strays perilously close to pantomime villainy. And Jeff Bridges plays The Giver in the manner of someone doing a bad Jeff Bridges impersonation.But it's not all bad. The location, sets, and effects all marry together beautifully and are very effective, and there are some very impressive touches in the direction. Also, the story comes to a conclusion: this is not (or, at least, it doesn't have to be) the first part of a trilogy.I left this with a sense of unfulfilled potential - there was so much here which could - and should - have been much better than it was.",The Giver
11,Uriah43,Life in Black-and-White,5,6 July 2016,"The story for this film takes place in the future after some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe has occurred which has resulted in several villages separating themselves from the rest of the world and abiding by certain rules and customs to achieve harmony and further isolating themselves. One particular rule involves everybody taking a daily injection of a drug which prevents emotions and consequently makes the people more willing to follow the orders of the counsel elders who determine just about everything. There are no sick people and those too old or unable to adapt are sent to a place called ""elsewhere"". Nobody cares. Likewise, almost nobody has a sense of history and ignorance of anything outside the village is universal. Again, nobody really cares-except for one person who realizes the emptiness of their situation and wants to bring life back to the village. His calls himself ""the Giver"" (Jeff Bridges) and he hopes that his new replacement named ""Jonas"" (Brenton Thwaites) can assimilate enough of his knowledge to help him in achieving a new reality. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film definitely had potential. The acting was decent and the film remained interesting from start to finish. Unfortunately, there were definitely some weak spots here and there and they became more noticeable as the story progressed which eventually resulted in an ending that was simply too far-fetched and unbelievable. But all things considered it wasn't a bad movie overall and young audiences will probably love it. In any case, I have rated the movie accordingly. Average.",The Giver
12,anaconda-40658,Odeya Gives.,7,1 September 2015,"The Giver (2014): Dir: Phillip Noyce / Cast: Brenton Thwaites, Jeff Bridges, Odeya Rush, Meryl Streep, Katie Holmes: Set in the very distant future blanketed in a black and white atmosphere thus eliminating feeling, emotion, race, and basically, conflict. It is a film about connection and experience. In a curious setup that may remind some viewers of Divergent, everyone is split into particular groupings depending on stature and ability. Jeff Bridges plays the Giver, the key holder of the world's past, memories and emotions. He lives at the edge of this isolated community surrounded by books. Brenton Thwaites plays Jonas, who has been assigned to be the next Giver. The elder Bridges grasps his hands and shows him a past earth full of love, fear, hate, envy, and desire. He discovers what love is and desires to share it with Fiona, a friend since childhood. This causes tension when the chief elder learns that the Giver is training Jonas to travel to the outer limits thus breaking their controlled society. Provocative themes throughout with ideas and visual wonders that may leave viewers wanting more by its lingering conclusion. Director Phillip Noyce presents a lavish of black and white spectacular with occasional colours emerging. Thwaites is decent casting as Jonas. Bridges as the Giver is given background regarding his daughter, a previous pupil. Odeya Rush plays the fresh face Fiona full of life. Meryl Streep is underwhelming deadpan as the chief elder. Katie Holmes is subdued and terrible dialogue as Jonas's mother. While often corny, the film presents a perfect society that is not so perfect when the seemingly balanced is hardly a given. Score: 7 ½ / 10",The Giver
13,phd_travel,The message is dated,5,21 August 2014,"The problem with this movie is that given that right now the world has so much war and disease, ""The Elsewhere"" isn't better than what's inside overall . So the whole premise that breaking out may not be such a good idea! The whole story is a bit nothing. Not having some get together at the end was an anti climax. That's the problem when a 90s book is made into a movie 20 years later.Brenton Thwaites and Odeya Rush are the cute leads although she isn't that distinctive looking. The ending wasn't romantic since they didn't meet up again. Jeff Bridges sounded like Santa mumbling ho ho ho. Meryl's hair didn't suit her. Looked a bit like Angelica Huston. Katie Holmes had a sad expression on her face.The production is quite good with an attractive society and some nice landscapes on the way out. This movie is for fans of the book who want to see it on screen. Not a must see otherwise.",The Giver
14,Mr-Fusion,The film's delay probably cost it its narrative punch,6,13 February 2015,"""The Giver""'s journey to the big screen is a story unto itself, which is why my curiosity's been piqued for a while. I haven't read the book and I tend to wonder what's been changed to make this fit in with the recent YA trend in movies (""The Hunger Games"", etc), as there's a distinct been-there-done-that feeling to this movie (the stopping of the injections is right out of ""Equilibrium""). But it's got a perfectly chosen Jeff Bridges, the appropriately severe Meryl Streep, and a youthful cast that ranges from suitably bland to . . . Taylor Swift (Christ, she's in movies now). It did feel a bit silly towards the end with society's sudden change, but the movie does convey the dangers of sameness and the indisputable need for emotion as a people.And I am interested in Lois Lowry's book, which I guess is the film's ultimate purpose. 6/10",The Giver
15,siderite,Yet another young adult film,7,25 December 2014,"I have not read the book and certainly will not after seeing the movie. Basically it felt like a mash up of several recent films, combining the futuristic and oppressive world where people are not allowed to feel, the rules that are ""for the good of the people"" and where people are being assigned their roles in life, where everything is iPhone white and boring gray and where there are some young adolescent heroes that are willing to change the world. The movie ends with a horrible deus ex machina that makes everything work out fine, despite any reasonable expectation.Now, I rate this film an average because people acted well, the film was reasonably well directed and at no moment in time did I feel like there was any attempt to do anything more than what was on the screen. So the film does not fail as a cinematic endeavor. It does fail personally, for me, as it made me feel nothing except ""oh, this is taken from Divergent! Oh, this is from Equilibrium! Look, they couldn't afford Tom Cruise, so they cast his ex wife"".Bottom line: nice looking and boring, just like the future society the main character fought against. The imagery and emotional content was as heavy handed as a woodsman's axe, the ideas unoriginal, the story uninspiring. Another Apple movie (yes, I know it's red!)",The Giver
16,namashi_1,A Good Effort!,6,16 November 2014,"Based on the 1993 novel of same name by Lois Lowry, 'The Giver' is a well-made film, that has dazzling visuals as well as soul. The only problem in this Social/Sci-Fi film, is its slow-pace, which needed some serious persuasion!'The Giver' Synopsis: In a seemingly perfect community, without war, pain, suffering, differences or choice, a young boy is chosen to learn from an elderly man about the true pain and pleasure of the ""real"" world.'The Giver' makes good use of its interesting premise, by translating it into a good effort cinematically. But, as mentioned before, the slow-paced narrative bores, at least in the first-hour. The story moves on a lazy tone & that definitely puts you off. The second-hour is engrossing & the culmination, also, is very engaging.Michael Mitnick & Robert B. Weide's Adapted Screenplay takes its own time to catch momentum, but once it does, it arrests you with force. Phillip Noyce's Direction is fantastic. He has handled the entire film commendably. Cinematography is excellent. Editing is lazily done. Art Design & Visual Effects are flawless. Performance-Wise: Jeff Bridges as The Giver, is restrained. Brenton Thwaites as Jonas/The Receiver, is earnest. Meryl Streep is masterful, in a negative role. Cameron Monaghan is impressive. Katie Holmes is alright.On the whole, 'The Giver' isn't without its flaws, but it also has enough merit to earn itself a viewing.",The Giver
17,ksf-2,similar to logan's run,6,10 June 2021,"Not a fan of jeff bridges, but the plot sounded intriguing. Right at the beginning of this, we are told the rules of the ""new"" society.

And within the first couple minutes, we learn that not everyone is following the rules. Just minor infractions at first.

18,Hellmant,What was 'lost in translation'?,7,10 December 2014,"'THE GIVER': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Science fiction drama film based on the popular young-adult book, of the same name, by Lois Lowry. It deals with a futuristic Utopian society where an 18-year-old boy is chosen to receive all of society's forgotten past memories. Learning about true pain and suffering, of the real world, makes him realize how fake their forced ideal world really is. The film was written by Michael Mitnick and Robert B. Weide and directed by Phillip Noyce. It stars Brenton Thwaites, Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Odeya Rush, Cameron Monaghan, Alexander Skarsgard, Katie Holmes and Taylor Swift. I found it to be pretty interesting, and moving, but it still misses its mark.The story is set in 2048, after a devastating war. Society is now built completely around sameness; ridding the wold of all of it's differences and people's uniqueness. All citizens have had their memories erased, of everything that happened prior to the Utopia they now live in, except for one man, known as 'The Giver' (Bridges). He advises the 'Chief Elder' (Streep), and all other leaders, on how to govern their community (due to his knowledge of the past). A young boy, named Jonas (Thwaites), is chosen to take over the responsibilities of 'The Giver' and learn all of his memories. This new found knowledge causes a lot of distress in Jonas, as he doesn't believe these memories should be kept secret.I've heard the book is really good and you can see a lot of it's great ideas coming to life here, but it doesn't quite live up to them. It's always interesting, involving and even moving but it doesn't really come to a satisfying conclusion. It's not obvious, completely, what was 'lost in translation' but the movie seems like it could have done a lot more. The acting, writing and directing are all decent but there's still something really lacking here. Not a bad film by any means though; I'd say it's definitely still worth seeing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/zsvb7ypwxL4",The Giver

It skims over most of the novel and adds in clichés we've come to expect in these types of films. Plus, it squanders the acting power of both Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges.

21,secondtake,"It's pretty, and romantic, but it's slow and totally lacks originality and conviction",4,2 September 2014,"The Giver (2014)Pain is good. That's the bottom line. Or love is good. Pain and love are good. There. That's it. Oh, there is the black and white photography which I love, and the bits of color, and then the uber-color. And the music will soar at the right moments (think the ending of ""Soylent Green"") and bring tears to your eyes. If you let it. But the experience is superficial, and the ideas as thin, and as fresh, as parchment. A deadening experience for me, and I almost walked out.So other people love this movie? I mean, love love love this movie? Yes. It's actually a feel good young person's romance. It brims with optimism and storybook romance, and even though couched in a layered world of autocratic cruelty it leaves you knowing you can be free, have emotions, fall in love, and be an individual.But wait—we can already do all that! What this situation gives is so linear, and it tips over with so many clichés, it's amazing it can last an hour and a half. But it does. And it's a simplistic bore.Those of you who have read the book(s), go ahead, give this review a thumbs down. If think this is wisdom and creativity at its best, open up to the future, which will be your reward. I don't blame anyone for letting this stir your young soul into bright eyed wonder. That doesn't make this a good movie. Or put better: this could have been a good, very good movie.Here's what's wrong.1) There are many stories and movies where the future is bleak, and the citizens are being made into submissives. And where one of the masses (usually only one) sees the wrong in this and rises up to overturn the horrors.2) There is only one main story line, which is about this particular individual having a chance to rise up, and he does.3) There is almost no character development. Yes, everyone is meant to be drugged into boredom and sameness, but that's no excuse for letting us into people's nuances— especially the main character (Brenton Thwaites) and the title character (Jeff Bridges).4) The concept is filled with inconsistencies and logical gaffes.5) It's a tiny world, like the size of a college campus, and so where are the factories, the farms, the power generators?6) Why only one ""giver"" and one ""receiver"" and what happens if they die before they are supposed to?7) Everyone's conversations are recorded, and yet no one gets in trouble for breaking the rules until much later, when things have gone awry.7) Murdering babies? Blasé? Whatever.Etc. What's right here? Well, Meryl Streep makes a good matriarch, and she gives the movie its one truly felt portrayal, especially in her last long scene. And the photography is slick and appropriate (though not groundbreaking or remarkable on its own). The buildings are cool, and the waterfall fountain brilliant.C'est la vie.",The Giver

I was very surprised at how much I liked this,7,23 November 2014,"""I know there is something more, something that has been stolen."" It is choosing day and Jonas (Thwaites) is told that he is to be a receiver of memories. He meets The Giver (Bridges) and is amazed at what he shows him.

The Elders are not happy with what is going on and they do all they can to stop Jonas, but he will stop at nothing to make everyone remember. I had no idea what to expect from this movie at all. I never read the book and only caught glimpses of trailers. I expected another teenager-y save the world movie so I sat down with pretty low expectations. I have to say that I was very surprised at how much I liked this. The easiest way to describe this is a combination of Divergent and Pleasantville. When you watch you will see exactly what I mean (as long as you have seen both of those movies). This is a great family movie and my entire family loved it. It is rated PG- 13 and I think it is because of one small part but you will not have to have your hand on the pause or fast forward button if you are watching this with your family. Overall, this is just a good movie that the whole family will enjoy. I give this a B+.",The Giver
23,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,27 November 2014,"The GiverThe upside to a society without feelings is no one gets upset when you cut them off in traffic.However, as this sci-fi film points out, no road rage also means there's no empathy.Raised in a post-apocalyptic world where emotions are outlawed and occupations are assigned, Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) is selected as the Receiver of Memory.In order to obtain the recollections of the amnesic populace, Jonas must glean the knowledge from the previous vessel, the Giver (Jeff Bridges).But the pair's tutorials are scrutinized by The Chief Elder (Meryl Streep), who suspects Jonas may flee their Utopia for the mysteries beyond its boarders.Deriving more inspiration from modern dystopian movies than the YA novel it's based on, The Giver's weighty tale of repression is not entirely lost but a lot less impactful.Furthermore, as the Receiver of Memory you have to recall where everyone left their car keys.

24,851222,"Poor stuff, nonsense story - one of the worst of 2014",3,27 October 2014,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Giver"" (2014) is kinda nicely made movie, you can spend 87 min. watching it. But here is the main question. Why even bother to do it? Why someone was even bother to make this movie at all? The story of ""The Giver"" is the biggest nonsense that i have witness in 2014 so far. What was the point of this whole mess? That life is precious? Wow! That feelings are the most important thing? WOW! This film is so boring, and thats a very bad word to describe a movie. What Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep were even doing in it? They literally sleepwalked through this movie with one face expression. Do we really needed these legends to appear for like ~20 min on screen in total? The story was so lame, i couldn't not one reason to root for someone in this movie. Oh ye, and i features Taylor Swift - your 1989 album is very cool, so you should better stick to music. Overall, a very poor movie, without a single intrigue, you already have saw this stuff in many way better movies. Huge nonsense and very lame story with some wooden acting from two movie legends makes ""The Giver"" sadly on the worst movies of 2014.",The Giver
25,tabuno,A Solid Sci Fi Young Adult Movie,9,13 January 2019,"16 June 2016. The Giver offers up a simple but focused and thrilling sci fi experience including two A-Listed Actors: Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep. The script appears to take elements from the vicarious you are there experience of Natalie Wood's Brainstorm (1983) sci fi thriller, the black and white motif of the fantasy comedy of Jeff Daniel's Pleasantville (1998), and the out of place youth in the more recent sci fi move of George Clooney's Tomorrowland (2015). The Giver also include concepts from Charlize Theron's sci fi thriller Aeon Flux (2005) of seemingly contented world with a dark underbelly or the different boy in a seemingly rational futuristic world in Harrison Ford's sci fi action adventure Ender's Game (2013).What's unusual about The Giver is that the plot is concentrated on a boy who is offered to become a special person in a world where nobody is supposed to special. The really doesn't depend overly on exciting action so much as the more fascinating mental challenge of opposing cultural norms and experiencing an entirely different worldview. The movie's theme is consistently on display and the emotional ties in this more of less uplifting movie is pleasant and thrilling on the senses. An enjoyable, worthwhile movie about the willingness to go beyond and believe in something more.",The Giver
26,ironhorse_iv,"The Giver gives a watchable movie, but could had done better for itself.",7,19 September 2014,"The Giver is one of those movies, that you have to fight really hard to suspense your disbelief, because it's so far into the Sci-Fiction spectacle that it's really hard to believe a society like this could honestly could exist. Directed by Phillip Noyce, the movie is based on the 1993 American children's novel by Lois Lowry of the same name. The movie is set in a utopian society, where society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to ""Sameness,"" a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives. A young man Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) is selected to inherit the position of Receiver of Memory from the Giver (Jeff Bridges), the person who stores all the past memories of the time before Sameness, in case they are ever needed to aid in decisions that others lack the experience to make. While, learning about the emotional world; Jonas uncovers the hidden truth about his utopia community and fight back their control by trying to set the world: free of emotional control. For a novel that won the 1994 Newbery Medal, and was very challenging book. The movie somewhat lost a bit of that in depth social commentary between translation from book to screen. The movie, while dealing with in depth social themes, also felt a bit sloppy, preachy and cheesy in its writing. Characters throughout the film, seem to portray more emotional elements than the book is supposed allow them to be. Even, for a society that has no clue, what war, sadness, pain, love, and death is. They seem to know a lot more, than what they're supposed to know. I doubt, they honestly need a Giver. He would seem more like a threat, than a help. It makes no sense why his character was there. The film really try hard to give the feel of 'Sameness' but it's clearly lacking of it, in a story telling element. Even, if it was possible to eradicated emotional depth, the way, its present on film, is clearly impossible to show in an entertaining matter, without people getting tired of boredom. The whole movie concept could be boring. Sadly, the movie couldn't darn do that, so they change dialogue & settlings to make the people seem more like humans than mindless zombies. Even with those changes, the movie can still seem boring to a broader audience, who hasn't read the book and dealt with its themes. The movie update the story, changing the main protagonist age from 13 to now 18 years old of age, just to capitalize on the dystopia Young Adult novel phrase that movies like 2012s Hunger Games help made popular. In my opinion, the movie should had gone the Stanley Kubrick route of filmmaking like 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey than try to gimmick themselves to appeal to young audience. The movie is full of tiresome clichés. I would have to give the movie props for diving in, the book's darker themes with the PG-13 hanging around. You really get the scope of how the Community has lost its way and must have its memories returned. The fault of the book and the film is clearly, how to give the memories back to the Community with the escape of Elsewhere (an unknown land that exists beyond the boundaries of the Communities). You would think that, in Elsewhere, the protagonist would find a really clever deus ex machina, but sadly the film ruin the ambiguous ending of the book and it ends without a large punch or twist. Clearly, they wanted a happier ending, which was disappointing. The novel can even be seen as an allegory for this process of maturation, but the young actors use for the film, lacks the development for that. In no way, does Asher (Cameron Monaghan) given any thought of character development. When it does come, it seem so out of the blue. It's crazy! For the most part, the young actors used here were below average, but reasonable, but I couldn't get behind their acting, too much as half of the time with their awful dialogue, and cheesy movements. Better younger actors would made this movie, better. Minor characters like Jonas's mother & father (Alexander Skarsgård & Katie Holmes) were just alright with their roles. Even, singer Taylor Swift in an unrecognizable role as Rosemary was mediocre, at best. I have to give props to seasons actors like Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep whom gave the movie, some depth that was clearly missing from the younger actors. The movie tries hard to show the Importance of Memory, and the pro & cons conflict of feeling and not feeling with these two and I think it does work. Still, the movie lacks the themes of Nakedness where it related to innocence and childishness and the River, which represent few events that the community cannot predict or control, and Jonas and the Giver are inspired to try to change the community by the idea of the river's unpredictable behavior. I love the theme of the Color red and the Sled, remind me of Orson Welles 1941's Citizen Kane so much. The movie did had a good production value and great cinematography. Love all the wide shots of the landscapes. The music score is forgettable. I don't know, yet if the other sequels books set in the same future era: Gathering Blue (2000), Messenger (2004), and Son (2012) would get movies, but it would interesting if they do. Overall: The concept of the book itself is by far the best part. It brings up the concept of a world without emotions and its possible outcome. The film, however, was poorly executed. It simply did not provide the foreground to provide the viewer with the emotions that they tried to portray.",The Giver
27,zkonedog,Don't Judge It Because It Wasn't The First,8,2 March 2017,"Many years ago, I remember reading ""The Giver"" as a child and being enthralled by it. I didn't really understand it at the time, but I knew even then that it was something special. When I stepped into the theater for this film adaptation of Lois Lowry's now-classic, I was nervous that it wouldn't produce that same type of feeling. I had heard many bad reviews and was a bit worried at the short runtime. What I quickly discovered, however, is that watching ""The Giver"" on the big screen was just as captivating as the novel experience.For a basic plot summary, ""The Giver"" tells the story of teenaged Jonas (Brenton Thwaites), who lives in a dystopian/utopian (you be the judge) society in the distant (but maybe not TOO distant) future. All emotion has been drained out of life and things are very procedural. Babies are assigned to families, rules govern practically every action, there is no crime, and no colors exist. While nearing the end of his formal schooling, Jonas (and his fellow classmates) are assigned functions in everyday society. While most of his friends are assigned to normal tasks associated with everyday life, Jonas is designated the ""receiver of memory"" and must meet with The Giver (Jeff Bridges), who shows him visions of the past and explains the reasoning behind why the current society is how it is. To say any more would tread into spoiler territory.For some reason, I think that this movie may be judged a bit harshly because of all that has come before it. Recently, theaters have been filled with movies such as ""Hunger Games"", ""Divergent"", and ""The Book Thief"" (to name a few) that are based on popular YA novels. Maybe people are starting to get weary of that genre just a bit. However, one must remember that without Lowry's Giver, you could make a case that those other titles would be figments of our imagination and nothing more. So please, don't judge it because for whatever reason it was ""late to the party"".Personally, I think that ""The Giver"" tells an even better story than any of those aforementioned titles. It is filled with great imagery, emotional story lines, and characters that really seem to be alive and are people that you want to care about. Part of the reason is that it isn't just a ""young adult"" story. It can very much appeal to adults and director Phillip Noyce makes sure that his adaptation stays true to that. There aren't sappy love triangles or teenage angst in this one.Overall, this was a treat to see. I have long held the text version in high regard, and I am encouraging anyone who has read that novel to treat themselves to this visual version. Even the controversial scenes are done in such a tactful, thoughtful way that it never seems pandering or ""preachy"".",The Giver
28,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,5,7 August 2015,"Jonas is selected to become the person who will hold the memories of the past, in a world where emotions and lies are forbidden. So, the idea behind the movie is good, and I guess that's because it is a book. However, I haven't read it, so I can't say if the movie makes justice of it. All I can say is that I liked the movie. There was something clean about it, maybe because it wasn't overloaded like some movie adoptions usually are. I loved the colors and the gray shots, that even though the scenery wasn't anything special, it made it magical. I didn't like the ending, and the long walk, and maybe the overplay of the power game. So 5 out of 10.",The Giver
29,leonblackwood,Over the top storyline! 4/10,4,24 January 2015,"Review: I really wasn't feeling this film! I found the storyline long winded and it seemed like a big fuss over nothing. Basically it's about a colony who only see in black and white and live by rules which can never be broken. After all of there young subjects get handed out there lifetime jobs, Jonas gets picked to take on the real memories of the world before the colony ever existed, which leads to extreme changes in Jonas's way of thinking. Once he starts to feel emotions and sees some of the bad and good things that have happened in the world, he decides to escape the colony to free there mind so they can think and feel for themselves. Now you know why I thought the movie was long winded! The lead character, played by Brenton Thwaites, had this annoying lost look on his face throughout the movie and his acting seemed a bit over the top. The storyline went from one extreme to another and I thought the whole escaping the colony with a baby whilst travelling in terrible conditions, was a ridiculous idea by the director. Once everyone starts to see in colour, you don't get to see how the colony adapt to this new way of life because now they can show true emotions and feel like they never did before. Personally I didn't really take to the whole plot but I loved Jeff Bridges character, who was the guy who gave the information of the world's past to Jonas. I was surprised that I didn't hear a big buzz in Hollywood when this movie came out but after watching it, I can understand why. Average!Round-Up: I'm sure that half of the directors in Hollywood would love to have the cast that was in this movie but I can't help but feel that this director really did waste the chance to make something special. Meryl Streep put in her usual brilliant performance as the baddie who wants the colony to stay in order and Jeff Bridges played his part extremely well and I personally think that the movie wouldn't have been half as good without them. The director really over thought the storyline and he didn't think of it from the audiences point of view. A lot of time was wasted on Jonas adapting to the new information from Bridges and the ending just seemed rushed. The escape plan really want thought through properly and I couldn't understand how Meryl Streeps soldiers couldn't find Jonas because he was just riding around the colony on a bike. Anyway, I don't want to carry on picking at the sketchy storyline so I'll just say that it's watchable, basically because you want to find out what happens to Jonas, but it's not that great.Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $67millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their mysterious/sci-fi/drama movies about a teenager who wants to escape his colony after learning about the world's past. 4/10",The Giver
30,howard.schumann,What it truly means to be human,7,19 August 2014,"History tells us that oppression can take many different forms. Author C.S. Lewis said, ""Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive."" In a future world after ""the ruin,"" Philip Noyce's The Giver envisions such a society in which good translates into conformity, where sameness is the most prized attribute, and where the killing of infants is routinely accepted. Based on the 1993 Newbery-winning novel by Lois Lowry and adapted for the screen by Michael Mitnick and Robert B. Weide, in the society that is depicted, all memories have been eradicated including recollections of war or pain.Also nonexistent are distinctions based on color, race, and religion as well as emotions such as joy, fear, and love. Without towns or cities, the residents confront an endless repetition of immaculately landscaped identical dwellings surrounded by clearly marked territorial boundaries that they must not cross. A strict set of rules are severely enforced such as using ""precise"" language, wearing the same assigned clothing, obeying curfews, refraining from telling lies, and taking their daily anti-emotion injections. Oh, yes, questioning authority is also a no-no (sounds like Wall Street except for the not telling lies part).Shot in South Africa in low contrast black and white, the film opens with three friends (all aged from the novel by five years so the script can include a romance) Fiona (Odeya Rush), Asher (Cameron Monaghan), and Jonas (Brenton Thwaites), eagerly looking forward to their graduation ceremony. This is not a graduation with a cap and gown and a diploma, however. Every year young people are assigned a life task by Big Sister, the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep) who is supposed to be Miss Blandness of the year but looks like the next Wicked Witch of the West. The elderly do not fare as well. Having served their purpose, they are banished to ""elsewhere,"" which I guess is just down the road from nowhere, which is where we all live now.In the ceremony, Jonas is given the most prestigious job of all. He will be the Receiver of Memory, a position that has not been filled in ten years since the last Receiver met a whispered-about fate. In his new assignment, the awestruck Jonas will be reporting to a wizened, bearded elderly named The Giver (Jeff Bridges) whose job it is to transmit nothing less than the entire history of the planet. Though Jonas is warned that he will have to endure pain, he is not prepared when The Giver sends him back in time to see a world of vibrant color, the rites of different religions, and images of people dancing and singing as well as the killing of elephants for their ivory and the death of his friends in war.Jonas begins to experience feelings he never knew he had, especially the emotion of love for Fiona and starts to become aware that the society he was raised in is not as perfect as he thought. Realizing that Jonas has the power to change things and restore everyone's memories by crossing a certain boundary, The Giver shows the boy images of underdogs fighting against authority such as the man standing in front of a tank in Tiananmen Square and a picture of Nelson Mandela, though how those images would mean anything to him is not clear. Geared to a teenage audience, The Giver succeeds in conveying the message of what it truly means to be human and the values that are most important in life.Unfortunately, the film's overall effectiveness is limited by one-dimensional characters, a forced love story, banal dialogue, and Hollywood predictability. Unlike films such as The Truman Show, where the viewer only gradually realizes the true nature of the society depicted, Jonas' too sudden understanding of oppression without the slow, burning development of conscience, robs the film of the element of surprise and much of its power.Even with its flaws, however, the film has a lot to say about the dangers of conformity, the suppression of feelings, and the unquestioned acceptance of authority, demonstrating that any attempt to sanitize life is misguided. Poet e.e. cummings put it this way, ""To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battles which any human being can fight, and never stop fighting."" In today's world of overreaching technology and increasing control over our lives, it is a fight that is more important than ever.",The Giver
31,TheMovieDiorama,The Giver is a dystopian sci-fi that just never really gives.,5,24 February 2018,"Another adaptation of a young adult book, and yet another film filled with mediocrity. It's not terrible, it's not good...it's just fine. A ""perfect"" society living in solitude incapable of feeling emotion, until a young boy is chosen to be ""the receiver of memories"". This entails exploring humanity's past to which he then soon realises that he is living in a falsified world. It's an intriguing yet superficial premise which details the glorious aspects of the human world and the harsh reality of war, famine etc. An artificial community created to prevent bloodshed and the capability of an imperfect world. Think of it as 'Equilibrium' meets 'Twilight'. There's a dull young romance, monotonous acting and an expositional script, much like the latter film, but with an inventive premise like the former. The production design felt rather clinical, I appreciated the futuristic architecture and dystopian rituals that were included in this paradise. The generational hierarchy was a clear indication towards the acting. Streep and Bridges gave their best with the material given, Holmes and Skarsgard were second best and then we come to Thwaites and Rush who were monotonous much like the monochromatic colour scheme. The colour gradient was put to good use, slowly incorporating pigments as our main character is introduced to memories. Taylor Swift is in it for ten seconds, no idea why. Heck, I didn't even recognise her at first. The script was just bad, filled with exposition and no character development at all. The editing was far too frantic with a concoction of quick cuts. Also the ending...what even was that? Is that really a conclusion? Really? It literally makes no sense. So despite the non-sensical finale, mediocre acting and dull script...it's not all bad. Just wasted potential I guess, but I'm used to that with these young adult adaptations. Might be the first film to use both ""giver"" and ""receiver""...giggity...",The Giver
32,BeneCumb,Trivial story insufficiently considered,6,12 January 2015,"I have not read the book, but a lot in this movie reminded of other related movies released in recent years, particularly Divergent. True, performances are better, thanks mainly to the ""old guard"" - Academy Award winners Jeff Bridges as The Giver and Meryl Streep as The Chief Elder; the young ones are just based on cute looks - but the topics and values depicted seemed often half-finished and not elaborated... For example, if memory and bad stuff are erased, why did babies cry and how could people remember each other's names? Besides, in the event of mind control, there is always communication control, and persons like The Giver are never let loose and alone.Well, the 1st half or so was more or less, but the certain escape with the baby was really ridiculous, paving the way for nonsensical ending... And the reasoning prevailing in the movie is hardly universal - there are lots of people in the world who would exchange war, destruction, poverty, violence, etc. for the clean and secure environment, even at the expense of emotions as they have felt nothing but misery. Not my thoughts only, but proved via polls and research.Thus, The Giver is just another mind-twister for the younger audience in ""nice"" places, who feel support from their friends and family, and who still think that the world is invitingly open.",The Giver
33,stevendbeard,Confusing,4,15 August 2014,"I saw ""The Giver"", starring Jeff Bridges-R.I.P.D., Iron Man; Meryl Streep-Hope Springs, Julie & Julia; Brenton Thwaites-Maleficent, Oculus and Katie Holmes-Jack and Jill, Batman Begins.This is based on a series of books-I think it's been 4, but don't quote me on that-that are written by Lois Lowry. I have not read them so I can not compare this adaptation to the books, but I do know that the age of Brenton is different; his character is 12 in the books but 18 in the movie. Anyway, the story takes place in the future, after some kind of world ending apocalypse has happened and humans have started over. They live on a mountain top surrounded by mists and take daily injections that keep their emotions in check. That way, it's a perfect world where people do not have emotions and everyone is happy-yeah, because they are drugged into complacency. When children reach the age of 18, they are assigned their life time jobs by the governing council that is lead by Meryl-this part reminded me of the film, Divergent. Brenton is just hitting that magical age of 18 and gets chosen to be the new Receiver. A receiver knows all the past human history and advises the council whenever they are asked. Jeff plays The Giver, that transfers all the knowledge to the receiver by holding his arms. After Jeff is finished with the training, he can then retire. The movie starts out in black & white-to signify how bland the world has become-and becomes colorized to Brenton, as he gains knowledge of the past. The more he learns, the more he wants to spread the revelations with everyone else but the way he is supposed to do that is a little confusing-at least it was to me. All he had to do was leave the border surrounding the city and Voila!Knowledge would just flood back and wake up the people. Katie plays Brenton's emotionless mother. There is a short cameo by Taylor Swift, as a former receiver that did not make it through the training. FYI: This movie is not for smaller kids-hence the PG-13 rating-because there is a scene of someone killing and disposing of a baby-remember, they are emotionless. It's rated ""PG-13"" for the violence and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 34 minutes. I did not care for this one and would not buy it on DVD. I don't think I would even rent it, either. Unless you are a big fan of the books, I would wait until it comes to cable TV.",The Giver
34,drqshadow-reviews,"Flat, Blunt and Obvious - Could've Shone with More Subtlety and Better Production",3,22 September 2016,"Fed up with the innate faults of mankind, an isolated post-war society has effectively eliminated emotion from their lives. That, mixed with a reliance upon automated support, makes for a peaceful utopia but also a rather empty, robotic one. Predictably, that leads to conflict as one teen discovers the pleasures left behind in the name of peace, health and prosperity, and rebels against the establishment to return humanity's lost feelings. It sounds like the ground floor of an excellent premise, but that's really all there is to it. No nuance, subtlety or undercurrent, just a straight, flat take on how essential it can be to live and feel. The concept is never as high as it thinks it is, and the execution is often downright laughable. That blame can be evenly shared between the acting, which ranges from bad to raspberry-worthy, and the effects work. Several times, the screen goes quiet to make room for a stunning, revelatory visual feast, but nothing ever arrives. Even something as simple as the gradual introduction of color to a black-and-white landscape, evidencing the protagonist's awakening to the world's lost wonders, feels underwhelming and bland. The whole package is undercooked (a shame, as it was evidently a labor of love for producer/supporting star Jeff Bridges) and so painfully simple-minded that it scarcely feels heavy enough to stock a short film. Dig deep and you'll find something worth thinking about here, but the duty of cultivating and nourishing that seedling is left entirely to the audience.",The Giver
35,jimbo-53-186511,"Unoriginal and predictable, but these are the least of the problems here",4,1 October 2015,"The Giver offers a very slight twist on themes that we've seen time and time before in films such as Equilibrium, Dark City, Minority Report and it even has a touch of The Shining about it. I believe that Divergent and Insurgent are similar as well, but having not seen either of those films I can't really say anymore than that. I am a fairly forgiving person and will not normally hate on a film that isn't original (how many times have we seen various versions of the same film???). The problem with a film like The Giver is that it gets more and more preposterous as it goes along and goes way beyond the point of suspension of disbelief being applicable. I also wasn't impressed by the constantly flitting between black and white and colour - stick with one or the other (to me it felt a little artsy and pretentious).I'm aware that this is based on a book, but I haven't read it so these comments are going to be qualified based on the film only. The first issue I had with this film was the idea that it has a 'receiver of memory' and a 'giver of memory'. Yes the film does refer to two people as 'Givers' and 'Receivers' - whilst presumably these names have been given innocently, the terminology is wrong for obvious reasons. If the Elders don't want people to be able to re-discover their memories, why have someone there who is able to pass on these memories to someone else and risk the 'receiver of memory' telling everyone about these memories?? If you don't want people to know, why have someone there who can tell one person about these memories and risk a mass escape? Yes we learn that it's a test, but why and for what purpose?? Although I got the film's message I just felt that it was delivered in an idiotic manner.Then we come to Jonas' escape which was utterly ridiculous; prior to his escape he is being watched constantly and the Elders pick up on him telling people about his work as a receiver of information. You get the impression it's a Big Brother style utopia where any conversation that's going on will be picked up by the Elders.... but yet Jonas manages to escape and the Elders fail to notice this till after he's gone... The big problem here is that for the most part the story is dull and ponderous and when it does try to be exciting it ruins these moments by making them totally implausible. There's all this fantastic technology here, but the boundary of the Utopia has no wall or force field to prevent people escaping???The only thing I actually liked about this film was some of the commentary that it offered on living where everyone's memory has been erased; I liked the way that the film got you thinking about the pros and cons of living in a society where everyone thinks and acts the same which results in a conflict-free society. On the other side of the coin, the film also argues the case that good or bad everyone has the basic right to feel and remember (which ultimately makes us human). Some interesting points, but sadly the plot-holes and the dull plodding story do hold it back slightly making it a somewhat underwhelming experience.",The Giver
36,3xHCCH,The Essence of Human Existence,7,4 September 2014,"I have read the book by Lois Lowry which was written a little more than twenty years ago. With the popularity of dystopian movies made from young adult novels like ""Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"", it is only now that ""The Giver"" was also made into a film.I read this book because it was the required reading of my son in sixth grade and I would like to know what my kids are made to read. I found this book to be mature and very interesting as it presents the reader a utopian society in the future -- a society of artificially-engineered peace and strict rules -- no memory, no grey areas, no emotion. When a kid reaches 12 years old, they are assigned the occupation which they will be performing for the rest of their lives. For Jonas though, he was chosen for a special role, that of the Recipient of Memories. As his job title indicated, he will be receiving the memories denied the rest of the populace from the previous Recipient of Memories, henceforth now called The Giver.While the movie sticks pretty much to the story of the book, there were some significant changes. In the film, the age of assignment was upped to 18. This of course conveniently gave leeway for a possible love angle among the characters which did not happen in the book. However, this also made his decisions and actions more reasonable than it felt while reading the book.The other significant change involved the ending. The book had a very vague sudden ending in which it was not even clear what the fate of Jonas was. There was nothing unclear about the ending in the film. In fact, the events following the supposed ending of the book were all laid out and expanded in detail. I personally felt there was too much detail given in this regard. A little mystery could have been left open for the viewers to ponder on.The look of the film though is outstanding. It started in stark black and white, slowly gaining in color as Jonas learned more about what real life was all about. The futuristic set -- the island nestled in the clouds, the dwelling places, the bicycles, the nursery, the ceremonial hall, the costumes -- all looked so good and ideal as they should. The senior cast was very impressive with Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges leading it. Streep does as only Streep can in the role of the all- knowing, all-powerful Chief Elder, who controlled everything in their utopia. Bridges is especially outstanding as he conveyed the painful responsibility and abject loneliness of being the Giver very well. His knowledge was his torture. Brandon Thwaites does very well in the lead role of Jonas. You do get the impression though that everything happened too quickly for him, but that is the fault of the storytelling and not the actor himself. It would have been better if Jonas' awakening happened more subtly than the abrupt way it was shown here. Pretty Odeya Rush is very good as Jonas' school friend Fiona. She was able to portray the confusion her character felt as Jonas' shared with her the new truths he is learning each day. Watch out for a short cameo by pop singer Taylor Swift, whom I did not immediately recognize. Her performance though was not really too remarkable.Overall, this was a very well-made film. The cinematography is so clean and crisp. The music is haunting, especially that song over the closing credits by OneRepublic. It is admittedly underwhelming compared to the more action-packed dystopian young adult films so popular nowadays. It is really unfair to compare them that way.

Knowing how to feel and love is the essence of human existence.",The Giver
37,aharmas,"A colorless life, but a vibrant tale",8,17 August 2014,"""The Giver"" from the movies is certainly different from the original text, yet one can't be disappointed because it remains faithful to many of its elements. Looking at the incredible work done by the designers, one has to admit that this is a fairly accurate representation of what a sterile, safe, and totalitarian society probably would like in the future. The general population follows the rules automatically, with minor exceptions, and the illustrious leaders make sure their presence is respected and understood. People appear to be content.As usual, some people might wonder how some very substantial parts of the novel are dealt with in a very rushed manner when so much care was given to bringing the book to life, and this includes acting by most of the seasoned actors. Streep should be proud that her elder role can join her best work, and Bridges was born to play the unhappy title character.A much older Jonas is now the official receiver of memories in this society, and he's the hope that can restore stability to this utopia. It looks like the previous candidate wasn't able to handle the demands of the assignment. This is a crucial role in the book and relegated to a few minutes here, and mercifully so because it's played by a non-actor and couldn't probably hurt the movie.The Giver and Jonas meet to perform their expected duties. Here is where one can see that the Giver has specific plans. Somehow the lead Elder suspects this but allows the plan to go on. There's a tacit understanding of what is needed in the society, and in a parallel way, the Elder and the Giver have parted ways, though it looks like they were either very close or related in the past.Whereas the book allows you to meditate about what's happening to Jonas and his transition into ""adulthood"" is more traumatic because of what he discovers through the Giver's intervention, here the older Jonas still suffers through the sudden trauma of being exposed to the dark periods of man's history, it doesn't quite hit us with the pain of a 12 year old that suddenly has his beliefs shattered when he discovers the truth behind his perfect world and family.There are remarkable improvements as the world is graphically depicted so we can see how technology serves many purposes, among them the comfort, safety and protection of its inhabitants. However, it is very clear that the reins are tight, and this requires a special forces that spies on every aspect of its people. It's chilling to see when files are pulled how there's absolutely no privacy for anyone here.The casting is very good, giving us a coldly efficient Holmes, playing an official of some kind who fears that her family and her world are destroyed by chaos. Her husband is even more interesting because he's the softer of the two, but what truly astounds us is how he's unable to really bond with anything. He knows the expressions he's supposed to use, but they're robotic deliveries, and this is horrific to see when he deals with the problem of having to release one of the twins during his daily job.People might be either very pleased with the last scenes in the film when we see Jonas try to escape from his world to save himself, Gabriel, and eventually the rest of the world. The film makes perfectly clear that he somehow achieves his goal, but just like the book, there is a doubt that this is all wishful thinking or a dream because. Here we are next to the idyllic dream of his, a place where love, family, and warmth coexist peacefully, or don't they?",The Giver
38,peterp-450-298716,On itself it's a good movie. It only drowns in a tangle of similar dystopian films.,6,23 September 2014,"""Everything is connected. Everything is balance. Where there is good, there is bad."" Can you imagine yourself a world without colors? A dull society where everyone is equal because some social values ​​were smoothed and human emotions such as joy, passion, wonder, lust and love were banished. All this to ensure that conflicts won't arise anymore. This seems to me quite frightening. Of course, this also provides a number of positive benefits, such as the non-existence of hatred,revenge, jealousy and imperious feelings. Everything for a conflict-free and serene society. A kind of bungalow-park in the clouds where everyone apologizes all the time for everything and nothing (""We accept your apology."") And that's how ""The Giver"" begins. In slight nondescript gray tones. For those who just start watching this movie without knowing anything about it, here's a warning. Don't check the color settings of your TV. There's nothing wrong with it. It's a colorless society where all the survivors live after the big disaster,which they call ""The Ruin"". It's an unexplained global disaster that ensured that the earthlings now live in a sort of commune. A commune where everyone obediently gets their medication injected every morning, so that they are protected from all those obnoxious human traits which lead to catastrophes. This society also gives you an Orwellian feeling. At the slightest wrong move or contact, an almost ethereal voice begins to admonish you. And as certain irregularities may happen, even a holographic projection of one of the elderly could suddenly appear in the middle of your kitchen. A peaceful society where the inhabitants are pampered in the superlative and walk through life like meek lambs.Memories are also erased, so no one can make an association with the old human values. The complete human history, up to the time of ""The Ruin"", is unknown to all residents. Except for ""The Receiver of Memories"". This chosen person has only one mission. And that's to cherish all these memories and memorize them in case they are needed in certain circumstances. Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) is a carefree teenager who gets to hear during the ""Release to elsewhere"" ceremony, a ritual in which the teenagers of a certain age are assigned tasks that they will perform all their lives, that he's assigned to this high function. And so he's being taught by the former ""Receiver"" (Jeff Bridges) who hands over his former memories and feelings just by physical contact. And so the former ""Receiver"" automatically gets the function as ""The Giver"". In this way Jonas experiences what it's like to live in a colorful world. He witnesses pleasant feelings such as love, joy and happiness. And also human tragedies and the associated unpleasant feelings such as pain, loss and grief.""The Giver"" is yet another adaptation of a book in which we are introduced to a dystopian world. We have seen this already in ""Elysium"", ""The Hunger Games"" and recently ""Divergent"". An unknown apocalypse recreated earth in an inhospitable place where the survivors have rallied in a kind of commune where new values ​​and standards are introduced. The book served as the basis for this movie, is a bestseller from 1993 written by Philip Noyce. As in ""Divergent"" youngsters get assigned their task of life at a certain age. In ""Divergent"" they can choose for this function. And in all these films, there is a coordinating organization who is running the show and of course a young person who is special in a way and is the cause for profound changes in the system. Probably everything will be as before again, so society is doomed to relapse into its original destructive habits.Overall, I liked ""The Giver"". It's an enjoyable film and at some level even better than its predecessors. Brenton Thwaites plays the youthful innocence convincingly and the metamorphosis from a numb jaded person into a rebellious teen is beautifully executed. The general atmosphere and presentation of this future society was worked out beautifully. Even Jeff Bridges could fascinate me (more than in R.I.P.D.), although he sometimes sounded like a poorly lubricated lawnmower. The policies adopted in this seemingly conflict-free society and the way in which it was controlled, made me shiver with horror. In principle, the elimination of all the listed characteristics, made sure that no one is better or feels more than any other. And the hunger for power is non-existent. But ultimately the elderly are still superior and define the guidelines in this commune. Who determines that all these people are being spied on and an intervention is needed when someone forgets to take his daily suppressive medication or looks with a lascivious glance at someone of the opposite sex? And even though feelings are suppressed, I found it a bit perplexing to see that birth control or the elimination of members of a multiple birth, after determining who is the strongest, was performed in such a cruel and inhumane way. Even the most callous and apathetic person realizes what he's doing. The biggest letdown was the lack or total absence of any tension. The tension is as flat and colorless as the images used in the run-up of the story. And of course there had to be a bit of romance in it. The strongest elements were the interaction between ""The Receiver"" and ""The Giver."" Fascinating, full of character and original. But for me the biggest asset is the fact that we probably won't get a series of consecutive episodes.As an isolated movie ""The Giver"" is anything but a bad movie. It only drowns in a tangle of similar dystopian films. The approach is original, but the overall picture isn't. And probably the book is way better than the film.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",The Giver
39,dierregi,"Teenage love trumps war, torture genocide and mass extinction",1,7 December 2016,"The most fun I had about this movie was reading some of the negative reviews. Especially the one mentioning the gingerbread man and the Christmas party.As for the film itself, it is based on a young-adult bestseller I did not read. Some of the reviewers were disappointed because it oversimplified the original plot. That is not the problem, because even with no comparison to its literary source the movie still sucks.In a dystopian future, seen already many times previously and done better, people have eliminated war at the cost of loosing their emotions. They live what looked to me reasonably happy lives in a safe environment, therefore a dark twist was added to this otherwise serene community.The plot follows a trio of youngsters: Jonas, Asher and Fiona, which reminded me of the Twilight triangle, minus the vampires. As usual, the young generation is mildly rebellious and our hero Jonas sets out to restore a fully emotional world to be able to enjoy his budding love story with Fiona. I personally did not see anything much wrong in Jonas world. As in most Hollywood-dystopian futures, fashion consists mostly of neutral, black or white clothes saving people a lot of time in deciding what to wear, there is weather control, zero unemployment, not much violent crime and no budgetary problems to support retirees.However Jonas thinks that torture, war, terrorism, genocide, cruelty to animals, etc... are a small price to pay to enjoy teenage love and the world must be reset to its miserable original state. Some corny footage of ethnic happiness is added to prove how much fun people have in our contemporary world, especially when confronting the police, dying or giving birth without pain killers.The three young leads are unremarkable actors. Surprisingly Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges are also in this. Bridges speaks with a slur, as if he is wearing dentures or a cotton ball in his mouth and is probably the most annoying character..",The Giver
40,Seraphion,Philosophical but that's just it,5,13 September 2014,"The movie is about Jonas, a young man in a Utopian community without bad things. Jonas and his friends Fiona and Asher graduate school and gets assigned their jobs. But he was assigned the unique job only one person per generation can do, The Receiver of Memories. His training is to gradually receive from The Giver the past memories from time before the community. They're unknown to anyone else in the community, such as culture, color but also about violence. He shares them with his family's newest member baby Gabe. Later they get to be more complex, about love and emotions; and he shares them with Fiona. One day Jonas accidentally receives the memory about war, scheduled for years to come. Thus Jonas quits his training. He wants to share the good things with Fiona, whom he asked to skip morning doses like he did after training starts. The Giver explains it as love. Jonas knows that if they're caught, they'll be 'released' to live in Elsewhere. The Giver shows him what 'releasing' really is, murder. Jonas is against it and proposes The Giver to give back the people their memory by going past the boundary of memory. He finds Gabe about to be released and revisits The Giver. He states that he's been waiting for Jonas all along; It's for Jonas to go and him to stay. On his way Jonas had to hurt Asher to get to The Giver. Asher alerts Jonas' family and the elders. Jonas finds Fiona in the place where Gabe is. The elders send police to catch Jonas as they observe recordings of Jonas' life the past few months. Jonas escapes as Fiona diverts the police' attention. He escapes over the community's edge but the elders sends Asher on a drone to track and find him. But Asher instead helps Jonas. The elders decide to release Fiona. And just as The Giver persuades the elders to stop, Jonas succeeds going past the boundary of memory, giving sense back to the community.The story is a nice philosophical idea about the nature of humanity; that even though our current state of community is bad in many senses, it's also still good in many more senses. In my opinion, the basic premise is quite the same as the one in Equilibrium (2002), only this movie has it more down played and more family friendly. The movie is successful in being philosophical, mainly using the coloration changes and the montages of contrasting images.Based on a book aimed for children, the movie feels quite lacking in this packaging aimed for the young adults. I don't really think it connects to the major audience of the young adults. The movie quite changed the book's background setting of Jonas' age, which is a clear attempt to relate it more to the young adult segment, from the book's previous aim at the children age group. But then again, from the very start the book's story just doesn't qualify from the informal rules for the young adult movies; some degree of fantasy, more romance, and a female main character. The effect is seen on the Box Office revenues which is not that much.The acting parts are just another okay overall. Brendan Thwaites felt a bit flat on his part, not really improving since I last saw him in The Signal (2013). Jeff Bridges did okay, maintaining his secretive character's nature, although with less use of expressions. Meryl Streep was nice in depicting the deceiving antagonist. It's nice to see known faces of Katie Holmes and Alexander Skarsgard. Too bad that Odeya Rush and Cameron Monaghan didn't really maximize their parts here.The set designing and technology depiction are done very nicely. It really helps to tell the futuristic element of the tale. But I think that they're a bit sacrificed by the use of the black and white coloration. The editing on the baby scenes are done very nicely, depicting the emotions just right.MY say is that The Giver (2014) deserves a score of 5 out of 10. A recommendation is still a yes from me because it's quite an entertainment that can keep us curious, especially those who haven't read the book.",The Giver
41,rgkarim,Beautiful Emotions and Decent Acting,7,16 August 2014,"Books are a means of allowing the imagination to unfold without a budget to hold back your creativity. Yet in Hollywood they are ultimately a means to write the next big blockbuster to draw people to the theaters. This weekend yet another adapted screenplay comes to life in the form of the Giver. Haven't heard of the book? Neither had I until about three weeks ago, so I was excited to see what this movie had in store. What were my thoughts on the film? Read on to find out. The Giver is not the most exciting tale, merely another story about a utopia where everything is controlled and all negative aspects have been eliminated. At the beginning of the movie, the pace is a little slow, a mere introduction into the world and all its endeavors. It is not until we meet the Giver (Jeff Bridges) that things begin to pick up and thing become much more interesting. The Giver trains his protégée Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) to take on his new job as the Receiver, learning the memories of the past in order to guide the future. While not the most unique story, this tale is interesting in the way it is executed as both cinematography and acting come together to make a fantastic presentation. We'll start with the cinematography and editing first. The black and white world hasn't been seen in a popular movie since the Artist, but this time we have sound to go along with our nostalgic filter. The lack of color sort of drains you of your emotions, which falls in line with the emotions of the town. As Jonas learns more about the past, things begin to change though and the developing team begins to subtlety introduce colors back to the film. It gradually adds excitement to the film, running parallel to the evolving story and characters within it, until the exciting, albeit downgraded, climax. Perhaps the greatest source of emotion though come from the memories that the two protagonists share. The directors selected great clips to entertain us with, starting simple at first and gradually diving deeper down the rabbit hole. Each memory brings about it a new set of feelings each further developing Jonas to make the choices he makes. Between each of these memories we have Jonas reintroduced back into the world, seeing it through different eyes as he contemplates the inner workings. Often these realizations bring back more colors, as well as further pieces of the puzzle to solve. It is balanced, and very good at teaching us lesson with the emotions that well up with each scene. Here I will warn you to exercise caution with younger minds, for some of the darker memories may be a bit too much, sad or disturbing, for smaller children to handle. Of course the camera can only do so much, and movies require actors to assist in bringing the players to life. Bridges is my favorite of the bunch, his rugged approach to characters providing the right gruff to make anything both funny and serious at the same time. His sarcastic delivery and straight to the point approach provides both entertainment and lesson, helping to alleviate the tension that builds up in the movie. Thwaites' chemistry with him is good, the boy not only reacting to the new memories, but also trying to handle everything that comes with them. While a bit overacted at parts, Thwaites manages to pull off the role well and was quite enjoyable to watch. While these two are the bread and butter of the movie, the supporting characters have some good acting to further enhance the story. The talented Meryl Streep brings the Chief Elder to life, not necessarily evil, but with evil like qualities she used to maintain order. Streep's voice was perfect for the role of a supreme leader, and her elegant features complemented the monotone suit well. Playing kind of the second in command is Katie Holmes, whose track record has been mixed in terms of acting quality. For this reviewer, she did a great job playing the stern mother, using her stoic facial features from the past to really bring a sense of threat and discipline. Holmes has played plenty of no nonsense roles and she slips right back into the role that both annoyed and impressed me at the same time. Odeya Rush is a very cute actress, who has a great talent for line delivery, executing her lines with the right emotions with the right emphasis. She does have to work a little on her voice breaking, because some her lines sounded more like whining than acting for me. Yet she does a nice job of changing out her acting style as the characters change. Even Taylor Swift makes an appearance in this movie, though her acting hasn't greatly changed from her earlier roles. To wrap this review up, The Giver is a thoroughly enjoyable movie by how fantastic the emotions are presented. This is a movie that does a great job at teaching lessons, and doing it without the cheesy dialog that often makes Facebook quotes. The combination of visuals and acting are some of the best I've seen in a while, and have not been overshadowed by high explosive special effects. Yet it is not the most exciting movie and has some stretches to accept in order to get the full effect. Is it worth the trip to the theatre? I would say not necessarily so, because there isn't a lot made for the big screen, though I'm not saying you are wasting your money if you do go see it. My scores for The Giver are:Drama/Sci-Fi: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.5",The Giver
42,rannynm,"To bring such a loved and popular book, with tons of deep ideas and themes, and execute as wonderfully as Director Philip Noyce and company do, is great.",9,20 August 2014,"Full of theories on life and enough ideas to cause you to rethink your own ideas, The Giver is an intense film about the effects of accepting the good and bad things memories of life. Being a huge Meryl Streep fan (Chief Elder), I was very excited to see her performance and, I was not disappointed. Jeff Bridges' (The Giver) performance gives this film a veteran presence that adds to the wisdom their characters possess. As for Brenton Thwaites (Jonas) and Odeya Rush (Fiona), their performances show great promise for their careers. Their youth and lack of experience add a sense of naïveté to their characters that beautifully contradicts with the characters played by both Streep and Bridges. I find the script a bit pretentious but necessarily so. The premise itself is very complex but suitable for the subject matter. What could have 90 minutes of melodrama turns into brilliant and intelligent conversations thanks to the skills of the ensemble. I give an Oscar nod for both Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges.There is a scene towards the end of the film where The Giver and Chief Elder debate on the pros and cons of memories and allowing people to make decisions. That is one of the very best acted scenes I've seen this year. The dialogue is so poetic that we're drawn into the fantasy instead of repulsed by its theatrical nature.My favorite part of the film, second to Meryl's performance, is the beautiful cinematography by Ross Emery. Mr. Emery and Editor Barry Alexander Brown really come together wonderfully to create awesome moments of visual storytelling. The mixture of black and white with color, and the short shots of real life events give this film a certain vivacity the book is unable to give.This film is really quite an achievement. To bring such a loved and popular book, with tons of deep ideas and themes, and execute as wonderfully as Director Philip Noyce and company do, is great. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and really hope you see it. It opens theatrically on August 15.

43,Rob_Taylor,A most surprisingly good movie.,7,20 September 2014,"I have to say that this movie surprised me. Surprised me because it is my least favourite genre (dystopian teen movie) and I'm predisposed to dislike those after recent outings like Divergent and TV shows like The 100.So it was a very pleasant surprise to find that this movie gripped me all the way through. This is especially good, since I missed the first ten minutes or so of the showing and had to jump in cold with no idea of what was going on.To be devil's advocate, the plot wasn't hard to figure out, and I found the rest of the movie to play through nicely to a conclusion that, whilst a little perplexing, was at least satisfying.Later, when I thought about why this movie had succeeded for me where others in this genre have have failed, I managed to identify a few points which raised this effort above those of much more heavily budgeted films.Firstly, the main protagonist, whilst a teen, was treated as a young adult and not an idiot. Though he became a bit of a slave to his hormones, we were never treated to an improbable romance as Divergent foisted off on us. In other words, he wasn't made out to be a helpless fool.Secondly, the running time. Just a little over an hour and a half. Yet they managed to set the scene and bring the dystopia crashing down all in that time and, for the most part, it didn't feel that rushed. It was refreshing to see a self-contained movie that did not batter us over the head at the end, saying ""Nyah nyah! It's not over yet! We're going to string this out for at least another two movies!""A third point was the more realistic nature of the dystopia. A society that drugs its inhabitants into submission and orderliness. You won't find any implausible caste system here. No pointless test to determine your future or anything like that. It was plausible.So, I missed the first ten minutes or so, so I didn't get the scene setting, so it is possible I missed some inanity or narrated nonsense. But the rest of the film was solid and fun and the struggle within the young teen's heart and mind believable and done generally very well. There were a few plot points I frowned at, but again, that may be because of something I missed early on.Acting was decent and the presence of Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges helped with that greatly, but all the cast gave good performances.All in all, a nice effort that restores my faith that a teen dystopian movie can be good.SUMMARY: Much better than the idiotic efforts of some recent similar movies. Decent acting, decent setting (for once!), and a tight, focused approach to editing, made this an enjoyable experience.",The Giver
44,pc95,"Decent Sci-Fi, but Unoriginal",6,24 December 2014,"I liked ""The Giver"" fairly well. Directed by Phillip Noyce, it is focused and pretty well written. One of the main issues though with the movie is it doesn't have much to add to the sci-fi genre - no it has much in the way of clichéd ideas borrowing from Divergent, but with a much cleaner and more focused story. The cast features a fairly good ensemble of actors, but the turning point of the story is banal and uninspiring (spoiler) - the returning of memories. As it is there are certainly worse movies available. And the movie ends on a more hopeful tone. Even so, there needs to be better ideas and a better ending - this is not as good as similar but more cerebral ""Logan's Run"" from the mid-70s. 6/10",The Giver
45,bob-rutzel-1,Engaging,9,7 December 2014,"Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) lives in a world that outlaws emotion, but all is peaceful throughout and there is never talk of war. Memories have been erased, occupations are assigned and inhabitants are given daily injections to ward off emotions. Jonas learns, from The Giver (Jeff Bridges), that the world and life were not always so peaceful and that Pain and Emotions thrived in the past as did Love. Jonas receives the truth of the past and wants to do more and avoids his daily injection. He needs to change the world. Can he do it? Inquiring Minds need to know. I have read that Jeff Bridges had wanted to have this story come to life for many years and the role of The Giver was to be his father , Lloyd Bridges, but he died and Jeff Bridges took the role of The Giver. In here you will be reminded, at times, of other movies: Divergent, Pleasantville and The Hunger Games.The Pull in here are the conversations between Jonas and The Giver. One wishes there were more of these conversations as they were enlightening. Meryl Streep as the Elder in Charge of everything doesn't want anything to change, of course, and is quite charming in her understated manner of speaking. Yes, charming even though she is the ""bad guy"" in here. The acting all around is outstanding. I would give a Best Actor Oscar to Jeff Bridges as he was the glue that made all this quite engaging. The movie should have been much longer than it was and the ending needed to have more of an impact. Still this is an important and engaging movie with many messages to think about.

46,moviexclusive,"Far better than your average YA-lit adaptation, this thought-provoking and visually stimulating scifi offers a compelling portrait of human nature at its best and worst",7,19 August 2014,"At this point, you can be forgiven for feeling fatigued by the recent glut of YA-lit adaptations of the dystopian variety, but before you write off 'The Giver', know that Lois Lowry's Newbery Medal-winning novel in fact pre-dated Suzanne Collins' 'The Hunger Games' and Veronica Roth's 'Divergent' by about 18 years. And that means, rather than the other way round, both Collins and Roth probably got some of their ideas from Lowry's 1993 bestseller, although ironically it took both these hits to convince that 'The Giver' was ripe for the big screen.Instrumental in shepherding this long-gestating adaptation from print to screen is Jeff Bridges, who plays the titular character that is so named because he is only one that holds the collective remembrances of a long- gone society. The rest of its members know not of where they came from, but only of what is necessary - in order to prevent a repeat of the catastrophe which led to the collapse of mankind (referred to as The Ruin), the all-seeing and all-hearing Council of Elders deemed it essential to eliminate difference and emphasise sameness through a conduct of strict rules, imposed politeness and language precision, as well as a daily dose of medication which suppresses feelings.It is also within this context that it had been decided there should only be one person amidst the community who knows their history, his role to offer advice to the elders when the need arises. That is the responsibility for which our lead protagonist Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) has been selected for at a ritualised graduation ceremony marking his transition from adolescence to maturity, his weighty mantle of Receiver of Memories in contrast to the more commonplace roles which his good buddy Asher (Cameron Monaghan) or his teenage crush Fiona (Odeya Rush) have been chosen for - as a drone pilot or a Nurturer for newborns respectively.So Jonas goes off daily to the edge of the known world to learn from The Giver, a wise but jaded Elder still reeling from his failed prior attempt to pass on his knowledge to a young woman named Rosemary (Taylor Swift in a glorified cameo). Yet Jonas isn't just learning the memories as if they were facts off an encyclopaedia; rather, he is experiencing them through the Giver, these feelings spanning a gamut from emotional highs, sensory rushes, music, dance, and most of all, the concept of love. Why would anyone want to deny others the opportunity to feel such joys, Jonas asks?It is only logical therefore that Jonas defies the rules to share the pleasures of feeling with his loved ones - his family (Alexander Skarsgard and Katie Holmes as his parents and Emma Tremblay as his little sister) and Fiona - much to the chagrin of the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep), who regards his behaviour as nothing less than sedition. But Jonas' struggle is both within and without; even as he tries to escape the grasp of the Chief Elder and her security forces sent to retrieve him, he finds himself struggling to come to terms with the darker side of human nature - violence, war, greed and tragedy.At the end of the day, Lowry poses this question to her readers, a question which this adaptation retains with sparkling clarity. Is it possible for mankind to choose love, not hate, peace, not war, and choice, not denial? Of course, the movie does, like the book, take a stand against sameness by emphasising the beauty in diversity, and above all, the wonder of experience. Purists may object to certain liberties which Michael Mitnick and Robert B. Weide's screenplay takes with the book, but we're glad to say however that the essence of Lowry's classic remains beautifully captured here.Director Phillip Noyce does take the movie one step further than the book by using colour as metaphor - the first half hour unfolds in flat black and white, gradually transitioning from muted to saturated colour by the time it reaches the extended action climax. Amidst the burst of colour, his choice of montages from sunsets to tribal dances to Renaissance wedding ceremonies to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protest and even Nelson Mandela is stirring to say the very least, and it's hard not to be moved by his personal salute to the human spirit.Just as convincing is Thwaites, the actor best remembered for his role as the handsome prince in 'Maleficient' acquitting himself well with an engaging yet thoughtful performance that we hope puts naysayers' doubts to rest about upping Jonas' age in the movie. Bridges lends a steady old hand playing the grizzled Giver, though it is a pity that he doesn't share more scenes with Streep, whose acting talents are grossly underused in a nondescript villainous role that doesn't require her to do much more than look menacing - yes, Bridges and Streep do share a scene towards the end of the movie, and boy are these veterans compelling to watch.Thankfully, the same can also be said of the movie as a whole, which will more than banish any skepticism you may have about it due to genre (and possibly, thematic) fatigue. Yes, 'The Giver' may follow in the wake of more higher-profile franchises like 'The Hunger Games' or 'Divergent', but it Is easily more thought-provoking than either of them as a cautionary tale against conformity and obedience. Is the world a better place without emotion? Is the world a better place without diversity? Should life be led as choice or conformity? In a summer with too much bombast, this is a surprisingly intelligent little picture that deserves to be seen.",The Giver

48,maurice_yacowar,Teen rebel recovers society's suppressed memories and emotions,7,25 August 2014,"In both Lois Lowry's book and Phillip Noyce's movie, The Giver pulls a dystopian world view out of a basic adolescent frustration. Jonas and Fiona discover first stirrings of love — but any physical demonstration, or even the use of the word, not to mention respect for the emotion, is severely forbidden by the adult world. As any teen would understand, the grownups have forgotten what love means. That grey world is bereft of emotions, memories and humanity. Hence the film's palette from the 40s, film grise. Jonas's original assignment is — as Receiver — to receive the race's memories from the Giver. In the latter role Jeff Bridges is the depository of all experience and wisdom — in other words, the Anti-Dude, a reversal of his persona. But when he spurs his young charge to break his fetters and the restraints that oppress the entire society, the Dude rises again. The film's broader statement is our loss of humanity when we try to reduce life to the safe and the neutered. Without pain, grief, war, we miss the positive extensions of love and faith and hope. In the film's ultimate endorsement of adolescent solipsism, Jonas has only to sled through a vaporous barrier and he will restore the entire community's lost collective memory, recovering their lost emotional spectrum. One sentient kid can save mankind. This is Footloose on steroids.Fiona's professional touch with infants and Jonas's commitment to baby (angel) Gabriel contrast to all the other characters' unfeeling treatment of babies. The heroes' instincts emphasize the unnaturalness of the system (which derives from Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, inter alia). Gabriel's name echoes his Biblical forbear who heralded the new kingdom. His extraordinary patience through the arduous wintry trek suggests he already senses the seriousness of his mission, so he's not going to act up. A worthy model for every infant seated behind me on any flight.As the society's head Meryl Streep's capacity to teleport herself anywhere and to materialize and dematerialize there at will has the incidental effect of embodying the insubstantiality of her power and principles. In contrast, the Giver can rematerialize a scene from his past while remaining tangibly present. His powerful memory trumps her power of willful amnesia.The title suggests the Bridges character is the central one. No, it's still Receiver Jonas, who grows into the title mantle when — after receiving the Giver's range of instruction — he breaks out to become a Giver himself, before his time. He gives Gabriel back his life, Fiona her first intimation of emotion, and his society their hearts and minds back.",The Giver

Well it has all the ingredients to make a good story, adventure, thriller and mystery but never really pulls it off or it pulled it off and went over my mature adult little head. Acting is good and the plot carries you from one scene to the next. This is as it should be in a good movie. So I watch & wait and follow along. I liked the movie and saw it all the way through but the ending leaves one unfulfilled and the rich details that would make this memorable and must see again are no where to be found. Potential untapped here. Yes see the movie. Snack away and do have conversation and questions while watching which adds to the interest quota but prepare for a WHAT? at a couple of points and at the end. One wonders what people who take books and make them into movies are thinking? Should they tweak it or display as presented or as they see it?

At the beginning of the story, the main character, Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) describes how society functions in an imagined Utopian future. There is no fear, want, competition, or conflict. Occupations are assigned after childhood, so individuals don't decide their vocations. The Elders in their infinite wisdom take care of all assignments. But interestingly, all members see only a black and white world without colour, which is used to great effect in the current film. And all activity is constantly monitored by cameras. Any member engaging in the slightest infraction can be confronted by an Elder.""Sameness"" has been implemented to create an ideal world, and all community members lack memory of a time ""before"" the current society. Members take an injection every day to quell the possibility of negative emotions. Hypothetically, there is no reason for envy since all physical needs are met, and the Elders determine every person's role in society. However, because there is no want, fear, conflict, etc., there are other emotions and experiences which are also left out. The story is about how a youth discovers those things which have been taken away from society in order to create a supposed Utopia.Three friends, Jonas, Fiona (Odeya Rush), and Asher (Cameron Monaghan) vow they will be friends forever, even after the ceremonies marking the ends of their childhoods and each will begin training in their newly-assigned vocations. The occupations include caring for children, education, etc. The older members of the society are ""released"" to an unknown place called ""Elsewhere"". At the ceremony, all the other youths have been assigned their new vocations, but Jonas appears to have been passed over for assignment. Towards the end of the ceremony, Chief Elder (Meryl Streep) announces that Jonas has been given a special assignment: he will be ""The Receiver of Memory"", the memories of the community from before the time of the Sameness Society. He will receive them from an older receiver, ""the Giver"" (Jeff Bridges).Jonas is highly intelligent and was chosen to be the Receiver of Memory. But as the Giver finds out, Jonas is also curious. As he learns about the many aspects of the world in the past through the memories of the Giver, he begins to question the role of society ""forcing"" people into a world lacking emotions. He finds, to his dismay, that a very real emotion has been suppressed to create this Utopia. And he also discovers the term ""release"" has a much darker meaning which has been hidden from the understanding of the general populace.A very interesting and entertaining Utopian-dystopian SF story. Although certainly some of the themes have been explored in other Dystopian works, such as ""1984"" and ""Logan's Run"", this one describes the world from a youth's perspective. Logan of ""Logan's Run"" was in his late 20's, and Winston Smith of ""1984"" was in middle age. Jonas of ""The Giver"" is probably in his teens. My only criticism was I thought there needed to be another chapter at the end, although that may be covered in future installments.",The Giver
51,thekarmicnomad,Footloose with added sci-fi mumbo-jumbo,6,6 September 2017,"This is a a dystonian world everyone is happy and peaceful but without emotions or free will. Until the main character shows up.We have been here before, but this is a nice attempt at a retelling. The production and camera work is quite nice and the acting is pretty good. The awakening of the senses is well handled and is the high light of the film.For me though this film was doomed from the start. The dystopia is actually quite appealing. We are told that no one has emotions, yet they do - otherwise the audience wouldn't engage with the characters - they are just dialled right back. So the writers have to throw in random problems to make the world worth rebelling against. So all of a sudden people are drowning babies for no apparent reason.The writing really fails near the end. As restrictive dystopias go the inhabitants here sure get a lot of space when they go rouge.Then with a few minutes of screen time left the writers have to end this thing some how. This seems an impossible task, so they throw a smoke bomb on the floor and do a runner out the fire escape in the confusion.Has promise and some really nice sequences, but is ultimately baffling and stupid.",The Giver
52,bryank-04844,"'The Giver' is a solid try, but compared to the other big budget Young Adult franchises, it falls short.",3,12 August 2015,"Here we are with yet another Young Adult franchise that is based off a series of books. This time around, we have Phillip Noyce's adaptation of Lois Lowry's 1993 big selling book 'The Giver'. I can't believe it's been more than twenty years since that book came out. If you are unfamiliar with the story, don't feel left out, for you have probably seen or heard this story a few times before. 'The Giver' takes place in a man-mad Utopia of sorts where people are void of human emotion by choice and force, thus no violence or wars could happen again.Everyone is living peacefully without emotions or past memories from history. But filmmaker Noyce has decided to change a few aspects of the book to sell more movie tickets. In going along with the other Young Adult franchises, this too takes place in the future in a futuristic setting and takes the main character of the story, who is twelve years old in the book, and makes him a hot 18-year old stud (played by 25 year old Brenton Thwaites) to drive the young girls into theater seats. Sure you have Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Katie Holmes, and Alexander Skarsgard to peak the interest of some adults, but this film adaptation lacks the character development, story, and thrills that the other franchises have going for it, and therefor I don't see it doing 'Hunger Games' type of business at the box office.The film has a good chunk of it in black and white, as that is the way the characters in the movie see things and everyone. Jonas (Thwaites) and his two best friends Asher and Fiona (Cameron Monaghan and Odeya Rush) spend their days learning to exist in this utopian society void of other feelings and like 'Divergent', are waiting to be places into one of several different types of work and housing, by way of a big ceremony in front of the entire population. The city itself is placed above the rest of the land, filled with clouds, where everyone lives in identical housing, and ride identical bikes.Before everyone leaves in the morning, they receive a daily injection that prevents everyone from having memories from their past and history. Everyone's memory travels to a single person known as the Receiver (played by Bridges, who appears to have some sort of mouth piece in to give him a more gruff speech.) On the day of the ceremony, the chief elder (Streep) doles out the appointed jobs to everyone in the graduation class. While Fiona gets to take care of newborns and Asher gets to fly drone planes, Jonas is given the task of the Receiver, which is basically the chosen one. Here is where the best part of the film comes into play.Bridges teaches Thwaites and shows him via telepathy what the world and humankind were like before this utopian society. Soon enough, Jonas begins to see color everywhere, and starts to figure out that maybe his society would be better off with feelings, emotions, and memories. In addition, Jonas starts to figure out the the elders are not who they seem to be. It's a good set up and Noyce does a good job with some small action scenes and overall look of the film. But where this movie doesn't live up to the imagination of the book is in its severe cheesiness predictability. It takes quite a long time to get where on its feet, and although it has a run time of 92 minutes with credits, it feels way over two hours.Thwaites does a good enough job here, but Monaghan and Rush steal the show from him at every point. I've seen Streep in much better, but I guess she wanted to jump on the Young Adult bandwagon here, but she chose poorly. And Bridges is as always likable, but again, his voice and weird jaw motion throws off his character. Skarsgard is as hilarious as he was when he was under the witch's spell to be a kind and decent person in 'True Blood' and Holmes' character could have been played by anyone else. Yes, there is a Taylor Swift cameo, but it shouldn't make you shudder. 'The Giver' is a solid try, but compared to the other big budget Young Adult franchises, it falls short.",The Giver
53,manitobaman81,Good,7,28 August 2014,"I would suggest renting it, or perhaps buying it if the price is right! An intelligent script, with direction that does it justice. In a seemingly perfect community, without war, pain, suffering, differences or choice, a young boy is chosen to learn from an elderly man about the true pain and pleasure of the ""real"" world. Even all the side characters are brilliantly played. It gives a picture of a backwards society that diminishes reality, where culminating incidents brought by suffered individuals show the truth. I found the film a little too dark and a little too slow as it moves to what seems like an inevitable bitter end. This film is worthy of all the hopes you have!",The Giver

Background music was cool as well. Acting was very good, short of excellent.I have to say that films like this would probably leave some kind of impression on me a long time ago, when I was a younger person. But at this time it does not, I will probably forget it quickly.All in all, if you are a younger person who is interested in futuristic films, it is a film to watch. Otherwise, you might freely skip it.",The Giver
55,ofpsmith,A really good adaptation.,9,30 August 2014,"This wasn't as good as the book, but I did feel it did justice to it's source material. Jeff Bridges was great as the giver, and the cinematography was brilliant. This is the plot. In a ""perfect"" community without, war, pain, emotions, color, or choice, Jonas (Brendon Thwaites)is living with his father (Alexander Skarsgard), mother (Katie Holmes), and sister Lily (Emma Tremblay). Everyone is assigned a role in the community by the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep) as are spouses, children, and basically everything. When Jonas and his friends, Asher (Cameron Monoghan)and Fiona (Odeya Rush) are assigned their occupations, Jonas is selected for the receiver of memory. This means that he goes to speak with the current receiver (Jeff Bridges). The reciever or giver as he is known gives Jonas memories of the way that things were before everything went to sameness. Jonas experiences visions of happiness, love, and color. He is enthralled but is unable to tell talk about these memories to Asher of Fiona. Jonas soon becomes isolated with his visions of color, and emotion. He finds an outlet for the isolation by giving memories to a baby that his dad brought from the nurturing center named Gabriel (Alexander Jillings). Jonas is at first flustered as to why the community went to do away with these memories. But when the giver gives him a memory of the Vietnam War is all comes clear to him. Jonas now is the only citizen or feels passion or sympathy for anything else. When he witnesses his father ""release"" Gabriel's twin, he takes Gabriel and runs away from the authority of the community. I shouldn't say anything more because I'll end up spoiling the movie. I have personally read the book. I don't think that this is as good as the book was but it's still pretty good. Bridges does his usual good job in the role and it really makes you think. I recommend it.",The Giver
56,Likes_Ninjas90,It's the flurry of memories filtering back into our minds of past events that makes us realise that we're in a controlled world that won't allow new ideas.,5,10 September 2014,"In Hollywood today the kids stay in the picture. Adapting young adult novels appealing to teenage girls has been financially successful and invited Hollywood to diversify and acknowledge a demographic it once neglected. The five Twilight films earned over $3 billion dollars while the first two Hunger Gamesfilms have gathered close to $2 billion dollars and Divergent earned $200 million alone with three sequels to follow. After these female-led actions films, The Giver is simply late to the party. The film seems derivative of the aforementioned movies but there is one crucial detail: Lois Lowry wrote her novel back in 1993, long before Stephenie Meyer, Suzanne Collins and Veronica Roth, whose novels were all published sometime in the last ten years. We can only judge the similarities of the film adaptations and not who was first to plagiarise the novelistic representation of a dystopian future.The world of The Giver is the film's best and most interesting component. It is a post-war dystopia where people have no memories of the past and live in cube-like houses where they take medication that suppresses emotions like love. It is described as ""a world where no differences are allowed"" because it is being conditioned to maintain true equality. The people in the world reflect this rigidity. Jonas (Brenton Thwaites from Home and Away) is a young man who is waiting to learn what role in society he is going to receive. His parents (Alexander Skarsgard and Katie Holmes) are robotic in the way they demand precision of language from him. While Jonas and his two friends Fiona (Odeya Rush) and Asher (Cameron Monaghan) are to receive their roles, Jonas is chosen to be Receiver of Memory. His is instructed by the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep) to work with The Giver (Jeff Bridges). The Giver gradually provides him with memories of war and conflict, which sparks new feelings and emotions Jonas discovers he has for Fiona. It is unfortunate it has taken so long to adapt this novel because it confirms Hollywood is unwilling to challenge young people with new ideas but reinforce old ones by finding novels that file safely into its formulas. Consider when Jonas and other children are presented their chosen role in society in front of everyone. Isn't this almost identical to the Sorting Hat of Harry Potter or the Choosing Ceremony in Divergent? It is crucial but confirmation the film relies on overused motivational speeches about liberation and how young people are their own heroes, no matter how weak they seem. But it's not as though The Giver is brainless. It is a matter of frequency. We have already seen many films recently where society is oppressed by governments and young people rejuvenate and free the world from the older generation. Daringness rarely follows except for a scene where a baby is to be euthanised via an injection, which is then softened by predictable Christian messages and imagery as the narrative transforms into its own version of the Nativity Story. On top of its safety-first approach and too much expositional dialogue, the disappointment of the script is the middle portion, the collection of the memories, which feels flimsy and so much like a first act setup that it shocks us to learn we're already into the final quarter with its weak action sequences and highly abrupt ending.Australian director Phillip Noyce has made several films about oppressive governments like Salt or most famously Rabbit-Proof Fence, which is about the Stolen Generation. He has done a solid job with the technical aspects showing the conditioned treatment of the world. The first major choice is shooting the film in black and white, with the grey complimenting the look of a highly sterile, emotionless world. The spaces in the film are also enclosed, like the houses, corridors and glass doors. An aerial shot shows the blocks of houses all made the same way which typifies how the entire world is standardised. There are also grey paths around the world that people walk on to show how their daily lives are being controlled. As Jonas earns his memories more colour filters into the world as he gains his emotions back. Some of the images he sees, like vision from the Vietnam War are occasionally vivid, which confirms how strong the visual components of the film are and how they drew me into the world for a little while.Less successful is how Noyce has directed the film's actors. The failure of the three kids to standout from other young actors is a combination of weak dialogue and characterisation but also a lack of charisma. Meanwhile, Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep provide predictable turns and unchallenging performances by their standards. Bridges, who was a producer, slurs his way through scenes all too expectantly and Streep shows little other than a cold glare from under some crazy looking long grey hair. Though initially intriguing because of its clever, sometimes beautiful visuals and the details of its world, the familiarity of the film eventually wears on us. Like Jonas in the film, it's the flurry of memories filtering back into our minds of past events that makes us realise that we're in a controlled world that won't allow new ideas.",The Giver

I cannot fathom how a society like theirs could exist when human nature will always overcome. It's very ""Wayward Pines"" except in The Giver they don't seem to know they are being oppressed. Even through I found the movie to be flawed I still enjoyed it. The idea was interesting and I wanted to explore their reality. It made me want to give the book a go.Each time the world became more vivid the movie got a little bit better. The anticipation continuously built up and then...the end turned out a bit lame. It didn't finish things off satisfyingly and was too abrupt. I was just looking for more.",The Giver
58,roedyg,engaging,7,5 January 2017,"Jeff Bridges plays an atypical role for him -- a mysterious, wise old man. Meryl Streep plays the chief bureaucrat, well intentioned, but icy. Brenton Thwaites plays Jonas a perfectly handsome young man, genetically designed for perfection, somewhat bland who is charged with being the repository of banned memories for the community.This movie takes place in the future after some ruinous global war. The powers that be have decided they must chemically suppress most emotion, and keep from everyone any memory of violence, starvation or evil, love, music or emotion. There is no believable explanation for suppressing the positive.Only two people are permitted to remember the past or to feel positive and negative emotion. They do not submit themselves to physical torture.It is a very regimented authoritarian society. People are assigned their careers. Babies are assigned to families for care. The death penalty is used for the slightest transgression. It is administered painlessly and compassionately.In parts of the movie, my corn-o-meter went off the scale. For example when crowds would chant ""Jonas"" for no apparent reason. There would often be wordless montages to show joy or evil with trite images.Jonas seemed highly attached to his adopted baby brother, but spends no time with him. That did not ring true for me.Most of the movie is fairly realistic with a dose of woo. Thoughts can pass from person to person by touching arms. The entire mentality of a city changed from some magic ray triggered because a boy went on a sleigh ride past a tower. This is goofier than a comic book plot.The movie is done like the Wizard of Oz, mostly in black and white but with touches of colour to suggest emotion.",The Giver
59,billygoat1071,Fitting In,4,28 August 2014,"The most obvious and cynical theory to come up with the existence of The Giver movie is the success of futuristic YA movies such as The Hunger Games and Divergent. Though, The Giver was never meant to be a YA book in the first place, and it's already a two decades old book that has been going through some controversies in the past. This movie is proof that Hollywood is just picking books randomly and turn them into movies to match the trend. The important question is does it stay true to what makes the story so great? Apparently not. Not because it's now starred with teenagers instead of twelve year olds, or it consists more action scenes. The film just hardly cares about the concept and gives more way to the corny clichés of the genre. The Giver does have a taste for a blockbuster, but the heart of the story is missing and that is definitely frustrating.The film introduces the story in the most typical way possible, which has the hero doing voice-over narration for the audience. It doesn't trust the concept either, so it has to immediately push the story to the familiar elements of the genre. This is not a new case, of course. Many young-adult novels with better narrative have been manipulated by formula. But the story itself isn't about a revolution or a love story, its main center is to rediscover the old natural world, no matter how beautiful and ugly it was, and contrast it to the new rigorous society that is peaceful yet terrifyingly naive. The relationship of Jonas with the Giver and unraveling through sociopolitical conspiracies is what makes it engaging, but again the movie doesn't have the love for that. Instead it uses its length more on the visuals where the director can do what he does best, which is to pull off some set pieces and grand designs. Unfortunately those parts don't do much to the story, it's nothing more than an exposition that is meant build up a thrilling climax that isn't and never meant to be thrilling at all. And to stay faithful to the source material's larger theme, during the chase at the last act, one of the characters ends up preaching out a sheer sentimental speech to the elders that feels terribly forced.How it created the communities looked cool though, with production and special effects that gives a spectacular sense of scale, and how the black-and-white world grow into colors is a fascinating watch, but I think those are the only things the filmmakers wanted to bring to life. Designing it as an action blockbuster doesn't necessarily sound like a bad idea, but skimming out the soul that made the story compelling is what tones everything down into another generic fantasy film. The acting is okay, as usual. Brenton Thwaites does have the looks of a hero, but he only leaves a few personality to the role, the most conspicuous one is the kid's curiosity. A more natural fit is Jeff Bridges who gives the gravity that should have been there throughout the film.The Giver may have the external vision; the events, culture, characters, and language stayed intact; but again, everything else suffers the same problem. The rich world it already provides is no more than a cool design, while replacing the unique narrative with clichés. And it's not good at one of its clichés either, the additional more focused romantic subplot is as underdeveloped as the others out there. There just isn't much love to the subtext, the movie is basically just fitting in to the era of young adult novels with bad politics and rebellion; but again and again the story is never about them. It's neither about the love story or the teen angst. Whatever point it tries to say, it would only lie at the idea, and the movie didn't spend much time to that. There is some interesting visuals to spare, but what's left here is just another bland teen fantasy movie.",The Giver
60,RevRonster,Not bad...needed more of a dramatic punch though.,6,26 December 2014,"For the most part, I liked ""The Giver."" There are some problems with it that really just makes it middle-of-the-road but those problems are never excruciatingly bad or even mildly irritating.Visually, the film is a feast. I love the costumes and the set design really made for a believable utopian future that the story takes place in. I also love the way the film used grayscale and color to represent the level at which Jonas came to remember the world the way it was. The story is also very interesting and is filled with interesting characters. Finally, all those characters are played by very talented actors and the cast is excellent.The only problem I had with the film was the fact the drama and emotion in the story lacks any weight to it and didn't have much of an impact. The story is still interesting and slightly engaging but I felt like there should have been a bigger punch to all the events of Jonas trying to change the established order. Maybe with a slightly longer running time the story could have been further developed to help this because, as it stands, the film feels like it moves too fast.""The Giver"" isn't terrible but it didn't live up to what it could have been. I still found the film entertaining and did enjoy itit just wasn't what it could or should have been.",The Giver
61,CinematicInceptions,Poorly executed.,4,6 April 2017,"If you liked this movie do not read this review because I'm going to rip it apart a bit. I think there was a lot of potential that really got missed in adapting the novel into a movie. There are some emotional themes that get explored about why everything that makes life painful also makes it beautiful. Both the book and the movie could have done a better job of having the events of the story contribute to this theme. Instead, the movie got weighed down by trying to increase the drama and stakes of the plot and trying to ride the coattails of The Hunger Games. Trying to make it appeal more to modern audiences is a perfectly fine thing to do, as was done with the Lord of the Rings movies, but in doing so the essence of the story was missed. Often when writing a script, writers say that they try to write the movie that the story wants to become, and I don't think that was done in this case.There were a few problems I had with the writing and the plot. A lot of the dialogue was not ""fly on the wall"", particularly at the beginning. The ending was too dramatic in my opinion. It is not surprising that the writers decided to make it this way, but I thought that Jonas crossing the border just in time was more than the story needed. It detracted from the simplicity of the source material and really destroyed the ambiguity of whether Jonas and the Giver releasing all their memories of the past was the right thing. By making the dystopian government more oppressive, it pushed the argument too strongly in Jonas' favor. If Jonas/the writers had really wanted us to decide whether what he did was right, they would have emphasized the perfection of the community more and made the ending more painful. Now, by that I don't mean that they should have made those changes, but I just want to highlight the hypocrisy of letting the audience ""decide"". On a final story note, there was a glaring plot hole when Jonas and Fiona kiss. The cameras and loudspeaker had previously called them out immediately for touching and the leaders were later able to watch footage of the kiss, so by the rules of the world, Jonas should have been caught right then.There was a lot of work that went into the production design and visuals. It was noticeable, because of how the picture became more colorful as time went on and Jonas learned more. The memories that the Giver gave Jonas were very vibrant so as to glorify the life that we all have now. The sets for the community and for the Giver's house also seemed to be very deliberately made. On the whole, it seems that the people who had a hand in making the movie took pride in their work, which is heartening. I just wish that the writers, actors, and director assigned to the project had employed a bit more skill. Again, I get the sense that they put in a good effort, but it just turned out a little sloppy and childish. However, I don't want to blame the writers and directors too much, because I know they aren't always responsible for the poor aspects of the movies they make.The book follows the source material decently, but takes a few liberties. Personally, I felt that the deviations from the book made the movie worse, but others might say that the changes made it more dramatic and entertaining. If you like ""teen novels"" like Divergent, you'll probably enjoy this more than the book but not as much as more modern teen books. It is a feel-good movie, and hardly lives up to its PG-13 rating in terms of subject matter and intensity. On the whole, I did not like it, but that does not mean that you won't. Overall Rating: 4.7/10",The Giver

63,MovieHoliks,I Was Surprised I Enjoyed This...,7,4 August 2015,"I saw this movie off Showtime the other day, and while I wasn't all that terribly excited to see it, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this. Newcomer Brenton Thwaites (did I get that right?) stars in this futuristic drama about a utopian society where everyone is forced into a pattern of ""sameness"". Feelings have been shut down by a drug everyone takes, and all differences have been done away with in order to prevent jealousy, wars, etc.. The movie starts off in black and white, and then does the ""Pleasantville"" technique of turning into color gradually as our main character begins to feel things he's never experienced. I've read that this was somewhat of a pet project for Jeff Bridges (producer), who plays the titular role in this, and that he had originally (twenty years ago) planned on his old man, Lloyd Bridges, playing that role. Three-time (I think-??) Oscar winner, Meryl Streep, plays I guess what you could call the ""villainess"" role in this. And Alexander Skarsgard and Katie Holmes play our lead character's pseudo- parents. My only issue with this piece was- everything is going along fine, then it has to sorta evolve into this action-adventure movie. Why can't for once a sci-fi film just take the route of your serio-drama instead of always having to go for that ""Logan's Run""/""Soylent Green"" routine-?? But other than that, overall I liked this movie; I liked it's style, and the performances of it's stars. But one question I had- what accent exactly was Bridges going for-?? LOL",The Giver
64,abcvision,utopia,5,27 August 2014,"The Giver is based on a book and the premise is simple. In the future, the perfect paradise has been established. This utopia society has no color boundaries, everyone is content and courteous. No one has emotions and no one judges. All are chosen to their best traits to the path they will take in their lives that match their virtues. All is well until one member of the flock begins to question his role and that of society. This act of defiance begins a ripple that points to the cracks of this perfect world. At times this story is slow but the monotone performance makes you celebrate that you live in spectrum color and not simply white and black.",The Giver
65,LloydBayer,"For a film based on an original concept, The Giver is made twenty years too late and hence feels like an unwanted knockoff.",5,19 September 2014,"Based on a 1993 bestselling novel of the same name, The Giver is the latest sci-fi adventure aimed at a middle-school audience. While the film is visually arresting, it can only be fully appreciated by an audience with a high capacity to suspend reality.Stemming from novelist Lois Lowry's highly imaginative vision of the future, the story is set decades after society has been rebuilt following a total socio-political collapse. It is a purpose built utopia where citizens have no memories of the past. And because there are no memories of a time before theirs, there is no pain, no disease, no hunger, no malice, no rich or poor, and basically none of the social ills we see in the world today. Best of all, there is no colour, thereby eliminating racial and ethnic differences. It's an ideal society, but not perfect. Teenager Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) is the first to question strict laws imposed by the all-seeing, all-hearing council of Elders. As the protagonist, Jonas has an innate ability to see things differently, including flashes of colour in the world around him. This leads him on a quest to discover why his pristine society is void of deep emotions, last names and even biological parents. Things change for the worse when Jonas is elected as The Receiver of Memory, an assignment with great power but also greater responsibility.Taken under the wing of The Giver (Jeff Bridges), an Elder who holds historical memories as a sort of key between the past and the future, Jonas sees for the first time, the true beauty of civilization but also humanity's darker side – memories of love and laughter and various significant moments in human history but also visions of war, suffering and loss. The whole purpose is to guide Elders in times of conflict by avoiding mistakes made in the past. But what good is all this knowledge when there is no conflict at all? Turns out, there's always trouble if you go looking for it. Meryl Streep leads the charge as The Chief Elder, a polite but fascist matriarch, and out of nowhere Jonas faces peril for the first time, after falling in love with fellow citizen Fiona (Odeya Rush) and telling her how the world used to be. This is when we realize that this society is more dystopian than meets the eye. No surprise there, but it's at this point where you also start to ask a lot of questions arising from gaping holes in the story. Unfortunately, you won't find complete answers due to the shoddy screen adaptation. Still, one can only hope for more clarity in a sequel given that The Giver is adapted from a quartet.Most remembered for mid-90s espionage thrillers Patriot Games and its sequel, director Phillip Noyce appears to have his heart in the right place with crisp visualizations of Lowry's utopian society. It's a different matter when it comes to adapting Lowry's ideological musings on where utopia ends and dystopia begins. Another problem is how late in the game this film is considering its proximity to almost identical themes in Divergent and The Hunger Games. It's a pity because The Giver is sourced from archetype philosophy that probably inspired the conception of those films but its late production means it has missed the early boat to teen fantasy island. Then again, it's not all bad. Besides stunning visuals for a mostly monochromatic film and an uplifting musical score, Veterans Bridges and Streep hold it together on opposite ends of the rope. In between are some bland turn outs from Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes as Jonas' assigned 'Father' and 'Mother'. Thwaites is promising as the lead but as an upcoming actor, only a sequel will give him due recognition.While there is every reason to bash this film, I'd still give The Giver a chance purely due to its original concept, which in theory has vast potential to rise above its peers. Let's hope they don't wait another twenty years to make the sequel!",The Giver
66,shawneofthedead,"An ambitious adaptation of a difficult text, which tries but ultimately fails to find the troubled soul of its story.",4,20 August 2014,"Jeff Bridges has wanted to make a movie out of Lois Lowry's The Giver for years. It's easy to see why he had trouble doing so (the book is dense, philosophical and refuses to wrap things up in a neat package); it's also easy to see why Hollywood finally clambered on board (everyone wants their own mega-successful franchise - think The Hunger Games - based on a dystopian young-adult novel). The final film is an uncomfortable blend of big ideas and mass-market commercialism: the plot proceeds in broadly the same direction, but details small and large have been altered to make it palatable for as broad an audience as possible.Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) has grown up in a gentle, rule-bound society in which everyone is polite and amiable and individual differences are kept to a minimum. When he comes of age, he and his best friends Asher (Cameron Monaghan) and Fiona (Odeya Rush) nervously await the job assignments that will move them towards the next stage of their well-ordered lives. But Jonas receives the shock of his young life when the stern, steely Chief Elder (Meryl Streep) announces that he will take on the single most important job in the community. As the next Receiver of Memory, he will work with the incumbent Receiver - now more appropriately called the Giver (Jeff Bridges) - who will impart to him the memories, and possibly wisdom, that have long been lost to time and everyone Jonas has ever known.As a film, The Giver has a few things to recommend it. Though it loses much of the nuance of the novel, the complex ideas are still there. As Jonas peels away the cool, calm veneer of his old life, he comes to understand, appreciate and lament the sacrifices made to create the world in which he lives. The futuristic community is well-designed: people wander through a stainless-steel, white-washed network of modern buildings, clad in regulation clothing, clapping in unison with their left hands pounding their thighs. The use of colour - a key plot point within the book - is judiciously applied to Jonas' awakening consciousness: he literally sees new bursts of red and green and blue, his home and his friends fading from monochrome into sepia and, finally, falling headlong into a riot of colours.But the film never quite seems to settle into itself. Its more philosophical message is lost within the constant, confusing shifts in its storyline. At one moment, The Giver is a full-blown romance, as Jonas tries to save Fiona from the blinkered drudgery of his former existence. In the next breath, it's a thriller tainted by the villainous shadow of the Chief Elder, who watches Jonas' every move - with the help of his own mother (Katie Holmes) - to ensure that he doesn't become a threat to the community. Finally, it morphs awkwardly into an action movie, pitting friend against friend in a brave, if possibly foolish, bid for some kind of freedom.Fans of the book will know why the film plays out so strangely. Some of the changes made to the trajectory of Jonas' story are more understandable than others: for example, Jonas is aged up, from twelve to sixteen (which nevertheless requires the 25-year-old Thwaites to play a decade younger than his real age). Others changes become problems for the plot. In the novel, Jonas' romance with Fiona unfolds in hints and never develops into anything concrete. Similarly, the Chief Elder is more drone than tyrant, and barely registers as a presence in the book. Changing and beefing up both elements for the film creates a whole new set of contradictions. For instance, in a people shorn of genuine feelings, identity and memories, why does the Chief Elder behave in the way she does?Of the entire cast, Bridges finds the most to say and do with the Giver - a man bent in two and nearly broken by the weight of the burden he carries: a mix of memory and tragedy. For a more-or-less made-up character, Streep also finds a surprising depth to the seemingly odious actions of the Chief Elder. In the flicker of an eye or a twist of her lips, she hints at a history with the Giver in which choices were made and opportunities were lost. Thwaites fares less well: he carries the film dutifully, but plays his pivotal role without much in the way of depth or soul.That, in a sense, is the biggest problem with The Giver. It tells broadly the same story set out in Lowry's book, but seems to have missed the point of it all. Instead of allowing its powerful ideas to deepen and grow organically, the film bluntly lays them out, one after the other, and shoves them towards an ending that might never have been there to begin with. Lowry's book refused to give its readers any easy answers; the film, smart as it can be on occasion, too frequently feels as if it's been constructed wholly out of them.",The Giver
67,kermitkid,Respectful adaption,9,30 March 2020,"I'm pleasantly surprised that Hollywood chose to respect the source material instead of butchering it to the point where it's virtually unrecognizable as the same story. Jeff Bridges is the perfect choice to play The Giver! (In fact, when I read the book, I pictured him as Jeff Bridges. Apparently great minds think alike.) While it doesn't have nearly as much meat to the story as the book did it still gets the point of the story across. 1 hour and 30 minutes was a much shorter runtime than it should have been. They should have added at least another hour, and given more detail about the society in which the characters live. We're briefly given a list of their rules, but not enough detail as to how this society came to be. Some important parts were cut out of the movie or changed slightly, which is why you really must read the book first. However you can still understand most of it if you choose to see the movie before you read the book. While at times it does feel like it took inspiration from (read: stole) certain parts of the film adaptions of other YA novels such as ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent,"" keep in mind that the book of ""The Giver"" was written long before these other novels; it just took longer to make it. It's well worth the 20 year wait though, because this film adaptation is nearly perfect. It's probably the best book-to-film adaptation I've seen since the ""Harry Potter"" series. I'm hoping Jeff Bridges gets nominated for his role in this film, because he's absolutely phenomenal. And so is the film.

69,rollernerd,A world with no pain,5,18 September 2020,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the sci-fi flick based on the book, The Giver (2014), where everyone lives in peace due to not knowing or having emotional feelings therefore have no clue about war, pain, suffering, differences or choice - even pandemics 😉. Soon a young boy is chosen to learn from an elderly man about the true pain and pleasure of the ""real"" world. So the movie starts in a black and white style story where people are drugged in order to live in their equalitarian society and have no past memories of what may have transpired. There are established rules of politeness enforced by a council by the big brother style Elders and people must obey, which they do to a tea. Jonas, who already feels different from his peers, is appointed to a Receiver role during his graduation. He must be trained by the Giver, played by Jeff Bridges, where the Giver telepathically passes memories of the world before. Slowly and quickly Jonas learns emotions such as love, fear, excitement, loss and the concept of family. This does not do well with the Chief Elder, played by the queen herself Meryl Streep who discovers what may bring chaos to a civil society.So - the movie? It does have a good message both transpired with the sad score along with the dialogue by each actor which invites the idea around the thought of doing better and ensuring we are emotionally engaged both intelligently and humanely. Both Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep do well as expected however Bridges is my favourite with his gruff approach in his scenes where he shows his vulnerability and his mission to ensure change does occur. His sarcastic and straight to the point approach helps enhance the story more and gives the story more gravity. Jonas, played by Brenton Thwaites, does well and his chemistry with Bridges is fine however does overreact in some parts. I felt that this relationship between the two was rushed. Streep's character is not a typical evil character, she brings order and the notion of not making past mistakes which will bring hurt and turmoil to the current civil society. Her monotone expression is smart as it fits in with what the movie itself presents.The filmmakers are smart with the transition from black and white to colour scenes as it showed what the characters were able to see. The problems for me was the pacing - wayyyy too quick, felt way rushed. We know the reason why the elders choose to stick with the current new world order, but we don't hear it from them, nor do we know who they were in the past. Jonas rediscover the old natural world, no matter how beautiful and ugly it was, and contrast Instead of a good story we are fed more around the visuals and some set pieces and grand designs. Overall an average film, which had potential given the cast in the movie but instead CGI was invested more into the story of the film 5/10",The Giver
70,Emerenciano,Interesting film and very good cast. But we could have had more,6,12 January 2018,"First f all, watch this film!! It's worth trying and I'm sure most of people will like it. It's a chance to see Meryl Streep in another great performance and to enjoy Jeff Bridges's work as the the Giver of the title. The visual effects are other great features of this movie, as well as the beautiful sountrack. Don't miss ""The Giver"". However, I think this is the kind of film that could have been longer - it lasts less than 90 minutes - for we would like to see more of the story and its details. No, I'm not to give away much of the plot - you must have learnt about it by now - but I think some of the facts and facilities of community could have been more explored and explained.

Parents I think it is OK for the kids, but you are the parents so you get to decide if your kids see this or not. There are some parts that are a little scary, but still good at the sometime.

All these movies all end up seeming the same in the end.Other than Bridges fine performance, and an OK job from the teen star, the story is nothing special, and it really hurt to see someone like Meryl Streep just stink in her role.

73,nicolechan916,An intriguing story that had some interesting elements but fell short.,7,28 September 2014,"The whole utopian world did feel a bit overused, though did not have the same cliché effect that The Maze Runner had for me. And though there wasn't a maze or anything added to the world, it did have a sense of its own uniqueness.The acting was pretty all right, Thwaites got into the role of his character well and I sympathized with him. The other characters seemed too bland, though I guess that was the point. But as a film, the audience would want expressions and this was more than a lack of.The whole story behind this was pretty cool, I liked the humanity aspect of it. One thing though, about every dystopian story I know is based on humanity destroying itself before starting anew. Maybe there is some possibility that this might happen, but the fact that all of these stories are based on this is a bit troublesome.The effects were interesting and definitely unique as the majority of the film was in black and white. This definitely set it apart from the rest of its kind though the other sci-fi effects were moderately ordinary. They had pretty high-tech stuff and I feel like they didn't use them enough; the jets for one could have been incorporated more.Lastly, the ending was pretty predictable and felt a bit hanging. I'm not exactly sure what happened after the end or what the community turned into, so would have liked a bit of a closure scene.Read more of my reviews at championangels.wordpress.com.",The Giver
74,akash_sebastian,"It's an Intriguing Study of the Importance of Life, Emotions, and Choice.",7,17 October 2014,"Phillip Noyce's adaptation of Lois Lowry's 1993 book 'The Giver' is an intriguing study of the importance of life, emotions, and choice, and the different kinds of efforts we take to maintain peace. Compared to the other movie (of this year) that dealt with the same topic of futuristic world trying to maintain peace, 'Divergent', this one is shorter, and has better and new things to offer; suffice to say, it had its heart in the right place. It makes you think, what makes our life worth living?All the performances were commendable, but since the characters weren't developed much, they didn't have much to offer. Talented actors like Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges had very less screen-time, but for whatever scenes they had, they were quite captivating, especially Streep who has an amazing monologue towards the end.I liked the treatment of colours in the movie, like how everyone is the world sees only black & white, and as the Receiver starts gaining knowledge, he starts seeing colours, getting richer and richer with the knowledge he acquires. The background score accompanying them was mesmerizing too.The various compiled images of different places and emotions were quite beautiful and compelling. Overall, I felt the movie was quite rushed; the screenplay felt lazy enough not to linger and absorb at certain moments. With the grand themes it was handling, the characters and situations seemed in quite a hurry to reach their conclusions. The movie could have been longer.",The Giver
75,karlericsson,American propaganda,2,11 September 2014,"Let's not be shy about it: This Movie not only suggests that equality is bad, it propagates it. Now, before I loose myself in too many Words, let me just state this: Material inequality leads to the mental state of everybody chasing the same rabbit of material wealth, which makes everybody equal in mind and very dull indeed. Total material equality, however, puts an end to that chase and allows for everybody to venture on their own adventure not having to care about where there next meal is coming from. The work that needs to be done on this level of technical development, is about 4 hours a week and then you are free to do what you want except hurting or humiliating anyone. That's what total material equality means, not the gibberish propagated in this film. I gave it 2 stars and not one, because it still has a very weak suggestion that maybe there can be material equality without brain-wash, which, of course, is not only true but instead what material equality will certainly bring about if it is ever allowed to exist.For the most part however this film is the old scare of communism come alive again.

Production wise it's nicely done but the whole movie feels a bit tame and uninspired. Even class actors Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges fail to elevate this movie to a higher level.

77,huh_oh_i_c,"Actually, a strong argument for Security over Choice, albeit unwittingly.",7,19 October 2014,"At its core this is a movie with a very worn out theme of Ubertypical American-ness: Communism vs Capitalism (the latter is often inaccurately labeled as Democracy or Market Freedom). It's about the choice between strong, oppressive(?) community values versus individual choice. Absurdistic forms of 'sameness' have been explored in Kurt Vonneguts Harrison Bergeron, and in every movie with alien beehive societies, which are thinly veiled mockeries of communism. For example, the aliens in Starship Troopers and Battle Star Galactica.A more individual society, or one with strong communal values, well, both have their ups and downs. The world of the Giver is bland, but safe and secure. There's joy, happiness. People know what to expect. At the same time, there's little choice. Your job is state-assigned, but to be fair, it's what the person is most competent in.Our world is less secure, but we have choice and color. We also have much unhappiness and pain.It's a little like Northern Europe+Canada vs America. In America, the potential for wealth is theoretically at least stronger than in Europe, while the potential for poverty is very strong. In Europe, it's harder to get mega-rich, but it's not easy to be poor either. And what Americans are starting to realize is that while we're told that we can be a millionaire at any moment, it's not happening for 99.9 percent of Americans.If the question is asked ""would you give up security for freedom""? most liberals would think of the Patriot Act and say NO. But the Sameness world of the Giver is so peaceful and beautiful, even I as a liberal, am strongly inclined to like that world, because unlike the real world, the collective centralized government is functioning extremely well. The cheap shot that Lowry and the film take is the black and white gimmick. With that gimmick the film wants to drive home (with a ten foot baseball bat) that the Sameness society lacks in color and individuality, it's all black and white. That's pretty cheap.Conservatives are by definition quite hypocritical about all of this, they preach government hate, but don't mind abusing government to impose their values upon others, they will gladly use government to enforce vaginal probes (which is actually rape) in Virginia. They will sell this movie as the ultimate argument against ""communism"" but strongly support the communism that still exists in Utah. There's no real difference in oppressive social controls via religion or via the state. For all intents and purposes, rank breaking Mormons will pay a high price to be different, and the same goes for every so-called Christian town/state. Mormons can't really leave their church, because they have strong business ties to their community.While this is a decently made movie with good acting, pretty actors, and nice graphics, I find that the message of the movie is flawed because of the easy potshots it takes on the Sameness world: ""Oooooh, a highly government run worlds will lead to a bland, grey-ish society where everything is in black & white.The Melancholic Alcoholic.",The Giver

The trailer seemed interesting, and there's a couple good actors that made me think this could be a good movie. I was wrong. The story is so cliché based that makes me wonder how or why all this directors and writers even got into film making. Really, what's the point of doing a movie or a script over and over again, and even worst that it was made before. The story is boring, and the general design is terrible. The scenarios, the vestry... no imagination was the main (and huge) problem with this and many movies lately. It's another desperate attempt of taking the place as the new teenager movie series to earn millions. The actors were good in their parts, but the parts were bad. Seemed interesting the fact of colours in the photography, on the beginning, but wasn't more than a detail that didn't really made any difference for me.Good acting, poor story and script, fair photography, very poor costume and scenery designs.

The Giver is directed by Philip Noyce and stars Jeff Bridges, Brenton Thwaites and Meryl Streep. It's based on a popular book written by Lois Lowry. Firstly the trailer doesn't do any justice to the movie. It's an interesting movie with a lot portion of captivating scenes. This film kept me captivated on characters and what was going on. The first act is a little bit boring though, as every character has no emotion and no singularity. Except for Jeff Bridges' character. In fact, the scenes where young Jonas visits the giver and they learn about the past are when the film really picked up and has actually some really beautiful themes going throughout. Though those themes are very heavy headed regards to biblical messages, apples, trees and search for knowledge whether you're trying to figure out what sin is or evil. However, Brenton Thwaites is an interesting young talent and very good in this film. Jeff Bridges is also fantastic, you can really tell that he is invested heart and soul in this project. He's the only character we can imagine a past life. Those type of movie characters are very interesting as you have to try to imagine their life beyond the movie. Still Meryl Streep doesn't ad much to the movie.

It's the first movie of this sub-genre that came up and I really like.First, despite most of sci-fi movies, it has an almost absence of violence. I really like that, and that's a positive thing to teach teens to peace.Has a curious, unexpected plot, really good effects, and like the whole Black/white to colour metamorphsis we have in the movie.For who didn't notice, we have Jeff Bridges (Iron Man, Tron: Legacy) and Katie Holmes (batman Begins) in the cast.Overall, giving this a 6/10 because despite it's greatness it has a few plot-leaks at the end, and it's still not as good as many films I've seen.",The Giver

Well, Gattaca didn't rely on huge action and big effects even though the futuristic setting was a big part of it. It relied on character and story which made it one of the nicer gems of the 90's.The Giver is the same. It relies on a classic story which the novel was and shows us more character than action. The plot follows what seems like a Utopian society with all old memories erased with our hero Jonas who is friends with Fiona and Asher. It is the end of their childhood and at a ceremony, Jonas is given the job of Receiver of Memory which is the most important job in the world. As The Giver gives him more memories, he starts thinking differently as he doesn't take his medication and starts breaking rules of the society. Its up to Jonas to show the community what they need to know.Surprisingly, the movie looks really cheap. Maybe its because 25 million dollars was put into this. Even Gattaca looked more expensive! But enough of that. The movie is spectacular at narrative. Color is a huge metaphor in this movie. It starts out in black and white and as Jonas gets memories, color starts to take over. There is more black and white, but it is more pale. This is one of the best uses of Color I have seen in a movie. Color nowadays is the regular format for film. But Color here is used for art. Director Phillip Noyce knew how to surprise audiences with this. All the actors did a great job all around, the story is still interesting to follow for a 21 year old book and I wish it would do better at the box office because this film is really good.But... the ending had lots of plot holes I felt. OK. So Jonas breaks the barrier of memory and everything turns into color and everything is well. But they don't have an epilogue. Do the other elders go against the Chief Elder? Does the chief elder change in the end? Does she stay the same? Is she punished if they side against her? Do they just go on as life happens, do they celebrate? WHAT HAPPENS?! We never know. It just ends on the same shot of one of the first memories. If they ever do release a directors cut, I would love to have more clarification of what happens to the Community.But even with that one big flaw, this movie really delivers. It is impressive that it holds back on action, its impressive how they use Color as a Metaphor, its all out impressive. Go see this movie right now before the film gets on Blu Ray/DVD. If you don't, support the film on DVD/Blu Ray! It really is worth it and should have a bigger following. 88/100 B+",The Giver
82,rprince-832-6294,Recycled plots put to good use!,6,25 October 2014,"-The Giver is a film based on a novel that I have not read, so I am judging the FILM! Anyway, The Giver is a film about a young adult in a dystopian future who struggles against the constricting hierarchy after being chosen for something more than ordinary, kinda like Divergent. He begins to train with this Giver who teaches him that society is being suppressed and emotion and human feeling exists . Kinda like Equilibrium.-As cliché and predictable as this film is, I liked it. It even featured the whole black-and-white premise so the lead can start to see color as he becomes more human . Like from Pleasantville. I will say though, that if you are going to reuse a bunch of recycled materials, might as well make it good and entertaining, which this totally is! -The tone is just how it sounds above. The pace is good and the story still feels kinda fresh for a cliché.-The acting is good, but nobody is great. Jeff Bridges did really well. I also really don't like Meryl Streep. Nothing against the film, I just don't like her acting. Idk.-The really liked the music and the visual appeal of the film. And I really liked the finally and ending! -It also delves into some deep themes that I criticized Snowpiercer for, but I am applauding The Giver for, as well as some positive themes about hope and humanity.-Aaaand that's really all I have to say about it. Oh, it's PG-13 and has almost no objectionable content.-So The Giver is a bunch of recycled plots and elements from other films put together with some good acting and a fresh feel to it to make it a good film overall. I would buy The Giver in a $5 bin, so I will give it a solid 7/10! (Which is higher than I thought I would)",The Giver

Wow!!! this movie showed so many moral and spiritual elements and it showed about love and hope. The acting was so so great and i loved it!!! it was so entertaining and i am like obsessed! :) I wish their was more to Jonas's story in the books...but that only comes later on in like the third or 4th book in the series. Wow...i wasn't expecting it to touch on such heavy subject...but they did it so well. this is a movie that teens and young adults should see and families should see it together. it made me be grateful to be alive and to live in this beautiful and chaotic world.",The Giver
84,TheFilmGuy1,Go See Divergent Or Hunger Games Instead,5,20 August 2014,"This is a movie that has some really interesting concepts, and could have actually been a beautiful and super powerful film. But sadly, since films based on young adult novels these days have to appeal to young audiences, they really make it unoriginal. It seems to pick up a lot from films such as the Hunger Games, The Host or Divergent, which i'm not sure if those things were in the novel or not, but it still feels unoriginal. Even the visuals are a copy of the things we see in other young adult distopian/utopian films.The story contains a mixed bag of interesting, though provoking stuff, and ideas that have already been explored in other films before. I found myself occasionally thinking ""oh, this could be interesting"" but it ends up not delivering. I think in the hands of a director who focuses less on the CGI and more on the acting and message, this film could have rocked. There's a strong message there, but it's buried under silly stuff.The acting here is rough. Jeff Bridges gives the only good performance. You could feel the pressure on his characters shoulders and it worked. Everyone else was just... bad. I'm not sure if it was perhaps because of the fact that they are supposed to be living in a world where emotions are suppressed, but it just didn't work. Everybody was awkward and it felt like amateur hour. Even Meryl Streep was weak. It was certainly disappointing and it really brought the film down. Overall I just wouldn't recommend this. Go watch The Hunger Games, or hell, even watch Divergent, which I thought was disappointing but at least has some potential with future sequels. This one just has nothing to warrant a watch, and it really sucks because it could have been something great.",The Giver
85,ZeroCoolRO,"I dont think that I gave spoilers, but still YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!",10,18 August 2021,"Imagine living in a world where you are actually an mindless drone, a prisoner. Because trust me, those humans that lived in that world were not free humans, they couldnt do anything without the accept of some elders. They had lots of rules, and most of them were very stupid, but still they respected them. They were never curious why they dont have free will ... and im saying this because for example, if you would like to do something different like holding hands with a friend, was forbidden, why no one was like ""hey why i cant hold hands, why i cant kiss the girl that i like for example, why is this forbidden?""Jonas asked his father a simple question: ""Father do you love me?"" and his mom immediately said same stupid line ""Jonas precision of language, please"" .. so as I said, MINDLESS DRONES! They don't know what is hate, what is love, what is real happiness... they dont freakin see colors because of that ""sameness"" or how the hell was called.They were spied by that old lady everywhere.. inside their so called homes, spied outside, spied at work.. everywhere, even in that triangle thing, even there was some camera that showed what they do inside. They were under surveillance non stop, no privacy... that world they lived in was a prison.But, over all the movie was amazing, really loved it. The ending was good, but I feel like something is still missing.

86,ScoobySnacks66,Worth a watch in a crowded YA sci-fi field,7,20 May 2019,"The film starts with cool black and white cinematography and quickly hooks us into wondering what's going on in this slick utopia. Obviously strongly inspired by Aldous Huxley's work, it's not the most original film (adapted by a young adult sci-fi novel which I admit I've never read) but it is much better than a lot of the others out there today that lack some of the stronger social, political and humanism themes I enjoyed exploring in this film. As the conflict and drama start to take hold, the allegory begins feeling glib and the ending a bit rushed for the heaviness of the subject matter. I'm giving this Brave New World knock-off a 7/10 for good acting, beautiful sets and cinematography, and an interesting take on colour design and it's association to human feelings and passion.",The Giver

88,eschetic-2,Solid philosophical science fiction for the Elementary School set,7,17 August 2014,"Gifted with excellent production design and top flight star casting, the only thing really wrong with this eminently watchable dissection of a prototypical dystopian society is the overwhelming sense of ""de ja vu"" it carries with it for all those who have seen the many recent films on the same topic.When viewing the trailers for director Phillip Noyce's mini-epic (a mere 94 minutes, feeling far shorter) I remarked to my friends how much it sounded like yet another go-round of the story twice told already recently in THE HUNGER GAMES and DIVERGENT, only to be told that the ""young adult"" novel by Lois Lowry (inspired, according to a recent interview, by growing up on the bland ""sameness"" of an army base across a wall from the dazzlingly colorful Tokyo!) actually got there first - even if the Harry Potter-like success of the copies on page and screen are only now inspiring a big screen version of the original. HAD it come first, I suspect my rating would have been several stars higher, because the story telling, cinematography and acting are hard to fault but for the original now resembling a fairly pale copy.Of course the core story, while laying out the classic dilemma of all attempted ""utopian"" societies, that the trade-offs for security and stability, of necessity, involve things most people regard as essential. The idea goes all the way back to Ben Franklin's pronouncement that ""Those who would trade liberty for security deserve neither"" . . . if not the Garden of Eden. ...but in this telling, the dilemma doesn't bear serious thought even five minutes after the credits roll. In addition to banning all emotion and even literal COLORS in this post-apocalyptic world, they obviously have had to ban all entertainment (old movies) as well. If you're over 15, 30 seconds after the film's first reference to the elderly or rebels being ""released to 'Elsewhere'"" you'll be screaming ""Soylent Green is people!"" It's that basic de ja vu problem, only with a longer frame of reference.If you're UNDER 15, or have precocious pre-teens, I do recommend the film as a good introduction to the ideas contained. The leads, from Australian newcomer Brenton Thwaites as the new ""Receiver"" for the Giver's trove of memories to grand dame Meryl Streep as the chief elder of the repressive society (is she trying for a more accessible evil female version of Richard Nixon or does she really believe what she says? The subtle distinction makes it a great performance and she even manages a layered complexity to the final resolution of the the film's story - does she see the error of her ways or not!?) and Jeff Bridges in the title role (made up to look as much like Stephen Sondheim as humanly possible - a great touch for a collector and transmitter of collective wisdom) could hardly be improved upon, and the canny casting of minor roles (Taylor Swift as an earlier failed candidate to replace Bridges and Alexander Skarsgård as the blissfully bland ""father figure"" for the lead, brainwashed into horrible actions) adds immeasurably to the way the film holds the interest and gets its points across.The only real failing (and it is a relatively minor failing) in the film, taken on its own terms, is the colorful but extremely generic film montages as Bridges pours the societal memories into Thwaites (in some kind of ESP downloading we are generally willing to suspend disbelief for). It's just that the montages are painfully generic and unimaginative - the rest of the film is far better crafted.At the same time, as the half full Sunday matinée audience (mostly in their mid-teens) I saw the film with today (17 Aug 14) was filing out of the theatre, the muted comments were about evenly divided between whining that ""there really wasn't much plot"" (I was impressed with their sophistication - there really wasn't) and quiet enthusiasm for the slightly larger than cameo performance from Taylor Swift (also well deserved). I was only a little surprised no one mentioned what a great performance Noyce got out of the unbilled babies Alexander Jillings, James Jillings, Jordan Nicholas and Saige Fernandes as ""Gabriel"" (ages 6 to 12 months)! If it's still possible, see this elementary level look at dystopia before any of the HUNGER GAMES films or DIVERGENT series, but if you already HAVE already bought into those, expect something a lot less fully developed, but equally serious and surprisingly enjoyable. I liked it, but wished there were more to it. If your local elementary school or Sunday school class wants a literate special event for the Elementary School set, this GIVER would be an unusually good bet . . . and, for heavens' sake, don't let their older brothers and sisters turn up their noses at something too ""juvenile"" for them! Point out the great cast which makes even this elementary examination of the classic topic fit for adults. How many other recent films can you honestly say that about?",The Giver
89,macpet49-1,Sophie's Afterbirth,3,17 June 2016,"One in a long line of boring films about the future. A combination of 'Logan's Run' and any of several old 60s 'Star Trek' TV episodes with a dash of 'The Prisoner' thrown in. Meryl plays the evil 'Number One' who knows and decides things for the Committee who runs the communities. ('They shoot babies, don't they?'-no offense to Jane Fonda) She's looking a lot like a tall, thin old Bette Davis with a severe hag haircut. Her opposite is a now withered Jeff Bridges (inc. raspy frail voice box) who cannot wait to do his piano solo so the world once again knows he is musical (shades of 'Who's Got Talent?'). He wants to set the people free to bring back all the extreme emotions and animal urges that made us destroyers of ourselves and the planet and she wants to keep the lid on the genie. Guess who wins? The hero is a young model type boy the camera adores (with twinkling eyes, pearly perfect whites, gorgeous hair). He reacts rather than acts. The other young stars are just forgettable. There is an underlying theme of 'Just walk into the light'. It's quasi religious, hetero to the extreme, filled with babies and boring as hell. Glad I didn't have to pay to be annoyed. Hollywood should really stop making movies. Ripoffs all!",The Giver
90,crosswalkx,This Giver movie was awful I want a Giver movie remake.,1,1 September 2014,"Hello as you know I've read the book The Giver by Lois Lowry back when I was in High School. This was one of Walden Medias crummy adaption. Walden Medias Narnia 1,2,3 movies was much better than this boring movie. Of course they altered Susan Coopers The Dark is Rising book. But seriously this movie doesn't do the book justice. For those IMDb users who say who liked the Giver movie, I disagree with you completely. I want to point out the major changes made to the book.Why is the instrumental music soundtrack present throughout the movie? Where was the scene where the airplane accidentally flew too low and the pilot gets released? Why are the buildings in weird shapes and why is there the Triangle symbol? Why is the community built on a mountaintop and where's the river? Why are there hologram projectors and computer screens featured in the movie? Where was Jonas school and why is Jonas Fiona, Asher older teenagers instead of 12? Where's the conversation where Lily gets a little angry and makes a fist about the boy at the playground? Why is Jonas and Fiona and Asher hanging out in the triangle hedges with the waterfall door? Since when did Jonas fall in love with Fiona? Where's the scene where Jonas plays catch the apple and briefly sees the color red? Where's the house of the old people where Fiona gives the old man and Jonas gives the old woman Larissa a bath? Why isn't Lily wearing her hair ribbons? Why is the Ceremony cut short and since when did Asher become a drone pilot? Why isn't Asher a recreation director? Where's the scene where they talk about Ashers childhood with Asher saying ""I want my Smack."" instead of Snack and getting his legs whipped for it? Why is Lily 9 instead of 8 and since when did she receive her bike? Why is Jonas number 52 instead of 19? Why didn't Jonas see the color in the audience faces? Where's the lunch scene where Jonas eats lunch with his friends during break time? Where is Pierre and Issac? Why is Fiona a caretaker of babies instead of elderly people? Why is the Chief elder woman constantly spying on The old Man Giver instead of giving Jonas and Giver privacy? Since when did Jonas give Fiona a sled ride on the Escalator arch. Why isn't Jonas laying face down when he receives memories from the Givers hands? Why isn't Caleb 4 years old mentioned about falling in the river and drowning?Where are the memories not featured in the movie? Jonas feeling sunshine, and Sunburn. Jonas sledding out of control on the icy hill and getting hurt. The memory of rainbow colors. What happened to the war scene with the horses getting killed and the boy begging for water? Since when did the Giver and Rosemary play piano? Why is the Giver giving Jonas music with the wedding scene? Where's the room where the families are celebrating Christmas and opening presents?Why didn't the Giver tell Jonas that people know nothing about life? Why are Jonas friends playing war with a ball instead of imagining and acting it out? Where are the Memories of Rosemary experience with picnics, merry go rounds with poverty, child being alone and starvation? Why didn't the Giver tell Jonas ""You stay away from the river."" Why is the video of the baby twins with Jonas Father fast forward the whole time? And why isn't Jonas talking and getting upset at the killing the baby twin? Why didn't Jonas get upset and criticize the speaker attendants job and then stay for a night at the Givers Place? Why is the baby Gabriel over at the hospital instead of at Jonas house. Where's the scene where Jonas plans his escape with the Giver and then finding out he no longer had color and refusing to accept music. Since when did Fiona help Jonas get the baby Gabriel and help him escape and why is the alarm sounding with the police chasing after Jonas on a motorbikes? Since when did both the Giver and Fiona get arrested and then being put on death row? In the book Jonas took Gabriel from his home quietly stole the meals and rode a regular bike. Since when did Asher confront Jonas on his bike and get punched by him. Also why was Asher hunting with a hover drone talking to Jonas using a video phone? Also why did Asher pick Jonas up and dropped him in the river? In the book the planes were searching for days using heat seekers to find Jonas and Gabriel and they made themselves cold. Why is Fiona and The Giver about to be executed? Why is Jonas in the desert and carried off the river instead of hunting in the Forest? Jonas didn't get to hear music until he and Caleb arrived elsewhere coming downhill on the sled and they arrived at a town instead of a log cabin.With all of the major changes I've noticed in the movie some things were done right and the memories but the acting was pretty boring just like The Last Airbender. The music should not have been in the movie until the very end. I feel sorry for Lois Lowry for the Hollywood people taking advantage of her work. This is the most forgettable movie I've ever seen and I'm insulted and upset by the changes Walden Media decided to do.I can't wait for The Giver movie remake even if it's a fan fiction cartoon video.",The Giver

I'm not quite sure what to think. This one blew me away. Not for it's awesomeness, but for the way it surprised me. I was expecting a mix of the typical fanfare, The Hunger Games mixed with The Maze mixed with Ender's Game, mixed with Coyboys and Aliens ad nauseum. And yet, fascinatingly, this was none of these. It was in fact an utterly disparate abyss of nothing, and in this way it remind me of Seinfeld: ""A show about nothing."" You see, bad movies, and I do mean campy bad B movies, tend to become better and better the higher one is (think of the classics, think Evil Dead 2). Not so with this contrived and worthless turd- athon. What was Jeff Bridges thinking? What was Meryl Streep thinking? Do they even read the script before signing on?

92,andymhancock,"Not Oscar material, but pretty good",7,4 April 2019,"I'm ambivalent about reviews that pan a movie by comparing it with the book. I see a movie rating as an assessment of the movie, period. If one wanted to conduct a comparative study, that needs a separate metric because it conveys different information. If you start mixing ratings that assess the movie on its own with ratings that compare the movie with the book, then the rating becomes less meaningful because, again, they measure different things.The movie was quite good. Not spectacular, but I like the way they started corny, then revealed the gravity of the societal problems with time. In particular, the seriousness of the things that were so blithely referred to at the start. The old guy was melodramatic at times. I think that there is enough argumentation for both sides of how humans should live to give people pause about whether one way is that much better than the other. That's a good thing.Having said that, there are loopholes that a truck can be driven through. They require no description, as the viewer will automatically ask themselves ""why does doing such-and-such cause thingy-thing to happen?

(Answer- Every bloody teen movie set in the future that has come out since a movie studio capitalized big time on first Hunger Games franchise). Now every studio was a slice of the future teeny pie. The Giver is a good but predictable story line set in a future where everyone is assigned a task at a given age and represses emotions. As predicted the protagonist gets the best gift but finds out it is a mixed blessing and that there are more wonderful things than living in black and white like green trees and blue sky........so things go as he discovers everyone one is repressed and starts a rebellion of sorts. Friendships are tested, love is found and future leaders with numerous resources at their disposal like all others in future teeny movies seem incapable to stop the lone teen renegade.Ultimately the story is a little fresh but really just follows the story of all other future teeny movies......Next.",The Giver

97,YJLcool,A thought-provoking sci-fi film that came out late,7,8 September 2014,"Have you ever dreamed of a perfect world, where there's no racial, ethnic, religious, political conflicts, no violence, no war, no hunger, no pain, no suffering, no tragedy? A world where everything that is needed are all provided for you and no one wants more for anything? I believe that this is the world we all yearn for. What if we could achieve this just by forsaking our feelings, our emotions, our free will and individuality? Is it worth it to deny the extraordinary diversity of human experience, for the sake of peace? This is the premise of The Giver. It's interesting, intelligent, intriguing and thought-provoking at the same time.Based on the 1993 novel of same name written by Lois Lowry (keep in mind that The Hunger Games is written in 2008 and Divergent is written in 2011, so it is suffice to say that these books are inspired by this particular novel), it's a story about a boy named Jonas who lives in a seemingly 'perfect' world after the collapse of mankind, where everyone is the same and they all strictly adhere to a set of societal rules established by the elders: everyone is assigned to a more compatible family unit to prevent unnecessary conflicts; teenagers who graduated from school are assigned suitable jobs according to their personality traits; (feels familiar?) language needs to be spoken 'precisely' and any words that indicate negativity needs to be questioned and addressed; you must apologise for any mistakes you've made and your apology must be accepted as well; lying is not permitted; emotions are heavily suppressed by taking daily injection of drugs and memories of the past are taken away to prevent history from repeating itself.There's only one person in the community, the Giver of memories, who holds all the memories of the past, to provide the wisdom he needs to advise the elders when the time comes. Jonas is chosen to be the Receiver of memories. As Jonas begins his 'training' with the Giver, he slowly learns about pain, sadness, anger, fear, loneliness, violence, war, death...but also compassion, mercy, benevolence, warmth, happiness, love, family, life...Through these 'trainings', he discovers the importance of choice, the wonders of experience, the joy of life and understands what it meant to be living.The film made its point rather clear in the beginning, by portraying the world in black and white as the community do not perceive colour at all. Most audience might find the first half of the film to be boring and dull, but this is exactly how it should feel like. The absence of colour shows the absence of diversity, emotions, knowledge. Without them, we're nothing but an empty shell. As Jonas starts to feel more emotions, we slowly get to see the colours...the beauty of the world from his perspectives.The film explores the fundamental issues about human nature in depth, which was beautifully captured in various shots and montages in the film. Yes, the world could be a better place if everyone acts and behave the same as the rest, but is there a point for doing that? Is submission to social conformity truly the right thing to do? Without feelings and emotions, can we truly say that we are alive? Human nature is fundamentally flawed. It is undeniably true that human greed, ignorance, lust for power and selfishness destroy and hinder us from creating a heaven on Earth, but there's also a hidden potential for good in humanity...there's love, friendship, compassion, mercy, wisdom, humility, benevolence. When there's love, there's hatred. When there's order, there's chaos. When there's life, there's death...As we witness death, we experience pain and loss, these feelings and emotions validates our love for one another, it also allows us to appreciate the time we have and the life we've been given. They're all and one. They come in one 'package'.The film also points out that it is the search for truth that truly liberates us and gives us real freedom, not hiding from it (Ignorance). In the film, you can see the look of amazement on Jonas' face as he sees the snow, animals, hears various music and dances, beautiful sunset for the first time. Most notably, his newfound love for Fiona, compassion for the baby Gabriel and finally his decision to give the people back their freedom to feel and to choose. We can also see his struggles, his sadness and frustrations when he learns about the darker side of human nature. We can see that Brenton Thwaites and Jeff Bridges both provided a decent performance to carry the film and successfully deliver the novel's core messages well. Meryl Streep done what she could for for her rather limited role as the Chief Elder. Taylor Swift's cameo appearance was rather surprising as well. It's rather unfortunate that it needs the success of two immensely popular book series (The Hunger Games and Divergent) to greenlight this film. As a result, it feels all too familiar and it does give the feeling that we have all seen this before. It's such a shame.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/09/movie-review-giver.html Rating: 7.5/10",The Giver
98,moviescoundrel,A so so adaptation,7,25 September 2014,"It is difficult to put my finger on why this movie was not great, because it definitely was not. The cast was not revolutionary (leads were new), the plot waswell predictable based on the book, but the adaptation and suspense created were pretty bland. It has been quite awhile since I've read the novel, but I know things are somewhat close to the book. There are of course some creative liberties here present, but in my mind, nothing too crazy, and maybe nothing too crazy enough. Something here is missing. I didn't really care that much about the main character. I found myself watching the story unfold, but without a lot of angst or empathy for the main characters. I think the interaction with the giver had some potential that was not tapped into as well as the family's dynamic and also the relationship between the community leaders and the giver. Just so much untapped potential. What is here is not awful mind you, it's just nothing worth writing home about.

The acting is fantastic, highlighted by Bridges, Streep, and Thwaites, who perfectly bring their respective characters to life. Emotionally the film is bright, ironically while presenting a landscape unseen to emotion. The dialogue assists the depth of the film, with meaningful words that heavily impact nearly every scene, and develop characters solidly. There are some holes, or rather potentially a few missing scenes that could give a further explanation to some plot points, but this is mostly negligible due to the smooth flow that the movie has.

When you feel happiness and you smile, when you feel sadness and you cry, do that make this movie a bad movie. I am not questioning you, I am simply telling you that when we watch this movie, we watch not only for the plot it provides with all its twists and turns, but we also watch to feel emotions. That is simply why we enjoy watching movies. We watch movies to experience the human experience of happiness and sadness that connects us to who we are as a species. We are not only blessed with the ability to think, but also with the ability to feel emotions. When you watch this movie open your heart to it and Let yourselves dive in an experience of what makes us humans!!! Just feel, that's all I ask and you will soon find out what a relief it is to laugh and cry. Watch this movie and do not listen to those who keeps telling you to be machines. A machine can think like us but it can never be human cause what truly makes us special, what truly may unite us as a species is our connection to what is human about us: emotions.",The Giver
103,russellingreviews,Adding technicolour to a monochromatic world,7,19 November 2014,"Love, hope and joy are central themes of the book, but will this film convey the same message? Walking into the cinema... The dystopian, young adult fiction genre is getting a bit tired. It is understandable that film makers are trying capitalise on the Twilight and Hunger Games successes. The challenge for these films is finding an original theme. The Giver seems to be putting forward a different storyline and it includes Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep. Does it have hope for some originality?Cinematic value: 3.5 stars Family value: 3 stars Overall rating: 3.25You have to ask, 'Do we need another dystopian, young adult drama?' After Twilight, The Hunger Games and Divergent, it feels like this genre has hit its maximum capacity. Genre fatigue will be a major hurdle for The Giver, which was written prior to the other book series, but took some time to get released and, surprisingly, does give a new spin to this worn out genre. After reading the book, I understand why some fans would be upset by the changes, but they were needed to appeal to a broader audience and makes the film worth considering. Phillip Noyce (Salt) manages to lay out a monochrome setting for the setting of the film in the utopian Community. A society that has eliminated war, pain and suffering, but there is something missing in this seemingly perfect society. Noyce seems to be preparing the film's artistic canvas before adding the desired colours. As with most artists, he begins by drawing a monochrome picture before starting work on his cinematic work. After the establishment of black and white portrayal of the community, we are introduced to a special ceremony for young graduates and their roles in the society. The central character, Jonas (Brenton Thwaites), is given the unique role of Receiver of Memories, a position that has not been given to anyone in 10 years. He enters into training with a mysterious elder called The Giver (Jeff Bridges). The development of their relationship is the basis for the slow incorporation of colour into the palette of the society and on the screen. With the introduction of the realities of the truths of the ""real"" world, Jonas finds that things are not as they seem within this utopian community. The richness of life brings forth the technicolour that he had realised was missing from The Community and his life. The beauty of the story is like watching a painting slowly come into reality. Jonas has to make decisions about what to do with these new truths. The story does not have children killing or fighting other children and does not incorporate too many action sequences. It is more philosophical and provokes the bigger questions of life. Jeff Bridges as the brooding mentor, helps to convey the weight of responsibility of one who holds the truths of the society, but has to have restraint in sharing with the broader society. Once he is allowed to share with Jonas, he has difficulty with the pace of release of information and pushes Jonas into making decisions that will effect all of the controlled society. The experience is like watching a colour by number painting being painted by Jackson Pollack. Philip Noyce manages to take a worn out genre and broaden the perspective of the viewer. The black and white filming is intentionally unnerving until the colour of the story and Jonas' life come into focus. The colours play beautifully against the backdrop of the greys of a society left without love and hope. One of the refreshing components of the storyline is how it pushes against the boundaries of political correctness and some of the key failures of humanity. Noyce manages to paint a picture of the realities of society and the awareness of what adds to the beauty to life. Admittedly, the film has an Oblivion and Enders Game feel without the action sequences and will inevitably suffer from comparison to many of the dystopian films that have come before and because of the lack of action it will not appeal to some of the audience of the The Hunger Games. Yet, due to the thought provoking message of life makes attending this film worthwhile for adults and teens. This recommendation comes with a warning. There are scenes of infanticide and references to euthanasia that are unnerving for the characters of the film and for the audience. Noyce does not take the topic lightly and does help to promote the sanctity of life. These crimes on humanity, the philosophical nature of the film, and the lethargic pacing will cause unfair comparisons to other series within this genre of film. It is thought provoking and refreshing, but does cover some disturbing content. The Giver is not a masterpiece, but it does have an aesthetic appeal and philosophical value. Leaving the cinema... The last expectation of this film was to have deep theological and philosophical discussions with my young adult children, but that is what ensued. In amongst the young adult drama was the discussion of life, love, hope and joy. It had significant changes to the book, but necessary for a more mature audience. This film will have to get over the hurdle of genre fatigue, but commendations have to go to the screenwriters for their bravery and originality and I would recommend The Giver. What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does God and the Bible have to say about the value of life? (Genesis 1:27, Isaiah 46:3-4) 2. Do we have a role in our society? (John 13:35, 1 Peter 2:17) 3. Where can we find real love, hope and joy in this broken world?

105,xpunisherx,The ultimate feel good movie,9,16 January 2021,So the storyline itself is a complete mirror of divergent. I don't know which one came first so I won't say copy. However it's full of emotion and feel good moments that make you realize how great life is. If you like feel good movies you should watch this.,The Giver
106,bonniejoy-978-68763,Hollywood vs Lowry,5,9 December 2016,"I read the book in eighth grade and loved it more than I thought I would. It was basically about a 12 year old boy named Jonas who gets assigned to be the Receiver of Memory. In the new job, he understands everything that the community he lives in, tried to block out, such as deep emotions, color, smell, music, and so on. Through this job, he discovers how his world was not as perfect as he and his community always supposed.While reading the story, I kept thinking ""Hollywood would do a great job with this story."" However, when the trailers did come out, fans of the book (including myself) cringed at the amount of color shoved onto the community, the romance, Jonas' age change to 16, the way the giver himself transfers memories to Jonas, and how Jonas gets caught by a search plane. It seemed like the directors were deliberately going against the book's design. Although, when I finally saw the movie, I found myself conflicted a bit. The problems I have with the movie are many, such as: why make them teens? There's a reason why Jonas and his friends were grown up at 12 and not 16. It was because that was the early age of puberty and everything that came with it had to be gone. At 16, they're past it and it doesn't make as much sense. It's like the directors were trying to make it marketable by making the main characters high schoolers. Also, in the book, though everyone but Jonas lacked deep emotion (like joy or depression) they were still likable and made you feel sorry that they couldn't understand Jonas when it came to love, pain, or joy. Here, they're all sticks in the mud, even Jonas' best friend, Asher, who was basically the funniest guy, but now all that humor's given to Jonas. This all ends up making the community rather hostile, which they're not suppose to be. This isn't the Hunger Games where emotions are intentionally stolen and the community leader is an antagonist, this is The Giver where Jonas is learning about hard emotions and memories, and seeing that the community legitimately tried to create a utopia freed from hate, heartbreak, racism, religion, pain, difficult weather, and all the world issues we suffer today. But he also sees why this kind of utopia can't exist if we are to survive. To be fair to the movie, there are some good elements. Of course Jeff Bridges as the Giver is spot on casting, and I can't think of anybody better to play the lonely, frustrated, and occasionally amusing character. Also, Jonas, though very bland in the movie, does shine when showing his curiosity about the lost memories. And even though the trailers marketed the movie to be technicolor, the color only comes in when Jonas is ""seeing beyond"" and the effects are what I always imagined in the story when reading it. Also, everyone keeps up the rules of the book such as precision of language, Ceremony for the 12's, accepting apologies, and release. Also, kudos for making Taylor Swift unrecognizable. She plays a minor character and doesn't stand out more than the main characters. In my book, that's 5 points in this movie's favor. To be fair, this is a hard story to adapt to film, and I give the directors credit for trying at least, even if it didn't quite work out. I heard that the author Lois Lowry backs this up, but I have trouble seeing that in this film. Technically, it's not a faithful adaptation, and as a stand alone movie, it almost seems like a boring Hunger Games wannabe.",The Giver
107,stuart_davies,"Definitely worth a watch. Better than Convergent, worse than 1984.",7,15 September 2014,"Didn't know what to expect from the story and took a chance that was repaid in full. What attracted me to the movie was the actors, as I love to watch Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges do their thing. Notably the performances of Brenton Thwaites and Odeya Rush were excellent too. The plot is intelligent and well laid out in the beginning, but you get the sense that there are parts of the story missing and depth that has been skirted over. Afterwards I became aware the movie is based on a book, and can see why the abridgement was done to cram the story into a movie, but the effect was to make the plot somewhat fragmented with an inconsistent pace. The plot revelations where predictable and some had little explanation, such as one of the parental relationships, but perhaps that was me being a bit thick. I was left with a yearning to know more about the people, the history, the architecture of society, the world, but then I can always read the book now, can't I?!",The Giver
108,bsant54,A Modern Day Logan's Run,8,15 September 2014,"Same plot line/story idea as Logan's Run for a modern day audience. They toned down the special effects, concentrated on the story and it worked. The movie wants to convince us that there is more good than bad in this world and worth remembering; however, turn on the news and that hope disappears soon enough and you want to forget about it. Regardless of reality, it was a very good remake with a different take than the Logan's Run plot/story idea. The acting was very good, of course, with the likes of Bridges and Streep. The lead actor is a pretty boy but made an admirable effort in his role, he was believable for the most part. Disbelief had to be suspended in the ending as he and a baby cross desserts, blizzards and mountains with but a few blemishes to show for their effort. Oh well, everyone loves a happy ending.",The Giver
109,j-madej,I am happy that Jeff Bridges brought forth this film to our attention!,8,12 September 2014,"Whenever project takes many years to complete or takes long time to finely able to realize your vision as a filmmaker or actor it almost could be compared to a parent finely giving birth to a child. I am sure that is how Jeff Bridges must have felt when he was able to realize the dream of making a project that he was working on for over 20 years. In fact initially Jeff Bridges bought rights to the novel by Lois Lowry back in the 1990's, the role of the Giver was actually intended for his father Lloyd Bridges. Sadly his father passed away and Jeff was able to take over the role of the titled ""The Giver"" that in this movie is extremely important. I've met Jeff Bridges at screening of his movie ""Crazy Heart"" back at The Los Angeles Film School. At the time I ""prophesied"" that he will receive an Oscar nomination for his role as a country - western singer 'Bad Blake' that due to alcoholism deteriorates mentally and physically. He gotten the Oscar that year and that performance as well as other before, shown to us what a special actor he truly is. He told us in Q&A that he always felt like an extension of his family specially his father who in some way paved way for his success as an actor. The premiss of ""The Giver"" might seemed bit familiar:""It is not fully specified but it is easy to assume that after WWIII in a seemingly perfect community, without war, pain, suffering, differences or choice, a young boy is chosen to learn from an elderly man about the true pain and pleasure of the ""real"" world.""Movies like ""Hunger Games"" were successful with similar type of message other not so successful like ""Divergent"" in fact fell in to oblivion of mediocrity. ""The Giver"" falls somewhere in between both movies and can be classified as a very entertaining addition to this over crowed science fiction genre. I must say I really liked ""The Giver"". At first I thought it will be bit gimmicky in a way that first half of the movie is shot in black and white showcasing the lack of emotion in society but after a while I lost myself in the story and strong performances and started asking the same moral questions as the main character of the movie. Should we as human kind need to alleviate our basic human instincts and pleasures for the good of our species. By alleviating everything that keeps us in some way individual, there is no jealousy or felling of envy therefor subsequently we feel equal so there is no point to compete with one another. No culture is superior over another. We all are one. Like a cells in the body of an organism called human kind. However the true nature of a human being is the inclination to a competition. Not the negative kind but more understood as a tool to motivate other to progress in all scopes of life. That kind of healthy competition allowed us to venture in to the space and bring innovations in technology, medicine and other important aspects of life. This is precisely the questions ""The Giver"" puts forth with a great success I might ad. The performances are strong including sublime Meryl Streep which in someway is doing a continuation of her role in ""Doubt"" where she played a nun who tries to control the universe she is in. Jeff Bridges is thoughtful and full of wisdom as the knowledge giver who does not want to keep the status quo of the community devoid of all the natural emotions. The young generation of actors Brenton Thwaites and Odeya Rush hold their own against the old timers and deliver believable characterizations that will keep engaged the teenage viewers of the movie. As I mentioned I did enjoyed 'The Giver"" a lot and I am happy that Jeff Bridges brought forth this film to our attention. I am sure his father would be very proud of him for doing so.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",The Giver

111,starbase202,The needs of the many?,7,15 June 2015,"As stated by Spock in 'STAR TREK' - OTS: ""The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few."" This interesting movie stands that saying on its head - or does it? This movie asks a relevant question since humanity's freedoms so often result in self destructive choices. Hopefully, humanity can mature before it totally self destructs and brings the Earth along with it. On a different note, I found it difficult to understand how Jonas could escape with his baby brother and carry it through several climate zones without the baby dying. Had Jonas been able to protect it with hidden technology? And the ending left several unanswered questions in my mind: Who was in the house? Could it all have been in Jonas' imagination, including the singing and smoke from the chimney?",The Giver
112,FandomFanatic21,Search for truth. Find freedom.,8,27 April 2018,"The Giver, set in a utopian future where everyone is equal. No war, no discrimination, no inequality. The story follows Jonas when he comes of age and earns a mysterious role in his community that consists of the world's memories such as color, family, and love. These factors and more affect Jonas as he discovers the world he thought he knew. The Giver makes you look at the world differently. Shows how human actions affect everyone, and how when people are given the freedom to choose, they choose wrong. Which sheds light on how the world needs to change, I mean not perfectly. Though we should all work to better ourselves. The Giver will have you on the edge of your seat as their are hidden secrets and discoveries around every corner. Definitely recommend.""Memories are not just about the past. They determine our future. You can change things. You can make things better.""-Giver, The Giver",The Giver
113,InMyHonestOpinion,How would we be if we just forgot,7,26 December 2014,"What exactly would make a perfect world? Have you ever thought about what it is you would expect for a perfect life? Some people would say love, others would say riches and others would say a balance of all things. Imagine a world with no sadness, no loneliness, no illness, no worry or stress, no lies or guilt, no loss, no dreams, no pain, no love, no hate, no suffering and no war, a world without emotions. Would this world be ideal to you? Now imagine if you actually grew up in this exact world that has been described, you never knew about the different races of people, a world where differences were not allowed. You dressed the same, looked the same and acted the same. A world with no music, no art, no religion, no animals. A world where you are told how to dress what to eat and how to feel and even how to speak. A world where you are assigned a family, assigned what you would do or be within the community of which you live when you turn 18, a world that doesn't know death or what it means, and when these things happen there is no feeling, no emotion it is all just normality. Jonas played by Brenton Thwaites (Home and Away, Maleficent) and his 2 friends Fiona played by Odeya Rush (We are what we are) and Asher played by Cameron Monaghan (Click, Shameless) have only ever known the world I describe above and for them it is nothing but normal. At their 18th birthday the trio are assigned their positions within the community Fiona is to become a nurturer, Asher a drone pilot and finally Jonas who is last assigned but we are soon told that he hasn't been assigned at all he has actually been chosen. The community in which the trio live amongst everything they do is filmed and recorder so all his life Jonas has been watched and the Elders are more than aware that he sees the world very differently to his friends and others within the community. Jonas often in his life see's things that others cannot, things that he can't explain and for this reason he has been chosen to become the receiver of memories a position held very high amongst the community. The Giver played by Jeff Bridges (True Grit, R.I.P.D) is the current receiver of memories and he is also the person who is going to change Jonas's life as he knows it. Jonas takes his morning injection and makes his way to the edge of the community where the Giver resides ready to begin his new career. I'm not going to say any more about the plot in fear of giving too much away, I will say one thing though this film did have me glued to my seat from its colourless beginning to its more than predictable ending. I was expecting another Divergent or Hunger Games style of movie due to the Dystopian set up and from what I had seen in the trailers but I can gladly say this film definitely stands on its own. It is a beautifully filmed movie so big kudos to the director Phillip Noyce (Salt, The Bone Collector) and his team, I did love the subtlety in the way the film went from black and white to colour in select scenes. The endless amount of close-up shots of body parts or just things that should have no relevance any other time work so well. I also loved the stock footage used in selected memories as well. I loved the way the film made me feel and reflect on the things I have always known to be true and couldn't help but wonder what the generations after I have gone will be told and how they will live. The Giver also has a pretty big cast not only the people mentioned above it also stars the always fabulous Meryl Streep (The Devil Wears Prada, Mamma Mia) as The Elder, Alexander Skarsgård (Battleship, Melancholia) as Father, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek, Batman Begins) and even Taylor Swift does the film proud in her very short time on screen as Rosemary. I honestly can't say a bad thing about the characters or the actors in the film they were all great. The Giver is a film that will hopefully help you to reflect on everything you know or have been told. At the moment we live I a society where everything we are told comes from the media, we are almost told who to fear and why we should fear them, we are told what to expect and how to react. Then again perhaps I just took a lot from this film then I was supposed to. Either way I totally recommend The Giver and think it's the type of film everyone will enjoy for one reason or another even with its harsh realities.",The Giver
114,katiefanatic-791-306918,"not horrible, not great.",7,12 August 2014,"saw 'the giver' last night at the fathom events screening. It was my favorite book growing up when i read it in school and maybe the reason I wasn't horribly disappointed was because it didn't even look great from the previews. nonetheless, i watched the movie. having recently read the book in preparation for the movie, the first thing that stood out to me was how quickly they jumped into the memories. It takes about ten chapters of the book to get there, and the movie gets there in less than ten minutes. it cuts out all the build up of the book and depending on how you like the speed of your films, this could be good or bad. this could pinpoint to why the movie didn't completely work. the script was rushed. it is definitely a case of 'when good actors happen to bad scripts'. because of the nature of the script (or because the nature of the movie, who knows?) the actors aren't given much to work with. this may not be their fault as the whole point of the story is a dystopian society where they don't allow you emotions, but to watch actors have straight faces for 94 minutes isn't exactly a pleasant experience. it leaves you feeling meh about the whole thing as i did. shame.",The Giver
115,vav-61764,"The Giver: An Enjoyable Movie, but Don't Expect Anything Special From It",7,27 May 2015,"The Giver is another film that discusses a dystopian future in which the government realized that it was necessary to take measures which remove the power of freedom of society so that it could survive and advance over time. Then there's an individual who has different characteristics, who does not fit in society. Despite being a movie theme ever recurring and often used these last years, The giver is an enjoyable movie and thought-provoking about humanity, that although we have many positive qualities, malicious actions that we do to other people, animals and the planet should be analyzed more carefully.Another positive aspect of the film are the visual effects used to distinguish people who possessed something suppressed due to government actions of people who lacked this suppression. The performances were no surprises, they were OK, but Brenton Thwaites and Jeff Bridges were the most outstanding, possessing the most remarkable scenes in the film. The scenes that needed green graphic or computer screen have not been made, this is one aspect that bad movie.

118,swellframe17,A disappointing adaptation.,5,16 August 2014,"For me, Lois Lowry's ""The Giver"" was the book every middle schooler had to read and since there was no film version of it at the time, we would watch ""The Truman Show"" because it had similar themes. ""The Giver"" is a little nostalgic for me, which why I was intrigued to see a film adaptation of it. However, Phillip Noyce's ""The Giver"" is disappointing.Lowry's ""The Giver"" is a thought provoking tale about freedom, history, government, and individualism. This film adaptation, though, is very one dimensional and doesn't really get its hands deep into these heavy themes. These themes are hinted at, but brushed over quickly. The film becomes more interested in the young adult aspects and focuses more on love triangles and teen angst, which I got tired of very quickly. I didn't think an interesting story like ""The Giver"" could be watered down so much.The film establishes certain rules for its universe, but then flat out ignores them. One example is that nobody is suppose to have romantic feelings for each other. From the start, though, you can tell that there is something between Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) and Fiona (Odeya Rush). There's no denying it. As the story progresses, it gets more ridiculous. People survive things they should not and things happen that are unexplained. The film even changes the ending into something less thought provoking. From an acting standpoint, Meryl Steep and Jeff Bridges save the movie. No other performances really stood out. All the young actors were disappointing. I'm not sure if it was the character they were trying to play or if their performance was just stale. Maybe a little bit of both. Streep and Bridges do the best they can with a weak script.There is no subtlety to the film. The Giver takes the screen much sooner than he should have and the filmmakers make it very obvious. There are motifs like water and triangles that are thrown at you, but are not developed as well. The film rushes through the motifs and story. It's always driving ahead instead of stopping and looking around at the world it's in, which seems somewhat ironic in a story that is suppose to make you think about life. Ross Emery's cinematography makes the film look good. Barry Alexander Brown's editing does a good job of using color and slowly having it bleed onto the screen. Marco Beltrami's score isn't bad, but it felt misused. Because it was misused, the score made the film seem over the top at times and hindered it from being more. Phillip Noyce's ""The Giver"" is a disappointing adaptation that I thought could have been so much more. It has interesting concepts and thought provoking ideas, but this film doesn't honor them and becomes a one dimensional blockbuster. I'd suggest sticking with the book.",The Giver
119,Fourstrawberries,"Formulaic, totally predictable, utterly boring.",2,15 September 2014,"Yet another shallow and predictable lesson in morality from Hollywood. Worse still, this tale has been done before. The similarities to Equilibrium and Aeon Flux verge on plagiarism in my opinion. Not to say morality lessons can't be done well, see District 9 and Elysium, but they are usually done badly, see Hunger Games and this effort. We all know Utopia drives humans nuts (Matrix, where they had to introduce misery to make it work), we all know utopias unravel when humans realise they can have freedom instead of paradise(Forbidden Planet) the story is thousands of years old (Adam and Eve and the garden of Eden).

120,ken_bethell,Suspend belief ..... completely,5,8 November 2014,"If, like me, you find it difficult to suspend belief when faced with illogical and irrational story lines then you might have a problem enjoying this piece of science fantasy. Dismiss from your mind immediately how a technologically advanced society could exist, above the snowline, on cloud-shrouded mountain top in total isolation with no apparent means of life support. Well they do have have climate control. I however will not comment further on that. Forget about enquiring where children come from (test tube?) in a population given regular injections to suppress their basic human feelings including sex. But do consider how the community leader (Streep) can have no scruples when it comes to murdering children who threaten her doctrine but who strangely tolerates and even encourages the activities of a sage character (Bridges), the'Giver', who imparts dangerous knowledge to a chosen 'receiver' as a part of periodic ritual. Are we suppose to believe that the Bridges character represents Streep's unconscious desire to want to return society to the way it was? You must draw your own conclusions on that one. The acting is fine and there is even a brief appearance by Taylor Swift who with dark hair looked uncannily like Scarlett Johanssen in recent roles.

121,sugarfreepeppermint,Weinstein brothers peddle more globalist filth,2,19 February 2016,"The few stars that I have given, are for the main young actor, he is a sight to behold. Unfortunately, the film itself seems to impose upon the viewer a dualism between either a totalitarian society without emotion, or one that is less controlled but which comes with joy and pain. Who-ever said that a nation that is both controlled and also has joy and colours isn't possible? A nation which controls its borders can still enjoy the diversity of the world, but without indiscriminately importing those other cultures and people and its problems and diseases into it. The Weinstein brothers once again try to prompt into a new generation the idea that their own society needs globalisation in order to be ""something valuable,"" to be free. It is globalisation that is enslaving them into a true fascist regime however. The film implies that nationalism is bad, whilst it currently is the only hope of all new Western generations to escape from the crises that have been foisted upon them by the global elites. The insertion of colourful National Geographic footage to visualize the ""healing"" wonders of ""diversity,"" is just plain lazy and mendaciously simplistic.This film left a very bad taste in my mouth.

But it just didn't come together! This is the kind of story that would be better done by less well known actors because I can only imagine how much pressure must have been put on the producer and director to dumb down the story to make it commercially viable. Lets face it, sometimes art and and capitalism simply don't mix!The philosophy behind The Giver reminds me of a famous dictum by none other than the Buddha himself. To summarize: Avoid all extremes. Life is neither black or white, but an endless variety of other colors. Don't become evil - or do evil - to prevent evil. Find the middle way. The world of The Giver is about living life grossly out of balance. Something most society's in the world - including our own - are doing right now!",The Giver

Very little tension, a lot of talking, asexual in every way, no violence, not much of anything, actually. A bloodless society and a bloodless movie.OK...so is it an allegory for the possible direction of modern society? Perhaps, but neither the right nor the left appears to be moving in this silly direction. But it seems to me that more of the message was: if we give up our bad passions, we must also lose the good ones. Is it worth it? This movie doesn't seem to think so, and neither do I, but the way the story unfolds is too tedious to take. A movie that runs for 94 minutes seems to be 2.5 hours long.Really...don't bother.",The Giver
127,six2561,Very good movie. Interesting topic.,9,23 August 2014,"I went in knowing nothing about this movie. Not that it came from a book, not that Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges starred in it (an amazing bonus for me), not the subject matter. Nothing. I loved it. It was quite different than anything I've ever seen. Good story, somewhat on the scary side. Not horror movie scary, but in a ~ is this the place where this country can end up? ~ kinda way. But Jonas break's free and goes over the edge to find the place of dreams and memories, pleasure and pain. Real life. I found it most interesting when the lead Elder Streep... who spends her days regulating the perfect utopia, where people live free of wants or needs or crime or jealousy or anything that may lead one to feel different or unique beyond anyone else.... immediately turns to wanting Jonas murdered, and by his friend Asher no less, as soon as she realizes he's a rebel and heading for that great beyond which will restore the Utopian Stepford back to a town of thinkers and feelers and dreamers with memories and color & Life. It was also interesting that baby killing is still prevalent and even OK within this perfect community. Movie makes a huge statement towards life today in that everything is awesome and good and flowery and perfect if you do as I say and think like I think. But tolerance ends if you dare to use your own mind and challenge those who truly believe that THEY are perfect & right in every way. I guess the book was prophetic back when it was written in 1993.",The Giver
128,Steve-Zoicks,Slow but heart warming,5,15 November 2018,A story of what makes us human and how the desertion of emotions can have a positive effect on society but a disastrous effect on human kind.While the actors held their characters well and the inter-conflicts felt real there was no real understanding or reason as to the main Character wanting to be human. It almost felt as if he was a rebel going against he grain.The beginning tries to tie in a relationship between 3 friends where love of course concurs all but it left a feeling of confusion towards the end.A short movie that could have had more done to it if they added 30 minutes to try to explain why the main character seeks for the outer circle.I guess the Giver was never really giving.,The Giver
129,gian_99,Ruined by the ending,7,11 December 2017,"I watched this on Netflix, and was a bit unsure after reading some newspaper reviews from movie critics. I think this movie has been judged too harshly. I did not have any problem understanding the ""how"" human society got there. How it was possible to consider so much of the joys we take in life as something to be sacrificed for the opportunity not to suffer the pain we have. I did not have a problem to imagine a society orderly organizing the lives of every single member of the community. Some feature of the organization attained by the movie's society are old ideas really, out of some philosopher's dreams (or out of everybody else's nightmare): Plato's Republic came to my mind, during some parts of the movie, except that the society in the movies arrives to strikingly similar results from following objectives which are way different (getting rid of pain was not Plato's objective in an ideal organization of society). I liked the acting, especially in the character of the Giver, Fiona and Jonas. I think the use of black and white was interesting. What almost managed to ruin the whole movie was the rushed ending. It could have been much better: but as it is, it just looks like the money to keep filming suddenly finished up and they had to look for a quick way to end the movie. In any case it's still a 7.",The Giver
130,rudolfravbar,"Another movie about teens, but this one is different!",9,22 March 2015,"The Giver is another movie based on a book, but this time: The Giver by Lois Lowry.This film, based on Lois Lowry's book, tells the story of a perfect world. Everyone here is happy. When Jonas is 18 years old, he's chosen to be the community's Receiver of Memories. He enters into training with an old man called 'the Giver' who would give Jonas memories of the ""real"" world that the rest of the community is hidden from. From the Giver, Jonas learns not only of love and family, but also of pain, war, and all the unhappy truths the world holds. He quickly realizes that his community is fake. Confronted with this reality, Jonas faces difficult choices about his own life and the futures of many people he's become close to.So, storyline is well made in this movie. Everything in this movie in so smoothly going on that you'll have a feeling like you are watching documentary. Story reminds me of Divergent and somehow to Hunger Games, but, of course, there are a big differences. That world without color is so good made. That whole idea about no color and perfect world, world without wars and hatred is cool and somehow, I was waiting for that idea.Acting in this movie is a bit strange, I can't tell if it's good or bad, it doesn't fit anywhere. Jeff Bridges starring the Giver did good. He knew what was going to happen if he show him too much. Brenton Thwaites in role of Jonas did good too. He wanted more and more, and he got it. Effects in this movie are good. No color world, like I told before, is really good. I am looking forward for ideas like that.Soundtracks in this movie are not bad, but not good to. Some of songs fit well in a whole story and scenes, but some of them are not fitting anywhere.At the end, if you are a fan of book based movies and if you like teen movies as well (not Twilight), you will like this movie a lot.",The Giver

There is also a reason I never read a book right before the movie comes out,I want to judge it on it's own merits. I really enjoyed The Giver,it really made me feel. It celebrated life and everything that comes with it;love,joy,laughter,sadness and everything in between. Things we take for granted like music. The story itself is pretty straightforward but that's not necessarily a bad things. Most of the acting was good, Jeff Bridges however was the stand out to me. Using black and white and colour to show what the community is lacking was used well.",The Giver
132,The-Ambassador,Great Ideas but Not Great Delivery,6,27 November 2014,"For a book with so much hype and respect one would expect more from a film version of THE GIVER, especially considering it's noteworthy cast. The bottom line with this film is that it is absolutely filled to the brim with intriguing intellectual ideas but the director / producer team that created the film never goes much further than implying this. They almost never actually deliver any truly mind blowing material to sink ones teeth into. It comes off more like a young adult after school special at best, real throw away stuff. And yet the whole time there is this feeling that we're missing something much deeper and more thoughtful than what is on the surface. Unfortunately the film just peters out into a typical Hollywood theme park ride by the end. Worth a watch? Sure. But don't expect much more.",The Giver
133,kersus,Wasted Potential,5,5 April 2019,"There is a lot to like about The Giver. It isn't a new idea nor is it executed in any special way however it's still an idea full of potential that builds to a very anticlimactic ending.Despite the big name cast, the acting is average with a couple solid performances by Cameron Monaghan and Odeya Rush. Jeff Bridges also takes centre stage with his presence and gruff charm.It feels like so much more could be done with this but at the end it was like the screenwriter had painted themselves into a corner and didn't know a way out.I have not read the source material. This is worth seeing for free or on a service you already subscribe to but don't go out of your way.",The Giver

By staying logical yourself you can see why they don't see like the rebels and why they see them as dangerous.Though it stays a shame that modern day movies like this don't know how to properly end a movie like this. They should not just tel the watcher what happens after. They should let us see some of that. Just to get that real feeling of satisfaction.",The Giver

As I watched the beginning it was engaging so I watched. I had never even heard of this movie or the plot and certainly did not know it was a book. But it definitely sicked me in. It had good actors and tge story was intriguing. Of course I could tell this was more geated to a younger audience and it seemed like a low budget film. I am not goung to post anythi g to ruin the movie for others. It is well worth watching amd I look forward to seeing it again. I like seeing a movie like this, The Hunger Games, Enders Game, etc over because it was almost like you needed to have read the book to really get what was going on.

136,aegiswiz-accede,Pleasant adaptation of the book...,8,19 December 2014,"So, what is it about. This is a dystopian class of science fiction novel that engineers society to avoid the nightmares of the horrors of the past (our present and near future). Their plan, which appears to work wonderfully, is to make society generic, so to speak, without all the plagues upon us now such as emotions, deeply held religious beliefs, feeling of honor to defend beliefs, and so on.No soylent green scenes or implications but the undertones appear later in the story. Not so much with food, but Eugenics appears to be a major influence on this new Utopian, dystopian society.You would need to check Goodreads dot com for my review of the book. As I recall, I wasn't terribly impressed. Perhaps I was, it is a wonder of a story. Literary and video. I never allow my expectations wander far with a movie adapted from a book. This one, however is really stunning to me.Yes, 2-300 pages of book (or more) were adopted to a ~120 page film script. You're not going to do the book on film without some groaning from the book fans.*spoiler alert* The ""training"" before Jonas makes a decision is much longer and involved in the book. The activity after deciding towards Jona's new knowledge is also rather extended in the book. Fortunately for fans of either or both, the film adaptation scraps much to the cutting room floor that doesn't effect the story much at all. Great job! (I'm almost never a fan of book adaptations). */spoiler alert*Ultimately, it isn't really a 5 star outing, but that is because I've read the book. The story is unique and because I was intimately aware of the book, perhaps I filled in blanks in the movie an average viewer may be unable to construe for lack of reading. So, to me, we land at 5 stars when it could be 3-5 stars for a wandering viewer looking to watch something interesting.",The Giver
137,isabelle-frater,"Full of clichés, generic YA dystopia",4,14 September 2014,"I wasn't very keen on watching this movie, but as is apparent from my previous reviews, I tend to keep an open mind. There were other movies I wasn't very excited about, and I liked them. The reason why I watched this movie? Alex Skarsgard. Yeah, he's beautiful, and I love his voice, so I decided to check this one out. I also saw that a lot of my online book friends loved the book version. Well, let me just say that I hope the book is better.I can use one word to describe this movie. Simplistic. The book came out in 1993, before the hype of The Hunger Games, and other dystopian YA books, so in a way it's a forerunner of its time. However, while watching the movie it did remind me of a few things I saw or read that were made before 1993, so let's start the dystopian cliché list, that is now so familiar to us all. City surrounded by some sort of a barrier that people can't cross. Two things come to mind, and remember, I haven't seen and read all dystopian novels, so this is just from my small pool of reference. Zamyatin's Us had a wall, the city in Logan's Run was built underground. It is a basic trope in dystopia to limit travel, to cut people off from the outside world in order to control them. Getting rid of older people, celebrate it, and have the people not care that they are gone. This was actually a very basic part of Logan's Run. Breed people, not have a traditional family structure. I'd need to write a list, this is so common. It was basically in every dystopian fiction I come across and was written before 1993. People forget their history, no books. I will have to say Logan's Run again. Lois Lowry must adore the movie. Main character realises there is something wrong, and escapes. Okay, this is a bit of a cheat, because in dystopia the most common plot is that someone tries to rebel against the establishment. It's sort of a requirement. Main character escapes, and best friend comes after them. I hate to say this, but Logan's Run once more. I don't know how it is in the book, I don't suppose that it's a drone. Truth to be told, the friend turns out differently in Logan's Run. Humanity taken away by a drug, people are conditioned to think one way. Brave New World. There is conditioning, though a bit more heavy-duty than here, and you have a drug which there acts more apparently like a drug, but the purpose is the same. To not notice how crazy everything is. Cameras everywhere. Need I write a list here? When they put cameras all over London, people were saying Big Brother is watching. There may have been a couple of more, but I won't bore you. The story was a simplistic mash of a lot of clichés in dystopia. Maybe there is more depth in the book, because so many people loved it. However, if I summarised the movie, it would sound like a lot of dystopias. At least it felt short.The characters are simply not exciting, or surprising. They feel like cardboard cut-outs. Jonas is the main protagonist. He is chosen to hold the memories of the past by taking them from the old Keeper of Memories, who becomes the Giver. This is done through some mind sharing, which isn't explained at all in the movie. Now in this world people don't seem to have too much of a personality, and that is sort of the point. He is more enthusiastic about things than the rest of the people even before he stops taking the drugs. Otherwise, I really don't know what to write about him. He's good with a baby. Let's also admit that he could have turned out to be a terrible person off the drugs, as could anyone. However, it's probably because of their simple upbringing, he is more like a small child than a young adult. He looks at everything with an innocence that was partly the point of keeping the memories of the past away from these people. The Giver is your typical old man. Jaded, obviously has a history with the Chief Elder. He's the one who leads Jonas on his journey. Fiona is the love interest. Rather, the cut-out of a love interest. I really don't have much to say about her either, since I learned very little of her other than she's pretty, and has a caring nature.The thing that I find most unlike the rest of the dystopias is the YA aspect. I can't remember having read or seen anything that had such a young protagonist, but I probably haven't seen everything. It left a lot of questions in my mind. I still don't know how the community came about, what the rest of the world is like, or how the barrier worked, or a lot of other things. I was hoping for some great reveal, but none came. The ending just raised even more questions.Overall, watchable, but not all that great. It didn't excite me, or make me want to read the book. It just left me baffled how so many people can like the book. I sincerely hope it's a lot better. I can only recommend it if you have 100 minutes to kill, and there's nothing else.",The Giver
138,AStormOfSwords13,Ordinary,5,1 May 2015,"If any film ever deserved to simply be called ordinary, this movie would have my vote. With successful dystopia onslaughts such as Hunger Games and Divergent, both of which come from books, it only stands to reason that The Giver would have its day in the cinemas from the world of ink, paper, and 0's and 1's. Not that I've ever read the book, mind you, but it would explain the film getting made. But that's besides the point.The Giver is just a run-of-the-mill dystopia story that does not do anything memorable in any notable way. It does not make an impression by being horrible even though the beginning of the film did have moments where I wanted to cringe. It certainly isn't a film I would go flocking to see again. While not long, it isn't VERY short either. It is really just an ordinary film, maybe best watched when getting wasted. I also didn't really give a toot about any of the characters, which is a shame because I definitely wanted to see how Taylor Swift does as an actress. Oh well! Maybe next movie.I will say that Jonas was halfway decent as a hero and so I do end up rooting for him, but again, he's nothing amazing. He's really just there to be the main protagonist and nothing more.The premise in this movie reminds me a little of this book called ""The Beard That was Evil"" or something along those lines. I forgot who the author of that was, but I kind of relate this movie to that book.Overall though, The Giver doesn't really ""give"" me anything worth remembering about the movie and there is nothing about this movie I would call extraordinary.

139,mrturk182,Pandering at its Finest,2,11 June 2015,"Back in the seventh grade, I had to read a book for class called ""The Giver"". I wasn't that interested in the book when I first read it, but that was because I never got excited. I felt a little bored by the story and failed to interpret it. Last year, I had to read it again for a college class, which was on young adult novels. When I read it again, I really appreciated the book a lot more at age 23 than I did at age 13. It's a shame because the story aims at that kid-teen transition period that my class was going through back then and did a great job at selling that coming-of-age message, and now, I have to defend the book against this heinous film adaptation. I don't want to go into too much detail on what it got wrong, but what tipped me off the most was the character, Jonas. In the book, he's a 12-year old. Here, he's 16 YEARS OLD! Even more flabbergasting is that the actor playing him is in his MID- TWENTIES! That's way past the description of Jonas given in the book. I'm only going to mention that part, but trust me, the movie didn't stop there. This YA- adaptation tries to cater to the high-school audiences waiting for the next Hunger Games and Divergent sequels. Instead, it spits on the actual coming-of-age morals displayed in the source material.",The Giver
140,nti-547-765973,A romanticized Hollywood-ized version of the book,6,16 July 2020,"Having read the book quite recently the essence of it, as I perceived it, is still fresh. I would rate the book an 8/10 - I truly enjoyed and respected it, but I am not a hardcore fan.That being said, the main pylons of its plot are all here, in the movie, but the way they are presented and put together feels... wrong, the message is watered down. It loses its spark of genius, it lacks its original depth - which is highly ironic as depth of feeling is one of the main themes.The book was a multi-faceted pondering on what makes us human, whilst the movie is more like a spoon fed adequately-acted pleasantly-displayed conclusion. All the same elements are there and the elements are beautiful on their own, of course, but they didn't elevate nor meet the material provided, instead they made it a cheesy simplistic version of itself.With a different adaptation watching this movie really could have been, should have been a memorable experience.🙃 Safe to say this was not.",The Giver
141,warrenf_peace,"""The Giver"" Presents a Thought-Provoking Look at Our Future *SPOILERS*",8,18 August 2014,"******* SPOILERS *******I went to ""The Giver"" this weekend with no preconceptions; I hadn't read the book, and had only seen one marketing trailer beforehand. All I knew was that the always excellent Jeff Bridges was in the title role, the Queen of American Cinema Meryl Streep, pop-princess Taylor Swift, the intelligently beautiful Katie Holmes and some Australian I never heard of (who ended up being quite good) Brenton Thwaites, rounded out the talented cast. I did read the IMDb blurb, so I knew this had something to do with a dystopian future, but with some artful black & white photography would be in play. As soon as the film opened, I settled in for the ride, and immediately the music, and the tone of the film, reminded me of Gattaca (which I consider a very good thing).It starts out establishing the principle characters, and you can tell straight away that Streep's Chief Elder is the ""heavy"", and Bridges as the ""Giver"" is the anti-hero. I love the way they played with humor in the film, and how his name was derived is certainly no exception (Thwaites is the ""Receiver of Memory"", and he asks Bridges what that made him, having passed his 'job' on to the younger lad, wherein Bridges coquettishly replies, ""Well, I guess that makes me the Giver."" Indeed, and give, he does - perhaps more than he is expected to.) As one might surmise, their relationship grows, while 'The Giver' starts crossing the powers that be (Streep). As Thwaites (as 'The Receiver') evolves and begins to learn about the ruin the previous society inflicted on his world. Hijinks ensure, working towards the exciting finish. I refrain from giving away much more, because the more left unsaid, the better movie-going experience one should have. Let me conclude by saying ""those fools in Q branch"" ( the film critics..) should be spending more time gardening, or doing anything else but writing reviews, because from my read, they seem to be utterly jaded beyond the hope of a conscience. They seem incapable of writing a fair and accurate review. Hence, my diatribe here, now!As a SciFi fan (and I loved Tron: Legacy, as well as Gattaca, and Fahrenheit 451 - another film it reminded me of..), I may be more forgiving to this film than a regular movie goer, and if so, I apologize. But due to my love of the genre, I think I have a high standard, which should make me a tough judge (and should explain my comments, and my 7.5 score). I actually think the film is better than that, but because of some other minor production issues too trivial and picayune to mention, I won't. So don't give me any grief - I don't take that from the public. You see, I'm not a taker; I'm a giver!",The Giver
142,roythedog,Hollywood needs to stop giving dark subject matter the family film treatment,6,2 June 2020,"The book this movie is based on, gave off the vibe that the writings of George Orwell did. Concepts such as totalitarian society, no freedom of expression, no individuality, no privacy, and a world where conformity was expected and not to be questioned. While Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep's performances were some of the best in their modern careers, Brenton Thwates was not the right casting as Jonas. At least Katie Holmes and Alexander Skarsgard gave performances like the characters they were supposed to be playing, but they were boring and wooden even for a movie with this kind of source material. As I said the book was a cautionary tale on the type of society that could arise from civil unrest and conflict, a message we need more then ever today. This movie did what holes did and watered down and sanitized the darkness, graphic imagery, and emotion of the book and made it into a family film which is not what it should be. The ending although ambiguous like in the book was still yet another generic happy ending. Hollywood needs to stop giving dark subject matter the family film treatment.",The Giver

A daily injection of every member of ""the Community"" ensures that memories and emotions are suppressed, along with freedom, choice, individuality, religion -- and temptation.""When people have the freedom to choose, they choose wrong, every single time,"" intones the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep).Everything in this Orwellian world is identical and monochromatic: homes, clothes, even the family unit. Just two children per household, one boy and one girl, each genetically engineered and born to designated birth mothers. When the children come of age, they receive their vocation, the role they are to play in the Community. The time has come for Mother and Father to present their son, Jonas.Sensing something unusual about the teen, the Chief Elder selects Jonas to inherit the esteemed position of Receiver of Memories, a kind of repository of the past, warts and all.The current Receiver, known as the Giver, is weary, shopworn, and ready to pass the baton. He's haunted by the failure of a recent designee, Rosemary, and is determined to succeed with Jonas.""If you can't feel, what is the point?"" he asks. That belief is reinforced by his growing love for a fellow teen, Fiona, along with the Giver's wisdom that ""with faith comes love and hope.""Jonas' determination that everyone in the Community should share in his knowledge is accelerated when he uncovers a dark secret: the Elders sanction euthanasia to eliminate imperfect babies and the frail elderly.There is a disturbing scene in ""The Giver"" involving child euthanasia that many upset younger viewers. For mature teens and their parents, however, it can spark a necessary conversation about the sanctity of life at all ages, winningly endorsed by this worthy film.",The Giver

147,jake-lamotta-batman,"Generic in many ways, this one was best left as a book.",1,14 September 2014,"This movie is quite terrible in many fashions, firstly you have the Black & White, Colour thing, which is a decent enough idea but looked terrible in this movie, there are scenes were colour is supposed to creep in, then once the Protagonist sees colour everywhere that is how the film is presented, until he leaves his community, at which point the community goes back to being shown in Black & White. Quite simply, Pleasantville used a much better tactic in obtaining this effect, it also provides a much better film overall with more carefully constructed social messages. Something I notice like a sore thumb, was every time we had these ""Flashackesque"" sequences, we literally hear someone in the flashback describe what is happening, for example, Jeff Bridges introduces the kid to music, then the kid visualizes a wedding celebration from which we hear ""It's a Wedding!"" (this is not a joke, that line is literally said during the sequence, because that's normal dialogue). Further examples of this lazy script, Jeff Bridges mentally transports the kid to a war, obviously they're depicting Vietnam (to the point of having the enemy solider a female, as if this were some lame ass homage to Full Metal Jacket with the female sniper), and during this scene, clearly heard over the solders radio, ""Women and Children are Dying on us!"" Finally we get a vision given to the kid by Jeff Bridges (this is actually in no particular order, the script writer didn't care, why should I?) is of an Elephant hunt, once elephants are being shot and killed, the protagonist says, ""They're killing elephants!""This movie is like watching Joel Schumacher trying to make a Terrence Malick Picture, especially when it gets near the end and they try to have sequences which came off like a cheap knock off ""Tree of Life."" Do not watch this film, read the book, if you have finished the book, wait until you are an adult to watch this, do not let this film taint the book for you (not that it was a masterpiece, but when you're a kid, you should be building the visual world in your own mind, and by doing so, you will only create a more entertaining and well thought out world than the one which was created for this film).",The Giver
148,LiveYoLifeLikeYouMeanIt,Damn Fine,9,17 December 2015,"The Giver is based on a 1993 novel by Lois Lowry, and I believe, it is definitely among the best book to movie translations in recent history. As we are all very well aware, there is an almost tiresome influx of YA dystopian novels that for the most part, are mere cash grabbing franchises that feed of the wonder off of adolescence, a time when the young transcend into adulthood and are faced with several conundrums and questions as to their purpose, ambitions and their very identity in society. The Hunger Games, Divergent, Maze Runner, The Host, and other such series come to mind. Contrary to the portrayal of both society and teen angst, The Giver is much less of a 'blockbuster' motion picture in that it does not feature big guns and fight scenes, nor does it have any sudden(and absurd) twists and turns to throw the viewer off balance. There is no hero, there is no villain and there is no traitor. There are just people. People who are prone to make every mistake possible, but also maybe rectify these mistakes, if only they were given a chance. This more subdued and less outlandish representation of Dystopia, has apparently baffled critics because they seem to be unable to grasp this sudden and drastic change from the conventional YA dystopian lore that they are so used to that they have misunderstood the purpose and intent of this movie, so far as claiming that it is a less ambitious and mundane tale of teenage problems. Browsing through reviews in RottenTomatoes, I was appalled to see that some critics immediately dismissed the movie with opening statements simply like ""Another YA Dystopia"", ""Hunger Games spin off"" and ""Teenager out to save the world"". I understand that there are many movies based on the premise of dictatorships and oppression of the masses and the simultaneous coming of age of some good teenagers along the way, but it is very unfair to dismiss The Giver, because it is definitely different in message and execution, to THG. Every crime movie has a crime, criminal and cop, every comic book movie has a superhero, villain and a world to save, but do we accuse that crime thriller of having a murder, claiming it is so predictable and just so mundane in that all crime stories have murder/murders?Extremely absurd isn't it? Do we accuse hardly ANY of the many many superhero movies that are frankly crowding the world way more than YA Dystopia, for starring the cliché charismatic hero and his love interest, and the villain with a charisma all his own and a purpose so blatantly half-cooked and absurd? How different are The Avengers, The Winter Soldier, and Guardians Of the Galaxy, really? There are heroes who have small fight scenes for most of the movie, with the final mega battle being fought over a city with the mothership hovering above, only to be ultimately destroyed, thus saving mankind for the umpteenth time in the most generic manner. Yes, that is all there is to these comic book movies if we really strip them bare, the very way many critics and other, may I say, adults, collectively describe any and all YA features. So let us stop this unfair bashing of YA movies and books, merely for a passable similarity in concept. Judge it on its OWN merit.This movie had all the elements for a heartfelt and honest rendition of the world created in the book. There were several alterations to the book itself, but I felt all the changes added to the world building very well and brought a sliver better characterization in the movie, while not affecting the profound themes that the book explores. The interweaving of the memories brought forth by the Giver, and the stark, colourless portrayal of the world itself, was handled with clarity and care. By far the montage of real pictures that showcased life as it is in today's world were among the most affecting aspect of the movie, urging the viewer to realise, reflect and remember what it means to be human, and how there are so many things to look forward to, despite how troubled things may seem. The acting by the entire cast was perfect(except for Taylor Swift, that is). Of course there were a couple of scenes in the book that I wished were depicted in the movie, but their absence in no way hampered the movie itself. The visuals were pleasing to the eye and the background score was near brilliant. The Giver is among the most thought provoking and heartfelt movies to permeate the genre we have so heavily discussed above. It is strong and daring, without being inappropriate or disturbing in clear acknowledgement to the very source material and the obvious audience that will most easily lap this sort of cinema up. I read the book last night and watched the movie today, and so the memory of the book was of course very vivid. It very powerfully completed and brought a sense of wholeness to the world created in the book. In terms of world building, concept and thematic exploration it is faithful to the book, and any complaints with regard to this aspect are again unfair since this would not be the fault of the ""YA dystopian"" movie itself, but instead be because of the viewer's dislike of the material in the book itself, in which case the disappointment should be, in truth, with the book and not really the movie. All in all, The Giver is a fine, fine film, the viewing of which will no doubt be complimented by a quick read/re-read of the book, so as to appreciate the themes explored to the full extent possible. Competent acting, direction, background score and visuals with an obvious love for its source material, this is good cinema, that deserves much more praise than it is being meted out.",The Giver
149,cteavin-1,"Good movie, not a copy of the book so warrants a watch just for that",7,15 November 2014,"I read the book when I heard it was going to be made into a movie. As I was reading I wondered how they could film it. The answer is that they can't. Instead they took the concept and worked out a three act story line with hero and villains. I'm sure the dissatisfaction I've read here is partly due to trying to make something that is almost unfilmable a movie. It's well made. If you've read the book, it's worth seeing how they made it into a film. I've shown this to my high school classes several times and they have loved it. It presents a simple idea that resonates. The characters might behave differently than you'd expect given their upbringing, but if you're going to watch a movie whose premise is that two people can collectively hold the memories of the world in their minds, roll with that discrepancy and enjoy what the movie has to say. It's weakest point is the ending, not in the outcome but in the physical distances they cover. If you pay attention to the timing the film makers went too far in trying to be cinematic given the time frame they had to work with. Again, given the premise, it's forgivable -- and beautiful.",The Giver

151,pratikshya-mishra72,Not that impressed...,6,27 January 2015,"Though I am not that impressed by the movie, I like its significance and the message it conveys. I like the scenes of fun and frolic, dance and music, love and loss of a mother, thrill of an adventure, fear of falling, satisfaction of surviving, willpower to lead countries, and patriotism of countrymen. Otherwise the plot is threadbare and predictable, the climax is feeble and acting is kind of okey. Actually this whole dystopian world was not that convincing.But the book that this movie is based on is rather popular. I wonder why the title is 'The Giver', when the story actually revolves around 'The Receiver'.https://pratikshya2.wordpress.com/2015/01/28/the-giver/",The Giver
152,urgentneptune,The Giver Review,7,25 August 2014,"The GiverThe Giver is based on the famous 1993 novel written by Lois Lowry. The Giver takes place in a Utopian/dystopian future where the memories of the past have been erased from history and every citizen's feelings are suppressed. I read the book a couple years ago, but I never got into it like some other hardcore fans. You know, like the people that build shrines praising the book and who sacrifice goats and other domesticated animals in its name because it's the best book of all time? That isn't me.Actually, I'm really getting tired of the whole dystopian future theme that has been smothering the movie industry recently. There are so many movies out there that aren't ""based"" on books, but steal multiple aspects from several books in order to create a genuinely interesting and somewhat original film. The best example of this I can think of is the movie Equilibrium. Starring Christian Bale (a.k.a. Batman), Equilibrium is like a cross between Fahrenheit 451, The Matrix, and, of course, The Giver. The film didn't receive good ratings because it ""stole"" ideas, but I find that it takes the best qualities from each source, and has become one of my favorite movies of all time.*Sigh* But I digress. Let's get back to the review.PlotMain character Jonas ""Last Name Here"" is a young boy who has always know that there is ""something more"" and when he assigned to be the new ""receiver of memories"" of his community. He then becomes the padawan for the current owner of memories/ the giver: Jeff Bridges. After discovering how unfair and oppressive the government is being, Jonas steals a baby, and trek through some of the harshest climates in the surrounding area in order to somehow return all the memories to the citizens of the community. The movie actually follows the book pretty well, with the exception of something called a Boundary of Memory, which, if passed by a receiver of memory, will return all the memories to common populace. This mechanic's sole purpose is to give Jonas a goal as he travels across the wilderness with a baby. That he stole!The biggest problem I had with the film was the definitive ending. In the novel, the reader is left with a Inception sort of ending, left to decide for themselves what really happened. This movie absolutely destroys that notion by basically saying, ""This is definitely how it happened and there is no other interpretation."" By prohibiting each viewer from having a different experience, The Giver goes against its own theme of individuality, along with ruining what made the book so special.Acting/DialogueThe Giver introduces some new talent in the form of young actors. Besides Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, and a few other big names, the film mostly features unknown youth. I'm sure some of these young and talented will go on to do great things, because they all demonstrate their skill in this film.I thought the dialogue was a bit rushed. There are some great lines delivered by Bridges, but overall the movie was very to the point. SFX/ActionThe community and scenery of the movie look great. The movie starts in black and white, but as Jonas unlocks the ability to see color, the world brightens up and becomes quite beautiful. A couple of the CGI aircrafts look kind of crappy, and the film lacks any action or fight scenes whatsoever. Actually, there is one scene where some guards storm Jeff Bridges' house, but he doesn't put up much of a fight and ends up flopping on the ground after being tased. Award Time!Best Performance: Jeff Bridges for his role as The Giver. Best Character: The GiverBest Baby: Saige Fernandes for his/her performance as Gabriel at 6 months.ConclusionAs a novel, there is no doubt that the The Giver has influenced the sci-fi genre today. But as a film, The Giver just doesn't live up to expectations. I ironically give The Giver a 7.5/10. It was good, but not great.",The Giver
153,erkucz00,"Better than expected.., but still lacking.",7,22 May 2015,"I fully expected this book to be a terrible movie. It is based on a book published in the early 90s, long before the scores of dime-a- dozen teen dystopia thrillers began frequenting our libraries and theaters. The characters' roles were very well played. I wasn't terribly impressed, but Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep conveyed their opposing viewpoints very well. The head elder wasn't just a 2-dimensional dystopian leader; It was clear that she actually believed that what she was doing was for the good of mankind. The Giver's sadness over his daughter's death was also conveyed in an interesting was. Jeff Bridges portrayal of the giver is (In my opinion) the only part that was accurate according to what happened and how the giver acted in the book. Both actors' parts made the film interesting to watch by adding layers of intrigue that the movie was otherwise lacking.However, while this movie exceeded my expectations, I must admit that I had exceptionally low expectations. This movie screamed so loudly: ""I want to be 'The Hunger Games', or 'Divergent', but I'm not."" The setting was obviously modeled after other dystopian atmospheres that were not in the book. Things like the very ""peacekeeper-esque"" guards and the drone plane with some kind of magnet,(actually I'm not sure what it was. A future vacuum cleaner perhaps?) may have been cool in theory, but greatly cheapened the movie. This movie's failure is not its own fault. While I admit It could have stayed true to itself a little more, to fault this movie would be like faulting an amateur basketball player for getting dunked on by Michael Jordan. Lois Lowry's 1993 young adult novel was much more than a simple dystopia story, and the movie just couldn't live up to that. While I believe some of the makers desired the film to be a masterpiece, watching it led Me to believe that most of them desired to make a quick buck on the teen dystopia phenomenon sweeping the nation. I still remember reading the book, and discovering for the first time that Jonas's ability permitted him to see color in a black and white world. The movie ruined this by revealing it in the first ten seconds. This like many of the book's integral plot points were botched, or left out entirely. Some books are intended to be published, read, and left alone. Not made into mediocre movies. The Giver is one of them.",The Giver
154,swarthylad,Shades of 1984 & Logan's Run,9,16 August 2014,"Just saw it tonight. Movie starts off B&W so we get a feel for what the characters feel... a drab and emotionless life devoid of any expression. As our lead character Jonas ""receives"" knowledge from the Giver, the world opens up and he learns a lot of wonderful things and some very bad things about this Utopian society. There is no death only ""sent"" away. Babies being ""sent"" away is a hard pill for anyone to see especially for Jonas. Reminded me of the scene from Logan's run where he learns there is no ""renewal"" at age 40. Jonas was well played by the up and coming Aussie actor.... think we will be seeing more of him. The very end led me wanting to know what happened next.... doubt there is a sequel coming but would really like to see the aftermath of the fall of this Utopia. Maybe that is just me. Anyway, I highly recommend!",The Giver
155,xaniver,Not bad but didn't blow me away,6,13 January 2015,"Had I known Taylor Swift was in this movie, I might have been less enthusiastic about the film, however, I can promise you that any Taylor Swiftness on posters and in promo is all a marketing ploy. She has a tiny – if important – role in the film and has very little screen time. The real star of the show is Brenton Thwaites as Jonas and he's really quite lovely in his role as the compassionate and curious Receiver.The Giver film is competing against franchises like The Hunger Games, Divergent and even The Maze Runner. In order to give The Giver more teen appeal and to capture The Hunger Games/Divergent audience, the movie tried to be a lot that the book was not. The movie – despite being adapted from the predecessor of the modern dystopian trend – feels a little too familiar and cliché because it tries a little too hard to fit in aesthetically and tonally with the other YA adaptations. I wish the film had foregone the shiny technology additions and stuck with the utilitarian world-building of the book. I can also understand why the film producers chose to up the age of the protagonists and up the angst as well, but I'm not sure it really added all that much to the overall story except making it feel like another teen movie when it should've been so much more than that.Where the film did excel was in the cinematography and use of black&white and color. This is described well in the book, but the visual medium of film really brought this to life. I do think they could've done even more with that, although I think they were trying to stay true to the book here. I was also hoping for more of an emotional impact from certain scenes between the Giver and the Receiver in the film. Some of those scenes in the book are brutal and really broke my heart for Jonas. It didn't have quite the same impact for me in the film – perhaps because the character was older.The ending of the book disappointed me but the film managed to deliver a very similar ending in a way that stayed true to the book while also providing a greater sense of closure. Where I think the book meandered into allegory, the movie developed the plot and made a more compelling story overall, even if some of the 'science' of how all this was possible is dubious at best.A major highlight from the film for me was seeing the usually uber sexy and seductive Alexander Skarsgård playing a nurturing father figure who worked in the nursery with newborns while his wife – played by the petite Katie Holmes – was involved in politics. Seeing 6'4 Eric Northman – sorry, Alex Skarsgård – so tenderly caring for tiny babies really highlighted the gender dynamics and theme of equality in the book. It was a very clever casting choice.Overall, this movie was fine but not amazing. Given the source material and how beloved this story is I felt they could've done much more with it.",The Giver
156,diane_berger,Great movie! Give it a try and you'll see what I mean,10,11 September 2014,"OK, I am not the great movie critic of all times, I do not pass my time reading James Joyce or any other eclectic writers... I am not that fond of things people do not understand, but that make the wonder of those who want to seem ""cultivated"" and ""knowledgeable"". This is a great movie. Yeah, I admit, I haven't read the book, so what?! Is the movie supposed to be seen only by those who have read the book and to be 100% faithful to everything that appears in the book?! Well, I do not think so, since otherwise it would be meant to fail in the box office? (All movie goers and viewers are not supposed to be great book ""freaks"", are they?! If it were the case, I wonder how many of the movies that were successful in terms of getting a high audience would have made it... Not many, I am providing the answer for those that might still be looking for it ;-)). The movie stands in the rank of other great successes like ""Gattaca"". It is a good, solid movie, with great performances (veterans like Meryl Streep or Jeff Bridges don't need more supportive talk, I guess that only by seeing their names on the screen you'll get a glimpse of what they are going to deliver in terms of performances), but also with good parts, well played by younger actors(the lead part, just as well as those delivered by the supporting roles). It is a movie that manages to touch you, to make you think and which has the rare quality of staying with you even afterward. I give ""The Giver"" the credit of becoming a classic.

We had never heard of the Author Lois Lowry or any or the books in the four part series however we were certainly surprised by the concept of the story and of the possibilities for mankind.Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep gave a performance of what you would expect from them and all the supporting actors produced performances to keep the movie going in ""What is going to happen next"" kind of way,we felt entertained for 97 minutes and had our minds provoked into thinking of what the future might hold for humanity.""The Giver"" is not a film for everyone as it offers a different style of visual effect and is not a full on Action movie however if you like Futuristic concepts you will enjoy it.On The Plus Side: No Sex, No Gratuitous Violence and no Horror, take a 10 year old plus to watch it without hesitation. On the Minus Side: We did feel by the end of the movie the story was rushed a bit, which is why We need a second viewing.I gave this film an 8/10 for its concept and entertainment value, as a guide if you liked Logan's Run (1976) OrDivergent (2014) you will enjoy ""The Giver"" and we hope the movie makers continue with the remaining three stories.",The Giver
162,dreamlife613,"Not bad, but not that good either",6,10 September 2017,"I'll start by saying that I did read the book many years ago in school and thought it was a good book at the time with an interesting, unexpected twist. I never went back to re-read it so while I knew what the gist of the story was, I didn't remember all the details.As a movie, I thought it was just OK. It wasn't bad, but there were several things keeping it from being great. First, the focus was on Jonas and The Giver moreso than any of the other characters, which made it hard to sympathize with the society. The actor playing Jonas was fine, not very memorable though. I would have liked to understand the perspectives of Fiona and Asher rather than just see them the way Jonas does - in broad strokes. The release of memories from The Giver to Jonas could have been shown or explained differently as I did not really understand how that process worked. Were they sharing a psychic link? Was there a chip embedded in their wrists allowing the transfers? Also, sometimes Jonas would see things as if he were living the past memories while other times it was more like he was seeing everything play out like a movie or something. Finally, the ending was not very satisfying. I won't spoil anything but there were things that happened that did not feel realistic or believable at all. The final scene was confusing. I would say if you have nothing else to watch and are interested in a fairly PG story, this is a pretty good one. So many TV and movies are so focused on violence, sex, and darkness that it is kind of nice to have a straight forward movie that makes you think a little in the process of watching it.",The Giver
163,jackgradis,The Giver Review,5,11 August 2014,"I know, I know, that score makes you want to hate on me already. First, let me say that I have read the book and really enjoyed it. It was thought provoking, emotionally engaging, and intelligent. Second, while I enjoyed the book, I am not passionate about it like some people are. So I went into the movie with a completely open mind, just wanting to experience the movie. First, the positives. Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep are fantastic as expected. Both bring wonderful layers to their character. Also, the use of going from black and white to color was used real well to demonstrate what the characters see. The film looks good and is acted well.Now my complaints. First of all, the setup of the supporting characters felt off to me. The society they live in have a certain set of rules that everyone follows because they were taught to their whole lives. But all the characters broke the rules multiple times in the beginning of the film. That takes you out of the overall feeling the movie is supposed to give you, the message it has to offer.Next, while the book got you emotionally attached to Jonas and what is happening to him, the movie falls flat. Their are certain moments that have to have the audience fully involved emotionally, but just don't. That is a big negative unfortunately, because you want to care, but the film is too lazy setting you up for the emotional blow.Finally, the pacing is way off. The middle part with Jonas coming to the realization of what is really going on, is rushed and he makes up his mind like that. That is the most important part of the movie, and sadly it is rushed. Then the movie slows down, and that leads to a VERY anti-climactic ending.Overall, if you are a die hard fan of the book, then obviously you should see it. Who knows, I may be the only one who doesn't drink the coolade for this movie. But the tone and storytelling are to sloppy and the movie fails to get you emotionally attached. So the result is a mediocre film for me. I still recommend you see for yourself, but just ask yourself: Did I love the movie or did I want to love the movie because of the book?",The Giver

I notice some people give away some of the really neat things that happen in the movie and that is a shame. Reminds me of the matrix, a co-worker couldn't wait to wreck it for me by blabbing about how the matrix was really a computer simulation that people need to be woken up from. If my blabbing co-worker had just kept his mouth shut, then I would been able to enjoy that cool moment.

165,graves-michele,Need a fresh view on life? There are better alternatives.,1,4 October 2014,"At first dull and then irritating. If you're looking for a fresh perspective on life there are better alternatives. Try ""Pleasantville"" (1989), Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), ""The Matrix"" (1999) or even ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" (2013) all movies that deliver a similar message in far more entertaining and creative ways. Caveat: I'm not a young adult and I have not read this book (And now am not likely to. I got the strong sense that it may be a lot like Paulo Coelho's much beloved ""The Alchemist"" which struck me as didactic, pedantic and simplistic). Certainly my middle-agedness contributed to my strong sense that I'd seen and heard this stuff before. The film also revealed some shameless carelessness in world-building. Much of this story did not make sense or feel plausible or did not translate well to film or all of the above.Granted Katie Holmes is probably meant to be annoying in this role, but she sure succeeds.

166,lovellallen,Barely watchable,3,17 September 2014,"Watched this movie into parts as i feel asleep during it. but when i woke up i resumed watching it.The film was basically equilibrium with a younger person, and I've only just found out it was based on what was possibly a good book. The film moved to fast i felt there wasn't enough build up, or narrative for the memories that where passed down to be of any effect. and no understanding given of how memories are all in one person. it makes no complete sense that bit, the film makes it seem like they where ordinary people.When watching this film you feel that important bits are missed. Yes we are intelligent people and we can work out things for ourselves, but i wasn't watching a mystery. This was a dramatic dystopian film, without all the feelings of the drama.I feel the actors where all good, given what they were working with.

167,spuzer55,Doesn't work well as a film,5,26 November 2014,"I've read the book and after watching the movie I have to say that it doesn't really work well on screen. The attempted execution is admirable, but the cinematic experience is lacking. Pacing either seems to progress the story too rapidly or get bogged down in long drawn out narration or speeches that don't complement the rhythm of the story well. Characters seems underdeveloped resulting in a lack of concern for them in general and an absence of penetration and depth. You could tell they were trying to appeal to the teen market on the same level as The Hunger Games, but it's not the same when the world you're trying to paint is devoid of normal emotions. I can see this working better if they gave it a more quirky feel from the start or even went over the top stylistically or atmospherically, but as it stands it just didn't turn out to be exciting or thrilling enough to make you want to pay attention. The film offered nothing new both thematically or visually, with better examples of what was on offer being done in more successful and creative ways before; Equilibrium and Pleasantville come to mind. I don't think it really has much for both book fans and casual viewers alike.",The Giver
168,alexgarcia732805,Underdeveloped and Dull. An Implausible and Dumb Utopian Society. Bad CGI. Camera Angles are Awkward. Amateur Acting.,5,9 February 2015,"The Giver reminds me of two other 2014 films, Transcendence and Divergent (both of which I also have reviewed on Metacritic). Why? The Giver is similar to Transcendence because both films took a while to make (of course The Giver was in the process of being made much longer by Jeff Bridges). Both also have good and respected actors---Transcendence has Rebecca Hall, Paul Bettany, Kate Mara, Cillian Murphy, and Morgan Freeman while The Giver has Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Katie Holmes, and Alexander Skarsgard. The Giver is also similar to Divergent because (I don't like to say this, but) both YA novels and their movie adaptations have implausible utopian futures and societies. The world featured in The Giver honestly doesn't make much sense, if you simply base you opinion on the movie. Unlike other novel adaptations, I didn't read The Giver book. I actually made sure I didn't, so that I could have an unbiased opinion. A movie needs to stand on its own. If I need to read a book to understand it and like it, than exactly how good is the movie on its own? So, I just watched the movie. And the world/society that exists in The Giver doesn't really make much sense. Who created ""the community"" where Jonas lives? Why are the Giver and the Receiver the only ones who have knowledge of the past? Exactly how do they even get memories of the past in the first place? If the Elders created Jonas' community, then why don't they have memories of the past? It would be impractical for them to rely on the Giver and the Receiver to tell them advice, because they could lie/deceive/manipulate them. Why does their need to be a Receiver if they already have the Giver? How does the government work? Are the communities entirely self-reliant (because I doubt they are)? Later, I actually read the book and most of the questions above are still not answered. The book gives more answers for sure, but we still don't know much about the world of The Giver. Some scenes in the film look and feel cheaply made, with not-very-good CGI and strange camera angles. The actor playing Jonas feels too amateur; his scenes feel awkward and forced at times. This doesn't only apply to Jonas, but almost all the actors in the film. I feel like all the people who rated ""The Giver"" favorably watched a different movie. ""One of the best films of the year""; ""tremendous acting""; ""amazing actors and awesome scenes""? I feel this praise is unwarranted. ""Worst movie of the year""? Some of the criticism for the movie is unwarranted as well. The movie changed a few things from the book, but I think most of these changes helped make the storytelling more fluid (if also a bit cliché). These changes were done to help the viewers experience, similar to The Maze Runner film. One example of these changes is Asher; lots of things about Asher are changed (he wasn't a pilot, he didn't help Jonas). Also, the romantic aspect of the movie (the relationship between Jonas and Fiona) isn't nearly as prominent of important. Most of the memories giving sequences are just plain montages, and more time should've been given to them and more different memories should've been shown. Considering how long it took for The Giver too finally make it to the big screen, you would've thought the movie would be pretty good. But the movie feels underdeveloped and dull. Despite all The Giver has going for it, it's not that good. I do like the book by Lois Lowry much more though; I have a small paperback copy of it.

169,nymeria-meliae,Let down by the ending,7,19 January 2016,"Overall I enjoyed this film. I would've loved to have seen some of the things brought up in the film explored in greater detail... such as the notion that without words for colour there is no colour... They could've done an entire film just on that idea alone... certainly when we covered this concept at university we spent hours upon hours exploring the power of language in defining our world.Also the critique of community could've been explored much better. The result of the film is that we end up with more of a critique that borders communism rather than communitarianism and as such we get a THX-1138 or 1984 feel of this society. Although in all fairness the book emerged around the same time as Etzioni was redeveloping communitarianism into a means of government and Bauman's critique didn't come out until much later... as such, my guess is that the book was more of a promotion of neo-liberal individualism rather than a proper critique of communitarianism and as such it is understandable how the concept of community comes across as being more about communism and socialism. However, from talking to those who have read the book, there are enough changes in the film to have allowed the screen writer and director to bring the book up to date with more recent history by taking a communitarian critique and possibly weave in some similarities to things said and done during the Blair and Clinton administrations where government was defined in terms of community.Meanwhile, the division of labour based on attributes seems like something taken straight from the Divergent... however, this is one of those cases whereby the films of the books have come out differently to the books - in other words, the book 'The Giver' came out a lot earlier than the book 'Divergent' and as such Divergent has probably borrowed from 'The Giver' rather than the other way around - although, I've not read either books and I am basing my review solely on the film.The acting in the film was quite well done for such young actors. The photography and effects in the film were also well executed. There is also a big morality question over hanging all of this that mirrors that of 'After the Dark' (aka The Philosophers) (2013) concerning whether it is right for a few to die in order the rest to live harmoniously.Although I would've loved to have seen a bit more development of the issues raised in the film (although it might be difficult to do that without making the film an epic in length), the main disappointment to the film was the ending. It made zero sense at all that the way in which to restore feeling was to break through a 'force field' on the edges of society. It would've made much more sense in the case of the film (I believe the book is slightly different) to have had Jonas do something to the injections that we are led to believe in the film were the cause of suppressed emotion (see THX-1138). Escaping to the edge of society seemed like a cheap ending to the film and if anything gave the film the impression that it had just ripped off THX-1138... and yet through the exploration of the power of language, the critique of community, and morality the film had the potential to be so much more than another THX-1138 rip-off.The other major plot hole was the restoration of memory in people who had not experienced those memories. It made no sense whatsoever as to why someone who had not been born before the community was created to experience memories from before the community's creation, just because Jonas had passed through the edge of society. While I think tackling the injection would've been the way to have gone, had there been something at the edge of society that allowed Jonas to invade the consciousness of those within the community in the same way that the Giver shared his memories to Jonas via touch... then that may have solved the problems with the ending... it may be something along those lines in the book (I don't know) but if so, it wasn't very well explained in the film - and once again, it would've been better for Jonas to have discovered that he was able to project memory and feeling to others without the need of touching them as being the catalyst for the providing the community with a collective set of memories and emotions.Overall... I enjoyed the film but felt it was let down by the ending.",The Giver

171,kingsgo4th,I'm not The Receiver or The Giver...I'm The Ruin,2,21 January 2016,"Very sorry to see so much acting talent lost in a mismanaged film that clearly had potential for a place in fantasy/sci-fi cinema history. For once, here was a film (with Digital Tech available) to go where THX 1138, both 1984 films, Fahrenheit 451, Logan's Run, Elysium and so many others missed the proverbial boat on. This is about a future 'take 2 pills and smile' society but what was The Ruin? Nuclear? Chemical? Big brother? What happened? Is there a problem just saying how we as humanity came to this black & white end? Is the audience just supposed to think, 'I guess something bad happened'? How did humanity wind up having all the emotion of unflavored gelatin? So the film bypasses all this and just tells us there was The Ruin. As with Elysium, here was material to make a limited/cable series that instead is a muddled mess. In a future where there is so much technology, why was The Giver's methods not monitored? And then, very little is explained about the The Receiver's brazen escape with the child and how he was outfitted leaping off the boundary and sledding through a winter wonderland and how they later were miraculously outfitted with Land's End. How did his going through some memory portal (barely explained), manage to affect those living in black & white? Giver? Receiver? Give me a break! And by the way, all the best to Meryl, Jeff and Katie (I hope that was make- up that made you look over 50) and the rest of the cast....best of luck in the future...after The Ruin.",The Giver
172,garth-mailman,Thought provoking,9,23 January 2015,"Rarely does the adaptation of a good book result in a great movie. Meet the exception, but then the Bridges Family have been working on this project for 20 years. Do watch the family reading of an early script to see Lloyd, dynastic sire of film royalty do the part of The Giver clad in pajamas and robe with his young grandson the receiver. Son Jeff takes the role of Giver here. Credit them for going outside the family to find a blue-eyed Jonas in the person of Brenton Thwaites, brown-eyed by the way. Those eyes are not in evidence for most of a movie shot in black and white. The movie concentrates on the 12-13-year-old Jonas and his work with the Giver. In so doing in a 98-minute film we do not get the same chance to become immersed in Sameness as we do when reading the book. Nor does the menace of this Orwellian society grip us to the same extent. The horror of the release process is glossed over in a film meant for a G rating. Included is a study guide intended to invoke the moral issues of a managed society.",The Giver

Not only it is very well written, fantastically interpreted and, obviously, directed. I found myself pondering about the difficulties of carrying a life with no sentiments, albeit the injections, simply because the mind is far too powerful to put a lid on it. And I recalled a sentence written in a Spanish book -Paradox- where Jesus converts a cruel man and tells him in the end: ""Of course God does not allow you to forget, if you forgot... how could you forgive?""

Having said that and admitting that I have read extensively in American literature, I found this movie filled with ideas from other authors arraigned in a way used many times before. This is one more example of Hollywood's lack of originality but maybe, just maybe it is the book itself without originality too.Talk about telegraphing the end, this one took about 3 minutes to figure out where it would end and no I wont share it since it is so painfully obvious.There have been several YA movies lately and maybe I am just too old to appreciate them since none of them share much originality having read so many books.

To be more and more precise in language to avoid our true feelings and ideas that keeps us from harm? It is the same idea to prevent others from suffering that keeps humankind away from itself. What keeps us in the dark to a new way of living avoiding what is a part of us: feelings. As if Emotions keeps us from what is good, the colour of life. And so this story we make call it: prophetic. People change words to disguise the true meaning of what is really happening. For example: euthanasia is to kill a person to preserve his or her dignity. To say it different doesn't mean that we aren't acting. The truth is in reality, not in our perspective, to change it is to lie to ourselves.

178,Luna-Phaedra,Most accurate book-to-movie production I've ever seen!,8,7 September 2016,"I'm almost shocked that this movie has a 6.5/10 average rating. Then again, I suppose the majority of audiences didn't read this book in school.I did, and was blown away at the way the movie brought the atmosphere of the book to life. The setting, the society, the philosophy, THE COLOURS! I feel like it added perspective from what I remembered reading 10 or so years ago.Okay, yes, there's not a whole lot of action, a lot of exposition, and a rather awkward exchange between Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges over contrasting philosophies. But, come on, when you look at bungled movie projects like Avatar: The Last Airbender, Queen of the Damned, and Twilight (yes, the books weren't good, but those movies were horrid on several levels), you got to give credit where credit is due. At least The Giver actually TRIED to explain things and filled in the gaps outside of the protagonists' perspective. Book readers always complain that movie adaptations are never like the book. This is one of those few times where we got exactly what we asked for.In summation, if I had to judge it on accuracy, I'd give it a 9.5 out of 10.

179,kenburke0627,Getting it on with The Giver,7,29 May 2017,"I will admit that there several similarities with The Giver and Divergent. Both films involve ""too good to be true"" dystopian societies, both films involve adolescent protagonists that feel they are somehow ""different"", both films have a ceremony where teenagers have their futures determined, both films even have a cold-as-ice matriarch type calling the shots. These similarities (and some others) turned people off to the Giver. That is disappointing, because the Giver, despite its wearing Divergent-style clothing, has its own strengths that make it worth seeing. At first, almost everything is shown in black, white, and various shades of gray. The only exception is when the hero, Jonas, starts to see things differently, in color. Inevitably, this is a sign that he is headed for great things – he is destined to become a ""Receiver of Memory"", his mentor, the ""Giver of Memory"" will instruct his as to the way things were. Of course, the more Jonas learns the more he becomes displeased and eventually disgusted with the world around him. He learns, for example, that the practice of ""releasing"" someone means to kill, usually an infant that does not meet expected physical standards or an elderly person. Much to his horror he sees his father doing so to a baby. When he learns Gabriel, a baby his father had brought home, will be released he flees for his and Gabriel's life. Will Jonas survive? Will Gabriel survive? What will happen? The Giver may not have been a successful movie, but it is still fun. It is exciting, adventurous, there is even a wild racing scene like the Divergent ""flying off the building scene"", another similarity. If you liked Divergent, the Hunger Games, or the 1001 other dystopian future stories and movies floating around you will like The Giver.",The Giver

The changes were not ones that ruined the book. They stayed true enough to the basic story. Hollywood always tries to tell a slightly different story. The only problem I had was before I made it to the theater. One of the trailers gave away the most important moment of the book. I read the book so it did not bother me, but those who haven't read the book might have too much revealed to them if they saw that specific trailer. I wish it were a tad longer. I think they rushed though the ceremonies a bit. I think the viewer needed a little more time to see those to understand how the community was run. Those who read the book were at an advantage. I hope they have deleted scenes and the making of when the movie becomes available for purchase. I thought the effects were effective without being over the top.

183,misha1998,"Underrated, but also faulty",7,17 August 2014,"I think critics did not take a chance with this film. For some reason, I enjoyed the film which I think is very underrated but also faulty.I do have some faults for this movie: A. Some of the movie's content is new for example, there is a ""Boundary of Memory"" which is not part of the book, and I think was used for the clichéd ""good ending"" that I did not think fitted the movie's themes of free choice and authoritarianism. In 1984, which I will spoil the ending for the sake of this review, the protagonist wins the battle against himself. As a matter of fact, the Boundary of Memory does not exist in the book, but I love how they put the ambiguous ending so that Jonas has escaped the Community and yet has died in the eyes of the Community, and in the book, he wonders if he has found Elsewhere.B. I dislike Brandon Thwaites performance as Jonas, and I found Taylor Swift to be cast only because it would add additional revenue.Brandon Thwaites performance as Jonas does not embody the character, he is merley acting because he is doing what he usually does in every other films that he is in. Taylor Swift, I think was cast because the casting decision would add additional revenue, from her fans. What I like about this film: Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep's performance. They were phenomenal in the film, and in the last argument they have before Jonas crosses the boundary, exposes what we all fear; the fact that one day we might have this kind of world.I also like the cinematography. Do not be surprised when the cinematography gets a nomination -- it is beautiful and reminded me of The English Patient for some reason.The film is also elevated because of the messages it protrays; one of which is choice, love and power. This film also could have been edited better because if it was edited better, than it would have been critically acclaimed. I would have removed the extremely unnecessary electronic music playing. In the end, critics overlooked this film because they were expecting a masterpiece that lived up to the original but I am aware of some flaws and if it were not for these flaws, this would have been a great movie.

Mindless action, needless violence, and transforming robots are all absent here. I have a feeling though, that people are smarter than they think.

Movies are almost NEVER as good as a great book. If they are as good as the book, then they have achieved a great accomplishment, and I imagine this movie was at least as good or at least almost as good as the book.I consider this a ""Great!"" movie. Why? It's a great movie because it examines many deep and relevant issues of society and does so in a way that makes us viewers understand the message it was conveying. It's about joy, love, and happiness and how these related to their opposites of sadness, hate, and the pain of living.This movie showed what a mess humans have made of this gift of life, and how a future society chose to erase all feelings of love and joy rather than to allow the sadness and anger and hate and war and violence that normally accompany them.This movie is WAY better than ""Divergent"". ""Divergent"" was boring to me. It was the concept without the feeling. It made me feel nothing. But ""The Giver"" made me FEEL - joy, sadness, pain, anger, love...Jeff Bridges has created a true classic but like some of his other movies they are not appreciated by the masses.

I absolutely loved the book and always imagined it to be a certain way. While some aspects of the film met my expectations in terms of visual delivery and execution of the novel, a lot of it did not. There were many scenes that I would have loved to see but were not included. As a film on its own, I found some of the acting to be lacking in emotions and conviction. I did enjoy Meryl Streep and the Giver, but the rest were very average. Some parts of the film felt slightly rushed, missing out on the true essence and meaning it could have conveyed. I did not feel as indulged in the film as I was in the book. Perhaps this was because I loved the book very much, but I feel it was also because the film lacked passion and depth. The overall message and meaning behind the story was not adequately conveyed as important scenes were not emphasized on and were rushed. Jonas's character development happened too quickly and we could not create a connection with any of the characters in the film. Overall, I found the film to be average.

No. It was a good enough movie in its own right, but there were several gaping plot holes. Like how does a giant force field wall block memories? So, apparently, memories are physical things in this film that a giant electronic barrier can keep out? And why would they need the wall. If the peoples' parents hadn't told them about the previous world, why is the wall necessary. How can memories enter the minds of random people who have never experienced the things? So when the wall is broken, anyone can remember the past even though they have never heard about it before? It's not like they lived in the days before the communities and the ""ruin"". The movie itself says the ruin happened generations and generations before this and all memories of the past have been erased. That doesn't mean they're hiding behind a magical boundary. It means they're gone. The people have been brainwashed. All in all, the movie was OK and the performances of Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep were amazing.",The Giver
189,eaglescout910,Don't Judge a Movie by Its Book,10,2 August 2020,"One thing to consider before watching this film: Lois Lowry, the author of the book it's based off of, genuinely loves this film. In fact she feels like it is better in some ways. If she likes it that much, then it's certainly worthy of being viewed with an open mind.If the book hadn't been written and this movie was the first time this story had been told, it would have at least a 7 or 8 star rating. People are comparing it to the book and their prior expectations too much.Considering this adaptation of less than 2 hours is very impactful, and captures the most important aspects of the book, I think it's a great adaptation.One thing it really takes advantage of is the visuals. The way it utilizes color, black and white, and even faded color to show the story's progression is such a clever idea.Some say the film isn't dark enough. It's exactly what it needs to be for the story to work, especially in the way it shows how horrible things can be without emotion. Could it have been darker? Of course. Would that have made the film better? I don't think it would. This film encourages you to think and apply things to real life. No need to be shown more and more darkness when we can already envision that happening in our own real world.Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep are fantastic in their roles and really help carry the impact of what's happening. In fact, I like the performance of all the main actors. It's challenging to portray characters who only show fleeting feelings rather than lasting emotions, but they were quite successful.Ultimately, I consider this film to be underrated and it has not gotten the respect it deserves due to preconceived ideas from people who read the book. Movies will never capture the same magic of the book they're based off of, but this film is a great representation of the ideas and thoughts presented in the book.",The Giver

What has the human race come to?? I would like to start out by saying my goal and career is to create a movie that will change the world for the better. The movie The Giver, is one of the biggest inspirations to me, for someone has already succeeded at my dream. I read the book in the 6th grade. I think the story in the movie is more realistic and better portrayed, as the point is also made clearer. Anybody who doesn't like the movie because it is not exactly like the book is seriously missing the point. This is just the movie every member of our society should see. I think the message, and even the professionalism of the movie, make this film go right up with Dead Poets Society and American Beauty. This is a beautiful story that is full of life, love, fear, and everything in between. In a world where materialism has become the main reason of living, emotions and even love are removed by a morning injection (to prevent all the scary bad feelings and horrors of the world {""If I never loved, I never would have cried""-Paul Simon}).

I thought Brenton did a fair job at acting, same to Skarsgard and Katie Holmes. But, the storyline was kind of dreadful. When you take normal things in a regular person's life such as love, dance, etc, and turn them into an unknown thing, it becomes extremely awkward to watch and take seriously.

Like some of its characters, the premise hardly ever dares to step beyond. Unlike its premise, however, it not only fails to ignite our imaginations, but at times it almost even tells us not to imagine, and take what it has to offer as is, defeating its own point. Even though it tries to spruce things up with some action scenes that utterly fail to inspire, it never manages to emerge from under the weight of all the wooden performances - a crime for which Meryl Streep is perhaps the guiltiest, despite Jeff Bridges' best efforts in trying to even things out a little.

If they lived in a world where people barely even knew what intimacy was then how would Jonas even know what a kiss is, much less how to? And I can't believe there wasn't any awkwardness. If you're gonna add a kiss scene in this movie, at least make it realistic. I think it would've been reasonable for them to have a connection, but that would be enough. Sometimes less is more.

This movie was very different from the book, which I didn't have too much of a problem with. But the movie felt rushed, and tried too hard to appeal to teens in the whole rush of teen future movies going on now. The movie did have some some good moments, yet it did not live up to the material. The acting was no party, starring may nameless child actors with no talent or ability. Even A-listers such as Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep gave a poor performance. Another problem with the movie is that it couldn't decide what it was. At some parts it was a cheesy romance, at some parts it was a surrealistic sci-fi, and at some parts it tried to be an escape thriller. The movie was a poor excuse of a film, and did not live up to the hype of the classic book. A better movie to watch that is very similar is Equilibrium starring Christian Bale. Equilibrium has a good blend of action, drama, and shows the importance of human emotion. In conclusion, when looking for a movie to watch, The Giver is a great choice to skip.",The Giver
200,minhazhimu,Masterpiece and one of the most philosophical movie I ever watched,10,21 August 2017,"Awesome casting, Great story,Visual effects and color grading is just awesome. The philosophy is the best part I loved about the movie. The importance of human emotions,how killing each other for religion, cultural differences, color will create hatred for them. To save our human civilization we have to accept the differences or perish or wipe out the differences. The film just choose the 3rd option. But without love,emotions, culture,faith,difference we may survive but not as a what truly means to be human.",The Giver
201,rosestoraska,Lackluster and Mundane,2,16 August 2014,"Mundane. . . Uneventful. . . Bland are the three keywords that entered my mind after viewing this well publicized showing of ""The Giver"". The movie itself lost much of its interesting context due to the need to sway from the original storyline of the book. Jeff Bridges gives an excellent performance that provided some interesting viewpoints that kept me from leaving but Meryl Streep's performance was lack luster as her role had nothing much to add that moved anyone or anything. Perhaps if this film landed prior to Hunger Games and a few others it might have produced some emotional sparks for the viewing audience. This is a movie that you should wait and view on Netflex or some other Internet outlet when you need to be entertained and not really stimulated.",The Giver

203,Jxfiles,Give me a better Movie,5,29 March 2016,"A great concept with poor execution and inconsistent acting, The Giver is a frustrating film. It's a film that's both hard to watch and yet hard not to like, at least on some levels. Based on the novel of the same name, the film finds a futuristic society which can either be seen as a utopia, for the less imagined, or rightly a dystopia—where emotions are surprised, conformity rules, and memories lost. One person, the Receiver, is allowed to remember. He is tasked to train his successor, who proves to be vastly changed by what he learns.While I appreciate the themes of the film, and thought some of the world building was adequate—the overall feel of The Giver is stilted and a bit cheesy. I blame this on lackluster direction, there's no real suspense or sense of stakes, and bad acting. There are two main heavy-hitters in The Giver, Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep. Bridges is solid, and Streep is okay. Outside of that, the acting is shallow, devoid of emotion, and uninspired. This is especially true of Brenton Thwaites as Jonas, whose performance is more akin to that of a Disney movie than a major Hollywood production.The film also fails to deliver on what would otherwise be really interesting developments. It just doesn't feel like it got what it could out of good material. By the end it succumbs to profoundly silly plot devices. The sequence involving Jonas and a child and their exploits crossing mountains, snow, and desert, is laughable and indicative of the film's larger failings. Not good.2.5/5 Stars",The Giver
204,krokoschilla,Oh god,1,29 June 2017,"So, I had to watch this movie because of a school project after reading the book and have to say, I was amazed at the awfulness. The effects weren't ... that bad, I have to admit. My biggest complaints are the script and the actors. The book is kinda strange but it has a few very important emotional scenes that were either skipped completely or that were delivered so badly I wanted to chuck my phone at the screen. Okay, you may say that the people in this movie are supposed to have no real emotions and that's fine! But if you deliver these 'emotional' scenes without ever showing a reaction from the one guy having emotions (Thwaites) then that's just idiotic. The movie was chaotic, sometimes we all just sat there and frowned at the screen. There were a few 'twists' in the movie that were painfully obvious even if they didn't happen in the book. The few good (experienced) actors that were in this thing were apparently determined to deliver their worst performance yet. The main characters' (Thwaites and the love-interest) acting was so painful I could barely stand to watch it. Thwaites always had this look of vague awe on his face even if it didn't fit. The love-interest's actress was one of those actresses where they are completely unremarkable. One thing however stood out. Their laughter sounded so fake it hurt!Another major problem I have with this movie is 'the Giver'. Somehow, every scene with him and Thwaites has this sexual vibe going on which is really sickening if you consider the fact Thwaites' supposed to be sixteen in this and 'the Giver's about sixty. It really creeped us all out. In conclusion (because I have to cut this short) it's awful. Don't watch it.",The Giver
205,christinemsky,The Giver,8,28 February 2017,"The story was set in a utopian where there is no grief, no fear, no pain, no loneliness and no difference. Nevertheless, the community is also without memory, emotion, colors and music. Young Jonas was chosen to be ""the giver"". After he learnt all kinds of things absent in the community and knew the past, he understood happiness and love. The naked true of the so-called ""perfect world"" was revealed. Jonas doubted the superficial harmony of his world and decided to make a change. The polysemy of the gist is what I appreciate most of the movie. As far as I am concerned, the story can be analyzed philosophically. Is absolute consistence necessary? What do us humans need to attain ""perfect society""? After watching the film and reading the original novel by Lois Lowry, I learnt more about the significance about emotions, especially love. In the film, the previous giver played by Jeff Bridges left me with the long-lasting memory due to his line – ""Just like music, there's something else you can't see with your eyes. Something that lives deep inside you. Something those morning injections take awaythey remove something Emotions Feelings are just fleeting, on the surface. But emotions, they're very deep, primal. They linger."" To be objective like movie reviewers, there are some bugs about the settings. But as a normal, nonprofessional movie lover, I was emotionally attached and assimilated by this motion picture.",The Giver
206,rahulk-92160,Flawed and unconvincing,5,11 April 2020,"I don't think a 6.5 is an apt rating, To me it should be between 5 and 6.Full marks to the concept per say but a really flawed execution. A picture perfect society seemed like a movie set and didn't really absorbs you inside it. Movie travel from Black and white to color as part of story, that too is not as seamless as I wished.Acting is unconvincing, the protagonist digested comparatively easily some of the shocks which could have caused mild seizure to outright revulsion. The movie talked about pain but it really does not live it and more or less is used as a point rather than range.Climax was dramatic but to be honest by then I was not paying full attention either.To say that movie consist art is a ruse, it does talk about art, I guess all picturesque stuff are not art it's just pleasing to eyes in many frames to put it correctly.The female love interest was eye candy and brought freshness. But I wish movie as a whole should had more soul, could have developed more and may have improvised more to keep it interested. But then I think I was disappointed more coz I expected more. Just go with little expectation and it could be gratifying.",The Giver
207,pareshm,Disappointment; for a promising concept,6,15 August 2014,"The Giver begins on an interesting and promising note. It also maintains to hold the viewers' interest for the first 40-50 minutes. Thereafter though the film loses all the gains and results into a series of illogical and hard to believe sequences. The concept and impact of an emotionless, conflict-free world is not explored in depth. I have not read the original novel but the text must have dug deeper into this. The performances are OK. The set and production values are clearly showing the low-budget and lack imagination. The end is abrupt and although there may be sequels in future, this is probably not the best way to end a franchise film. Overall, The Giver gets off to a good start but loses steam in the middle and never recovers from there.",The Giver

209,bpalmer118,A 14-year old's review of the Giver,10,16 August 2014,"The Giver is a movie that I have seen and incredibly encourage people to watch. I have read the book and may I say the movie made the book look like it was lollipop land. The movie had intense moments that the book didn't the book didn't even come close to describing. For example, while Jonas the main character was taking away the baby in the book he just whisked it away no problem, nobody came between him and the baby, lame(very melodramatic). When the movie started to start the scene where Jonas takes the baby away he first escapes his dwelling. Then comes face to face with his best friend Asher. Here comes the problem for Jonas, he starts having the internal conflict that he doesn't know what to do. He decides that Asher doesn't know any better and that he believes in rules that are not for their own good. While Asher tries to stop Jonah, Jonah punches him in the face. This goes against all the morals that Jonah grew up with. Not only that scene but while in the hospital Jonah grabs the baby while his friend Fiona distracts the guards. This was an epic scene that was intense and kept you the edge on your seat. One more detail that I enjoyed in the movie was that they embraced Jonas's feelings towards Fiona. In the book Jonas's starts having these feelings towards Fiona or as they describe as stirrings. They quickly pushed it away by Jonas taking pills that took them away. Nothing happened between them while in the movie they did. The movie Jonas shows Fiona feelings by telling her to stop taking her injections that take them away. Fiona begins to understand that the elders took these feelings away and replaced them with a bland world that has no meaning. I enjoyed how the movie played out and incredibly enjoyed the fast paced ending when Jonas was racing against the clock to save Fiona. I recommend this movie to everyone. Although people may say that it is like every other sci-fi move ITS NOT!! Its unique, fast paced, exuberating, and lastly it was action packed. This lived up to my expectations and even more. I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND YOU SHOULD TOO!!!!!!!",The Giver
210,pave-mayerl,Visually pleasing shallow nonsense,4,20 September 2014,"It felt like I have seen everything in this film somewhere else already.People live in a synthetic paradise, but it is all a lie, and to make it work they are given drugs to suppress emotions, and society selects a function for everyone, and those who are not useful are killed, mostly when they are still babies.Our hero finds out the truth, and by escaping the area he sets everyone free when he crosses some magical border that causes all his memories to be transmitted to everyone over the air.It could have made an interesting movie anyway, but it felt stale or boring most of the time. No surprises, no twists or turns in the story worth remembering.The music felt like a sticky sweet sugar coating, and in the end I even started to hate it, which rarely happens.What ruined the film for me was that the director and maybe even the writer did not have a clue about what emotions are. As a consequence most of the actors showed a wide spectrum of emotions even when they were supposed to have none. The distinction between ""feelings"" and ""emotion"" the giver makes is complete nonsense.The term ""feeling"" is commonly used to describe when you consciously experience emotion, where in the movie emotions are something ""deep inside"" that is taken away by the daily medication, but somehow the people have still have ""feelings"", which would mean that they consciously experience something that isn't there.The actors must have also been confused by this emotion/feeling nonsense, and it shows.What added to the bore was our hero does not discover much on it's own. Most stuff is just told him. This is as exciting as watching someone going to school.I gave the movie a 4 because it is visually pleasing, has nice sets and is well designed.",The Giver
211,hannahray123,really well-done,9,15 February 2015,"what I really liked about this movie was that it was based on an older book, rather than one written after 2010. This way, by now everyone had read the book, and the chances of someone like me seeing the movie before getting the book for her/his birthday are unlikely. I had read the book in school, when I was younger, and actually liked the movie better. The setup was well done, and acting was great, and the plot was well developed. I love Meryl Streep; what a feisty villain!One small thing that bothered me was society's refusal to give up on the fact that women must ALWAYS, no matter what the situation, look sexy. It is sad to believe that even in a society where hardly any emotions are present, only men can wear proper clothes. The mini- skirts and tank tops worn by the citizens of this society had feminist-me thinking: ""why?""But as I always say, no movie is perfect.

The first half is great, some genius (wEinstein,?) figured out a way to save money by using bland stock footage for half the story. The ending was disappointing. When Guy and starving frostbitten baby show up to cabin in woods after spending several days in the tundra, I was hoping the film would show them enter the cabin into the warmth of Santas loving arms, who proceeds to tell Guy that hes discovered the true spirit of Xmas and is then given a tour of the North Pole by a CG Gingerbread man. Maybe even a sleigh ride with the 3 of them, Guy, starving frost-bitten baby, and CG Gingerman. Overall 10 of 10 until the end.

215,dwsrmwolf,Overall Good Quality Movie,10,18 August 2014,"Overall, The Giver was a good, quality movie. It conveyed an important message: we need the bad in order to appreciate the good. I definitely plan on buying it when it comes out on DVD.First, what I thought wasn't great about the movie: I thought the first little bit of the movie was rushed, as well as another segment later on. I also don't feel that time was conveyed well—almost a year passes from the beginning of the movie to the end, but the movie portrays it as just a few days. As a result of the time warp, we don't properly understand how love develops between the characters. We also don't see enough of Fiona's and Asher's development—they play key parts towards the end, but their actions seem out of the blue.Now, the good of the movie: Above all, this movie conveys what I think is a very important message about needing pain with joy. I also appreciated that they touched on the differences between simply ""a family unit"" and having a real family. The emphasis on love as overarching was also good and appropriate. I appreciated that the movie doesn't show details of the painful memories but still is able to convey a little of the sorrow from them.Again, I think this is a great movie overall. And I left the theater wondering, ""Will we remember? Will we remember that love is worth the price of sorrow?"" I certainly hope we never forget.",The Giver

Most of the actors did a good job though: Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges were up to their best.I don't want to ruin the movie for others by adding spoilers, so I'll just sum up and say that if you have read the book and enjoyed it, don't watch the movie.If you haven't read the book, it is probably OK.

218,spguagli,Big Name Celebrities Give Little In Colorless Adaptation Of Lois Lowry's Award-Winning Novel,3,21 August 2014,"""The Giver"" is loaded with big name celebrities and while Katie Holmes and Taylor Swift may be famous in the entertainment industry, they aren't exactly known for their acting abilities. Meryl Streep may draw die-hard fans to ""The Giver,"" but they will be disappointed with Streep's performance and unavoidably distracted by her awful haircut in the movie. Based on Lois Lowry's award-winning novel, ""The Giver"" proves that A-list names won't deliver A-list performances in a film.Perhaps the most disturbing part of ""The Giver"" is the sexualization of 17-year-old Odeya Rush, who plays Jonas' love interest, Fiona. This young girl is portrayed with pouty lips and bedroom eyes, like a younger, less quirky, version of Mila Kunis, and it felt downright inappropriate.Read the rest of my review here: http://tinyurl.com/pk93e7s",The Giver
219,joavabra,Movie takes away innocence of book,4,31 May 2017,"My class read this book together in sixth grade. Most of the kids enjoyed it quite a bit, actually. It made us all think about how ""perfection"" isn't always perfect. After we finished the book, we were all excited because we were watching the movie together as a class. When the movie first started, I was already disappointed because all of the main characters (Jonas, Fiona, and Asher) seemed a few years older than the ""twelves"" that they are in the book.Honestly this already annoyed me because the book had a lot more innocence solely because they were still just kids. But whatever, only a 1 minor change, right? WRONG. After that, the next day in the movie is already graduation. The first few chapters were all leading up to the graduation in the book, but now in the movie it takes all of getting to know Jonas's character exposition and rushes straight to the graduation without really explaining anything. The rest of the movie was a BORE. In the movie it tries to change it into pretty much everyone hating Jonas and thinking he's some terrible person. But in the book it shows the emotion that Jonas is going through while receiving the memories, instead of focusing on some stupid hero vs. villain plot. Honestly, if I had never read the book I doubt I'd have any idea what was really going on. I don't know, this movie really should have just kept to itself. It's too thought provoking to go to Hollywood. It could've been great, but was instead mediocre.",The Giver

The decision to start the film in Black and White, using colour as part of the later plot (no spoilers!) might have felt like a clever idea in pre-production meetings, but the execution just feels contrived and lame. Very little about the community or the unfolding plot feels either convincing or believable, and as a socio-political metaphor it feels very weak in comparison to ""The Matrix"" or ""Soylent Green"". Even the fairly weak 2004 effort ""The Village"" manages a much more convincing outing along the same lines.",The Giver

226,sfertelmes,The Giver ultimately did some things right and a few more things wrong.,5,5 November 2014,"I would like to start this review by saying two things: 1) I have read The Giver, but it was far too long ago to actually reference, or remember for that matter. 2) I was actually excited for this movie, and resisted rereading the book to give the film a fair chance. 98% of the time, the book IS always better, but I didn't want the classic novel to interfere with my judgment of the movie.Directed by Phillip Noyce and based off the novel of the same name by Lois Lowry, The Giver tells the story of a seemingly perfect futuristic community. There is no war, pain, suffering, emotion, and color of life (more on this later). During an annual ""coming of age""/graduation ceremony, the Chief Elder of the community (Meryl Streep) chooses Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) to be the new receiver of memory, and thus all the pain and pleasure of the ""real"" world, by the Giver (Jeff Bridges). As I watched, I couldn't help but see EXACTLY where Divergent author Veronica Roth received her inspirationEverything from the morning injections, selection of fate in society, borderline totalitarianism, familial problems, to the simple fracture in society screamed The Giver in Divergent, but I digress. Naturally there will be similarities in works of the same genre and subject matter. To be quite frank, The Giver ultimately did some things right and a few more things wrong. I found the casting itself to be interesting. If I were to choose anyone to play The Giver himself, names like Ian McKellen, Michael Gambon and others naturally come to mind. But Jeff Bridges has many features required of The Giver, and his acting skills are more than adept. I think the cover artwork for The Giver always sticks in my head though when I imagine the Giver himself, therefore I would have liked to see Bridges with a longer beard. (Just personal preference!)Brenton Thwaites proved to be an interesting Jonas. I feel as though he has the physical attributes to play the story's lead, but not quite the acting skills yet. As a viewer, I found myself wanting more. More drama (that merited the situation), more fear, more physical expression Thwaites isn't Kristen Stewart (Thank goodness). He has more than one emotion, but I would have liked to see these emotions amplified depending the situation. His co-star Odeya Rush, on the other hand, simply could not act in The Giver. Expressions did not land, screams felt forced, and lines landed flatter than a stale pancake. (Oh.. the horror!) It felt at points too that her character Fiona was actually TRYING to be uninteresting. But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts, she's cheer captain and I'm in The Giver. Yes, that's right. Taylor Swift was in The Giver, and the film was actually marketed around her as well. I just find it funny because Swift was maybe in the movie for maybe 8 minutes at most. Granted, her acting in those 8 minutes was better than Odeya's in the entire movie, but that's a discussion for another time. Bear with me now; there is one more actress worth mentioning. Yes, arguably the greatest living actress of our time with 28 Academy nominations was in The Giver: Meryl Streep. Meryl's character isn't nearly as memorable as some of her others and her performance wasn't jaw dropping (as it was never meant to be), but I found the Chief Elder to be the most fascinating aspect in the movie. Her motives felt deceptive, her demeanor always stern, and her hair... Enough said!Phillip Noyce's cinematography was both interesting and poorly executed. Color played a major role throughout The Giver. Although overly obvious and easy, its utilization to show color, depth, complexion and life entering Jonas's world after receiving memories from the Giver was done well. However, when Noyce presented audiences with a memory, either happy or sad, he would create a blur and shaking of the camera that strained both my eyes and the cheesecake in my stomach. After what felt like the sixth time, this poor camera work felt redundant and a weak attempt to make the film feel ""artsy"", which it most certainly was not. There are various aspects of the plot itself that I would have liked to see more of. Scenes between the Giver and Jonas felt short, and their development felt rushed. A few more moments of interaction would have validated a bit of their later relationship in the movie. I also would have liked to see more of Bridges interact with Streep and her council. To be honest, I just wanted to see more of the Giver (and a lot less of Odeya's acting). And side note, I almost fainted when I saw the food that the members of this community ate. Shriveled green beans and what looked like brussel sprout goulash A world without cake is truly a world lacking. I would not want a second helping of that pitiful dinner. Overall, The Giver succeeded in transporting the central theme of the novel onto the big screen. But everything else, regarding tone, development, cinematography, and acting are certainly questionable. GIVEN the choice between The Giver and Divergent, I would choose the former but not without pondering what other films I could watch instead.",The Giver

228,julianakeagle,Simply Satisfactory,7,30 November 2014,"I was very excited to learn that The Giver was being made into a movie as I had read the book in middle school. It was one of the most enjoyable and memorable novel that I had read throughout middle school.Overall, I thought the movie was only satisfactory.The pace of the movie was a little too fast which left a few details unexplained and the characters underdeveloped. However, I thought the cast itself was well chosen and the acting was well done. One thing in particular that was left out was the significance of the rocks that created a triangular formation. It was clear that they were significant but it was never fully explained. This is something even I was uncertain of because it has been a while since I read the book. Another aspect that was inconsistent with the book was the use of color. In the movie he is able to see color in the trees and in Fiona's hair. However, in the novel, Jonas does not notice color for the first time until the red apple when he is with the Giver.Despite these dissatisfying factors, I believe it was worth watching and it certainly didn't ruin my reading of the book. The unique story line helped to keep the movie a success.",The Giver

Even the precious contribution of great names like Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges goes wasted in characters that aren't developed enough throughout the story.3) Story: are you kidding me?I adore SF movies but this is worst than Prometheus, and that's hard to beat as a let-down.",The Giver
231,jeshuasoucy-49314,"A very good film, aside from the simple story",9,3 June 2020,"When I initially watched this film I disliked the way it ended and the simple (slightly overused at this point) story line. Upon re-watching, I was less critical and I truly appreciated the incredible acting, coloring used to move the story, and overall flow of this movie. The movie makes you think a about what it would be like to give up some of what makes us human in order to ""fix"" ourselves. Bad things are bad, butThe movie still is a bit simple and some of the concepts portrayed trip over themselves at times. However this movie is still a very enjoyable movie that may get you to think about humanity a little deeper.Also if you enjoyed the book, I think you will definitely like the movie. It builds on some of the things in the book that were not quite as flushed out as they could have been.Story: 4

232,DiamondOwl88,Why so critical??,8,18 July 2015,"Wow! Actually shocked and how underrated this film is. At first glance of the trailer it looks all hype and no end product. I'll give my honest opinion so here we are. The Giver has a brilliant, insightful and beautiful concept. The film was well cast and thought Helen Mirren and Jeff Bridges played their parts to perfection even Katie Holmes played her part well. The storyline was very clever and at times it was quite tense. It really makes you think about life and death a slightly different way. There's going to be no Oscar nominations but who cares! An all round fantastic film well worth watching. I actually believe that The Giver deserves a little bit of appreciation, I know it's not the Shawshank Redemption so why are critics so quick to rip films like this to pieces. Watch it you won't be disappointed",The Giver
233,diazed-51130,A very good movie,8,31 December 2016,"I read the book when I was in eighth grade and I honestly did not like it as much. Maybe I did not appreciate literature as much as I do now, but the movie did change my attitude towards the story. I really liked the fact that the movie began in black and white because in the story everything is in black and white to achieve a level of equality and therefore perfection and it gives the audience a taste of that. I actually did get exited every time a new color was shown. The book did have very good lessons and the movie did keep a lot of them. I tend to enjoy movies that are not just about cool effects because they leave thoughtless story lines so this is a good movie for people who like creative concepts.",The Giver

236,lalaloggins,Don't listen to the critics and DON'T read the book right before you watch it!,9,4 December 2014,"I was very excited about this movie and anxious they would screw it up. Still, I liked Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep and figured they weren't just in it for the paycheck. I read the reviews and then became hesitant to see it. Was it really as bad as the critics said? .This was and still is my favorite book so expectations were high. I prepared myself for failure and disappointment, but I walked away extremely satisfied. If you loved the book like I did, I think you will enjoy this movie. I would recommended not reading the book again until AFTER you have seen the movie. That way you don't get stuck on the semantics like Jonas' s age. As a child reading the book at, oh 10 or 11 years old, his age did not matter to me. That's not what i remembered. Not what moved me. Not what made me reread this book time and time again. Therefore, I am amazed by how many critics obviously didn't GET the movie. The Giver succeeds on many different levels, including emotionally and visually. It is a stunningly beautiful ode to the power of color. People that complain about the movie rushing through the important stuff, IE more time with characters connecting/ interacting with each other, are nitpicking. The movie by itself is engaging, poignant, and IMO well cast and well acted.It was refreshing to see the kid's cast were virtual unknowns. They play their parts with conviction, portraying both the robotic, relatively thoughtless drones they were to young adults that choose whether or not to trust each other or trust the rules of the world they know no different from. Meryl Streep blew me away. Is she really a ""villain"" as so many have said? Or is she simply enforcing the rules of a society she fears will destroy itself, repeating the mistakes that were made generations ago. Is ignorance and acting out of fear truly the behavior of a villain? She straddles the line nicely. Jeff Bridges carries the sad posture of a man weighted down with the worlds memories, both bad and good. He has the demeanor of one who has seen it all but cannot share his discoveries with anyone. Can't share his joy. Can't share his pain. I think his father would have been better but he died 3 years after his son bought the movie rights. The movie is an obvious labor of love. It is pretty faithful to the book, give or take a few liberties. It is by no means an ACTION film. I scratch my head on wonder when I read reviews that chastise it for turning the book into an action movie. What action? The climactic and ultimately satisfying ending?  *******SPOILER ALERT***********If you felt no relief and exhilaration for Jonas escaping the community and saving little Gabe, then I don't know if you were paying enough attention to this movie. We are a society of people suffering with short attention spans and this is a quiet, albeit powerful movie. It doesn't have the drama and tension and violence of a lot of movies out in theatres now. If you start watching it you have to give yourself over to it. Let the story unfold and slowly draw you in. Pay attention to the subtle way the actors bring their characters to life. Listen to the quiet message it is trying to tell you. Remember what it was like to read this story for the first time and let the movie carry you away.I believe if this movie had been made in the 90's it would have been a raging success. Alas, it took so long to bring it to life, we have become jaded and cynical about it's emotional core, and there are too many dystopian, YA fiction movies out there now it will inevitably be compared to. I think this movie is the type of movie you will either love or hate. If you connected with the book as a child, it will be impossible to be indifferent to the movie. I loved it. But make up your own minds and try not to get too caught up with variations between the book and the movie.",The Giver

238,borab7-907-936610,"Unfaithful to the book, soulless",3,26 October 2014,"I have read the book many years ago, I cannot review this as a standalone movie. As an adaptation, this is a bad movie. Someone read the book and decided it needed to be improved. If you liked the book, if the book left a mark on your soul, the movie will crush your soul.The entire intro, one third of the book, is reduced to a mere 30 seconds of reading and voice-over. Important revelations regarding the Community are either spoiled in the voice-over or merely touched during the movie as if they were insignificant. Some key plot points are completely gone, some are annoyingly different, others weren't even in the book. Pointless ethical discussions are added to give the movie a pseudo-epic feeling. Jonas and his classmates are older, turning it into a teenage movie (They're supposed to be 12, not 18.). Technology is unfaithfully advanced to a point of absurdity. Two of the key characters aren't the way they are described in the book. The ambiguous ending of the book is poorly replicated.Long story short, someone tried to improve the book, and the story lost its soul.",The Giver
239,johanna-ewards,Worse version of Divergent and Hunger games!!,6,23 August 2016,"I gave this movie a really WEAK and hesitant 6! The main plot is good but as many have pointed out, the movie feels rushed. Everything goes to fast, especially for those (including me) who haven't read the book. You don't have the time to get emotionally connected with the characters or understand certain important things of the plot. Absolutely too short and fast film that compresses everything.I know you can't really expect the other actors to be nearly as good as Meryl Streep, Jeff Bridges and Alexander Skarsgård but it's embarrassing how bad the main character, Brenton Thwaites, acting is in this movie. The movie is at times thrilling and captivating. And the main plot is really good, but the implementation is unluckily not near as good. Unfortunately, this makes the film falls flat and becomes in comparison with the Divergent series and Hunger games a poor attempt to imitate these films without really succeeding!!",The Giver
240,Tori-Munro,One of the best movies this year!!!,10,17 August 2014,"Before I went to see this movie I was not all that interested. I was completely wrong, this movie was one of the best movies I have seen this year. The actors in the movie did an amazing job in portraying their characters. The way they flash different scenes from around the world in not only extremely inspirational but I gives you a look at the world from a fir rent point of view. The fact that this movie makes you rethink all the things we have that we take for granite like family, love, life, and in this case even color. The movie was so good I caught myself tearing up at some parts. The only thing that threw me off was the confusing and unclear ending. But since the rest of the movie was so good you move fast that and realize how much you want to see the movie again, and again, and again. So I highly recommend this movie for you to go see.",The Giver
241,jackmatt2,"Not a Sci-Fi, religious propaganda",1,9 November 2014,"I was looking forward to this film and it started well but I was left with nothing but an empty hole in my life that I will never get back. There is something for Christians and the right to life groups with the various subtle references to faith throughout the film but nothing for anyone else with an IQ above 80. The story line was utterly ridiculous and completely unbelievable. It is the kind of thing you would expect the Scientology group would come up with if they were asked to create a movie. On a more positive note, the acting was reasonably well done and the filming and cinematography was all pretty good, however, I would recommend this film to no one.",The Giver
242,roseannjonamaerodriguez-24025,Good build-up. Very disappointing ending.,4,7 January 2016,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. I wouldn't lie; I was moved. Not deeply, but I felt at least some level of emotional attachment to the characters nonetheless. I read the book in 2014 (I think, it could be late 2013 but that's not the point), two years ago, meaning all the post-novel depression has already faded. I didn't notice the immediate strays from the original story - like how they didn't look twelve year-olds at all, or how the Chief Elder had a really important role in the movie but was virtually non-existent in the book - and honestly I couldn't care less about it. I understand that it's nearly impossible to adapt a great book into a great movie and I accept that something will have to be compromised in the process.But what I couldn't accept was how far they strayed from the essence of the story. The love story (although I admit that I entertained the thought of being carried away with it at some point) seemed oddly out of place. That's because it is. Suddenly their friendship appears like a three-way love affair. It was weird and almost unbearable to watch. It's not about Jonas and Fiona, nor was it about the Giver nor Gabe, it was about their society. It was about humanity. If the elder's statement that ""When people have the power to choose, they choose wrong, every single time"" is true or not.Oh, and the ending. When you're in the last chapter and there's still so many questions left unanswered and so many things that you think should happen, so much that you can feel your heart beating inside your chest and your eyes racing across the page. And then it leaves you, drifting in uncertainty. That's the best part of reading a story. Replace that with something 'feel-good' and you have nothing. They took that excitement away. They made it too palatable and too easy to digest, like mashed potato, when in reality it should have been bubblegum.I'm disappointed,. It should be making me think. It should make me question everything I know but here I am ranting about how it didn't do that. And what about people who do not want to read the book? The movie could have at least given them the lingering question on the nature of humanity. But it doesn't even give them that.",The Giver
243,christinariverajaffe,A love Story- that shouldn't be,3,4 July 2016,"This was a very hard movie to watch and review and I'll explain why in a moment. Judging the movie as if I had never read the book, never gave any thought to how much I loved the book and how many years I waited hoping a movie would be made- then it would get 7 stars. It has the very basic concepts of the book, and by this I mean giving someone apple seeds and saying 'here is an apple'. No, its not an apple. Its a very VERY small part of an apple. Now I understand that there are tons of limitations making a book into a movie, one being that there is no constant narrator, and time constraints but come on! The Twilight movie was more related to the book than this was. From the very first scene they set it up to be a love movie, where Jonas had feelings for Fiona and that's just not at all what the book was about! Not to mention that the meds they all took would have prevented them from having those feelings- so that whole scene where he asks his best friend to trust him and was like ""If you were ever my friend you would let me go"". Plainly put he would have been killed. The morning shots kept all of them from feeling any emotion- they are all like Vulcans. All about logic and proper language.I hated that they changed it so that Fiona stopped taking her meds and kissed him. That didn't happen at all in the book, and honestly, I think she would have reported him for even making the suggestion. The movie got so much wrong, not to mention he broke almost every single rule he was given as the Reciever, and I honestly don't think that would have been supported in the type of society they lived in. In a society where everyone is taught to question anything that isn't authority, too many people were scripted to go along with him. The dancing, the 'its not an rhino its an elephant'. It just all disappointed me. They also changed one of the crucial parts of the book which is once you give a memory to someone, it is lost forever to you.",The Giver

246,MovieGeekTonyTee,A bit too cautious,6,2 July 2018,"For me, who already had some years of life behind me, the movie was almost a bit too cautious. I also recognized many aspects of other films :'Pleasantville', 'THX-1138', 'Brazil' and 'The Matrix'. It seemed to me like a lite version of' '1984' or 'Brave new world' in parts. For young people today, however, who do not yet have the background knowledge of the last generation, the film is perhaps a good introduction to ""critical thinking"". In an era where reading books seems to become increasingly unattractive, this may be a good option. But as one of the pre-reviewers wrote, I also noticed the inconsistency of the behaviour of the film characters. Many of the so-called rules have been broken far too often for the characters to be taken from their faithfulness to the rules. And what unfortunately bothered me most was the almost uninterrupted background music. As 'philosophical' entry for young people, the film is okay. For adults there is 'Blade Runner'.",The Giver
247,loriana,Nothing like the book - SPOILER ALERT,1,3 October 2014,"If you expect the film to be anything at all like the book, you will be gravely disappointed! Maybe I would have enjoyed it a little if I had not read the book. But as it is, I suffered every minute of it. This film has completely RUINED a good story and filled it with predictable clichés, like a love story (not in book) an evil leader out to get the main character (not in book) torture of ""The Giver"" (not in book) and to top it off...the wild chase of the main character by his best friend (may I add..NOT in book) They managed to turn a perfectly good story into a boring mainstream Hollywood flick. Why do that? They also made the main character older (probably so that they could include a love story) and they successfully stripped him of all redeeming qualities in order to turn him in to some kind of rash never-think- before-you-act American action hero. This film was just...terrible.",The Giver
248,pi31416,"Good adaptation, entertaining movie",7,17 September 2014,"I write this review from the point of view of someone who read the book before watching the movie, just a few days before watching it. I say this because I think it affects the way you watch a film and your opinion about it.I think it's a good adaptation of the book. Would I have made some things different? Yes. But that's why it's called an adaptation, it's this particular screenwriter and director's adaptation of the book. Mine would be different as it would be anyone's else. I'm not one of those people who doesn't like a movie adaptation if it's not an exact copy of the book.In fact, for me a movie HAS to be different than the book it's based on, because they are different mediums, some things that work on a book do not work on a screen.They made the main characters older, to sell tickets probably, but for me it works better this way. I think it would have been a little weird to see a 12 year old do all the things Jonas does, it works better if he is older, more mature to take certain decisions.I like how they added more romance than the book has. Yes, it's for selling more tickets too, to attract young girls, but again, for me it works, it makes the story more complete. And if the characters in the movie had to be older, to include romance makes sense.The rest of little changes... like Jonas' friends having different jobs than in the book, it's not really that important, and I see the reason why it was chosen to make those changes, unlike in other movie adaptations where things are changed without any apparent reason. Having Fiona taking care of the babies makes the final scenes possible, just as having Asher being a pilot adds action and suspense and the end. And the movie needs to have more action at the end than the book had or it would have been quite boring. It is already boring at some points, or maybe it was just that way for me because I already knew the story. Anyway, it would have been ever shorter and more boring without adding all that action at the end.So, in my opinion, as an adaptation was quite good because it didn't change the real story and spirit of the book, or the real important aspects of the characters (maybe with the exception of Asher, Jonas' mother and the Elders' chief). The only thing I didn't like was how the first third part of the book was compressed in like 15 minutes of the movie. It felt rushed for a person who knows the story, so I kept thinking how those who haven't read the book would understand everything. But that's something I ask myself with most book adaptations anyway.Maybe it would have been better to make the movie a little longer, after all it's just one hour and a half long! Then the first part of the book could have been would have more time and it would have felt less rushed. And not only the beginning, the scenes where the Giver gives Jonas the memories felt kind of rushed too. And the editing between those scenes and the ones that take place in Jonas' dwelling was too fast. Like: cut memories, cut dwelling, cut memories, cut dwelling.As a movie, if we forget about the book, I wouldn't say it's a bad movie, but it wasn't great either. It was enjoyable, with good acting, good visuals and especial effects and it's a good story, with great message. But I feel it could have been better, maybe if it wouldn't have been so rushed, if the characters would have had more time to develop, and the audience would have been giver more time to know the and connect with them. If there would have been more time and scenes to let the audience think about that message, about the question this story opens: is it better to live in a world in peace but without emotions or it is better to let people choose even if that means we make the wrong choices? And who decides a choice is right or wrong anyway?I guess my point is: the movie felt superficial. Which is a pity because the story has the potential to be more, to be deeper.But still, it was great to see the book come to life, all the places it describes, the contrast between the black and white world and the world with colors and the characters. The casting was spot on, even if some of them were probably cast because of their fame more than anything else, but still, overall it worked.I've seen much worse book adaptations, especially lately, so I'm quite happy this one wasn't a total let-down.",The Giver
249,imoviefreak,A rushed movie,6,21 September 2014,"In a decade full of movies which present a cold perspective of the future, The Giver stands out because of its attempt to focus on the lost feelings of humanity.The 97 minutes are not enough to create a story that develops logically.Also,we are led to believe this is an over the top highly-secured society, however Jonas's discoveries of the truth are only discovered when it is too late.The characters are not bad, but not good either.I did not find myself rooting for the main character, but I did enjoy Meryl Streep's and Jeff Bridges's performances.The movie is watchable and it definitely sends a powerful message, but in a couple of days it becomes nothing but a forgettable film.",The Giver

I've heard the book is good. If so - this movie doesn't do it any justice. Synopsis is shallow and predictable, bland dialogs and lots of sentimental clichés. I could not find any advantages. Set design gives the impression of a cardboard mock-up and shots are completely uninteresting and flat. I am unpleasantly surprised and very disappointed. I'm sorry about that, because in the movie, took part actors whom I like and respect. Due to the hopeless scenario neither Jeff Bridges nor Meryl Streep did not have a chance to create a deeper characters. I don't recommend it.",The Giver
253,stina156,It lacked intelligence,3,14 September 2014,"The text of The Giver moved mysteriously. The way author Lois Lowry writes left every page with an unanswered question and slowly, she added and added more content which answered some of those but left many up to critical thought. It allowed the book to be a hands on and beautiful experience which would be different for each reader. The movie lacked mystery, not because I knew what was coming but because everything was laid out, all of the themes and points were thrust upon the audience clearly as if the makers were afraid we'd misunderstand the content. They couldn't do this without changing quite a bit and shifting the sense of ""love"" to a more recognized romantic sort of way while in the book non-familial love wasn't present. They dramatized everything, changed asher, to make the story more exciting but the story is Well Loved, they didn't need to, the reality of the text holds enough excitement that in its honesty, it could have done just as well at the movies. I'd also like to add that they altered the definition of sameness. A variant of skin colors had been filtered into one but I saw that as a multiracial society of racially ambiguous brunettes with brown eyes, then the few outliers with blue eyes being Jonas, The Giver, and some child who was vaguely mentioned. So many people had blue eyes and Jonas did not. It was just a world with white people rather than a world where everyone mostly looked the same, taking away that essence from the story. I guess Hollywood saw it differently...There's more that could be compared but I don't want to spoil it. The movie was okay, the acting was fair for the direction the script was pointing but the script was pointed in the wrong direction.",The Giver
254,mmweaver13,"Short movie, but simply amazing! Adds further depth and closure not given in the book.",10,30 August 2014,"Everyone is judging this movie based on its accuracy to the book, which is understandable. I re-read the book 2 days ago, so it would be fresh in my head before viewing the movie for the first time. I absolutely love the book, and I had heard varying opinions about the movie (mostly negative), but I wanted to watch it with an open mind and present my own opinion. I must say: this movie is simply amazing. Firstly, the acting is top-notch: Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges were perfect of course, but Brenton Thwaites and Odeya Rush also brought depth to their characters. I loved seeing Taylor Swift make an appearance in the film, and she gave life to a character who was only mentioned in the book. Katie Holmes and Alexander Skarsgård showed flawless acting in their supporting roles as well. The movie excelled in more than just its acting. There were so many powerful ""chilling"" moments, particularly with the portrayal of the memories. The contrast of the sensory-rich memories of the past with the colorless and boring Utopian community is what brought real depth to the film. My favorite aspect was the slow transition from black-and-white to vivid colors. My only true complaint about the movie is that it was too short. I didn't want it to end. As far as staying true to the book, there were minor changes, such as the ages of the characters and the career assignments, but these made sense. People must understand that when a book is adapted on screen, there are certain things that must change for viewing continuity purposes. I will say that, as always, the characterization was better in the book, and I was able to form a connection with the characters quicker with a written description. The movie jumped right into the plot, which was good for the pacing of the story, but this meant it took longer to really understand the characters. Having already read the book, this was not a problem for me. The overall themes and concepts (such as sameness, colors, emotion, and love), were portrayed ingeniously throughout the movie. As much as I love the amazing use of imagery in the book, being able to actually visualize the transition from a dull community to a vivid, colorful world was breathtaking. Also, without giving spoilers, the movie gives explanations to concepts in the book, especially with the ""memory boundary"" that separates the society from Elsewhere. The movie doesn't stray from the book, it just provides more clarity. Finally, I loved the ending of the movie. It gives more closure, and was even more satisfying than the book was. My overall conclusion is that this movie serves as an excellent counterpart to the book. The detailed characterization of the book and the sensory stimulating scenes in the film complement each other nicely to make one cohesive, stunning, and powerful story.",The Giver
255,spell-for-ireland,Please stay at home and read the book.,4,20 September 2014,"Alright, let me start by saying I haven't actually seen it yet. But let me tell you (if you bother to keep reading) why I probably won't watch it. I read a lot of books that get turned into movies, and it's generally not good and I regret watching it. But I still do - I like giving movies a chance.But for me, the Giver is different. This book led me into the dystopian genre. It was my rite of passage, from child to teen. And I see the summaries and the trailers and the cast list and I just can't see how they're going to really capture the essence of this amazing story.For one thing, the film is in colour. I'm not giving anything away (I think) when I say that this is not true to the book. The actors are teenagers. What made this book so great to me was that the characters are children. 11 years old. Jonas is supposed to be innocent - naive. He is very literal and very precise in what he does. He is unquestioning in his trust - like a child. He hasn't hit his rebellious teenage stage yet. And why is there a girl on the cover?? Are they trying to turn this into yet another action/romance, rather than focusing on the larger message - an attempt at perfection through corruption of the human? Again, the children are supposed to be eleven!Also, movies don't seem to be able to tell you a story without immediately giving everything away. The Giver was written so wonderfully because you only understood the dark nature of the world much later into the story. Well I did. It was my first foray into dystopian fiction and it represented the broadening of my mind. Nowadays everyone's a sceptic and they'll all watch and complain about how they saw everything coming. But for me, the book was a shock. I was surprised at how dark this seeming paradise was.I'm getting very disheartened with dystopian films. I will continue to read the books, always, but I think I'll step away from the film industry on this one.I'll finish with this. Natalie Babbitt reviewed Lowry's book, saying ""The story has been told before in a variety of forms — Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 comes to mind — but not, to my knowledge, for children."" The book is written for children, or young teens, and it uses children to send this warning about society, which gives it a whole new perspective. A child thinks differently. The way teenagers are depicted in films (especially as they are acted by adults now) can not ever hope to accurately capture the real message.",The Giver
256,joshua-mehaffey,Read the book,9,31 October 2014,"I gave this movie a 9/10 for a simple reason it was very good, with few flaws that are easily fixed. I see people that don't understand the story. That say its unoriginal and then go on to compare it to Divergent or Equilibrium. Only reason for this is they haven't read the book. The giver came long before either Divergent(book or movie) or Equilibrium. It has been awhile, but this is close to how I envisioned the book.Of the two things I found lacking in the story were development of story for The Giver and the connection between Jonas and Fiona. Also a big part of the story is how much time goes by. It seems like a few days to the viewers, but in fact was a hole year. This could help with the development of story's. This is what happens when books are made into movies, they rush everything to much. Another thing I found wrong was the way they made the memory's go away it was not an injection in the book.All in all I enjoyed it and understood it more then most. I bet the critics didn't read the book either. I wanted Jonas to succeed, I was anxious to see If Fiona were to die. It was a little obvious that he would find the house, but If you haven't read the book do not say this is ""unoriginal"" or that it is a poor version of another movie. As those movies and books were most likely based off of this book. Just took it longer to become a movie.",The Giver
257,kontonachomika,better watch youtube,1,10 September 2014,"are the current movie directors, producers, writers and all other people involved into creative part of making movies/writing books really that empty inside, unimaginative, lacking of any taste in recognizing a good story? Even worse, are WE such ??? The movie is at it's best moments compilation of ""best of youtube"" short captions (very best ones i admit) and thats all good i can say about the movie (beside descent acting). The plot, the action, the nuisance, or a reason to give it more thought longer than past the final credits, you won't get from it. It's flat, boring, kind of a copy of that other teenager movie that was released recently that seemed almost identical to this one, of which the name i don't even remember and don't bother to check it on another tab of my browser (this is how worthless i consider it). they should make a movie from time to time about how story tellers burn out and serve such a timewaster, and marketing guys, and critics (possibly lobbied (you noticed how i used work ""lobbied"", yes that a nice word, politically correct;)- otherwise how such movie could get graded over 3/10).1.5hour of my life i'll never get back.just go watch something you've already seen before, let it be LOTR, Tears of the sun, Married with Children episode, or just take nice evening walk, you'll at least have a chance to enjoy the time, not like i had with this ... moving picture. its all you can call it",The Giver
258,andrew-t-ainscough,A Gem,10,10 February 2015,"A lot of movies of the day are more about the thrill and less about the message. The opposite is true of this movie. This movie is all about opening ones mind to love and togetherness; To the idea that the human race is a collective family of individuals; with unique and special traits, thoughts, religions, and emotions. People should be open to the idea that this movie is meant for the viewer to open their own mind into trying to understand others life's. This movie has a fantastic message and is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Now for those who have read the book, there may be room for leaving a lower star ranking based on the artist of the film being unable to translate the book into the full length film, but as far as the message of the film, I cannot see a reason that a lower ranking then 10 should be applied.",The Giver
259,peace-delaney,If you read the book don't see the movie,5,13 September 2014,"okay, so the movie wasn't that bad.. But they changed SO MANY THINGS. For example, Jonas (and his friends Asher and Fiona) were supposed to be twelve. And his younger sister, Lily, was supposed to be 8. That was just the beginning of the changes. Lots of things were added to the movie that simply weren't there in the book, like the one unnamed elder that kept popping up everywhere. In the book the elders are never personally talked to or referenced, at least that's what I recall. (And considering I read the book the day I saw the movie, I think my memory serves me correctly.) The movie also added romance between Fiona and Jonas, which I can admit was really adorable but not necessary if they had simply stuck to the original storyline. They changed the jobs of both Fiona and Asher, who were respectively supposed to be working for the old and working in recreation. But don't worry, there are some unmistakable lines straight from the book in the movie, such as the beginning, ending, and at the ceremony of the twelve. Overall, if you've read the book and are particular about the details as I am, I do not recommend seeing this movie in theaters",The Giver
260,lordwerther,Great in pictures - poor in story,4,10 January 2017,"1. How close it is to the book. a) message I have just read the book and loved the idea that it's inspiring you to think about society. You are animated in the book to think about its goals and values. You aren't given the answer as you may come to either solution. The movie is giving you an opinion and doesn't get tired to tell it to you at several points of it but also at the whole conclusion of the movie. The settlement was somewhere on a mountain or sky instead on the ground.b) story progress The story is different by including a love story, violence and other things2. The movie as such I enjoyed the idea to have everything set in black and white unless it is a scene with people who can see everything. I enjoyed the imagination used in the setting and Jeff Bridges does everything to look brilliant.However, Meryl Streep just seemed lost. Her character has clearly a concept for emotions, lies and betrayal but she is only showing it in her acting by times. The ending doesn't make sense at all. I don't want to provide spoilers to explain it further. 3. Conclusion If you want to see a beautiful movie with interesting backstory you will enjoy the most of the movie. However, the last 30 minutes aren't really worth your time as the poor acting and script from that time on couldn't convince me to see a sequel if ever made by the same author.",The Giver
261,yakuzaiam,My thoughts,5,31 August 2014,"In the sixth grade, I, along with all the other students, read this book. Much to my surprise, it quickly became a favorite. In fact, it is still one of my favorite books. With that being said, I sat down in the theater with low expectations for this film. A huge chunk of the book was cut out, of course this is understandable. No one wants to sit through a 7 hour long film, which unless the book is cut up, it would have been. It was rather disappointing, to say the least. I have no intention on bashing this film, however I feel as though some things just should not have been added. I won't mention what, to dodge any spoiler, but it added a kind of typical Hollywood drama feel to the film. To me, it feels as though they took what was a very good book and turned it into a very cheesy movie. Don't get me wrong, the movie was NOT horrible. There were moments in which they did the book justice. Even moments that seemed to add to the book. To conclude this, my opinion is, although quite bland, the book was better than the movie.",The Giver
262,ecw0647,Missed the target,4,1 September 2014,"I have not read the book, so I went into the movie with few preconceptions. Certainly an interesting concept, a society that sought to eliminate differences, pain, hate, war, lies, conflict, etc., but at the cost of emotion and love, music, beauty and and ""color."" Shades of ""Brave New World."" Citizens are constantly surveyed and recorded for hints of deception and they take daily injections to eliminate all emotion. Babies who don't thrive are eliminated, there is no crime, etc. It's a form of imposed utopia.The Giver/Receiver (Jeff Bridges) is the keeper of Memory ( Knowledge) and he hopes, following the death of his daughter, Rosemary, a previous receiver, who couldn't handle the pain of knowledge and who had to be ""sent elsewhere, a euphemism for death, that Jonas will lead them away from their current bland existence. The Elders are led by Meryl Streep who seems to be the only one with any kind of power. She and Bridges seem locked in a battle for control over the future of the society; she wanted to maintain the status quo; he wishing to release the power of love and pain. (One disconnect I found was that when Jonas steals Gabriel, a baby he feels a connection for and thinks might be a future receiver, Meryl manages to send out a bunch of cops to get him. Why are there cops in a perfect world?)The movie would have been much stronger had they not descended into the traditional chase scene and instead had amplified the valid differences in points of view between The Receiver and the Elders. They started doing that by having Jonas tell Fiona to fake getting her injections and she begins to feel emotions. Had Jonas done more of that within the community instead of the silly wave that releases emotions in the society all of a sudden (and just before Fiona gets put down) the natural conflict between those who feel order is the highest emotion and those who value the pain of love, the color of emotional experience, it would have resonated more with me. The irony, for me, was that both Bridges and Streep are imposing their version of what society should be with little choice on the part of everyone else. What gives either of them the right to determine the future for anyone else?But the worst moment was at the very end when Jonas approaches the cabin, in the winter, carrying a baby named Gabriel, and they are singing Silent Night inside. Ridiculous, mawkish, religious symbolism, that was totally out of character for the movie and lost a star.",The Giver
263,kenziebaxter1313,Amazing. Definitely worth it. (there would be a lot more exclamation points if it were aloud...),10,13 September 2014,"This movie is perfect and may be the best movie in the world, not even joking. The characters had brilliant development. Most people would be critical about the fact that it wasn't exactly like the book. Well, in this case, being exactly like the book would have not worked. There are elements to the book that would not have made a good visual if it had no changes. The changes were indeed necessary. I loved that they provided a love story that was real and definitely not anything like a Bella and Edward story. The feelings were real, the affect it had was amazing. I literally can say it made me look at life differently and appreciate my freedom of choice more. I would definitely say that this was a feel good movie, but I don't mean that like a chick flick or a sappy love story. I mean it like you come out of it feeling happy, feeling lucky, feeling alive. I LOVED LOVED LOVED the whole thing! I honestly can't find a single negative criticism of this movie other than a few casting choices of miner characters. I would DEFINITELY recommend this movie to EVERYONE! A few things are a little dark, but the message behind it is interesting and causes you to think about life in a different way. I would say that if you enjoy the deeper message of a movie, you will love this movie. I am honestly so impressed that the only thing I can think of is how much I loved it. SEE THIS MOVIE NOW! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!I had previously thought that society today would appreciate a movie like this, but apparently it seems to be (still) ahead of it's time. It is a brilliant, thought provoking movie that I had hoped would fit the intellectual level of the viewers, but apparently not. I loved it, and if you are intelligent and love movies, you should too. It wasn't exactly like the book, but it was altered in a way that was needed. Movies, being a visual story, can't be exactly like the books. They need something more. I liked that it was still true to the story line and got the points across. DON'T LISTEN TO THE HATERS!!

As for Meryl Streep, I think she did his role well although this is a different film and not its role to highlight the way she deserves.

The detrimental effect of this shift in consciousness becomes very obvious, taking away and controlling human emotion has led to a zombie like mass population we see today, which, is mirrored in this film.I really cannot say anymore without spoiling the film other than watch it with an open mind and heart, think of every single living being on this planet before you watch this film. Think about whats happening to society today and how close we are to becoming the society that exists within The Giver, with, an end that could be so easy as, thinking outside the box.If you are anything of a human being and watch this film with my instructions in mind I can %110 guarantee not only your satisfaction but your every heart string pulled in directions I believe another film will struggle to ever pull in again.

270,morpheas-01270,What a load of insipid garbage!,2,15 January 2018,"First of all, I just want to say, I went into this film knowing absolutely nothing about it, without even having watched the official trailer, only the very first 1 and a half minutes of the film, which caught my attention so I decided to go ahead and watch it.
Also, this is my very first review on IMDB, I do not normally do this, but this movie is....special (not in a good way).Now that this is out of the way, let me begin:
The movie starts well, with a good premise, that looks remarkably similar to that of Equilibrium (which is an amazing film and vastly superior to this one) which precedes this movie. One can wonder (I certainly asked myself that) if The Giver simply copy pasted Equilibrium's premise, but anyway, I digress.
So far so good, I thought.
 However, the movie quickly becomes more and more nonsensical, to the point where I genuinely felt that my intelligence is downright insulted.
It kept getting worse and worse, to the point where I wanted to stop watching and start cursing at the film's screenwriters. 
How did this script got approved and went into production is just beyond me.
But what do I mean exaclty? 
Well allow me to be specific:(This is where the spoilers begin, reader beware) -Basically, the premise of the film is that in the future, in a sort of post-modern era, people have decided to create a hyper peaceful society where there is no war, conflict, cruelty, suffering, etc for everyone.
So the way to achieve this, is to make everyone not be able to feel, so that they dont get angry, sad, or in anyway malicious. With good emotions come the bad ones, so they decide to eliminate emotion altogether.
They achieve this, by injecting themselves with some substance that has this effect, and they need to take their daily dose, otherwise they will start feeling.
 As I've already said, this is pretty much a carbon copy of Equilibrium's premise,
but I was willing to let that slide. After all, not all movies need to be unique in their premise.
And this is really where the madness begins:
Apparently, along with taking away all emotions, these shots also take away color, and they make everyone see in black and white. Not colorblind, but just see in black and white, as if it were an old colorless movie. Colorblind people can still see some color.
No explanation is given for this, and we are meant to believe that this drug is able to make people see in black and white.
Fine, I can accept that, as a stretch.The giver, somehow is able to hold memories in his head, of things that he never experienced. Those memories were likely experiences of other people, now long dead, but somehow he has those memories because other givers before him, transmitted those memories to him.
That is what he is trying to do now: Transmit those memories to the protagonist, Jonas.
The way to transmit those memories to him, is through.....well magic. 
I am not kidding here. Even though there is no concept of magic in this movie's world, we are left to assume whatever we want, because no explanation is given for this transmittance of memories from one person to another.
The giver simply grabs Jonas' hands, and then Jonas sort of experiences a memory that wasnt his own. 
When he experiences that memory, Jonas also gains knowledge and starts feeling as well.
 How does he magically gain that knowledge? Well the memories are transmitted via magic, so why not knowledge such as words he has never spoken/pronounced. What the hell, if we are gonna make stuff up and offer no explanation, then WHY NOT?? Right?Now, a whole bunch of stuff happens, and I dont want to spoil the movie, but basically Jonas ends up trying to rescue a baby from execution, in order to run away with that baby. While running away, he goes through a lot of different areas.
That baby sure is superhuman, able to withstand conditions even I, a grown man probably couldnt survive in, but somehow the baby does it! By the end of the movie, that baby will have survived:1. Being carried inside a baby basket while the basket is sitting on the front of a motorcycle, doing maneuvers and being driven fast2. Motorcycle doing an insane stunt jump from like 100 meters and then landing, as if it were an expert moto cross bike, and the baby inside the basket being perfectly fine, no harm done.3. Being carried by Jonas while he walks in the desert for endless hours.4. Sleeping in the desert and Jonas feeding it milk one time (that we saw at least)5. Being dropped (again!) from a flying jet, into the water of a river which is a result of a waterfall! A grown man could die/drown from that. Not this baby!6. Being carried (again) to the top of a mountain, with extreme cold and snow everywhere. Seriously, just turn off your brain here, dont think. Its just utterly absurd.7. Being dropped onto the snow in the mountains, laying there for a while, and8. Finally being on a crazy sled ride while the sled along with Jonas carrying 
the baby descends the top of the mountain reaching pretty high speeds.And what is the explanation given for the superhuman baby??
Well, Jonas is having his memory powers transmitted to the baby, and those memory powers also make you tougher. Because thinking happy thoughts about being strong and tough makes one tough!
It makes babies survive extreme conditions, somehow their baby bodies become that of an experienced mountain climber.Sheer, utter nonsense.Also, the giver keeps repeating a whole bunch of nonsense about love, hope and of course Faith.
Faith is placed alongside the other things, as if it is something great.
He tells Jonas to question and not to believe what someone tells him just because he respects them, but then he tells him that faith is a wonderful thing.
So....being gullible and believing things without evidence, even though it goes against logic and reason, just because it just feels so damn good....is a great thing.
But I get it. In a movie where very little makes sense, where little to no explanation is given for things, we are supposed to have faith and just believe whatever feels good to us.And how is Jonas supposed to heroically save the day and make everyone feel and experience love and all that other stuff?
Well, he has to cross the border, and that border is portrayed as some magical shield of some sort (again, no explanation given).
But why does crossing that border make everyone magically feel?
Well, dont question it, its just magic!
Or, its a miracle!
Nobody knows, I'm not even sure the screenwriters know, because they didnt bother with such trivial details!Lastly, the giver knows what is out there, he wants everyone to receive the gift of feeling and be free, he knows how to do that exactly, even knows where the sled is, but damnit he has to wait for the right guy, because....well Jonas just looks cool.
No seriously, the giver could have done everything that Jonas did, even better actually, because he'd do it in secret and even prepare for the short journey so there wouldnt be any risk, especially since no one would find out because they had no reason to be suspicious of him and because they have no cameras in his house.
So....Jonas was completely useless and in fact put his friends and family at risk for no good reason.
Well done Jonas!Or should I say.....well done film producers/writers/director?The mindless drivel that is this film is just staggering.
I found myself looking for an explanation, even going back and rewatching scenes, just in case I missed something....but alas it is really that bad.
I could go on and on about the sheer irrationality and absurd nonsense that is depicted in this film, but I wont.At the end of the day, the only reason I do not give this movie a 1/10 and award it just one star above the lowest score, is because the graphics is pretty good, the sound score is above average, and the actors carry out their roles pretty well, especially Jeff Bridges.
Brendon Thwaites (Jonas) is also excellent, at least within the limitations of his role in this movie.Overall, this movie is a big disappointment, even though I had no expectations at all before watching it.
I wanted to like the movie, I really did. Towards the end, I found myself unable to keep making excuses for it, and genuinely felt that my intelligence is insulted, by this utter nonsense.If you want to just feel things and not think anything, watch this movie, it will appeal to your emotional side, but nothing more.
If you even bother to think even slightly, not only you will be disappointed, but you will often find yourself predicting nearly everything that happens, especially in the extremely predictable ending which is basically shown to the viewer about halfway through the film, so you can avoid any surprises in the film's, terribly predictable ending.",The Giver
271,huoj,Very disappointing,3,4 August 2018,"I saw this movie at school, after having to write an essay on the book, which I did enjoy. While the book had some level of intelligence, the movie fails to capture it.I will give credit where credit's due, because The movie isn't an utter failure. I enjoyed Jeff Bridges' performance as well as the way they play with color. I believe the latter one is particularly interesting because it actually has some significance plot-wise.The biggest problem with this movie is that they completely mess up the characters and what their purpose is in the story. In this world, only two people are actual characters: the Giver and Jonas; they're the only ones who can actually FEEL. Everyone else is essentially an empty slate, which is fine considering the context. 
The movie fails to comprehend this point and gives way to much importance to every other character in the community. 
This movie could have focused on the relationship between the Giver and Jonas, the only characters that should be able to have relations, but they don't do that. Instead, they choose to include a generic love interest that really doesn't add anything and could have not been there at all. 
By over-developing the useless characters, it really hurts our connection to the more important ones.In conclusion, this movie is pretty bad; the pacing is off, the music sucks, the acting was ehh, but most of all, the characters where handled poorly.",The Giver

There were characters that were given much larger roles than the book had, taking focus off of the whole point of the book. Not to mention the fact the teenagers were supposed to be 12 not 16 and there was no love triangle in this book. It was unneeded and unnecessary.There were so many important elements from the book that were missing. If you're a lover of the book you'll be sorely disappointed.

They are told ""given"" (told) what career they will take on after they graduate from high school. One boy is ""chosen""as the current Givers apprentice so that he can assume his responsibilities. It is mostly based on the high school graduates and how a few want to escape the tyranny in which they live. They have to make moral decisions that the government wouldn't approve of. Take risks.

279,jalbitegt,Bad Lois Lowry adaptation,4,14 November 2020,"Where to begin with this movie. First off, the writing here is pretty bland. While the book had a beautiful story, which kind of reminded me of a mix between Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse and Avatar: The Last Airbender, about a boy who has a unique power but doesn't think he's worthy enough, and goes through lots of stress knowing that the power of freedom is in hands, the movie just uses that story and made it as boring and corny as possible. Though, I will admit, it could've been worse. Secondly, the acting is pretty bad. The actors just look so bored when playing their roles. I mean, I can't blame them, the writing's pretty bad. But scenes like the ceremony, the Jonas' actor had such a poker face! In the book, Jonas was devastated when (SPOILERS WITHELD), but in the movie, HA! There was literally no expression. And I don't remember the Giver being so depressing to be around. Thirdly, the editing was pretty good. I liked how they improved on the description of Jonas' community by shooting almost the ENTIRE movie in black-and-white. I didn't know that there was no color until halfway in the book! And also, I liked the camera angles. Fourthly, and the biggest issue in this movie is, the pacing. This movie has HORRID pacing. The movie just goes way too fast for me to handle. I mean, by the fifteen minute mark of the movie, we're already halfway through the book! And this movie is 1 hour and 37 minutes! Overall, I would not recommend this movie. If you want a good Lois Lowry movie adaptation, watch The Willoughbys on Netflix. It is much better.",The Giver
280,marikovalevich,"A world without suffering, devoid of joy.",9,6 February 2021,"The film based on the 1993 young adult novel of the same name by Lois Lowry. First of all I want to say that I haven't read the book. And due to this I will not compare them. I will only appreciate the film, not referring to the events in the book. The Giver is a drama, romance and science fiction. I believe that it has an exciting plot and well-paced script. The stars of this movie are Jeff Bridges (awarded an Academy Award in 2010) and Meryl Streep (Won three Oscars and nine Golden Globes).The action takes place in a world divided into communes. The world is devoid of color, people don't remember about their history and previous way of life. Society follows strict rules and no one asks questions. Without realizing it, people kill premature babies and frail old people by lethal injection. They call the process ""released to Elsewhere"". And only 2 people fully know what real life is: the Receiver of Memory and his apprentice.At the annual distribution ceremony, teenagers who graduated from school were given appointments. The protagonist named Jonas has become the new Receiver of Memory. Brenton Thwaites plays the role and for this film he won the Australian in Film Breakthrough Award in category 'Up-and-coming talent'. Now the fate of the whole world depends on his actions. Whether he can humbly accept the memories or decide to return them to people. But along with this, pain, wars and suffering will return.I would especially like to mention the work with color. I was fascinated by the planned transition from black and white to full color. It's an impressive piece of work, something I've never seen anywhere else. In my opinion you should watch this movie at least once in your life. You may not be ecstatic, but the evening will definitely be well spent.",The Giver
281,kdantica,Good try,4,26 April 2021,"I know that many people like this movie, but If you have ready the original book you see that the movie falls far behind. I am not saying that it was totally awful, and the character´s are played very well, but It was still pretty bad. First off, I find that quite a bit of the movie is rushed, or dosn´t fell right how hard is it to stick with the original? Secondly, the characters arent wrote very well, the actors did their best, but the characters still arent very deep, and you don´t connect with them emotionally with them at all like in the book. Thirdly, they try to dramatize and it as much as possible as to make people think it was better than it was, but the romance and added drama just make it worse.",The Giver
282,raulgarciacele,"I know there is something more, something that has been stolen",9,19 May 2021,"The Giver is an American film directed by Phillip Noyce. Based on the Lois Lowry novel of the same name, set in a perfect post-apocalyptic world, where all the pain and hatred of war has been wiped out.People live in a perfectly designed and controlled society. Each one is assigned at a certain age a profession (Mission) that the community (represented by a group of elders and wise men) considers suitable for their aptitudes and qualities. Jonas (Brenton Thwaites), a young, intelligent, and charismatic teenager, is chosen for a peculiar and secret profession: the receiver of memories. He is trained by an old man named ""The Giver"" (Jeff Bridges), as he preserves all the memories of the previous world, in case the wise men were faced with a problem for which they have no experience. This is how the young man will discover pain, sadness, war, and all the other crude truths that make up our reality by having access to all those other wonderful things that make us human, highlighting among them love and hope. Jonas realizes the absurdity of his society and wonders if it is necessary to eliminate humanity's chaotic, but also beautiful, past in order to create a perfect world.The film uses color, and the absence of it, to show us how the main character begins little by little to awaken from his reality to discover everything that they have eliminated from the perfect world. I find this strategy absolutely fascinating. The criticism I have about the film is that at the beginning it is slow-paced however, it is worth waiting until the end.Not only is it an interesting and captivating story, but it also shows us the importance of our past in building our future. Recommended for lovers of science fiction and dystopian future worlds.",The Giver
283,nygchick,Terrible adaptation,1,6 May 2019,"I teach seventh grade English. I've taught The Giver novel for the last eighteen years. This film is NOT the book, not by a long shot. One of the main theses of the book (perception regarding color) was completely ignored. The main character's best friend was turned into a villain in the movie. The Chief Elder, who appeared in once scene in the book, is also a major villain in the film, and not necessary. The most grievous sin the film commits, however, is aging the main character from twelve years old to eighteen (although the actor looks 25). The horrors that happen to the main character are horrific because the child is twelve. The same events happening to an adult don't hold the same impact.
The producers took forever making this movie. You'd think they'd be faithful to the plot, characters, and themes. Shame on them for ruining a perfect book by changing everything so much, the story is completely different. It would have been simple to make a true adaptation. The producers of this film blew it, big time.",The Giver
284,webber-nl,"Nice setting, makes you realize, very bad ending.",6,12 September 2014,"The movie starts out showing the world of the setting. What the rules are and how its possible to live in peace in there.The story is told through Jonas, a boy who has all 4 attributes. Much like how in other movies he wouldn't fit in one of the 4 categories of workers, and wouldn't fit in.In this movie however he's meant to fit in as one of the ""elders"", who know whats happening in the real world. The elders are tasked to keep the system in place.I wont spoil the rest of the movie.What i really wanted to say was that the setting at first is really nice, even tho there are quite some things that really don't add up (especially about the no-actual-emotion part). The way the story is told (especially the part where giver- meets receiver of memory), makes you realize how peaceful the real world should be and how stress should be so unnecessary. It's kind of hard to describe but if every single person on this planet would watch the movie at the same time, we would have a very peaceful hour after the movie finishes.However, and now comes the worst part:**spoiler alert**While the first 2/3 of the movie was really nice, the closing of the movie where everyone is chasing Jonas, you get a real cheap Harry Potter meets Transporter feel. Where all of a sudden the people who need emotions to make the movie work, have them. People who don't know anything about the outside world, know just enough and don't question anything. Also everyone knows how to drive motorcycles and fly over landscapes that no one inside the system knows of and some semi- elders have to use tazer-sticks to subdue the oldest person in the movie, who did not resist in any way. Lastly, Jonas and a little baby run through the desert, mountains, snow peeks, rocky terrain, fall asleep twice and happen to find a sled. The sled on its turn dodges every single tree on a 2 meter width almost zigzagging terrain with and angle of at least 20 degrees down, hits the outer wall of the dome they're in and the entire dome disappears causing every person inside to see memories they can't possibly have had before. And finally its also Christmas and there's a kids-choir singing holy night, exactly at the point where the sled stopped. I mean, really?This is probably the worst ending i've seen this year.On the bright side, and like i already mentioned, the movie is still worth watching because of the nice setting and inspirational futuristic ideas.",The Giver
285,poppen-1,A Poorly written and filmed rip off of Brave New World,1,17 August 2014,"Really? A rippling wave brings everyone to their senses. Really? This seems to be part of the recent theme of my books and films that warn the youth of the world about how bad adults are and the young can only be saved by banding together and fighting off the aged controllers.The acting by Streep and Bridges was stilted to say the least. The tactic of using black and white, then when an original thought occurs the film creeps in color was interesting. I guess because the acting, overall, was poor the director needed to add a form of 'Did you get that?' to the film.I had a free ticket to see the movie, so didn't lose any money, but was sure glad I didn't pay to see this poorly written, poorly filmed take off of Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World'.",The Giver
286,mofrog1,"I wanted to love it, but...",7,21 August 2014,"Okay, let me first start off by saying that I read the book seven years ago and it changed my entire perspective on life...not even kidding. This story is absolutely incredible, and I was thrilled that it was finally being brought to the big screen. I decided to abandon my expectations since I knew that the film would likely differ from the book. Overall, there weren't too many differences actually. The two key changes are the ages of the characters, which, to my surprise, complemented the original storyline quite well and added a little maturity and complexity to the situation, and the job assignments for two supporting characters: Asher and Fiona.I'm going to state the positives first. The plot, as I stated before, is great...brilliant, actually. The futuristic feel works quite well, being subtle yet still obvious at the same time. The use of color when appropriate with what Jonas is seeing as he progressed though his training is phenomenal. Casting wise, Jeff Bridges steals the show with his portrayal of the caring, yet blunt and mysterious Giver. Brenton Thwaites captures the spirit of Jonas, but I kept getting the feeling that he was playing to the original 12 year old book character. I was also impressed by Katie Holmes, who plays Jonas's brainwashed ""mother,"" and Meryl Streep, who holds a very steady characterization of the supremely stern Chief Elder. I feel like Jeff Bridges could deserve an Oscar nomination, and Meryl Streep will likely be up for some awards too.Here's the bad news - the pacing in this film is atrocious. At the start of the film, it takes only five or ten minutes to get to the first major plot twist: Jonas's placement as Receiver of Memory. You feel completely thrown into the story and only get a small taste of the background and structure of the society that is being portrayed. Suddenly, Jonas starts his training and the pace slows down drastically, only to speed up way to fast by the end. It feels short...way too short. You're left with questions that should have been answered at the start of the movie. Not cool.My other complaint is a lack of connection that the viewer has to the film and its characters, particularly Jonas. Is this due to the pacing problem? Most likely. It was sad though, walking out and immediately returning to my everyday thoughts rather than being stuck on the movie for hours. That was extremely disappointing.I honestly wonder if I would have liked this film more if I hadn't read the book, and as I said before, I tried to keep my reading out of it. I just couldn't help it. The Giver is good, and I wanted to fall in love with it, but I only wound up liking it.",The Giver
287,stefan-alev,The Giver,8,10 July 2015,"When I saw the title I asked myself what we give. When I saw the movie I asked myself what we have given up. The simple and clear message in the movie is what makes it interesting and good. I saw so many simple things explained in such a profound way. Things such as friendship, family, love, emotions, humanity. After all this is a great movie that shows what humanity is all about. What emotions are, how we see the world because of them. About what is right or wrong. What we sacrifice to create one Utopia. We see in this movie the good in people, but we also can see the cruelty that we are capable of. To be completely honest, I saw a little resemblance with another movie. Despite that, It is a movie that I wanted to watch again.",The Giver
288,drajon-671-218054,What a terrible departure from the book,1,13 August 2014,"I shall start this review with the staple comment. I loved the book. This movie is awful. And I don't mean ""they changed a couple of things and now I feel it is true to the original"". I mean, they changed a lot, including the subtext, it has internal inconsistencies, and it is no longer the same story. I couldn't even stay to finish the movie, and below I will state where I departed. For this reason, I give it the score as low as possible. Please don't continue reading if you do not wish to be exposed to the spoilers below. To start things off, what is the first colour that Jonas sees in the book? Red, he sees a red apple. A little bit into the story, after they have described the setting of the community to help people understand what the world is like. A description they have skipped over in the movie, they just show funny shaped houses, funny shaped bikes and a futuristic community. Weird. And Jonas ""always knew he was different"" since he has been seeing green tree leaves... Well, that is a departure from the original. Not ruinous, until he then sees Fiona's hair and gets all moon-eyed at her. The impending love story crushes my hopes. Then, they skip RIGHT to the graduation ceremony and kind of blur over the sheer doldrums of the event, with a witty joke told by the Chief Elder who LIES to them, although she immediately comes clean. So lies aren't allowed except with humorous exceptions... Oh, and Asher the best friend is now a drone pilot, so that will explain how he and Jonas will fight for the girl, even though Asher has no feelings, so the jealousy he keeps showing is... well, impossible, but definitely present. The Giver starts sharing with Jonas (thankfully, the sled is the first memory) they choose to omit the poignant fact that the giving removes the memories from the Giver, so only the new Keeper has them. Then, as Jonas gets more memories, he tries to share them with the girl he is falling in love with... wait, that didn't happen and if it had, as a drone of the society, she would have turned him in. He also shares things with his sister and Gabe sleeps in her room because nobody realizes Jonas can calm him. The Chief Elder sees some of these interactions and becomes paranoid that Jonas is also reacting to the sharing of memories, just like Rosemary (who is now the daughter of the Chief Elder and the Giver). OK, I can go on and on, but I will skip ahead to where I had to leave the theatre. The Chief Elder sends her military police force after Jonas, then after the Keeper, whom they zap with their batons, something that shouldn't be acceptable in their anti- violence and war society and here is about where I left, as the Chief Elder directs Asher to fly a drone after Jonas to ""lose"" him, which seems an odd colloquialism for ""gone elsewhere"" that the story has used to that point. So all in all, the society eschews war, but not the chief elder (somehow), feelings abound even on the feeling dampening drugs the society takes, and people are fine with violence from the military police. Not the story of struggle against a world so absorbed in being the same that feeling and being different are something to hide until one can escape to freedom outside the community. It is now a horrible love story, a horrible love triangle, and a story of a mother who hates the father of the child she lost. What a garbage rendition. They should have let any of the other films with these plots continue to tell them instead of corrupting this story to the point of unrecognizability.",The Giver
289,tcupples36,Follows the book pretty well,7,23 September 2014,"This book is one of my all time favorites. I was drawn to it by the powerful message contained within the text. The movie starts with the beginning of the book. Jonas is skipped and then given the ""honor"" of becoming the receiver. Then the story really does follow the book well. I thought the time lapse worked. Although they could have added a few additional details to the middle of the movie. The detailing at the end, however, makes up for it by giving a better explanation of the novel's finish.I was glad to have read the book before seeing this film. It almost seems like a requirement before watching it. I don't think it would have made as much sense without having read it.",The Giver

Character & Development: The movie develops the characters well in my opinion. I like how the main character is not some celebrity hot shot that we are forced to love based on how they are in real life. Slow to start and nothing is rushed. Of course, it does not follow every detail from the book, but it draws the principles and ideals of it.Art: the style is done very well. Plain and simplistic as most dystopian societies are portrayed. As the movie prolongs, the art in the movie expands more beautifully. Watch the movie if you want to understand what I meant by that. Music: I enjoyed the music of this movie. Gave me chills since I love movies with great background music. Tingles everywhere.",The Giver
291,benkrejci,Awful movie all around,3,17 September 2014,"To preface, I have not read the book, so I am not biased in that regard. This movie was so bland and trite I almost fell asleep by the time it was halfway done. The personalities are shallow and the character arcs are incomplete or nonexistent. I would blame the actors, but didn't really have much to work with given the script. Very disappointing to see Jeff Bridges' talent wasted like this.For the ""memory"" sequences, half the time they used stock footage that looks like it was taken from a go-pro. This was one of many cool ideas that could have contributed positively to the film if it were executed in a more subtle and artful manner. Don't waste your money, see another film.",The Giver

The story line was pretty true to the book and some of the technological changes may have been made to appeal to the teens of today. I love that it began in black and white and colors were revealed slowly, as were emotions. Jonas was true to the book and his revelations were wonderful to watch. The acting was great; both Bridges and Streep are always mesmerizing to watch, and Brendon Thwaite was an equally mesmerizing newcomer. (I read about a rape scene in another review--did I miss something?) Although I don't remember much of the scenery of his journey to elsewhere from the book, I do remember the final scene of Jonas's journey as being very true to Lowry's text--minus the world views which were visually stunning.

294,kamasbro,"Beautifully done film, read more about it below",8,12 September 2014,"""The Giver"" Based on a book (which is said to be better) took concepts from the hunger games as well as the recent movie Divergent this movie puts you in a world of gray, literally. imagine a world without feelings, a world without expression, music, imagine a world where you didn't even know what the color red was, or any color for that matter. Imagine. a world where you didn't know what murder was and did it willing because it was said to be the right thing to do to keep balance. Sort of related to the plot behind Superman's home planet, population control and destiny control. the concept behind this movie is amazing but its been done many many many times, but this one in particular stood out because they took away the power of color. You can't imagine a world without color because its always been around for the entirety of our life, to these people all they saw was gray. And to make it even worse the things they saw were not even gray. they were incapable of seeing color, their minds were unable to process the sweet smell of fresh baked bread, they couldn't experience the beautiful composition of music, they couldn't enjoy pleasure of touch, of dance, of singing. A society without life. injections were taken daily to dull the minds freedom of thought and question, and reality. A very powerful movie that will surely touch you. as for the technicalities, the graphics/CGI were great nothing too flashy to take away from, what was important and nothing too boring to disparage the excitement of the action scenes. Props to the actors as they've done better than some adults i've seen in movies, in terms of expression ,confusion, and emotion. Things that bothered me included:The house at the end of the film, how were they alive. If that was a memory that should have been a very OLD memory, meaning that sled (if someone actually lived there) would NOT have still been sitting there randomly perfectly at the moment he needed it. That would have only been possible if that was not actually a memory but the future which would implement a entire new plot within the story.What in the world was this ""Ruin"" did that mean to say that the world before or basically ""our"" world was the ruin? nobody explains what the ruin was, or is. ever. you just have to assume that it was the normal life before they built this boundary which btw is only a few miles away from a enormous impossibly shaped rock in which their entire city was built on. The ending. it was eh could have been better, also coincides with what i said in the first part which may or may not make the ending make any sense at all. unless the memory was a memory from what was going on inside the head of one of the children from the house. Also who choose these elders? who decided they should be in charge? was there even a process for it? i didn't notice any kids getting a elder position to be trained for.

I've read the book at a very young age, and it was one of those, that just stucks with you for life. I remember the book like the language was simple, but the story was exquisite. The adaptation of the basic storyline was alright. Even if you haven't read the book, everything was understandable. My problem is, because of that picture was just BORING. The thrill of the story, the drama's stages got killed. No tension, no excitement. Also, I really didn't like Jeff Bridge's performance. There is so much more in that character that has been shown. I'm hoping that someone will try to adapt the story to a movie again in the future.",The Giver
296,aladidalife,"Good film for non-readers, slightly disappointing for the book lovers.",7,14 September 2014,"The Giver is my favourite book of all time which is why I set my expectations relatively low for the film knowing all well it would not compare to the book. I was quite pleased with how it came out.My main disappointment for the film was that it was all very rushed. I wanted very much to connect with the characters and feel the building relationships, for example between Jonas, Asher and Fiona. However their involvement seemed very little until the pivotal moments that take place in which it seems their actions are slightly uncharacteristic. Really this 90 minute movie could have run for another 30min and audiences would still have loved and it would have been more effective in connecting them to the characters and the story. However, for the most part the story remained relatively intact and I had no major objections to the adaptations that were made. Of all the movie/book adaptations there are, this is certainly not the worst, but I think with a little more attention given to the timing and detailing this could have been great.",The Giver
297,blakeiris,Better than expected and wonderful adaptation,10,16 August 2014,"I went it to the movie worried that they would change too much for the worse, and how they would handle the very vague ending of the book (to make it something the average movie-goer could digest).I was pleasantly surprised to see they adapted most scenes to be better understood on film. There are many parts of the book that would not translate to film left as they were; they would be boring (for those action lovers) or they would lack the outward dialogue necessary to convey the emotions without words on a page. But the cinematographers need a big pat on the back, because I felt I lost none of that feeling on film.Much of the visual memories and imagery of the environment were adapted to coincide with our current reality. For example, I was not disappointed in the upgrade in technology added to the film. The airplanes were now futuristic drone controlled airships. Very relevant to what is happening in the world today.As a fan of the book (read it in middle school and reference it often in conversation), I would say the changes and additions to characters were welcomed. For example, even though the main character's friends were not so prominent in the book, they played an important role to emphasize the struggle he was going through.My only real disappointment is that some of the character showed too much emotion in their acting, for a society that was supposed to feel none. For example, the mother in the movie could have showed less anger as things escalated, in favor of cold misunderstanding.But really, this is a small thing, for everything else, that I think they did just amazingly well.",The Giver
298,fedoraf,I am flabbergasted,1,5 September 2014,"On a casual cinema night with the usual slim pickings of nowadays, I choose to watch The Giver. I understand it has been inspired by the novel with the same title. In case the novel is great, this is one of those movies that does it no justice. The cast was what attracted me too see it and of course the 7.1 IMDb rating. I do not have enormous expectations from cinema these days. A half decent movie thrills me as we are obviously living the dark ages of cinematography. Yet this movies stunned me in a very very negative way. The poster image is a very honest one. It is unattractive and reminding of a cheap, badly written and acted teen flick...and so is this movie. I can hardly give one star to the story...the only grand inspirational philosophy it shares is that if we don't have tragedy and war we don't have water sports and aerial entertainment...maybe... The whole movie felt interminable and I had the constant feeling it was put together by a bored and untalented team of people coming up with the concept as they shot the movie. Actingwise I can't even express an opinion. Truth is, the whole movie sucked so bad that Even extraordinary acting would have failed in saving it...which was not the case anyway. I am a great fan of sf, fantasy. Love inspiring smart movies that flow on the 1984 theme yet this movie can by most be considered a cheap and confused approach of a distant shade of deep thinking. Just like a precious wisdom gem that traveled from too many mouths to mouths trough too much of time, diluted, distorted, confused, pointless. Might be truly the worst movie I've seen, EVER!

300,EvilMentor,Tones of Equilibrium + Pleasantville,10,4 June 2015,"Having seen both Equilibrium and Pleasantville multiple times it is easy to draw comparisons and see similarities. What it really is the Allegory of The Cave, or at least a similar concept (much like Pleasantville). If you have never heard of such, go look it up. It certainly is an eye opener of a philosophical concept. As for Equilibrium (with the concept of drugs to suppress emotions but not the knowledge of emotions) this film does the concept one better, all of it leading up to a very emotionally impactful ending sequence (which Equilibrium itself is lacking in its entirety). Anyone who does not feel anything positive from the culmination of this film perhaps is having their feelings suppressed. In comparison to the book, this is a story which is translated well to film. After finishing the book I felt nothing for the characters and their predicament. The film achieves in bringing an emotional connection into the narrative where the book does not.",The Giver
301,k-augusthope,The Giver... And Then Some,8,9 December 2014,"I read the book prior to watching this film, and naturally did not expect much in terms of Hollywood appropriately representing the story. However, I was wrong. The Giver movie was an excellent adaptation, though in a different way than you might initially expect.First things first, all the technical aspects were as good as one can expect from a major motion picture (and the budget provided therein). Production value, directing, writing, casting, etc. were all great. As for the accuracy... A bit of back-story, I'm a book purist and like my movies as close to the ink as humanly possible. That said, I was skeptical coming into this film having read some reviews stating how ""grossly inaccurate"" it was. They were incorrect, but not totally. Let me explain.The Giver in-and-of-itself is less than 200 pages long. Certainly, the screenwriters took creative license. However, this was one of the few times that I agreed with 90% of the changes they made. Scenes addressed in the book were taken and developed into subplots, and characters were developed more deeply than they had been, while keeping the original intention intact. The whole story from the book was put into the movie. All the best scenes (important conversations, memories, etc.) were represented very well. Some small technicalities were changed, but were better off I think.In all, you get the whole package and then some. To get the full experience, definitely read the book first. Seeing references made left and right was great, and the movie (as I was extremely pleased to find) quoted VERBATIM many of the conversations and best quotes. Rest assured, book lovers, it was in good hands. Anything which wasn't too clear or anything somewhat illogical in the story was righted and made better in the movie. The Giver movie is one of the best book-to-film adaptations that I've seen, and I give it a solid 8/10. *Spoilers Below*Now for the ENDING. Perhaps the most beautiful thing about the Giver novella was the thought-provoking and ambiguous ending. The ending of the book could go either way as to whether Jonas lived and made it to ""Elswhere"" or died trying. Either way, the memories would be released to the people. I'm of the opinion that he died.In the film, they changed it up a bit. But don't freak out. Jonas is trying to get to ""Elswhere"" which actually has a physical boundary, so it's a more clear goal than what was provided in the book (what with Jonas aimlessly wandering). If he passes this boundary, then all the memories are released back to the people. What they didn't address was the fact that the memories would also be released should he die (which is what happened to Rosemary ten years ago). This kind of pushes the ending to say that he lived. There was one goal, and he attained it *just short of death.* Personally, I would have preferred them to uphold the ambiguity of the book. However, seeing as how the author herself screwed up the book ending by writing some terrible sequels which erased the wonderful conclusion of the Giver, I guess they were continuing in the same vein. So it ends with Jonas probably living. If you were especially stubborn, you could still make a case for his death on a few tricky notes in the movie, but it's not as poetically vague as the book ending.",The Giver

He agreed. They agreed too. So no reason to us to watch film (until it is like Tarkovsky art). I, he and they are hope to get discussion why emotions are so valuable and why memories is essential to human being. You have not find idea discussion in this film. So watching The giver action film is waste of time. It is not have good action. It have not good philosophy base. Even not have interesting love story!

303,dorainer,The book is VERY worthwhile. The movie is disappointing,5,24 May 2018,"I'm not sure if the written tale with its wonderful detail and engaging, thought-provoking story can ever properly translate to the movie screen. I loved the books and wanted to like the movie, but it sorely missed the mark. If I'd not read the books beforehand, based on this adaptation I probably would not be tempted to read them.Give the books a chance, all 4 of them: The Giver, Gathering Blue, The Messenger, and Son. Skip the movie, at least until after reading the quartet. They give the memorable saga a sense of completion that this movie does not.",The Giver
304,simonelatchmie,I thought it was going to be good,1,22 February 2015,"By watching the trailer, I thought it was good. We watched in class after reading the book (it was my second time reading it). I personally thought it was terrible. After we watched it, I threw my chair because they changed it too much. It they stuck to the book it would have been better and I would have given it a better review. The only thing I liked about it is how they created they care center. The only casting they got right was The Giver and some other characters. They got Fiona, Jonas and Asher wrong. I guess Jonas and Fiona were okay but I didn't like Asher. He isn't what I imagined him but they could have done better. They could have done better with everything. Just remember this is my opinion and I am also comparing it to the book so do not thrash me for this review. If you think otherwise, I respect your opinion and through your eyes, it may have been good. Have a good day :)",The Giver
305,quincywheeler-5-322259,An excellent film,10,18 September 2014,"I found the Giver to be a faithful adaptation of the book, as it clearly portrayed the main message of the movie. More importantly, it is an emotionally moving film that makes you appreciate life. I came out of this movie and was thankful that the sky is blue and the grass is green. I have to believe that those who were upset certain parts of the book were not in the movie are unduly prejudiced. As for the montage bits, the footage may not have been exceptionally original, but what footage would have better represented what the filmmakers wanted their audience to see? They were ""memories,"" by definition, things that are familiar to us. I found them moving. And, finally, I think the love story was extremely well-done - there was no love triangle - both understated and sweet.",The Giver
306,ongspxm,Review,7,19 September 2014,"""Imagine there no heaven, no religion too"", John Lennon's song might have described a ""perfect"" world, a community free from conflicts, free from the myriad of negative feelings. But all of this come at a cost, and a rather devastating one. Set in the near future, The Giver, takes place in the ""perfect world"", devoid of all feeling of envy, greed and hatred. The community is viewed as a masterpiece of time. There is zero crimes, zero conflicts, and everything is running as smoothly as planned by the ""chiefs"".The movie itself started out in black and white, an analogy to the lack of feeling and colors in the life of the people. The perfect world comes at the expense of uniformity and full compliance. In the end, the endless spell of humdrum was broken by the Receiver of Memories, the gifted child, chosen to ""inherit"" the truth of humanity, epitomized by the emotions, both fear and joy, that defines us.",The Giver
307,cierra_styles,The Giver Review,10,7 August 2014,"I just watched an early screening of the movie The Giver today and I'd just like to say it was amazing. The transition from the book to the movie was excellent. There were several things that were added to the movie but I honestly think that they helped the people who haven't read the books understand everything a little better. I think that the movie is better than the book only because there was adventure and everything moved quicker than it did in the books. The makers of the movie did not miss out on barely anything and the things that they did they made up for with an alteration. There was humor, romance and a lot of self-discovery in the movie and I personally think the casting was pretty decent although Jonas was 12 in the books. The acting in the movie was great, I really enjoyed myself and highly recommend seeing this movie!",The Giver
308,dhumikar,"bad, but better then divergent",4,15 September 2014,"In opening sequences i was thinking- am i watching this terrible divergent again? no way they made two same equally bad movies)) But no, they didn't, this one is actually better. What made me watch it till the end are those sessions of giver and receiver, during which memories are passed from one to another. The movie itself is another generic childish story about future community where people got rid of this inner beast (desires, passion, lust). They even made everyone see in black and white, just to show their narrow understanding of what equality is.Well so far the only good movie of this kind is Equilibrium (2002). It talks about same things, but without being cheesy and has some good and action scenes. watch it if you haven't seen it.",The Giver
309,HeathJMac,A beautiful film,8,21 September 2014,"Philip Noyce has created a lovely palette with this film. It's gorgeously shot. From the rich monochrome of the community, to the flashes of colour from Jonas's point of view, to the vibrant colours of the memories. I loved the way the landscape gradually changed through the film, it was just stunning. It's a faithful adaptation of the book, Jonas and his friends have been aged up, and as this is a Walden media film, I can see why, some of the themes might be a bit controversial if they'd stayed with the main characters being 12. It doesn't really matter though, the film works very well, and I liked how they increased the roles of Fiona and the chief elder, played by Meryl Streep, in order to make the exposition easier and more cinematic. Lovely film, shame it's been released with almost no fanfare.",The Giver
310,nateapril,Tween version of Logans Run,2,15 August 2014,"I wish The Giver would give me my money back. Made the horrible decision to see this movie without seeing the previews. It was basically just the same old tale again of a rebellious teen that's going to save the world. Jeff Bridges was good in his role but couldn't carry the whole movie, and you could almost tell he didn't want to be there. It could have been an interesting concept of a film, but came up terribly short. Katie Holmes played a bitchy woman very well, even though there's not supposed to be emotional. All I saw in her was moody yes woman. I would rather have waited it for it to come out on TV, not even Blu-Ray, or HBO. But on a Saturday afternoon movie with the old repeats of Mr. Mom.",The Giver
311,peekapickel,Met High Expectations,8,15 August 2014,"""The Giver"" is one of my favorite books, my eighth grade self could feel the emotions of Jonas as he received his first memories, cringe as his friends became unscathed by murder, and in awe as he watched a colorless apple turn red. The movie explores the concept of losing touch with emotion- in a way that was better than I expected. I thought my fantasy of making ""The Giver"" come to life exactly as I had imaged it would take hold and send me wining about how ""I could have made a better movie!"" Well, it did give life to the book, although it was through different ways (like a kiss, the nursery for babies, or a punch)- ways that were more appealing to an audience visually. I do wish the red apple had been the first color to appear- oh well! I was a little sad at not keeping the sense of complete mystery as to what happens to Jonas's town after he crosses the border of memories. Also, frequent flashes of memories distracted me at times (like what am I watching again?), but they did give insight into Jonas's onset of new thoughts- the movie would feel bleak without them. It seems I left the theater believing in the necessity of feeling all emotions, and relieved for the fictional society of no memories having to deal with life itself! A thought-provoking movie I am glad to have seen. After all if you can't feel, what's the point?",The Giver
312,nolongerunown,"Bad marketing, great movie",10,16 August 2014,"OK, let me start off by saying I've read all the books (the Giver, Gathering Blue, Messenger and Son.) Also, this isn't near exact to the book, but it is still very good. It hits all the key points of the book, the futuristic technology actually fits in very well if you don't dwell on it, and the only change that didn't make it as good as the book would be the characters being older, but this is easy to forget if you go in with an open mind.Yes, there is added romance, but this really only lasts at most 5 minutes. Also, nothing in the plot is change so much that Gathering Blue, Messenger and Son couldn't get an adaptation and be accurate ones as well.Over all, the people hating on this movie are just way too NITPICKY, sure certain things were added here and there but non really change the story too much and in some cases make the story even better. It can't live up to the book, but NO MOVIE EVER COULD. It's a good movie and I recommend checking it out. Just go in with an open mind and you'll likely like it!",The Giver
313,xxkingoxx4,Beautiful,9,17 August 2014,"I honestly don't understand why people are giving this movie such low scores. It was fantastic. Sure they made 1 or 2 changes from the book but I think they were good changes! (spoiler alert:) In the book when you gave somebody your memories you lost them in the movie you didn't which is better because it gives The Giver a purpose at the end of movie (Helping the community after) The Movie did an amazing job showing how beautiful emotions can be (Love) and that even though humanity can be evil sometimes it also has a lot of beauty and when the community took away love and joy and music they lose their humanity. It also showed off color has beautiful and something special, something I have never seen before. Maybe Im just seeing this movie from a different angle then everybody else but I loved it. 9/10 P.S Sorry for the poop grammar",The Giver
314,rsolberg54,Great movie!,10,20 August 2014,"I never read the book The Giver, so my review might appeal more to others who haven't. I enjoyed this movie immensely. It portrays the results of governments who try to micromanage everyone's life and in so many ways reminded me of the current efforts in our society to have ""sameness"", no one wins, no one loses, no one is better than anyone else. No choices because the so called leaders always know what's best for you. The story unfolds well and the acting by Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges is great. This movie can provide a lot of opportunities to talk with your children about emotions, making choices, and the importance of family and friends.",The Giver
315,aehaugen1007,Way different than the book,4,20 August 2014,"If you have read the book I hope that you can relate to this review. I read the book a few months ago and I thought it was a pretty good book in the fact that it was emotional and made you think. You also formed a sort of bond with Jonas which the movie doesn't give off. The movie started out sort of the same as the book, but a little before halfway it got way of track. Jonas and Fiona never have a relationship in the book like they do in the movie. Also in the book Fiona isn't such a big character. In the end you are only supposed to know what Jonas is doing not the entire city. Keep in mind that this book is a book for a fifth or sixth grader to be reading. I know that movies are supposed to be a little different than the books, but not this different.",The Giver
316,maxensmom,Loved it!,10,26 August 2014,"I am a huge fan of the book and I'm normally skeptical watching the movies after. Obviously it wasn't exactly like the book. Some drastic changes were made, but I surprisingly loved the changes and add on's they did! It made me feel all the emotions he was feeling. It opens your eyes to new perspectives! Had me on the edge of my seat in the ending even though I've read the book! I thought they did a great job especially under the circumstances of altering things! I thought the acting was good. They did a clever job of sneaking parts of the book into the movie and following the movie and the main point/plot. I'm not sure why there are negative comments on here about the movie, it was good. If your one of those people who are critical of movies made after books it was still good!",The Giver
317,paulina_tsai,Too many inconsistencies,3,29 August 2014,"The movie has Jonas narrating like he is retelling this story. My first cue that I would not enjoy this movie is when Jonas said (in his narration) ""They asked me if I am sorry...I do not apologize."" I liked that in the book the ending was left as a mystery - you do not know where Jonas ends up doing (alive/dead?) or even if he was successful in his mission. But this movie had to follow the Hunger Games/Divergent formula of a young hero saving the dystopian society from the totalitarian authority. The story line was changed to match this formula - added romance, themes of friendship. Focusing on these new themes makes The Giver inconsistent. Everyone besides Jonas should be used to ""Sameness"" and a drone in society. They do what they do (like Release) because it is what they have been taught from the past and they don't know any better. However it seems that at least the Chief Elder is aware of war memories of existing and that she chose to erase that from the people - making her the villain. Another big thing was that Jonas learned ""love"" from the memories and the Giver, not for Fiona! The movie omitted that memory is passed on, so the Giver would gradually not be able to see color as Jonas gains that ability. To me, when the Giver passed to Jonas his favorite memory and Jonas' decision to leave was a big sacrifice on their parts (a sacrifice to love perhaps). The movie just portrays Jonas as a unsatisfied teen rebel trying to win Fiona's love, instead of a selfless altruist sacrificing everything for the betterment of his community.",The Giver

319,jkaine1995,Amazing Modern Film,8,6 September 2014,"It's very sad that in the time we need explosions to keep us glued rather than actual morals and a real message. Much of this film kept my attention and I loved it but the friend I went with stated that it was ""boring"". So I thought about: not one explosion, no gunshots, no violence- just a simple message that must be said: ""knowledge is power"" and ""we must go through hardships to become a better person"" Now I am not saying this is a perfect film- there are some problems. Like the random clothes Jonas gets when he's in the snowy mountain. And it's clear to see they got the ""hot guy"" to play Jonas which didn't bother me :) ha ha.

She said the movie was a faithful adaptation, although some scenes were missing.Overall, the visual experience of the movie was superb, although some of the drama is slow paced the first 15-20 minutes of the film. The film really stops and makes you think about ethics and morals. That is where this movie shines. The film also introduces an interesting concept for the flashbacks, in a sense it lets the audience experience a more emotional connection with the characters by using real life events/clips.In conclusion: It is well rounded movie, although it has a slow start, but it gets more interesting as the story progresses.",The Giver

Now possibly the book is a little more thorough in its plot development and logic, but by itself there were so many unexplained holes that really hindered my ability to appreciate a pretty impressive cast of characters. So if you're someone who doesn't care about the details, then this might be for you, but for everyone else you might be as irritated as I was and left with more questions than anything else like how is it that everyone seems to have the same birthday regardless of age? Here are some others ... Why even have such an important position such as the Giver in a society that seems to never use it? How exactly does Jonas and the child survive falling off the cliff when it's very, very high. Miracle excuse just doesn't cut it. How does crossing the boundary wipe everyone else's entire memory clean when they are being drugged? Why even take the child with him at all? If Jonas sees the past through the Giver, then why is his first projection of a possible future? Why does Jonas continue to act like a reckless child from the very beginning, but the community continues to put their faith in him?",The Giver

From the beginning till the end, my eyes were totally glued on the cinema screen, always curious of the next step. Every script lines and scenes were well thought of and of excellent directing. Every actors and actresses in this movie played well in their respective roles, which included a short scene of Rosemary acted by Taylor Swift. I liked the concept of humanity found in a inhuman world, and this movie truly showed the importance of free choices and varieties that we seldom embrace for having one.

It was so stirring, so beautiful, and deserves so much more praise than it has been given. People don't care about it or the true meaning behind it because it doesn't involve sex, drugs, or gross humor like most Hollywood movies do today and that really shows the character of our generation. I was one of the few who really understood the underlying meaning and it has shaken me in ways I wish everyone can feel. It just makes me sad that some people don't have that kind of feeling or capacity, much like the people living in the communities. I hope that if you haven't seen it, you will because it captures the true meaning of love, pain, and everything life has to offer. It really, really is worth it. And it has inspired me to be better.

In the next frame, a bottle is in his hand! Then he moves from dessert to snow, and miraculously, he and the baby are dressed for the weather... oh, brother... OK, maybe he has manifesting abilities... but I didn't get that anywhere in the movie. OK, maybe it was in the cart that the baby was in.. but I didn't see it, and that wouldn't explain how HIS clothes got changed. The storyline was done before. I liked it before. I liked it the first three times I saw the same storyline in other productions/movies. There was no ""twist"" with this one - it was the same thing but done in a completely forgettable manner. The characters were not developed well. The black&white thing was done before, and done better (before). There was no consistency from frame to frame.It was amateurish. It was horrible.",The Giver

I recently saw a Ted Talk by Mellody Hobson, that describes this brilliantly: www.bit.ly/1rY24nlWhat are your thoughts? :-)The minimal use of motorized transportation was refreshing. I can only imagine that modern town planning would need a great overhaul to make this possible in many larger cities/communities. Be fit, eat local foods,etc. It would be interesting to see how the people were selected for this Utopian society. Was it appearance, content of character? The latter didn't matter because they were all medically altered. Life did appear simple, but lacking a soul. Do we really want this? Parts of it I guess.

I will also note that I haven't read the book.I was very, very pleasantly surprised by the first half. The world that was created had some interesting concepts. I realized that it had many elements similar to MY vision of an ideal world, so it made me care more. The memories Jonas experiences are an emotional roller-coaster. They were a heartwarming, vibrant and at other times utterly saddening summary of our beautiful world. I came close to tears numerous times as I watched the protagonist discover emotions. This movie just... makes you want to live. This movie at its best is a celebration of life. After this part, though, the movie had clearly already given its best.

As I watched the movie version, the main theme of the book continued to decrease and decrease, and it became more of a sci-fi movie, with confusing character twists and major character changes without explanation.Some of Jonas's actions were absolutely impractical. For example, Jonas and Fiona rode down a huge piece of a building, using plates as if they were sleds. Being raised in a community where no one could do no ""evil"" or break any rules, Jonas would clearly not have done such an event. Not only does the movie take away important story elements, such as relations between friends, family, and the baby after ""escaping"", the film adds many different and crazy elements, such as the Chief Elder being allowed to hologram in on the Receiver of Memory! Such a thing is forbidden in the book, and we hardly know anything about the Chief Elder! With so many changes and edits, I almost feel as if this isn't even based on the book! Based on my memory, the movie comes up with their own scenes more than they add scenes based from the book.

For me, that would be an understatement. You are the epitome of moral and intellectual disgust in the filming industry. Not only have you cheated Lois Lowry out of a film worthy of her, you have also cheated fans of the Giver, by giving them a twisted, horrific, modernized piece of junk in a compact disc.

The book, short as it is, has an in depth story that makes you think about society and how we live (or don't live) our lives. The book is very good as are the sequels.

I understand movies these days always need a little love part in it, but I thought it was unnecessary how they did it. I also thought the movie progressed in a weird way.

336,emilfabrice,Boring,2,24 January 2015,"Another boring ""I am a rebel teenager"" movie. If you seen any of The Hunger Games /Divergent / The Maze - and have higher IQ than room temperature or age above 12 - don't bother watching it... It takes about roughly 10 minutes into the movie so you can tell the end of it.1. Teenager hero gets selected as he is special 2. Cruel adults oppressing the society 3. Teeneger rebels 4. Brings down the current order. 5. EndCan't Hollywood make something new?:P Really just reboots and 1.5 hour movies that would more fit for 40 min TV series (for kid's, as even when they die or fighting with someone, there is no blood...come on)",The Giver
337,larryandrosa-37982,Suspends disbelief to the max,3,14 November 2017,"I had expected a variation and moral similar to George Orwell's ""1984"" but what I ended up waiting for was a mumbling Dennis Quaid as the, to be looked up to know it all. I can suspend belief and imagine, far away places but this show took it to it's very hard to imagine that only hate and conformity exists. I may have heard, ""Yeah that's the point"" but when I had a teacher friend tell me that's what's being read in a different classroom I was shocked. Reality is that we all go through trials of different sort as children with allowances to grow,sing, love, etc. We faced bullying,rivalries, fights, etc. but found a way to learn and grow and get over it.How many movies, or books portray ""Infanticide"" to make a point? Only the desperate. The scene of this actually taking place with the father using lethal injection then disposing the baby down a trash chute is reprehensible. Oh the classroom where it was taught also had LD kids in attendance. Given recent atrocities like ""Sandy Hook"", the Church shootings in Texas, children were harmed or murdered. Year's ago I can't recall this happening for real or in print. To profit on any idea of harming newborns,this was the most vile and to use this to sensationalize a story? Is there someone ""out there"" seeing this whom would imitate, or murder, rather then seek a safe place for a newborn? I doubt teenagers (yet) have the capacity to understand this attempt at being ""Highbrow"" and should've been scrapped to begin with, and not emulate the attitude this story ...tries to convey.",The Giver
338,alyssasmoore,Good Adaptation of the Novel,10,29 March 2020,"Stellar cast and stellar adaptation of an excellent YA novel (1993 by Lois Lowry) that spawned modern era dystopian genre. Beautifully shot when the city got their memories back and the color came back, including the colorful people. Excellent visual metaphor of how safe ""Sameness"" can be, but the cost is the lack of emotional depth. I thought it was cute that Taylor Swift made a cameo. I also enjoyed the performance by the lead actor who played Jonas. If you are an ultimate optimist who still holds that humanity can be salvaged, then you will enjoy this movie adaption of the 1993 novel, The Giver by Lois Lowry. This movie adaptation was a long time in coming.",The Giver
339,johnrob-08225,"The Giver is a film about Jonas, a boy who lives in a utopian community.",6,28 April 2016,"Have you ever wondered what if would be like to live in an alternate reality? A reality where you get no control over your future. You feel nothing, no happiness, sorrow, love, or joy. Nothing. Although it might sounds bleak it also sounds like a very easy way of life. You just get to sit back and let others take care of your future for you. This is exactly where The Giver takes place. In a place you and I could only imagine. Read The Giver and you could see the reality of this life. The Giver is a film that about a young boy, Jonas who lives in Sameness. Sameness is a utopia where every decision is made for them, from their meals to jobs to who their spouse is. Sameness has always been their way, the residents have never known anything different, well, except for the Receiver. The Receiver's assignment is to, well, receive memories from the one before him. The Receiver must carry the burden of memories that are foreign to the Sameness residents. But, when Jonas gets picked to be the next Receiver of Memory he must find the courage to step up to the plate. These memories that Jonas receives bring him lots of feelings and new emotions that he never knew even existed. But, when Jonas sees through what the leaders of Sameness (their Chief Elders) are doing to the community residents, he must find a way to save himself and his newfound friend, Gabe before it's too late. I have read the book and viewed the movie and I believe that the scriptwriters of The Giver did not portray Jonas's character well at all. They made Jonas look very rebellious and ignorant of the rules, whereas when I read the book, I got the understanding that Jonas was an innocent rule-follower. I believe that portraying Jonas in this way made the movie trailers look much more action packed and entertaining which most likely brought in more viewers, but I feel as though you didn't get a true sense of who Jonas really was. In The Giver book Jonas is often very mindful of the rules and is described carefully reading them and ensuring to stick to them. In the movie Jonas did many things against his Community's rules. He kissed Fiona which opposed his Community's rule of 'no physical contact with anybody outside your family unit'. Secondly, he told Fiona to stop taking pills in the morning. Thirdly, he went down the big ramp with Fiona on those miniature sleds to give her the sensation of a sled ride. I feel that this major change in Jonas's personality gives the viewers a twisted and much different idea of who Jonas is. In the book, Jonas was described as an innocent, rule abiding boy. This changed the movie a lot because when Jonas broke a rule or pulled off a cool stunt, I could often hear people next to me saying ""WHOA!"" or ""He is crazy! Is he really going to pull this off?"" and other things of that nature. It really changed the message of the movie from the importance of memories to how much he can get away with before he gets caught. As much as I thought that this ruined the message of the movie, I realize that it probably attracted more people to come see the movie. Most people would rather go see an exciting, action-packed movie over the original plot. I believe that the studio would have been equally as successful with staying true to Jonas's character. This movie was made well, but had it's flaws. I would recommend this movie for age 10 and up and would also recommend reading the book before viewing the movie. I feel that this movie deserves a 3.5 out of 5 stars. I would recommend viewing this movie at some point in your life. It gives you a much different perspective on utopia communities and life.",The Giver
340,marsworld-65850,"Nice to watch as a free-time filler, though has its glaring flaws",7,14 August 2016,"I went into watching this movie expecting a movie similar in style to how the ""Maze Runner"" adaption worked out, pulling vastly away from story in sake of action. What ""The Giver"" gave instead was a film that, while not a 100% accurate portrayal of the book (though not any adaptions are), felt like it had a love for what it is portraying. The music is filled with enough passion to help carry the emotions through a scene into the viewer, which is needed in some scenes as the acting at times can be awkward. When it came to staying fateful to stories portrayed in the book, the movie started out strong but as the movie came closer and closer the the third act, the movie started to I think necessarily change to be more suspenseful to be more engaging in the movie format versus a book format. Other deviations from the book include minor side plots, though some are referenced.",The Giver
341,lilydh-10553,"Great aesthetics and soundtrack, but plot line lacked depth",4,5 October 2016,"The film, ""The Giver"" is based on Lois Lowry's book, tells the story of a perfect world. It is a safe totalitarian world. Everything is controlled by the government, the Elders. They are given drugs to stop their ""feelings."" When Jonas is 18 years old, he's chosen to be the community's Receiver of Memories. He enters into training with an old man called The Giver. From the Giver, Jonas learns about pain, sadness, war, and all the unhappy truths of the ""real"" world. He quickly realizes that his community is fake. Confronted with this reality, Jonas faces difficult choices about his own life and his future. Although beautifully filmed, ""The Giver"" directed by Phillip Noyce, in wanting to conform to the standard YA franchise, deviated from the central theme of humanity and sacrificed the book's elegance by incorporating too much action and romance. First of all, the camera work was phenomenal. I loved the transitions and editing that was done to the film. The music throughout the whole film added an element to the beautiful colors and scenes. No matter how good the settings were, I thought the plot line lacked and the characters portrayal could have been better. Instead of staying true to the book, the director shifted the young preteen characters to teenagers portrayed by young adults. The book has been popular for decades, which stimulated a lot of anticipation for the movie especially for me. Although I didn't expect everything from the book to be in the movie, I expected the same (or even more) emotions that I felt when I read the book. In a way it ruined the more innocent aspect of the story for me. There was all this unnecessary romance added, which took away from the plot. There was also too much action. Instead of focusing on the actual message of the story, the director added motorcycle chase scenes. The movie's aesthetics were beautiful and I loved the soundtrack, but the overall film had ruined the book. It is kind of ironic that the story tells us that conformity is bad, but the film tried to conform to what they believed that everyone likes.",The Giver
342,kalteneggermarcus,It's quite good,8,18 September 2016,"Only having seen the movie and not being influenced by the book I can say that the movie was overall pretty good. The utopian community was portrayed amazing, while showing that it also can be viewed as a dystopian society from the point of the giver or receiver of memory. I loved the story of the movie, where feeling and memories were taken from the people to the point that they didn't even realized that they were killing people. While the movie isn't having really any action it has a great story (which is probably way better in the book) that totally makes up for any lack of anything. The only thing that really bothers me is the gigantic cliff-hanger at the end, which just destroyed my nearly perfectly positive opinion of the movie.",The Giver
343,gunterlp,The Giver,6,26 September 2016,"The giver is a brilliant book and therefore I was super excited when I heard that there is going to be a movie about this page-turner. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed of the film. This is the reason, why I only gave 6 stars...As I mentioned in the very beginning, I read the book, I believe that was the main problem for me, because there were big differences between the book and the movie. So I could not stop thinking of these changes. For instance, the main character Jonas and many other people are aged up in the movie, because Jonas is 18 in the movie, but in the book he is only 12. I know, I know you may think that I kind of overreact, but in my opinion this is a huge change, which is relevant. Also in the books, in order to explain love, the Giver gives Jonas his favorite memory, a window into a family sharing a warm and special Christmas. In the movie Jonas learns about love from words spoken by The Giver, but doesn't truly experience it until he gets close with the ""uncertain"" baby Gabriel. Therefore, I always felt, during the movie, that they left out something very important.But! If you watch the movie without knowing the book, it can be entertaining, because the actors, especially Brenton Thwaites (Jonas) were brilliant. The movie can be very fun, but if you know the book the film is not.",The Giver

345,jul_i,The Giver Class mission!,8,6 February 2017,"We are 3 French classes of 9th grade and we studied the trailer « The Giver ». Our mission was to write a short review about it. Here they are : 3E : This film seems interesting. We think the trailer is well made. It looks really dynamic and futuristic. The music was not original but of excellent quality. The characters are good and they seem to play well. They are beautiful, young and well dressed. There are many amazing special effects. It is interesting and very realistic. We really enjoyed it ! The set is beautiful and varied but on the other hand, the costumes look a little too simple. The set is futuristic and great ! 3C: The music of the trailer is gripping and stressful: it helps building the suspense. The set and costumes are exactly what we can imagine in this type of film, so they aren't very original but they stick to the plot. The trailer of""The Giver"" doesn't reflect the story, the plot is amazing but at the beginning, it was in black and white and it surprised us. Then, we understand why it wasn't in colours. The plot is amazing and the action scenes are gripping. There are many special effects so we can see flying saucers, futuristic bikes...One group in the class thinks isn't really fun because it seems like a teen-movie full of clichés and the end is quite predictable. But overall, the trailer makes us want to see the film because it is science-fiction!3B: The special effects were the most stunning element of the trailer. For example, the futuristic city or the holograms were pretty good. It was mind-blowing. We think it is a great teen-movie, action-packed and full of suspense. It is a science-fiction film that we would like to see because it looks entertaining and fun. The trailer creates suspense. The music was a good choice because it fits perfectly the trailer and it is gripping. The main cast is well chosen because they are young and they play well even if the characters are not really expressive. Another group in the class thinks that this seems to be a classic teen-movie: the plot looks entertaining but quite predictable. There's a lot of action. The costumes are also futuristic. The characters have town and work uniforms, very realistic and beautiful. It is nice to watch!",The Giver
346,raquelgaleramolina,Review,10,16 April 2017,"I recommend this movie because it presents a different world, like the future. I really enjoyed it when i watched, because it made me want to watch again. My favorite actor in the movie is Cameron Monaghan, he is really good at doing this character (the friend of the main character).

348,musica-83078,Bad Movie,1,23 June 2017,This movie has no action what so ever. There is nothing interesting about it anyway Like no action No anything it just people talking and the plot is stupid anyway like this world where u have to walk up like 200 stories and eat. there is no problem that triggers all the action in this story,The Giver
349,kerrfunk1,"Yes, it's different than the book. See it anyway.",7,23 August 2014,"My daughter and I have read The Giver a few times together over the last few years, and I've read it a few times more than that. When we saw the trailers we were skeptical. Jonas is the wrong age and it looked to be a lot more sci-fi than the book. It was a comfort for me to know that the author not only supported the movie's adaptation but genuinely seemed to like some of the changes.I have a hard time saying how I liked the movie. It's a different telling of the same story, and I respect the different telling. It was well made. I was able to look past most of the changes. The movie and the book do not occupy or even contend for the same space in my imagination, and I'm glad of that, because I didn't want to share the book's place in my head.The book and the movie are differently delicious, like key lime and chocolate mousse.Some of the differences: the movie setting is more technologically advanced, and the community differently remote. The ages of Jonas and Asher and Fiona are not given, but clearly they're older than twelve, closer to maybe seventeen. The movie practically begins with the ceremony of assignments. We don't get as much of Asher's goofiness. There's a chief elder in the movie (Meryl Streep) where there's not really a corresponding character in the book. There's an insidiousness in the community government. The Giver's residence is not at all like I imagined.Two other differences: Jonas and the Giver (and Gabriel) share something like a birthmark instead of odd eyes. I really wanted them to have startling eyes. And instead of the Giver placing his hands on Jonas' back to transmit memories, they face each other and clasp forearms. It works well. And the Giver's library is much bigger than I imagined from the book.Maybe that seems like a lot of differences, maybe not. And there's more, no doubt, but I'm going with no spoilers.The movie does not fail to connect, to capture the spirit, to draw the viewer in. Like the opening of the movie ""UP"" which wordlessly hooks you, you're drawn in deeply.I would see it again. And I think that people who have not read the book would be inspired to read it, though I'm curious how well they'd receive it.",The Giver
350,dachiri,If you haven't read the book...,8,11 March 2018,"I kind of avoided this movie since I read the book as young teenager and it had its intended effect. But I finally had an evening to spare with it on Netflix, so I watched. Just like the book, it had me in tears pretty quickly. It held close enough to the book such that the story was recognizable, but obviously took creative license to make it more interesting on the big screen.My big, major complaint is using the love story line. Jonas was *12* in the original book, and there was no major love story. The escape story was also unnecessarily dramatic, and, frankly unrealistic for a story that is supposed to be fiction, not crazy sci-fi (Jonas did not get dropped off a waterfall, trudge through a desert, and climb and descend a mountain in knee-deep snow to leave the community and restore the memories).I was actually glad they showed the ""elimination"" of one twin, even if out of order, since that was an incredibly profound moment in the book.",The Giver
351,s-16089,It could have been better =(,5,9 April 2018,"The book is significantly different from the book in one they changed the movie into more of a romance. The chief of elders is antagonist, Asher is more mature and more serious,And fiona starts have feelings, And added a whole bunch of random scenes. I understand that they changed up the movie to be more dramatic and attract the young adult and tween audiences but they could have been better in my opinion. I rate it a 5.",The Giver
352,gechatzidaki,This is not the book you loved,8,2 April 2021,"I absolutely loved the books. Until the first half of the movie I was very disappointed to find out that it is nothing like the book. I had to give up on comparing them and recognise the film as an independent piece of work to appreciate it. I think for someone who hasn't read the book, the movie could be a 9star choice.Judging it as an adaptation, I have mixed feelings. You don't really get the full picture from life in the community, but the black and white screen kind of fills in the gaps. I think that social profiling remained purposefully blare, so that the characters could be able to act and react differently. I caught myself often thinking 'you couldn't possibly have this kind of reaction in the book'. Although the plot is so different, it holds the general idea from the original work and it succeeds to pass on to the viewer the same thoughts and feelings as the book. The plot had to be sacrificed to go to the big screen.. so the idea and the message only survived, the story is overwritten. So the book didn't make it to the big screen, it's soul did. This is either a zero or a ten star accomplishment -considering one's point of view.",The Giver
353,kayagendreau,The Giver: An Off-Brand Dystopian Film,3,17 January 2019,"If you have not had enough of the trending futuristic movies, and thought the novel The Giver was worth your time, there is the film to go along with it. Just as Star Trek attempted to win over the sci-fi future gurus by replicating the means of success of the classic Star Wars series, The Giver film tries desperately to emulate its predecessor, Divergent. Although it indeed succeeded in grabbing the attention of those with no standards, director Phillip Noyce failed in nearly all other aspects.The film is set in a small, futuristic, dystopian community positioned next to a quaint river. Main character Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) has lived his whole life in a society where harsh rules are set and freedom is limited, because, you know, it's the future. Jonas has been selected as the ""chosen one,"" as he is different from others (some may call him, divergent, perhaps?). His job is to visit this old sag who holds all of the memories of life in the past, and who transfers such memories to Jonas. They call him - say it with me! - The Giver.While actor Brenton Thwaites does an excellent job of not only maintaining, but drawing in the attention of the audience, the plot fails to do so. Stop me if you have heard this one before: Young teenage rebel looks at the rules that society has set for them, and decides to act upon it, featuring a romantic side story that is trying to be kept a secret. It is as if my 10-year-old unimaginative cousin was told to write a story after having seen Divergent, Insurgent, Allegiant, and all of the Hunger Game movies in a row. Honestly!I will give props to Mr. Noyce, however, for deciding to portray the film in black and white. However annoying it may be to the audience for a while, it captures adequately just how much freedom is taken away from the citizens without their knowledge, even something as basic as color. Other than this facet, the special effects do by no means deserve the term ""special."" The scenes featuring Jonas and The Giver alone should be the most climactic scenes. However, nothing in the music, absence of sound, lighting, camera angle, etc. during such scenes screamed ""IMPORTANT!"" or merely whispered ""Hey you should maybe watch this part."" Maybe next time, lord help us all if there is a next time, the editors should considering not working under the influence.Just as cliché as the plot is, the romantic story is no different. Jonas has had a childhood best friend named Fiona (Odeya Rush), whom he sees nearly every day. He begins falling for her, except, believe it or not, his affectionate feelings for the woman of his dreams (literally, he has a sexual dream about her), are torn to shreds by society's norms and rules. That is, no touching of other people is allowed, and one must receive feeling-suppressing injections every morning. So basically, the people are emotionless robots living in a community where they are told what to do and when to do it. No room for smooches in that plan!If you are looking for a good brand of tissues, I would refer you to Kleenex, not some sleazy, cheap knock-off brand. You know, the kind that your underpaid third grade teacher buys for the classroom that feels like sandpaper. Well if you are looking for any movie in the category of dystopian community with the main character of Jonas, I would still not recommend The Giver. So, there ya have it.",The Giver
