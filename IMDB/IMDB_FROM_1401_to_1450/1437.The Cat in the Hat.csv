0,MartinHafer,Obnoxious and likely to fill many viewers with rage.,1,16 September 2018,"I assumed that ""The Cat in the Hat"" was most likely a terrible film, as it's currently #79 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100. This inclusion is recent, as the website changed its parameters for admission to the list to only include more commonly seen films. Before this, films with only a few dozen scores could make the list...now it only includes movies which were rated by at least 1500 users. This change means that many Hollywood films are now on a list which previously was inundated with more independent features. Most of the films newly to the list are dreadful....but being a bad film junkie, I am a glutton for punishment! Going into the film I assumed it would be bad but was willing to give it a chance...like I enjoyed ""The Flintsones in Viva Rock Vegas"" (currently #70, though I enjoyed it and scored it a 6).So is the film bad? Absolutely. In fact, it's horrible and painful to watch. There are two main reasons for this. First, the original Dr. Seuss story was very brief and a movie based on it might only last 10 minutes. So, the studio added a lot....and much of what they added (such as the obnoxious boss and the obnoxious neighbor) was just annoying. Second, not to be outdone by these additions, Mike Myers made his character, the Cat, truly obnoxious and hateful. He talks almost non-stop when so often the film would have worked better had he just shut up! A few times, his prattling was also very child un-friendly--with crude commments that most kids wouldn't understand and a shot to the groin that shouldn't be in a kids movie in the first place?! The bottom line is that the film is annoying and dreadful instead of being fun...and the original story was all about kids meeting a cat who was a lot of fun. In many ways, the film is much like an endurance contest that dares you to turn it off....it's THAT bad. By comparison, Myer's ""Love Guru"" is practically a Truffaut masterpiece!!Parents...think twice about letting your children see this movie...it might just make them stupider...particularly if they like it! Also, after the movie was over, my wife (who had slept though almost the entire movie) said ""Why was that movie so LOUD?!""....I couldn't have said it much better myself!",The Cat in the Hat
1,TheLittleSongbird,Poor Dr. Seuss must be rolling in his grave!,1,19 May 2009,"Dr. Seuss's stories are funny and charming, and some of them like How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Horton Hears a Who have been made into surprisingly good films.(Jim Carrey was brilliant as the Grinch but the animated short is a wonderful timeless classic) However, Cat in the Hat is just a joke of a film. I saw it with four of my friends at the cinema for my 12th birthday 5 or 6 years ago, and all of us hated it.The main problem is the casting of Mike Myers, or miscasting more like. He was good as Austin Powers and Shrek, but his performance as the Cat was beyond cringe worthy. There were times when he had a preposterous Scottish accent that didn't suit him at all(it sounded nothing like the voice he used on Shrek), and all the Cat had to do was make terrible fart jokes, and sing songs with lyrics that were impossible to decipher.The script was terrible, full of fart jokes and clichéd one liners. Kids are most unlikely to laugh at the overused bathroom humour, they will a find it unfunny, or b find it offensive. None of the 5 of us laughed once in this movie, other than when the Cat was singing.The film does have two redeeming qualities. One is some nice scenery in the latter half of the film. The other is Dakota Fanning, who was the only actress in the film who made some effort to make her character true to the story. Kelly Preston was okay, and Alec Baldwin is very good in films like the Shadow and Hunt For Red October, but in films like this and Thomas and the Magic Railroad, he is completely wasted as the villain.All in all, a lifeless and unfunny film. It isn't quite as abysmal as Home Alone 4, but it is really awful. I am sorry if I have offended anyone, I genuinely hate criticising movies, but Cat in the Hat really did take the biscuit. 1/10 for the scenery and Fanning. Bethany Cox",The Cat in the Hat
2,SnoopyStyle,Sad,4,11 October 2013,"Joan Walden (Kelly Preston) has two kids Sally (Dakota Fanning) and Conrad (Spencer Breslin). Mrs. Kwan (Amy Hill) is their babysitter. One day The Cat in the Hat (Mike Myers) appears out of nowhere and create chaos in the house. Alec Baldwin plays the scheming Quinn.Almost everybody is annoying and ugly. Mostly they're ugly on the inside. The boss is cartoon ugly. The kids especially Conrad is ugly bratty. If they were sweet kids, then The Cat in the Hat can go crazy. All the joy is drained out of it. The additional storyline just destroys the childlike innocence of the original book.It's a bad movie. But I'm willing to give them one more point for its audacious visual style. Just being generous.",The Cat in the Hat
3,Prismark10,One messy cat,6,30 July 2013,"The Cat in the Hat books are short stories beloved by a generation of parents and children alike. Dr Seuss holds an affectionate place in the heart of many American families.So when the slight book was adapted to a film, it would obviously needed to be expanded and we enter a Tim Burtonesque world of mayhem as two bored kids encounter Mike Myers, Cat in the Hat.Critics were appalled with this film, so was the estate of Dr Seuss. However it was obvious the film had to be stretched out by introducing Alec Baldwin as the oily stepfather to be wanting to ship the kids off.Mike Myers infuses some jokes which will go above the heads of children but adults would catch, no different to modern Disney cartoons.In fact my kids found the film zany and fun and although not perfect it is entertaining.",The Cat in the Hat
4,jboothmillard,The Cat in the Hat,3,2 January 2008,"I really liked Jim Carrey as the Grinch, so I thought I might as well give another popular Dr. Seuss starring another great comedy actor a chance. Basically brother and sister Sally (The War of the World's Dakota Fanning) and Conrad (Spencer Breslin) are two bored (and grounded) children home alone (besides the goldfish and Amy Hill as Mrs. Kwan), and Mom (Razzie nominated Kelly Preston) wants them to behave, stay clean, but above all, do not enter the living room, or else! Soon after she has left, The Cat (Razzie nominated Mike Myers) shows up to show them that they can have fun. They first sign a contract to ensure that they can have all the fun they want, and no mess (which obviously there will be), and this is when the chaos starts. Also starring Razzie nominated Alec Baldwin as Quinn, Sean Hayes as Mr. Humberfloob and the Fish's voice, Frank Welker as Nevins, Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Kate the Caterer, Paris Hilton as Female Club-Goer and narrated by Victor Brandt. Myers may have his funny moments, and the film may be colourful, but the problems I have are: it is a bit too zany at times, the Things (Danielle Ryan Chuchran, Taylor Rice, Brittany Oaks and Talia-Lynn Prairie, all voiced by Dan Castellaneta) are slightly irritating doing the opposite of what you say, and it is just too much to take in. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Bo Welch, Worst Screenplay, Worst Screen Couple for Mike Myers and either Thing One or Thing Two and Worst Excuse for an Actual Movie (All Concept/No Content!). Adequate!",The Cat in the Hat
5,moonspinner55,"It takes 15 minutes for Mike Myers to appear...by then, the movie has already died",1,26 July 2010,"The 'family film' comes a cropper. Two rambunctious kids are babysat for the day by a talking cat in a red-and-white striped hat, whose comic shenanigans are meant to teach the tykes about love and responsibility. Three unfortunate screenwriters (Alec Berg, David Mandel, Jeff Schaffer) attempted to bring the immortal, unfilmable children's book by Dr. Seuss to the screen, and their sweat-stains are all over the returns. Imaginative art direction and conceptual design do not a movie make...and this one wears out its welcome before the Cat even makes his entrance. There isn't one funny line or performance in the misbegotten enterprise, which director Bo Welch has apparently targeted toward kids with Attention-Deficit Disorder. In the lead, Mike Myers (talking like Bert Lahr doing a Borscht Belt routine) has been made up and costumed with great care and attention, and yet none of his shtick feels fresh. The chaos which erupts (including treating the staircase like a luge--a joke Welch liked so much he repeats it) is mainly a pastiche of highlights from other films. Cheap, ugly, and claustrophobic, the film can't even get by as an oddity because the actors are all straining so hard to sell it. ""Beetlejuice"" did this type of thing far better...and even ""Drop Dead Fred"" is preferable. NO STARS from ****",The Cat in the Hat
6,dbborroughs,This Film Just Doesn't Work,1,13 March 2004,"Mike Myers is a nice guy, but he's falling into a rut. He has dispensed with the pretense of acting for sleep walking through his roles. While he's not as stupid as Jim Carrey when he's trodding the same ground, he is equally annoying.In the Cat in the Hat, Myers does what he's done before in most of his films of late and that is to be silly in the most annoying manner and voice he can think of.The idea of turning Dr Seuss' book about the events on a rainy day into a full length feature was not the brightest idea, simply because there isn't enough material to fill the film out to anything approaching 90 minutes. The film makers didn't learn from Grinch which only worked when it dealt with material from the book, unfortunately in the case of the Cat that material is all over the place, the film is mostly new material so it just doesn't work.The film also suffers from the biggest problem with adapting Seuss- his stuff never looks right off the printed page. Its never truly real so you never believe. The film isn't bad, it isn't good, it just is. As the Cat and the kids go through their paces things happen but its completely uninvolving.If you must waste your time seeing this rent it first.",The Cat in the Hat
7,Boba_Fett1138,Very annoying and unfunny movie.,3,8 November 2005,"This movie was really painful to watch. It was an extremely busy and annoying movie without anything funny or original ever happening. The humor was just completely wrong and totally unfunny.The story is just basically about nothing and only serves as an opportunity for Mike Myers to show his silly antics on the screen. He is however given awful material to work with and an awful imagine-less director to direct him. The movie is annoyingly fast paced at times and it relies to heavily on just Mike Myers. Alec Baldwin does play an enjoyable and good 'villain' and they could had really used him better in this movie. There are really some missed opportunities here...OK I have to admit that there are some good and funny moments but really not enough to save this movie from being a disaster.I did liked the visual style in this weird typical fabricated world with all those weird looking sets and colors. It really reminded me of the Tim Burton movie ""Edward Scissorhands"". No wonder it did, director Bo Welch worked on ""Edward Scissorhands"" as the production designer. Unfortunately the visual style is underused and doesn't play a significant enough role in the movie. While watching this movie I really kept on wishing that Tim Burton would had directed this movie with perhaps starring Johnny Depp, how perfect would that had been?I don't see how anyone could like this movie and I most certainly can not recommend this movie to anyone, especially not to children. If this was a movie made for children than it was done completely wrong. There is nothing to enjoy or find imaginative in this annoying, loud, too fast paced mess of a movie, that has totally no story and a wobbly message in it.3/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Cat in the Hat
8,disdressed12,"not suitable for kids or adults,not suitable for any age group.",1,24 February 2007,"this movie is pretty bad.i haven't been this bored in a long time.Alec Baldwin must have been into the sauce when he agreed to do this thing.it's marketed as a kid's movie with a PG rating,but this really isn't a kid's movie.there is some very adult language implied.yet it is not a movie for adults either,because it is so juvenile.so,really this movie is not suitable for anyone.By the way,Mike Meyers looks like a complete idiot as the cat.this movie doesn't strike me as being very faithful to the spirit of the children's book by Dr.Seuss. the only other thing i can say about this movie is it is colourful.otherwise,there is no good reason for anyone to watch this movie.a weak 1/10",The Cat in the Hat
9,Edvis-1997,1,1,30 November 2018,Very awkward and disturbing movie. I don't know how it's possible to enjoy it... It's really bad and the problem is that you can't say which part is bad because whole film is a trash.,The Cat in the Hat
10,ironhorse_iv,This cat in the Hat need to be put to sleep for spitting out this awful hairball.,3,17 April 2013,"Honestly, I'm probably one of the very few people that like the movie, 2000's real life version of How to The Grinch Stole Christmas. So when I heard that Cat in the Hat was being made, my first thought, was OK, I hope it's as good as the Grinch which I thought was decent. I saw The Cat in the Hat recently and I was amazed at how inappropriate it was. It's disgusting! It was a pastel colored nightmare that I hope I never have to sit through again. Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat is the worst of all the Dr. Seuss movies so far. This film is awful. I really had doubts how they were going to fit in, a short book into a 2 hour movie, and when I saw that scary clown mutant cat dressed and play by Mike Myers that looks more like a child molester of Ronald McDonald in a furry costume, I knew this movie was going was going to be hard to watch. It's so evil looking that the some kids after seeing him in that awful makeup. The movie has lots of naughty jokes like there's a scene where the cat stares Kelly Preston's boobs and the cat pumps up his hat in an erection matter. Then there is butt cracks jokes, as well awful sexual puns. It's like they forgot it's a kid's movie. Let's not forget the scene where the cat got hit over his balls with a fantasy plot point of the cat wearing a drag with sparkles of unicorn? Kill me. Another thing is that film is so lazy that it rushed for adding more plot stories to the point it's not even like the book. The book is pretty simple. It features a tall, anthropomorphic, mischievous cat, wearing a tall, red and white-striped hat and a red bow tie. Here, Mike Myers is not a tall cat, but a fat bobcat hybrid. In the book, the Cat brings a cheerful, exotic and exuberant form of chaos to a household of two bored, loneliness, and friendless young children, brother and sister, one rainy day while their mother leaves them unattended. In the movie, Conrad (Spencer Breslin) is a destructive and misbehaved 12-year-old brat and Sally Walden (Dakota Fanning) dull, well-behaved, and rule-obeying 8-year-old daughter, so unlike their characters in the book. The only problem about changing the characters, is why did they created two of most unlikeable children ever. I would rather have the loneliness children of the book since that is how we, the readers can related to. Mike was honored to play the cat in the hat because of how much he loved the book. Well, he doesn't act like the Cat in the book as he even states that he can't rhyme. Cat in the Hat can't rhyme? It's like if Sam I am can't make Green Eggs and Ham. It's doesn't make sense. Instead, we get Cat's personality goes beyond simple homewrecking a-hole. Poor Mike Myers, he sounds like he miss misses his old career at SNL. Obviously, the jokes, scenes, and impressions all look like rejected Saturday Night Live skits in this film. Before I forget, Adam Baldwin is in the film as the villain Larry Quinn, who wants to send Conrad to military school to solve his destructive ways and marry his mother Joan (Kelly Preston) for her wealth. I don't know what wealth, because in the film, the mother seem like a low-paying real-estate agent who boss Mr. Humberfloob (Sean Hayes) fired people who leave a mess due to Obsessive–compulsive disorder. Sean Hayes also plays the fish in the story. He is barely mention in the film, which is so unlike in the book, where he is the orderly protagonist to Cat in the Hat chaotic antagonist. There wasn't no need for Larry Quinn or Mr. Humberfloob in this movie. Yeah, it didn't feel like Cat in the Hat anymore, or at least the one I grew up. Yes, neither did ""The Grinch"" as everyone else says, but I felt like that movie could get away with some of the things they did to some extent because, well, it's the Grinch. He's mean, cold-hearted, and was willing to destroy a well-loved holiday just because he wanted to make everyone else miserable, and adding that back story to him, gave us a reason to feel for him, he wasn't really a monster. In Cat in the Hat, the Cat is just awful. In here, you have rubbery fast-paced special effects. The music and singing that pretty damn bland. There were a few moments that got a small laugh, I felt like there was a lot of things Mike did as the Cat that I don't think the Cat would do like swear in front of children. Yeah, you really put it into words best: the attempts at being more adult, relevant, and meaningful just make it more obnoxiously juvenile, dated, and pointless in the end. This film represents everything wrong with kid adaption movies. I know that Dr. Seuss estate even sued Hollywood to prevent any more live-action movies of his books due to this movie. I have to agree. The biggest insult, this film had was a dumb cameo by Paris 'I really wish she never existed' Hilton. What an abomination! I agree that this whole movie is one big sellout, and they plug Universal Studios Florida and other products in the film. Growing up I adored the books Seuss wrote. They taught me to read and properly emote. When I read such stories and things before bed, it made me call up fanciful things in my head. This movie is crap, and I'm proud to say, I'd rather watch the cartoon version any day.",The Cat in the Hat
11,briancham1994,Not so bad,6,4 June 2020,"I'm surprised by the low rating of this film. I can see the flaws - yes, the comedic style is bombastic and frenetic, but the acting and authentic Seussian visual style made up for any shortcomings.",The Cat in the Hat
12,FiendishDramaturgy,Dr. Evil In The Hat,1,7 October 2004,"Dog the Grinch if you must, but it was LIGHT YEARS ahead of this muddled mess!! They were so worried about Carrey coloring the role of the Cat in the Hat, that they hired an actor who has one basic personality which he dresses with different costumes. This was nothing more than Mike Meyer's ""Dr. Evil"" character in a cat suit. He uses the self same gimmicks in his shtick as the maniacally irresponsible Cat, as he did as the irresponsibly maniacal Dr. Evil. There's very little difference between the two and what difference there was, he comes off as a very poor comic this time around.The creation of the city was quite nice and Dakota Fanning was a joy. The boy who played her brother and the fish were decent characters, but Mike Meyers' interpretation of Dr. Seuss's Cat was extremely sickening. He was very under dramatized (and must have been cememted in ""Dr. Evil"") for Cat in the Hat. While Dr. Evil was a likable character in the Austin Powers movies, he had no place in this work. Hindsight being worthless, they should have hired Jim Carey and not been concerned with the ""Grinch"" comparisons. He, at least, would have played DR. SEUSS'S character and not Mike Meyers' character.The Universal Studios ad right in the middle of the movie was the least tasteful thing in a virtual sea of tastelessness. I actually PAID to see a Universal advertisement. I have just been violated. No. Really. Ah well, this will be remade in a few years, anyway. It rates a 1/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Cat in the Hat
13,elshikh4,Someone pressed the accelerator just a bit much !,3,7 December 2009,"OK, the sets were dazzlingly colored like happy children book. Mike Myers delivered some wacky performance, I bet he wrote some of his own lines. And the meaning of the story seemed good (don't take it so-serious-you're-not amused. And don't take it so-fun-it's-a-mess); hence it doesn't deserve the Razzie Award for the Worst Excuse for an Actual Movie. But. But. But. But..There were horrible matters. (Alec Baldwin) messing with his navel (UGH!). The whole mean dealing with the babysitter from Thailand. Plus (Thing 1) and (Thing 2) looked like real, evil and so ugly demons!Mike Myers played some of his ""very adult"" moments but in the wrong place. I don't see what's the need for seeing him looking to a playboy poster-like (of the mother!) to have his hat gets longer while we're supposed to be in a kids movie! Or the talk about cutting off the balls! Or seeing him chopping off his tail! And I was sick of his annoying ""Oh Yeah!""; it sounded endless!The make-up as a Jamaican produced such a fearful view. Or dancing in a girl's dress; that was totally emetic (Now that deserves a special Razzie apart!). The actress who played the mom seemed silly. The 2 lead kids weren't less ridiculous. This is the movie where the good guy and the bad guy both aren't ashamed of burping loudly! And I just want to know who did come up with the idea of (Paris Hilton) for a cameo in a Cat in The Hat movie?? She can fit more for The Cat in the Hat; The Pornographic Version!Then, the main tragedy; the pace. This is even bad as a cartoon. Simply it's not a smart move to play a whole live movie as a Roger Rabbit movie for ALL THE TIME. Can you stand being in a speeding racing car for 80 minutes?! This is nerve-wracking. There is no station to stop, or to calm down. I thought that the songs may handle this mission, but they didn't. This was heavy at places, and so wacky at others, both ways it annoyed while being entertaining. Thank god that it didn't annoy more!All in all, it was a kids movie, slightly sickening and adrenaline helpless junky in the same time!",The Cat in the Hat
14,GiraffeDoor,Insert lazy pun here.,6,8 January 2020,"Bombastic, high fructose attempt to realize on set what was never meant to be more than a bedtime story illustration.Pretty far removed from the tone of the original book, there is so much padding that the whole thing becomes rather risible. it's all fun in a grotesque way but you have to be in the mood to laugh at the lame CGI gorged jokes as well as with them.Mike Myers makes a pretty vivid Cat who can be a little annoying and more than a little terrifying.It's stupid, but sometimes stupid things are bizarrely distracting.",The Cat in the Hat
15,davispittman,Well here it goes....,5,9 March 2015,"OK, so Dr. Seuss Cat in the hat is Of course a film adaptation of the famous children's book. If given the choice between this or the grinch, choose the grinch!!! Not saying this is awful, but it's by no means good. I thought going in, that this would be a cute little funny family friendly popcorn flick. Um... Let's just say, it's not exactly that. There is no way I'd let anyone under 7/8 watch this movie! From the cat saying ""son of a bi...."" Thankfully it cuts off, but still, it says 80% of the phrase! That and other mild sexual innuendos just aren't appropriate to be put in a children's movie! And for some odd reason Paris Hilton is in here for a brief cameo. Why???? I did enjoy the repair man gag... I thought that was funny. And I also liked Dakota fanning in this, I thought she did a very good job. I didn't really think Alec Baldwin was the correct choice for his role.

Other than that, one is aghast at the offensive inappropriate sex and vulgarity jokes that are certainly not any part of why families love the original books and artwork. Mike Myers let loose with crude humor is a fatal flaw in this manic nonsense, in fact he is the worst thing in it. Dressed like some tubby child molester with erection hat and playboy centrefold jokes about Mummy, the cat in this furball mistake is like some crude visitor who wants to introduce under age children to sexual connotations.

20,rosscinema,Hollywood ruins another one!,2,3 November 2004,"Hollywood is so scared to try and make films with a fresh script and they're running out of popular books to exploit so the studios are now turning to Dr. Seuss and raping his stories with big stars in the cast. Story really has nothing to do with the book so this film is about two kids left with a babysitter while their mother is at work but will return later to host an important business party. Joan (Kelly Preston) is the mother of an icy tattletale named Sally (Dakota Fanning) and a trouble making brat called Conrad (Spencer Breslin) and she calls Mrs. Kwan (Amy Hill) to come over and babysit but she's a narcoleptic and immediately falls asleep. Meanwhile, their neighbor Lawrence Quinn (Alec Baldwin) wants to marry Joan and send Conrad to military school and he keeps snooping around and checking on them.*****SPOILER ALERT*****While at home the kids are visited by The Cat (Mike Myers) who wants to teach them some of life's lessons and makes them sign a contract and along with the help from Thing 1 and Thing 2 he starts to systematically tear up the house. After a series of events their home is practically destroyed and Sally and Conrad throw out The Cat and decide to face the wrath of their mother and take the blame.Bo Welch is making his debut as a director but he's best known as a terrific production designer and I have to admit that this is a very colorful film to look at but that's about the best thing I can say about this. Like ""The Grinch That Stole Christmas"" this only resembles the Dr. Seuss story in title and character only and the rest is a dizzying assortment of visual sight gags and annoying skits with Myers hamming it up like a nightmare version of Bert Lahr with the same type of laugh. Some of the material that's presented would seemingly be enough reason for the Seuss estate to file a lawsuit from Myers dressed like Carmen Miranda and rubbing himself to the two barfing scenes or giving the initials to a type of vehicle that spells s**t. I found the ""Grinch"" film annoying and lacking the spirit of both the book and the television special but that now seems much better than this cliché riddled sellout. I'm not complaining to much about the inappropriate material for children but what I do consider wrong is seating a child in front of a piece of commercial nonsense like this because their young minds are going to think that this is what they are supposed to consider entertainment. Is this film really suitable for kids? I'll let everyone make that decision themselves but just remember that the high profile cameo comes from none other than Paris Hilton!",The Cat in the Hat
21,Kamurai25,"""2 Kids, a Cat, a Mom, and the Guy That Into Her""",6,18 July 2020,"Decent watch, might watch again, and can recommend, but more for older audiences.While ""The Cat in the Hat"" is a famous children's book, this is clearly just aimed at the folks that might have read it when they were children. That mixes the nostalgia factor with the slew of adult oriented jokes (like infomercials) and the unnecessary addition of mother being single and dating. Kids aren't going to find humor in those situations.The material that is closer to the original book is much more charming and I imagine that kids will relate to it more as the kids are much more involved, or even the focus of the scenes.The Cat in the Hat, even though he is the title character, is a support character to the two kids, played by Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin, who both do all they can with the writing to balance out Mike Myers as the Cat. I don't feel like Mike Myers understands the idea of being a supporting character: he gives me a very Tom Cruise / Jimmy Fallon vibe where if there was a pause, then would just center himself in the camera and do something to draw attention. ""Oh yeah!"" is a good example for this movie, a repeated, unnecessary line that doesn't once help the scene let alone the movie.One would think after Jim Carey's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" (2000) there would be a formula for how to adapt Dr. Seuss books (20 pages) to full length feature films, and someone clearly figured it out later in ""The Lorax"" (2012) and ""The Grinch"" (2018), so I'm....gonna blame Mike Myers.Him aside, the movie has a lot of charm to it, and Alec Baldwin manages to work an unnecessary part to at least be a believable antagonist, though the best acting in the world can't make a bad part good.If you're just really into Dr. Seuss, then give it a watch, but you're not going to miss anything special if you skip it.",The Cat in the Hat
22,Rob_Taylor,Ewww! Not so much a fable as feeble....,2,30 March 2004,"It's been a long time since I saw a Dr. Seuss book, much less read one, but I have vague memories of a slightly irreverent Cat that ultimately does the right thing.This mess, on the other hand seemed to have few of the qualities I remembered as a kid. I don't recall the Cat spouting double-entendres and using crass humour in the books. So why here? I can only conclude that the writer tried to ""update"" the Cat to a more modern version. But I have to say all it succeded in doing was annoying me intensely. Who was the film aimed at? Was it aimed at anyone? Will anyone find it entertaining?All in all this was a mess of a film that should have been done by someone else, or left well enough alone altogether. I believe it got a Razzie award as ""The Worst Excuse for an Actual Film"". I suppose I should give a nod to the effort, since in this day and age all Hollywood ever seems to do is remake old films. But try as I might, I can't get enthusiastic about this movie. It's Completely Rubbish And Peurile, to give it the same treatment as the Cat's car.Avoid this one if you have fond memories of Dr Seuss' works. In fact, just avoid it. About the only good thing I have to say about it is that it's not as bad as Rocky and Bullwinkle and didn't have big name stars making fools of themselves (apart from Myers, whose star seems to be waning a little these days - and who can tell the Baldwins apart, anyhow, so little harm done there).Give it a miss.",The Cat in the Hat

This movie on the other hand is nothing but same on a good story by Dr. Seuss.The acting from the two kids were pretty good.

HE could be in a horror movie and THAT would be equal parts funny as it is horrifying: as per the IT memes that have been spawned from Cat in the Hat memes. This movie is CANCER! Its script is atrocious: it NEVER respects Dr. Seuss' works. The direction is a joke: a f###ing set director made his directorial debut here (WTF?) and why was it Cat in the Hat that he chose to direct? This film has only stingy connections to the original book: the rest of the material is superficial filler-content just to pad-out the story to feature-length status. The acting it the worst: even Mike Myers couldn't redeem this stinker post-Shrek. And besides all that? There's nothing else. The music is less than memorable as well.

25,Sirus_the_Virus,People thought the Grinch was bad?,1,20 August 2009,"Back in 2000, Ron Howard directed the live action version of The Grinch, which everyone thought sucked. I loved it. Three years later, The Cat in the Hat came out, and i realized something. Everybody should've apologized. The Grinch don't have nothing on The Cat in the Hat. The Cat in the hat is a horrible film experience. It's also terrifying. Now, how could a children's film be scary? Look as Mike Myer's face in this film. You will want to throw up nonstop until you're dead. I've only seen The Cat in the Hat three times. I don't know why I watched it that many times. i don't know how i watched it once. I only found one part of it amusing. That's the part where the Cat is pretending to be the cook and cuts his tail off. That's the only scene I found amusing and the only part you will find amusing. Also, there are an eyefull of visual effects and set. But besides that, The Cat in the Hat is just flat out terrible. For people to bash the Grinch is sick also. They really should've apologized for what some of the critics said, because The Cat in the Hat is unbearable and terrible. It's crude and for those who hated The Grinch, you can go to hell. Jim Carrey was incredibly likable as Grinch. Mike Myers is incredibly terrifying and unlikable as The Cat.The Plot: Based on Dr. Seuss's famous book, Two children are sitting in there house on a rainy and boring day and a mischievous cat appears and shows the kids a fun time. Which the film isn't.",The Cat in the Hat
26,IonicBreezeMachine,"Good production design and one or two amusing gags or concepts, but Myers' obnoxious performance and crass delivery make this excruciating",3,30 June 2021,"In the average town of Anville, a brother and sister consisting of uptight rule driven Sally (Dakota Fanning) and mischievous chaos prone Conrad (Spencer Breslin) are left home with narcoleptic babysitter Mrs. Kwan (Amy Hill) as their mother (Kelly Preston) tries desperately to keep her home clean while also fulfilling the demands of her germophobic OCD boss (Sean Hayes). The kids sit around their house bored until the arrival of a giant cat (Mike Myers) arrives and entices them into a series of chaotic misadventures that escalate. When the mess becomes too great the trio have to work to clean it up before their mother's boyfriend Larry (Alec Baldwin) can show their mother the ""mother of all messes"".Beginning development in 1997, the film was originally envisioned as a vehicle for Tim Allen as the Cat before scheduling conflicts the The Santa Clause sequel forced him to drop out. Development was sped along after the mammoth success of Jim Carrey's How the Grinch Stole Christmas with Mike Myers becoming attached to star as part of an out of court settlement involving producer Brian Grazer and a soured deal with Myers involving broken promises where Myers backed out of a planned film based on his SNL character Dieter which resulted in a protracted legal battle. The film marks the directorial debut of production designer Bo Welch (also carried over from the cancelled Dieter movie). The movie was noted for its panning by critics and audiences and the declaration from Dr. Seuss's widow that no further live-action films would be approved by the Seuss estate. The movie is undoubtedly bad and all of it can be traced to Myers.Myers as the is simply awful, while in concept he's supposed to be a Bugs Bunny like wisecracker whose chaos is good natured, in practice he comes off as a creepy, leering, malicious, and sometimes perverted weirdo who's more off putting than endearing. Myers is a proven comic talent with his work in Wayne's World, Austin Powers, and Shrek showing just how capable a comic talent he truly is, but here it's clear that no one's told him to rein it in as he's not playing a character but more of a delivery for his familiar schtick (with Myers Scottish ""shrek "" voice, and even his Dr. Evil voice reappearing). Not only does Myers not fit in the Dr. Seuss world with low brow gags involving him looking at a picture of the kids' mother like it's a Playboy centerfold (with an extending hat gag) or scenes where he almost says naughty words, but Myers often seems to be doubling as his own laugh track as the cat periodically uses a wheezing chortling laugh to cap off his punchlines that's both obnoxious and creepy. The makeup used to create the cat is massively misguided as Myers is clearly having trouble not only moving as his arms never go above his shoulders, but his facial expressions are limited so that he looks uncomfortable with even his chortling laugh looking more pained than joyous.Outside of Myers, the characters are all differing degrees of annoying or bland. Alec Baldwin's two modes consist of a phony self aggrandizing salesman persona, and a slovenly lout who pits his nose and navel in an embarrassing gross-out fat suit scene. Sean Hayes of Will & Grace in a duel role plays the voice of the Fish in a screeching manner, and plays the germophobic boss with overenunciation and mugging to an excruciating degree. Kelly Preston, Spencer Breslin, and Dakota Fanning all give the least awful performances by virtue of being rather bland with Preston as workaholic mom and Breslin and Fanning basically playing somehow more cartoonish versions of Bart and Lisa Simpson (which have less gravity and believability than an actual cartoon). On occasion there were some decent sight gags such as the Cats car S. L. O. W. that has an amusing moment where three different steering wheels come out from the console for everyone to drive, and some of the production design could occasionally look impressive. Bo Welch as an Academy Award winning production designer on many Tim Burton films and Barry Sonnenfeld films has shown he has a good visual eye and has even done some good directing work on Patrick Warburton's The Tick series and Netflix's A Series of Unfortunate Events. Apparently behind the scenes Myers would often belittle Welch and take over comic direction basically leaving Welch little control over material or direction so it's likely Welch isn't all that much to blame as Myers diva behavior with uncredited re-writes and direction most likely resulted in the misfires.The Cat in the Hat is a bad movie with a nice coat of paint. While the production design can be impressive (even if it feels like a bouncier version of suburbia from Edward Scissorhands), the performances, thin story, and crass lowbrow humor make this an excruciating sit. With the unnerving makeup on Myers coupled with his method of laughing at all his own jokes, The Cat is one of the most annoying comic performances to headline a major would be blockbuster.",The Cat in the Hat
27,ProjectAnomaly,The Cat in the Hat,1,21 November 2019,0/10. Best and worst example of miscasting (misCATting?) ever. This is hardly a homage to the original author.,The Cat in the Hat
28,sharky_55,"I'm not so good with the rhyming, not really, no.",3,3 May 2020,"To this day, I am still frightened of Mike Meyers in The Cat in the Hat, an adaption that had Dr Seuss spinning in his grave from the opening credits. If you read my Grinch review, you'll see an overview for this planned Seuss live action cinematic universe and my main problems with it. Undeterred by the largely negative reception to its Iron Man, Universal Pictures saw the dollar signs and locked onto the next children's picture book that they could ruin. The movie may begin with with a tribute to the storybook aesthetic of its roots, curly font and all, and may be officially titled as Dr Seuss' The Cat in the Hat, but it most certainly takes the name of its creator in vain. In lieu of the original's simple charm and short and sweet life lesson, the movie is a 82 minute (bloated and feeling longer than that) mishmash of crude skits, and inconsequential diversions. The tonal disaster can be summed up in a series of questions directed towards the creative team behind it:Why does it seem that everything in this movie's aesthetic and visual style is designed to make me upchuck? Why did the makeup artists not learn from the creepy dog-human mutations of the Whos, rendering the Things equally as creepy? Why does the Cat's hat spring up after seeing a picture of Joan (this part seems to be cut out of the Netflix version, which indicates some common sense but also the unstoppable nature of this trainwreck)? Why does he take on the persona of a redneck mechanic who isn't shy about showing off his behind? Why is he so scared of litigation, and why is there an implication that he's already ruined other children's lives when they skimmed the fine print? Why is his laugh so unsettling? Why do the Things play gridiron with Nevins? Why does the Cat continually mock Conrad, get his name wrong, and joke about ditching the pair after each mishap? Why does he keep casually suggesting murder as a viable option? Why is he such a sarcastic jerk? Why is there an underground disco in the middle of Anville? Why does the Cat start breakdancing in the middle of the disco, and why is he making googly eyes at Paris Hilton? Why is the previous acronym for his car a swear word, when this is a PG rated, family-friendly flick? Why does the movie pause to shill Universal Studios, and why is this product placement money unable to be detected in the budget?Admittedly, there are a few chuckle-worthy moments of lampshading (""We even managed to work in an up-tempo pop tune for the soundtrack. That's important.""), and I'll always giggle when Easy by The Commodores chimes in as the Cat's private parts get obliterated by Beans. Even I can rhyme better than the titular character from an iconic book written by an author whose main claim to fame were his couplets. That joke might encapsulate the entire catastrophe's most cardinal sin: that it completely and utterly ignores the key appeal of its source material for an adult jokeathon. For every clean, child-friendly gaff, there are ten which break the 4th wall or wink loudly at the adult audience accompanying their children to what they think is a fun family film. A whole panel of executives signed off on this, but obviously none of them had read the book. If they had, they would realise that the Cat shouldn't be gyrating across the screen, licking hoes, or sporting a coconut bra. If you take a glance at the footage that didn't make the cut, you'll get an even clearer picture of the nightmare fuel that traumatised an entire generation, including three different iterations of a scene where the Things cause a flood to slow down Joan (where them blowing up a dam is only the second most disturbing scenario). Predictably, the film has gained a cult following in the age of the Internet, where irony is second nature and sincerity is poison; how could it not, when the same kids who first experienced it are now old enough to actually understand its potty humour? I can't deny them this sort of macabre enjoyment, but let's not be so hasty in its critical and cultural reassessment. Tommy Wiseau's The Room is such a monumental disaster that you just hitch along for the ride, like being mesmerised by a burning house. There's an artistry in the way its creator's megalomania destroys it all from the inside. But this is just sad. A genuine blockbuster effort that misses the point.",The Cat in the Hat
29,Beta_Gallinger,"A weak adaptation, I'm sure Dr. Seuss would not be proud!",4,20 October 2007,"The live action, full-length adaptation of Dr. Seuss' ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"", released in 2000, certainly has disappointed some fans of the original story, but in my opinion, the movie isn't bad, even though I really don't think Dr. Seuss himself would think too highly of it. This follow-up, however, another adaptation of a classic Dr. Seuss story, has generally been more poorly received than its predecessor, and rightfully so! The story features two young siblings, Sally and Conrad. Sally is very obedient, while Conrad tends to do the opposite of what he is told, which could get him sent to military school. One day, the two siblings are left at home with a babysitter. Their mother intends to have a house meeting that night, and expects the kids to keep the house clean. After their babysitter falls asleep, a strange two-legged, talking, human-sized cat suddenly appears in the house! This creature is the Cat in the Hat, and the siblings' pet fish warns them that the cat means trouble! Nonetheless, Sally and Conrad begin to have fun with the Cat in the Hat, but it soon gets out of control, and the house is far from clean! Before seeing this, I wondered how they could make a full-length movie out of the story. ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" has more of a plot than ""The Cat in the Hat"", and it's easier to imagine it being made into a full-length movie. ""The Cat in the Hat"" is a beginner book, after all. Just like this movie's predecessor, they obviously had to add at lot to the story in order to make it full-length, but even still, the plot is lacking. If there were a lot of funny gags in the movie, they could make up for the lack of plot, but the gags are mostly lame, and sometimes put a confused look on my face. Some things here just don't belong in a kids' movie, such as one line about military school (""It's just like summer camp, except with brutal forced marches and soul-crushing discipline.""), the political humour in the part where Sally and Conrad watch the news with their babysitter before she falls asleep, the Cat farting with his bare buttocks exposed, the ""Dirty hoe"" joke, etc. Mike Myers playing the Cat in the Hat had potential, but even his performance isn't usually funny, and doesn't save the film.I'm far from being the first one to criticise this movie. In fact, it seems that it has received a lot more criticism than praise, which it deserves. I'm not even sure if my 4/10 rating is low enough! For adults, I don't recommend this ""Cat in the Hat"" adaptation, and for kids, well, I'm not sure. Many consider this movie too raunchy for a kids' movie, and I can see where they're coming from. For some kids, some of the parts that are inappropriate for a kids' movie (like the examples I've given in the above paragraph) might go over their heads. Well, it's up to parents to decide whether their kids should watch this film or not, but remember the PG rating, and also remember that it's not Dr. Seuss!",The Cat in the Hat
30,vip_ebriega,I guess Cat really did get the wrong hat!,4,13 September 2008,"My Take: Mike Myers' adult humor doesn't fit with the sweet, child-oriented nature of the material. The success of Ron Howard's big-budget adaptation of Dr. Suess' ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" prompted the release of yet another adaptation of a Theodor Seuss Geisel story, this time one of his finest and most memorable. No one would mention the name of Dr. Suess without first having the image of the Cat in the Hat popping up your mind. And so, it's inevitable that this one will be as much as a success as Howard's big-budget holiday hit of 2000 (or in the words of the Cat himself, ""There's not doubt about that!"").THE CAT IN THE HAT is also produced by Brian Grazer, but instead of bringing back Howard, the new director is former production designer Bo Welch, who still flexes his talents here. As a production designer for many visually stunning works as BATMAN RETURNS, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and MEN IN BLACK, Welch makes sure the sets and atmosphere are as spontaneous as possible and good-looking at the extremes. In that way, he fulfills his job as a visual stylist, but as a director, he's as accomplished as a yes-man. When it comes to asking if adult jokes (Cat saying ""Dirty Ho!"" to a literal hoe, Saying ""Son of a..."" incompletely when he accidentally cuts his tail off, a Paris Hilton cameo, etc.) are appropriate even to momentarily appear in a G-rated adaptation of one of the most beloved children's book figures ever, Welch just says ""Action!"" and let the film roll.CAT IN THE HAT might have been funny if it were a different film. But, as an adaptation of a much beloved literary classic for toddlers and young kids, throwing in a smarmy Paris Hilton cameo is a big mistake. Unfortunately for CAT IN THE HAT, that's just one in a series of big mistakes it commits. Mike Myers is a funny man, but playing Cat as part-Dr. Suess character and part-Austin Powers in a creepy Michael Jackson-like make-up is a bad move. Cat performs a series of carnival sideshow antics that might drive the kids wild, but too much of it may have their parents very worried. Or what about those ""mature-level"" jokes meant for adult appeal? Isn't it a little too early for kids to know that saying ""I'm gonna kill ya."" as a joke is supposed to be humorous? Other than the wrong portrayal of the main title character, there's also the character of Alec Baldwin, as a simply gross next-door neighbor, who is simply too much of a baddie in a kid-oriented feature. Are you willing enough to show this to your kids if I told you he picks his belly-button? Despite some highlights of the much younger cast member, the charming Dakota Fanning as control-freak, mommy's girl Sally who gets into a much more mature character than any of the immature adult cast members, THE CAT IN THE HAT aims for the right audiences, but doesn't capture them. The movie could have been a lot more fun as Howard's adaptation of THE GRINCH? Despite some of its flaws, it emerged as an endearing piece of Holiday treat. In fact, a little slice of THE GRINCH's flaws would seem welcome in place of CAT IN THE HAT's flaws.Rating: ** out of 5.",The Cat in the Hat
31,Hollywood_Yoda,Made For Toddlers,3,8 October 2018,"This is not a film for everyone! It should be catalogued along with Barney or Bear in the Big Blue House. In fact, it's not even as good as those shows. Younger kids will enjoy the movie more than anyone, as adults will get bored with it before the credits are over. This is the film that helped to kill Mike Myers career, which was already on life support. This film makes the live action version of The Grinch by Ron Howard look like a masterpiece by Rembrandt! The acting is terrible, the writing was very bad and the sets were awful. After the advice that Alec Baldwin gave his brother Stephen on acting in Bio-Dome and it ruining his career, I'm suprised Alec accepted this film; as his own film career has spiraled.I'm glad that the next Dr. Seuss' films released; The Lorax and Horton Hears a Who, were animated.

33,mitsubishizero,Dr. Seuss is rolling in his grave,3,11 July 2019,"You know it's funny: As a kid I grew up liking this but now that i'm older I realize this's a terrible adaptation of Dr. Seuss' famous kid's book of the same name. While it's based on the book it adds a lot of unnecessary filler to pad out the length. The only good things to come out of this movie are the sets, props and the effects. They really look like the world of Seuss popped out of the book and into the big screen. Where it goes down hill are the acting and the out-of-place adult jokes. The main characters are Sally and Conrad Walden played by Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin. They're forced to stay home with a babysitter (Amy Hill) while their mom Joan Walden (Kelly Preston) goes to work. In addition to having to tolerate eachother they also have to deal with the titular character (played by Mike Myers) who somehow broke in and hid in their house. To begin with, the kids don't really emote that much making them sound like robots. They're kid actors so i'll give them a little leeway though i've seen them act in other movies where they do a much better job.Sally's an uptight control-freak while Conrad's a rebellious troublemaker which needless to say, causes them to butt heads with each other like siblings do. I get the purpose was to give them more personality but I felt like with the book they were more laid back. But that's just a nitpick as the other big problem is the Cat himself. He's supposed to be wisecracking and upbeat and while he does get a few good laughs most of the time he's lewd and obnoxious. It also doesn't help that he tells a lot of adult jokes that just don't fit into this story. Myers also seems restrained in the costume. He's not very expressive like Jim Carrey in the Grinch. While I don't like that movie either, to give credit where it's due Carrey (and Taylor Momsen) were one of the few good things out of that movie due to how expressive they were in their makeup and costumes. They made it work. Myers just doesn't.Speaking of not fitting into the story, Alec Baldwin plays the main antagonist Lawrence ""Larry"" Quinn their lazy, condescending neighbor who wants to get Conrad out of the picture by sending him to military school in hopes of marrying their mom. The original story didn't need one; rather the things The Cat put them through was enough. The kids had to find a way to contain his chaos within the house without destroying it which already was compelling. Here it's just reduced to a typical kids movie: Have a wacky sidekick and an over-the-top adult villain. In spite of The Cat's attempts to give the kids ideas on how to have fun at home he does a lot more harm than good: He slowly and slowly begins to wreck the house with his gadgets and later on his hideous minions Thing 1 and Thing 2. They're just as horrifying as the Who's from the Grinch. They look like sub-species of the Who's!Things get to a point where they have to venture outside the house to retrieve their dog who gets thrown out of the window by one of the Things. This leads to them having to avoid Larry as well as the neighborhood kids who are having a birthday party. One scene I find genuinely funny is when The Cat gets mistaken for a piñata leading to scene where he goes to his happy place. It's lewd but it's also one of the few jokes that still get a laugh from me. After retrieving the dog they lose Larry at a party (where Paris Hilton makes a cameo for some reason). If you read the book you know how it ends. All's well ends well I guess. The big problem with this movie's that it strays far from the source material. It has very little of the charm or spirit from the book or the short. Most of the jokes are offensive, unfunny and/or just fall flat, the acting's mainly stiff and the original moral's lost. The original moral from the book is that it's ok to cause trouble as long as it never goes too far. That's a rare message and it was well done. This movie doesn't have that. It's interesting to note that during the chase scene The Cat pretends to lose his hat in order to see how Conrad and Sally get out their situation which's interesting but like I said those moments are few and far between. It goes without saying this's one of Dr. Seuss' worst movie adaptations.I've heard some people say that this's ahead of its time in terms of it's style and humor but honestly I never got that from this. Dr. Seuss' rolling in his grave right now. Bottom line, put this cat down for good.",The Cat in the Hat
34,johnstonjames,Have The Book. Have The Original Seuss Television Cartoon Special. Liked This A lot.,9,15 April 2010,"People who always rag on this film should be questioned. When was the last time you looked at the book? When was the last time you even bothered to watch the old television cartoon which was written by Theodor Geisel himself? Probably you'll find they've done neither in a long time and are just acting like pseudo authorities.Look I know Geisel's wife didn't approve of this movie(she found it too racy) but consider this know it alls. This movie is really more like the book than Seuss's original T.V. cartoon special was. The original T.V. cartoon written by Seuss himself: (a)gave the fish a name (b)included a contraption called a 'Gre-dun-za' (c)did not include the subplot of the mother's dress The Mike Myer's movie included: (a)the subplot of the mother's dress (b)included the part where the kids chase the Things around with nets. (c)featured art work used at the beginning that looked liked Seuss's illustrations more than the DePatie-Freeling cartoon did.People should stop listening to the critical backlash that accompanied this film at the time of release by critics who hadn't opened up the book in a long time and who hadn't even made the comparisons with Seuss's original when they complained about faithfulness. This movie was much more in the spirit of Dr. Seuss's books then it's critic's want you to think. It's a much better adaptation than the 'Grinch' movie and feels less padded and fleshed out. Take it from someone who reads the book and watches the original Depatie-Freeling cartoon written by Giesel himself, every year, this is a really fun, cool and hilarious movie.

37,ofpsmith,What better way to destroy Dr. Suess's classic story.,2,18 December 2014,"We are probably all aware of The Cat in the Hat. The classic kids story by Dr. Seuss. I loved it when I was a little kid and I still love it as a teenager. This movie gives almost no loyalty to Seuss's original idea. The story goes away from the original book so many times it's hard to count. In this movie we have to include things like dirty jokes, popular culture references, and advertising (in one of the cheapest and most obvious product placements I've ever seen by the way). I'm not going to waste time by explaining the story so instead I'll just break apart every little bit of this film. The worst part about this film is the cat played by Mike Myers. First of all he looks terrifying. Myers always looks like he's being restrained by the costume. You can just see that he's cringing throughout the whole film. The other problem is his dialog. His dialog is horrible. Now this isn't really Myers' fault so I'm not blaming him but first of all he doesn't rhyme. I wouldn't really be focusing on this if it weren't based on Seuss but it is, so there is no excuse. Instead he makes dirty jokes, he references pop culture, and he does everything that had almost nothing to do with the original story. The kids are the other problem with the film. Conrad (Spencer Breslin) is a delinquent, and Sally (Dakota Fanning) is a control freak. That is literally all the character depth that they have. They don't even try to make them interesting. I can sum them up in one or two words and that is all we are given. Do I recommend this movie? No. Not by any means.",The Cat in the Hat
38,raymond-15,A feast of colour & action for children,6,28 May 2007,"Not as good as MATILDA, but a fun film nevertheless. There is plenty of colour, an abundance of action and an hilarious ending. I could also mention it has a message or two for naughty children and in addition it is a veritable baby-sitter's nightmare.A single mother is called back to her workplace for an urgent project so she has to arrange a babysitter to look after her two young children. She tells the children not to make a mess because she will be entertaining that evening and wants every room looking spic and span.In the mother's absence comes a strange visitor, a cat with a funny hat who tempts the children to do all the naughtiest things imaginable. Did you know that a sprung lounge makes a wonderful springboard for hurtling into space? Did you know that if a cat forbids you to open a big wooden box with a gigantic lock you should not under any circumstances attempt to pick the lock with a knife? Of course the knowledgeable cat knew that the boy would open it, and when he did so, the whole house shook and collapsed in one unholy mess. Added to this their pet dog went missing and that was another adventure perhaps best forgotten.The children were terrified about the condition of the house and pleaded with the cat to help them clean up the mess, an almost impossible task with everything either stained or broken and the stairs completely collapsed. And they knew full well mother was already on her way home.In a world of fantasy anything can happen and in this film everything does. The children are quite well cast and the cheeky cat (Mike Myers) who dominates the action does a highly spirited job. The baby sitter knocked unconscious through most of the action is a big fat woman whom they use as a weight to hold down the lid of the devilish box. I won't divulge what mother saw when she entered through the front door. She was completely astonished , as you would be too knowing what mischief children can get up to.",The Cat in the Hat

In terms of vocal quality, his cat voice is as if Meyers is impersonating Charles Nelson Rielly--- and no offense intended to Mr. Reilly, either, because he is a charming and talented actor comedian. Meyers just sounds like him--- kind of New Yorky, kind of ready for a party. While that works for the talented Charles Nelson Rielly, who works with integrity and honor, it doesn't seem to be appropriate as a model for Meyers to rip off for his Cat in the Hat characterization. That is undoubtedly NOT what the Dr. Suess book was meant to be, was it?",The Cat in the Hat

41,EmperorNortonII,Ranks On the Phunometer,7,24 June 2004,"""The Cat In the Hat"" is one of those movies that has been much maligned. The movie definitely plays to children, and most adults have trouble enjoying it.  Granted, it's not a perfect movie.  The story on which it was based didn't offer a lot on the way of plot.  But on the plus side, the art direction is very good.  The look of Dr. Seuss' style is captured well in the scenery and props.  And Mike Myers' frantic antics as the Cat in the Hat do offer laughs.  Sean Hayes pulls double duty as the voice of the Fish, and also as the germ-phobic boss, Mr. Humberfloob.  And Alec Baldwin plays a fun villain.  So this movie deserves some credit for what it accomplishes.",The Cat in the Hat

45,TheHonestCritic,"This movie is just as good as the book. It has a lot of humor and fun, so give it look!",10,17 December 2019,"""The Cat in the Hat"" (2003), there are a lot of live-action movies where Dr. Seuss' stories have been butchered. However, there are a few of them that are very well done, and this one is by far the best adaptation. Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect special effects, perfect sets/locations and a perfect soundtrack. The story may not follow the novel entirely, but the story adapted to the big screen is a lot of fun. It showcases a fresh look at the story of the most famous Dr. Seuss story, with many fun and humorous moments! The acting is stellar, Mike Myers is hilarious as the Cat, Spencer Breslin is funny as Conrad, Dakota Fanning has a dry sense of humor as Sally, Alec Baldwin is a great villain, etc. The rest of the side actors are brilliant as well, and all of their jokes and moments hit bullseye. All of the special effects in the movie are very well done and still hold up to this day. The sets/locations are very creative, and the exaggerated designs make the movie look like it was taken right out of a Dr. Seuss book! Finally, the soundtrack is stellar and it really sets the tone for the movie. David Newman definitely composed a phenomenal soundtrack and knocked it out of the park! Now, there are a lot of people who hate this movie, but I don't care. I love this movie! It may not appeal to everyone, but it's always so much fun to watch. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 stars. This movie is fantastic, and it's still timeless to this day. If you're ever looking for the best live-action adaptation of a Dr. Seuss book, then this movie is certainly worth a look.

I obviously outgrew it and went on to read chapter books. A few years went by then this came out. I kind of wanted to see it. It looked like a cute family film. Trust me, it was. The only problem about that it is only a cute family film, nothing more, nothing less. It was okay.This movie begins just like the book. A huge, disturbing cat comes to a family's house with only two children in it when their mother went away. He wants them to have fun. He introduces them to Thing One and Thing Two. That is basically the only thing that is like the book. Conrad opens the Thing crate that slowly unleashes the Cat's world. The children's dog gets loose and they get him. By the time they get back from their little adventure finding the dog their whole house turns into a huge purple world. They have an adventure to shut the crate. They shut the crate. Everything is back to normal, then the house falls down. They kick the Cat out. He comes back and fixes the house. The mother gets home.Overall, this is just a movie. I also have a lot of questions about this film. Most importantly why didn't any of the neighbors know that their entire house fell down? Wouldn't they hear the crashing wood? It is just bizarre. They are also some cute scenes, like the cooking scene where the Cat cuts off his tail and almost curses. It cuts to We'll Be Right Back screen.

This is a story that doesn't go anywhere and the special effects just take over after a while.  Mike Myers looks like he is channeling the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz, a little Austin Powers, and his Saturday Night Live character based on his mother in law.  He is all over the map.  Some of the humor is inappropriate for the children's audience it is intended for.  Thing 1 and Thing 2 are simply obnoxious.  Alec Baldwin is a tiresome stereotypical man who wants to marry the single mom and get rid of the kids characters who seems to come from another movie.  Only the two kids and Kelly Preston's all too brief role as the mom seem to hold the movie together because they are a likable family.  The lesson both kids learn though seems lost in all the noise.

There were a few downsides in the film such as some of it that wasn't like the book and the, ""Dirty hoe,"" pun because when I heard the Cat say it, I thought he was referring to a prostitute. Also the children's screaming when they first see the Cat is over the top.One of my favourite scenes is the big slide of the purple liquid because it looks fun. The scene that is most like the book is the one where the Cat (plus some others) clean the house with the special cleaning machine.While most people give this film 1/10, I give it 7/10 because it is funny in parts and the Dr Seuss-style Universal and Dreamworks logos at the beginning are brilliant.",The Cat in the Hat
51,stormhawk2021,"Even ""Kid vs. Kat"" was better than this scum",1,9 August 2018,"If I really had to think about it, this might very well be the worst film I've ever seen. It's not enough that it is atrociously obnoxious and annoying, but what really gets me is how badly they screwed up in adapting such a simple, classic, and straightforward story. Sure, I understand that they had to pad it out, being that it's live action and that the source material is really brief, but still...THIS is the end result?!?! The execution is just ridiculously over the top, in your face, and annoying, Mike Meyers (from ""Shrek""), who is really just playing a hyper version of himself in a cat costume and makeup, makes me want to carve my eyes out with a rusty spoon. I really don't have that much problem with him in general, but he really went off the deep end here, and I have no idea what he was thinking. I really don't remember much of Alec Baldwin's and Kelly Preston's performance, but I'm sure it's something they wishes wasn't on their resumes. All I remember from Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning is that they spent a fair amount of time frowning at Meyers, as if they knew they were in a giant pile of crap. This is dumb, vile, and one of the biggest slaps to the face of Seuss and his legacy that I've seen, and that's without considering that I wasn't interested in seeing this in the first place, but just happened to because I was at school, the semester was almost over, and the teacher didn't apparently have any respect for our intelligence and thought we, a bunch of high schoolers, would enjoy watching one of her kids movies since she apparently didn't have anything more on our level, or just didn't trust us to watch anything PG-13 or higher since her rep would be on the line. What a bunch of crap. The ONLY thing I can really give this movie in the way of a compliment is that the look is decent, and there's some okay art direction/set design, but even my enjoyment of that is sullied since it's being used in the most lazy and poor attempt to cash in on something great just ofr money. Also, the fact that some of the cast actually managed to recover from this is some sort of miracle. Avoid this one at all costs, especially if you'd prefer to have your childhood not molested.P.S.: To all these male reviewers who thumbs up this movie, maybe you like the secretary's character, because she's sexy and the actress' name was Candace; go watch ""Phineas & Ferb"" instead.",The Cat in the Hat

53,ScottDMenzel,"A weird, unique film that is interesting to watch from start to finish",7,22 November 2003,"When I first seen the trailers for the Cat in the Hat, I did not know what to think. I really like Mike Myers but this Cat in the Hat movie seemed bizarre to me. I seen a few more trailers and to be honest the movie still looked bizarre but I caught myself laughing at the trailers. So tonight, two of my brothers and I journeyed to see the Cat in the Hat at the local theater.I went to the theater tonight not knowing what to expect. The film started and by the time Mike Myers came into the movie I was hooked. This film was so weird. My eyes were glued to the screen the entire time. I laughed several times in the film and the movie itself was a visual fest for the eyes. It's hard to describe the movie but it's like Austin Powers, A big talking cat, a little Tim Burton, and some great background art all mixed up in a blender and you get the Cat in the Hat. The problem in which I notice with the movie is that its not like the book as far as I can recall. I loved the book when I was younger but it wasn't like the movie. I didn't mind that though. You can't transfer over a book that you can read in 5 minutes into a movie. They took the concept of the book and expanded it. That's the best way I can explain the movie and also this film is very unique. Trust me when I say this you will not see another movie like this one.
The acting in the film for what type of movie it was is good. I enjoyed Mike Myers as the Cat, I have to admit before hand that I really like Mike Myers and I always seem to find him amusing. Dakota Fanning who played Sally in the film, for once did not annoy me. I remember watching her in Uptown Girls over the summer and I hated her performance but in the film she fitted in nicely. Spencer Breslin was also good in the film. The worst performance of the film and the character I feel I could have really done without in the movie is Alec Baldwin. His role was pointless, unfunny, and stupid. Alec Baldwin hasn't had a career in sometime and this idiotic role won't get his career back on track anytime soon. His role was one of the few things I disliked about the movieThe movie as I said above is a visual fest for the eyes. The director and the art designers on this movie do a terrific job. I love the camera angles and all the cartoon backdrops and the fiction like town. The movie didn't have much of a story but its one of those movies where you just watch to enjoy and laugh. It's a fun film for many people. There were some jokes for the kids and a lot of adult jokes mixed into the mix as well. It was an enjoyable movie.So in conclusion, I really liked the film. It put me in a good mood and I for one was not in a good mood when I went to see this film. I laughed quite a bit and I was amazed of how cool the visuals in the film were. I know the critics hated this but it's not a film, which is going to be hailed by critics. If you want a good meaningful movie visit the Independent Theater but if you want a fun, silly, and above all weird movie then go see Cat in the Hat. I would give this film a very strong 8/10 and I will go see it again because I enjoyed it that much.",The Cat in the Hat

Inappropriate moments for kids even though its supposed to be for kids. Annoying characters including the cat himself. Mike Meyers plays the cat, and sometimes when he talks, you can hear his Scottish accent from ""shrek"" and fat bastard. But most of the time he uses an annoying east coast accent. Mike Meyers may've been taking the east coast accent he'd used in ""Saturday night live's"" ""Coffee talk"" skit. Anyways, the first annoying character in the movie is the kid's mom's boss who yells ""fiiiirrrreeeeddddd!!!"" at any slightest provocation interfering with cleanliness, since he was a clean freak. I thought he was just a freak. Next one is mom's possible future fiancé who secretly hates her kids, especially the son who he wants to secretly send off to military school, but he won't show that side of himself to mom. They're both jerks in that stupid annoying bad movie way. Next is Mrs. Kwan, the babysitter who passes out almost immediately after mom leaves. Then comes the cat. I don't even know where to start with him. He's so more annoying than funny. He says many stupid unfunny jokes and puns, with that annoying voice. But he also says a few inappropriate jokes to the kids. Like a ""hoe"" joke. Then he uses Mrs Kwan's comatose body for a waterslide mat. Very disturbing. All of these problems just continue throughout the movie. It very understandably will make people want to rip that horrible cat suit off Meyers and throw it into the nearest bonfire, or if they can't find one just set fire to the suit themselves. Then tell Meyers to wash off the horrible cat makeup, stop that annoying way of talking, and stop those horrible jokes, or you'll have him arrested. The only reason I rated this movie a 2 instead of 1 is because I do not believe in rated a movie 1 when two of the main character are innocent little kids, especially when the makers of this film were stupid enough to have one of the adult characters say things so inappropriet in front of the kids. And I'm not the only one, I have read several reviewers complaining about the hoe joke. Oh, and we see Paris Hilton dancing in some underground club. Yeh, that just fits in the rest of the film.

The movie even had a spot on IMDb's bottom 100 for quite a while. However, the problem lies more with the viewers than with the film itself - it was hated because it was so completely different from what overprotective parents were expecting. This is in no way a children's' film! This is a surreal drug trip with very lame (albeit funny) jokes, and must be watched from that perspective. It will make the experience much funnier.Of course, the people who expected a heartwarming classic for kids of all ages were bound to be disappointed. This is a movie from the folks who went on to write ""Eurotrip"". That should tell you more than enough about what to expect. With its overly bright colours, bizarre characters and sets, and a Mike Myers in hilariously bad makeup, ""Cat"" will be a blast to some and a nightmare to others.

The costuming is interesting, and the color is once again spectacular.  There are episodes of explosive language never even considered by the original author.  Alec Baldwin has a minor role as the villain.  He appears awkward, but is adequate in his role as Quinn.  Kelly Preston is the mom, and her performance is slapstick as it is meant to be. The poetry is only briefly exposed.  It is the most important part of the original books, yet it is conspicuously lacking.  Perhaps the ""Cat in the Hat"" should stay in the can so to speak.

Alas, the script feels more like the work of cynical sketch comedy writers than Dr. Seuss' playful, good-natured anarchy.  Indeed, the Cat himself seems to be rebelling against his creator, dropping the rhyme scheme from his speech within minutes of his introduction by admitting something along the lines of being ""not so good at this rhyming thing..."" Mind you, I didn't find it *entirely* unwatchable: it helped that I found child actors Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin (beloved in our household for his voice work as ""Captain Crandall"" in the animated TV series TEAMO SUPREMO) to be funny and engaging, and I enjoyed Mike Myers' Bert Lahr-esque delivery in the title role (though they've also turned him into a master of disguise, the best of which is his Rasta hippie bit).  Although there's a reasonable amount of laughs, cool props and set pieces, this ...CAT... still feels unnecessarily plot-heavy even with its 78-minute running time (there's a portal into a sort of purple-goo-coated dimension...and the kids have to learn to work with and not against each other...and mom Kelly Preston is up against both her scheming suitor Alec Baldwin and her Boss From Hell Sean Hayes, who also doubles as The Goldfish's voice.  And you thought LORD OF THE RINGS was chock-full of plotting! :-). The real problem, however, is that ...CAT... lacks the sense of cheerful spontaneity that made the book and the rest of Dr. Seuss' work so endearing.  All too often, the movie is obnoxious when it should be puckish.  Well, at least Smash Mouth contributed a couple of catchy songs, including a nifty cover of The Beatles' ""Getting Better.""  Besides, our 7-year-old daughter loved the flick, and after all, she's the target audience. But hey, LOONEY TUNES: BACK IN ACTION charmed and entertained everybody in our little family, so why couldn't ...CAT... accomplish that as well?  Anyway, after ...CAT... and ...GRINCH..., I can't help wondering what could be next in producer Brian Grazer's apparently relentless quest to turn Dr. Seuss' loopy whimsy into loud, garish movies. What the heck, how about a remake of THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T starring that Oscar-winning PIANIST Adrien Brody as the megalomaniac piano teacher? :-)",The Cat in the Hat
64,jaredpahl,"It Will Make You Sad, It Will Drive You Mad, But The Cat In The Hat Is Not That Bad",6,21 August 2016,"You'll be hard pressed to find a more toxic film than Mike Myers' The Cat In The Hat. It's one of the worst reviewed movies of its decade, by critics and audiences alike. Most found its vulgarity and juvenile sense of humor to be offensive, considering the magical and timeless source material. There's no doubt that Mike Myers' Austin Powers brand of humor is an ill fit for the classic Dr. Seuss story, but if you can power through the shock value inherent in The Cat In The Hat, you'll find a fairly entertaining kids romp with a couple of genuine laughs for adults.The Cat In The Hat shares the same basic outline from the book, with two kids, Sally and Conrad, having a chance encounter with a life-sized Cat played by Mike Myers. The crux of the story is that general hilarity ensues and the kids must clean up before their mother comes home. It's a great story to tell in a children's picture book; There it is charming, innocent, and whimsical. Here, the hilarity is a strange mix of Mike Myers brand humor and standard kid's potty jokes. The kid stuff is dreadfully unfunny, but I can't say that Mike Myers doesn't infuse some kind of welcome energy to the proceedings.I may sound like I'm giving this film a glowing review; I'm not. The Cat In The Hat spends much more time with flat gags, needless plot points, and baffling music numbers than it does with the moments of real comedy. The story here meanders through every kind of cliché kiddy movie plot point you can think of, and Mike Myers tries his best to annoy even the most optimistic viewers to tears (He relentlessly shouts ""Oh Yeah"" like an off-brand Kool-Aid Man... Guess what? That catchphrase ain't sticking).I'm not here to sing the praises of The Cat In The Hat. I'm not even going to defend it, but call me crazy, I laughed during this movie. I really laughed, at more than a few points in the film. Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin are cute, and the sets are colorful and inventive. This movie has problems for sure, mainly stemming from the fact that the whimsy of the book has been replaced with mean-spirited, gross-out humor. If you can get past that fact, there is fun to be had here. It all depends on what you're willing to sit through for a couple of good laughs.60/100",The Cat in the Hat
65,haydenluz,The Cat in the Hat,3,27 May 2020,"The Cat in the Hat was directed by the very talented production designer, Bo Welch; he put on a real over the top, off-key flick, taking on the beloved story The Cat in the Hat, originated by Dr. Seuss. Welch gets a lot of understandable hate for this film, but I think it gets more hate than it deserves. It's safe to say that Cat in the Hat did have potential to be at least par, with decent narration, story telling & some jokes, but with everything being very overcompensated & cringey, the outcome was pretty messy.Dakota Fanning & Spencer Breslin seemed to have a tough time sharing the spolight, having below par performances. They had a handful of okay monents, but their character development was so simple and boring, that at the end of the film, their characters were just flat out annoying. The Cat in my bold opinion was the best part of the film. I don't really know anyone else who would nail this role.... again, idk who would want to play the role, other than maybe Johnny Depp. His jokes were really 50/50, but when they landed, they hit decently almost everytime. If you're a natural fan of Mike Myers, you can almost already imagine what you would be in for. Alec Baldwin is a real talented actor with a great reputation, but I have no clue as to what made him sign for this movie. His character is so laughably bad. As for the Fish and Thing 1 & Thing 2, they were fun additions, but nothing more than plot devices to keep the movie going at it's fast pace.The script is really just one big ball of hit or miss jokes, that doesn't hold any weight whatsoever, with very little charm & wit. If you enjoy Mike Myers, his charisma is just oozing all over this movie. If you can't embrace it from the start, you're going to be in for a rough time.The production design was real fun & colorful; it looked like they took pages right out of the book, and put them into frame. With a big budget, they could've gone bigger, but the setting & set pieces was a big plus for this film.Surprisingly, I enjoyed the creative songs throughout the film. They had this fun flow with catchy rhymes.",The Cat in the Hat
66,crosswalkx,The creep in the hat that ruined Dr. Seuss story and it was horrible!,1,12 July 2019,"I have unfortunately seen this movie and I hated it very much with a passion. They decided to have Mike Myers from Waynes World and Shrek act in this movie.What the heck happened, This is a PG-13 rated movie, the Hollywood people has ruined Dr. Seusses book ""The Cat in the Hat"" and turned it into an adult toilet humor profanity filled movie.First of all the boss in the movie is super annoying, he yelled ""You're Fired!"" which he did it long and loud, I wanted to slap that boss.The 2 kids watches violence on TV and then they're greeted by the creep in the Hat a rude annoying cat, he was annoying he used profanity and told toilet jokes and the Fish character was also horrible. I turned off the DVD right in the middle of the film and I never watched it to this day.I'm upset by this horrible book to film adaptation as it didn't follow the book at all. Thank god Dr. Seusses wife has prevented Hollywood people from making anymore live action films.I would suggest you watch the 1971 cartoon ""The Cat in the Hat"" or wait for the hopefully better upcoming CGI animated ""The Cat in the Hat"" movie. Meanwhile watch Horton Hears a Who, The Lorax, The Grinch, 2D and 3D cartoons.This movie should've been PG-13 for toilet humor, mild language, slapstick violence.",The Cat in the Hat
67,travisimo,Dogpile on The Cat!!!,3,27 March 2004,"After hearing all the horrible reviews and complaints about ""The Cat in the Hat,"" my expectations were mighty low, but yet I was curious to see what all the fuss was about.  So when my mom rented it, I thought I would check it out, and hey, it was free for me!""The Cat in the Hat's"" style of humor is very odd to say the least.  The screenplay is written by writers from ""Seinfeld,"" the ""Clerks"" animated series, and ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"" - all shows that I love - but these writers just didn't make the proper transition to the family genre. I can only think of two moments that I thought were genuinely funny - the ""magical"" lawyers and the melodramatic music The Cat plays on the organ. It just seems like they tried to make a family-friendly ""Saturday Night Live,"" and it just failed miserably.  I think they had a problem determining whom this movie was for.  It can be too vulgar for the family set, and it's just too unfunny for the grown-up set.I also question how the cast members approached this movie.  If you check out the outtakes on the DVD, there are quite a few instances of curse words that are bleeped out.  Now, I admit I'm partial to Disney, and I'm sure there's swearing that goes on in their movies, but they don't document it! I'm also somewhat troubled when Alec Baldwin swore every time he screwed up a line, even in front of child actor Spencer Breslin.  I'm sure Spencer has heard those words before; but c'mon, Alec, hold your tongue!!The characters were also extremely annoying.  One of the most annoying things a person can do is laugh at their own jokes, and that's exactly what The Cat did, ALL THE TIME!  It drove me nuts!!!  As for Thing 1 & Thing 2, they just seemed demonic and possessed as they scrambled around everywhere, speaking an unintelligible language.  They reminded me of the ""Teletubbies."" (There's just something about a baby's face in a sun that just freaks me out!)  Alec Baldwin's villain was also super-annoying.  Why was he so bent on sending Conrad to military school, and how could Kelly Preston's character ever fall for him?As you can see, there are just so many things to criticize ""The Cat in the Hat"" about (oh, and I can't forget the Paris Hilton cameo!)  However, I will say that the visuals were pretty good, and they stick in your head for a while.  Also, Dakota Fanning is a fine, little actress, even though she seems to be getting typecast as the uptight kid, because her acting abilities are up there with veteran actors.  Other than that, ""The Cat in the Hat"" is just a disturbing picture that is a slap in the face of the great Dr. Seuss.My IMDb Rating: 3/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: D (Dreadful)",The Cat in the Hat
68,T-ZER0,I'm Sorry Dr. Seuss,2,24 June 2020,"I know Ted Giesel or Dr. Seuss will never read this review. But I thought I'd apologize anyway. Why am I apologizing?I grew up with Dr. Seuss' stories. Every night my parents would read me and my older brother a book of his every night. I would hardly get my pick however, because my older brother would always insist on his favorite. Nonetheless, The Cat in the Hat was one of my favorites. However, I enjoyed the Cat in the Hat comes back a bit more.I am ashamed to say that I liked this film when it came out. That was mainly because I was just a stupid kid who was excited to finally see one of my childhood icons on the big screen. Years passed and now when I look back at this movie. I am ashamed. I can see why Audrey Giesel hated this film, God rest her soul.I will say, some parts of it make me chuckle. I laugh a bit at the Kitchen scene, when The Cat says: ""Magical Time Travelling Elves."" I giggle, also when the Cat says: ""It was ruined when she brought it.""But that's only a tiny bit of funny. The rest of the film is just torture. What made Bo Welch think that a kids book needs adult content and potty humor?? There are several times where the Cat nearly says profanity, which was not in the book. He literally moons the children, similar to what Jim Carrey did in the Grinch. And he is the worst role model ever!! He literally offers for the kids to play tennis and wreck the house more after they already destroyed it!!!Here's something that is just the worst. A kid hits the Cat with a bat, and that's a joke most kids won't get. But adults will think, why would a Cat have private parts in that area? He's a freakin cat!!! Unless he's not which is more terrifying!!Of course, the movie tries to lure you in with the rhyming and everything, but I am just never going to watch this film again. I enjoy the song ""Hang On"" by Smash Mouth. But I wish it wasn't associated with this movie. Maybe when they make a better reboot I will associate it with that.What's even sadder is my younger brother, who was too young to understand Dr. Seuss books back then, likes this film. How sad!!I'm sorry Dr. Seuss for liking this film in the past. I will stick to your books and your better movie adaptations. Like the Lorax, The Grinch (2018) and Horton Hears a Who.May you and your wife Rest In Peace. We miss you both.",The Cat in the Hat
69,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,What A Piece of Garbage!,1,29 June 2019,"Introduction:The Cat in the Hat is a film deserving of all the criticism, hatred, and all around dislike: that it gets. A disgrace against all of mankind, and an abomination to the film industry, as well as a film that makes Dr. Seuss role in his grave; this is a film is not worth watching, and must be locked away to never be seen again, and just be forgotten by humanity.Everything Bad About It:The film lacks understanding of what made the original book by Dr. Seuss so good. And I hate the film for this. It just thinks that Dr. Seuss's works are just simple kids books. Even though it should've been treated with a little more respect. Dr. Seuss is more than just something that just wrote kids books. He was a man full of creativity, who wrote truly great stories.And this film doesn't get why people love, it just knows that people love them, and it wants to cash in on that fact. Now, I have nothing wrong with making money off it. Film making is a business. But that's no excuse for mediocrity, or making such passionless drivel.From the forced adult jokes, to all the other kinds of jokes that don't land, and the hideous looking sets and costumes. Everything about the film is atrocious. Mike Myers sucks as the title character, the performance is not funny. And the costume is scary looking. And speaking of that. The film shouldn't have been live action. It should've been animated, as Dr. Seuss's drawing style really doesn't translate well to live action films.Also, the abundance of adult jokes in this film simply raises an eyebrow. There are very on the nose adult jokes in this film, and while I don't mind adult jokes in kids films, I mean, I love Shrek. The movie simply has jokes that aren't subtle enough. And Shrek was based on a weird children's book. This film is based on Dr. Seuss, so having these kind of jokes just feels wrong.The film also fails as an adaptation following the book so rarely, and barely having a message. The book had a message that a little rule breaking okay as long as you don't go too far. That's a unique message for a story like that. But this film just forgets about it completely.Conclusion:What else can I really say? The comedy falls flat. It fails as an adaptation. It fails as a kids movie. And it just fails as a film. If I could give it a 0/10, I would. This is one of my five least favorite films. And deserving of the worst kind of hatred. And there is so much I haven't touched on, but I don't wanna spend all night talking about this film.",The Cat in the Hat
70,andyajoflaherty,Great film for kids,7,4 July 2020,"Despite being critically panned I actually think this is a pretty enjoyable kids film.

73,KathleenK22,Great movie to watch with the grandkids,10,14 August 2018,"We love this movie. We have been watching it with grandchildren for for ten years or more. Each time we all laugh and laugh. It does not get old. It is up there with Elf as a family favourite. When a five year old watches the whole movie without wandering off it must be pretty good.
The acting is great from the children and adults and some of the jokes stand alone and are repeated by adults and children randomly long after watching the movie for the umpteenth time.
Giving a movie like this a 1 says a lot about the reviewer. No sense of humour? No children to share it with? No appreciation of any aspect of the movie? I feel sorry for anyone who would give it below a 6!
The colours are bright and the two kids are wonderful and learn lessons from their interactions with the cat.
The neighbour and boss are characters who add humour and interest. The mother is attractive and the whole set is stylistic. 
The star would have to be the cat wonderfully portrayed by a well known actor.
Overall, it is a nice light funny movie to enjoy with kids. Judge it for what it is. It would cheer up a sick kid or entertain the family with young kids. 
Enjoy!",The Cat in the Hat
74,mwendel,I believe Dr. Seuss is still rolling in his grave. (Spoilers),5,18 February 2004,"This just might possibly be the worst film adaptation created based upon, or inspired by, a book in the history of film itself.  The Cat In The Hat will, thankfully, survive this ridiculous excuse for a movie.  While the Cat In The Hat himself will live on as a timeless children's favorite this movie will hopefully be quickly forgotten and have the DVD copies put into a trash compactor.What they did to The Cat In The Hat is unforgivable.  Adult themes.  Blatant commercialism, including a shameless plug for Universal Studios (I wonder how much that set them back) and the pop music they put on the soundtrack for the movie.  The jokes might have been funny if this movie wasn't supposed to be based upon the Cat In The Hat.  Mike Meyers performance might have been considered brilliant if this wasn't supposed to be a movie about one of the most beloved child characters ever.  But we can't say that because this movie was a travesty.The twisting of the Cat in The Hat to a perverted, ill humored, chaos weaving creature that appeared to be ready to take a baseball bat to a small child, is unbelievable.  The Cat making jokes about whores, and nearly giving a tongue bath to a garden hoe in the same 2-second bit?  What were they thinking?  Obviously they didn't think about much.The movie would probably terrify most small children, whom you would have expected this movie to be targeted towards.  This is not a movie to take the kids to or to show them on video/DVD.  This movie should be shown in every film school in the world as a shining example of how to not make a child's storybook into a movie.  I could say more but I'll give myself and ulcer and I'll need some Tums.All I can say is this movie was pitiful.  I'd rather watch Leonard Part 6 again instead of this garbage.",The Cat in the Hat
75,zombiefan89,I cried...It was that awful.,1,22 April 2013,"If Dr. Seuss were still alive, he would be VERY disappointed in Hollywood. It's the Cat in the Hat! How do you screw that up!? Mom leaves her kids alone, and a cat shows up. Together with Thing 1 and Thing 2, he causes all sorts of mischief, creating a big mess. Then, when the kids tell him to leave, he feels bad, comes back with a cleaning machine, and fixes everything back to the way it was. Mike Myers, in that horrible costume, was terrifying. Shameless advertising, adult humor, and sexual innuendo had no place in that movie! People were expecting children's movie and ended up with Austin Powers in a freaky cat suit! The bottom line is, in terms of ""kid"" movies, it's a God awful abomination, and needs to be burned. Just read book or watch the classic cartoon.",The Cat in the Hat
76,shimenpf,It's a mess,4,3 February 2019,"The movie has a lot of things going on and nothing at the same time. The story is boring because there is never a feeling of stakes, and te obstacles never feel real. Don't get me wrong, a big talking catman isn't very real, but there's a screenwriting maxima that says you're only allowed one lie. After that, you must tell the truth parting from that lie.

This is not a christmas movie.   It probably has been promoted as such for marketing, which is never an indication that you are about to see a great movie.It simply is not funny enough.  The movie can not, literally, spell fun. That is not my opinion alone.  The audience I saw it with was not impressed either.That said, it has enjoyable moments and is not devoid of meaning.  It seems really targeted at the 8-14 audience.As for the FX, OK, but nothing special.  Nor is the audio anything special. So bad, in fact, that the movie has Meyers making fun of it.  And that is pretty much the highlight of Meyers humor.  He is much funnier bald than in fur.  The Looney Tunes folks could improve their movies significantly by hiring him as Elmer Fudd.",The Cat in the Hat
79,saint405,Cat in the horrible movie,3,23 June 2005,"Dr. Seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive. Cat in the Hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, big mistake! Myers proves he can't act in this film. He acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. The kids in this movie are all right, somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying. The story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never tweak with the original story! Bringing in the evil neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life.This movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it. The film sure does look tacky! Sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word, mildly funny. At least the Grinch had spunk, and the film was actually good! This film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting. Was Mike Myers even in this movie actually? And another thing, the fish. What is with that stupid fish! First time you see him, he's an actual fish. Next time you see him, he's all animated and talking. But he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough! This film is a total off target wreck. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke, that was good. So please if you have the choice, watch the Grinch instead of this mess.",The Cat in the Hat

81,filmbuff-36,Would I watch this film again? Not a chance my brainwashed friend!,4,1 December 2003,"Picture it - the studio heads at Imagine Entertainment swimming through the profits they made on ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" when one executive suddenly had an epiphany. The studio can make another movie based on a Dr. Seuss story, hire another popular comedian and they'll have another hit on their hands.Well, they probably will but it's doubtful children will leave ""The Cat in the Hat"" with the same feeling of awe and wonder that they did with the previous Seuss adaptation. The movie is suffering from an entertainment deficiency, loaded with over-the-top special effects and a funhouse production design but filled with characters who all seem lost in the excess.Real estate agent Joan (Kelly Preston) will be hosting a house party for agency clients in the evening. Unfortunately, her rambunctious 12-year-old son Conrad (Spencer Breslin) has a knack for disobeying rules and she fears he'll wreck the house before she returns. Grounded for making a mess in the kitchen, Conrad must stay home with a baby-sitter along with his 9-year-old control freak sister Sally (Dakota Fanning) who does not want to play with kids she views as immature.The baby-sitter soon falls asleep leaving Conrad and Sally alone on a rainy day. Before boredom can really set in however, a mysterious creature invades their home, The Cat in the Hat (Mike Myers). Upon arrival, the Cat quickly tries to help the two kids have fun around the house while two-faced neighbor Larry Quinn (Alec Baldwin) schemes to hook up with the mother and boot out Conrad to military school.Situations escalate as the Cat's pranks lead to destruction and the escape of the family dog. The kids and the Cat must retrieve the runaway canine from Quinn and contain the mess that's been made in the house before Joan gets back home.The original book by Dr. Seuss did not really have much of a plot, just a scenario about a magical cat relieving the boredom of a rainy day. Because of these humble origins, the movie is for the most part aimless. There is no true rhyme or reason for much that happens in the movie, just a series of things that seem to be happening on screen.To make up for the limited story in the book, the movie is filled with numerous subplots to pad out the time, like a journey into town and a trip through the now magically deformed house, none of which adding anything meaningful to the original story.This might not be too bad if the movie at least had good characters to fall back on, but as it is the main players don't seem to know what to do with themselves. What's left is just an empty Hollywood product, filled with noise and spectacle but no heart.As the Cat, Myers seems to be invoking a strange mixture of The Cowardly Lion and Willy Wonka. Part con artist, part entertainer and part nut case, Myers at least seems to be having a lot of fun in costume. For the first 45 minutes, the Cat almost carries the entire movie on his own.But the Cat is never a likable person, and in reality Myers seems to be back on ""Saturday Night Live"" in an overlong skit spoofing the character instead of actually playing him. In the book the Cat was whimsical and accident prone, but never really dangerous. Here he seems to delight in placing himself and the children in jeopardy. I don't know about you, but I'm sure Dr. Seuss never wanted the Cat to brandish a knife and threaten a doppelganger that ""I'll get you! And I'll make it look like an accident!""Earlier this year I lauded ""Dickie Roberts"" for having somewhat realistic kids given the weird situation. The same praise cannot be said here. These are the epitome of Hollywood children - the type of brats who deserve a serious punishment but are spared the rod because they learn their lesson in the end. Cue the sentimental music.Fanning, a young rising star in films like ""I am Sam"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is not given much character here. Where she was once bright-eyed and happy, now she's desensitized and apathetic. Breslin is a loudmouth to no end, and I was secretly hoping he would have been sent to military school.Baldwin actually gives the best performance in the movie. He's not really funny but at least he plays his character appropriately given the scenario. Also, his character Quinn doesn't rely on an 11th-hour cop-out to win over audience respect like the others do. He's evil, but in an old-fashioned fun way.If ""The Cat in the Hat"" is a big hit, expect other Dr. Seuss books to be turned into movies in the future, and dread them. This movie may entertain the young, but older audiences will storm out of theaters disillusioned at the terrible hoax that has been played on them.Four out of ten stars. There is nothing here worthy of the book that has been a childhood favorite for decades.",The Cat in the Hat

My nephews really love the film and are always asking if they can borrow the film. Mike Myers, Alec Baldwin, Kelly Preston, Dakota Fanning, Spencer Breslin, Amy Hill and everyone else were fantastic. You can only read books or just look at the pictures that are not real but you can actually see the film that makes it much more real. It is very funny and has a good storyline.

Kind if in the way that ""Citizen Kane"" is seriously marvelous. I'm talking serious. Mike Myers ""cat"" was funnier back in 1939 when it was Bert Lahr. Similarity was freakish.I'm always amazed how Kelly Preston gets work. Must be the push-up. If there was a ray of light at all, it was in Alec Baldwin in the last scene of the movie.

This version is not that film.The production people did an excellent job but I suspect they lacked inspired direction.  On occasion, I wondered whether I was watching the film versions of 'Popeye' or 'The Flintstones'.  Sets and design overpowered what amounts to a simple story.

85,bonniejoy-978-68763,Spit in Dr. Seuss' Face,1,2 May 2014,"Who dares call this piece of crud Dr. Seuss related? This whole thing has nothing to do with Dr. Seuss! It was like whoever wrote it took the book, flushed it down the toilet, and resurrected it as crud!So the kids, Conrad and Sally, are each a rule breaker and a control freak. Uh, isn't the Cat in the Hat enough of a rule breaker already? And the Cat is nothing like the original Dr. Seuss version. Sure he comes up with games and wrecks the house in the process, but he adds sexual innuendos, obnoxiously constant 4th wall jokes, and looks more like a man dressed in a heavy Cat Halloween costume. I don't blame the make up artist necessarily, but I bet Jim Carrey would do better in that costume than Mike Myers did. And that's another thing that bugs me; it's Mike Myers, not the Cat. Everybody knows it's Myers under that cat suit. (maybe that's a bit picky) Oh and the one line he gives that automatically spits in Dr. Seuss' face is: ""Why I'm the Cat in the Hat; there's no doubt about that! I'm a super fun differs feline, who's here to make sure that you're..........meline?.........keline?.........terpentine? I got nothing; I'm not so good with the rhyming, not really."" Let that sink in. The only thing to rival the Cat's obnoxiousness are......the Things. Yeah, in the book they're so adorable, fun loving, and do the kind of fun I'd want to do! Here in the movie, they're creepy looking (what's up with the Marge Simpson hair?), super annoying, and why does Thing 2 have to clarify with the 4th wall that his name doesn't downsize him or that just because he's Thing 2 that it doesn't mean he's second best? Nobody needed to know that! In fact almost all the 4th wall jokes were so obnoxious that it took away from the story. The rest of the characters: Oh I hated them! The mother was okay, the kids were bland, the boss was an idiot, the babysitter (who mixed Mrs. Doubtfire with too much makeup and made her such an offensive stereotype?), the villain: Oh he's the worst! I think the writers deliberately tried to make him look like a jerk in every way possible, so they threw in him being nice to the mother, but behind her back be cruel (if you can call it that) to the kids, and being attractive on the outside but inside he's disgusting. The story didn't need a villain; the book by itself had no need for antagonists (unless the Cat is considered one, I don't know) but that was what was nice about the story. It was a simple at home story where the Cat comes and wrecks the place in wild ways that our parents would never have approved of. He didn't need a contract to give out forbidden fun or clean up afterwards; it almost felt as if the writers didn't know what to write so they just took from the garbage can whatever they could find and throw it at the story.Another thing I found shameful was all the innuendoes, filthy humor, inserting swearing (in a KID'S film) and terrible jokes. None of them have to do with Dr. Seuss. For example, the Cat lusts over Conrad's mother when looking at her photo (Dr. Seuss?), him mooning at the camera, (Dr. Seuss?) he yells, ""Dirty hoe!"" while holding one (Dr. Seuss?), getting smashed in the most painful place (Dr. Seuss??), and I can't believe this one: the S.L.O.W. or Super Hydraulic Institanious Transmitter (DR. SEUSS??????) I could just punch the screenwriters for deliberately inserting dirty humor and swearing in a kid's film! This doesn't shape their childhood, rather it rapes their childhood - how can they not see that?! Though I will give this movie credit: the sets still look like Dr. Seuss land if nothing else and are more enjoyable than anything else in the film, and the only character I shamefully enjoy is the fish. I say shamefully, because I'm suppose to enjoy the Cat and the kids but because they have no character development or anything valuable to watch, the fish is more enjoyable. He tries to convince the kids (in almost the same way in the book) that the Cat needs to leave, also the surrounding jokes (even from Myers) are hilarious. Tragically there's nothing else to enjoy or be proud of.The Grinch may not have been the best Dr. Seuss film, but you know what? I'd rather see the Grinch than this flick in the face! At least Jim Carrey had more energy and better character acting than Mike Myers as the Cat. Stick to Shrek, Myers.",The Cat in the Hat

89,Filvies144,Worst Dr Suess adaptation,4,10 September 2015,"Even worse than that already terrible Grinch movie! Dr. Suess is rolling is his grave for both of these bad adaptations! This movie starts out very dull, the special effects are shoody, the cat (played by Mike Myers) only tells a couple of funny jokes, but exaggerates them in a poorly executed way and some are a bit inappropriate. As a result, very little loyalty to the book. Thing one and thing two are just CREEPY, and the costume for the cat is bad. Its pretty obvious it made it to the Razzies. This film was a complete waste of time and is truly terrible. Watch the Lorax or Horton hears a who instead. By the way, this was actually the reason both of them were animated, because this live action film was so terrible! The only reason it got any stars was because a couple of the jokes were funny like I said, and the special effects aren't as bad as some other films.",The Cat in the Hat
90,pwoods1,Even the sandbox smells,2,7 August 2004,"Dr Seuss would be balancing a damn sight more than balls, books, rakes, whatever on the cat's nose; on the cat's ability to juggle this stinker.It really isn't Mike Meyers' comedic talent. Goodness knows it's there. It ain't the kids, it ain't the script. What is it? It's the stupidity of jokes like: ""Oh! She's a 'ho. I love her but..."" (or whatever). Cheap shots like the hoe joke don't belong in Dr Seuss; indeed, they don't belong in this movie.Oh dear! Electric cars? As green as they are painted, they are Ford Focuses - check the badging. A Ford Focus is NOT electric and certainly not green. A Toyota... well, a Prius, possibly. Product placement, thy name is money or possibly Baal or something else. It certainly ain't an electric car.What makes more sense than most of this travesty is the inclusion of the deleted/extra scenes (which add more sense given their continuity) and the out-takes. OK. Some of them are funny. BUT some of them indicate that specific actors didn't learn their lines. Continually 'screwing-up' during a shoot with children does not excuse the use of the 'f' word. One doesn't wish to point the finger, but, f**k and s**t, appeared to be in constant use on the set.Regardless. This attempt to translate ""The Cat in the Hat"" to the screen fails. It fails dismally. Someone should shoot both writers and director.",The Cat in the Hat

But now coming to the 2000s we get some good movies and some bad movies and this has to be one of them The cat in the hat it was pointless the CGI effects where really poor and as for the actors here we have Mike Myers Alec Baldwin Amy Hill these are both famous actors and they are really lack off in this film they where better in other films but not this one and the other thing I have to say the cat's hat its like Inspector gadget with all these gadgets coming out this is why the movie gets a 3 but all Theo it did have a few good moments but they could not save this film any way it was a pretty poor film This movie is problay great for kids but people over 10 are going to be bored if you want a good movie then go and buy Herbie fully loaded.

I suffered through about half of the movie in my home. So, to be quite frank, I cannot tell you how the second half of the movie goes or how it ends. It is immaterial. Thankfully, I was also not watching this movie (I use that term loosely) on a airline flight. I just may have asked for a parachute and taken my chances. This movie was a piece of crap from the opening credits. i will not bother to look up the names of the supporting casts, because they do not deserve to be looked up for anything, except maybe to have their acting cards revolved. Yes, i understand they were just reading their lines. Oh, man, do I realize they were just reading their lines. It begins and ends with Myers. I usually enjoy his work. I don't understand what he was thinking or doing. Possibly, he read too many of his press clippings and thought he could just throw out anything and the public would buy it. I hope he lost money because this project doesn't deserve to earn anything positive. The kids in this piece of garbage were very annoying, and very amateurish.

94,doruksesli,Wow,10,8 September 2021,"Cat in the hat is an absurd, surrealist representation of psychological breakdowns and the tolls of isolation as well as pressure. It also handles subjects like pedophilia and sociopathic psychologies, it's also a great example of what hallucogenics can do to people. A tale of greed, desire, pride and lust. A true cinematic masterpiece, one that asks many questions most filmmakers wouldn't dare go near. One that is a perfect example of amazing production design and true absurdist surrealism with a touch of psychosexual nihilism and black comedy. A true masterpiece, to say the least. The Cat In The Hat is a cinematic achievement like no other and must be viewed by anyone who has any respect for this art form that we allow to be such a huge part of our seemingly ordinary and pointless lives.",The Cat in the Hat

I saw this movie on a field trip 3 years ago in grade 3 and loved, even today(I'm going into Grade 6)i find it funny. its fun, great, and a total classic. People are just giving bad ratings. Thats the critics. The critics just can't get a hold of themselves and can't give a good rating to any movie out there. This movie i think will be memorable, at least to me. I'm trying to get my dad to watch it with me, it still hasn't worked yet so I'm gonna keep trying. He's watched 2 parts and I know he felt like laughing.Another thing i hate about these comments is that all they say is,""I hate this movie, it sucked, it was horrible, pure crap, and all this other stuff about the movie. When they tell people don't see it? How are people supposed to see this movie if they think it sucks. What if one person will like it.

99,mrtimlarabee,This is vile,1,24 March 2008,"Children's movies of late are an interesting lot. They try to have kid appeal with non threatening plot and humor while trying to sneak in enough for adults to keep their attention while being dragged to the multiplex. Some of that type of humor is really clever and not so offensive that sharper kids who spot them won't be offended.There is, however, a difference between smart humor and downright crude, vile humor. ""The Cat in the Hat"" falls in the latter category. This film is the most vicious sick form of kid's entertainment I've seen in years. I would have not watched if it weren't for the fact that it was playing at kid's pizza place that I was attending with a child at the time.There are a number of scenes where the children just stare at the cat pulling off one crude gag after another. Bodily function humor abound, I'd have the same reaction. Then there are SO many other scenes that have coarse adult humor. No, it isn't sly innuendo, it's sick. The sad part is, it's not even funny. I watch a slew of animated films and if it's smart adult humor that goes over the head of the little ones, that's fine. But this is sick.The plot is similar to the book. Seuss's words in the book are magical. The plot and message are simple. The kids fall prey to mischief - how do they clean up before mom gets home. How that gets screwed up is beyond me, but this film does it. Innocent mischief, this isn't.While we're on the subject of inappropriate adult humor, let me point out that this film FEATURES PRODUCT PLACEMENT FOR AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE. Sickened yet? Try Mike Myer's insipid performance of the title character. This is vile and a miserable excuse for children's entertainment.",The Cat in the Hat
100,toonyjakes,It really becomes redundant,4,24 July 2018,"The Cat In The Hat was not a bad movie seeing it as a child. I thought it was zany, and interesting to finally see a great short story come to life. That's different for me 15 years later.I just watched this randomly with my roommate today, getting nostalgic, and realized that this movie is nothing but a vehicle for Mike Myers' comedy. That would be fantastic if it wasn't poorly written, with a story that completely spins off the rails just to do it. By the time you get to the part where the house gets cleaned, you finally remember the actual story. Plot- The story takes the same basis as the book, but honestly might even miss some pages in terms of what happens. It just becomes one mess, one gag after another with two kids standing there watching. Total excessCharacters- Alec Baldwin is probably the most interesting character alongside Mike Myers in the lead, but the rest are just people. A weird sleepy babysitter, a cookie cutter surburban mom, one good kid, one bad kid. Just enough to make you watch. Dialogue- Really no memorable lines, there are some decent Mike Myers trademarks that'll make you laugh. The musical numbers are cringe worthy. The pacing is so bland it feels like a 1950's Coke commercialProd. Value/Quality- The movie is eye popping, a very unique setting. The cinematography is not bad at all, pretty crisp for a movie that seems like it was hurried.Overall I laughed about five times, and the rest left that weird feeling in my stomach, like I either have to eat or just walk away. It is likeable, just not by someone who looks for good thematic elements, originality in movies. Your kids will like it.",The Cat in the Hat

102,forrestwrs,There's No Rhyme Or Reason,1,12 September 2010,"The Cat in the Hat with Mike Myers is the perfect family movie for a family of lobotomized coma patients. I will say this for the movie: whenever Mike Myers broke from the structure of the film and his character to just be Mike Myers, he was kind of funny. As in a chuckle here, a snicker there.And that's it with my praise with this film.There is not an actor on screen in this film who is interesting to watch, fun to watch, or tolerable to watch. From Mike Myers to Dakota Fanning and everyone in between, the cast in this movie had no idea what they were doing.Even the visuals were bad. I don't just mean that they were poorly done; they physically hurt my eyes to look at them. There's so much brightness without any contrast. There's no rhyme or reason to the way the art direction was done. It was just all a bunch of bright pinks and bright oranges.There's also a CGI fish in this movie. He looks awful. I don't know who the designer for that fish was, but I think it was his goal to scare the children. Of course, the exact same could be said for the designer for the Cat costume. They look genuinely frightening. I'm sitting there watching the costumes in this movie--and not just the Cat, but even the kids'--wondering what drugs the designers were on to make them. They looked ridiculously bad. Not purposefully stupid, or corny in a good way, but a next level of terrible costuming that would give the costume designers for Battlefield Earth a run for their money. And then there's the script. I'm sorry, was this honestly meant for kids? There's problem number one. This movie is dumbed down to be aimed at children, but there's so much doo-doo in the script to make me think they wanted to cater more to adults. In the film, the Cat actually spells out the word ""sh*t."" They never say it, but any child who can spell--so any child over the age of six--can easily figure this out. Then there're the racist jokes. And the sexism. And the innuendos. A lot that is directed at the kids' Asian babysitter.This movie is deplorable. A hopelessly garish ""comedy"" aimed at children (adults?). Very seriously one of the worst films I have ever seen, the fact that this filth made it passed the producers is a mockery to any lover of film or Dr. Seuss. Or children for that matter.1/10",The Cat in the Hat
103,Grojniar,An Improvement To The Original Story,10,21 July 2021,"This was enjoyable before even starting, they put more work into the menu then some people do in their entire movie. The idea alone that Dr. Suess' vision could be brought to life physically seemed unlikely but I don't think this could have been done better. Not only were the visuals and sound remarkable but the changes made to the story improved it. Normally I hate child actors but they were amazing along with every other cast member.

The story has potential, but the issue is the stupid ""adult humor."" Adult humor is good in movies for adults or teens, but this movie is supposed to be for kids and kids will either question why their parent or sibling found that joke funny, while some parents get upset their kids heard this joke.

Those that have given it a poor review appear to have missed the point of this movie.The film contains childish humour to keep the kids happy, and plenty of double-entendres to keep the adults happy as well - without being crude.

If I had watched this in the theater I would have walked out on this garbage. In fact, I think I tossed the DVD out. Why Mike Myers would have anything to do with this complete insult is beyond me. The part where he belched up some dark stuff, farted, and then said he was lactose intolerant is reprehensible to say the least. I read where someone said that it was marketed towards children. My prior statement proves that that must be wrong. Not even the most despicable serial murderer would make something as unholy as this crap. While we are on the subject of serial murderers, I saw a biopic on Ted Bundy that was complete with some of the most horrendous things I have ever seen or could imagine. I would recommend that biopic before I would recommend this for children. Cat in the Hat with Mike Myers is a crime against humanity.",The Cat in the Hat

In this sad flick the world was cruel, The grownups leer and sometimes drool. They're cynical and clumsy too.* * * OK enough of that. But that's the main point. Suess presented a kindly world. This world was nothing but cynicism. That's why I quit the poem, could not come up with a good rhyme for cynicism.

109,ShadySovereign,This cat's 9 lives are over,1,30 April 2006,"The Cat in the Hat is yet another PG-rated film which defies the laws of film ratings. The movie is supposed to be a kid's film, but sneaks in some mild adult content to get laughs.This film is unfunny on all levels. Okay, there are probably one or two scenes that made me laugh, but the rest of the movie has stupidly unfunny jokes. Worst of all, the funny parts are supposed to be those that have the mild adult themes. I thought this was a FAMILY movie, not a sex comedy! I guess only those kids who are spoiled and are used to nudity & porn will like this movie. There is a cameo appearance by Paris Hilton, who has done a sex video before. Maybe those kids who watched her sex tape will love seeing her dance suggestively in this movie. They would also love the mild sexual jokes, since they would understand them. It is sickening to think about the young children knowing about all this adult stuff at a young age.The cat himself is very annoying. It seems that the filmmakers were trying to make him scary & funny at the same time. They were probably thinking of creating the cat as a Freddy Krueger carbon copy. Freddy is one thousand times funnier than this lame cat. In fact, Freddy could slice him up any time. I would get more laughs that way.And lastly, of course, this film has nothing to do with the Dr. Seuss books. It's no wonder that the fans of the Dr. Seuss series were angry at this movie. If I was a fan of those books, I would be angry too.To sum up, this film was really an insult to Dr. Seuss, to nursery rhymes, and to comedy itself. I despised this film on all levels, even if a few parts were funny. Watch this movie only if you're a kid who knows a lot about adult themes.I give this movie a 0/10.",The Cat in the Hat
110,jeev7882,Terrible,1,10 December 2003,"Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents don't be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake. There were numerous times I found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary.But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. The casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces. The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always likeable (or hateable in this case) Alec Baldwin are both good in their roles even though Preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this. The kids are conditioned actors and it shows, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen.Did I mention there was an oversized talking cat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable. I didn't like him as the voice of Shrek, and I truly believe now that Myers should not be allowed near the realm of children's films ever again. His portrayal of The Cat is a slightly toned down version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers.In the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if just for a day, he ruined 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and strife.The Cat in the Hat may be the worst kids movie ever.",The Cat in the Hat

Cat in the Hat has NO redeeming qualities and is really what I consider the final nail in the coffin that is Mike Myer's career.  Sure he'll make other movies, but anyone who believes he is a decent comedic actor at this point is sadly mistaken.  Even sadder, with all the cross promotion and the first week box office takes, it is virtually assured the studio will make money, thus assuring that the world will be subjected to more cinematic versions of Seuss books.

120,runner-15,"One word sums it all up, mediocre.",4,17 December 2003,"Minor joke spoilers. After reading bad review after bad review I had decided to not waste my time and money going to see this movie, but my wife had promised my nephew that she would take him to see it and I accompanied them only because I didn't want to spend the evening at home alone. A few points, first I loved the sets they were colorful and exaggerated, very Seuss-like. Kudos go out to Anne Kuljian for this great work.  Next most of the acting was very wooden not one single character was memorable except possibly for the fish, and he didn't get enough screen time. another Mike Meyers was just WRONG for the cat. Although Mr. Myers is a very capable comedic actor and I generally enjoy his performances. In this movie I just couldn't see the cat, all I kept seeing was Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard. Many people have complained about too much risqué comedy in this movie for it to be a PG rated movie on this point I must agree somewhat. I feel like this movie leans heavily toward the PG-13 rating and I believe this would have been a more appropriate rating. I don't think there were a lot of PG-13 jokes, but they were there, especially the hoe joke. As far as the baseball bat to the crotch, well anyone whatever their age will laugh at that one. Thing 1 and Thing 2,  Their facial make-up were almost exact copies of the Who in `The Grinch who stole Christmas ` that bothered me some. Mr. Humberfloob I just don't know there is something about his character that I like but at the same time, something I loath, overall I think this is a plus. The Quinn character had no redeeming qualities at all and I wanted to see get his comeuppance.  There are may other pluses and minuses to consider but when you've seen a movie and you have to examine it too closely to find what you liked about it something is inherently wrong. Is this move bad? No not in my book I don't think it deserves to be in the bottom 100. So is this movie good? No not by a long shot so what is left? Average, mediocre, ordinary, middling, run of the mill maybe even second-rate. Wait for it to come out on cable or satellite.",The Cat in the Hat
121,clarason-1,Hollywood Just Doesn't Get IT,3,22 November 2003,"Okay why was this movie so bad?  Was it the actors?  No (except for the cat being too much like Austin Powers).  Was it the set?  No.  Was it the writing?  Yes.This movie must have Dr. Seuss rolling over in his grave.Although it was nice to see the book finally in movie form.  But if you want to take your kids to this movie I would think twice before I did it.  At least only take kids that are too young to get the dirty jokes in this movie.Apparently Hollywood these days can't put out a film that isn't crude and rude anymore, not even a kids film.  Personally I found this film offensive to women.  There were at least 2 scenes that I think they should never have put into this movie and I cannot understand why they did or why they even thought they would be funny.",The Cat in the Hat

About 40, 45, 50 people were in the theatre. 20 of us left when it was over. The rest left mid-movie. If I wasn't cheap and was willing to lose money, I'd have done it also.I was so mad at everyone who said this movie was made for money, made for sponsors (Burger King, Radio Shack, Hallmark). Then I saw the movie. It was bad. The three papers around me gave it crappy reviews (half a star, one star, no stars). It was worse than that.There are no words for how bad this movie was. I loved ""The Grinch,"" and thought this could be as good. My, how wrong I was.

Mike Myers is terrible, even though I like him, he did a terrible job. The only person who saves it is Dakota Fanning as Sally. She was very good. I found one laugh in the film. When the Cat first meets Conrad and Sally, Sally asks where did the Cat come from, and the Cat responds with ""When a mommy cat and a daddy cat love each other very much"" etc. That part was actually quite funny for a movie that was horrible. It was torture to watch it, and was just plain stupid. I'm normally not a cynic, but I have to say, this was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Don't waste your money for renting or buying it.

This movie might be enjoyable by a few stoned-out 15-year-old boys, but I cannot imagine who else might like it.Yes, Mike Meyers is obnoxious. Is that what you like? Maybe you're a 15-year-old stoner. Do you think allusions to ""dirty"" words are the height of merriment? Perhaps this movie will make you merry.The animators and special effects creators who worked on ""Cat in the Hat"" probably were happy to have the paychecks, but I'm sure they were not happy that their worthwhile efforts were so dreadfully misused.As for Dr. Seuss, I pray he was dead before the release, because otherwise I expect he would have been horrified and deeply shamed. Whoever signed over the movie rights should be shot.",The Cat in the Hat
126,roythedog,Not the worst but not good either,3,2 June 2020,"First off I loved this movie as a kid but looking back on it now I see why a lot of people dislike it. I also read Doctor Seuss books as a kid but the 1970s Horton Hears A Who and The Lorax are still better then this, Jim Carrey's The Grinch was better then this. Jim Carrey usually portrays goofy, quirky, and eccentric characters. He was expressive enough to give a memorable yet somewhat cringeworthy performance even through a furry tight costume that he had to have techniques on how to resist torture taught to him by a navy seal.Mike Myers wasn't the right casting as the cat. Myers is better in animated roles or just being himself. Austin Powers and Shrek are good but he couldn't capture the magic he brought to those characters and this movie clearly tried to hide the fact that he was clearly sweating and about to pass out of heatstroke inside that cat suit.Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin gave no emotion to their characters and looked like they were only doing this because their parents forced them to do it for money. The only redeeming quality to this movie which is also kinda sad that it is, is the characters who weren't in the book and only in this movie. Sean Hayes gave a hilarious over the top performance as the crazy mysophobic boss of the kid's mother. He is honestly more funny then Mike Myers and maybe even would have done a better job as the cat. Amy Hill plays the kid's narcoleptic babysitter and although she is a shockingly offensive Chinese stereotype, the gags around her and some of her lines were funny. Alec Baldwin although clearly not happy and not caring one bit about the role and seeming to have only accepted it for a easy paycheck, did a surprisingly fine job as the gold digging piggish lazy messy neighbor. Aside from the toilet humor, Shameless marketing, and offensive jokes, this movie has a cheap generic pop song and generic happy ending. It's sad that the only saving grace are the non book characters.",The Cat in the Hat
127,roythedog,Horrible with only 1 redeeming quality,3,2 June 2020,"I will admit I enjoyed this movie as a kid. Watching it again now, I can see why it's so hated. I read Doctor Seuss books as a kid. I also really enjoyed the 1970s Horton Hears A Who and The Lorax short animated movies. I also did enjoy Jim Carrey's take on the Grinch. That movie wasn't good, but Carrey was expressive enough to work his way through that big furry Grinch costume. He gave a cringeworthy but very memorable performance. Myers was not the right casting for the cat.Myers isn't a bad actor, he has cemented his place in pop culture with Shrek and Austin Powers, but he couldn't bring the magic here. Every time he is on screen he looks like he about to pass out of heatstroke and is clearly sweating. There was 1 redeeming quality and it's sadly the one off characters that weren't in the book and only in this movie. I loved Sean Hayes' performance as the mother's mysophobic boss Hank Humberfloob. I also enjoyed Amy Hill's performance as Miss Kwan the narcoleptic babysitter. Alec Baldwin despite not caring one bit and seemingly only doing this for a easy paycheck, did give a good performance as the piggish and snobby neighbor.However, Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin's performances were wooden and boring with no emotion whatsoever. Aside from the shameless marketing, toilet humor, and tasteless jokes, this movie defiled what made Doctor Seuss great in the first place.",The Cat in the Hat
128,marc242,weird US-Kids'entertainment,1,22 November 2003,"I`m not that familiar with Dr.Seuss Books,but Mike Myers looks nothing like the Cat in The Hat. The movie has a similar production design like (obviously) ""The Grinch"" and the two ""Flintstones"" movies. Whats up with the americans,that they have such a fascination for live-action adaptations of their cartoons or childrens books? The result is almost always silly,weird, and in this case very frightening.
Myers tries hard to shine in his role,but he`s pretty creepy. The makeup does not transform him into a ""real"" creature like Jim Carrey in ""the grinch"",but makes him look more like what he actually is:  a  fat comedian/geek in a furry costume.Most of the humor is cynical, and fits a british comedy better than this one. The Cats analysis of the children,describing the girl as ""a control freak"" may sound funny at first,but does not belong in here.The Production design is allright,sometimes very bizarre,but feels too artificial most of the time.

The cat is just so cheerful and zany. It's just a great feel-good movie, and we've watched it heaps of times without getting bored with it. It doesn't follow the Zeus book a great deal, but in this case it works well for the film.It's extremely silly in the nicest possible way and makes you want to bounce on the sofa and always leaves me with a big grin on my face, which is extremely therapeutic and better than hitting the cooking sherry.I like this just as much as Mike Myers other stuff (that secret agent bod, I've forgotten his name), it's full of energy which energises me when I feel flat.

Yes, it's painful to watch, yes the acting (except for Myers) is horrible, Yes it's a complete destruction of the book...but i don't hate it. In fact, i feel kind of sorry for everybody involved in this movie. Mike Myers only had one other large live-action role after this, Alec Baldwin mostly works in animation nowadays, Dakota Fanning wouldn't be in a unanimously well received movie till a couple of years later, but the most affected victim was Bo Welch, the movie's director. Guess how many movies he's made? One. This one. So while it isn't a good movie, or even really a passable one...i can't really get too mad at it. I do like SOME of the humor, emphasis on SOME. Some lines do land, but those that don't are sadly far more noticeable. The story is garbage (some 4th graders fanfiction is probably better than this) but the visuals are nice....sometimes. Other times they look like a rejected theme park attraction. The music is...alright. Smash Mouth is a little jarring, considering another film that came out only a couple of years before also used Smash Mouth...i don't get it...

131,diegoavilarodriguez,Group Breaker Reviews: the cat in the hat,8,1 August 2010,"Well, I was 9 when I saw the film and I had read the book before this and so I was excited to see this film, in group breaker, I talk about films I didn't like but many loved and films I loved but many hated, this is where the cat in the hat comes in.Now first problem people have is that its targeted for kids and yet has some adult jokes like Super Hydrolic Instant Transporter (S.H.I.T) or when the cat says, dirty ho, people start thinking that this is a problem, but not really, I saw it when I was 9 and I didn't know what he meant til I was 13,the purpose of this film was to entertain children, I was a kid and laughed my ass off so job well done, it entertained them.Now speaking as a 17 year old, its still funny, but comedy is so subjective, you have to understand the type of humor this film has, though it may seem a little underrated for kids, most kids won't understand the joke and the ones that do will still laugh. If you like toilet humor, then you might enjoy this like I did. But know that as an adaption it doesn't seem that good, I mean after all, the book was so short it was hard to imagine it becoming a full length feature film, so obviously, characters had to be added, and other more things had to happen. And honestly, I have to say that if the film wouldn't of had the toilet humor it would have a dull children's movie, don't get me wrong its meant for children but the idea of the humor was so that it would be enjoyed by both children and young adults or teenagers, it would be like watching a winnie the pooh movie, only kids will find it amusing and we will just be seating for an hour and a half trying to make the best of it.Don't be so hard on this film just cause you're not into the humor, the film is good fun for the whole family.",The Cat in the Hat

Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat book holds a special place in my heart as one of my favorite children's books, so when I heard they were making a movie on it, I was so excited for it, but then my hopes when right down the drain when I actually started watching the film.The character of the Cat was unbelievably annoying, and he was also pretty rude and selfish. For example, when Sally wants to make cupcakes, the cat makes like a studio and the kids watch the cat do the cooking. That's selfish.The kids were a little bit more bearable, but I still didn't really enjoy much about them. They were so unlikable in the beginning, but at least they redeemed themselves at the movies end, and Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning portray that serious moment pretty well.And also, what was the point of having the Cat being the narrator for the movie at the end of the movie? That was so absurdly wrong, annoying, and overall a huge slap in the face to the original book! Stay far FAR away from this atrocity upon the masses!",The Cat in the Hat

It stunk at the end. It stunk in the middle - I'm warning you, friend. It stunk in the day and it stunk in the night. Any way you look at it this movie's not right.Ignore the movie and read the book.

It basically took all the worst parts of How the Grinch Stole Christmas and applied them to Cat in the Hat. Mike Myers has a few funny gags in the film but nowhere near enough to make it work. I don't think even kids would find this funny since there's a lot of adult-ish jokes that kids won't get, even 80 minutes worth of fart jokes and peeing dogs get old after a while.

137,skyisthelimit925,Childhood gem,9,9 August 2018,"First of all, it's really heartbreaking for me to see this awesome gem that taught me a lot when I was a little kid, being treated as one of the worst movies of all-time.The thing people do not understand about this movie is that it's a movie for children. If you experience it for the first time after you pass the age of 10 or something, of course it's easy for you to find it really annoying. The movie has a very unique way to tell everything and for that particular reason, I accept that it's not for all children, let alone every person. But to be honest, I didn't find the dark humor in it disturbing when I was a child in the first place. After watching it for the second time in college, the offensive things were more clear but still, it wasn't really disturbing.Other than all of that, the movie deserves more credit for what Mike Myers did with his role, if not anything. To be perfectly honest his performance is utterly underrated. He basically played a great version of the character in the book. I watched all the other movies that were inspired by Dr. Seuss books and I can't really say that they are 'that' better than this one. At least not a difference where this movie is the bottom 78th.Despite everything, the movie has a special place for me. It taught me to be responsible in a funny, interesting and exciting way.

The plot was messy, messy, messy! Its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was ""Mom"". They probably could have picked a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could have pulled it off if it weren't for Myers ugly, revolting over-acted portrayal of the Cat.I mean - did Myers even glance at a script?

It is rollicking fun from beginning to end, and not just for the kids!  My husband and I took our almost six-year-old granddaughter to see this new live action flick from Universal Pictures. I can't tell you who enjoyed it more  us or the kid! While our granddaughter smiled and recited the well-known lines from the book along with the on-screen narration, I was splitting my sides with the adult laughs. This movie is rated PG for `mild crude humor' but that didn't seem to bother anyone at the preview. 'The Cat in the Hat' is from the book of the same name. For most young readers, it's probably their favorite from Dr. Seuss. Add in a masterfully humorous screenplay by Alec Berg, glorious production design by Alex McDowell, magnificent set decoration by Anne Kuljian, fantastic costume design by Rita Ryack and the ultimate direction by former production designer Bo Welch  and the result is up to expectations. The special effects are phenomenal as is the cast. Top cat Mike Myers handles the title role and he is over-the-top hilarious in a fast moving whirlwind of action that will have you breathless.  There so much packed into this feature that you'll might feel the same way as our granddaughter, who said at the end, `Now I know what I'm going to do with the money I've been saving. I want to see it again and I'm going to buy the video when it comes out.'Alec Baldwin is memorable as the villainous Quinn. Handsome guy that he is, Alec has allowed himself to be shown as a super-slob complete with blubbery tummy.  At one point, he appears totally dipped in purple sticky goopy stuff. Kelly Preston, who is John Travolta's wife in real life, plays the sweet and shapely Mom.  The kids, Dakota Fanning as Sally and Spencer Breslin as Conrad, are fully up to the challenge of keeping up with the manic Myers.What an opportunity! It's a chance to savor and enjoy `Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat' in a whole newly embellished way. We loved it. You probably will, too.  Forget about the critics who don't like it --  they're just Grinches! Find a kid to take you or make up some other reason to go  but don't miss this feline fantasy.

On a very wet day two kids got real bored,Constantly saying what can we do OH LORD!!Their mother, a perfectionist their nanny asleep,They sat as they watched and said not a peep.
When all of sudden from the corner of their eye,Came a big fat cat to their surprise.The cat couldnt act even if he tried,But the kids went along to keep this a lie.
The humour was crude, the jokes were insane,As a matter of fact the whole movie a pain.Why do they do this? Why do they try?Nobody likes it, not even I.
The movies pathetic, pointless and lame,The movie and the book just aren't the same.the story's atrocious its really quite bad,You would pick the screenwriter to be insanely mad!!!
So what do I think about this small flick,If it were up to me I would burn it real quick.The jokes are quite shocking, the actors real bad,To pay to see this movie we too are also mad!!

It's crazy, zany, silly, scary in some parts, a bit of potty humor, and has just a few twists of kinky double innuendos enough to satisfy anyone.The humor is insane ! It REALLY is a good film that delivers on so many levels. Mike Meyers is perfectly cast for Cat In The Hat and the conflicting personalities of Concrete (no !) Conrad and Sally, the two kids, is darling to behold.And this film absolutely DELIVERS on special effects. It's a wild romp through a strange and amusing world as crazy and madcap as you can get. There's your classic comic parenting, good guy vs bad guy, a showdown, travel to another dimension, important lessons learned, and even more of the Cat's crazy antics, ego, and special effects.I'm really surprised that many people did not like this amazing rough gem.

The actors are all more than OK, especially The Cat, which is great, and the kids, who are very good. The make-up is terrific so the FX and CGI. It has very funny lines of dialog, the art feeds off on Pop Art, psychedelia and nonsense, and, the truth be told, it pays a good homage to them. This movie deserves unprejudiced viewers who love art in general and movies in particular better than mistreat a movie they did not were capable of understanding.See it with your children or see it alone, you will thank me for the recommendation.",The Cat in the Hat

Watching this movie when I'm now 19, yes, I have realized how bad it is lmao. BUT it's iconic and hilarious and has a lot of nostalgia factors from when I watched this so many times when I was younger. I still really love this movie and the cringe worthy jokes and random adult jokes that come with it.

Second, Was Mike Meyers supposed to look like a cat or a perverse human dressed up in a cat suit!?!? Third, and the most disturbing, were the ""adult"" jokes mixed in. This is a KIDS movie, a DR. Seuess movie!! There should be no hinting as sexual innuendo!!! I remembered that there were kids in the theater asking their parents ""What does that mean?"" This movie is supposed to be catered to kids! When over half the kids are walking out of the theater either crying (because they were scared of that cat-thing) or claiming, ""That movie was so bad!"", it's not a good sign.This movie is not that funny from any point of view. I got more laughs out of something called ""Cabin Fever"".

There was lots of laughter through the cinema all through the film when I went to see it this morning - from both the kids AND the mums and dads.Frankly, I think this film has been unfairly bashed by many, largely because of the fact that people are losing their sense of humour. Yes this film is silly. Yes this film is very stupid. But what on earth did you expect? Citizen Kane?!Why don't you take your children to see it.

154,GJBStar,A bit too silly,2,14 December 2003,"Following Jim Carrey in the Grinch, comes Mike Myers as Dr Seuss' The Cat In The Hat.  Whilst this film is remarkably colourful, costume design is good and it has the look of a Dr Seuss creation - it is quite possibly the only thing that Dr Seuss intended!The crux of whether this film was going to be good or not was whether Mike Myers could successfully pull off the role of the Cat.  Unfortunately, he doesn't.  I'd be suprised if there were not some kids scared by the look of the cat.  Furthermore, Mike Myers appears to be playing Dr Evil from Austin Powers dressed in a cat costume and he falls flat.However, this is not even the main fault - it's the humour.  For the most part, it is too childish to appeal to adults and at times, the innuendo may go a bit too far to be funny to children.  The only part of the movie that made me genuinely laugh was the infommercial parody.The other problem I had with the film was the supporting characters - I didn't find either of the kids or the parts played by Sean Hayes and Alec Baldwin particularly funny or likeable.  The shining light was Kelly Preston - who is reasonably good.  The narration is also a nice touch.Overall, its hard to say whether the mish-mash of styles and hunour will actually keep anyone entertained for the length of the film.  Overall, strange and quite bad.2 or maybe 3/10 (at a stretch).",The Cat in the Hat

The style and color coordination are just fabulous and adorable! So are the characters - even the despicable ones, like the boss, the boy friend, and the babysitter! Then there's the dialog and the action! I find it hilarious! I watch it over and over! I also like the subtle sexuality. Mom looks so hot, it's no wonder the Cat pops an instant boner when he sees her portrait, which he then turns into a centerfold and swipes right in front of her children.There are several other subtly sexual scenes, like the momentary clip of Paris Hilton dancing in a disco, and a closeup of mom's feet in high heels.This is such a visual, sensual, humorous and erotic feast, I was surprised to see it only has a three-star rating!

160,pfranklin,A Great Movie ... Too Many Just Don't Get It,10,24 October 2004,"I simply don't understand all the poor reviews on this film. I think it proves that many of the people who went to see this film had no idea of what to expect from Dreamworks and Mike Myers. If you like the Austin Powers movies you will really like this. No it wasn't some dumb children's Disney movie. It was edgy and had a more of a sophisticated interpretation of the original Dr. Seuss book. I'm guessing the problem is that most of those were expecting a re-enactment of the original children's book. And I doubt seriously Mike Myers or Dreamworks would do such a movie as that. My philosophy on movie and books is simply they are not one and of the same. The children's classic The Cat In the Hat was meant to be one of the first books a child could learn to read. It featured a wonderful use of colorful words to go along with the wonderful illustrations of that era of printed children's publishing. If that is what one expects then they would be best just stick to the classic original children's book. I would wager a bet that most of the parents who complained about this movie never bothered to give their children the book. Instead they just take their brats to the multiplex and expect them to have the same experience as actually reading the children's book.No this is a highly entertaining and humorous critic of modern American life. The character of Mr. Humberfloob (Sean Hayes) and Quinn (Alec Baldwin) along with the mom played by Kelly Preston and the two wonderful child actors do in fact present a satire of modern life. No, children like Sally did not have Palm Pilot organizers in the original book. And no the children in the original book were not as uptight and materialistic as those of 2003. So naturally the Cat (Mike Myers) had to be more sophisticated and edgy. Bottom line this movie is a view of modern day life in uptight urban America. It simply follows the storyline from Dr. Seuss's children's book. It was not meant to be a remake of the printed book. And if there are those out there that thought so then God help them. And unfortunately it seems this excellent movie is a waste for them because them are simply too dumb to get it.",The Cat in the Hat

If they wanted to make an adult version of cat in the hat they should have made it pg13 or R and just run with it that way. Instead of this weird ass hybrid that doesn't work for either age group. I'm pretty sure Dr Seuss is rolling in his grave over this mess. It wasn't even funny or clever it was just painful to watch.

This movie is a bit peculiar, but then again so is the book. As an interpretation of the book, I don't think it did so well, I think this movie is maybe a little frightening for the age it is meant for, also the jokes are rather crude and not many young children would understand them. The affects in this more are rather poor, as they really don't look real. The Grinch Who Stole Christmas is a lot better than this movie. I wouldn't say this Movie is awful, if it was just a movie and not an interpretation of the book, then yes it is a good movie, but as it is a interpretation it is not so good and really does not do the book justice. All in all, this is a good movie, but it is not one of the greats and certainly doesn't live up to the book. I think that some children may enjoy it but other may not.

First I have never read any Seuss and know hardly anything about his books. Second, I'm an adult who occasionally likes kids stuff because, well sometimes its just interesting. And I like the little bit of weirdness in it. This movie's visuals just sucked me in. I had no intention of watching it but the sets, the costumes, the effects, the use of color mesmerized me like, well a kid. I've rarely seen anything like that before. I thought Myers was hysterical. Dakota Fanning was adorable. Some of it fell flat. It was a flawed film. They never explained where he came from. But who cares. It was the kind of film that had to be short to be good and it was, just 1 hr 14 mts I think, and thats really short these days.

At times Mike Meyers is a little annoying as the Cat in the Hat, but I think he is meaning to be. There were a couple of times when his jokes fell flat, but by the reactions of the kids you knew they were supposed to. This movie does have a lot of sexual and adult innuendos, kind of like Shrek. This kids won't understand it though, so I didn't mind it. This was a cute movie, and was ultimately pretty good natured. The only REALLY big problem were Thing 1 and Thing 2. They weren't cute, but were just creepy. They gave me an awkward feeling. They needed some serious work. I do recommend this movie though.

177,EdnaWelthorpe,"Unacceptable, Unbearable, Unwatchable, UNFORGIVABLE!",1,29 April 2013,"Words cannot possibly express or comprehend how horrendous and downright foul this movie is...but I'll give it a shot anyway.The Cat in the Hat is one of the most beloved children's books of all times. A mischievous cat enters in on two bored children, causes some mischief but then cleans it all of and goes off into the horizon. A true classic. Which then begs the question how on earth someone with $165 million to spend could possibly look at the source material and produce this abomination.Why do I hate it so much? Well there's the fact that the characters are incredibly hateful. From the mother's hateful boss, the mother herself, the bratty brat played by Abigail Breslin's less talented sibling, Alec Baldwin's completely unnecessary character, the racist stereotype babysitter (I'll get to her) and of course, the cat himself.My congratulations to Mike Myers and the script writers, it takes a lot of effort to remove all charm and joy from Dr. Seuss's most beloved character but by god, they succeeded! Especially when they quickly say he doesn't do rhyming because the writers clearly stopped caring later on. Myers doesn't really play the Cat in the Hat as much as go through his shtick that in hindsight, should have warned us about the dated and repetitious Goldmember movie. And let's talk about the jokes. They're horrendous, hateful and shockingly crude. From the Cat ogling a picture of the mother and opening like a playboy centerfold, the grotesque racial stereotype -- Mrs. Kwan and outright physical abuse they put her through (line from the move -- ""we're riding Mrs. Kwan""), and the swearing. Now I'm all for free use of our vocabulary but seeing the Cat drop the f-bomb and s*** is very disheartening. Not to mention all the penis jokes, butt jokes, cross-dressing, death threats, and the worst attempt at fourth wall humor to justify blatant product placement. And speaking of blatant pandering, Paris Hilton has a cameo and Myers dances with her -- WHY ON EARTH IS Paris HILTON IN A DR. SEUSS MOVIE!? I could go into the bad plot, forced dilemmas and inconsistent faithfulness and use of Dr. Seuss's work and prose but the above pretty much established there was no hope for something like plot to save this travesty.I hate this film, I really, really, really hate this film. I haven't worked out an order for my most hated films but this is in the top three. No wonder Dr. Seuss's widow was so disgusted with this film that she did the world a favor by pulling the plug on future live-action adaptations of Dr. Seuss. And given that she's had the Lorax shill for Mazda, that's really saying something.OVERALL: To borrow/steal a line from the late great Roger Ebert describing ""Battle: Los Angeles"", ""If your friend likes this, they're idiots, if your date likes it, you need to tell them that it's time to consider seeing other people, and if someone tries to show it to your young children, have them barred from ever being around a minor.""",The Cat in the Hat
178,rjackson7,1 of the funniest movies ever,10,9 March 2005,"I couldn't stop laughing all the way through this movie, and it hasn't worn off despite repeated re-watchings on DVD. This movie is an overnight cult classic - I say ""cult"" because most people probably have a few too many sensibilities against ""silliness"" to realize how utterly hilarious it is.The comedy is primarily satire, and it went over the heads of my 2 and 5 year old daughters - its aimed more at the 8+ child. But even for the tots, there is nothing subversive/violent/explicit that they will possibly be able to detect.One thing that no-one anywhere has mentioned is this movie's greatest strength. Yes, Bo Welch melded the scenery and costumes brilliantly and Mike Myers never misses a beat. But the reason this movie is brilliant is due to its PACING. The editor should receive an Oscar, and I say that sincerely.Dr Seuss forces you to read his books briskly - he makes you get caught up in his silliness and whimsical rhymes. Most people just fight against the text and read it slowly, thereby making the books devoid of life and zaniness. This movie captures the poetry and style of Seuss' timeless book in a way that is *supposed* to be impossible! The perfect pacing of the movie mirrors Seuss' works brilliantly - this movie is a unique and brilliant cinematic achievement.I'm shocked that so few appreciate it. Of course it has no plot - it's a whimsical journey of fantasy. If Seuss were to be judged on plot, all his books would be rubbish. But in fact, they are timeless classics, with a unique ability to show children the power of language to elevate and inspire you.

I wanted a live-action Green Eggs and Ham. But now we can't get that. Because of this movie. When they made this movie they didn't care!The movie is lazy, mean-spirited, not funny in the least. It's nasty... Because of the sexual jokes. It's awkward because all of the actors act awkward, they act uncomfortably and deliver the lines in monotone. And last but not least it's a cash grab. They actually put a plug for Universal Studios in the movie. So all in all this movie was just a failure all across the board. And I'm holding Mike Myers responsible for that. This failure falls at the feet of Mike Myers! It's Mike Myers fault for playing in it... The screenplay writers who wrote this trash.

As the titular cat, Mike Myers talks in his ""Linda Richman"" voice, with maybe a little Bert Lahr thrown in for good measure. His catch phrase is ""Oh yeah"" just like the smiley Kool-Aide pitcher. The character is unappealing and can't perform Dr. Seuss' rhyming--just crude jokes and bleeped out cursing. My favorite part is when the children at a party mistake him for a piñata and beat his furry behind with baseball bats. I'm still not entirely convinced that Dakota Fanning is not a midget.

Mike Myers is superb as the cat and pulls off a character that is uniquely hilarious, as do the children and Alec Baldwin.  Best of all though it manages to swerve the usual pitfall that most Disney live-action films fall into, which is to lose all the comedy at the end in favour of a sickly sweet resolution.   In short do not be put off by the trailer (in no way does it do the film's humour justice) or the general word of mouth.

205,dimonosads,It deserved Golden Raspberry,4,15 January 2012,"I wasn't familiar with The Cat in the hat original book. However, there was definitely no need to read through it understand how poor this movie is.It is difficult to judge the plot of the movie, because it is based on children's book. One might notice that the narration of the movie is similar to the one that is introduced in ""Grinch"" - thus it already shows itself as a fairy tale for young children. Nonetheless, one feature is distinct in this movie - constant references to sex, clubs, drugs, alcohol and tobacco. And that's inside a kid's movie. Why in the Earth a movie, which is intended for smaller audiences contains that? And no, it does not make the movie more appealing to more mature audiences.We shouldn't forget that this is a comedy. There were one or two funny gags to laugh at and.. that was it. And the major reason of the movie being unfunny was the annoying cat.I wouldn't say Mike Myers performance was that terrible. In fact there are many other actors that have static facial expressions and inappropriate emotions in several moments. But, he still manages to portray the cat as an annoying douche. His laugh is as irritating as if someone would try to cut a glass with a knife. Anyone would be happy to stab this cat with the same knife. The fat bastard doesn't deserve any mercy.Overall, this might have been a much better movie if it didn't struggle to reach a wide range of audience and instead stick to youngsters.

206,Cyberbob8385,It serves its purpose in movie history,6,17 March 2004,"The Cat in the Hat, while not a very good movie, serves its purpose well. It is meant to be a silly movie, as it is.  It is meant to be a movie acceptable for younger children, as it is.  However, it lands on the border of being 'too' goofy.  Then, there are parts that are possibly meant to be funny, but just come across as ignorant and crude.  While this may add humor in some people's minds, for me, it isn't as much funny as just goofy. (Goofy being used to mean silly antics, while funny is used to mean actual humor that makes the audience laugh.)To sum up, The Cat in the Hat is fairly true to the book, though has a hard time meeting the standards set by the book, due to the excessive goofiness, while at the same time, not actually being quite funny enough in some parts.",The Cat in the Hat

Because my daughter, who was four at the time, absolutely loved it, we have since acquired it on DVD, and it has grown on me. It's actually a fairly decent film. The Cat seems to be a hairy version of the best bits of Myers's Dr. Evil character. That's really the only downside, in my opinion. I would have liked fresher material from him.

208,marygracelia22-926-448565,My Guilty Pleasure - 'The Cat in the Hat' (2003),8,24 December 2017,"It does not require a lot of work to realize that this film is not generally held in high regard, among both film-goers and critics alike (its metascore here on IMDB is 19/100). For some reason, however, this is one of my favourite films from my childhood (I know, shocking isn't it), and I would like to share this reason with you and try to understand why other reviewers hate it so much.I would like to begin by saying that I have never read a story by Dr Seuss, something I hope to amend very soon. A lot of reviewers have compared this film to the original story by this story, which may explain why they have criticized it so harshly. They say it doesn't capture the original's tone and spirit and is, therefore, meant only to capitalize on its name and popularity without any actual effort put into the film itself. I beg to differ for a number of reasons based on one fact, to what extent does an adaptation has to remain loyal to the original that inspired it? I would argue that an adaptation has no obligation to be loyal to the original and so any argument comparing the two should not be to the detriment of the adaptation. This is my first point. Some reviewers have also complained that it uses certain language which is not appropriate in a children's film or story, like ""Son-of-a-b**** (bleep)!"", ""That chaps my a** (bleep)!"" and ""Dirty hoe... I'm sorry, baby. I love you!"". Yet these words are bleeped out and in the case of the word 'hoe', which is not bleeped out, its meaning is certainly not implicit to a young viewer. This is not a reasonable argument for me, there were a lot of sexual innuendos in a lot of children's cartoons and TV series before and yet nobody bothered to complain. And anyway, let's be realistic, a child cannot understand these jokes in the first place.Mike Myers is phenomenal as The Cat, I always find him to be absolutely hilarious and he really does try in this. The part where the kid hits him with the bat in the party when he is disguised as the Piñata always has me in stitches. I also love all the puns, some of which are ingenious and which I only understood after multiple viewings. An example is: ""The Cat: (showing his car) Here she is, the Super Luxurious Omnidirectional Whatchamajigger, or S-L-O-W for short.Sally: S-L-O-W?The Cat: Yeah, S.L.O.W. It's better than the last thing we had: Super Hydraulic Instantaneous Transporter.Conrad: Oh, you mean...The Cat: No! Quick! To the S.L.O.W.!""The rest of the cast is equally as passionate, including the magnificent Alec Baldwin as Mr Lawrence. I like the two kids as Conrad (Spencer Breslin) and Sally (Dakota Fanning) as well, one should keep in mind their age when criticizing their acting (a fact which 'The Nostalgia Critic' on Youtube, for instance, does not take into consideration). I like the visuals and the unique style of this film, something which has never been reciprocated in quite the same manner. So why all this bad criticism? Even if this adaptation has been compared to the original story by Dr Seuss it is, i have already argued, unfair to compare the two. And those so-called critics claiming that this film is profit-oriented should take a look at my face and tell me which film isn't. I am one of the few to proudly claim that I love this film. There.Don't pay attention to all these bad reviews, at least give a chance for yourself. You may argue that I'm blinded by nostalgia from my childhood but I'm never bored with this film ,even after multiple viewings. 'The Cat in the Hat' (2003) is as entertaining as it is stylistically unique, and is certainly worth a chance.",The Cat in the Hat

I felt they were mainly an extremely creative and detailed combination.  Well, perhaps one exception on the characters, and what mainly ruined the film's potential.I think that they shouldn't have chosen Mike Myers for the main character -- he seemed to be a bit over the top and didn't exactly always stick to the character portrayed in the original Seuss story.  He seemed to be a bit like Austin Powers in a cat suit, really.I really liked the sets, particularly the town, and the cozy, somewhat 50s-ish ambiance of the house was cool, too.Overall, I think the film might be worth a matinee... or perhaps a rental.",The Cat in the Hat

I was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what S H * T spells.  Essentially what happens here is a total twisting of Dr. Seuss's classic.  It adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money. If that was a subplot, then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and ""the cat"" plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is.

Our lead children are poorly cast and their acting was robotic and bland. We also get Larry Quinn played by Alec Baldwin, yeah that fits well in Seuss' land. Baldwin's character is gross, creepy, pointless and annoying. Overall as a villain, he's very disappointing. If you removed him from the story, nothing would be altered, but the writing and main character are where this movie really falters. Mike Myers as the Cat, is as scary as watching zombies emerge from an acid vat. The makeup looks stiff, and all of his moments just make you winch. At least the makeup on Jim Carey clearly had more effort in the Grinch. In the movie itself, the Cat states he can't rhyme. This is a Dr. Suess icon, why you write that line? Aside from being out of character, the Cat makes dirty jokes that are too adult and disturbing for a movie rated PG. Why can't people remember that Suess' books were child-friendly?Anyways, the movie ends just like the book, but I suggest you refuse to even give it a look. It's guaranteed to turn any decent smile into a frown, so I give this movie two thumbs WAAAAAY DOWN! This movie is so bad you need to know that no more live action Seuss films will be done at the request of the original author's widow.",The Cat in the Hat

Sally and Conrad have a very smart house with their mum being quite posh.I would recommend this fabulous movie to all children under 12, it is funny and smart.The special effects were good (I like the talking fish) Even if you have not read the books it is still a very good movie.My rating for this movie is 9, for good acting, special effects and humour.

Alec and Mike starred in this movie and they haven't shown their faces on the big screen since. why did he have to ruin his good name? these sick people need to stop turning Dr.Seuss classics into cinema trash. i can tell Dr. Seuss himself is tossing and turning in his grave. this movie was not meant for children. haven't the writers ever thought about the children? my sister was obsessed with this movie and it drove her insane.

Oddly enough, these same media outlets simultaneously continue to advertise and promote this cinematic sickener, ""The Cat in the Hat."" I doubt any small child in my home town will ever be asked to spend the night in bed with an aging pop star; but they are all free to troop down to the local movie theater where their hearts and minds are sure to be corrupted by this horrid travesty.
Consider what those vile people in Hollywood have done here -- they've taken a kindergarten storybook and pumped it full of scatalogical humor and sexual innuendo. Hiding behind the fig leaf of a PG rating, they are peddling this smut to children under the age of seven. There was a time, not so very long ago, when a movie this vulgar could not have been released, not even for adult audiences. I never thought I'd say this (or even think it), but maybe it's time for the American film industry to restore the Production Code!",The Cat in the Hat

It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and is also a great family film. Sure,it REALLY doesn't stay true to the book. But that doesn't mean that it can't be a good movie. Mike Myers does a great job as the cat. But,I'm going to be honest when I say that the one downfall of the movie is the rest of the acting. Other than Mike myers, the rest of the actors do a horrible job in their roles. I mean, come on Alec Baldwin, you can do a better job than this. But, don't even get me started on the mom and the kids. They are the absolute worst part of this movie. Also,on a different note, there are some gross out laughs.

And if a college student can't find humor in something that was free, it's hopeless.Stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent, yet bewildering set design (that goes out of its way to market Volkswagon Beetles). I don't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie, but I have never seen anything more depressing. This was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the Grinch (which has its opponents, but I enjoyed it very much).

The acting is great overall but Dakota is just perfect in her role too.The directing is fast paced and with original, funny and clever cuts.For example, when The Cat is hit in his private parts and then comes a cut into his feelings of pain.GREAT comedy indeed. To summarize: i think that you people forgot what is to be a young kid watching this.I remember quite clearly that i loved sick and twisted humor, and that is not an adult acquired thing.I have not read Dr. Zeuss' novel and i don't have an interest in doing so.And i really think that today's kids dig more this kind of stuff than a sugary sweet moral tale.

Surprisingly this movie didn't disappoint me too much. It was in no way a great movie, but it was decent. There are a lot of bad things about this movie like how the the two kids are a real pain in the neck to there mom. Watching this as a kid myself I was amazed at how troublesome these kids were. Another bad point to this movie is the cat. Honestly Mike Myers is one of my favorite actors I just love his humor in shriek, however the cat is so annoying he is constantly doing things to get the kids in trouble, his jokes are really not funny, and he has freaky little minions that scared me as a child to clean up his mess.

232,Yvette92,Cat and Chaos,9,21 September 2009,"The Cat in the Hat has no other name--symbolic of his role as Chaos. He comes to visit two children, the predictable (as in ""orderly"") Boy and Girl at home. Inexplicably, the parents have left these two underaged children at home with no babysitter and no good sense to refuse entry to a patently dangerous beast who has regrettable taste in headgear. This is significant; despite the fact Mom And Dad represent Order in the equation, they introduce Chaos into the system by abandoning their kids. From that small oversight, the rest of the chaotic events unfold with Greek-tragedy-like inevitability, though with an unpredictable outcome. How like the universe this is; the stars in their courses, but the weather is utter madness. The Cat roams rampant through the suburban home, pretty much doing what you and I and these two kids would LOVE to do but wouldn't dare--everything Mom and Dad tell you ""not to."" In psychological terms, the Cat is fulfilling the deepest desires of the children--to be really, really BAD, but without any consequences whatsoever. It's alluring, giddy, intoxicating, and it's SCARY, too. Disorder, like a roller-coaster ride, runs frighteningly and ultimately, downhill. Just before the authoritarian ORDER figure Mom (much more symbolic of order than Dad--this IS the Fifties and you can bet she does all the housework) anyway, Mom's reappearance is imminent and the Cat uses an unlikely device to vacuum up the mess and restore all as it was--in essence reversing entropy. This is accomplished effortlessly and with no visible source of power. Here is a golden opportunity to discuss the Second Law of Thermodynamics* with your kids. A good exercise would be to try to calculate the energy that would have been required to run such a device. Question: would the device the Cat uses to clean the mess be able to run off a car battery, or would it require, oh, say, a fast breeder reactor the size of Yokohama? You do the math. This endurable children's classic is essential to teaching the young about responsibility, temptation, thermodynamics and chaos theory. You can't begin too early. ___________ *The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that ""in all energy exchanges, if no energy enters or leaves the system, the potential energy of the state will always be less than that of the initial state.""

The movie started out alright. The scenery was pretty cool and the beginning of the story was starting out not too badly. Then enters Mike Meyers as the Cat in the Hat and all quickly goes down hill and fast. YUCK!! First off, he couldn't seem to stick with an accent--many times he sounded like the lion from Wizard of Oz and then he would sound like someone from New York. I couldn't believe the horrible jokes that were being made in a movie for CHILDREN!! I know that most people argue that many of the jokes do go over the kids' heads and they have no idea what is being discussed, but I still happen to feel those types of jokes have no right to be in a movie made for CHILDREN!!!I have been a Mike Meyers fan, up until this point. I can not believe he could make this film and think in any way that it would be a good movie for CHILDREN to watch. Then I really have to question anyone that previewed this movie before its release (the studio executives and others) and allowed it to still be released. And, how could they think it would make any money???Save yourself from the horror of this movie!!! I really wish I had just believed everyone that it really is the worst movie, because sadly, I do not have a delete button for my mind--but I hope to quickly forget this horrible movie that never should have been made, much less released!!",The Cat in the Hat

Initially I didn't want to see it because it wasn't true to the book. However, we decided to give it a try, as we had a free PPV from our satellite company.  There were many funny parts:  the infomercial, the picture turns to a folder out, the amusement park ride.  Come on people, get lost in the imagination of other people.  Use your imagination.  Dr Seuss wrote excellent kid's books, but this is definitely not a kid's movie, unless the kid is under 7.  I think it was mis-marketed. It was geared to a much younger market than it should have been.  I think if it was geared towards teen agers and adults, it would've done a much better job at the theater.",The Cat in the Hat

He's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his SNL days, over ten years ago. He's doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices. His Cat is painfully unfunny. He tries way to hard. He's some weird Type A comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (Cardboard cut-outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street.) Alec Balwin tries to do a funny Great Santini impression, but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent. There's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity Paris Hilton --- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a Dr. Seuss story. Avoid this movie at all costs, folks. It's not even an interesting train wreck. (I hope they'll make Horton Hears a Who with Robin Williams.

I can't understand it, and I'm really kind of appalled. Looking at the credits now, I see that all three of the writers were from the show Seinfeld. I'd love to know who thought that was a good team to adapt a Dr. Seuss novel, because even without knowing what the results were I think I could have predicted that train-wreck.In the first 20 minutes of the movie the Cat in the Hat not only insults the two kids, and slams the little boys face into a book, but he makes fun of him by calling him a bed wetter. I'm no expert, but as far as I know, a lot of kids wet the bed, and it's really inexcusable for a movie aimed at children to make fun of that.Almost all of the jokes are inappropriate for children in a similar way, like the one about circuses torturing elephants. Some people don't approve of circuses, especially animal acts, and I'm fine with that, but a children's movie like this should be full of wonderment and delight, not cynicism, cruelty and dream-crushing.I can only assume that Myers signed on to play the cat before there was a script.

I think that the movie should have stuck directly to the book. It was unnecessary to have any sexual innuendos in the movie. It was unnecessary to show the cat's nasty behind in the film. And the scene with Alec Baldwin picking lint out of his bulging belly was very unnecessary! I know that the movie makers were trying to make this movie appealing to adults as well as children, and that's why a lot of the unnecessary stuff was placed in the movie. It would have just been better to keep the story as it was in the book and not make unnecessary changes. I am an adult, but I do not like to see this type of unnecessary crap in a movie for kids.

The acting was bad, the plot was tweaked too much, and the humor was surprisingly very crude.It starts with Conrad and Sally, A rule breaker and a future sheriff. When their Mother has to go to work, she gets Mrs. Kwan to babysit. Possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when Mrs. Kwan is watching a Taiwanese court room, a `la C-SPAN. She soon falls asleep, and here comes the Cat.The film starts to spiral out of control. The Cat came to try to let the kids have some fun. He's got Thing 1 and Thing 2, Who suddenly start trashing the house. He improvises a TV Infomercial, and accidentally slices his tail off. And when the Cat goes full Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. Possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist. And there's a fish who tries warning the kids about the Cat.Too bad he didn't warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk, or chopping your tail off.Soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog, who has the key to a crate on his collar. If the crate is not locked soon, their house will be home to the Cat's universe. Here it gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the film.The acting, overall, is horrible. Mike Meyers brings his brand of irreverent Austin Powers humor to the Cat, Saying things like ""You dirty ho"" and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata. Spencer Breslin is great as the trouble-making Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is cute as Sally, though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous Aortic Dissection waiting to kill John Ritter(accident waiting to happen). Alec Baldwin's slick and slimey Lawrence Quinn is disgusting, ever trying to woo the kids mom, who is played by Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, Mom's boss, and is also the voice of the fish. The latter three are also bland.Overall, if I were a parent I would not take my kids who are into potty humor, cause there's plenty of it and more. Save your $7.00 and see something else.

247,craigedmond97,Dr Suess' Cat?,2,26 May 2013,"The title given to the movie couldn't be further from the truth, this shambles of a movie is far from Dr Seuss' original tale of the Cat in the Hat, his most beloved character. This is carnival of garbage and attempts at destroying everything good with the original story. To use the phrase, Dr Seuss turned in his grave isn't strong enough. From the awful acting to the dreadful story and script, the viewer is left shocked and disgusted. We are introduced to Conrad and Sally, brother and sister, plank and plank. From the moment we meet them, it is like watching two talking rocks. No emotion is given to the performance at all, but who could really blame them? The dialogue is shockingly bad, and the character deter to much from the original story. Remember how in the original, they were just two bored kids? Well, this is Hollywood, so they aren't just two bored kids, one is a control freak and the other is just you average, reckless, house-destroying, little brat of a boy. To be fair, I can see where the writers are coming from because movies are ripped apart and scolded for including bland character so often these days, but maybe that's one of the reasons ""The Cat in the Hat"" just isn't meant to be made into a feature length movie.So now we have our family, I didn't mention the mother but she's there, and hosting a party for which the house must be neat and tidy or else, we are told in one of the most silly and over-acted ways, she's ""fired!"". Coincidence of coincidences, the movie begins to use some source material as it begins to rain, meaning Monk and Destructron can't play outside. Now if you're familiar with the original story, by this point you'll either have left (actually, that could be said for even those who haven't read it), cried or expect to see our titular character, the Cat in the Hat very soon. So when the children hear that ""Bump"", we know that the horrific and nightmare-inducing moment is fast approaching. We are now introduced the Cat, Mike Myers in a big cat costume, and it is absolutely the metaphor of pure terror. He looks so little like a cat and to make matters worse, that isn't the worst thing about the Cat. No, this is a Dr Seuss character who claims that he isn't good at ""rhyming"", laughs like a witch and to be honest has no idea what fun is, even though he is meant to be the advocate of it. Along with this, he isn't funny, which is what the studio was going for unfortunately. Not childish jokes either, they riddle the movie with adult humour which as I will say again, isn't Dr Seuss. The original had a child-like charm to it, that when read by grown ups didn't seem dated, instead it reminded them of their youthful days, and the message was pretty clear, ""it's fun to have fun but you've got to know how"", sickeningly enough this quote is used in the film but it just can't stick to this one message like the book did. The message is so skewed that we are unsure what it was trying to tell us, in other words, there was a message, there were hundreds of attempted messages, but none of them really touch or get to the viewer. There are so many messages crammed into the movie that it's a mess, when instead it should have kept to one. Take for example the relationship between Conrad and his mother, we are told through the obvious dialogue, but not the acting, that they don't see eye-to-eye and the mother is considering military school, an option put forward by her boyfriend Alec Baldwin, yes, boyfriend, in a Seuss movie. This idea of a family breakdown could be done well, it is an emotional and thought-provoking idea but in the wrong movie. The idea is used so lightly and done so badly, then when mixed with the million other things the movie wants to say and the crude humour, we fail to see the emotional side that should be seen. The idea of ""fun"" isn't done well either as ""fun"" is taken to new and dangerous extremes, showing that not even the cat knows how to have fun. There is so much more that is wrong with this film such as the diabolical story but when these other points are made, I think that's enough proof to stay well clear.",The Cat in the Hat

Secondly, despite being a fan of good movies, I still have a room in my heart for this movie. Mike Myers, despite him barely looking like the Cat in the book, plays a pretty solid role as the Cat, and the children are good too. The sets are very well designed, and the humour, despite relying mostly on toilet humour and adult jokes that Dr. Seuss would have never approved, I find funny for some reason.One thing I don't like though, is the Things. They look like the result of a mutation with Marge Simpson and Alfred E. Neuman. It's a good example of why you shouldn't copy how characters look in a drawing and translate them to live action without redesigning them.All in all, it's an enjoyable film, and I recommend it if you want something to laugh at.

While the set design, costumes, cinematography and cgi are stunning the fact remains that I would not feel comfortable watching this with my nieces and nephews.Allow me to list a couple of instances :-the cat's erection-the cat manhandling the children (ie. smacking the children across the room with his tail)-the cat abusing the sleeping babysitter-the cat wanting to kill the fish and the dog-the cat getting turned on by Paris Hilton(ewww)-the cat wanting to demolish the kid with the batNotice a trend? The main character was the worst part of the entire movie. Dr. Seuss would be completely ashamed and angered with this as he was with some earlier adaptations before the animated version of The Grinch. His books were sweet, innocent and delightful.

259,bustachong,"c'mon guys, it wasn't THAT bad",5,27 November 2003,"so I just came back from ye ole movie theater watching this here flick and I gotta say I was expected A LOT worse judging from the reviews I've read. I enjoyed it and laughed out loud on more than one occasion.  BUT, I see where the problems lie, and this is up for the viewer to decide.If you're looking for a Seuss flick, this really, really isn't a good example.  Sure it's very Seuss-esque visually, but aside from the very, very minor narrating, it's really not Seuss at all.  The only similarity between the book and the movie is that there's a couple kids, mom's outta town, it's raining and somehow this huge cat is running around in a silly hat.And this is where the flick is redeemed or condemned for life: all in all it's really a Mike Myers flick.  You got plenty of innuendos, offbeat humor (note: infomercial scene), plenty of morbid jokes and the classic ""Coffee Talk"" accent.  If you aren't a Myers fan to begin with, you should probably skip over this one.I also enjoyed Dakota Fanning and Sean Hayes (esp. the latter) as supporting cast, although the Alec Baldwin thing might not really fit a kids movie setting.  In all honesty, there's a couple moments that threw off the ""kids movie"" feeling, but I think by the end of the flick, that wasn't the issue. I laughed, I was visually entertained and I left feeling good that I didn't feel like I wasted my money.  I think that's what counts.  Worst comes to worst, at least rent it.  Even the opening credits is neat. C'mon guys, at least give it SOME credit.",The Cat in the Hat
260,bourdan,I want my money back.,1,23 December 2003,"Mean spirited, and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what Jim Carrey did but he should give up acting all together. He is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. I have seen a lot of bad film this year, but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worst films ever made.",The Cat in the Hat
261,aj1023,nothing like the book,3,23 March 2004,"The Cat in the Hat is one of those movies that makes you wonder: What audience was this targeted to?  The jokes are to raunchy for elementary age kids to get and the overall tackiness of the film drives everyone else mad.  Unlike the big screen adaptation of The Grinch,  there are so many parts that weren't in the book.  Did Cat originally call a garden tool a ""dirty hoe"" or make an acronym for his car called S***?  I didn't think so.  The cat is also a real jerk to the kids.  Parents with 3 year olds should not take kids to see this.  And now that I think about it, no one should see it! Recommended: No__________________2/10 stars",The Cat in the Hat
262,BananaKidOfDoom,Why I liked this movie,8,18 January 2005,"Well, there're a few reasons I enjoyed The Cat in the Hat as much as I did. Firstly, I didn't compare it to the book or the cartoon. I viewed it as its own movie, individual from the original. The Cat has to be able to fit in with the world today, he needed to be changed.Secondly, I was able to shrug off the bad (slightly dirty) jokes, even though they did detract from the experience. The ""dirty hoe"" scene should have been cut, for a brief second, it kills the Seussy feel.Thirdly, I made sure to notice anything that did feel Seussy, such as the names of a lot of the characters (Humberfloob is a name nothing non-Seuss would ever get away with) and the look of the town, and enjoyed the personalities they had to give to the characters.All in all, I think if you try to appreciate The Cat in the Hat for what it is--very loosely based on the book, not totally--you'll enjoy it an awful lot more than you'd think. The dirty and just plain dumb jokes should have gone, but they're relatively few and far between. 8/10.",The Cat in the Hat
263,winkies,"""The Cat In The Hat"" By Way Of ""Willy Wonka""",6,8 March 2005,"I absolutely HATED this film the first time I saw it on cable...but then I saw it again...and again...and again. Of course, these repeat viewings are due in part to the fact that even premium cable plays the same movie 100x times a month, but the point is, The Cat In The Hat grows on you. It's a decent, inventive comedy with some funny moments and a great cast. But is it an ideal family movie??I have a problem with films clearly targeted at children that contain sexual double-entendres. The reasoning the movie studios have for such a practice is that this way, the film will appeal to adults as well as children--so they think. When a teen comedy like Napoleon Dynamite has less sexual references/blue language than The Cat In The Hat, there is a problem. A parent shouldn't have to face a question like ""what did he mean when he talked to the garden hoe that way and kissed it?"" I found most of these blue jokes funny as an adult, but I wouldn't want my child watching them.The film this most reminded me of was Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory--Mike Myers plays the sardonic, somewhat dangerous (though ultimately soft- hearted) Wonka-like Cat, who turns the stuffy lives of Sally and Conrad upside down. Dakota Fanning & Spenser Breslin as the kids are wonderful--the children act mostly like adults (in contrast to the childlike Cat), and these two actors do a great job. There is not one moment during the film that I am not painfully aware of the fact that the Cat is Mike Myers in a furry costume doing shtick. Myers never stops being Myers. Sometimes his jokes work (the ""I'm Easy"" musical interlude after he gets his 'nads smashed in), sometimes they don't (the cooking show segment was really unfunny). His facial makeup is a little less grotesque than Jim Carrey's in The Grinch, but it's still kinda ugly & disturbing. Alec Baldwin makes a fine villain--but I can't help feeling that a role that highlights his paunch and general run-down appearance since his days as the hottie that starred in films like The Shadow is ultimately a bad career move. And Sean Hayes IS Tony Randall (him and David Hyde-Pierce should duke it out).Makes a decent rental if you haven't seen it, and a bizarrely addictive viewing experience on cable for this reviewer. But I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 11 unless you're one o' them hipster parents.",The Cat in the Hat

268,Burchardus,"A fair fantasy tale, a bit predictable tough",7,16 January 2006,"Well, let me stress out in the beginning: I don't know anything about (thus also any book by) Dr. Seuss - except that he was this hotshot writer whom every American seem to love (I remember best the bit Joey did in the first season finale on ""Friends"").As for the movie I found it good enough to earn its points: Mike Myers is funny, though Americans may find him sometimes risqué for a movie aimed at kids. Overall it was a good mix between a typical children's' message film (though the message is not quite clear) and no-non-sense fun. The FX were more than adequate (well, Rhythm & Hues were mentioned in a book about animation by Julius Wiedemann, that's how I discovered the film - my girlfriend liked the fish), the design was sufficiently artificial to make it work, and finally, for a simple tale like this it was short enough (I guess much longer and I'd have had to downrate the picture).As a compensation for the predictable story, the Cat was quite unpredictable in the course of events (as I indicated above I can not relate to the book, so I'm writing for one who has never heard/read/seen the story before), so it never suffered from the downsides of the movie. As for the kids, they were surprisingly un-annoying, as quite often children in movies make you squirm. Spencer Breslin proved again (after Disney's The Kid with Bruce Willis) that he can play a character that I would find annoying without being annoying, and Dakota Fanning (I haven't seen her before in any movie, I think) is a girl to watch out for.So overall, here's a family movie that can please many with (in my free-spirited mind) a slight edge that you know was meant for people to clap their hands over their mouths but actually is quite tame. If you don't mind to actually see the workings of a commercial approach to a story in a movie, you can be entertained for those 82 minutes. (And if you like the technical side of movie making, as I, you can see some mildly interesting features in the motion picture. That's how he earned the little bonus. These days Hollywood often makes super-duper movies that make B-movies appear as technical masterstrokes; witness the awful effects on ""Van Helsing"" or the mostly unconvincing SFX on ""LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring""!)",The Cat in the Hat

When we picked him up, he was SCREAMING and crying in an absolute panic, saying over and over how scary it is. He tried to throw the movie away and now, six hours later, is clinging to my wife most pathetically. This is not his nature. I haven't even seen the movie, though I'm dying to know what spooked him so. I can say this though - think twice before letting a child to whom you read The Cat in the Hat see this movie.",The Cat in the Hat
274,way too wired,Wasn't as bad as I thought,5,12 April 2004,"*might be a few spoilers*I went into this movie with low hopes, but came out pleasantly surprised. Even though there are many embarrassing ""jokes"" the film redeemed itself by keeping with Seuss's excellent political comments and morals. Anyone who knows anything about Seuss's work should know that all of his books/poems had an underlying meaning - they were all a sort of parable.
The Cat in the Hat is really all about Communism and Capitalism (represented very well by Sally in the film). The Cat is acting as the Anarchist to show the children that there is more to life than what they're living: ""it's fun to have fun but you have to know how"" - but is also warning them that anarchic fun can get them into a lot of trouble and lose them respect, but being too uptight can lose them friends. The fish represents dictatorship by trying to control and repress the children and the Cat but of course the Cat overthrows him, quite literally.The mother in the book is rather a passive figure, she leaves her children alone at home while she tries to earn a living, in fact if you look far enough into it there could be reason to believe that she is a prostitute because she runs out mysteriously leaving her two very young children alone. There is also a very stark absence of a father - there is no mention of one at all. I think in this respect the film did what it could with this strain of the storyline. We see the mother out earning a living because she is left alone with two kids to raise and actually taking the trouble to find a babysitter, even if she does sleep through the whole thing. There would have been global outrage if the filmmakers had stuck strictly to the original story in this case.I was glad to see the part about the pink spot in the film, for two reasons. First it cuts down the likelyhood of a sequel and second it referenced The Cat in the Hat Strikes Back. In the film the spots are more of a bright purple colour but the effect is still the same. This book showed the children alone once more, yet being subjected to almost child labour - they have to clear their front driveway of vast amounts of snow before their mother returns from her mysterious afternoon outings. However the Cat turns up again and creates havoc that will have to be cleared up - the relentless pink spot that bounces from one thing (including the mother's dress and something in the father's separate bedroom) to the next until it covers the whole of the white snow outside. With this simple plot device for teaching young kids the alphabet, Seuss was actually commenting on the 1950s social 'problem' of increasing homosexuality 'spreading' everywhere and how it was being shunned and repressed so ignorantly.I was also pleased with the amount of sexual promiscuity in the film (like the Cat's interest in Joan) as again it keeps in with Seuss's work. All in all I think this film did well to capture the Seussian world, particularly with the impressive opening credits and the iconic shot of Sally and Conrad staring gloomily out of the front window. But I did only give the film half marks because the script should have been more sophisticated than just resorting to cringe-worthy gags and a manic Mike Myers yelling ""oh yeah"" Austin Powers style through the whole film, but visually this movie was a treat.",The Cat in the Hat

I took my 11-year-old nephew along with me, and he is usually the kindest movie critic on the planet. Well, he didn't much care for it either. I fell asleep about 45 minutes into the film, and realized upon awakening about 15 minutes later that I hadn't missed a thing. I won't begin to discuss this piece of drivel in criticspeak.

279,lpratt6,Worst movie I ever saw as a kid.,1,31 December 2012,"I'm writing this as a warning to parents who might think this movie will please their children. I went to see this movie when I was nine years old because I thought it might be fun to see. I loved Dr. Seuss, and ""The Cat in the Cat"" was one of my favorite books, so I figured it would be cool to see the book made into a movie. Yikes, if I only knew what kind of horror I was in for. I could see right through the movie, even then, when I was still interested in the Pokemon series and watched The Lion King 2 on a regular basis. I could tell that none of the jokes in The Cat in the Hat worked, and I thought everything in the movie was just really stupid. I kept waiting with a small hope that there would be a really good surprise at the end, but the stupidity just kept piling up. Nothing in this movie has the whimsical charm of Dr. Seuss; they just drain the creativity out and give all things Seussical the finger. Kids are not that dumb; if they know anything about the book, they're going to notice that something is wrong with this movie. I can't believe that Mike Myers let himself get into this mess, and I also can't believe I was fooled into thinking that I would enjoy this movie. My mom isn't that into kids' movies, but she was able to stay awake for most of my other theater trips...she was out like a rock by the halfway point for Cat in the Hat. So take that as a warning: neither kids nor adults will enjoy this movie. Toddlers with no knowledge of the book might, but I would strongly recommend the book as a much better alternative for them.",The Cat in the Hat

I look back and watch it again now, and the jokes are so bad, and the storyline is just like any other boring kids program, but that's part of what makes it such a fun and exciting film to watch. Some of the one- liner jokes are so bad, that they are funny. They actually make me laugh. As I'm coming to the end of my teenage years, I'm not a baby, but I'm still young. I'm still a child inside, and I still have an imagination that needs feeding. This is the kind of film that leaves me dreaming. I wish I had a better childhood and that something amazing happened, like a talking cat would come out of nowhere and allow me to have fun. I still wish that something like that would happen now. It would be so amazing to go on an adventure like that in my own house. Also the jokes, the acting, and pretty much the entire film is so cheesy and bad. It's something that I love to watch, and it's great if you don't want to hurt your brain by concentrating too hard. Another thing is, the graphics and special effects are pretty good!

Being a person that read Dr. Suess for hours on end as a 5 and 6 year old, I am embarrassed for the makers of the movie, for the characters are extremely exaggerated and undeveloped. Just for the record, I never did want to see this movie in the first place, but my mother, for some reason or other, bought it. I curse that day even now.Moving on, The Cat was so OOC that it was hard to watch more than the first 20 minutes.

I do not recall any ""rule-adoring"" Sally any more than I recall any ""rule-breaking"" Conrad (playing the part of ""I"", I'm assuming) in the book. And when it comes down to Dakota Fanning, I think she's an amazing actress that somehow or other landed in the middle of a real 'cat'-astrophe.My two favorite characters from the story (Thing 1 and 2) were absolutely appalling.

289,nevadacityfilmfan,This movie is bad so very bad that it is sad,1,21 November 2003,"I have seen some terrible movies (Battlefield Earth, Congo, Batman and Robin) and I have never walked out of a movie before it was over.  There was always the hope that something would get better, and there was always something entertaining to watch.  This movie was different that any other terrible movie that I have seen.  I actually walked out of the Cat in the Hat.  I stayed until just after `Thing One' and `Thing Two' started jumping around and joining the fun (and I use the word loosely).  I am not sure how I managed to stay for the first 30 or so minutes but what I saw made me want to run to the nearest showing of ""Glitter.""  I was lucky enough to get a refund after leaving a quarter way through the movie but I cannot imagine the movie getting any better for the simple reason that there was no plot, not at all.  The Cat in the Hat is a great children's book, and so are all the other Dr Seuss books.  That does not mean they should all become feature films.  After ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" I was eagerly awaiting this film.  I thought it might be good.  Unlike the ""Grinch"" the writers of this movie were unable to expand upon Dr. Suess' story.  The movie seemed like an excuse for Mike Myers to have a lot of improv, who I have to agree with the critics seemed to be doing his best Austin Powers in a cat suit impression. Overall, I think the downfall of the ""Cat in the Hat"" was the fact that there was no story to base a plot on.  No amount of star power could save this story, not even Kelly Preston, not even Alec Baldwin, not even Dakota Fanning.  A dismal disappointment that I advise you to miss. I would rather count one fish, two fish until I was blue fish, and eat green eggs and ham than see the remaining antics of the ""Cat in the Hat.""  Do yourself a favor and read Dr. Seuss' story instead of seeing this film.  You will have more fun.",The Cat in the Hat
290,Jahhim,Mr Myers how could you?,1,22 November 2003,"Well I guess I know the answer to that question. For the MONEY! We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a chance. Well I should have went with my instincts. It was a complete piece Hollywood trash. Once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good. Aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with a moth eaten script. It's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor, and awful pastel sceneries. It jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction. This is then compounded with, ............................yes I'll say it, BAD ACTING! I couldn't help but feel like I was watching ""Coffee Talk"" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was the Cat intended to be a middle aged Jewish woman?  Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were no prize either, but Mr. Myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another Austin Powers movie.   F-, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save your money!",The Cat in the Hat
291,smiley-43,Too bad people don't like it.,8,26 December 2006,I don't know why people had problems with this film. sure it doesn't follow the book (how could you turn a Dr. Seuss book into a 90 minute film without taking liberties is beyond me).I agree that this isn't really a film for kids but for adults who have a wacky sense of humour. I really liked it and spent my time laughing heaps. Needs a certain brand of humour (not bad humour mind you- I don't watch anything dumped on telly :-)). The jokes will probably go over kids heads. Considering how wacky the books were I think that this does quite well. I haven't seen 'The Grinch' that's true but if that was considered to be fabulous then no doubt that would also have the outrageous element of the books in it.Mike Myers did a great job as did the two kids and Alec Baldwin. Kelly Preston was as usual which was great. The little boy (forget his name though I just saw his appearance on Leno is a great actor and will definitely go far if he doesn't go off track into 'I used to be a child actor now I'm a brat as an adult' as many are prone too.,The Cat in the Hat
292,aignatiou,THE WORST MOVIE THIS YEAR,1,23 November 2003,This was a poor excuse for a kids movie. Gigli was better than this. This was the most incoherent piece of garbage. I was appauled that Universal left there names on it. Brian Grazer is an awesome producer but he fell really low on this. I thought he had more sense than to keep his name on this piece of C*ap. Mike Myers wasn't even funny. Nobody can save this movie. Anybody who had any say in this movie deserves to be fired. If you are a parent DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS! It's UNBELIEVABLY CRUDE AND HAS WAY TO MUCH INUENDO FOR KIDS UNDER 10. Not what you want your four year old to see. Unbelievably crude excuse for a kids movie. This should be boycotted at all costs.,The Cat in the Hat

I personally, along with my children, thought it was very funny and great family entertainment. Mike Myers was fantastic, and as usual, really funny and well suited to the character. I really think a people have lost their way these days and try to look for all the bad things about entertainment rather than simply enjoying a movie for what it is. This was hardly badly written, directed or acted by anyone taking part in the film. Some of the movies I have seen recently are terrible. With no direction, badly filmed and terribly edited so it seems like the film was just thrown together with a lot of ideas that don't really fit... This isn't like that, it's great family entertainment. I don't know what the people that wrote all the bad comments about this film were expecting??? All I can suggest is GROW UP!!

There are lots of laughs in it,and sometimes the most cheesy films are the funniest.Like this one. All my friends like this movie,my brother likes the bit where the Cat does the cooking show,along with myself. What is bad about this movie?Its a family comedy,that children think is funny.The cat done by Mike Myers was quite entertaining,and Sally and Conrad were quite funny.The bit where cat gets hit with the pinnate is a laugh.Movies aren't always aimed at ADULTS.Children like different kinds of movies,and children find different things funny to what adults find funny.Luv Alix",The Cat in the Hat

Not only is it not as bad as everyone is saying, but it's actually rather enjoyable. I was with a 3 year old who loved it, and I myself found it very amusing.It's very obvious what's happening is that critics (who let's face it, know no more than any other moviegoer of average intelligence) are all just agreeing with one another, and everyone else is just jumping on the bandwagon trying to look more intelligent by saying it stinks.If you were planning on taking your kids to see it or just go out of curiosity, go.

It probably helped that I expected this to be utterly awful and was tempted to leave the car running to make a quick getaway from the theatre.  Granted, it is not a classic, but the kids (a 5 year old, a 4 year old and a 33 year old) enjoyed it immensely.Myers plays the role a tad too close to his Austin Powers/Dr Evil characters, but I'll forgive him since he is a brilliant comic actor.  The rest of the cast are good, if not exceptional, aside from Alec Baldwin who is excellent in his part as the annoying prospective husband.All in all, not the disaster it could have been.  I can see why US voters who were brought up to revere Dr Seuss, may have a real issue with Myers' portrayal, but if you take the films as a piece of light entertainment for kids I don't think you will be too disappointed.6/10",The Cat in the Hat

His voice/accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound, which is about the only laughing I heard at the theater.

The only problem was that I attended an advanced screening in Chicago and got in free.  Unfortunately, they'd have to pay me to laugh through this poor excuse for a dismal Mike Myers vehicle to nowhere. Are Hollywood writers, production designers and producers so far removed from reality that they can't figure out what's good and bad taste, especially when adapting from beloved children's books?

I have read some criticisms on this board and others and came away with the general idea that I would hate this. The fact is that I really liked this film and maybe the people criticizing should stop holding off on their indie-film reviews for a film that was going to be an overt massive marketing commodity from the start. To read some of these diatribes you would think that people wanted the exact storyline from the book or something close to it. Well, then it would have been a 15 minute movie. This movie IS what it IS...a campy and silly film geared towards young kids with large disposable incomes and not arrested developmental adults that wish they were young kids with large disposable incomes. Sure...Myers sounded a little too much like the Lion in Wizard of Oz sometimes and yes the screenplay was not on par with On the Waterfront, but my kid laughed and left the theater wanting to see it again.

Dakota Flemming is the only upside, she is such an amazing little actress. But, the movie was so bad that I can't describe it in words. It is just like throwing a million stupid things and trying to make them funny. The Grinch was a great film adaptation of the book, the Cat, however, is not. Please do not see this movie. It is worse than Gigli or From Justin to Kelly. It makes you wonder how struggling filmmakers do not make it, but a piece of crap like this is accepted and makes millions and millions.

That Lame, stupid, easily refutable ""argument"" won't work here. It's a kids movie that's filled with seedy, inappropriate, garbage that needn't be put in a movie that's guaranteed to attract children. People also say that ""Kids won't get the jokes"". I Say ""Why put them in to begin with""? They only serve to degrade one of the Most Cherised Pieces of Children's Literature of the 20th century, and It's author, Dr Seuss. (one of the Best in his field and always demanding perfection for his books) into a generic Writer and Illustrator.The Movie itself, is terrible. The Cat abandons rhyming in the first 5 minutes of his first appearance. The Cat himself, instead of being the Anarchic, but sweet, Merrymaker he was in the 1957 book, is now a Vulgar, jaded perversion of the original. Profanities are partially censored to dupe the Easily duped MPAA (Was the Hayes Office this gullible?). The Subplot injected into this movie (Involving the Kids' Ditzy Single Mom and a smarmy boyfriend) is entirely irrevelent and does nothing to enhance the book (Unlike the Moss-Covered-Three--Handled-Family Gredunza in the Cat in the Hat TV Special). The Song are Generic and plain not catchy. and Disgusting Bathroom Jokes are all Over the Place.If the Cat in the Hat book was slightly Longer, Would Dr. Seuss Put Such nasty and obscene jokes in his book? NO! IF the TV Special was longer than 30 Minutes, Would Dr. Seuss Allow Chuck Jones, Hawley Pratt and Friz Freleng (Writer, Director, and Producer, respectivly) to include such horrible jokes? NO!

Universal studios of course! And they straight up butchered our childhood's. It is disgustingly revolting. The sheer thought of THIS as an adaptation of a KIDS book that we all read and grew up with, just makes me sick to my stomach. Also, I would like to go punch the MPAA in the face for not making this a PG-13 film of an adaption of a kids book for crying out loud. Let me give you a few reasons why this movie is my least favorite movie of all time. 10. This should have been an animated movie. I would have liked it a heck more if this was animated. At least then I could give it some credibility. 9. What gave them the idea to make this an actual movie. Look, I don't care if Hollywood adapts more books into movies as long as they represent the source material. 8. IT does not represent the source material and doesn't understand why the material was great to begin with. 7. The casting of Mike Myers as the cat. I love Mike Myers but he just doesn't seem like the type to play this sort of character. I would have preferred Robert Downey, Jr. 6. The pop cultural references which I hate with a passion. 5. The acting. Breslin and Dakota are just so bland and boring. Steven Hawking's voice- box emotes more emotion than these two do. 4. The director, Bo Welsh, is a production designer and better than a director I must say. 3. Rated PG?! That is the dumbest decision the MPAA has made since giving Roger Rabbit the same rating, which totally deserved the same rating. Seriously, the boy almost said the s-word!!!! 2.

I watched this film many times when I was a kid and it never really meant much to me. It was colorful, sure, but it was never a memorable experience. Also the gaint cat apparently has traumatized one of my friends. He hates how he just apears next to the kids when they're hiding under the bed.
However, I just watched it on my 19th birthday while getting buzzed on cheap wine and Cheetos and... it works. It's fun as hell. I don't know how proud Mike Myers is about this one, but he carries the film to the end. It's enjoyable albeit mostly ironically.
But I must add that it's not great - acting is quite bad, effects haven't aged well, some weird cuts here and there and fans of Dr. Seuss will most likely be disappointed. Should you let your kids watch it? Probably no. There are more valuable films for them. Instead watch it yourself. Maybe you'll have a blast.At the end of the day, it's a silly film, the sets looked nice, everything was absurd and Alec Baldwin takes out his dentures, gets his TV repossessed and turns purple just to become an Academy award nominee the next year. 7/10 appreciating it's existence.",The Cat in the Hat

There's quite a few lines that I use pretty much on a daily basis. It's colorful, whimsical, charming and funny. Of coarse it's not Oscar worthy.

I think it's good with a few flaws (Some of the acting, the jokes, and bits of the story are a bit messy) The set design looks amazing and looks like it actually came from a Dr. Suess book especially the Cat's dimension.Pretty good film for the family.

328,JonWithTheWind,Worst Movie Ever,2,21 November 2003,"I just got home from seeing Cat in the Hat, and it was a very painful experience. None of the movie made any sense what so ever. First of all, the plot was terrible, but even that is understandable. But most importantly, the Cat (played terribly by Mike Myers), is a mix of weird Mike Myers characters from SNL etc. This may sound like a good thing, but trust me it is not. Every joke is based on potty humor that doesn't even seem appealing to a 3rd grader. The Cat is always plotting on killing everything. The only good thing about this movie is that the actual sets looked very much like a Dr. Seuss book, and similar to Edward Scissorhands. If you are a fan of Dr. Seuss do not see this movie, you will think, ""Why did they butcher this perfectly good book?"" And if you hate Dr. Seuss still don't see this movie because there is no humor in it whatsoever. Overall, unless you really want to stare at nice sets for an hour and a half, go rent a decent movie and save yourself some time, money, and a painful movie based very roughly on the book by Dr. Seuss.1/5 stars",The Cat in the Hat

I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seen--and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is okay (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that he is REALLY annoying). The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience. The plot drags on and on, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. The ""witty"" parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (I remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to, well, a type of person people call a ""ho""). Even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last FOREVER. Do not waste your time. I know small kids who hated this movie. If children can't stand it, I do not know how any adults can. I would like to fume more about this film but I do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it. I HATED IT!

I didn't go expecting anything wonderful, but I wasn't going for me, I was going for my kids.  They love the cat-in-the-hat book, and we've read it more times than I can count. All of those books are very popular around this house. I also personally enjoy at least some of Mike Myer's work.  ""So I married an Axe Murderer"" is one of my all time favorite movies.  However, considering that it was a kids movie, a lot of that movie was out of line.  In a movie like Shrek you have a little more wiggle room with where you draw the line of appropriate.  The story is unique, and people expect that they aren't going to be sure of what's in it.  With Cat in the Hat there are certain expectations of decorum that I didn't feel were met.  There was a bit too much ""austin powers"" in Cat in the hat for my taste.Worse, the movie in general was very over the top.  They tried way too hard. Whole sections of the movie seemed to not flow very well.  The innuendo was unnecessary (though at least less blatant than grinch).
Do yourself a favor and take your kids to see Elf this season instead. I'm so glad we had free tickets and only wound up paying 4$ to go.  Even at 4$ it seemed like a ripoff to me.  I hope this review saves some of you from wasting an hour or so of your life.",The Cat in the Hat

I guess, children from 8 to 15 will like it, as it will be understandable for them... i thought it was another good film of Mike Myers, and even Dakota Fanning. This movie is all about humor, and it's a fun film for anyone with some life-loving spirit in them! Others who may not agree with me, could find it rude - but we all go through the stage of crudeness! - well, mostly born late 20th century to early 21st century......

The preformce given by Mike Myers is revolutionary and is deserving of a Oscar, his laugh is a persistent little tap on my shoulder of existential happiness.
(But he said hoe so I bumped it down to ten out of eleven)
And the spectacular cgi is moving to the point were I can't tell if my family is actually really real and if my parents and cat are cgi fish in skin tight suits.However the only big downside is that the movie lacks a large amount of big strong tough cocaine smuggling French men.Hopefully this review helps you decide to experience this moving masterpiece.

If they were trying to make it appealing to both kids and adults, their efforts served to just create a movie that was unenjoyable for both groups.There were quite a few scenes that were completely inappropriate for kids, especially one in which the Cat's ""bare bottom"" is shown several times. My kids said they didn't enjoy the film much because the Cat was too continually and overly silly.  For the same reason, I found myself painfully enduring the movie while wishing that it would hurry up and conclude. The only redeeming factor of the film was the two child actors.  They did an incredible job, despite all the annoyances they must have had to deal with. If it weren't for the outstanding acting of the two children, I would have given this movie a rating of only 1 instead of 2.If you want to see a Cat in the Hat that has both enjoyable music and humor, stick with the animated version.",The Cat in the Hat

Her favorite part was when the kids told the cat to leave. The only part I liked was the opening credits when they did the little dream works logo sequence in a dr suess way.If taken as a kids movie it was hard for the kids to follow and the humor was inappropriate.

Kelly Preston and Alec Baldwin were beyond flat and Myers was a caricature of himself (and not even the funny parts).Humor was absent. There was audible audience laughter TWICE in our full, first-weekend auditorium.None of the charm, none of the whimsy, none of the wonder of Dr. Seuss. Sexual references followed by obvious, nearly-spoken vulgarities, and ""humor"" based on adult references that children won't even understand.Totally pointless changes to the original book. Mom wasn't on a shopping trip as in the book. She was a single, working, disconnected mother with unreliable baby-sitters and an unnecessary jerk of a boyfriend as a lifeless villain. The baby-sitter, by the way, was portrayed in an offensive, stereotypical, racially insensitive manner.One of the worst kids' movies I've ever seen. Worst adaptation of a wonderful book.

All critics know how to do is complain about modern action in movies such as this one b/c their OLD! I would recommend people stop listening to critics and press reviewers and go see the movie to form your own opinion! In some ways it did look like it was aiming towards audiences of all ages. I admit Alec Baldwin was too disgusting in this. Anyway I give this movie a 8.5 out of 10. I rate it so high b/c of the effort that was put into it on the special effects and the scenery.

But what do you expect from a kids film. I agree that this film won't appeal to a lot of adults but that is no reason to bring the film down. Mike meyers did a good job in my opinion and Alec Baldwin was my favourite in the whole movie.Don't listen to anyone that says this film isn't suitable for kids. It has one joke of Adult humour that will just pass over the kids heads. Just one bit of Adult humour. ONE. I couldn't understand it. What was all the fuss about. The rest of the film was filled with crude humour but nothing that isn't natural in a kids film these days.This film isn't great but it isn't razzie worthy. But i'll say it was oscar worthy.

I went to see it with much trepidation and was expecting a foul-mouthed feline dropping sexual innuendo like dander, but was surprised to find a movie with great special effects, decent b-grade acting, except Myers whose stilted Linda Richman act became tiresome after his first scene, and  an amazing set.  The best character was the animated fish, which was very well voiced by Shawn Hayes, also Mr. Humberfloob.  Kelly Preston and Alec Baldwin were good as well.  Dakota Fanning was perfectly cast as the goody-two-shoes daughter and Spencer Breslin did a very good job as the out-of-control son.

The problem is that story is so simplistic and short...there's not enough there to MAKE a good movie.To that effect, director Bo Welch created a few new characters for the film, including Alec Baldwin as the nefarious Quinn, who wants to send young Spencer Breslin to military school, and the germ-enfatuated real estate boss Mr. Humberfloob, played by Sean Hayes, who alsos voices the goldfish.Myers struggles to make the cat a lovable character, but unfortunately the material to work with just isn't there. Not to mention that Myers constantly slips into his previous roles...to the point where you see Linda Richman in a ridiculous getup. The makeup is once again a huge problem for Myers, much as it was for Jim Carrey in The Grinch.Baldwin is once again wasted in this film, but then again so is everything else.

Don't get me wrong, it isn't good, but it isn't all-time level horrible.
The main problem with the Cat is the fact that the script writers forgot that Dr. Seuss works are supposed to be clever and harmless works for the whole family, family-oriented word-play and rhyming are important, no... mandatory in any rendition of a family classic like the Cat in the Hat. Unfortunately, the script writers felt compelled to ditch most of the rhyming and instead work in jokes about butt cracks, farting, belching, and hats as erections. Myers was ocassionally funny as the Cat, but his snarky, knowing attitude certainly missed the point of the Cat as originally written.Personally, the one time I actually chuckled out loud was when the baby-sitter commented on the Taiwanese Parliament CSPAN that she was making the children watch... and I ask you, ""has Seuss ever written about the Taiwanese Parliament""?Movie Snob shakes his head and gives this film a 3.",The Cat in the Hat

The saddest part is, that was is funny is generally when ""The Cat"" is off the camera. I found Baldwin to be the most amusing role in the entire movie and that's simply not the way it should be. Is this a children's movie? Is it a comedy? Is it an adaptation of a book? What is it? Some of the jokes were so crude it made me uncomfortable to be in the theatre. Not because I can't handle crude humor but because this movie was aimed at little kids and was an adaptation of a kids' book! Bathroom humor, sexual innuendos, swearing (although indirectly) and the... the ""dirty hoe"" joke was just not okay. Not in anything associated with Dr. Seuss. Seriously, I wouldn't take small children to see this movie. I couldn't handle, ""Daddy, what's 'dirty hoe' mean?""Bottom line, the movie can't figure out what it is. I enjoy children's movies when they remain children's movies. However, I was so dreadfully uncomfortable the whole time because of the humor that I couldn't get into ""children's story"" mode.

Regrettably, what severely hurt this movie was the writers and producers obviously didn't do much homework on the books, and rather focused on the animated special, then went and threw in some ""adult humour,"" as a flimsy excuse for the older market to come and see a film that was originally aimed at children.Although I do admire Mike Myers' comedy in his other films, apparently nobody informed him that he supposed to be playing the Cat in the Hat, and not a feline version of Austin Powers (except with a Jewish-Brooklyn accent), and technically, the humour could've been omitted and kept the movie fresh.  I'm not saying it should've been (heaven forbid) ""Disney-fied,"" but I feel that lately Universal's forgotten when one handles children-based material, it's best you leave it on a ""family-friendly"" level.  Despite what my imdb vote claims, I meant to rate this a five, but due to a malfunctioning mouse I ended up clicking it on a seven.

364,kerrbear67,Finally a kids movie,6,18 April 2004,"I just recently sat in the theatre with about 50 pre school age kids to see this movie. Usually anytime you are in a cinema with any amount of kids under the age of 5 they usually talk or whinge through out the whole movie. This was a movie that the adults laughed at the tongue in cheek and the children were mesmerised with the movie, the bright colours the simple language the easy story line, so good on universal pictures for the new classic Children's movie. It contained morals and values that the wee children need to learn whether by a brightly animated movie or by the parents. Mike Myers did a wonderful job as the cat.",The Cat in the Hat
365,georgekirby70,"Not Something I'd pull out the hat, but had some funny moments",5,31 December 2011,"This film is the live action version of Dr Seuss's classic story, Cat In the Hat.I'd just like to point out the good things in this movie. There weren't very many, just funny jokes.The funniest bit in my opinion was when he was talking about a car called "" Super Hydrolic Instintanious Transporter"" (S.H.I.T) The bit where he says "" Dirty Hoe"" cracked me up as well.But this film had a lot more bad things than good things. The number 1 worst thing was crappy special effects. They couldn't even make the houses or the background look real. And today, even the most crappiest films can do that! The costumes (apart from the cat's costume) were terrible. The script was an abomination! The acting was OK, a lot of the characters however (including the cat) were very irritating! At the start,for some reason, Conrad was being crazy by covering himself with bread and food and then sliding down the stairs like a maniac! I was like ""WTF""! Larwance ""Larry"" was the worst character! He kept sneaking into the mom's house and stealing beer! Seriously,can he just buy some from the shop like a normal person?!The babysitter was kinda funny,kinda annoying. And the cat, he was just insane! Well I guess he's supposed to be! :DI don't recommend this film, but I recommend watching it for the funny parts!",The Cat in the Hat

The sets are good but with out a script that gives the original book some respect, the whole movie is put into a tailspin with out the direction and the innocent that made the book such a classic. The actors involved look like they are embarrass to be in this mess, and the child actors look like they were drugged during the making of this movie.  I don't know what when through the minds of the makers of this film but I hope there is some kind of justice for all of the people who paid to see it.

Even my wife and I chuckled along. It was a thoroughly pleasant experience all round.No it isn't that true to the book - but you know, films typically have to last longer than 10 minutes otherwise people feel they have been ripped off! LOLYes there are some more ""adult"" moments, but they are done in a way that leaves them way over young childrens heads. I always work on the basis that if kids don't get it, great. If they do get the adult humour, it's rather too late to be worried about it.Mike Myers was Mike Myers, but it was a pretty good day at the office for him in our opinion.I wouldn't go see this without kids - it's not aimed at you.

But did anyone think that a ten minute book could be duplicated perfectly into an hour and a half movie? Seuss purists should probably avoid this altogether. It's not much like the book. Get over it.I'm obviously in the minority, but I didn't think it was that bad. Mike Myers was funny, the kids were good, the sets were wacky, and the supporting cast was goofy as intended. It's a commercial piece. I got tired of seeing the cat in the hat advertising everything from chips to electronics too, but what are you going to do? Try not to take it so seriously and maybe you'll find that you kind of like it too.",The Cat in the Hat

Millions of kids love it because it has child humour and a simple story line. Dr suess didn't write this book for adults and Bo Welch didn't direct or make it for adults. So next time you watch a kid film get your kid to write the review. And also if you are and adult voting watch the film again through kids eyes. 8/10 a very good film that many kids should love it. Fine I don't want adults to burst out with laughter with film just let your kids watch and enjoy it. You never know the second time you watch it you might really enjoy it! By,The Cat in the Hat
371,paul-toner,82mins that I'll never get back!,1,4 April 2004,"In spite of 'The Grinch' which scared the pants off them, much against our better judgement we took the kids; or rather, they took us because they already love 'The Cat in the Hat'. Yes it amused them (7, 5, and twins at 2.5yrs) but it was forgotten within minutes of leaving the theatre, thank god! What will endure, will be the book itself and the memory of being read to as a child and the joy of then being able to read it themselves.And why is anybody surprised that it was such an awful film?. Hello?!!.. They HAD to flesh it out. There's no substance in the book! It's a whimsy, a delight, a wonder piece of 20th century doggerel.... but the makings of a film score?... Pulease!!!??? It's just that the flesh they provided was of such an lewd nature. I'd expected to be disappointed, but anticipation FAR exceeded the event.As for the pc posturing. It's not OK to have them 'home alone', but it's OK for rhymes that finish with, but don't actually say, `balls', buttock cleavage,unvoiced acronyms that spell `S***' and to top it all the juvenile `dirty hoe' gag? Talk about double standards!Surprised at the fact that the take on the movie was so high, yet the scoring so low? Gimme a break!! Most people feel obliged to view the movie adaptation of a book they've already read, but here, a piece of our collective childhood has been hijacked and transformed into a cash cow and a vehicle for the ego of Mr. Myers.This piece of cynical merchandising and it's ilk will go the same route as the 70's 'Disaster Movie'; an embarrassment to all concerned except the financiers and a sad footnote to the declining careers of once bankable actors.Theodor Seuss Geisel won't just be turning in his grave...

He is making a ton of money, yet he is no longer with us.  Keep making movies of the Suess classics, they are great! The one thing that we could go without is the few almost bad words that come out of Cat's mouth, but remember, I said almost bad words, as they are never completed.

373,traantz,Unexpected,10,22 November 2004,"After having seen The Grinch, I expected the same type of horrid direction and nonstop sickness associated with very few films to such a large degreeBut I wasn't expecting thisThe direction (first time director Bo Welch, formerly a production designer... hopefully he won't stay there) handles the material as best he can, and gives the world a strange thickness through the surreal surroundings it tries so hard to emulate (and captures in it's own way, to a rather effective degree) without relying too hard upon the source material (which doesn't give anywhere nearly as much space for add-ons that The Grinch took to heart in it's adaptation) and attempting it's own visual feel and flowIt keeps certain classical Suessian visuals such as various plants, trees, clouds, etc, and constructs them in a believable manner... it all ends up creating a surprisingly rich visual palette that is truly a marvel to look atAs far as the film in itself is concerned, it has it's ups and downs. Many complain about the characters, however the only aspects of the entire film that ever bugged me (and believe me... almost everything in films bug me) would have to be the Things (dear God why wont they stop talking and moving?!?!?!) and Mrs. Kwan, who effectively angers me even when pretending to be asleepMike Meyers pulls out his classic moves from his SNL days, and throws in some of the strange expressions and mannerisms that have become like a second skin to him since The Spy Who Shagged Me. Although, I must admit, he manages to pull it off, for once. He managed to get quite a few laughs out of me, and I'm not ashamed to admit it, I didn't hate enjoying those partsAlec Baldwin adds a rather unneeded amount of nastiness to the film, although in the end it works well to establish him as the baddie for the film's young ""heroes"" to attempt to stop. There are many moments when a single line can make you laugh, and actually make up for a rather unimaginative or fruitless scene, in some bizarre wayThe children are well casted (and the beautiful Dakota Fanning manages to pull off a seemingly 2-dimensional character and make her seem somewhat human... although that may just be me) and play off well against Mike Meyer's often forced jokesThe oft complained about fish is actually quite well animated (smooth animations, and a particularly gorgeous sheen off of the skin give a weighted and textured feel to an otherwise very unrealistic character design) and his voice matches eerily well. He never reaches a level of annoyance high enough to be remotely noteworthy, and in the end just ends up serving as the butt of a few jokes and nothing moreThe musical number is VERY bad, but the bright side is that it's supposed to be. The children are noticeably annoyed by his song, however end up falling for his antics by the end... I was as wellBasically, this review is more or less a defense of the film. It was surprisingly well crafted, and doesn't, IMO, get the recognition it deserves for ending up being quite solid despite it's shoddy constructsPerhaps one needs the correct mindset or attitude to watch and enjoy this film to the degree I did, but I can't say I expected this film to be as good as it is.

I don't understand why everyone disliked this movie so much, I loved it! Me and my mom watched it several times and still find it cute and very funny. People say that the jokes are 'unsuitable for children' but I don't believe that because if your kid understood the joke related to the hoe in the garden, then they weren't sheltered enough to begin with. As a parent, if you have any problems with showing unsuitable jokes I believe that you should have done more research before allowing your child to view it. ALSO, I believe it is wrong to shelter your kids from what they will only learn in school through other kids anyway. Eh, however I do agree with some of you, there was one part in the movie that I was slightly bored by. It was the part when they walked into the house with the ultimate mess and it got all.. mushy and meaningful. They could've directed that better and made it more interesting.

To me this feels almost like a parody of Dr. Seuss than an actual adaption. My biggest gripe though was with the dirty jokes and sexual innuendo. THIS IS A DR. SEUSS MOVIE, DIRTY JOKES HAVE NO PLACE IN THIS!!! I also felt Mike Myers was severely miscast as the Cat in the Hat. What is the deal with that accent. It sounds like a cross between a Yiddish accent and the lion from The Wizard of Oz. That laugh got really annoying after a while too. I really hated the cat costume. It looks like he he got stuck with only two facial expressions and when Myers moves he looks stiff. Do not get me started on the gratuitous scenes such as the cat in dress after getting hit in the balls with a bat or the party booth with Paris Hilton. To say that most of the special effects suck would be an understatement. The one thing that makes it really terrible though is even if you had never heard of the Cat in the Hat or Dr. Seuss and just watched this, you would still say its a terrible movie. Here I quote the Nostalgia Critic, ""By adding grown-up humor, you make it more childish, by modernizing the dialogue you make it more dated and by changing the source material it shows you have no respect for what is already perfect."" Avoid this travesty and read the book and then watch the 1971 cartoon.",The Cat in the Hat

I understood some of the older jokes Myers made, my five year old siblings didn't. They thoroughly enjoyed the movie. They liked Thing One and Thing Two; all the special effects, and just the way the Cat in the Hat destroyed the house. The movie is on right now, and this is about the hundredth time they've watched it. So Mike Myers acting is a little stale, it's still cute. And so Decoda Fanning is playing Sally. She makes a very serious little girl. The movie is still cute, despite the adult content that is spread throughout. The adult content is just trying to entertain the adults that may be watching the movie. And so what if Paris Hilton is displayed for ten seconds during the movie with pig tails in her hair?

I just watched it again now, over ten years since I watched it before. The memories i have of it haven't changed. I remember almost all the jokes and scenes. The ridiculousness of the cat. Though the ones I missed simply replenish my lost thoughts.
The humour isn't meant for adults and I don't think it can be judged by a critic who can already write in cursive. The hours of enjoyment I had watching this full to the brim film proves this. The colours, the set, the props and the dumb plot. I also don't associate this with Dr. Seus's novel. Which I was also read to me as a child. The film is unapologetic in its ludicrousness. It's almost freeing in a way.
People need to see things from a another point of a view sometimes. I think if I hadn't seen this before and watched it now, id question many aspects.

However, The Cat in the Hat laughs at the face of this type of hegemony and shoves a big cork in the mouth of the people who think this way. My suggestion: if you're planning on reading the book; don't. Rather than flipping through pages of mind-numbing information and context written from the mind of ""genius"" Dr. Suess, just watch this movie for enlightening plot twists and character arch's well-beyond the comprehension of the modern man. The negative critics of this movie have no tenacity or knowledge. They are merely brain-washed slaves following the contour of modern-media. Reading all of these negative thoughts about the second coming of Jesus, Mike Meyers, has driven me into severe depression that can only be rectified by enlightening others about the true opinion about the Cat in the Hat.

This movie is what happens when executives get their hands on a film that had potential and throw in things they think are ""edgy"" and ""adult"" when in reality, it makes for an inconsistent and quite frankly inappropriate movie that has no idea what audience it wants.It comes off as childish (in the worst ways possible) in some scenes and even terrifying with it's CGI and make-up in others while also making some adult jokes that feel very out of place in a Dr. Suess movie.For a movie with a talking cat and fish, the movie has some of the worst acting I've ever seen. The two kids playing Conrad and Sally aren't very interesting and their actors give out every terrible performances (though this could be a case of misdirection). Mike Myers feels very miscast as the titular cat and his make-up doesn't help much in either the performance or acting shown in the movie. It also doesn't help that the other actors either ham it up too much or are rather dull.Even the sets (as accurate as they are) feel like something out of a theme park and the movie even has the nerve to basically do product placement for Universal Studios.Basically, what I'm trying to say is please.

Now we laugh and copy the cat; many of his lines have become our household phrases such as ""I'm Sooooo Excited!"" and ""Anything? Anything! Anything? Anything!..."".The trouble with a movie review is that usually people write them after their first time seeing a movie; so only your first impression is taken. What if after seeing a movie 5 times you find that you really do like it but the review you wrote after seeing it once labeled it horrible?

It's not great but it's enjoyable and certainly bears repeated watching, something that is important in a children's film, which brings me to my next point. There is some gross humour in the movie, and some innuendo which will probably go over kids heads, but nothing scary about it that should see it have a more restrictive certificate. My daughter has been watching it on and off since she was 2 and was never scared by it. She loves the idea that a giant cat might be hiding under her bed and that you can make cup cakes out of anything, something she is desperate to try.The best things about it are the production design which is superb and Dakota Fanning who is excellent. As a whole the movie is well paced and well-plotted. The Cat is not the cat from the Dr Seuss books except in the sense that he is mischievous and ultimately educates the children. Other characterisations such as Larry and Mr Humberfloob are enjoyable.The film ends on an upbeat note with up-tempo song, which is important.Criticisms that are valid - maybe this is too much of a vehicle for Myers and those who are looking to see a faithful representation of the Dr Seuss books will be disappointed; go read the books instead.All-in-all, an entertaining morality tale where one child learns to behave responsibly, another learns to have fun, the bad guy gets his comeuppance and where giant talking cats exist.

400,isaacsgs,"Good movie, but could have been better.",8,24 November 2003,"I liked this movie.  It had many funny parts.  The biggest negative I can find, is that there were several scenes where there was almost cursing. They didn't curse, but they ""implied"" it.  There is also several adult humor items.  My 4 year old, liked the movie, and didn't get adult humor.  All in all, a pretty good movie, and I think better than most people are rating it.",The Cat in the Hat
401,kaph,Yuk!- Most tasteless children movie ever made,1,23 November 2003,"The producers had all the ingredients to make a charming, amusing and memorable children's movie and opted instead for a stupid, tasteless script and plot comprised of every crude and vulgar joke you can think of. If Hollywood thinks that this is what kids or adults find funny, they have a very low opinion of the moviegoing public. As a classic movie buff in my 20s, I usually avoid contemporary movies as I find them totally devoid of any charm, decency or subtlety - I thought I could not go wrong with a film based on a famous and beloved character, but I was in for a bitter disillusionment. Mike Mayers as the cat is irritating, one-notey and unappealing and spends the whole time giving a bad and incompetent imitation of Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz. There is not a single funny joke throughout and if the cat's ideas are supposed to be the answer of how to have a good time at home, it gives one quite a clue as to the screenwriters total lack of inspiration. Any 7 year old could have given them more original and fun ideas. The songs and musical numbers are an ordeal to sit through and the plot is non-existent, just a succession of distasteful situations and gross jokes seemingly put together just to fill up some time. You get the feeling you are watching a poorly extended short feature that was initially meant to last no more than 8 minutes. Any well brought up kid will be offended  by the bad substitutes for humor. And I doubt very much that the disgusting, moronic gags are any adult's idea of ""funny"". What a shame such potential was butchered like this. This is the first time I have ever written a negative review, but there is simply no redeeming grace in that one. If you want a genuinely funny and enchanting film about magical characters helping children to find themselves, go back to MARY POPPINS or THE WIZARD OF OZ!",The Cat in the Hat

A Suess character, let alone the Cat, saying these things? These phrases were the first ones repeated by my children when my wife asked them how they liked the movie!As for me, I thought the movie was boring and unfunny, especially Mike Meyers as the Cat. I found it too easy to imagine Meyers himself, or Austin Powers, wearing a Cat suit for a comedy skit.I sat there with my three kids, We sat there for this movie. But the Cat started to swear, And then I felt kinda woozy.Do not take your children to see this tripe. Take them to see 'Elf', a good movie of a better type.",The Cat in the Hat

406,jacksonparisebryce,People are to harsh on this film,8,15 July 2019,"The movie Cat in the hat is a funny, immature movie with jokes for people of all ages. I watched this movie two times. Once as a 7 year old and just finished watching it as a teen. And both times I watched it with two very different experiences watching it.The first time I did as a kid I thought it was funny and found all the jokes I could understand funny, I Thought it was funny when I watched it then and I still do.I just finished watching it literally five minutes ago and I found it just as funny, but for different reasons. There were many dirty jokes that I never even remembered when I was younger.This movie is one of those types of movies you bring your kids to so you can watch it without looking weird as a adult in a kids movie. I had some issues with this movie and at times it was immature, but then I remembered it was a kids movie and it had to be at times.The acting wasn't bad but it was the best. I think they did good with what they had. Somehow Mike Myers was able to pull off being the cat in the hat and I can appreciate that. The kids were good at there parts but still are kids so it's hard to be harsh to Judge a 7 and a 12 year old at there acting. But you barely notice it because of how much was going on.You can't walk into this movie excepting a perfect film. But I guarantee you will catch yourself laughing at some of the jokes and references.All I'm saying is you can either find this movie as a hidden gem or a hot pile of garbage depending on who you are. If your going to watch this movie with your kid I suggest a age where they can laugh at fart jokes yet not ask to many questions.",The Cat in the Hat

413,pink-flamingo,Not My Cup Of Tea,2,24 August 2006,"I really felt that this film was a waste of time to watch. The cat himself was chronic and this is certainly not a film I would recommend. The humour is very dry and some of the punchlines did not even encourage so much as a chuckle. The sets look tacky and low budget(though I'm sure it was not a low budget film)and the music, though lively, does nothing for me. It's very child orientated and not particularly suited to anybody above the age of about 9 years. In it's favour, as the film moves on and the story develops, the standard does increase marginally, although it takes a while to get into it. Unfortunately though, however much my 9 year old sister loves it, and however many Sundays she spends watching it over and over again, this film does not do anything for me, and continues to make me cringe. Sorry.",The Cat in the Hat
414,Jotaro_Kujo421,a cinematic master piece,10,21 July 2020,"I don't know why this movie has such a low score. It's such a cinematic masterpiece. A movie that feels aimed at children with such adult jokes is perfect for the whole family. The children enjoy the action and the parents / young adults get to enjoy the hilarious jokes that were added in. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid and I watched it now as an almost adult and thought the jokes were so dang funny. The cat was just such a great character and I found myself laughing at the complete chaos and randomness happening on screen . And I feel like it came to a nice ending too. Not to mention the pretty good affects for its time. I also really like the detail added in the scenery and settings. The color scheme really matches with dr suesses books in my opinion. Of course it's not completely like the original book, story wise that is, but it's a really good and funny adaption that I really enjoy reliving .Really, if you just want a good laugh , it's a good movie to watch.",The Cat in the Hat

But really, the book itself is only a 5 minute read through. And of course, think about 12 year olds, 'ugh this is the lamest movie ever!' But of course, I was one of those children. But when I went and saw this with my parents, we LOVED it! It was so different from the book and had cheeky adult humor as well. It's only a film to be watched light-heartedly and not be completely criticized. Mike Meyers did a very well done job on a energetic over-sized cat who caused a lot of mischief. I just don't know why so many people hate it? But I really do recommend this film! I first watched it at 12, am now 17 and wish I still had the DVD!!",The Cat in the Hat

I have to say, visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor (if you even think that kind of thing is funny)  I DON'T want the kids that I know to think it is.Don't take your kids to see, don't rent the DVD.

Raucous, tasteless, gross, pointless until the last five minutes, it was certainly the worst film we've ever seen in over half a century of movie-going.This film is a disgrace to Walt Disney's name and reputation.

476,spatharios,the antithesis to 'Grinch' and occasionally inappropriate for kids,1,6 December 2003,"The only positive comments I can make about this movie are 1) the colors were bright, and 2) the character of the young girl Sally was well acted (as were secondary characters such as the fish and Mr Humperfloob (sp?)). That aside, this movie rates as one of the worst I've ever seen and is a far cry from Ron Howard's 'The Grinch Who Stole Christmas.' Since watching 'The Cat in the Hat' was so terrible, I will keep my comments to just a few.The character of the Cat was distinctly un-funny. Those who've seen 'The Grinch' and enjoyed Jim Carrey will be even more appalled at the dearth of energy and humor and the general listlessness of Meyers in this role (and I usually enjoy him). In fact, the entire movie never seemed to find a sense of energy (or humor). What potential there was evaporated upon the appearance of the Cat and never came back.I would advise parents to pre-view this movie before taking a young-one: there are instances of rather blatant sexual innuendo and verbal/situational violence apropos Austin Powers. Overall, 'The Cat' is a betrayal of the spirit of Seuss and fails essentially in every way.",The Cat in the Hat

I watch it for Mike Myers performance of the cat. Cat and the kids are very funny together. Alec Baldwin DOESN'T fit in the film at all. He is about the only thing I have an issue with.

490,john-1717,"Worth renting, not worth buying.",4,18 November 2004,"While many people rate this movie very low, it is one of those bad movies that is still worth watching.The plot is very linear with few, if any, real surprises. The movie does not flow well, but it is consistent. For example, the first few scenes after the cat shows up look like the producer tried to force them in there. When the cat does show up, he is not as alive as I figured he would be. While the book is passive as compared to a live actor playing the cat, I figured with Mike Myers playing the role, the cat would be jumping all over, constantly talking and making fun happen. Instead, I got the feeling that if I were Conrad or Sally I would be bored with the cat.At several points in the movie, a character will hint at a vulgar expression. For example: when the cat has a mishap with the knife, and when he talks about the name of his old car. If this were a movie aimed at a broad audience and maybe with a PG-13 rating I would think nothing of it, but this movie is PG and clearly aimed directly at small children. While there is no swearing, I feel the intent is clear and it is the thought that counts.Despite those comments, I still feel the movie is worth watching if only once. The costumes work well, special effects are good enough not to be noticeably bad, and the humor is good enough to get a laugh the first time through.While not part of the movie itself, the DVD is annoying. Universal inserted advertisements before the menu and the only way through is to fast forward.",The Cat in the Hat

Mike Myers (who usually, I cannot stand) is truly hilarious, and plays a brilliantly awkward yet comedically perfect lead character. Don't be put off by the rest of these negative comments - viewing the film for its literary merits and legacy of Seuss will result in disappointment, but if you want easily watchable, suitably adult and deeply euphemistic film then go for it.

When I was about 7, this movie was popular out there and I remember one day I remember eating lunch with my friends when I was in the second grade and I open up my lunch and the face of the ""Cat And The Hat"" in this movie is on my Lunchable's box and I was so scared, I threw it away. I told my mom that ""I threw it away, It was so scary"" It scared me as a kid. I never went to see the movie when I was kid since I was so scared of it. LOL. A couple weeks ago, I watched this movie online somewhere and I just could not believe how disgusting, crude, abhorrent, obnoxious, dirty and grotesque this movie was. I am sickened that such a revolting film could ever be aimed towards children?!! How the hell is this movie aimed at children? You might as well expose children to pornography and to this movie, it is the same thing! Characters do disgusting things. Dogs urinate all over the place (Who wants to see that without puking?) The Cat shows his ass, literally, they pick their nose, burp, fart and they make innuendos towards swearwords, which is not appropriate and unacceptable for children to watch. There was one scene of Alec Baldwin in this movie living like a pig and in filth and it is just disgusting to show in a children's movie. This movie is dumb, stupid, obnoxious, crude, vulgar, sexually explicit, grotesque and just icky. It is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It is simply garbage and should have never have been made. Dr. Suess' books are made as kind, innocent and sweet and this movie turned ""The Cat And The Hat"" into a perverted, vulgar, filthy, disgusting, urinating, farting, belching, sickening, abhorrent individual. This movie is a piece of trash, the humor is garbage and disgusting and I hope to never see this film AGAIN! And I hope this vile, evil, miserable, icky piece of filth never sees the light of day again. If I could destroy every piece of this movie, I would so do it! The synopsis is, this movie deals with sex, violence and abhorrent subject matter in such a way it offends against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that it should have been classified or produced. I hate this piece of garbage movie so much that I just look at the reviews on this site and Rotten tomatoes.com of this film and just laugh and enjoy them because I love the fact that this movie was such a critical and box office failure.

if you don't like Myers then don't watch it. Quit b*tchin'. Jim Carrey has his version of the Grinch. Myers has his version of the Cat. Hell, now there's an animated grinch and he's nothing like Carrey's Grinch. Quit trying to compare it to what you wanted it to be and just accept how it is...

503,pancrowe,The Greatest Film Ever Made-Flawless,10,8 January 2015,"What can I say? This movie will rightly take its place in the Parthenon of film greats, sitting proudly side by side the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Star Wars (the original 3), The Dark Knight and many others as a landmark in cinema. I'd even go as far as saying that it will sit at the forefront of all these movies.Mike Myers gives a performance for the ages, with an extraordinary depth of character surrounded by a philosophical yet entertaining aura throughout the entire movie. He completely submerges himself into the role of the Cat, and no actor will ever surpass the sublime performance of Myers as this character. The jokes are hilarious (dirty ho springs to mind)and well timed, with faultless CGI and ridiculous attention to detail put into every frame of the film. The screenplay and cinematography are both perfect, and (how many times will I have to use this phrase to describe aspects of this film?) cinema landmarks, elevating the whole plane of entertainment to a different level-they are that ground-breaking. I have never seen, and never will, a movie as well directed as Cat in the Hat. It is a scandal that Bo Welch was not recognized for his pioneering work. But this is not merely the most entertaining and hilarious movie in history. There are an infinite number of thought provoking and soul searching metaphors in this movie, my favourite in particular being the kitchen scene. This scene recognizes that the basic template of life is bland and boring, and that we must encourage our children and peers to innovate and push the boundaries of human knowledge-as demonstrated by the amazing Kupcake-inator. And oh my heavens. The soundtrack. Mozart is rolling in his grave, whilst John Williams, Hans Zimmer, Danny Elfman, Howard Shore and Co are cursing the combination of milk, honey and sugar that Danny Newman has brought to a grateful world's ears. To call it exemplary music would be doing it a disservice, and saying the beauty of angels is woven into every note a gross understatement.I cannot think of a single thing wrong with the Cat in the Hat and I must laud everyone involved in the production of this movie. You have given the human race a gift it doesn't deserve.",The Cat in the Hat

507,gafanhaozachary,"Stupid, ugly movie that should be boycotted at all costs!",2,10 September 2015,"I was scared of this movie when I was 7 and I was 7 around the time it originally came out. I am 19 now and I watched it online somewhere a few months ago and every person that gave this movie a bad review was/is spot on! It is among the worst movie I have ever seen. Not only is it stupid but it is not okay for little kids to be watching and I advise parents to not let their kids see this movie at all, at least until they are about 10. The jokes in the movie were downright lame and tacky. The humor in this movie is disgusting. Nothing but urine, fart, burp, genital and vomit jokes throughout. I can tolerate most stuff but The Cat And The Hat (2003) is among the worst I have seen. Any parent that would allow their kid to see this movie clearly has no common sense or any decency whatsoever. The Cat And The Hat is supposed to be a kids movie and a Dr. Suess movie, but the makers of this film turned it into a vile, abhorrent piece of trash filled with vulgar gags that are unsuitable for children and I am sure not even funny to most adults. The acting wasn't great but it deteriorated once Mike Meyers showed up. God! I swear the make-up on him playing The Cat was downright ugly and disturbing. The Cat And The Hat (2003) is just a horrible, disgusting movie that, like I said early, needs to be boycotted at all costs. Don't let your kids watch it and don't waste your time watching it, it isn't worth it.",The Cat in the Hat

509,loopland,This movie made me laugh out loud!!,9,12 April 2006,"i thought this movie was excellent. I managed to leave my preconceptions of Dr Suess at the entrance to the movie theatre and therefore was able to enjoy this movie for what it was rather than what i expected it to be. I thought the sets were amazing and although the jokes at times were a bit adult in nature it wasn't to the point were you had to explain it to your child. I honestly believe there was something for everyone in this movie and would recommend it to any family to watch. Mike Myers was perfectly cast for this movie, I for one struggle to think who could have put so much life into a talking cat!! (jim Carrey already done one)",The Cat in the Hat
510,dylanatorgator,This movie saved my marriage!,10,12 May 2019,"Never has a movie changed my life so much that I would need to write a review on its comedic genius and beauty. My wife and I really hated each other because we took things too seriously. But then we saw the might of Mike Myers as he effortlessly portrayed the person I am inside. It taught me that I should not be afraid of my desire to be a cat. I will become the cat in the hat. And go door to door to inform people of this incredible film. I will now describe the beauty of this movie in detail, however disregard the creepy moments of the movie that is the only flaw anyone could ever find in this meowvie nay experience! I learned so many words and phrases includinh whatsamajiger and whosamiwhatsit however I disagree with the rating of the movie. I feel the ones who gave it said rating were to little of mind to comprehend the magnificence and darkness of the movie. The cat, obviously, represents the innocence of America's youth as it was taken by a creepy creature or communism. As shown when he unexplainedly appeared in their home unannounced. Conrad represents the evil in our our hearts and must be destroyed. And Sally is what we should aspire to be due to her astounding logical conclusions on matters. The things, are weird and creepy, however and are the only discernable flaw in the movie.",The Cat in the Hat

The film has some amazingly funny catchphrases and his wittiness is comical genius. As for Thing 1 and Thing 2 (or chocolate thunda) they make brilliant sidekicks. So what, the story is a little weak, any kids who watch this will be in stitches I guarantee you!!P.S.

This movie is a must see!!! I could watch it 1095849329 times!!!!! It will never get old. It's humor and colorful ness brings a whole new light to the cinema culture. I used to be terrified of cats but after watching this movie and seeing just how friendly and fun they are, I plan on adopting 20. All 20 cats will be named after characters in the movie. Of course the biggest being named the cat in the hat. I think it's amazing that cats can clean houses, children, and dogs so well! I can't wait to own 20 so my house will always be Immaculate.

My good, is like take the kids to see Clockwork orange, and the tags of IMDb...Family????? Who write that?! I'm calling tha cops bro. The film is not an adaptation of the book, it's something totally different. Not for kids, definitely.I don't understand why people think this is a family film, because a cat appears in the front? This could only happens in 'Murica of course, where my son could get a weapon and it's OK, but then I see with him this movie and the people suppose that I'm gonna be crazy? Hypocrisy everywhere.

The acting was excellent, and the humor was top-notch. Also, I'm in love with Alec Baldwin, and his performance was great. The humor may have been a tad bit offensive at times, but it was still hilarious nonetheless. As a true ensuessiast, the story line was a creative interpretation of the original story. I loved the little added subplots, as they just made the movie more interesting. The joke about the 'canine-American' is still one of the funniest jokes I've even heard, to this day. The ""cat, your tail"" is also great humor, along with the 'anything? anything."" The fish character was added interest. Overall, the movie was one of my top favorites. Humor was hilarious, and the story was something to keep one interested.",The Cat in the Hat

The Cat was as funny as democratic speech. How did this ""Movie"" make it to the Theaters. They try to convey a simple 10 minute into a 90 minute feature length picture in which they do it all wrong. The idea was tedious and pointless. The ""Comedy"" was nothing but lewd and disgusting comments.

I think Heath Ledger must have used this film as inspiration for his groundbreaking portrayal of joker, only it lacks the same level of poise and unpredictable chaos of Mike Myers performance.The film truly captures the zeitgeist of the Gen-Z world of humour and ideology of meaningless content. It was very ahead of its time and will forever remain as a masterpiece. I can't wait for the Criterion box set.",The Cat in the Hat
518,libertyfelix,Hideous abomination...,1,16 July 2007,"Inappropriate. This film is not fit for youngsters and is patently offensive to all but the most crudely insensitive viewers.And the original cat was slender, other than a slight belly. Mike Myers bombed because of miscasting. Dana Carey and an entirely different scripting department might have saved this hideous abomination.Alec Baldwin was the only redeeming factor in the movie. The kids were suitable for portraying the storyline and the dog and fish were certainly cute.But the humor was adult, off-color and inviting of inappropriate mimic behavior by the innocent viewer.Yech!",The Cat in the Hat

It's still great.Plenty of people complain that it was too wild with its jokes and references, but really, the kids don't know what's going on. They're not going to care about the Taiwanese Parliament or hepatitis. They likely didn't get the sexual swinger party reference in ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" (and let's be honest, you didn't either).""But what would Seuss think?!"" the guy had a talent for satire and ridicule. In fact, his more famous works read by children had underlying adult themes. He even illustrated a pretty racist comic for Judge magazine. I think he could handle offensive humor.People who grew up with the movie can now appreciate it in a different light with our new taste for satire and dark comedy, and that's pretty groovy.Go ahead and show it to your kids. They'll either get the jokes or ignore them completely, and if you can take a gag then that's what we call a win-win scenario.",The Cat in the Hat

Sure, there is innuendo, sure there are comments that are going to be picked up by adults and probably not by kids, just like a typical kids movie these days. This movie was campy by design, ridiculous by design, fantastical by design, and full of slapstick comedy and one liners. My whole family has loved this movie since the teenagers were little. We quote it all the time. Maybe it's not some people's cup of tea, and maybe some people over analyze and over think this movie by comparing it to other Mike Myers movies, or ""what could have been"" with other actors, but I think it does a great job standing on its own, and is hilarious.

As such, it should have humor appropriate for kids. This has some slapstick, but the BAs, swearing and semi-swearing, double etendres, and innuendo have no place in it. If my kids were street-wise prostitute punks, they would get the jokes. But my kids are good kids, and the humor went over their heads. However, if you want to take your kids to a movie where the main character actually talks about cutting off a cat's balls (yes, in that same language), then this is for you. If you want to see the Cat in the Hat have a pseudo erection at looking at a centerfold spread of the kids' mom, then this is for you.Terrible dialog, terrible lead acting by Mike Myers, terrible script, EXTREMELY bland camera work (the whole thing could have been filmed on a tripod), color and scene design that was good in theory, but in practice just doesn't work... it just goes on and on.It's just beyond me how something like this can get green-lit. I've watched straight-to-video Land Before Time movies with better pacing, acting, and humor.And I only registered on IMDb for this review, to help draw down the absurd 3-star rating this film got to some lower number.
