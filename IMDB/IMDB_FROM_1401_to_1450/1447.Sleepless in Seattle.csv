0,TheLittleSongbird,"Unshamedly manipulative, and somewhat old-fashioned, but a charming romantic comedy",8,30 May 2010,"Sleepless in Seattle is manipulative and unashamedly so. The fact that it is somewhat old-fashioned is not a bad thing at all, in fact it is done wonderfully. In general, Sleepless in Seattle is just a charming romantic comedy, co-scripted and directed by When Harry Met Sally writer Nora Ephron.The idea to keep Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan apart for most of the movie is a dangerous one, but guess what, I found that it worked! Strictly speaking, Sleeping in Seattle is made up of two story lines, one is about a recently widowed man who moves to Seattle and does nothing but grieve. The other is features a woman journalist from Baltimore, who overhears the broadcast with Hanks's son pouring his heart out about his concerns for dad and decides to track him down.The scenery is striking, the soundtrack is very welcoming, the direction is solid and the script has heart and wit. In terms of acting, both Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan give marvellous lead performances, while Ross Malinger is a nice surprise as Hanks's son. The climax at the top of the Empire State Building takes its inspiration from the 1950s weepie An Affair to Remember(with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr), and is very effective.Overall, a charming and enjoyable film. Hanks, Ryan and Ephron teamed up again for You've Got Mail, which is inferior but still worthwhile. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Sleepless in Seattle
1,bkoganbing,Baltimore And Seattle Connect,8,24 May 2010,"Sleepless In Seattle is truly a film for the Nineties. It's a film that is in part based on the high tech culture that the Nineties spawned with computers and nationwide talk radio. How could have you done a film like this in another time?Well romance is certainly eternal and if the way humans connect is different now, the point is they still connect. And this film takes up the proposition that some folks are fated to be mated.If I had ever done this thing for either of my parents back in the day or something similar I shudder to think of the consequences. But when young Ross Malinger calls a radio psychologist played in voice only by Caroline Aaron about his father it sets off an entire chain of events that make you believe in fate.Tom Hanks is the recently widowed father of Malinger they've just finished burying his wife Carey Lowell and he thinks a change of scenery is in order to assuage his grief. Hanks and Malinger move to Seattle and its from their new home in Seattle that young Master Malinger makes his fateful call. Hanks gets on the phone as well and his story touches female hearts across America and he's known by the moniker of Sleepless In Seattle.One of those touched hearts is Meg Ryan's who is ready to marry Bill Pullman who is playing what used to be called the Ralph Bellamy role. Good old reliable steady Bill, but Meg is hearing a different calling and taking her cues from that Leo McCarey classic, An Affair To Remember she goes in a nationwide hunt for Hanks.More cynical folks than myself would say that Ryan was stalking Hanks and there are laws against it. But if one is fated to be mated than those laws just don't apply.Hanks and Ryan strike just the right note as the fated couple and Hanks has some great scenes with young Malenger. Rosie O'Donnell has a nice bit in this as well as Ryan's equally romantic minded friend who kind of quarterbacks Ryan's moves. Sleepless In Seattle got two Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Song. Nora Ephron directed her own screenplay and the result is a magic romantic film like they used to do even in the high tech Nineties.",Sleepless in Seattle
2,SnoopyStyle,Iconic rom-com,8,8 November 2013,"Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks) is heart broken after the death of his wife. So he decides to move with his son Jonah away from Chicago where he is reminded of her everywhere. Annie Reed (Meg Ryan) is engaged to marry meek Walter (Bill Pullman). One faithful night, Jonah calls into a radio talk show to find a new wife for his dad Sam. Annie is listening and falls in love with the magic.This is in the tradition of great Hollywood rom-coms. The constant referencing to 'An Affair to Remember' only adds to the feeling that this is made by people who watched and loved old rom-coms. That is the intention of Nora Ephron. Her love of those movies really shines through with all the discussion of romance. Tom Hanks and Victor Garber have the hilarious fun scene ridiculing it. And it had the audacity of minimizing the interaction between the leads. Ross Malinger is great as the inquisitive young son, and Rosie O'Donnell puts in yet another brash BFF performance.",Sleepless in Seattle
3,classicsoncall,"""That's a chick's movie!""",7,17 October 2016,"What Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks) was describing in my summary line above was the movie ""An Affair to Remember"". He could just as easily have been talking about this one, and I have no doubt ""Sleepless in Seattle"" will be referenced in another flick at some point in time. Maybe it already has been, who knows? But the funniest part of that conversation was when Sam and his buddy Greg (Victor Garber) got all misty eyed and weepy over the warm hearted 'tender' moments in ""The Dirty Dozen"". That just cracked me up.OK, so it's a chick flick and I'm not. Suspending all sorts of disbelief will get one through the movie, and you almost have to believe the young kid Jonah (Ross Malinger) was indeed in touch with cosmic forces to score a plane ticket to New York City without his Dad knowing about it - how did he manage that one? And as far as his insistence that Annie (Meg Ryan) was THE one for his Dad, that really was a million to one shot.I don't want to get too sarcastic about the picture, it was touching and uplifting in all the right spots, and I'd make a pretty healthy offer if my life could work out like that, but I'm not crossing my fingers. I'm glad at least that potential girlfriend Victoria (Barbara Garrick) got the Jonah heave-ho; can you imagine having to deal with that cackle the rest of your life? Best sight gag in the film, and I don't know if it was meant to be, but did you notice the poster on the wall behind Becky's (Rosie O'Donnell) desk - 'Farmer Shoots 6 Ft. Butterfly!'. Too bad they couldn't work that into the story line. Thumbs up for having Jimmy Durante's voice book-end the film with his takes on ""As Time Goes By' and 'Make Someone Happy'. I can honestly say I saw him sing those for real on variety shows back in the day.",Sleepless in Seattle
4,jboothmillard,Sleepless in Seattle,6,21 July 2006,"For many this is a reworking of An Affair to Remember, and the characters even mention it, but this does have many new moments. Basically Sam Baldwin (Golden Globe nominated Tom Hanks) is interviewed for radio, and one listener is intrigued by his words, Annie Reed (Golden Globe nominated Meg Ryan) hears him say ""I'm sleepless in Seattle"", and she obviously now wishes she could meet him. When opportunity comes she almost takes it, but soon changes her mind, but don't worry, towards the end they both go for it and meet each other and fall in love. Also starring Bill Pullman as the allergic-to-everything Walter, Rosie O'Donnell as Becky, Carey Lowell as Maggie Abbott Baldwin and director Rob Reiner as Jay. If you have seen An Affair to Remember you may know some of what happens, and you are probably right. Hanks and Ryan worked together before in Joe vs. the Volcano, and again after in You've Got Mail. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""A Wink and a Smile"" and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Score for Marc Shaiman and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Meg Ryan was number 75, and Tom Hanks number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 45 on 100 Years, 100 Passions. Good!",Sleepless in Seattle
5,ccthemovieman-1,Stupid In Seattle,2,26 May 2007,"I wonder if anyone else got tired of watching young kids portrayed on screen as smarter than adults? Frankly, I got sick of it watching thousands of movies in the '90s. This movie had a prime example of that idiotic thinking. Note: an obnoxious young kid who talks and acts like he knows more than his father is NOT cute. It's stupid; it's annoying and it's wrong and it's another anti-family message that Hollywood loved to promote during this era. The message: don't respect your parents. You know more than them. Stephen Spielberg was a big proponent of this kind of thinking in many of his early films.Combine that with the always-annoying Meg Ryan, who has yet to make a good movie, and you have an extremely overrated film in ""Sleepless In Seattle. I was not shocked to find out Nora Ephron was a big contributor to this movie, directing it and helping to write the screenplay. This is the same ultra-liberal/secular writer who followed up this film with garbage like ""Mixed Nuts,"" ""Michael"" and ""You've Got Mail.""The characters in this film, beginning with Ryan's ""Annie Reed,"" are simply too unrealistic. Also, it's not recommended you fall in love with someone just by hearing their voice. It might help to get to know the person, in person, for quite some time before making a commitment. No wonder people in Hollywood over the ages can't get marriage right!Overall, a truly sappy movie filled with stupid messages and ridiculously overrated. It's junk.",Sleepless in Seattle
6,moonspinner55,Simple little romantic comedy-drama that somehow attracted millions of weepy people,5,12 June 2005,"Precocious pre-teen calls a radio talk-show and puts his widower father on the line; thousands of miles away, a woman on the verge of marriage hears his plaintive words of love and is smitten. Romantic blather isn't so much nauseating as it is merely adequate ('nice' is a word lots of viewers use). Those who found the chemistry between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan irresistible in the much-superior ""Joe vs. the Volcano"" may feel cheated here (why keep these two stars apart for much of the movie?). The supporting cast of ""colorful"" eccentrics actually fare much worse, with Rob Reiner showing up to give Hanks a boost (they have a horribly facetious conversation about Cary Grant), and Rosie O'Donnell doing the same for Ryan (and looking ridiculous sniffling along with ""An Affair to Remember"" on television). The old, battered cliché of having characters in a movie watching old movies on TV gets a real work-out, and it's telling that ""Affair""--used as an example for the romantics here to follow--wasn't a very good movie to begin with. ** from ****",Sleepless in Seattle
7,sunwarrior13,Contrived But Charming And Satisfying,9,29 December 2011,"Sleepless in Seattle, the sophomore directorial effort from Nora Ephron, is a light romantic comedy inspired by the 1957 film An Affair to Remember as it used both its theme song and clips from the film in critical scenes. The climactic meeting at the top of the Empire State Building is a reference to a reunion between Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember that fails to happen because the Kerr character is struck by a car while en route. The film is a romantic comedy film directed and co-written by Nora Ephron. Based on a story by Jeff Arch, it stars Tom Hanks as Sam Baldwin and Meg Ryan as Annie Reed together with Bill Pullman,Ross Malinger,Rosie O'Donnell,Rob Reiner and David Hyde Pierce.Sam Baldwin, a Chicago architect, loses his wife to cancer. He and his young son Jonah start new lives in Seattle, but Sam still grieves. 18 months later, on Christmas Eve 1992, Jonah—who wants his father to find a new wife—calls into a talk radio show. Jonah persuades Sam to go on the air to talk about how much he misses his wife. Hundreds of women from around the country hear the program, and touched by the story, write to Sam.One of the listeners is Annie Reed, a Baltimore Sun reporter. She is engaged to a sweet, awkward man named Walter but feels there is something missing from their relationship. After watching the film An Affair to Remember, Annie impulsively writes a letter suggesting that Sam meet her on top of the Empire State Building on Valentine's Day. She does not intend to mail it, but her friend and editor Becky does it for her and agrees to send Annie to Seattle to ""look into doing a story on those radio shows.""Sam begins dating a coworker, Victoria, whom Jonah dislikes. Jonah, a baseball fan, reads Annie's letter and likes that it mentions the Baltimore Orioles but fails to convince his father to go to New York to meet Annie. On the advice of his friend Jessica, Jonah replies to Annie agreeing to the New York meeting.While dropping Victoria off at the airport for a flight, Sam sees Annie exiting from her plane and is taken by her, although he has no idea who she is. Annie watches Sam and Jonah playing on the beach together but mistakes Sam's sister Suzy for his girlfriend. He recognizes her from the airport and says ""Hello"", but Annie can only respond with another ""hello"" before fleeing. She decides she is being foolish and goes to New York to meet Walter for Valentine's Day.With Jessica's help, Jonah flies to New York without his father's permission. Sam, distraught, follows Jonah and finds him on the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Annie sees the skyscraper from the Rainbow Room, where she is dining with Walter, and confesses her doubts to him. They amicably end their engagement. Jonah and Sam get on the down elevator just before Annie reaches the observation deck. She finds Jonah's backpack. Jonah and Sam return for the backpack and meet Annie. They leave, Sam and Annie walking off hand in hand.It was obviously contrived and the plot devices were used to manipulate the story but it was a romantic weeper.The team effort of Tom Hanks,Meg Ryan and Nora Ephron made a real effort to make the story work.Also,with two of the most likable stars casted,it was worth the view as they made it possible to be both satisfying and entertaining.",Sleepless in Seattle
8,studioAT,OK. But not the classic everyone claims it is,3,2 December 2016,"Ask people to name one of their favourite romantic comedies and chances are they'll name this one.I can understand why. It's got two likable stars in the lead roles, some quirky supporting characters and a love story as old as the hills.And yet it remained one of those films I felt I should be liking a lot more than I actually was. It was like I was thinking ""it'll get to the bit everyone raves about in a minute"" and then the film ended and I didn't get it.Films are subjective, comedies even more so. For me this film remained just OK, nothing spectacular.",Sleepless in Seattle

10,hitchcockthelegend,A movie! That's your problem! You don't want to be in love. You want to be in love in a movie.,7,23 September 2010,"Sleepless in Seattle is written and directed by Nora Ephron. It's based on a story by Jeff Arch and it stars Tom Hanks as Sam Baldwin and Meg Ryan as Annie Reed. The film takes its inspiration from An Affair to Remember and uses both its theme song and clips from the film in critical scenes. Plot sees Sam recently widowed and tricked by his young son Jonah to chat on the phone about his grief on a late night radio show. His honesty and sadness touches the hearts of America's listening females, particularly Annie, a young journalist who lives the other side of the country in Baltimore.Major smash hit at the box office, where it coined in a $200 million profit before it even made it out for rental, Sleepless In Seattle is the sort of romantic comedy that's almost impossible not to like. OK, there's those who probably have aversions to some of the stars in the piece (tho both Ryan & Hanks are adorable here), but as a story it's warm, sweet and very touching. Ephron's script throws up a number of funny treats along the way, including moments to make the boys smile, while the fact that the potential cross country lovers are kept apart for almost the entirety of the film is smart move that pays off dividends. Admirable support to Hanks & Ryan comes from Rosie O'Donnell & Rob Reiner as the best friends of both, while Ross Malinger as Jonah gives one of the more pleasing child performances from the 90s.It doesn't push the boundaries of light entertainment, but really you would have to be devoid of heart to not feel just a bit better for having sat thru this movie. 7/10",Sleepless in Seattle
11,preppy-3,For romantics only--I'm giving it a 10!,10,2 January 2004,"Annie Reed (Meg Ryan) hears, on a late night talk show, about a young boy Jonah Baldwin (Ross Malinger) and his dad Sam (Tom Hanks) missing their dead mother/spouse. Immediately Annie feels a connection with Sam thinking he might be her soul mate. Problem is she's engaged to Walter (Bill Pullman). Should she track down Sam and see...or stay with sweet, dependable, dull, safe Walter? What do you think?The plot is ridiculous but damned if it doesn't work! The film is chock full of sweet, romantic songs and images. It all leads up to an admittedly howler of an ending on top of the Empire State Building--it was so over the top that, while they were shooting it, director Nora Ephron was muttering under her breath ""Can we get away with this?""! Well...they did! I've got to admit I actually was getting a little misty-eyed at that point. You really don't realize how silly the movie is while watching it. The actors and the sweet, romantic tone of the film really pull you in.Hanks and Ryan were perfectly cast as the leads. They're both very good actors and excellent comedians. Unfortunately, this movie was such a huge hit that Ryan was type cast as a sweet, romantic woman. She's only now getting rid of that image. Pullman is bad in his role but it is NOT his fault. He doesn't have anything to work with--his character isn't even given a last name! He's just there as a plot contrivance. Rosie O'Donnell, however, provides excellent support as Ryans' boss. Also Rob Reiner, Rita Wilson (Hanks' real life wife) and Victor Garber shine in small roles. Also Malinger is very good as Hanks' son. The only thing that bothered me was the constant references to the old Hollywood weepie ""An Affair to Remember"". I HATE that film! If you hate romantic comedies avoid this at all costs. But if you're a romantic, like me, you'll love it! A definite 10!Two great bits (among many):An exchange between Hanks and a date on Hanks' son (who's being obnoxious): ""He's only 8."" ""He's very good at it.""And a hysterical discussion between Hanks, Wilson and Garber about ""Affair..."" and ""The Dirty Dozen""!",Sleepless in Seattle
12,Calicodreamin,Adorable,8,7 July 2020,"Perfectly cliche and endlessly rewatchable, sleepless in Seattle is one of the classics. A cute premise with good acting and well developed characters. It's just... magic.",Sleepless in Seattle
13,SimonJack,"This film turns neurosis into ""magic""",5,18 December 2016,"It should be common knowledge that all movies are fiction. Even historical subjects based on books have dialog made up for characters to suit the scene of the moment. For many films, the stories themselves are fictitious. In those, we give Hollywood considerable leeway. But, when tinsel town touts a story or message as a real possibility, the elements of the story should be reasonably realistic or believable. Otherwise, it risks turning fiction into fantasy. Fantasy goes beyond the realm of possibility and believability. Unfortunately, for ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" the writers and producers went for fantasy. Note the few times the word ""magic"" is used in the dialog. The film even tries to mask some harsh undertones. It's a wild stretch of the imagination to see true love in a character looking for a wild romance. The idea for this movie is novel and had good possibilities. Tom Hanks' portrayal of Sam Baldwin, a grieving widower, is very good. It's about the only realistic and believable aspect of the film. And, the radio talk show is a common thing, including hosts with credentials who offer advice. It's a stretch, but we can grant considerable leeway for having an eight-year-old boy, Jonah Baldwin (played by Ross Malinger) even listening to such an adult broadcast. But, that's the breaking point with reality and possibility in this film. It's too bad the creators didn't try to make the rest of the story believable. Meg Ryan's character, Annie Reed, could have been a real love interest. The movie makers should have tailored her character to be more like that of Deborah Kerr in the film that this movie otherwise parodies (""An Affair to Remember""). Instead, she lives and sleeps with a boyfriend, Walter (played very well by Bill Pullman). She's a daydreamer when she hears the radio conversation of Jonah with Dr. Marcia Fieldstone (voice by Caroline Aaron). She has wanderlust, even though she professes to love Walter, and then gets engaged to him. Other reviewers found this incredulous and noted how the producers masked Annie's dumping of a very nice guy, Walter. He had asthma problems and allergies. He had some far out routines to live with this. Annie shared these, since they were already living together. But, sight unseen the wanderlust Annie falls for a bereaving widower who has a young son. She hears him on the radio. Clearly he must be her true love. He'll surely be more easy to put up with than Walter with all his allergies. Is there not another message here that the producers want quickly to mask? Could it be that for those people with certain quirks, maladies, or deficiencies (that about coves most of us), there isn't a chance of a dream romance such as this coming into our lives? Furthermore, if you have one of these shortcomings, should you not expect to be dumped by your girlfriend (or boyfriends) when she or he or imagines they have found their ""right"" partner ?This film plays on the emotions and longings of many people – men as well as women, for an ideal love and perfect romantic match. When our natural desires turn to daydreams, we become vulnerable, even gullible. Some of the rest of this film is sheer dumb and far-fetched. Others have noted the super intelligence of the two eight-year-old kids. The only reason this movie rates even five stars is for the very good acting jobs by Hanks and Pullman. It's hard to dump on Meg Ryan for her acting. Her role as a neurotic person was so unbelievable that she didn't have much chance to do more than act her flip-flops as she did. I first saw this movie in the theater when it came out. I watched it again recently, but don't recommend it. Unless one wants to give their children ideas about disobeying or disrespecting their parents.",Sleepless in Seattle
14,Mr-Fusion,Hits just right,8,6 November 2021,"A guy who can't get over his late wife and the son that just wants him to be happy. There's a sincerity in that premise that you just can't dismiss. Hanks and Ryan are both ideal as potential lovers separated by a continent, both backed by reliable costars and warm sentiment.. . . and a superb Harry Connick Jr. Soundtrack. My wife introduced me to this and I am indeed a convert. This is a stirring romance in the grand Hollywood tradition. It's hard to not be a softy with this one.",Sleepless in Seattle
15,siderite,Classic love story,7,25 June 2006,"This is a movie that uses the symbolism of early New York, that is Empire State Building and Cary Grant movies, not Twin Towers and terrorism, to bring two people together.Frankly, I thought that without Tom Hanks this whole movie would have sucked big time. I mean, you have one widower, deeply in love with his dead wife, being bullied by his psychotic son into finding a pair. He does so, in a so improbable manner, stumbling repeatedly onto neurotic Meg Ryan and finding the ""magic"" by just glancing at her.I think I liked the movie the first time I saw it, because I didn't read into it a lot. If you do, though, there are all these little marketing queues that make you sick after a while. You see, Meg Ryan's character is about to be married with a gentle and good hearted man. He has no obvious flaws. However, the script makes him allergic to a lot of things, snoring and a bit silly by being old fashioned. In the end, it's a normal thing for Ryan to leave him and for him to accept his fate gracefully, but is it really? The woman Tom Hank's character is dating has a silly laughter, so if the insane son of the man doesn't like her, it's OK to just ignore her feelings. At one time in the movie the boy shouts something about ""Mom never shouted at me"" and I thought ""and look where that got you"".In conclusion, you can't be a real romantic movie fan (like I am not) and not watch this, but still, it's just a silly fantasy about how people should meet and never do.",Sleepless in Seattle

This starts an amazing series of events that winds up as a sequel to a Cary Grant movie.It's sentimental but it is also funny & touching as the power of fate wins out over the practical. Amazingly, Rosie O'Donnell does well in support in her days before she started eating too much fruit cake. Rob Reiner actually turns in a decent screen performance. David Hyde Pierce is here, already warming up his latte for the later Niles Crane role.

20,OllieSuave-007,My favorite romantic comedy!,9,7 February 2014,"This is my favorite romantic comedy, a movie about recently widowed Sam (Tom Hanks) who is seeking a new wife. Sam's son Jonah (Ross Malinger) is also yearning for a new mother and concocts a plan to put his father on national radio. As a result, hundreds of women write to him including Annie (Meg Ryan). While she is engaged, her strange and awkward fiancé led her to think twice on love and to attempt to meet Sam.Filmed and set in Seattle, Washington, this movie captures the beauty and relaxing atmosphere of the city and the coolness and freshness of the city's weather. This setting is perfect in describing Sam and Jonah's sad but hopeful situation in seeking a new chapter in their lives. Busy Baltimore, Maryland describes Annie's hectic life. What results is some fun entertainment seeing all the lengths Jonah goes through to make sure he finds the right woman for his dad and all the lengths Annie goes through to meet Sam. It's captivating to see the unfolding of events throughout the movie as they bring Sam and Annie from opposite sides of the country closer together.The acting was on-the-spot, nothing too overzealous, slapstick or childish, and the plot was steady-paced but intriguing. While this is a romantic comedy, there is a touch of adventure in the story, depicted in Jonah's campaign to get his dad a wife and Annie's campaign in attempts to find him.Overall, one of if not the best romantic comedies - one that would fill your hearts with hope, romance and laughter.Grade A",Sleepless in Seattle
21,Lejink,An affair to forget,2,27 August 2012,"Well, today was a bank holiday and it was pouring rain outside so my wife and I thought we'd watch a family-oriented romantic-comedy, giving ""Sleepless In Seattle"" the nod. It's fair to say my wife liked it more than I did.For me it wasn't really very funny and worse, was guilty of over-sentimentality and coincidence. Nothing against Meg Ryan, but she hasn't got the kind of face that would stop you in your tracks the way she does at the airport with Tom Hanks' character's first view of her. Moreover her ditzy character doesn't seem too different (sans hysterical laugh) from the girl his son is so against him hooking up with.Oh yes, about the son, aged eight going on eighteen, going out with a fellow eight-year-old girl, quoting from Beatles' songs, having adult conversations with his dad and flying to New York on his own. As he would! Of course his toothy grin and mop of hair sweep aside any charges of embarrassing cringeworthiness, or at least that's what the director would have you think.I found the writing clichéd and gauche (a woman character cries when recounting the story of the ""An Affair To Remember"", Cary Grant / Deborah Kerr vehicle which informs much of the plot here; like when was the last time you cried explaining a movie plot), the thirty-something characters are cardboard-thin and irritating plus it seemed there had to be some old romantic song playing in the background of almost every scene.I couldn't get excited by the acting either, there being no chance for Hanks and Ryan to gell as they don't actually get together until their anti-climactic meeting atop the Empire State Building. Bill Paxton gets underused as Ryan's hypochondriac fiancé while Rosie O'Donnell irritates as her overly understanding boss. I have to admit I can't stand these male-female ""buddy"" relationships as demonstrated here by Hanks and Rob Reiner and Ryan and O'Donnell, they play out so artificially.Just about the only good for thing me about this film is that I'll probably seek out the earlier film, confident that it will eclipse this very slack and shallow 1980's production which it regrettably inspired.",Sleepless in Seattle
22,ElMaruecan82,Men Are from Seattle. Women Are from Baltimore.,8,31 May 2018,"""Sleepless in Seattle"", sleeper hit of 1993, was written and directed by the late Norah Ephron, Best Original Screenplay nominee for this film and for ""When Harry Met Sally..."" and director of 1998's ""You've Got M@il"". The three movies, all starring Meg Ryan, and Tom Hanks for the last two, form an unofficial trilogy that explores an idea romances only tend to overfly: ""what does it mean to be meant for each other?"".And each film had an interesting angle. ""When Harry Met Sally..."" was about the evolution of relationships, a man and a woman who couldn't really stand each other until they realize that it was more about ""understanding"". Maturity, coupled with a few failures, highlighted their convergences so they became friends. It all came down to one question ""is friendship an end or a step?"". ""You've Got M@il"" updated the story for the AOL and Internet age, it was about two person who were in ""Harry vs. Sally"" mode for the most part but discovered they had far more in common when they were two computer screens apart.In these two movies, there was a key element: the two protagonists knew each other, so in both cases, you couldn't possibly fall in love with a total stranger. But isn't that notion of stranger or acquaintance overrated? Surely, the rom-com witty sociologist couldn't leave the fairy tale alone and ignore the possibility of two people falling in love without knowing each other, or without sharing more than two minutes of screen-time. I think this is a reason enough to love the film, if it doesn't reinvent the wheel and has it share of forgivable contrivances, let's give the credit to Ephron to have made a romance whose concept is beautifully rendered in the poster where the two protagonists stare at each other while obviously being many time zones apart.""Sleepless in Seattle"" has a shamelessly romantic premise but it knows how to insert it into the realities of life. The first minutes are sad and emotional and shows a man devastated by the loss of his wife and wisely telling his young boy Jonah (Ross Malinger) that it's no use asking why these things happen (or was it a voice-over?). The man is Sam Baldwin and he's played by Tom Hanks in one of his last long curly-haired ""comedic"" roles. After the film, he'd cut them short for ""Philadelphia"" and the rest of the decade and become Hollywood's darling. I just miss pre-millennial comedic Hanks although comedic isn't necessary indicative of his role. So Sam understand that staying in Chicago is a no-option as it will constantly remind him of his wife so he moves to Seattle, and the opening credits start.Meanwhile we meet Annie, an optimistic woman engaged with Walter, the nicest man ever but who seems to suffer from every kind of allergy, the man is played by Bill Pullman, and I'm glad that for the most ungrateful role as the disposable fiancé, they picked someone who could have been believable in Hanks' shoes. Ryan is just adorable as the idealistic girl floating on a cloud until a fateful night where she listens to a radio program named ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and where Jonah talks about his father's difficulties to mourn his mother, later Sam takes the phone and opens his hearts to millions of listeners, especially female, creating the first and unique cinematic collective case of ""love at first hearing"".Annie doesn't exactly love Sam but she just can't resist contemplating the possibility that he might be the one, there's something just too formal with Walter and she's scared at the prospect of spending her whole life with ""what if"" questions. Sometimes, love doesn't come from the person than the idea of this person and how it would hold up. I guess the most interesting part from the film is that Sam wasn't stuck in his ""lonely widower"" position and decided to take the reins of his life and date women, and even more surprisingly, there was some genuine chemistry with Victoria (Barbara Garrick) but it seems like her hyena-like laughing was the equivalent of David's allergy, the obligatory mood killer.I'm not sure I liked the way Jonah behaved, too precociously at times to be believable but those where the 90's. And you've got to appreciate the way the film allows these contrivances to happen but without undermining our own feelings about Sam and Annie being meant for each other. There's a moment where Annie is shown peeling an apple in one long spiral and later, the pay-off comes when Sam tells Jonah that it's details like this that made his mother so unique to him. The film also takes the right distance from its own concept by allowing Sam and Annie to ""meet"" at two separate instances. Naturally, the romance does an excellent job at creating the perfect missed opportunities, we know the game, we've been there, and it's part of the deal.And at that point of the review, my only regret is that I didn't see ""An Affair to Remember"", I would have loved to juxtapose the two movies. But I love how the film is used as a running gag showing that there are a few irremediable differences between men and women (something that wouldn't pass today given the current gender ramifications, characters would ask ""what's a man?"", ""what's a woman?"") and I love how the film is used as leitmotif, just as other impossible love stories like ""Casablanca"" in ""When Harry Met Sally..;"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"" in ""You've Got M@il"".And it's interesting you know because Ephron separates between love as-in-the-movies and love as-in-her-movies, but at the end, they just work the same, maybe the underlying message is ""yes, real life can work like in the movies"".",Sleepless in Seattle

The script is weak even by the genre's standard, Meg Ryan and Rita Wilson both overact in scenes that would have been better restrained, and the soundtrack is annoyingly ridiculous in trying to cue up some bouncy tune or other that 'fits' throughout the movie. The result is a packaged, glossy mess of a film that I began almost disliking down the stretch despite its feathery lightness (and Tom Hanks, man, he is always good). It's a creampuff of a movie which may fit the bill for some night and company, and I'm sure I liked this one better years ago, but now it just seems to lack sincerity and depth.

Even though this has the typical aspects of a romance movie, I still enjoyed it from beginning to end.This is about a grieving husband who just lost his wife. With the help of his son, he goes on radio to tell his story. There are many women who fall in love with him because of that story including this one girl from Baltimore who wants to meet him.Tom Hanks is another reason why I watched this. He is a fantastic actor and shows it here. I thought Meg Ryan was so-so. I really didn't care for her character.Overall, this is a decent movie even by my standards.

27,callanvass,"I don't gush over it like many people do, but it's certainly charming",6,20 March 2014,"Sam's wife Maggie passes away, forcing Sam Baldwin and his son to move to Seattle. Because of Sam's elongated depression, and inability to socialize, Jonah calls in on a radio show, hoping to get a wife for his father. Sam is rather displeased with Jonah, but goes along with it. Meanwhile, Annie Reed is stuck in a stagnant engagement with fiancé, Walter (Bill Pullman) Annie listens to Sam's heartfelt speech about his deceased wife, causing Annie to get rather infatuated with Sam. She writes Sam a letter, suggesting they meet on the Empire State Building. Sam likes the sound of Annie, but he has to stop his dad from making a big mistake with another woman. I'm a big fan of romantic comedies, but I never understood the hype from this movie. Yes, its charming. Yes, it's cute, but people act like it's one of the all time greats. I don't think it's anywhere near deserving of that type of praise. I've never seen ""An Affair to Remember"", but this type of stuff doesn't happen in real life. Your suspension of disbelief is a must with this one. If you can get into the outrageous plot, you'll more than likely find a decent amount to like about this one. It milks everything it can out of the unbelievable plot with two of the greatest movie stars in the history of cinema. Unlike You've Got Mail, this movie features wonderful performances. Tom Hanks is at his charming best, showing all the right emotions. Meg Ryan is the queen of romantic comedies, and there is a reason for it. Even watching her sing Jingle Bells manages to make me smile. I had a crush on Meg Ryan, who didn't at one juncture? Her character is sassy and enjoyable in this one. Ross Malinger is solid as the kid. He had some great gag scenes, holding his own against some amazing actors as well. Bill Pullman is OK as Ryan's fiancé, but a tad too dry and dull for my liking. I hate it when non-actors get a huge supporting role in a movie, especially someone I detest like Rosie O'Donnell. Surprisingly enough, she was tolerable here, and dare I say, enjoyable at times? The ending always makes me smile. I like how they ended things with a bang, yet subtly as well. It was a nice touchThey tried to produce the same formula in You've Got Mail, only it failed miserably. This film is imperfect itself, overrated as well. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy it, because I do. i just don't go crazy over it like many do. 6.8/10",Sleepless in Seattle
28,slightlymad22,I Love It,8,26 February 2015,"I will not lie to you, I will admit right from the off that I am biased. I love this movie.Plot In A Paragraph: Eighteen months after losing his wife, Sam (Tom Hanks) is still grieving and can't sleep. His eight year old son Jonah (Ross Malinger) misses his mother, but he wants his father to get a new wife despite Sam having not even contemplated dating again. On Christmas Eve, Jonah calls a national radio talk show and ask for a ""new wife"" for his Dad. Sam ends up pouring his heart out about his magical and perfect marriage to his late wife, and how much he still misses her. Among the many women who hear Sam's story and fall in love with him solely because of it is Annie Reed (Meg Ryan) a Baltimore-based newspaper writer. Who is drawn to Jim based on his story, despite already being engaged to Walter (Bill Pullman) 1993 was a massive year for Tom Hanks with both this movie and ""Philadelphia"" being huge hits. Both are very different, but are equally brilliant. As is Hanks. He is heartbreakingly excellent as the widower. Amazingly the role of Annie was originally offered to Julia Roberts, who turned it down. Kim Basinger also turned it down because she thought the premise was ridiculous (Good move Kim!!) After Michelle Pfeiffer, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jodie Foster all declined as well, Meg Ryan landed the role. I surprised this role was not wrote with Ryan in mind as this type of role was her bread and butter back then. She was perfect for this type of role. Rosie O Donnell is solid support to Ryan as is Bill Pullman, and Ross Malinger manages to avoid all the cliché's of most chicks actors! Well directed, with a sharp and witty script. I will add I also liked the fact that they didn't feel the need to make the Bill Pullman character a jerk (as is usual the case with his type of role in romantic comedies) One of my favourite Tom Hanks movies, one of my favourite Meg Ryan movies and one of my favourite romantic comedies. I don't own many romantic comedies. But this one is in my collection.",Sleepless in Seattle

Then, I thought Meg Ryan lived in my favorite town, New York, whereas she lived in Baltimore.But even without those setbacks, the movie didn't catch my eyes: Sure, the map scenes, the parallel doors, the apple gimmick are fun. The idea that the radio was (is?) the best tool to keep humans closes in a infinite world is evident.But the director try to give a intemporal flavour & I particularly saw an out-of-time story. And above all, the background story hurts also my values: how can someone can decide a 360° turn in her sentimental life when she committed a few days ago for her future wedding? My actual single life explain my intransigence: all those stories about ""wrong"" choices are very painful for me because when you got the freedom to choose, you can't be fooled !

I was as well back then...What makes Sleepless in Seattle stand out above all the other rom coms is the genuine, yet funny portrayal of feelings of heartbreak. It starts out as a movie about a guy who does NOT wanna find a new love though. That UNromantic start is refreshing for this genre.There are few romantic movies that come as close to capturing the dreams of so many people of finding the one and only true love. Sleepless in Seatlle has got it!
Especially recommended to watch around the christmas holidays, but this movie will inspire anyone's dreams about finding true love if only for 90 minutes long. Any bad? Yes, this movie is one big pile of cliches, but they are such enjoyable cliches. Yes, it is using those very sentimental romantic songs, but they are so irresistably good, however corny they might sound.

The movie stars Tom Hanks as a widowed father who has to rear his young son Jonah all by himself as he lost his wife. So he ends up moving from Chicago to Seattle and we are introduced to Annie Reed(played by Kate & Leopold star Meg Ryan who looks very pretty here may I add and unlike her other charcther in that other film I have mentioned)who is engaged to Walter(played by While You Were Sleeping star Bill Pullman)and Annie is sharing Christmas with her family with Walter. So when she leaves her parents house she turns on the radio in her car and hears a young boy wanting to make a request for his dad to find a wife and love again. Annie feels so sorry for the young boy she ends up writing a letter to him to give to his dad (Tom Hanks) and from here on in its all about destiny and faith to bring Annie and Tom Hanks' charcther together. So will they won't they? Overall I found this movie to be actually really nice. Its definitely up there as one of my favourite romantic movies of all time next to the likes of Titanic and While You Were Sleeping.The soundtrack is very old- fashioned,and parts of the movie is referring to that Cary Grant romantic movie An Affair To Remember where the charcther waits for his soulmate on top of the empire state building and he waits and waits for the woman to arrive. This also happens towards the end of the movie. Now my only nitpick with this movie is Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks chemistry.,don't get me wrong these guys have worked together three times before; Joe Versus Volcano,this movie and of course You've Got Mail where they had chemistry as their charcthers in that movie. Here they don't spend that amount of screen time together and I wish they did because there charchters in Sleepless In Seattle were perfect for each other. But hey I guess the late Nora Elphon wanted it to be like An Affair To Remember as well as trying out something different where its all about faith and destiny and not on the two charcthers to kiss at the end.Overall I give it a 7.8/10",Sleepless in Seattle

An Affair To Remember is the movie which has been folded in, and it works well to create a wonderful by product, though it is only a by product.As the formula goes, this is probably Meg Ryan's best romantic comedy, and while it will soon become dated, it will survive the ravages of time for most fans of both this genre and this work itself.I consider this one of the sweetest in the genre, and while I like 50 First Dates better, this is still completely sweet, if unlikely.It rates a 7.5/10 from...the Fiend :.",Sleepless in Seattle
35,elshikh4,So Naive !,5,30 October 2008,"There is a magic in movies whether it's (An affair to Remember) or (The Dirty Dozen). And what (Sleepless in Seattle) is trying to show is that the movie magic can be real. However, it deals with the matter of movie-becomes-real so cinematically and falsely!It's the ultimate girly dream comes to life, and an invitation for men to be less realistic and have faith in the girly dreams. It was made by what used to be taken as ""girly stuff"" where all the ""it was meant to be"" routine rules. The problem is that this romance was too adolescent. It didn't convince, or try to, under the influence of its belief that love doesn't make sense!Simply (Nora Ephron)'s dream wasn't a very well-made. She didn't put much effort into it; which exposed it as just absurd ""coincidence"", not ""fate"". Her fantasy didn't possess more details and a coherent inner-logic, even as a fantasy, to hit the mark. So without much approach, smarter coincidences, or even less coincidences; the whole thing looked not as love at first sight, inasmuch as love at sights!Look at the climax, you wouldn't know if this love story could continue or not, originally work or not, because the drama sunk foolishly in its dream and the hasty desire to fulfill it anyway. And regardless of (Ryan)'s fiancé as ""allergic"" person being mocked at (which got on my nerves badly since I'm one!), I couldn't stand the sudden, very easy, change of him at the end. But driven by the desire to present, even forcedly, a wow finish or extremely happy ending, it attained being fabricated. Hence while that climax seems as a nice fun, it satisfies itself with what it says more than satisfying us; which makes you feel that this is the ultimate ""basket case"" movie. So, why not to witness, for instance, the 2 leads talking or dealing? Ahh, because it would ruin the fantasy! If you think that reality could include it, then Amen.. You're a Believer, and no more sleepless. Yet, it can't deny how the movie reports that to us in kind of sleepy way!So as a romantic comedy, it wasn't that romantic or that comic. It wasn't enough to hire (Tom Hanks) and (Meg Ryan) to feel the comedy. Even the light moments, the funny lines, were so few. And lacking comedy as the accurate logic for great random accidents (or what seem so) of which the movie deals with--weakened the romantic part eventually too.As for the positive points: let's admit that it somehow has a different plot. Watching inevitable lovers-to-be before their first actual meeting was amusing. The movie stands alone in propagating how life is open to far experiences. (Hanks) and (Ryan) were sweet, even if separately. It deals with old movies as invaluable, which's a rare nostalgia to find in a movie for another movie. And hands down, the scene of (Hanks) and (Victor Garber) crying over (The Dirty Dozen) was the best. You can connect between its fact as ""completely improvised during the take"" and (Ephron)'s not too fine ability in writing comedy!The movie indirectly tells you a lot about cruel world; where dreams are from movies, by movies, through movies. It's a case of a movie that lost any faith in reality to have faith in reality's magical area, looking forward to the exceptional right thing to happen. Of course life has more fantasy movies than you can imagine. It's the origin of all the imagination in the first place. However, I think (Sleepless in Seattle) is one of the worst movies to assure that, despite its well meaning.Also it says something about how we must let the hearts, not the minds, lead the way whatever haphazard, absurd, and visionary that would sound or could be. Though, it encourages ""believing"" in that and pays no attention to making it ""believable"" (because love is unbelievable.. Got it?!). This is not romance; this is very cinematic romance which ends up as just implied love letter for the old Hollywood, and the dream in us.It works like a smooth bubble. And if it spreads the message of ""go for your dream"" so it succeeds, but less effective and so artificial compared to any movie that it pays homage to. Sorry, as a love story, this is so naive. However, that could be perfectly its basic purpose: Love is naive!",Sleepless in Seattle

The movie is awash with abject sentimentality to the point of being outright maudlin. Yet this is a wonderful movie. Yes, a WONDERFUL MOVIE! Now you ask: Why is such a maudlin movie so wonderful? The answer is because of two of the finest actors in Hollywood today, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Their portrayal of two lonely people searching for love and unwilling to settle for second-best transforms a meandering script into a story that will touch anyone who has ever felt lonely or isolated or has suffered a loss of someone close and special to them. Indeed this movie deals candidly with the challenges associated with trying to meet someone in a society that fosters isolation, fear and outright paranoia.

Tom Hanks, who effectively flexes his solemn-face muscles for most of the picture, is the titular ""Sleepless,"" a widower who doesn't believe in love after loss and can't close his eyes without getting tangled in painful memories. When his son convinces him to sit in on a call to a self-help radio program, he gains fame among the desperate middle-aged set. Mixed in among that pack is a not-quite-ready-to-be-married Meg Ryan, who obsesses over him to a worrying degree. It would be curious to see this play out with the roles reversed today - would it be dubbed a timeless romance or a dark dose of suspense? I was on the hook for that first act, but when the tone shifted to allow for more punchlines it lost its way and bucked me into the dirt.

46,gcd70,Feel good romance,6,30 November 2007,"Audiences worldwide have fallen in love with ""Sleepless in Seattle"", a real box office 'sleeper' if ever there was one. Nora Ephron's film is taking considerable business away from Spielberg's and Schwarzenegger's big summer attractions.It's a simple movie about destiny, as two complete strangers who live on opposite sides of the U.S. are inexorably drawn together by unseen forces. Romantics who enjoy this type of 'made for each other' love affair will probably really get a kick out of this feel good flick.Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan and all the cast are good, but what really made the film for me was the comedy, which is often very funny. Lots of fun.Note : this is a very predictable movie, so cynics beware!

48,dierregi,Contrived to the utmost,2,16 March 2014,"Romantic comedies are very difficult to get right. This ""old classic"" signed Nora Ephron is a good example of everything that can go wrong. Built on the success of ""When Harry met Sally"", we have cute heroine Meg Ryan playing one of her romantic leads roles, inclusive of tics and weirdness that were her trademark. She could easily be a slightly older version of Sally, with a worse haircut. This time, her character is called Annie and she lives in Baltimore.Annie is engaged to Walter, whose main defect is being dull. This must be a terrible crime in Ephron's book, since Walter is treated with zero respect. One night, Annie listens to Sam's phone call to a radio station. Sam is a young widower, living in Seattle with his son Jonah. Just listening to his story Annie fells for him.Many criticized this idea of falling in love, which however is not the worst point of the movie. People fall in love for lots of different reasons, so I could buy Annie falling for Sam and trying to meet him. What I do not buy is the artificiality of all the events presented after that.Annie is a journalist and manages to be sent to Seattle to meet Sam, but somehow manages not to do so, even if she sees him twice (and he sees her too, managing to fell in love at ""first sight""). They do not exchange words, even if she could have waited for him and introduced herself in a normal way. But that would have been way too dull for Ephron.Then there is a letter which makes unbearable Jonah instantly like Annie. Jonah tries to push Sam to meet Annie on top of the Empire State Building on Valentine's Day. This is contrivance at the highest level, built in the script together with many references to the movie ""An affair to remember"". Since neither Sam nor Annie live in New York, this ""romantic"" meeting on Valentine's is supposed to prove that ""love at first sight"" does exist and can even be the basis for a long lasting relationship.. or whatever.What I got instead, is an overlong, unfunny movie where the two leads meet only at the end, which is certainly not the way I like on screen romances to go.",Sleepless in Seattle

Sleepless is a sweet and utterly delightful romantic comedy which contains many necessary ingredients to make a movie of this genre good. It is engaging. It is sweet. And it stars Hanks and Ryan who seem to define the word adorable with their screen chemistry. Not a bad combination.Sleepless is a modern day romantic comedy with a touch of old style romance. The incredibly romantic ending and musical score help to make this movie a truly enjoyable romantic comedy to view.This is tons better then Hanks and Ryan's later effort, You've Got Mail, which I think, tried to hard. Sleepless is in the same category as a movie like pretty Woman, in that, while many elements are unrealistic, it manages to stay completely delightful all the same and anything that maybe over the top can be overlooked because of the movie's sweetness. This is a genuinely good romantic comedy.",Sleepless in Seattle
53,PredragReviews,"Love is a Journey of the Heart, not the destination.",9,13 May 2016,"This movie really benefits from a strong cast of good actors and an excellent soundtrack. The more I study romance movies the more I see that there plotted where a suitor male or female must quest after the love of their life and that fate or destiny brings them together despite long odds. I guess that's the where the idea of 'romantic,' comes from as I've always understood it to mean. To quest after a nearly unobtainable goal.Meg Ryan, as well, is an accomplished actor who can play drama as well as comedy (check out her performance in ""When A Man Loves A Woman""), but she really sparkles in romantic comedies like this one, and she is absolutely perfect for the role of Annie (just as she was for her role in ""You've Got Mail""). She makes Annie a very real person, and through her we can empathize with Sam's situation, as she enables and allows the audience to experience what she is feeling right along with her. Ryan, through her character, makes that emotional involvement possible, and it's one of the strengths of the film. And like Hanks with Sam, Ryan makes Annie a character you're going to remember. The exemplary supporting cast includes Bill Pullman (Walter), Rita Wilson (Suzy), Victor Gerber (Greg), Tom Riis Farrell (Rob), David Hyde Pierce (Dennis), Dana Ivey (Claire), Gaby Hoffman (Jessica) and Rob Reiner (Jay).So begins a romantic odyssey that probably could only happen in the movies, but it makes no difference because in Ephron's capable hands, this story works, and it works beautifully. There's a line in the movie, in fact, that kind of sums it all up: Becky (played by Rosie O'Donnell) says something to the effect to Annie that, ""You don't want love, you want ""movie"" love. And maybe that's why this movie is so endearing and enduring; it's about the kind of love you find in a perfect world, the kind of love everybody wants and needs (though few will admit it, even to themselves) but rarely finds, and Ephron knows exactly how to make it connect with her audience. It has to do with understanding basic human needs and knowing how to translate it all into a cinematic art form that will effectively reach those who see it.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Sleepless in Seattle
54,philip_vanderveken,"Not bad, but only for the real fans of this kind of movies",6,4 July 2005,"Sometimes I really wonder what all those juries and committees are thinking when they nominate a movie for an Oscar or some other big award. ""Sleepless in Seattle"" for instance hasn't got all that much special to offer, but still it was nominated for many awards. Sure, it was a romantic comedy in a time not that many had been made before. It was something new, romance always sells and there were some very likable actors to be seen in it, but they didn't even get a nomination. No, the Oscar nomination was for the music and the script...The movie starts with showing us Sam Baldwin who has been recently widowed, who now lives in Seatlle, together with his 8-year old son Jonah and who is convinced that he will never be able to love again. But that's not what his son thinks. Jonah thinks that his father needs a woman in order to get his life back in order and calls in on a nation-wide radio-show. The story of Sam is heard by hundreds of women, including Annie Reed, who is about to marry her fiancé Walter. But she can't forget about Sam and wants to know for sure that he wouldn't be the one for her. She travels from Baltimore to Seattle and decides that Sam isn't the one. But the letter that she wrote for him, but never posted, is posted by one of her friends. Jonah who is convinced that Annie is the best option, arranges a meeting on top of the Empire State Building and books a flight for his dad without telling him...When a script is nominated for an Oscar, you certainly can expect some fireworks from it. At least, that's what I hope for and that's exactly what I didn't get from this movie. It tries a bit too hard to work on the people's sentiments (being lonely on Christmas time, romantic appointments on a special location,...). It all was a bit too much from time to time. On the other hand I must also say that there was some fine humor to be seen in it as well. Especially when they were talking about other movies, I had some very good laughs. For instance the scenes where they talk about ""The Dirty Dozen"" and ""Fatal Attraction"" were excellent. But overall that just isn't enough to save the entire story. What I liked better was the acting. Even though not always very stunning, I certainly enjoyed Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.Overall this is a movie that will be loved most by the people who are big fans of romantic comedies. I'm not one of them, although I can certainly enjoy some of them, especially when they are full of some fine humor. But a movie that makes fun of romantic movies (when someone says 'A movie! That's your problem! You don't want to be in love. You want to be in love in a movie') and than ends up in the same trap that they are making fun of, isn't exactly my idea of a great movie. That's also the reason why I give it a score between 6/10 and 6.5/10.",Sleepless in Seattle

57,frankde-jong,"A typical Ephron movie about a couple that is made for each other, but has trouble coming to that conclusion on their own.",7,5 November 2021,"""Sleepless in Seattle"" is a pleasant feel good movie that can be seen multiple times (usually a good quality indicator). The dialogue maybe somewhat less sharp than in ""When Harry met Sally"" (1989, Rob Reiner), but in that film Nora Ephron only had to care about the screenplay. In ""Sleepless in Seattle"" she was director as well. The montage of the last scene (are they meeting one another or not?) is in the best tradition of parallel montage since D. W. Griffith.The film has some funny running gags such as all the women getting emotional from ""An affair to remember"" (1957, Leo McCarey) while all the men become excited about ""The dirty dozen"" (1967, Robert Aldrich). I suspect ""Sleepless in Seattle"" will be looked upon as a women picture but, as said before, I didn't mind watching the movie either.Already in ""When Harry met Sally"" Ephron (as screenwritter) collaborated with Meg Ryan. In ""Sleepless in Seattle"" (the characters played by) Ryan and Tom Hanks did have the right chemistry. Hence Ephron used the same lead actors in ""You've got mail"" (1998), more or less a remake of ""The shop around the corner"" (1940, Ernst Lubitsch), replacing letters for e-mail. Although the proverb says that you must never change a winning team, ""You've got mail"" felt too much as exploiting successes from the past.While writing this review I suddenly realised that all the above mentioned Ephron films are about couples that are made for each other, but have trouble coming to that conclusion on their own.",Sleepless in Seattle
58,TheUnknown837-1,"""Sleepless in Seattle"" is one of the more significant romantic comedies of the last 20 years.",7,16 September 2012,"""Sleepless in Seattle"" comes very close to being the ideal contemporary American love story, and even with my reservations about some of the things in the film, I still feel it's a very good one. It's an unpretentious little jewel that demonstrates the true values of screen writing and acting, as both are used here shamelessly and with natural grace to manipulate the emotions of the audience. I admit the story is a bit absurd, but it's also somewhat the idea. And besides, in this age where people travel hundreds of miles to meet folks they've chatted with on the internet, is it so hard to believe that a woman would cross the entire country to learn about a widower whose voice she heard on the radio? Well, the Casanova in me would like to think it's not.The plot, though predictable, makes some daring twists. In most romantic comedies, the couple eyes each other from very early on. And although Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan do make an attractive movie-couple, they don't share even have a two-shot until the last ten minutes. For most of the movie, Mr. Hanks does not even know that Miss Ryan even exists, let alone that they are destined to be in love. It's not that he ignores her; it's because she spends most of the movie on the opposite side of the country from him. She hears him on the radio, speaking of his recently departed wife, is fascinated by what he has to say, and feels something that is best described, as the movie acknowledges, as ""magic."" I could use more derisory words toward somebody who would feel this way in real life about a voice, but that's good enough.The screenplay (written by director Nora Ephron and two men—Jeff Arch and David S. Ward) is also a bit insightful on, again, an unpretentious level. It does not delve deep into the psychological state we like to call love and affection, but it does make some interesting observations. First of all, Miss Ryan's character does acknowledge time and time again how absurd it is of her to fly from New York to Seattle to learn about a man she's only heard. There are also numerous touches upon how Hollywood's perception of sex and romance befalls some people. The key moment is when Rosie O'Donnell, as Miss Ryan's best friend, tells her flat out while watching ""An Affair to Remember"" that what she wants is not to be in love, but ""to be in love in a movie."" After all, how many of us—single and once-single—have not looked at movies like ""Casablanca,"" ""An Affair to Remember,"" ""At First Sight,"" and such and not fantasized about passion that only seems to exist when an actor and actress play make-believe before a camera?Speaking of other films: that is another thing I adored about ""Sleepless in Seattle."" It has an uncanny ability to recall other films to effect—sometimes comedic, sometimes insightful. A favorite moment of mine is when Mr. Hanks explains to his eight-year-old son (extremely well-acted by Ross Malinger) why he is uncomfortable about rushing into a new relationship so soon: he asks him if he ever saw ""Fatal Attraction."" The biggest homage(s), though, goes back to ""An Affair to Remember."" That wonderful 1957 film is shown on television screens numerous times throughout the movie, and at key points, Hugo Friedhofer's score even plays on the soundtrack. Being an obvious admirer of the said film, I found the references quite delightful and charming.If there is one thing I couldn't stand about ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" I would have had to have been the constant usage of classic songs to carry along sequences. The opening credits display while a very jazzy version of ""As Time Goes By"" thumps in the background, but numbers such as ""Stand By Your Man,"" ""Stardust,"" and others are ever-present, reducing fine scenes into what appear to be limp music videos. There is a potentially great moment—reduced to a merely good one—where Miss Ryan, having traveled to Seattle, watches Mr. Hanks and his son as they play on the beach. It's a very good scene (Miss Ryan is kept at medium shots, Mr. Hanks and Mr. Malinger at distance, the montage is very nice) but the song playing in the background trivializes it. The film's musical score by Marc Shaiman is just fine, and I would have preferred to hear his piano motifs instead of a song.Only the movies can convince that two people could fall into deep, passionate love upon first sight. ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is one of the defining examples of that theory. After all, if Mr. Hanks and Miss Ryan could have such strong chemistry when they are not even sharing the same frame, one can only imagine what would lay down the road for their characters (and how moved we would be). But what is best about this movie—apart from the fabulous writing and acting—is its unostentatious manner. It does not make itself out to be any big deal, and just lets the romantic chemistry emerge on its admittedly old-fashioned terms. And I was more interested in the relationship between these people who have never met as opposed to most formula-films where the cute-boy meets cute-girl, they ogle for an hour, hate one another for twenty minutes, and reconcile at the end. ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is one of the more significant romantic comedies of the last 20 years.",Sleepless in Seattle
59,jhclues,Let's Talk About Love,10,10 November 2001,"Regardless of how cyberspace has seemingly diminished it's size, the world is still an awfully big place, and it's impossible for any one person to occupy more than a minuscule portion of it at any given time.  So it's imperative that individuals find that special niche for themselves, that little piece of the world that becomes their own, where they can live and love and engage in the pursuit of happiness.  And once that `perfect' world is created, it's devastating when something upsets the balance, as in the case of this film, the death of a spouse.  When the love of a lifetime is abruptly taken away, how does one recover?  Can one recover?  How do you go on when your heart has been removed?  All valid questions that are explored and addressed in Nora Ephron's touching and romantic `Sleepless In Seattle,' starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.  The film begins on a somber note, with the funeral of Maggie Baldwin (Carey Lowell), respectively the wife and mother of Sam Baldwin (Hanks) and his son, Jonah (Ross Malinger).  Maggie was the love of Sam's life, and inconsolable after her passing, he decides the best thing for himself and his son is to move to another city and try for a fresh start.  So they head west as far as possible, to Seattle, where Sam remains unable to emerge from the funk of his loss. 	 	Christmas and New Year's is especially tough on Sam and Jonah, and around this time Jonah happens to tune into a late night talk show featuring Dr. Marcia Fieldstone (Caroline Aaron), whose job is to help her listeners with their problems.  Jonah calls her and tells their story, then takes the phone to his dad in the next room, and in deference to his son, Sam consents to talk about his situation on National radio.  In the Baltimore area, writer Annie Reed (Ryan) is listening, and touched by the sincerity in Sam's voice, she cajoles an assignment that subsequently takes her to Seattle, where she attempts to hook up with Sam, a man she knows only as a needful, disembodied voice from the radio.	So begins a romantic odyssey that probably could only happen in the movies, but it makes no difference because in Ephron's capable hands, this story works, and it works beautifully.  There's a line in the movie, in fact, that kind of sums it all up:  Becky (played by Rosie O'Donnell) says something to the effect to Annie that, `You don't want love, you want `movie' love.  And maybe that's why this movie is so endearing and enduring; it's about the kind of love you find in a perfect world, the kind of love everybody wants and needs (though few will admit it, even to themselves) but rarely finds, and Ephron knows exactly how to make it connect with her audience.  It has to do with understanding basic human needs and knowing how to translate it all into a cinematic art form that will effectively reach those who see it. And Nora Ephron does it as well-- or possibly better-- than any director before or since, and as she proved later with `You've Got Mail,' this film was no fluke; she knows her stuff, and she knows how to deliver it.  It's intentionally and shamelessly sentimental, but rather than maudlin, Ephron hits just the right emotional tone, and it's perfect, from the romance to the humor she injects at just the right moment to offset the drama, to the music-- using just the right song at just the right time-- that does so much to enhance the story.   	Having a great cast, of course, certainly helped her in her endeavor, beginning with Tom Hanks who, with his portrayal of Sam, demonstrates once again what a consummate actor he is.  Few actors can step into any given genre of film and create a character that is so complete and believable every time out the way Hanks can.  Some of his characters may share some traits and have similarities, but he manages to make each one unique, which is quite a feat.  When you can watch Hanks and forget that you're watching `Hanks,' you know he's accomplished something.  As an actor he is remarkably giving, and so undaunted when it comes to using and exposing what he has inside.  And his ability to circumvent any natural inhibitions makes him great at what he does, and it's what makes a character like Sam so memorable.	Meg Ryan, as well, is an accomplished actor who can play drama as well as comedy (check out her performance in `When A Man Loves A Woman'), but she really sparkles in romantic comedies like this one, and she is absolutely perfect for the role of Annie (just as she was for her role in `You've Got Mail').  She makes Annie a very real person, and through her we can empathize with Sam's situation, as she enables and allows the audience to experience what she is feeling right along with her.  Ryan, through her character, makes that emotional involvement possible, and it's one of the strengths of the film.  And like Hanks with Sam, Ryan makes Annie a character you're going to remember.	The exemplary supporting cast includes Bill Pullman (Walter), Rita Wilson (Suzy), Victor Gerber (Greg), Tom Riis Farrell (Rob), David Hyde Pierce (Dennis), Dana Ivey (Claire), Gaby Hoffman (Jessica) and Rob Reiner (Jay). Essentially a poignant and heart-felt treatise by Nora Ephron on life and love, `Sleepless In Seattle' is a film that offers a multitude of rewards if you are simply willing to reach out and open yourself up to it.  All you have to do is let it in.  Do it, and you'll be glad you did, guaranteed. It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",Sleepless in Seattle
60,Stampsfightclub,Unrealistic but enjoyable romantic drama,8,28 August 2008,"Tom Hanks (Big) stars as Sam, a single parent. A year after losing his wife, he is struggling with the loss and to help him, his son Jonah phones a radio station to ask for advice, and Annie from Baltimore hears and knows she must meet up with Sam.Filled with plenty of romantic conventions, Nora Ephron's 1993 romantic drama creates a light hearted feel good film, with funny and dramatic moments for viewers of all ages.Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (When Harry met Sally), in their first collaboration, are perfect in their respective role, especially Ryan who is very funny, where as Hanks takes the more serious roles, which he is always perfect at.But the actor who steals the show is Ross Maligner, who is exceptional as Sam's son Jonah, a cheeky 8 year old kid who has plenty on his mind, and a temper and encouragement to match. His smart remarks about Victoria are pure genius, helped along by some classic facial expressions to make him the star of the film.Though completely unrealistic, this romantic drama generates a healthy plot with the ideology about finding the right person, which is enough to keep the mood alive. The difficulty in the character's lives is good to generate the concept of the right person, with Sam and his lost wife, and Annie and her bizarre fiancé.The lack of realism happens with a cheesy saying the same words, meeting at the same time, or just in time, an 8 year old girl hacking into a computer and an 8 year old kid getting on a plane all the way to New York.The lack of realism can take the edge of the plot, depending on how you look at it. For me, the humour and the likability of the characters was enough to let it slip.It is a very character driven film, helped along by the concept of finding the right person, to make an enjoyable and funny romantic drama.",Sleepless in Seattle
61,TOMASBBloodhound,Awwwwww! Isn't that sweet????,5,7 October 2008,"Knowing full well that I am certainly not the target audience for such a film, I am still compelled to comment on it since it is on TV constantly. I swear that you can always find either this film or The American President on at least one of the basic cable channels at any given time! The film was a huge hit for all involved, and this is a fact that may be a bit troubling.The film deals with Tom Hanks who has just lost his wife moving to Seattle with his young son to start a new life. Why Seattle? Well, this film was made in the early 1990s. Seatte was the trendy place to be back then with its grunge music, coffee houses, flannel shirts and computer companies. Why Hanks & son even move into a trendy kind of hybrid house/boat that they likely would not have been able to afford unless his wife had a nice insurance policy. At least (as far as I recall) the film spares us with the typical Seattle scene of someone throwing fish to another person at that famous outdoor market. Who knows, maybe they threw a shot of this in there. I don't know if I've ever seen this film completely from start to finish.Anyway, Hanks's son really wants a new mommy for himself and a new wife for his daddy. So he calls up one of those boring national shrink radio shows that nearly sunk AM radio back then before the conservative radio revolution saved it. The kid basically tells his plight to the whole country, and Meg Ryan hears him while driving. She is instantly touched by the kid's plea, and sets out to learn as much as she can about Hanks and the kid with the help of computers, private eyes, you name it. Of course the trouble is, Ryan is already engaged to another man. And this man (Bill Pullman) is one of many annoyingly stereotypical supporting characters. He is written as a meek, and boring individual who suffers from some very exaggerated allergy symptoms which are supposed to be funny. As one who has suffered with allergies of his own, I must inform you dear reader that there is nothing funny about these conditions. Will Meg and Tom end up together???? I wonder.The ridiculous scenes and annoying characters are many in number. The kid who plays Hanks's boy is really annoying. So is his little girlfriend. For a while, Hanks dates a woman whose only character trait of note is that she laughs like a hyena. Other than that, she really doesn't seem that bad, but of course the kid hates her. Oh, and Rosie O'Donnell is in the film. Enough said on that issue. The film isn't a complete loss. Of course most women will love it, and the acting by Hanks and Ryan is pretty good. Ryan was still a hottie back then, before some very cruel plastic surgeon turned her face into something resembling The Joker.Overall, this just isn't my kind of thing. Remember I'm the guy who recently gave 10 stars to Revenge of the Ninja! For those of you whose hearts flutter as Jimmy Durante takes you out into the credits, picture this scenario.... Maybe Hanks, Ryan and the boy go out for a bite to eat after their rooftop rendezvous. And after an hour or so of talking, they decide they really don't like each other that much. Something to ponder...... 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Sleepless in Seattle

One day last April (during the total lockdown) I had finally the occasion of watching it and I think it's as good as they all say.When the film begins it shows Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks)'s wife's funeral and he decides to move with his eight-year-old son Jonah in Seattle living on a houseboat as Chicago gives him sad memories about his wife. One evening Jonah hears about a radio program that helps people finding her true love and he decides to participate because he thinks his father needs a new woman in his life. This becomes quite a national case as journalist Annie Reed (Meg Ryan) gets involved. After a while lots of love letters arrive to Sam and Jonah picks as the first one Annie's. Sam and Annie manage to meet for the first time on the top of the Empire State Building in New York on St. Valentine's Day, just like in AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER.This is among the classics of rom com movies because of its story that is quite original and also for the likeability of the characters. Tom Hanks gives one of his best performances of that period, and I think that 1993 was among his best years as he also did PHILADELPHIA (the first movie for which he won the Academy Award). Meg Ryan shines in her most known genre and Rosie O'Donnell (as Ryan's best friend), Bill Pullman and Rita Wilson (Hanks' real life wife) give great supporting performances.A well directed rom com, with an intelligent and thoughtful script and with an endearing child actor. I'll recommend it not only to rom com fans as it's one of those movies that can be loved independently from the genre.",Sleepless in Seattle

What we have here is a very cute film with great stars and wonderful acting. Tom Hanks (Sam), Meg Ryan (Annie) and Ross Malinger (Jonah) all put in wonderful performances. This is without a doubt a ""chick flick"" but guys can enjoy it, too. It's funny and very touching, but not a tearjerker as many films of this genre have been. The characters are very, very human and that increases the intensity of the story. Bill Pullman also does very well in the film as the jilted fiancee.

66,AhmedSpielberg99,"That's your problem. You don't wanna be in love, you wanna be in love in a movie.",7,3 June 2021,"Rummaging through the movies that really helped me at my lowest points, You've Got Mail was the first one that came to mind. So instead of giving it a rewatch (I do hate it when movies don't live up to my first viewing of them), I thought it was a sign I should finally get around to the other Hanks/Ryan Nora Ephron film. Again, this one proves how exceptionally good Ephron was at balancing out the gooeyness of her far-fetched romantic stories with some sincere dialogue that grounds a story about a star-crossed lovers in reality. The premise of two people who have never met and live on opposite ends of the country become infatuated with each other seems destined to leave viewers incredulous. But at its core, it's a story about a man (Sam) overcoming grief after losing his wife, instantly thawing the cynicism of a woman (Annie) once she hears on a radio about his ""magical"" love story he once had. Consequently, Annie goes to great lengths to meet Sam while grappling with the idea of leaving her strait-laced fiancé in the process for fear of leading more of a satisfactory life rather than a genuine one. That's why Annie's storyline proved more interesting to me, and Meg Ryan did an amazing job at expressing this kind of a dilemma Annie goes through from the moment she's crying while listening to the radio to the very end. She managed to express a myriad of troubling emotions that can only be inferred because of the lighthearted nature of the film. The chemistry between her and Hanks is once again undeniable despite, sadly, sharing very few scenes together. Crammed with humorous cynicism and self-awareness, Sleepless in Seattle also elicits more than its fair share of chuckles, whether coming from its endless movie references (with An Affair to Remember being at the top of them) or Hanks's sweet interactions with his on-screen son. Definitely not near as tightly-scripted as You've Got Mail, as its plot sometimes may feel like is stretched-out to death. Plus, despite being perfectly paired with some scenes, the soundtrack is full of on-the-nose choices. Nevertheless, Sleepless in Seattle is just the mood-booster I wanted right now.",Sleepless in Seattle

70,khatcher-2,Where sheep may safely graze......,2,13 October 2002,"Boasting the title of `Film of the Week' on our state first channel (RTVE), and there being nothing else digestible on to keep anything or anybody awake and interested (football on the second channel, one of those ghastly talk-in shows with public participation on the third channel, whatever on the fourth which is by monthly subscription, and one of those identical to all the others tough cops series on the fifth, not to mention a grisly US child murderer thriller series on the regional channel), anything with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan seemed to be preferable; as well as the fact that it might appeal to my wife at least, and I could meanwhile get on with arranging the holiday snaps and sticking them in the albums.As it happens, I got most of the photos into place, staring at me from those sticky pages with that light transparent covering over them (hell of a job getting the wrinkles out), and my wife went to sleep: her snoring upset the fragments of a few songs which were worth trying to hear through all the racket (snores and film background noise), one of which was either Brenda Lee or a jolly good interpretation of her by Celine Dion.As for anything else, this film ranks at the level of other similar trivial banalities (or banal trivialities if you prefer) such as `Pretty Woman', `Notting Hill', `You've got Mail' - also with Meg and Tom - and others of the genre - or ilk.About two thirds through the soap, I could not have given a brass farthing whether Meg met Tom and made him fall in love with her or not.
The whole matter was so ephimeral, so cliched, so programmed for all the dear souls who get a lump in their throat at the slightest behest, so geared to enthrall obliviously vacant minds, so mass-prepared to cover box-office receipts in glory and greenbacks, so evidently aimed at all those goggle-eyed in comfy urban centrally-heated homes in down-town Detroit or uptown Duluth, so replete with sigh-jerking assumed feelings that jump about at the commands of a remote, so utterly adorned in swaddling-clothed piffle, so completely beyond me why such drivel just has to be composed into wasting thousands of metres of Ektachrome, such that I do not understand how so many people can throw away so many dollars and ?uros paying to watch 105 minutes of painful tripe (without onions).The brainless may rejoice; but while Hollywood (=US) continues spilling out endless mindlessness, no way can the world of cinema be considered the Seventh Art.Caramba!

It is like the modern day love story.The story of a family of two, a son and his widow father who never let go of his memory of his wife. The son was upset with his father so he called the radio station talk show in hope of finding him a new wife.Even though the movie is not that old, you will feel like the movie in the 80s'. Anyway the movie does offer something new to the love story, but in my opinion there nothing much happen in the movie and some of the things are working out too perfectly.Recommendation: It Ain't That Bad, But I Think ""You've Got Mail"" Is Better.Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C+)",Sleepless in Seattle

The film also has a bit of sadness in its early part, thankfully not overdone. The five lead characters and the performances by their actors (Hanks, Ryan, Malinger, Pullman and O'Donnell) are all engaging. The primary members of the support cast are also excellent (David Pierce, Annie's brother; Garber and Wilson as Sam's brother-in-law and sister; Reiner as his colleague/friend; young Gaby Hoffman; and Barbara Garrick as Sam's brief girlfriend). The story, juxtaposed with the classic Grant/Kerr predecessor, could have provided an excessive gimmick, but here it worked well. And I was grateful for some things I didn't find in this flick. Although I watched the program like everyone else, I found Rob Reiner's character, acting and presence in ""All in the Family"" to be obnoxious and annoying, ALL THE TIME, and watched the program in spite of his presence. And I have found Rosie O'Donnell's presence to be the epitomé of ANNOYING in every respect, every time I've observed her, previously. But in this film, I enjoyed both of their performances completely. Children in movies can also be an irritating presence, but Malinger and Hoffman were delightful as son Jonah, and his little neighbor/friend. Barbara Garrick, with a supporting role here (as in ""The Firm"") is an appealing actress, for whom one would wish more prominent roles. Tom Hanks is one of the foremost actors of our time, but even he can go a smidgen too far in a characterization (I thought he did so in both ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Philadelphia""). But he certainly didn't here. Watch, enjoy, and feel good.",Sleepless in Seattle

It's not bad, just sort-of slow paced and why should I care about these characters? The ending is all too predictable, as is the entire film. The acting was good.Who should see this film:-- anybody crazy about ""You've Got Mail"" who wants the 'prequel'-- romantic comedy people with nothing better to do on a rainy dayAction guys like me, get your SO to choose something else, how about Enemy in the Gate which has some great romance but (ssh!) is really an action flick.I'll give ""Sleepless in Seattle"" a so-so 6 out of 10.",Sleepless in Seattle

Introduction to two protagonists lasts about 45 minutes: their family, their work, where they are in their relationship, and so on. Gosh, it goes on and on and on and on. Some information is never related back to anything happening in the movie. Sam and Annie finally meet in person for brief seconds at the last half of the movie, meaning there is no time for building chemistry at all. By the way, 'Sleepless in Seattle' is not the love story between Sam and Annie because Sam's opinion of who he loves really does not matter because the film is all about Jonah, Sam's son, finding his best choice for his step mother. All stages of plot development depend on the coincidence. Annie accidently listens to radio, falls in love just by listening Sam's story, stalks this single dad by flying all the way to Seattle from Baltimore, and believes that heart shaped lightings in ESB is a signal to dump her fiancé and to run to the stranger. I mean, come ON!! His fiancé even encourages her to go to meet that stranger, giving up their long term relationship without any remorse. Sam who was reluctant to go into any relationship regardless of support and convincing from his family and friends, falls in love with Annie at first sight even though he is dating Victoria.

76,roghache,Really fun 'feel good' modern romantic comedy,8,15 March 2006,"Admittedly a chick flick, but if you're a remote fan of the romantic comedy genre, this one's a real winner. Apparently, its story is based on the old 1957 classic, An Affair to Remember (starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr), which I confess to not having seen.The story revolves around a recent Seattle widower named Sam, whose son Jonah, seeing his dad's loneliness, advertises via talk show radio for a new wife for him (and mother for himself). Sam receives lots of letters in reply, including one from a certain Annie in Baltimore, despite the fact that she's already engaged to that strange character, Walter. Annie is so attracted and intrigued that she in fact travels to Seattle to check Sam (and his son) out, and so on... and so forth... culminating in a real humdinger of a finale involving NYC's Empire State Building.The lead roles are done to perfection with Tom Hanks (always so natural in every film) portraying the sympathetic, lonely widower, Sam, and Meg Ryan (queen of the romantic comedy) sparkling as the sweet, innocent, and wholesome Annie. I love both these stars anyway and they have great chemistry here. Okay, maybe it's not rocket science, maybe it's corny and unlikely, but it's a really cute movie. Get into your jamies, girls, make some popcorn, and enjoy. By the way, the guys just might like it, too. My own husband really did.",Sleepless in Seattle

I also miss the American wholesome entertainers of the 1990s that you could snuggle up and watch with the whole family--especially the Disney hits.Nostalgia apart, most of the movie is cute and heartwarming. However, I don't like how Annie ditches her fiancé (that too on Valentine's Day) for a guy she's just heard on the radio (and randomly saw in the middle of the street on the opposite end of the country for a few seconds). She doesn't know him at all. What if he had some freaky past? What if he doesn't like her? What if he is not there at all? Why break a perfectly good relationship with a person who truly loves you for some so-called ""magic"" that may just be a part of your imagination?

The chief obstacles to fruition of the adults' feelings are: i) logistical (one is in Seattle, the other in Baltimore), ii) the woman's inability to break off a relationship to another that she fears may not be fulfilling, and iii) the fact that the child is really the woman's only contact on the man's side - in fact, it is only the father's confession of woe on national radio that woos the woman.There are many humorous one liner sorts of remarks - good supporting characters, and a wonderful last scene.Yet I must admit on seeing this yet again (my third or fourth time? First time was definitely on a date in the theater) that much of the movie is logistics -How will the woman discover the radio man's identity? How will she communicate with him? How will the son reply? On what pretext will the engaged woman go to Seattle? How will the woman go to New York? Why and how will the man get to New York? How and when will the woman break off her engagement to be married to a man who had the defect of many allergies (always fatal in movie romances)?

80,lyubitelfilmov,Love in the distance or a good romantic story,7,6 February 2021,"Melodrama. A picture that I stumbled upon on the recommendation of a good person who praised it. And although I burned myself a couple of times on this, this case was a happy exception, because I liked the picture, so I could not keep my emotions to myself and decided to share with you, and here is my short opinion - Love at a distance. Surprisingly, there is literally nothing to complain about in the picture, so allow your humble servant to focus your attention on the merits of this melodrama.
So, here they are:
1. The story told - a boy calls a program that is broadcast on the radio about his Christmas dream - to find a mother and a wife for his father, since both have lost their beloved recently. The father is sad and does not find a place for himself, even moves with his son from Chicago to Seattle, which is on the other side of the country. Annie hears this story - an unmarried lady, although she is ready to soon become a bride. She is unable to contain her emotions, and soon writes him a letter. This becomes the beginning of a series of events that will lead the heroes to the famous ending. It should be said that no logical holes or outright nonsense were found in this story. The heroes of both the first and second plan are well written and behave like ordinary people with their strengths and weaknesses. Well, the main characters evoke sympathy, although not from the first minutes, but they do. The script does not mark time and does not stretch the timing to obscurity. All scenes are needed and carry the necessary information. It's just that we have a good and high-quality melodrama, albeit with a small admixture of comedy. If you love this genre, then this picture will definitely interest you.
2. Environment - America in the early nineties, with bubble monitors, endless hustle and bustle, telephones on the wire and more. How long ago it was, and now it seems that in antediluvian times. Do you still remember pay phones on the street and in public places? I happened to find it. Oh nostalgia. Sorry, I'm grumbling like an old grandfather again. We can say that this picture is evidence of a historical era, and even with a good romantic history.
3. Humor - this picture is not a comedy, but a melodrama, since there are quite a few jokes and funny situations in it. But they are made and delivered well and elicit exactly the right reaction. At one joke (it turned out to be not even a script joke, but an actor's improvisation), I laughed out loud, because here the actors really did their best. Well, funny situations are simply pleasing to the eye.
4. Emotions - the picture is emotional, and it is difficult to argue with that. At first, she does not seem like that, but as the characters of the characters unfold and the development of events, the viewer becomes attached to her. The heroes do not grimace or play out, they behave as ordinary people would behave in a similar situation. Well, the finale deserves special attention.
5. The finale is predictable, but effective and emotional, making the viewer feel joy for the heroes and cry tears of joy. It is well furnished. The actors did their best, and this can be seen with the naked eye. Maybe until the middle the picture was not so emotional, but the ending beats everything off! I highly recommend it.
6. Music - perfect for a romantic atmosphere, although apart from the picture I would not listen.
A little about the main characters:
1. Sam Baldwin performed by Tom Hanks is an architect from Chicago who, together with his son, lost his beloved wife and mother, which is why, in order to get rid of depression and bad thoughts, he decided to leave for Seattle. The son's act breathed new life and determined no less the future. Tom is great as always, and his talk about the deceased is something. Bravo Tom!
2. Annie Reed performed by Meg Ryan is a journalist from Baltimore who heard the boy's dream and could not remain indifferent. She was so moved by this story. But before that, she has to sort out her feelings for the groom and decide for herself whether the ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is worth this sacrifice. Meg is adorable, a couple of funny scenes with her amused me a lot. Good Meg!
And the heroes constantly chat about films, which could not fail to please such a moviegoer like me.
The picture is not outdated even for a day, except that the environment has changed, and the soulfulness in modern melodramas is not at all the same as before. This is a melodrama about pure love!
As a result, we have a good melodrama, with a good and thoughtful script, interesting dialogues, good humor, emotionality and a wonderful ending, well, with good acting, especially Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan!
My rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",Sleepless in Seattle

82,kyle-cruse,"Not bad, but not great",7,9 December 2008,"Good romantic comedies are very hard to find. ""Sleepless in Seattle"" was engaging and mildly funny, and it achieved what I like all romance comedies to do: make me wish the two main characters could be together. In this film, Tom Hanks and his son are mourning the death of his wife, and his son calls in on a radio show to find a new wife for his dad. Meg Ryan is listening from far away and starts falling in love with this man who she has never seen. It's a bit far-fetched, but we must remember that it is just a movie or we will never enjoy it. ""Sleepless"" had tons of potential, right up to the end, but did not prove itself to be a great romantic comedy. Tom Hanks' son is too much of a brat to be a lovable character, which takes away from some of the film's enjoyment. Also, without giving away the ending, it doesn't prove to be romantic enough. I was expecting the end to be more touching and satisfying instead of just suddenly ending on the spot like it does. The film is not necessarily all it's hyped up to be. Nevertheless, I won't complain too much. It's enjoyable and will entertain you for the evening. It also has a great soundtrack with singers like Jimmy Durante, Carly Simon, and Harry Connick Jr. I prefer ""You've Got Mail,"" also starring Hanks and Ryan, over this film because it's funnier and more romantic, but this is worth seeing.

Even better, who doesn't like them together?This is a slight variation on the typical love story. The story is really less about the developing love between two people and more about the potential love between two people. It kind of reminds me of the two strangers who happen to be sitting across the aisle from each other on the train. They are attracted to each other. The more they look, the more they like. That process, albeit simplistic, is kind of what this movie is about.They both find out about each other, communicate long distance briefly, become infatuated with each other - and with the help of Hank's son, in a somewhat preposterous manner, find each other - and, presumably, each other's love.My only lasting criticism - and one I can't quite put my finger on - was the very, very end.

And sure enough, I was right. The plot may be ridiculous and the surrounding cast may play second fiddle to the two leads but that doesn't stop this sickly sweet rom-com from feeling like a good, old-fashioned romantic chick-flick. But whereas recent dross like ""27 Dresses"" or ""The Accidental Husband"" struggle to overcome their plot holes (and boy, are there many!), ""Sleepless In Seattle"" feels much classier and you soon forget that what you're watching is complete nonsense.A young-looking Tom Hanks plays Sam, a recently widowed architect who moves with his young son Jonah (Ross Malinger) to Seattle in a desperate bid to overcome his grief. After being duped by his son into talking on national radio about his feelings of despair, he strikes a chord into the hearts of many including Baltimore journalist Annie (Meg Ryan) who becomes obsessed with the caller dubbed ""Sleepless In Seattle"". Trouble is, she is engaged to marry the safe and dependable (read ""boring"") Walter (Bill Pullman). Are her doubts pre-wedding day jitters or a sign that maybe, her true-love lies further afield?It's unusual these days to find a rom-com that actually is romantic or funny so ""Sleepless In Seattle"" is a pleasant surprise by being both. Yes, it's sad as well especially when Hanks goes on about how much he misses his wife. But Hanks also has fun in the role - his banter with Rob Reiner is good for a laugh, as is Ryan's interaction with Rosie O'Donnell and Pullman. And for anyone looking for an old-fashioned sob-fest then they won't be disappointed either as this film piles on the schmultz towards the end, presumably to make you forget how silly the story is. Trouble is, like all romantic films, it is deeply predictable despite the implausibility - ""Notting Hill"" was the same, offering nothing resembling a surprise or twist in any way, shape or form. But in truth, who cares when it is expertly performed, brilliantly scored and wonderfully presented schmultz? ""Sleepless In Seattle"" isn't perfect but it is a hell of a lot better than a fistful of other rom-coms I could rattle off, including its spiritual sequel ""You've Got Mail"". In my experience, women want films that move them, that tug on the heart-strings and play havoc with your tear ducts. ""Sleepless In Seattle"" will do the trick all right but for me personally, I'd liked a bit more plausibility to make this tale of star-crossed lovers more enjoyable. People fall in and out of love everyday in normal circumstances so why does Hollywood feel the need to jazz up a good story even more? Maybe I'm being overly critical because this is a good film and any rom-com fan worthy of the title will watch it anyway. Let me put it this way: my wife went to sleep halfway through (she'd seen it before) but still wants the Blu-Ray for Christmas. Looks like I'm not done watching this just yet...",Sleepless in Seattle
89,danielll_rs,"Light, funny and beautiful romantic comedy",8,23 October 1999,"""Sleepless in Seattle"" is one of my favorite romantic comedies. Maybe my second favorite- the first one is ""Notting Hill"". The story is beautiful, magical and above all romantic- even if there's not a single kiss. Meg Ryan is lovely as she uses to be. I don't care if some people say bad things about her. I have great fun with her films.You can say 'This film is predictable' but so what? It has many great points. For example, it doesn't appeal to sexuality. It is a very funny and light film, with a good sound track.A must-see for everyone. I've watched it three or four times, and I always have fun. 9/10",Sleepless in Seattle
90,troy-manatunga,"Is that even possible? To fall in love with just a voice and a story, never seeing nor knowing who it is?",7,22 January 2012,"A love story between two ends of a continent and a story that is unique during its time, a story of love and chance that would make the female romantics stomachs turn. Certain movies will indeed last a life time. Some maybe as powerful as FORREST GUMP, some can bring to life a tragedy that came upon the unsinkable vessel THE TITANIC, some movies can be considered as the next step in cinematography as THE GLADIATOR and then there are those few whose names remain but the story is forgotten with time such as SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE. However every-time you do push that DVD in your player, it is certain that it will move you and reach out to you just as much as it did the very first time.Tom Hanks who stole your heart away as Forrest and who showed true grit in taking on the solo role of Chuck in CAST AWAY is always remembered fondly by his fans for those magical characters he played. Meg Ryan the Venus of the 90s was probably in every romcom that made a mark back then. SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, YOU'VE GOT MAIL, CITY OF ANGELS & WHEN MAN LOVES a WOMAN is titles that cannot be forgotten if you are indeed a fan of the genre. Ryan and Hanks in one of the very earliest of their performances together scores a near perfect score with SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.It is said that there is no greater gift than the gift of love. Indeed it's true. We all have an emotional connection in our lives to someone that is entirely unexplainable. It's a connection on a platonic level unlike the attraction of lust. This value of love has been misread entirely in Hollywood of today and movies with such innocent intentions are quite rare. SIS by director Norah Ephron holds onto the idea of platonic love. It in-fact personifies the mere idea of such platonic connections between two people. Norah Ephron who has a knack for movies of this category certainly takes her work to heart. It is indeed evident primarily with her preference on always casting Meg Ryan. Next it's the very seasonal touch (most movies are set during the holiday season) she adds onto them and then the medium she uses to bring her lovers together. Two individuals who have never seen nor heard of each other falls in love over a radio show and in another instance rivals in business who falls in love in a chat room. With due credit to the writers who conjured the scripts; BRAVO! Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks) and his 8 year old son Jonah Baldwin (Ross Malinger) are hit by surprise when their wife/mother Maggie is suddenly passes away. Devastated by the loss of his wife Sam and son Jonah leaves Chicago and moves all the way to Seattle with the hopes of moving on and beginning a new life. 18 months down the line Sam is still mourning the loss of Maggie and is unable to function an inch beyond her memories. Young Jonah who is smart for his age understands his fathers' grief and wishes only to see him happy. On Christmas eve Jonah calls in on a radio talk show and explains to the host his fathers' situation and subsequently Sam ends up on the phone pouring his heart out over the air of his love for Maggie. Sam is heard all over country to those who are tuned in, Including Annie (Meg Ryan) who is driving over to her fiancés parents' home for Christmas Eve dinner. Annie who unconsciously forms a liking towards Sam over the days lose focus on Walter (Bill Pullman); her fiancé and is totally hung up on a stranger she has never met nor seen all her life. Is that even possible? To fall in love with just a voice and a story, never seeing nor knowing who it is?Title: SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE Directed by: Norah Ephron Starring: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Bill Pullman and Ross Maligner Rated: PG for some language Rating: 7.5/10 105 Minutes",Sleepless in Seattle

92,neenahhh,A different love story,3,19 February 2011,"'When Harry Met Sally' is on the top of my romantic comedies, so I was really excited when I saw that this movie was produced by the same people who made my favorite rom-com of all time! I've heard about this movie ever since I was a young girl. I thought it was about two people staying up all night, talking and doing what-not in Seattle, hence the title. Boy, was I wrong.This was a cute romantic movie. It's not like your typical, LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, bam!-kinda movies. (SPOILERS) In fact, the main characters don't even officially meet throughout most of the movie's duration! (/SPOILERS) I guess that was the theme of the movie. It shows how love is blind.(SPOILERS) One thing I didn't like was how Annie dropped a stable relationship to risk having a relationship with someone she didn't even know. (/SPOILERS) That's my only complaint. I myself like security and stability, so that part didn't really jive with me.Jonah's a cute kid, really caring about his father's happiness. Sam and Jonah's relationship is an example of a great father-son relationship that we don't get to see on screen too often. They're both very open and very warm with each other. It was very nice to watch.If you liked 'When Harry Met Sally', be sure to watch this. They're somewhat on the same level even though, I personally liked the first one better.",Sleepless in Seattle
93,SofiaHedge,Nicely Done,8,13 September 2020,Sleepless in Seattle is pleasing to watch. The plot is interesting. It's so cool how you can sense your soulmate without truly knowing who it is. The dialogue and acting are both great. I highly recommend this.,Sleepless in Seattle
94,clydestuff,One of the best romantic comedies ever to come along,10,29 July 2003,"Early Plot points of the movieA lot of people who have viewed Sleepless In Seattle, see it as nothing more than a chick flick, a date movie, or just a plain old predictable romantic comedy.  It is so much more than that.  It is a superbly acted, wonderfully written, flawlessly directed tribute to all romantic films.  Nora Ephron, put it this way when she said, ""This is not a film about romance, this is a film about romance in the movies"", and during Sleepless we are given many references to An Affair to Remember to illustrate just that.The film opens in Chicago with Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks) and his son Jonah, at the funeral of Sam's wife Maggie.  We do not see them close up, but we get a voice over by Sam, trying to explain to Jonah why these things happen.  The film then cuts directly to Sam, who is an architect, at work, being given a card for a support group by a co-worker.  Sam, removes several similar cards from his pocket, and as he throws them to the table reading them, we sense his frustration that although people are trying to be helpful, there is no way they can possibly understand what his life is now like without Maggie. It is here that he decides to take Jonah away from Chicago and move to Seattle.  If these opening scenes had been played with too much pathos, then the whole concept of the film could have been lost.  Tom Hanks, does these scenes with perfection, setting just the right tone to enable us to understand his loss but not become so lost in it that the whole film sinks.We then move forward a year to Christmas Eve.  Annie Reed (Meg Ryan) is going with her fiance Walter (Bill Pullman) to her parent's home to announce their engagement.  Though it appears to be the perfect relationship, there are little signs given throughout these opening moments that lets the audience know what Annie doesn't. Perhaps this isn't such a perfect match, and Annie has convinced herself that it is.  Later, Annie is driving her car alone, down the highway to join Walter in Baltimore.  It is here that she tunes her radio to one of those programs where people call in to get advice, in this case a Dr. Marcia.  Coincidentally, (where would most films be without that word!), Jonah has called Dr. Marcia to ask advice about Sam, as it seems Jonah senses that Sam's depressed and is unable to sleep.  Dr. Marcia convinces Jonah to put Sam on the phone.  It is in this sequence, that Meg Ryan shines.  Acting and reacting to something you hear on the radio is one thing, but as Annie, Meg Ryan is required to do it for a good length of time.  When she is listening to Sam's voice, telling why he loved his wife so much, we believe her reaction, and we understand it.  These scenes were perhaps the most crucial part of the film.  If we don't believe Annie at this point, then we won't believe any of the actions that she takes afterward.  From this point on, we are left to wonder if these two people who seem to be made for each other will ever meet.  Of course, you probably know that going in, but this film gets us there with a keen sense of humor, terrific characters, and a story not only about fate, but whether falling in love with someone you never met is possible.Rosie O'Donnell is perfectly cast as Meg's friend Becky, and delivers her lines in such a matter-of-fact tone that lines like ""A movie! That's your problem! You don't want to be in love. You want to be in love in a movie"" prove to be even funnier.  Bill Pullman, as Walter, is required to overplay his part, so that we know he isn't the right match for Annie.  He does it well, just enough to let us in on the mismatch, but not annoying to the point where we dislike him.  He is a good guy, and as Annie says to him later, ""deserves better than me"".  Ross Malinger as Jonah also does well, never being overly sweet, or too obnoxious.  He makes us believe in his relationship with Sam, and that he really wants his father to be happy again.  Gaby Hoffman, as Jonah's friend Jessica, is priceless in her few scenes with him.  Rob Reiner as Jay, giving advice to Sam on dating in the eighties, has one of his best supporting roles ever.  His scenes alone are worth taking time to  watch Sleepless.Nora Ephron deserves high praise for having given us this romantic-comedy gem.  It has all the ingredients one could ask for from beginning to end. As Sam and Annie might say, ""It has magic"".",Sleepless in Seattle
95,Qanqor,Pretty good romance,7,27 June 2008,"What can I tell you? This is pretty much a chick-flick, and I'm a guy, but I'm sorry, I rather liked it. Not profound or amazing or anything really all that special, just a well-done romance, where you really are pulling for the two to get together (despite realizing that, obviously, they're going to), and enjoy it when they finally do.There were two things in particular that I liked about it. One, they made the effort to try to establish some reasons to think these two actually belong together, as opposed to the more typical Hollywood deal of, well, they're right for each other because we say so, and here's the sentimental violin music to prove it.The other thing I liked is that the Walter character, the fiancé who's doomed to ultimately be the loser in this game of romance, is actually made out to be a half-decent guy. He's not made out to be an obvious putz that we know is all wrong for the woman, which would be the usual Hollywood thing to do (i.e. ""His Girl Friday"" or ""The Philadelphia Story"" (don't get me wrong, *great* movies, but you see my point)). Yeah, the whole excessive allergy thing is rather loserish, but other than that, he seems like a perfectly fine guy, who treats her well and really would try hard to make her happy, and in general she really does seem to respond to him and, at least on some level, be in love with him. Look at how happy she is, for instance, to get his valentine card. This all works very well, because it really does introduce a feeling of doubt in our minds... is she really going to leave him? I thought that was a very nice touch.So in the end, I enjoyed it.Although I'm left wondering at the end... they *still* haven't solved the problem that it's ""like 26 states"" between Seattle and Baltimore (as someone in a very-long-distance relationship, I can report first-hand that that kind of problem can be *very* hard to solve, true love or not),",Sleepless in Seattle
96,Travis_Bickle01,Average romantic comedy,6,26 July 2005,"I think everyone knows the story: a kid calls to a radio station, his mother died a year and a half before and his father just can't get over her death. He's looking for a new wife for his father, a new mother for him. The leads are for Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan and Bill Pullman; directed by Nora Ephron who also was co-writer for ""When Harry Met Sally"".This was the second and probably also last time I saw ""Sleepless in Seattle"". I saw it the first time about 8 years ago, when I was still a kid. I liked the movie then. After re-watching it now, I was somewhat disappointed. I think they should have made it less comedy and more drama. The acting was good, but I'm more the drama kind of guy. If they would have made something more serious, I would have loved it more.So in the end, is it worth watching. Yes, absolutely. Although, the movie doesn't deserves it, it's seen as a classic in his genre and it was a real blockbuster as well. Nice performances but not one of my favourites.6,5/10",Sleepless in Seattle

98,daviddaphneredding,Such wonderful comedy/romance movies are rare anymore,8,11 December 2012,"This very entertaining movie is a present-day rarity, for seldom if ever do you find movies concerning a story where a strong void is filled in a person's life, and concomitantly you don't find far-fetched ways to do it. First of all, Sam Baldwin has just lost his wife in Chicago, and the depressed man wants to get away from it all and move to Seattle where he is definitely sleepless because of his recent loss, naturally. At the same time, his eight-year-old son Jonah wants a new mother. Meanwhile, in Baltimore the very attractive Annie Reed, after a dinner at her parent's home where she introduces her future husband to her family, is driving away when she listens to a talk-show hosted by Dr. Marcia Fieldstone who talks to Sam, whom she calls ""Sleepless in Seattle"". While listening to his voice Annie suddenly becomes taken with him, and then pursues him, thanks very much to the Internet. This is when the ""fun"" begins. She ""seeks advice"" from the classic Cary Grant-Deborah Kerr movie ""An Affair to Remember"", which she watches on t.v. very often. The story does have a warm and happy ending. The story has different settings-Chicago, New York, Baltimore, as well as Seattle. The very versatile Tom Hanks does his turn well, and the unusually appealing Meg Ryan captivated my attention in her role as Annie Reed. Ross Mallinger does acting well for a very young boy. Rosie O'Donnell is her nutty self as Annie's very close friend. Nora Ephron did a good job of writing and directing.

102,Calysta,Brilliant tear jerker,9,22 January 2000,"Sugary? Quite. Unrealistic? Perhaps, to a certain degree. Pristine in a time of over budgeted action flicks? This is certainly a feel good movie that we all still need. It has hope. It doesn't have a cynical outlook on life. Therefore, there's still hope for Hollywood. Not to churn out endless romantic comedies, but to make something they are having continual trivial complexes at trying to make. GOOD entertainment. To put the ""Sleepless in Seattle"" theory to the test, two years ago one of Sydney's prominent radio stations tried it out. People would speak to others over the phone, but would never see them. Lie detectors and psychics and other mad people were used to put together the couple best suited. Then the lavish wedding, the honey moon, and then the afterwards.
The magic fell apart, months later. Oh dear. Maybe this is one situation where reel life is better than real life. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are both great in their roles of star matched lovers, and with the exception of a partially disturbing Rosie O'Donnell, the rest of the supporting cast matches up. I understand where the allegations of just another 'chick flick' but it certainly is a good 90s morale booster. It has all the right touches, light romance, light humour, light accompanying soundtrack and no over domineering actors. The whole thing fits together like a jigsaw puzzle.
Despite how much I applaud the movie, Hanks and Ryan are no Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. ""An Affair to Remember"" references are the part basis of the movie, but it certainly enhances the whole thing. See it again. It's completely worth it. Rating: 9/10",Sleepless in Seattle

(Movies don't need sentiment or a happy ending, and can have unsettling elements of plot and get higher ratings from me).
The movie is soap-opera material, but at least it moves quickly enough. It poses no questions and answers none beyond the question, ""can people love others despite distance?"" Sure. So what?

113,benm-41751,A strange but touching romantic comedy,7,25 February 2019,"Sleepless in Seattle is an unexpectedly strange romantic comedy.In a way, it does everything about romcoms in reverse. These movies tend to have you laughing through the movie then crying at the end. This one starts with the more visceral, emotional parts, which in a way makes it more satisfying to laugh throughout - especially, perhaps, if you are dealing with the fallout of a lost loved on the way Sam is and you're trying to see the humor in life.It becomes a greater caricature of itself as it goes on. For no logical reason, Annie becomes obsessed with Sam after having heard him confess his loneliness and mourning on the radio, and Sam's son becomes convinced that she must meet him after reading her letter. Despite both of the leads having what seem to be decent relationships going, they both are tugged away by ""fate"" and their prying loved ones.Near the end of the movie, the two have still never met properly. They've only had a couple of strange encounters where they didn't work up the courage to say anything. Sam comes to New York to chase his son who has somehow gotten there himself, while Annie leaves her husband in a surprisingly mellow scene. This is one of the moments where the movie could lose some people, because we have to give up a bit on sense.At the very last moment of the film, they manage to run into each other at the top of the Empire State building. Not much is said, but there seems to be an understanding that they will leave together. Rather than finding myself in tears, I found myself a bit puzzled - but also smiling.I think what makes this movie such a romcom ""classic"" is that it's truly all about the firm belief we hold that there is someone out there for us, and that we will know when we find it. And rather than having the disbelieving couple deny it for a while before going through the motions of developing their perfect relationship, all we actually know is that the two are peeled away from the lives they've come to accept - lives that weren't even so bad - and come together on the notion that it might be meant to be. And in one way it's about our deepest instincts for what's right, the gravitation we have towards people like ourselves, and in another way it's about the enduring hope we keep beyond all our better senses.Sleepless in Seattle has become a classic because it has some truly touching and funny moments, but also because it very brazenly capitalizes on our guilty pleasure beliefs about love and fate. And unlike most romcoms, it doesn't expect us to believe it has really happened - it just expects us to believe that the characters believe it, which they do!",Sleepless in Seattle

118,faterson,"A Chicks' Movie Indeed: Superstitious & Maudlin, But Also Witty, Pleasant & Ultimately Moving",7,28 June 2012,"It's difficult to enjoy a movie that you feel is built on a premise that is fundamentally false. I was, therefore, only able to enjoy _Sleepless in Seattle_ while gnashing my teeth quite frequently._Sleepless in Seattle_ is about as subtle as a sledgehammer in driving home its message: that there exist phenomena such as ""soul mate"", ""being destined for each other"", ""true love at first sight"", etc. Its conception of ""love"" is extremely old-fashioned; it's supposed to be that thing where ""one meets one"", and ""you are my everything"", ""you're the world to me"". It's strange, but somehow you instantly feel that _Sleepless in Seattle_ is an irreligious movie; it's not that it would be *against religion*, but you get the definite feeling right from the start that ""love"" in its religious dimension is and will remain conspicuously absent from the movie. This is all the more remarkable in that _Sleepless in Seattle_ glorifies and uses motives from the 1957 Cary Grant & Deborah Kerr hit, _An Affair to Remember_ -- a romantic comedy as well, but where religion and religious feelings are as obviously present as they are non-existent in _Sleepless in Seattle_.I believe in none of those things such as ""destiny"", ""soul mates"", ""being made for one another"", ""you're the only one"", etc. And I'm sorry, but as the movie kept reiterating these motives ad nauseam (especially in many of the intentionally old-fashioned songs -- both original and ""fake"" new ones written in the old vein, frequently featuring awful, annoyingly maudlin lyrics -- that we get to listen to throughout the movie, from the opening to the closing credits), I just *had* to say to myself: ""All this 'destingy stuff' is something typically enjoyed and believed by women."" There's nothing wrong with a movie or book that makes it obvious that its author is a woman; however, this seemed to be *too* obvious in _Sleepless in Seattle_, detracting from the overall enjoyment. I was saying to myself, ""This is a chicks' movie,"" long before Tom Hanks said the same thing about _An Affair to Remember_; but it's a verdict that is even more apropos in relation to _Sleepless in Seattle_.Speaking of the comparison to _An Affair to Remember_, it's weird that _Sleepless in Seattle_ seems more archaic than the movie that preceded it by almost 3 decades. Both movies feature wildly improbable, unrealistic story-lines; yet when you come to think of it, Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr might meet on a luxury ship in 2012 just as they did back in 1957; it would no longer be a transatlantic voyage today, but a pleasurable cruise. Could, however, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan interact, today, in the same way as shown in _Sleepless in Seattle_? Nope. This movie fairly screams at you: ""Where's the Internet? Where are the mobile phones, emails, and social networks?"" Only a few years later, and the movie's plot would be rendered unusable. Even as it is, great effort is required to suspend your disbelief; while _An Affair to Remember_ is unrealistic, _Sleepless in Seattle_ is doubly so. Or can anyone honestly believe that a loving father would not have alerted the police immediately upon learning that his 8-year-old son eloped on a transcontinental flight to New York unsupervised? Despite all these shortcomings, _Sleepless in Seattle_ manages to be enjoyable throughout, and unlike _An Affair to Remember_, I believe this movie gets better and better with every passing minute. I found the ending of _An Affair to Remember_ rather a let-down, but not here; I thought the Empire State Building finale of _Sleepless in Seattle_ was very nicely constructed, and genuinely moving.I'd say the main credit for the movie's success should go to the two leading stars. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan both give brilliant, flawless performances. They seem thoroughly believable as persons or personalities, even while their actions do not. The two child actors, Ross Malinger and Gaby Hoffmann, are terrific as well. Rosie O'Donnell makes her presence felt forcefully in a supporting role; her delivery of several of the movie's wittiest lines, no matter how brief, is pitch-perfect. Victor Garber and Rob Reiner only get a few minutes of screen time, but they certainly make the most of them to shine and to delight the audience.(I thought I only noticed a single false note about the actors' performances. In a weird departure from their realistic mode of delivery throughout the movie, in a discussion at Sam's kitchen table, both Tom Hanks and Victor Garber get tearful while talking about the movie _The Dirty Dozen_. I thought the scene rang very false; it was as if a minute or two from your regular TV sitcom was suddenly inserted into _Sleepless in Seattle_; the only thing missing was canned laughter; I found the moment painful to watch, and not funny at all; fortunately, it only lasted a minute or so; and Rita Wilson did not join in the two actors' shenanigans, but rather rescued the scene thanks to remaining who she was supposed to be in the movie. I thought Hanks & Garber did not perform well in that particular brief and untypical moment, but it would be hard to blame them for it; rather, I'd say it was a mistake on the part of the screenwriter/director to include a heterogeneous moment like that in the script.)",Sleepless in Seattle

Her screenplay had it all, a very clever piece, with romance, comedy, little drama and suspense just enough to make it work – just enough – is very important when it comes to communicating to the audience and it takes a lot professionalism to make it look easy. This touching film delights in each and every frame because of the clever and well-balanced way it is casted and written. The story is told through the characters own words and their cunning dialogs which never become slaved to the plot; the quirky roles, the subtlety and downplayed humor, little bit harsh and dry sometime but definitely cherry of the supporting characters form the fertile ground that allows Annie and Sam's love to grow up and bloom over our wounds and dull existence.

122,Petunia-2,Almost Perfect Romantic Comedy,10,13 October 1999,"Except for minor flaws, Sleepless in Seattle was the perfect romantic comedy.  Meg Ryan portrays a Baltimore newspaper writer who is engaged to a very dull Bill Pullman (as always, he nails the part), although she doesn't realize it and thinks she is in love.  I found it very endearing to watch Ryan, throughout the entire film, try to talk herself into believing that she and Pullman have a magical, romantic relationship even though they clearly don't.  En route to her parents' house on Christmas Eve, where she will introduce Pullman as her fiance, she overhears a young boy on the radio who has phoned into a talk show.  He is worried about his dad, a widower who can't seem to get over his grief.  Ryan hears Tom Hanks voice and falls in love, obsessing over meeting him in person.There are so many good performances in this film.  Rob Reiner as  Hanks' best friend, David Hyde Pierce as Ryan's brother, and especially Rita Wilson, Hanks real-life wife, who portrays his sister-in-law.  The scene where Wilson tearfully describes why a certain movie affects women is hysterical.  And Hanks' response to her is equally funny.The flaws:  no one in any of the Baltimore scenes had a Baltimore accent, although they did work in Ryan's love of the Orioles which is realistic since most Baltimore women are obsessed with sports.  Rosie O'Donnell was AWFUL (yuck!) as Ryan's coworker friend--she was wooden and read her lines like a robot.  I can think of a dozen actresses who could have put life into this role, especially Laura SanGiacomo of tv's ""Just Shoot Me.""  Also, the actors were all white--not a single black, Hispanic, Asian, etc. had a major role in the movie--why?Except for these last few notable annoyances, it would have been a perfect movie.",Sleepless in Seattle
123,georgeredding,unrealistic but endearing,8,3 February 2021,"This movie has been added to my repertoire. Yes, it is a favorite of mine.
However, the story is far-fetched. Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks) becomes a widower, and, of course, he is upset. He wants to get away from unhappy memories so he moves to Seattle, where he still is sad and thus is sleepless. Fourteen months later, after his son Jonah calls in to a talk-show for unhappy people one night, the psychologist hosting the program Dr. Marsha Fieldstone gives that catchy name Sleepless in Seattle to Sam.
Fourteen months later, in Baltimore Annie Reed (Meg Ryan) and her husband-to-be Walter (Bill Pullman) eat an early Christmas dinner at his house. To cut through a lot, it is enough to say that Annie has to ride back to her apartment by herself, and it is then that she happens to hear Sam on the radio; she becomes suddenly taken with him because of his voice. (Now really! That makes about as much sense as me being taken with Cinderella, the cartoon character in Walt Disney's 1950 full-length cartoon by the same name a few days before I marry
which didn't happen!) Truly, Annie's thoughts turn to Sam.
It is at that point that Annie, by internet and even a private detective, and even a trip to Seattle, pursues Sam. During that time she takes tips from the movie ""An Affair to Remember.""
The movie starring Ryan and Hanks, has four settings-Chicago, Seattle, Baltimore, and New York.

The style of the film seemed like a soft, easy listening to music while reading a wonderful book.  The cast were ideal.  Meg Ryan looks best in this film.  Wholesome looks fits her perfectly.

125,Rebochan,It succeeds at what it sets out to do,10,23 June 2001,"I won't lie to you-this movie is a CHICK FLICK!  Though I never saw it with a guy, it is definitely a chick flick.  That said, it's a high-end chick flick, which probably a few guys might enjoy, unless they happen to be the exploding helicopter type^^;  This movie feels more like a modern day adaptation of the classic romance ""An Affair To Remember,"" and it keeps referencing it too (In fact, the Cary Grant classic is very integral to the plot).  Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have great chemistry together, and they both do what they're good at-Tom Hanks portraying the Everyman, and Meg Ryan being cute and innocent.  I have to disagree with an earlier comment that this film is unfair to guys-the way the characters are portrayed, I'd have to say that in the reverse situation, I'd still feel the same way.  Meg Ryan does not have the ""evil woman"" syndrome that popped up in later 90's chick flicks (The most notorious of which was ""My Best Friend's Wedding"").  She is very believable and actually does care about the feelings of her fiance. What I particularly liked is that the fiance was not portrayed as someone who Meg would do well to leave.  Most movies fall into this trap-Someone is about to marry someone who is horrible and find that someone else is better, the viewer supposedly not feeling bad because the fiance was a jerk anyway. Tom Hanks really shines here as someone who has lost the most important person in his life and is trying to rebuild again.  He always has a knack for easily slipping into the roles he's given and making them really convincing.  He does not fail here-you feel for him especially during the sequences where he starts remembering his late wife.  The movie's plot starts to stretch plausibility at the end, but not to the point where it destroys the entire film.  The ending scene in particular is handled very carefully.  You could have had a big, romantic, tear-jerking moment. Instead, the movie takes a more simplistic approach, and it succeeds-it feels much more natural than the alternative.  Overall, if you're in for a feel good romance, you should see this.  If you happen to be female, this is DEFINITELY worth watching.",Sleepless in Seattle

It's a believable story and it's wonderfully acted by all concerned.As a small footnote, might I highlight the tiny sequence when Jonah picks up a cab on arriving in NY. One of the two guys hailing cabs has just one line ... and it's fabulous: To the cab driver ""Why don'tcha get further from the kerb next time buddy?!"" It's such a small piece of dialogue, yet so very well delivered.

His calm, cool reaction doesn't seem very true to life from a guy who finds out his fiancé is leaving him. If I were in Walter's situation I would be devastated. I know this because I lost four fiancés to other guys. Each time I felt as if the girl had thrust her hand into my chest, ripped out my heart and threw it away!

130,JSouth1,A Tear-Jerker even MEN may cry over!(may contain some spoilers),8,2 January 2005,"OK-- It has been mentioned, that what Meg Ryan did in this film amounts to stalking. Probably.(Though REAL stalking usually involves harmful intent, and none was intended here). That she used bill Pullman. Well, at LEAST she was honest with him, when she went to meet Tom Hanks near the end. She did NOT leave him hanging, as many Women (or men, if the situation were reversed) would do, without worrying about the pain they had caused the other person.But hey, if she did not really love Bill Pullman, why should she have just ""settled"" for him? If hearing of Tom hanks situation gave her second thoughts on Marrying Pullman, she shouldn't have gone through with the marriage. After all, ENGAGEMENTS are supposed to be a time to decide if this is the person you want for the rest of your life.Having said that, let's not forget that this just a movie. As such, it is a GOOD one, that tugs at the heartstrings, and is just one of those movies that will make a person fell warm inside, especially at the end.Plus, you do NOT have to be a woman to be touched by this movie. As a 37 year old single male, I am touched whenever I see this movie, and I saw it when it was new. I do not really consider this to be a ""chick flick"", and do not get emotional at a lot of such movies. For example I saw ""Titanic"", at the end of '97, on it's first run. I went with my sister and cousin. BOTH of them cried hard near, and at, the end, and one woman behind us was crying uncontrollably. NOT ME. After all, EVERYONE knows what happened to the Titanic, so the ending was NOT a surprise to me. I did not feel much emotion , and was laughing, from the outburst by the woman behind us, as we were leaving.Not so with this movie.

134,alxx0209,""" Magic "" or Mayhem ??",7,3 September 2013,"a Tom Hanks movie ? I am a huge Hanks fan he has such a passion and commitment to every single movie he does. I have loved all of his movies that i have seen him in so far. and do I like him in this film?Well I suppose - This movie is about love and all its complications dealing with Sam / Annie and Jonah. The Three of them are trying to find "" magic "" in a relationship - I personally have not yet felt ""magic"" in a relationship - I have not even dated at all so I do not relate to "" magic "" but I can somehow imagine the delightful feeling in ones heart when you see the difference in Annie as the movie goes on and she learns what magic feels like. The movie seemed just a little slow in the beginning in my opinion but after a bit it has a certain pace to it that is enjoying. The movie reminds me of a few other films yet Hanks and Ryan are charming and The Kid also helps out the movie go forward / I also believe that Hanks other films success kind of help / Hurt this one in away - I mean Im not comparing it to his other roles but this one seems specifically about love - and I would say its like 70 % romantic and 30 % comedy but again I liked the movie for what it set up and Tom / Meg and the kid did a good job in this film - also a little note I feel that Rob Reiner and Rosie O' Donnell were just alright in there supporting roles but in my opinion they would be under minor roles for this movie. I have to mention a scene that I liked was Annie watching Sam and Jonah goofing around on the beach - thats were it seemed to click for Annie to realize she was in love with both them from just watching them goof around - being themselves , I believe from then on she felt deep down "" magic"" for Sam and even in away Jonah. That moment was something I would call a "" spark "" were it just was beautiful for what it was. That moment you could tell what her heart said to her. Final thoughts ? well Toms Hanks did an amazing job plays such likable and relatable characters ( including this one ) Meg did a decent job -Pullman who played Walter did alright the role kinda fell short - Like your about to marry her and you let her walk away ? He could have developed more. Also i would say like 2 or 3 slow bits that could have been tweaked. Other then that its a cute movie about love and Magic.

Partly I believe, this is due to weak acting of Meg Ryan who just can't seem to build up the chemistry as there were between her and Billy Crystal in the above mentioned film. What I did like, was the character of Jonah. Tom Hanks is a great actor, and in this movie the interaction between him and the but small Ross Malinger (Jonah) is great. This definitely carries this movie to an acceptable standard.I gave this movie a 5 out of 10.

The sequence with Jonah in the flight and then in NYC - man, what an incredible sequence. Just visually as well. Can watch it a million times. Feel like eating him up! The kid is just TOO cute.2. The scene with Annie and Walter where she breaks up with him. And the whole sequence with him saying ""I dont want to be the guy that anyone settles for. Marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it"" Also the whole messaging of how Walter is perfect and yet something's not perfect and thats enough for her to not SETTLE you know? All the dialogues around this! The fact that its ok for her to lie to Walter and take a flight and go to Seattle and take a chance because IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE MAGICAL. Also the scene where Walter gives her the ring and she says the dialogue about how she is not the one who loves surprises when it's obvious she is having second thoughts. Its brilliant how they have shown the whole arc about Annie's thought process in such a short time. Brilliant brilliant writing there/ Kudos to Nora!3. Loved the sequence where Sam and Jonah are playing at the beach - and their bonding in general. It really really looks all completely real. Beautiful direction man!4. The scenes where Jonah plans the whole thing and books tickets through Jessica - ah! I am in love with Jonah so i should just say everything that he does!5.

143,driverscience,This movie was a misrepresented tragedy,2,13 February 2012,"This movie propagates the common myth, that happiness lies just over the next horizon. This obvious aspect of the film, sticks out like a sore thumb, to such a point, that it makes it unbearable to watch. I had to grin and bear it with my wife, who had enjoyed it. She had a different opinion. I could see that this film was attempting to appeal to the romantic nature in us, at the expense of delving entirely into a dangerous fantasy.It sets up an unrealistic view of reality, I suppose like many romantic films. But this one is the worst I have seen, because it comes too close to the truth, in a misleading way. Don't get me wrong, I am a romantic. I enjoy the Twilight series as well as Disney films, among many others. These are fantasy, but so clearly fantasy that one can truly escape reality, which is, I think the primary reason people enjoy films.With certainty Meg Ryan's character will not be happy with her next relationship. Studies prove this. There is always magic at the beginning of every relationship. I can predict that in several years that the magic will leave the next relationship. The flaw is in her, not in Bill Pullman's character, who is a good man.In summation, I perceived the movie as watching two foolish people, making the obvious blunder of thinking the next relationship will make them happy.

The leads only had about 5 minutes total of screen time together, yet they have so much chemistry in the closing scene.Annie (Meg Ryan) is recently engaged to Walter (the spunky Bill Pullman, my crush from the nineties), and seems to be happy, until she hears 8-year-old Jonah on the radio. His mother died 18 months ago, and his Christmas wish is that his father will find a new wife so that he won't be so sad. His father Sam (Tom Hanks), then talks about how wonderful his wife was and how much he adored her. Something changes in Annie, and she realises there is something about this man that she has to learn more about. Many would call it stalking, others would call it romantic, but suddenly she is flying across the country for a glimpse of him. Out of all the women who wrote to his Dad, Jonah likes Annie's letter the best, and sets up a romantic first encounter on the top of the Empire State building. Awwwww!!! I think from the start everyone knew how it would end, but it's wonderful to watch.Every single actor is outstanding, especially the young boy who played Jonah, many movies have been ruined by horrible children who cannot act, but he's great, and doesn't try to be too cute. 10/10",Sleepless in Seattle

There's not much to say about it except that it's the epitome of what a 'chick flick' should aspire to be.

I have always felt both Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are over-rated actors and this movie is a living proof of that. Throughout the movie, I felt sorry for Bill Pullman who seemed to have taken his role somewhat seriously.The idea that two very good-looking adults falling in love according to a plot from an older movie is absurd. What is more ridiculous is that the wisdom emanates from an 8 year old who can recite long sentences without rehearsal! If that's not enough, working people with middle class life styles, seem to be doing nothing but to worry about their love life at work. I am so glad I saw this movie on TV so I would not have to go and ask for my money back.",Sleepless in Seattle

Meaning, if you've already seen it, it won;t be bothersome to watch it again if it happens to be playing on a cable station.This film, though predictable, worked for me. The direction, set design, settings, acting and all of the music give us our romantic comedy experience. It was not too long either.Nora Ephron, who is the director and a writer on this movie, demonstrates an understanding, and a love, of certain kinds of relationships. She shows a focus on how she wants her story to unfold and she delivers it. She works well with her actors, Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Ross Malinger, Rosie O'Donnell, Bill Pullman and the rest. Tom Hanks is really good Meg Ryan is cute. The chemistry between Hanks and Ryan works well. Bill Pullman, as always is interesting to watch.

And how he's in Seattle and she's on the whole other side of the country in Baltimore. This is the best romantic movie ever. For all you couples out there Sleepless In Seattle is the most perfect movie for you. Nora Ephron is such a good director, too. I love some of her movies.

153,selwynandrews-80958,Not Great,2,26 June 2018,"So after watching the dreadful Set It Up I needed a decent romcom to clear the palate and saw When Harry Met Sally. Pretty great. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, written by Norah Ephron, directed by Rob Reiner. So last night I was tempted by Sleepless in Seattle, with Ephron, Ryan and Reiner showing up again in a slightly different configuration. Oh boy, the news is not good. Few scenes work, they lurch and stagger along and then just expire. Here's a great rule of thumb: when the supporting players have no chemistry, head for the hills. Rosie O'Donnell as Ryan's best friend looks uncomfortable, like her lines have crawled into her mouth and died. Hanks seems stiff and unconvincing, Ryan seems to be phoning it in. It's like the movie (or the director, or the writer) has taken it for granted we'll be swept up in the romance and hasn't bothered to do anything to earn our submission. Great romcoms put flesh on the mechanical romcom skeleton so we don't notice the mechanism. Here, it's laid bare and the whirring and clanking forestalls enjoyment of the goings-on. Interesting that the movie's romantic touchstone, An Affair to Remember (Ryan and O'Donnell mouth lines while watching it, and the Valentine's Day meeting on the Empire State Building is borrowed from it), is similarly stiff, dreary and unconvincing. Guess not everything Ephron touched turned to gold. Or maybe I'm alone in this view.",Sleepless in Seattle
154,Flutter,Fabulous Romantic Comedy - without a single kiss!!,10,17 July 1999,"One of my favourite movies of all time.  Hanks and Ryan have a great chemistry, even though they only have a couple of scenes together.  It treats the audiences as adults, without falling into any normal romance/comedy traps.  Her boyfriend's a nice guy, not marrying her for the wrong reasons, and Hank's character isn't alone due to an evil ex-wife.  The little boy is very cute, and one of the best child actors around. None of the cast let the side down.  The supporting characters are great - Rosie O'Donnell has put in the best performance I've ever seen from her, and Bill Pullman is wonderfully understated as Annie's devoted but jilted boyfriend - he pulls a huge sympathy vote from me. A fantastic movie for a night in with a loved one - it is just sooo romantic, even though there isn't a single kiss between Hanks and Ryan.  Men take note - take this video home from the rental store and she'll be yours for ever.",Sleepless in Seattle

160,jrdnlwn,What a movie!,7,15 June 2015,"Before watching this movie, I looked it up on IMDb and there seemed to be a lot of mixed reviews; many of the positive reviews explained how much of a cute, romantic film it is, while the negative reviews simply stated how boring and pathetic it is. I've got to be honest, I was uncertain about whether or not to watch it because of the reviews, but I thought about it and ended up giving it a try. Now, I have finished watching the movie and I must say, I found the movie very warm and touching. At the same time, the movie seemed to have a little too much forced exposition. There were a couple of moments in the beginning of the film that didn't seem to flow. For an example, it was strange how a woman on one side of a country could feel such a strong connection with a random helpless man on the other side of the country. That man, Sam, is none of her business and she doesn't even know him, but that's what makes the film so ironic. I found that part of the plot very unrealistic, but, I guess, cute in a way. Nevertheless, the plot of the film was interesting to me. As for the acting, Tom Hanks surely did a great job playing his character, and his character seemed the most realistic in this film. Sam never knew that Annie was the right woman for him until he saw her in person. I enjoy the films that Tom Hanks is in, like Big, for an example, and I really enjoyed his performance in this film as well. Meg's character, on the other hand, got a little too dramatic at times. When she got dramatic, the movie felt more like a sitcom, like Good Luck Charlie, but I would rather not ruin the beauty of this film because there are many positive things for me to say about it. I definitely found Ross' character cute. Although I felt sympathy for Jonah at times, I didn't understand how he felt such a strong connection between Sam and Annie. Maybe there was something that I missed in the film that was included in the letter that Annie sent to Sam. Besides that, the acting was very well done!I loved the music that played throughout the film and it seemed to fit the theme very well! It made the film seem more like an older film from the 50s or 60s. A lot of the music sounded a lot like Frank Sinatra, which is commonly played in romantic situations. I have honestly never watched a romantic film before, nor are romantic films my type of movies, but I was truly impressed after watching Sleepless in Seattle. I would recommend this film to anyone; there is nothing inappropriate in this film for younger children, so I think children would also enjoy this. I understand how one could dislike this film, but I do think that this film is very cute, which I hope others can see in this film.",Sleepless in Seattle

And just when you think it's done with it's dumb plot elements another stupid idea is put forth. I liked Harry and Sally though, and this movie has the same feel, but with a lot less thought is put into it. The story is this: Annie has just gotten engaged to this perfect man and she hears Tom Hanks's kid ringing up to a radio station about his dad and how his wife died. Annie feels sorry for him and slowly becomes obsessed. It does not accurately depict people's reactions to situations. Unrealistic characters aren't always bad, if there are no complications. But the way these characters overcome the complications in this movie, it just doesn't work. I did, however like Tom Hanks's kid and his best friend Jessica.

166,Honeybee-ct,Music is used to drive emotions...,10,19 November 2015,"Sleepless in Seattle creates many emotions in the viewers that develop throughout the entire movie through music. When Sam is looking for his son, a piano is used for music, which is slow and soft with minor sad notes. The music however builds up as Sam and Annie get closer together, changing to happy playful tunes, a song of triumph. This creates such an emotional response in the viewers as it tells the viewer how to feel just by the tender sad notes or playful happy notes.The cessation of music creates suspense, a moment for viewers to breathe and wonder what will happen next. Music was controlling the entire ending of Sleepless in Seattle, it unearthed emotions within me because the music took me on a journey whilst watching images, rather than the images taking me on a journey. The power of positive and negative notes in music cannot be measured and Sleepless in Seattle uses music with purpose and intent. This is one of my favourite all time movies!!!",Sleepless in Seattle

If you actually love, you will definitely love this movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm a very practical person and I have a girlfriend, too. I'm not old either, just turned 20. But if you were saying this movie is fake, and the love story is not real, then give me a definition of a movie.Some may say this movie is for desperate person. Well, love is that beautiful. Are Annie(Meg) and Sam(Tom)desperate? Do they look like desperate people? No. The film is about the beauty of love. Does anyone see any sexual activities in this movie? No. Love stands beautifully alone. Love is not lust. I personally hate ""brainless"" love movies that have to include sexual related scene. They are garbage in compare to Sleepless in Seattle. I've watched ""You Got Mail!"". No way it will pass Sleepless in Seattle. I talked to one of my female friend if she knew this movie since it wasn't that popular in compare to other flashy ones. Her response is ""Everyone born and grew up in the U.S and have love actually should have known and love this movie"".

The idea of the story was okay, but not very intriguing, taking the idea of Love Affair but not expanding on it very well. I also severely disliked how every female character was so weepy over the movie, Love Affair. Meg Ryan's character cried, Rosie O'Donnell's character cried, as well as several other women throughout the movie, leaving the male character's to watch stoically and roll their eyes. Even when Meg Ryan's character asks a security guard if he's watched Love Affair, he comments ""Yeah, my wife loves that movie.""I found that kind of annoying, it was a running theme throughout the entire film that women are the only ones to cry over such a ""touching"" story; even a 10-year-old girl cries over it. It's okay to show women crying over a film, but when the only women you show fit this description, it starts to be inaccurate, portraying only an annoying stereotype. I didn't cry after seeing Love Affair, neither did any other women I know. This stereotype is even worse when you see every male character in this movie laughing at how the women are acting, it's like ""oh, that's just how chicks are, crying over a silly movie.""

Apparently she's one of many women who fell in love with Sam based on this lone qualification. Annie already had a fiancée Walter(Bill Pullman) who seems like a really nice guy. Unfortunately for Walter, he doesn't meet Annie's dream romance so he has to go. The meeting is spurred on by the adolescent Jonah, who travels cross-country with his father in pursuit. Of course Sam and Annie fall in love and of course they live happily after after. Here are my problems with the film. First of all, Annie decides to dump a perfectly nice man based on a a stranger's telephone call. That is weird and disturbing. Of course, Sam here is a perfectly nice guy, but he could just as easily been the next Jeffery Dahmer. Next is her treatment of Walter who seems devoted to her, in response to his devotion she breaks up with him, on Valentine's Day of all days, to hook up with a guy she's never met or indeed seen. There is the behavior of the son Jonah who is able to get cross-country tickets without his father's permission and have his dad meet up with Annie.

178,Yugi-Muto,It must be destiny...,6,15 March 2016,"Sleepless in Seattle is difficult for me to review. For the most part, I like this movie but for whatever reason I can't seem to bring myself to love it. It's somewhere between good and okay for me. I think it's to do with the idea of love this movie presents. It makes love to be somewhat of a fantasy (okay so that doesn't sound like a bad thing but stick with me for a moment). So Annie (portrayed by the lovely Meg Ryan) listens to the radio one day and hears a guy's story (said guy portrayed by Tom Hanks) about his wife dying and how he's been feeling lonely since then, unable to get back on his feet to start dating again. She begins to think that this guy sounds really sweet, she just can't stop thinking about him and it's evident that in her mind, she begins to play him up to be her Prince Charming. It's her perfect love, everything she wants, the only problem...she's never actually met the guy and I think this is where my problem stems from. You've probably heard of love being blind, well this movie plays with that idea and the idea of love at first sight...or sound/thought/whatever. Anyway, here's my fundamental issue with the movie and why I can't bring myself to love this movie. It deals with the idea of being in love in a movie which is actually mentioned in my favourite line of the movie ""you don't want to be in love, you want to be in love in a movie."" How true those words are for a lot of people and even for me. The idea of that perfect person makes you fall for them because you picture them to be exactly what you want them to be and that's where my problem lies, because as much as I love the idea, it's not one I believe in. To me, love is about loving someone no matter what, accepting their flaws. Not everyone is perfect and although this movie recognises that, it's not something that is dealt with (and if it was and I missed it, then it wasn't in a way that was satisfactory to me since I didn't notice it). Sleepless in Seattle is about the idea that love is blind, it can happen at any moment, at any any time and with anyone. That's how I interpret it. However, it never explores anything beyond that. It's almost like a fairy tale and maybe that was the point of it, but for whatever reason I wasn't satisfied. It only looks at the idea of romance but never explores it since you never really get to see the two leads together properly. Yet for some reason, I find myself wanting the two leads to meet despite Meg Ryan's character feeling like a stalker and when they do meet, I'm disappointed because it ends without us ever seeing them together as a couple or even as friends for that matter. Is it a romantic movie? Yes, in fact it's very romantic since as I said, it plays on the idea of blind love but at the same time, the script is written in such a way that it makes me question everything and leaves me with an ambivalent feeling about the movie. I want to love it because the idea of love being blind is great but I can't because I don't believe in such a thing or at the very least, the movie wasn't executed in such a way that made me want to believe it. I strongly believe that true love, be it in a movie or in real life, is when two people know each other and without a shadow of a doubt, love them despite everything that might drive them crazy about the other.",Sleepless in Seattle
179,lionsawake,sleepless in sun,9,18 February 2006,"Although this film relies so much on the plot of 'An affair to remember' the central protagonists act splendidly. Every scene fits in seamlessly with the next; this film has so many quirks, namely 'David Hyde Pierce'(Niles from Fraiser) is supremely witty in his brief part as Ryan's (Annie's) brother. I also loved the theme of the United States map, the classic songs, Rosie O' Donnell's extra-marital affairs, Walter's allergies, Clarise's blandness (babysitter), 'tirimasu' and lastly but most importantly 'Jonah.' It wouldn't have been the same without him. The fact that the fashions of the 90's are reflected in the film makes it interesting. People didn't seem as interested in fashion trends in the 90's; I loved the coats. If you loved this movie you must watch 'You've got mail.'

183,escapade_gurl,For all the ladies who love chick flicks(and gents who will sit through it)!,9,29 September 2007,"Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan star in this chick-flick romantic comedy. Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks), a widower of a year and a half's deceased wife and father of eight-year-old Jonah (Ross Malinger) has had difficulty coping with his loss, so he is sleepless every night, which leads him to his pen-name, Sleepless in Seattle, when Jonah calls into a Chicago radio show Christmas Eve, expressing to the host he thinks his father needs a new wife. While Annie Reed (Meg Ryan)is coincedentially listening to the same radio station, the nosy host asks Jonah to put Sam on the phone and talk about his feelings. This show attracts Annie (along with 2,000 other love-seeking women) to find this man to whom she believes is her destiny (while she is engaged to Walter, played by Bill Pullman) so she is just sane enough to fly out to Seattle after she tracks down where he lives and his phone number, with the advice, guidance, clever dry humor and best friendship of Becky (Rosie O'Donnel), the kind of friend that deep down makes you crave for a friend like her because of her appeal in her character. With the extreme talent of Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Rosie O'Donnel and Victor Garber all in one bite, it is easier to swallow your meal whole. It is very rare to find the key ingredient in a good actor, precisely the reason Tom Hanks captivates the audienec so well. Give him any character you want and he can be it, especially in this film, which is a heartbroken but captious humoring man, who will draw you to hang onto every word. With that humor his hollowness begs him to reveal a smiling flashback of the attraction of his wife. It is a film that makes the female-watcher wish that somewhere out there, the perfect someone would describe you romantically and make you feel special too. A definite must-see on a lonely Saturday night or a rainy Sunday afternoon in Seattle!",Sleepless in Seattle
184,skagrawal_friends,It insults my understanding of love,1,8 February 2018,"I rate movies on imdb quite often but very rarely do I review them. This movie was the most ridiculous romantic movie I've ever seen and it forced me to vent my frustration here. It insults the way I understand love. Its not a love story. Its nothing. Its just a story of a stupid child falling in love with a woman coz' her favorite baseball player is the same as his Dad's favorite baseball player. Now, my review has spoilers, but please do read it and save yourself the frustration of going through the movie.Picture this: Meg ryan falls in love with Tom hanks just by listening to his sob story on radio about how much he loved his deceased wife and writes him a love letter. In fact, thousands of women write him a love letter after listening to his sob story (Really, are women that desperate? Which planet is Tom Hanks living on?).Now, if you somehow convince yourself to believe that it is possible for a girl to fall in love like that, now picture this: The kid reads all the letters including Meg Ryan's and immediately decides that Meg Ryan is destined to be his new mom. Now what is so magical about this letter? We don't know. All we know is that a)Meg Ryan has not written a letter like this to a stranger before.
b) She writes something about magic.
c) She tells Tom hanks to meet her at Empire State on Valentines Day.
c) She mentions her favorite baseball player and hey stranger, I love you only if he is your favorite too. Otherwise, don't bother.
Apart from that we just don;t know what was written in the letter that made the child go mad about Meg Ryan. Now, 99/100 times, characters would read such letters on screen to let the audience know its contents. But here, Meg Ryan doesn't read it out loud. The kid doesn't read it out loud. Tom Hanks literally 'blah, blah, blahed' it. Why don't they read it out loud for us? I'll tell you why. Coz' even the writer/director couldn't fathom what a stranger woman could write in a letter that could make Tom's kid going mad about her look justifiable.Now, although the kid is madly in love with her after reading the letter, Tom Hanks is not impressed at all. Like I said, he literally 'blah, blah, blahed' it. However, his kid practically blackmails him into meeting her at Empire State. And just to make sure that him holding her hand and falling in love with her instantly doesn't look farcical, the director tries to justify Hank's actions by establishing a 'connection' between the two. It involves him checking her out once at the airport (Men will be men! They all check out beautiful girls all the time. Didn't know that amounts to 'connection') and saying hello to her once on the street and BAM!! There is obviously a connection. They are made for eachother.Now, that's not all. Both Tom and Meg are dating someone at the time. And they are both perfect. But in order to make them look like obvious dumping material, they are reduced to caricatures.
Meg's fiance is allergic to everything and sneezes a lot. Obviously, he deserves to be dumped. SO WHAT, if he loves you and downsized her mother's ring for you?
Tom's girlfriend laughs like hyena (Although, I felt her laugh wasn't even that bad. I mean it wasn't Janice bad. Friends' fans would know what I'm talking about). But obviously, its enough evidence to dump her, My Lord! The catch here is that Tom Hanks doesn't even feel that way about her. Its the kid who hates her. I wonder what the kid would have done if Meg Ryan too had a weird laugh like that.All right. Rant over",Sleepless in Seattle
185,clearsky111,I don't know why...,10,25 June 2006,"I don't know why I like this movie so much. There's no one thing that I can point to, but it's one of the few movies I can watch over and over again. Maybe it's the subdued performances of two very likable actors. Maybe it's because it's a combination of determinism (they're meant to be together) and free-will (he/she flies all over). Maybe it's the soundtrack -- And dialogue gems like these:Jessica: I am telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and the stewardess won't carry you around and stuff like that. Jonah Baldwin: Are you crazy! Who'd believe I'm twelve? Jessica: If it's in the computer, they believe anything. But again, there are other movies with stronger acting (As Good As It Gets), better plot (too many to name), but some weird combo of above average qualities make this movie a 10.

And he sees her and she finds her pretty. That's love.I mean don't get me wrong, I liked how the movie started, but Annie doesn't prove herself in any way. she has a fiancée that loves her and who has some unconvincing quirks that make him the one that must be dumped. i mean the guy does nothing wrong. Annie gets the idea that the guy isn't good for her indirectly from her mother... and what does she do ? She decides to break up and go meet a guy on a roof. and the fiancée accepts like a good little puppet, because if there were any heartbreak from his part, the movie would have went down the tube. the movie is hanging on only a thread of optimism.Of course, us, the viewers know that Sam isn't a bad guy and that he deserves a decent relationship. Sam is sane, tries a normal way to see if he can have a relationship. I like him. But if you cut out all of his scenes Annie just seems kinda nuts. You can't see her relationship falling apart. She just falls for Sam. And that stupid movie every woman in the movie is crying about... so what ? Because somehow they finally met in a similar manner makes it lovely ? Not really, no.A movie for romantics? Sure. Just to remember that your girlfriend who seems very much in love with you will dump your carefree, no complicated past, caring, compassionate self for a guy with emotional baggage, with a kid, who she only met.

""Sleepless in Seattle"" is definitely one of those. I can't exactly say what it is that makes this movie so special. Possibly the great cast with a very likable Tom Hanks and loevely Meg Ryan. Maybe the well told story about a guy who lost the love of his live and a women who's looking for this love. Maybe it's because the movie has one of the most beautiful ending scenes in recent film history.

191,MattShimkus,One of the Best,9,22 May 2008,"This is one of the best films about love and falling in love. While it does break some 'romantic comedy' conventions, it still allows us to see the tragic and comic follies of others as an example of how people encounter one of the most basic human needs. Hanks and Ryan are brilliant as the opposites of this film, and their comic timing and character work are to be applauded. The cast is rounded out with lovely performances from Victor Garber, Rosie O'Donnell, and a young Ross Malinger. If you love, this is a great film. If you don't, try it, and then watch this film. I would put this right up there with ""Philadelphia Story"" and ""It Happened One Night.""",Sleepless in Seattle
192,andydavis,plot hole (spoiler),6,24 March 2006,"Bit of a howler. When Hanks's annoying child (and he is extremely annoying) catches the flight from Seattle to New York, Hanks finds out and chases. As we are shown that the flight hasn't arrived at NYC when Hanks sets off (as shown in the dashed line illustrative cut), logic would dictate that Hanks would phone the airport ahead, to make sure that the kid was picked up (probably by the police) when the plane landed. In fact, the cabin crew would be alerted and be ready for the police on landing. There is no way that Hanks as a responsible parent wouldn't do this, as who would want their 6 year old child walking around NYC by himself?It's quite a fun film, but it's not a 10/10. The director keeps trying to make excuses for why the film isn't a great movie, by insinuating that it's a chick flick, therefore fellas won't get it (by creating the analogy with An Affair to Remember), thus invoking a sense of feminist camaraderie about the movie, which in turn possibly makes women want to like the movie more in the spirit of all things feminine. Unfortunately, that doesn't wash, as there are some fantastic rom coms and romance movies out there. (such as Le Mari de la coiffeuse, which was release 3 years before this film, possibly the greatest rom com of the 90's). When Harry Met Sally is also considerably better.Not wanting to knock it any more, it still a good film. If only that kid weren't such a pain in the ass!",Sleepless in Seattle

Writing a review for a movie which was released even before I was born is really funny.Too bad I hadn't seen it until today... Rom-com is a genre which I rarely engage inI think the last time I saw a Rom-com was ""No String Attached"" (2011)What can I say I really liked this film.It is a simple sweet story. Sam(Tom Hanks), has lost his wife and lives with his 8 yr old son and has recently moved to Seattle, WA. Even after a year and a half he still finds himself missing his wife and pining for love. Then one incident happens which changes everything.Surely one of the best Romantic movies I have seen so far, having usually seen the Tom Hanks in his Dan Brown films, it was weird for me watching him so young. Meg Ryan plays her part to perfection.The film is studded with amazing singles from the 80's.

Not a bad one, but a weak one. It's full of cliche situacions and it's very, very predictible.But over all, as I said, it's weak. There are a lot of plots or details that the movie does not resolve at all and felt needed to do so. For example, why the kid was so obssesed with the girl who wrote the letter? I don't know if they forgot to give explanations or just didn't want.Tom Hanks is the best of the movie. Well, that's nothing new. The weird is Meg Ryan's character. Althought Ryan's portrayal of it is not bad, the character is so irritating that sometimes you just wish that they don't end up together.So my conclussion is that is not a bad movie and it have it's moments but is really hurted by a poor, weak and predictible script.",Sleepless in Seattle

Ja, ja, Annie is the confused single making it all the way to Seattle (I've been to Seattle myself looking for love, alas--actually, fortunately--unsuccessfully), but it's Jonah who gets on the plane to New York, providing the final catalyst for the inevitable meeting.

They've just lost their wife/mother unexpectedly (ring a bell?) When Glen Ford is reunited with his son, his line is very close, if not verbatim, to the line Tom Hanks uses in Sleepless - when he says something along the lines of what would I do if I didn't know where you were for an hour, day, or week (something along those lines).

Could the mediocre performances of the actors have contributed to this ""warmth""? When all logics and intelligence fail to work, producers of this movie decided to put in half a dozen of beautiful scenes. We see fireworks, we see view of the city Chicago, and we see this lovely sight of the State Empire building with a red love star... How many souls could these scenes truly stir? Well we can be sure that none of the souls of our fellow actors of this movie were.",Sleepless in Seattle
219,waterhcy,A movie only romantic,5,25 December 2004,"i don't really like this movie. Maybe it's very romantic. But it indeed tells me beautiful love can only be realized by movie editor. I'm a newer for this movie,and you should notice that I am from China and watch it recently. My feeling tells me such: the whole love procedure in this movie is in fact strictly controlled. Tom hanks'happy of love is not from love itself but the director. In my view (If you want to have a view of Chinese view about love), love should be full of possibility not inevitability----at the beginning of the movie, the two leading actor are not supposed to show paralleledly. Of Course, just as the mass said it will meet the one who purely love the love affair without his own feeling.",Sleepless in Seattle
220,thomas-529,Great movie for the 'hopelessly in love...',9,31 July 2005,"Sleepless In Seattle is all about magic. And THAT makes this movie magical. With Tom Hanks as 'Sam' and Meg Ryan as 'Annie' in the leading roles; you couldn't think of a better combination. There is a chemistry between them, which is very rare in Hollywood movies. Even though they hardly have any scenes which are with the two of them.It's just something about 'Sleepless In Seattle' that separates it from the rest. It's the kind of movie you watch on a cold winter night, cozy on the couch, with your whole family, while drinking some hot chocolate.Sure, the story line is a little surreal. But that doesn't make the movie any less, in fact, it just makes the movie even better. Because love is surreal in a way.'Sleepless...' is an absolute recommend for the hopelessly in love, and is without a doubt one of the best Hollywood movies in his genre. But, if you don't like romantic movies... You wouldn't like this one too.",Sleepless in Seattle
221,kunalb-05263,"""oldie but goody""",8,3 December 2017,"Writing a review for a movie which was released even before I was born is really funny.Too bad I hadn't seen it until today... Rom-com is a genre which I rarely engage inI think the last time I saw a Rom-com was ""No String Attached"" (2011)What can I say I really liked this film.It is a simple sweet story. Sam(Tom Hanks), has lost his wife and lives with his 8 yr old son and has recently moved to Seattle, WA. Even after a year and a half he still finds himself missing his wife and pining for love. Then one incident happens which changes everything.Surely one of the best Romantic movies I have seen so far, having usually seen the Tom Hanks in his Dan Brown films, it was weird for me watching him so young. Meg Ryan plays her part to perfection.The film is studded with amazing singles from the 80's. I loved the ""Make someone happy"" by Jimmy Durante.Go watch it you won't regret it!",Sleepless in Seattle
222,juerghofer,if a movie touches you,10,26 December 2005,"like this one, a 10 is all you can do. Tom is great, Meg the woman plays the woman's role like nobody else could have.....If I get tears in a movie, the movie is a m o v i e ........touching. Thank you folks who did it, the folks who wrote this wonderful story. Am I sentimental? Yess. And it feels good. Each turn of the story makes you wish, hope, and finally no violence in a movie. What a relief. If you watch this movie around x-mas, you probable get more sentimental than in a hot summer night, I don't no. It took me 12 years to get to see this movie. Heard so much and everything I heard was an understatement. Thank you Tom and Meg and specially Ross, love you.",Sleepless in Seattle
223,sixtasman,"xmas IS a hot summer night, for many of us",9,16 December 2006,"That jurghofer fellow or whatever has gotta learn something. He said ""What a relief. If you watch this movie around x-mas, you probable get more sentimental than in a hot summer night."" For a LOT of people, xmas IS smack in the middle of summer. Regularly. Its amazing the number of people on this site who are America-centric or Northern Hemisphere centric. 'WTF!!!? Have they never ever heard about the rest of the world? Anyway, Meg Ryan was a cutie in this pic, and certainly gave me the hots, even tho it was summer when I watched it (like, around xmas, so take note all of you thickos up north who have never heard that people actually live below the equator). I'd walk over broken glass for that lady.",Sleepless in Seattle
