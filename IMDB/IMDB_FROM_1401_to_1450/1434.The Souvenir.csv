0,SnoopyStyle,slow big reveal steady decline,6,29 December 2019,"Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) is a film student in 80's England. She is desperate to make her film and has to borrow money constantly from her mother Rosalind (Tilda Swinton). Her boyfriend Anthony (Tom Burke) is not always supportive and is hiding a big dark secret.The first half is rather slow. It's basically watching a bad couple going about their day. She's hesitant and he's a jerk. Neither are totally compelling or appealing. There is a big reveal in the middle and then it's slow steady decline to the end. It's not the most thrilling of personal dramas. The style is naturalistic with a fly-on-the-wall sensibilities. It's very arthouse and rather slow most of the time. In the end, this is all about getting a first look at actress Honor Swinton Byrne, daughter of Tilda Swinton. She has the same alabaster skin. She doesn't have her mother's alien look. She's like a sadder and more pensive version of her mother. Her reserved nature makes it harder to fill the screen with her personality. This role doesn't help. I'd be interested in her stretching out her acting chops more with another director. She should be glad if she follows the same paths as Meryl Streep's daughters. She needs to show more and in this movie, she only has a few big acting moments.",The Souvenir
1,CinemaSerf,Underwhelming...,4,17 October 2019,"I am not quite sure what Joanna Hogg was trying to achieve here. The depressing inevitability of the film's conclusion left for little jeopardy with the plot. The performances were fine, but nothing more - and the manipulative toxicity of Anthony's behaviour towards Julie isn't developed anywhere near enough. The film does look good, though!",The Souvenir
2,evanston_dad,Stuck with Me Despite Many Flaws,8,8 November 2019,"I was prepared to hate this movie based on all of the descriptions of it as nothing more than a tedious chronicle of a toxic relationship. But while those descriptions aren't inaccurate, I found there to be more to it than that, and though I can admit that this movie had many flaws, it kind of got into my head and stuck with me.I usually have no patience with people, though in movies it's most frequently women, who allow themselves to be treated like dirt by those around them. But in this movie, I understood the dynamic and could see why this particular woman falls into the relationship trap she does. She's had a posh, cushy upbringing and doesn't have much life experience. She wants to be a filmmaker, and the advice she keeps getting is to make movies about what she knows. But she doesn't know anything, and therefore doesn't have anything to make movies about. Enter a troubled heroin addict, which for many in the relationship world is shorthand for ""emotionally complicated,"" and suddenly she's got stories to tell in the locker room. She's a little bit drawn to the drama, even if most of her knows that it's making her miserable and that she should run for the hills.Now why she's drawn to this particular guy we don't know and aren't told. She doesn't know he's a heroin addict when she first starts dating him, so she's not drawn in by the danger of that. He's got a cosmopolitan air about him and a disdainful attitude that could pass as intellectual to someone who doesn't know better. But he's a drip. Though she's a drip too, so if the shoe fits. The whole film is a bit drippy, actually. There's a gloomy pall over the whole thing that never lifts. It apparently is largely autobiographical, but writer/director Joanna Hogg makes the mistake so many filmmakers do when telling very personal stories. She lived this, or something like it, so she doesn't need context in order to understand it. But we didn't live it, so we don't inherently understand it, and we do need context, else why should we care about these people who are total strangers to us when we first meet them?However, like I said toward the beginning of this review, despite all of its flaws, there is something about this movie that lingered in my head. I'm not sure I ever really cared about the characters or what happened to them, but I did admire the formal aspects of the film, and I appreciated that Hogg doesn't really ask us to care about her characters. She just presents them as they are, and it's up to us to decide how we feel about them. According to the end credits, there is a sequel coming. I don't know that I'll be rushing out to see that, but I would recommend this one.Grade: A-",The Souvenir
3,ferguson-6,welcome another talented Swinton,8,16 May 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Viewers of writer-director Joanna Hogg's semi-autobiographical feature will likely be divided into two distinct groups: those who find it to be a beautifully artistic psychological study, and those who find it to be a painfully slow watch. Fortunately, most who would fall into the latter group will likely skip it altogether, and we can only hope those in the first group will seek it out and encourage similar-minded film fans to attend. Surely both groups can agree that it features a terrific breakout lead performance from Honor Swinton Byrne (daughter of Tilda Swinton).Ms. Swinton-Byrne stars as Julie, a young London film school student. She's soon drawn to Anthony (Tom Burke), an odd man who is somehow simultaneously laid back and condescending. Their relationship builds as he works some vague job at the Foreign Office, and giving every indication that something's not quite right. Many moments of normal life are shown; however we soon learn that Anthony is a master manipulator, and his off-handed requests for 'a tenner' or sticking Julie with a restaurant tab go deeper than being a simple jerk. We know heartbreak is coming for her; we just don't know how when or how hard.Tilda Swinton (a long-time friend of director Hogg) appears in a few scenes as Julie's mom, and as you would expect, she perfectly captures the mother-daughter dynamics. Of course Julie is a film student struggling to make ends meet, but with her frequent requests for 'mom loans' coinciding with the Anthony relationship, mother knows best. Jean-Honore Fragonard's 18th century painting gives the film its title, and provides a terrific scene with Julie and Anthony.Later, when Anthony tells Julie, ""You're inviting me to do this to you"", we recognize this is an abusive relationship similar to those many women have endured. Set in the 1980's, a doomed relationship looks eerily similar regardless of the era. The film serves as an example of how we sit in judgment of the love lives of others, while often remaining blind (or is it hopelessly optimistic) to our own relationship issues.Ms. Hogg shot on film and there are some memorable shots throughout - especially within Julie's apartment. There is a recurring split-screen shot where a wall divides what we see in the kitchen with what's happening in the living area - we see characters on each side. This is the anti-Marvel movie. No special effects. No superheroes. And the only worlds in peril are those of average, flawed people like us.There is a segment involving an analysis of Hitchcock's PSYCHO, and it's clear director Hogg learned lessons about what not to show. There is also a reference to another Hitchcock classic with the tailored grey suit Tom buys for Julie and their trip to Venice. Alfonso Cuaron scored big with ROMA, a very intimate look at his personal life, and filmmaker Hogg's film is in that same vein. It's extremely well made and beautiful to look at, and is likely to be quite challenging for viewers. The payoff comes after much patience and effort and investment into figuring out these characters. It's an arthouse film with improvised dialogue (bonus points for Joe Jackson's ""Is She Really Going Out with Him?""). This was a grand jury prize winner at Sundance, and the sequel is already in production ... good news for some of us, while inexplicable to others.",The Souvenir
4,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Sequel bait.,6,21 November 2019,"'The Souvenir (2019)' plays out like a series of memories, a highlight reel of a distinct period in its protagonist's life. This is perhaps fitting considering that it's based on director Hogg's own past, playing out almost as a kind of catharsis for the emotional turmoil she underwent while in film school. It's nontraditional but considered. There's very little exposition, aside from when there's an overt amount of it, and we're often dropped into the middle a scene without any real context, left to piece together the plot through snippets of dialogue. It almost feels as though the thing is taking place to someone we know but aren't close to; we only understand what we see and we only see what we understand. The movie is relatively distant in this regard - although, the viewing experience is always active. It struggles to provoke a deep connection because we aren't really allowed to get close to anyone. Still, the affair is usually engaging. It isn't a masterpiece but it's always well-crafted and often enjoyable. It's a rather complex look at a complex relationship, subtly painting its characters in eventually fairly vivid colours. However, it does start to wear thin after a while, with a slow pacing that sees it drag towards its end. There also isn't a huge sense of escalation, even if the flick ends exactly when it should. It's a definitive narrative so the fact that it's apparently getting a sequel is rather strange. I'd still watch it, though. 6/10",The Souvenir
5,ThomasDrufke,Dull,4,31 August 2019,"I'm always wary about films with a huge discrepancy between critics and audience reactions, mostly because it typically means a film is either considered pretentious or dumb-fun. That's just the reality of current hollywood. The Souvenir is a movie that you experience more as a spectator from afar rather than something you feel any sort of intimate connection to. It feels like the audio is intentionally hard to dissect, with some scenes either cutting mid conversation or beginning towards the end of one without any sort of context. Which can certainly be a good thing if you're into that sort of filmmaking. I respect anyone's opinion that found Jennifer Kent's direction to be moving and impactful. But I unfortunately found the film to be dull and lacking in personality. For a similar story but better in execution, see 2017's 'Beast'.4.7/10",The Souvenir
6,westsideschl,The Point?,2,20 August 2019,"As I was watching this mostly ""talking heads"" lack of drama unfold I kept asking myself if there was a point to the story.

7,Red-125,Talent wasted in this masochist's delight,6,16 September 2019,"The Souvenir (2019) is an English movie written and directed by Joanna Hogg.The movie stars Honor Swinton Byrne as Julie--a young, privileged film student, Tom Burke as Anthony, who works for the British Foreign Service.
Tilda Swinton has a supporting role as Rosalind, Julie's mother. (Swinton is Honor Swinton Byrne's mother in real life as well.)All three actors are excellent, but the plot is hard to swallow. (OK--director Hogg says this is semi-autobiographical about someone she met when she was in film school. That's hard to swallow as well.)Tom Burke's character is easy to spot as someone with whom you don't want your daughter to fall in love. However, neither mother nor daughter appear to notice. (No one notices that he's never actually at work in the Foreign Service Office either.) Julie is madly, totally in love with him. It's painful to watch.We saw this movie on the small screen, where it worked as well as it would in the theater. For me, it didn't work at all. The only reason I even gave it a 6.0 is because of Tilda Swinton, who makes her tiny role appear important. The IMDb rating is a weak 6.6. My thought was, ""Joanna Hogg, Hilda Swinton and her daughter--how bad could it be?"" Now I know.",The Souvenir
8,howard.schumann,A chronicle of a relationship that is no longer nurturing,9,3 July 2019,"The Souvenir follows Julie (Honor Swinton-Byrne, ""I Am Love""), a young film student in London during the 1980s as she navigates to adulthood through a minefield of obstacles. Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival, The Souvenir is based on the memories of writer/director Joanna Hogg (""Exhibition"") culled from her own vaguely remembered experiences in film school. Cinematographer David Raedeker (""A Christmas Carol"") uses desaturated colors to display tantalizing but only marginally connected images that fleet in and out, giving the viewer the feeling of waking up from a dream and remembering only bits and pieces.Living with bohemian students in a London flat just across from Harrods department store, Julie's financial struggles as a student belie her well-to-do background in Knightsbridge but she has no difficulty calling upon her mother Rosalind (Julie's real-life mom), played by the gracious Tilda Swinton's (""Avengers: Endgame"") to ease her financial strain. Vulnerable and unsure of herself, Julie wants to transcend her limited life experience and direct a film about the dying shipbuilding industry in the town of Sunderland, focusing on a working-class family whose sixteen-year-old son has just lost his mother. Her teachers, however, tell her to find a story closer to her own experience.When raising the question of a budget, someone from film school condescendingly tells her, ""I don't suppose you really have to think about budgets in Knightsbridge, do you?"" Her life changes suddenly when she meets Anthony (Tom Burke, ""The Musketeers,"" TV series), an older man who tells her at a party that ""We're all as real as each other,"" a statement that lifts her spirits and draws her to him. Appealing in a pin-stripe suit, the mysterious Anthony tells her that he works in the Foreign Office but there is nothing to suggest the story is true. Nonetheless, she sees him as a mentor, falling into the bubble she had so much wanted to avoid. When he tells her that she is lost, her mind tells her that she has been found. They go to the opera together, dine at upscale restaurants, and visit the Wallace Collection, an art collection in London.The collection, which is open to the public, houses an enigmatic painting named ""The Souvenir"" by the 18th-century French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard that depicts a young woman with her pet dog, carving letters onto the trunk of a tree. ""She's very much in love,"" Anthony says but Julie detects other emotions such as the woman's determination to make her presence felt. Julie's relationship with Anthony goes from friend to lover and it is not long before he moves in with her, buys her expensive lingerie, and takes her on a trip to Venice. She remains flattered by the attention she has received, yet her passivity and lack of emotional expression make it difficult to know what she is thinking at any given moment.Julie's idyllic odyssey is challenged when she finds bruises on Anthony's arm but does not give it further thought until Patrick (Richard Ayoade, ""Paddington 2""), one of Anthony's friends, tells her a disturbing fact about him, something that neither Julie nor the viewer could have imagined. Though confronted with the terrifying revelation that providing emotional support for a damaged person can be a challenge beyond her capacity, she still loves him and remains by his side, keeping a watch for his return each night and amping up her resolve to stay centered while riding a roller coaster of emotions.Byrne's understated and mostly improvised performance is a revelation and a perfect complement to Burke's turn as the charming but strangely secretive Anthony. While unreliable as autobiography, (Hogg says, ""It's harder to now know what was true and what wasn't"") The Souvenir is a powerful film that will especially resonate with those who may have some painful memories about their own process of growing up.Unlike Alfonso Cuaron's award-winning ""Roma,"" which is rigidly structured and literal in its recollection of past events, The Souvenir is intimate, impressionistic, and bathed in a gauzy sense of unreality, yet, in spite of its soft focus, it lives in your mind. As pianist Igor Levit said about music, ""It has no limit, it's like air - you can't touch it. It only exists within your own imagination."" If you are perplexed, stay tuned, ""The Souvenir, Part Two"" has just begun filming.",The Souvenir

10,masonfisk,WELL INTENTIONED BUT NOT FOR ME...!,2,23 March 2021,This year's well regarded critical darling is a bit of a non starter for me. Although well acted (w/the lead played by Tilda Swinton's daughter Honor Swinton Byrne) this tale of a film student dealing w/her spiraling drug addict boyfriend (played by Tom Burke who is excellent in Cinemax's CB Strike series) is competent but de rigueur as these stories tend to be. Never actually seeing any of the work this aspiring artist is making is a big detriment to the proceedings since all we have are some sporadic classroom or advisor scenes sprinkled throughout the film w/the bulk made up of scenes which feel like a glorified after school special. Tilda Swinton shows up playing her own daughter's mother (I know a stretch!) & Richard Ayoade (a good filmmaker in his own regard see his movie Submarine) as one of Bryne's school chums.,The Souvenir

12,JuguAbraham,Average cinema; the narcissism of the director is audacious,6,2 October 2019,"Did it deserve the Sundance World Cinema jury prize, unless of course its competitors were abysmal? The only two honorable mentions are the screen presence of actress Honor Swinton Byrne (Tilda Swinton's daughter) and the final closing music. Joanna Hogg is average but not great.",The Souvenir
13,proud_luddite,Disappointing and over-rated,5,23 July 2019,"Based on a true story: in the 1980s, Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) is a young British woman from a wealthy family and attending film school. She hooks up with Anthony (Tom Burke) who gradually takes advantage of her while trying to hide his serious personality flaws and habits.Swinton Byrne does not, in any way, give a bad performance; in fact, it is rather good. But she lacks the depth and subtlety required to carry the main role in a two-hour movie. Adding to the trouble is Burke whose Tom is as bland as kale and as common as a condo construction project in downtown Toronto. This character is so lacking in charisma and charm that the film becomes an unintentional mystery as the viewer is left to wonder what Julie could possibly see in him with or without his shortcomings.A sad irony is a scene in the film in which a film teacher explains that ""Psycho"" was a success as most scenes were normal, thus making its abnormal, frightening scenes stand out more. If only writer/director Joanna Hogg had followed the advice that she had written for one of her secondary characters. While the narrative of ""The Souvenir"" is consistent, it does not have any scene that stands out, making it long and dull.A saving grace was the presence of Tilda Swinton (Swinton Byrne's real-life mother) portraying Julie's mother - emphasis on the word 'presence' which was missing in the primary performances. The film would have benefited with more scenes that included Swinton Senior.""The Souvenir"" is hyper-praised in the most baffling of ways by most critics. One of the praises is that it's based on a true story. Well, there are billions of true stories that don't make good films. Sadly, ""The Souvenir"" is one of them. - dbamateurcritic",The Souvenir
14,maurice_yacowar,"Touching, fresh memoir of woman director's early affair and film",10,2 July 2019,"Subtlely, the incongruent last shot recasts the entire film we've just watched. With a swirl of flamboyant flare slacks, heroine Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) walks out through the monstrous steel doors of a sound stage. The landscape outside is the bush-punctuated horizon we saw earlier, over which Julie read the letters that marked the dissolution of her affair with Anthony (Tom Burke).
The soundstage identifies the major feature film we've just been watching, not the film school student projects that have been interwoven with the Julie-Anthony relationship. Those were bitsy pieces including a scene from Measure for Measure. That is, the film we've been watching is a film being made, a narrative being imagined/remembered, not the usual putative elapsing of a life's events. This is meta-cinema.
Julie's flashy pants and confident stride here quite depart from her timorous bearing through the narrative. Expanding her tentativeness, while the other characters worked off Joanna Hogg's memoir script, Honor Swinton Byrne extemporized her lines, drawing on Hogg's journals, scripts, photos and letters from the late '70s, when these events happened to her. She is creating her character on the fly. Hence this narrative feels largely unscripted. Author/director Hogg draws a two-feature narrative (the second half is in the works) out of her memories of student days and her first love affair.
In another fiction/life continuum, the West Raynham Film School is named after the air base hangar where the sets were built and the film shot.
So, too, the self-reflexive title. This Souvenir is a souvenir of another Souvenir, the 18th Century Fragonard painting of a lovelorn woman carving her absent/lost lover's initials into a tree. This work intrigues Julie; Anthony sends her a postcard version. Our film is her record, her carving, of her lost lover's name and their passion into the immortality of art, this time the film.
In addition to being the director's memoir, the film is a clear meditation on the function of art, especially film, especially in the cultural moment of its setting. The late '70s evokes the culture's romantic revolution against traditional British torpor and stiffness.
Both sets of parents -Anthony's and Julie's - embody the bloodlessness of the British upper middle class. Julie's live in a luxurious estate and fund her posh London flat where a garish bedstead and doubled bed accommodate her first affair. Mother Rosalind (Honor's mother Tilda Swinton) steadily ""lends"" Julie the money she needs to support Anthony, under the guise of funding her student film.
Anthony's parents live on a more modest rural estate, appropriate for an undistinguished photographer whose interest in the Sunderland shipyards lies in the beautiful shapes of the ships not in the workers' beleaguered lives. Only Anthony's disintegration punctures the period's pallid aestheticizing of suffering.
As Julie's film profs tell her, she should be drawing her art out of her life. Intending to escape her privileged Knightsbridge ""bubble,"" she plans to tell a grittier Sunderland story. She would focus on a little boy helplessly dependent upon his mother, terrified at losing her - and then she dies. Julie's affair - that drives this film - lives out that plot or dynamic. Julie becomes utterly dependent upon the initially iimpressive but doomed Anthony, who dies. Thus she lives the story that she initially intended only to tell.
Paradoxically, Julie must first assume the mother's function, when she has to support the weak man. Anthony, implausibly claiming to work for the Foreign Office, then to have connections to the Courtauld, initially treats Julie to upper-class London dining but then proves financially dependent upon her - at the same excessively posh places. His financial dependency feeds her emotional dependency, until he dies, freeing her to make her/this movie.
Anthony's black director friend provides another critique of the period cultural war. In his leopard skin costume and with his big-hair brassy blonde partner he is the liberated colonial. He disdains the film school teachers and appreciates the school only for the opportunity it gave him to steal what he needed to make his film.
Curiously, his set-piece argument is that Britain has never made a musical feature film. He reels off the contemporary hit groups - the Stones, the Kinks. etc. - but notably omits the Beatles. This omission points to the larger gap in his argument: Britain indeed did produce several musical features, ranging from Alfred Hitchcock's Waltzes from Vienna (1933), the George Formby vehicles, indeed the Beatles' A Hard Day's Night (1964), Help! ((1965) and Yellow Submarine (1968), John Boorman's Catch Us If You Can, with the Dave Clark Five (1965), inter alia. The man's firm assertion is wrong, the expression of an ungrounded authority, a fraud in his film history as in his filmmaking.
Yet that man has an immediate insight into the Julie-Anthony relationship. He knows what she, for all their intimacy, doesn't - that Anthony is a heroin addict - and he infers the lovers' incompatibility. But the chap is still wrong. Anthony may not be the right man for Julie's love life. But he's the right challenge to launch her artistry, giving her a personal engagement with the story she determined to tell. He breaks her bubble.",The Souvenir
15,andrewroy-04316,"The Souvenir is extremely boring and unlikable, just like its characters",3,29 October 2019,"I had only really seen the critical love and not much of the audience distaste for The Souvenir going in, so was expecting it to be artsy and creative and maybe great. I was bored to tears and didn't like either of the leads at all. There was some good cinematography with some cool shots focusing in on specific things and a couple scenes showing the two leads in separate rooms showing their contrast. Byrne is pretty good in the lead, while Burke's performance was weak and didn't sell a character who was mysterious and intriguing. The central premise of the movie is a relationship where one of the people is an addict. It feels like a mix of Phantom Thread, Beautiful Boy, and Cold War with all the emotion and plot removed from each. Absolutely nothing happens in the movie aside from his death at the end, and there is nothing to emotionally latch onto or be invested in. Antony is an unrelenting jerk with no redeeming qualities, while Julie is a generic picture of an artist who's supposed to be ambitious but never has any real energy and ends up coming off as a meek doormat. I guess it tries to show how a tortured relationship develops, but I struggle to understand what Julie finds interesting about Antony and had no interest in their interactions. It's a lifeless slog that felt like a waste of two hours. You could find meaning in his downward spiral and their relationship, but I've seen all of that done in movies that didn't bore me to death. I give it a 3 rather than a lower score because I understand the ideas Hogg was going for and think the direction and cinematography was pretty decent, but boy is it not a fun one to watch.",The Souvenir
16,danybur,A couple under the sign of denial and concealment,7,30 August 2021,"Summary:The film approaches laterally, with the patience of a goldsmith, the problematic knot of the love affair between a young, affluent and denier film student and an official concealer older than her, -a combination that is not good for the health of a couple. - in the London of the 80s.Review:Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) is a young film student, from a wealthy class, in London in the 1980s. While filming a movie that, according to her, would connect her with other less favored social environments than her own, she establishes a relationship with Anthony (Tom Burke), a civil servant older than her, who will prove problematic for more than one reason.It is not easy to enter into the dynamics of The Souvenir, a film with autobiographical elements by its director Joanna Hogg, which establishes a kind of dialogue or counterpoint between what Julie experiences and the filming of her film, highlighted with historical references to the violent situation that existed with the IRA attacks.The film is expressed from Julie's unique point of view. Given that Julie is a denier (hers transcends naivety) and Anthony is a concealer, the approach to the couple's core problem occurs laterally, almost insidiously, as if passing through the filter of what the protagonist refuses to see. And admit, even in the face of revealing and disturbing dialogues with his friends that shake the monopoly of that point of view in the viewer. On the one hand, this approach, this weight of the off-field, is interesting, although it achieves a somewhat exasperating, overwhelming effect, surely sought by the director.This narrative line dialogues with the filming of the film, where Julie reveals herself to be more of her own and establishes a certain parallel with her personal life (especially from texts entrusted to the young woman's voice-over), but from a so that she does not admit or is forbidden to the viewer. It must also be said that this narrative line carries many cinematic and literary references to Hogg's training as a filmmaker, which from time to time make the film somewhat pretentious. These references are expressed through dialogues with her friends, her colleagues and with Anthony and the texts entrusted to the voice-over, some of them corresponding to the script of that film that she is filming.Honor Swinton Byrne sweetly composes the lover, submissive and denier Julie, while Tom Burke offers an Anthony who is not exactly loved by his initial opacity and the way in which he manipulates his partner, subtly undermining his professional self-esteem (and personal).It is a pleasure to see Tilda Swinton in the role of the mother of the protagonist (of whom she is the mother in real life), as a well-off, progressive and relaxed English lady, far from the series of somewhat exasperated and characterized roles that hat she has played lately.",The Souvenir
17,PotassiumMan,"Disquieting, slightly aloof drama about a poisonous relationship",7,20 May 2019,"Honor Swinton Byrne gives a profoundly subtle performance as an impressionable film student from a privileged upbringing who becomes romantically involved with an enigmatic, charming man who works for the British government. Tom Burke is a stark presence as the young woman's muse. They gradually become inseparable.She is a thoughtful, sensitive person who soon finds herself navigating the pitfalls of his serpentine personality. The film proceeds at a very deliberate pace and is low-key to the point of being catatonic at times. The main criticism of this film is that its slow patches do go on for quite a bit. But out of this dry and methodical narrative eventually emerges a raw tension leading to a conclusion that is quite powerful.Although this isn't quite the masterpiece that many reviews have made it out to be, I found it a worthwhile and subtly rewarding cinematic experience.

18,bastille-852-731547,Okay but Somewhat Disappointing Drama,6,24 May 2019,"As much as I enjoy the better-quality summer blockbusters, I also really appreciate good independent films in the summer as a welcome and refreshing alternative to all the franchise movies and explosions. With that in mind as well as this film's terrific reviews, I was hoping that ""The Souvenir"" would be an excellent film. Sadly, I was let down. While the film certainly isn't bad, it has enough flaws to make it seem a bit empty at times.The film tells the story of a young film student (Honor Swinton Burke) who begins to fall in love. (I won't say anything else to avoid giving something away.) The film is impressive on a technical level, with strong cinematography and superb production design. Sounds are mixed well throughout the film's duration, and the film's understated editing is very well done. Unfortunately, the character development of the male lead is almost nonexistent, which really damages the movie as a whole. It's a very ""cold"" movie emotionally, which can work in some films where the characters' emotions are not on the front burner. But for a romantic drama that expects the viewer to care about its two leads, this stoic tone is both jarring and understatedly erratic. While Swinton Burke is fine in the lead role, and some of the short scenes discussing her interest in filmmaking are interesting enough, her performance is rather flat. Tilda Swinton is terrific (as always,) but she is very sadly wasted and given very minimal screen time. While the film's cinematography is often very good, it can also be repetitive. For example, just how many shots of the front of opening and closing elevator doors are in this movie? If you have to start thinking about that while watching the movie after the first several, then there are too many. I also believe the film would have been better if it had a score. I was really hoping to love this movie given how great the trailer and reviews from critics were, but I was left a bit disappointed. 6.5/10",The Souvenir

The main character was also implausibly forgiving of the shabby conduct of her louche beau.Watching films at home I can hit pause and see a bar along the bottom of the screen that tells me how long is left. I frequently felt the need to do this during the film.Part of the screen in the cinema had lifted slightly, like peeling wallpaper. This affected a very small part of the screen, but the film failed to engage me sufficiently me to overlook it.The music played in the film was good, but it did not assist to redeem the film as different tracks came in fits and starts as if two people were in a record payer duel.",The Souvenir
21,mbrcf,"a multi-layered, divisive film",7,8 May 2020,"Joanna Hogg's the Souvenir is a divisive film. You may absolutely adore every part of it, you may feel indifferent and cold towards it or straight up hate it for what it is. The film is set in 80s London, and is loosely based on Hogg's own memoirs and experiences as a young film student. It is one of the most personal films I have ever seen, almost as if the director's thoughts and memories were somehow visualized and brought into pictures.At first glance, this might look like another one of those bad romance, toxic relationship films but the film is ultimately about Hogg's past, what she took from such encounters and what shaped her to be the director she is today.This is also a very cinematic film. From the studio scenes and lengthy conversations about Hitchcock and Godard to visible cuts, artistic camera work and incoherent story-telling, some elements of cinema is present in nearly every scene, constantly reminding us that we are watching a film, a film that Hogg made with total freedom and liberty.",The Souvenir

However, as Gilly-13 notes, the probable explanation for the lead's willingness to stick with this deeply awful man is a kind of emotional vampiricism from which she can derive material for her films, as a substitute for her own empty slate (indeed - still is, given the ""semi-autobiographic"" nature of the story). If true, then this makes it rather more interesting, and indeed plausible - why would someone make a film that implies they were hopelessly naive and exploited when younger?The big problem though (for me) is that the whole thing came across as *really* amateurish. Unless it's also some kind of meta-joke where she *wanted* it to look like someone's first film-school project, one really can't excuse the poor dialogue (improvised or not), stilted flow and general surfeit of boredom throughout.",The Souvenir

And that's a cute opening for a movie review, for sure, but the ideas stemming from the title of this film are lovely and true. A souvenir could be completely ephemeral trash or something one treasures quite dearly. Watch this movie and think about things are connected. This made me wish movies would do more with their titles.This is a bold film with real depth told in fragments. We don't really know if a week, a few days, or longer, have passed between scenes. Julie, a young woman attending film school and the surrogate for writer-director Joanna Hogg telling a fictionalized version of her own life story, is in a relationship with an older man, Anthony. There's no real courtship and the nature of their bond is cloudy at the start. I appreciated this. It felt real, as did so much of the fine dialogue Hogg pens.Julie's advice upon finding a curious marking on Anthony's arm is to ""leave it, let it go away."" Much of the conflict at the helm here occurs off-screen or is dealt with indirectly.Julie purports to be making her student film about a boy, his mom and the seaside town of Sunderland, shown in black and white photos at the onset. She shoots in a soundstage with fellow students. Most ideas are better than the finished product.",The Souvenir

And the initial situation she found herself in draws your immediate sympathy. But none of the other characters were written at all well, and only came alive when the actor (Tilda Swinton, Richard Ayowade) did all of the heavy lifting. I never felt the emotions of any other character, including that of the second lead. I don't blame the actors; I don't think the writer/director had any interest in anyone except the lead.After we establish the initial situation, there is no story arc at all. Things happen, but nothing ever changes. The direction was detached and clinical. The dialog in the early party scenes were impossible to make out. The camerawork was static and murky -- except in some early party scenes when it seemed garish and overexposed. I don't know if these camera decisions were deliberate and ill-advised or just amateurish. All in all, this movie felt much longer than its actual running time.",The Souvenir

The way that people in the film reacts to the situations their presented in are good given their pre established unnatural sensibilities but the characters are still unbelievable and unlikable.

28,qeter,Mistery of life,8,6 July 2020,"The interesting thing with The Souvenir is that after leaving the cinema I would have scored it with 6 stars only. But, I write my reviews always several days after watching a movie to avoid overemphasizing of the new. Usually the score goes down after few days. I think, this is the first movie it went up. Surely, somebody might say a rating should be of the movie only. But I appreciate what a movie does to me, too. And The Souvenir worked a lot on my soul and in my brain for the last four days, after watching. Why? I am not sure. I guess, because Hogg produced art, how art should be. A mix of beauty, irritation, space for interpretation, moral openness, different views from different angles. Who is the victim, who the culprit? Which way round and a-round? Human experience needs its own victims. A bad guy teaches this girl more than a good guy ever could. Does she know that already at the beginning of the relationship? Does she abuse him? I think, she does, in a way. But how guilty is she, by doing it? How guilty I am myself by abusing people's emotion towards me? Is it possible not to abuse our family and friends? We have only one life. The Souvenir shows our curiosity to break out into life, if we dare. If you decide to go for it - go for the best cinema around with the highest audio quality. Best, go alone. You will need every part of your body to open all your senses. Let yourself not be drawn into lack of interest.

29,nikxatz,"A really gentle, heartfelt and personal film with a lot of emotion and gentleness.",7,4 December 2019,"""The Souvenir"" was the first movie I got to watch at the 60th Thessaloniki Film Festival, which tok place from 31st of October till 10th of November at my hometown, Thessaloniki in Greece. I had a great time and form now on I will start reviewing each film I had the chance to watch.
""The Souvenir"" is a really personal film that is able to create authnetic emotions through its performances, its magestic cinemotgraphy and atmosphere, its gentle asthetique and its realistic and memoir-like story. Its basically about the life of a woman as she goes to film school while having a relationship with a troubled and ethically-questionable man.The whole film has a great asthetque and style. It is filled with astounding shots of England and the lighting is really stylish and gives a comfy feeling. Plus, cigarettes are immesurably cinematique and I feel that the whole film is really detailed and well done when it comes to its look. The collection of 80's tracks add to the film a lot and give a more energetic note, I obviously wanted more songs.The interesting hting about the script is that it is more or less the sotry of the director's (Joanna Hogg) early years, when she strugled to balance her passion and work for the film school and the feeling of love and care she has for a mysterious but elegant man. We really get to feel how the character/director was feeling at those time and his lover for her is always questioned. He is a really sweet and sympathetic guy on the surface and I felt like I got why the main character liked him so much, but at times he is also really manipulative and he self-destructive and their relationships takes interesting turns.She, from the other side, is really caring and does everything she can to satisfy his needs, but at certain points in the film she is so blind and feels like she is the wrong one, shile she has actually done nothing. I actually felt that this trait of her was really far-fetched, so that she was really reckless at times that she was saying sorry for no reason and it felt kind of funny. i amn I get that it is her story, but it is difficutl to believe that someone has to be so nice to forgive everything the other does. Okay, it is understood, but still it is weird.Their bond is toxic and the man hold the balance of power, but it finally makes for a bittersweet ride with my favourite moment the one where they have a lovely quarrel about the space each one has in the bed.I also really liked the dialogue in the film. The whole movie is a a combination of short conversations about a variety of themes. The characters feel real and I love the energy their exchanges have. I liek when the couple talk about why she wants to become a director and he says if she ever feels that she must become that and sher just wants to find a way to express herself or other conversaitons about film schools and I can go on and on... they really immersed me in the story.The last act feels like a fading memory, it gets more gloomy but offers for a great cinematic experience about love, life, death, the realisation of being able to express, understand and control emotions. Its execuiton is one from the heart of Joanna Hogg, who was present in the screeening and got to share what was it like turning her life into film. I disagree to this film being self-important and narcissistic, but i can see why soem found it so. If you let yourself to be a part of the universe, then i you will probably enjoy it.I myself found it a little bit too long, I would probably prefer it to be 20c minutes shorter, but that doesn't mean I was bored by it at any meeans. i wil definately check out the sequel and I am excited to watch what else Joanna wants to explore. She seemed like a really kind and honest person and i cannot wait to see more her life unfold.Brilliant performances ( Tilda and her daughter who plays the protsagonist shine and Frankie Wilson was really good and consistent), great cinematoghy a vivid soundtrack and a moving, honest story from an honest person.",The Souvenir

31,realalexrice,Be a bit more open-minded,9,8 June 2021,"Quite discouraged by the majority of people who aren't in the profession of ""critic"" that are finding this to be a self-indulgent piece of filmmaking. Critics are no better or different really than any other person, but I can't imagine putting myself out there like Joanna Hogg has here and receiving a scathing look from audiences. Not every moment in here is light or fast-paced and not every decision Julie makes seems justifiable, but the film is human and real at it's core. Honor Swinton-Byrne is fantastic as Julie and as the heart of the movie, she really shines and feels like a genuine person I could run into at college or even just on the street. She gives the film a really sweet air anytime that she is onscreen and it makes the film have a gentleness to it that I don't think any other actor would be able to bring. The film has a certain timeless feel to it and if it weren't for a few pop songs in the soundtrack, the film would feel completely transcendent of time I think. This story has so much to it, I'm fascinated to see what Hogg does with Part II of this. The lack of open-mindedness in the general reception of this film is disheartening to say the least and while this movie is wildly inspiring on many levels, I have to realize everything isn't always for everyone.",The Souvenir

For some the movie might be slow paced but there was no minute passing by where I felt uninterested. Loved the characters, the actors and especially the writing and the direction.Tilda shines as always and the story, directing, music and editing style are superb. But Honor Swinton (also in real live the daughter of Tilda) is the heart and soul of this film, her acting was as masterful as her mother's!The film is set in 80s London, and is loosely based on Hogg's own memoirs and experiences as a young film student. It is one of the most personal films I have ever seen, almost as if the director's thoughts and memories were somehow visualized and brought into pictures.

33,babybuletgani,When we first meet Julie,10,7 December 2019,"When we first meet Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne, daughter of Tilda Swinton, who plays her mum in the film), she's living in Knightsbridge in the early 1980s - a 24-year-old film student putting together a debut feature set in the shipyards of Sunderland. A well-meaning pursuit, but does her eagerness to pop her own bubble of privilege give her the right to appropriate such a story? It's a question that she's at least aware of.
Julie's professors, all men, frown at her every suggestion - among many other things, The Souvenir touches, with surgical precision, upon the silencing of women in the arts - and she likewise receives pointed feedback from Anthony (Tom Burke), with whom she falls in love after meeting at a party. Anthony works for the Foreign Office. Older than Julie, he seems impossibly sophisticated and exotically world-weary. He also, thrillingly, sees Julie, though he's frequently condescending and at times utterly contemptuous.
The above synopsis doesn't begin to express the complexity of the character portrayals and the relationship dynamic, with Byrne and Burke peeling back layers to startle at every turn. These surprises are not movie surprises - a Keyser Söze reveal, say - but organic, and all the more mesmerising for it. Masks slip, moods shift, and secrets and lies bubble to the surface as life pushes and pulls. Nearly all of the action is set indoors (most of it in Julie's apartment, which is closely modelled on Hogg's own at the time), and the toxicity spreads to every corner, making it hard to breathe. Not at the expense of nuance, though, with love and sympathy never lost in the mix.
Like Hogg's three previous films (Unrelated, Archipelago, Exhibition), the souvenir wrestles with questions of class and Englishness, while the politics of the time informs the frame. At one point Julie's flat shakes to the sound of an unseen blast - the IRA bombing of Harrods in 1983. It is not by chance, however, that one discussion between Julie and Anthony brings up the movies of Powell and Pressburger. Like those classics, The Souvenir swerves on-thenose message-making and defies easy categorisation. It's a strikingly personal drama that captures a time and a nation. Watch it and you'll be gagging for the sequel that Hogg is currently making.",The Souvenir

Did she love him? Who was giving her the money--her mother or her grandmother? Did she even have a grandmother? Did the girl have two floors in her apartment?

36,nehpetstephen,Is this supposed to be satire?,2,10 June 2019,"My husband and I drove twenty miles to see this movie, and we were excited to see Tilda Swinton in what was currently ranked as the second-highest-rated movie of 2019 on Metacritic. We had noticed that the user reviews on RottenTomatoes, Metacritic, and Google were extremely low--completely at odds with the glowing critics' reviews--but I convinced him that it was probably a result of some 4chan or Reddit campaign--i.e., a bunch of misogynist snowflakes freaking out over a movie directed by a woman and launching anti-feminist screeds against a movie they hadn't even seen. Because I think that may in fact be happening, I feel the need to attest here that I myself am not an anti-feminist Reddit lunatic with an ax to grind. I feel the need to also insist that I am not an impatient philistine who can't appreciate good art. I think the following fact will help to make both of those claims clear: one of my all-time favorite movies, which I've seen and savored three times, is the 225-minute-long feminist masterpiece Jeanne Dielman, 23 Commerce Quay, 1080 Brussels, directed by Chantal Akerman with an almost all female crew, in which extremely long (like, 8+ minutes), static, nearly silent shots of a woman doing her housework over the course of 48 hours document an extremely gripping and powerfully moving statement about modern oppression. If that's sufficient evidence to prove that I'm not a troll, then trust me when I tell you that The Souvenir is truly awful.I almost never check my phone while I'm at the movie theater, but after what seemed like an eternity, I peeked in my pocket to check the time. I figured this breach of etiquette was fine; there were only six other people in the theater besides my husband--a party of five old women in the front row, and a young man several seats to my right who was quietly snoring throughout most of the movie. I was shocked when I saw that only 80 minutes had passed--meaning that 40 more remained. At that point, I considered walking out, but my hope was that some whopper of an ending would rack everything into focus and create a wallop of an impact. Nope. The ending is, in fact, the very worst and most pretentious part of the film.The acting is technically all fine, as is all the craftsmanship (cinematography, sound mixing, etc.). But what on earth is the point? On the drive home, I found myself trying to argue to my husband (who also hated it) that perhaps it was all satire. The main character is thoroughly uninteresting, extremely naive, and at times outright obnoxious. She's a young woman of unmistakable privilege (her mother lives in a castle, essentially) who wants to make a movie about poor struggling dockworkers living in a town she's only visited on a couple of occasions. In several scenes, she tries to articulate what she wants to do with her filmmaking; while these scenes are certainly very realistic insofar as they capture the cliched sentiment of a budding undergrad bourgeois artist who has nothing to say but demands the right to say it, they aren't terribly scintillating. If they're supposed to make us see that this young woman is talented and passionate, then they achieved the exact opposite effect for me, which is why I found myself wondering if it was a satire. At one point, a professor asks her if her art is motivated by some political (i.e., Marxist?) drive, she fumblingly states that yes, she wants to experience other cultures outside of her privileged bubble by directing and writing (i.e. ventriloquizing) stories in a voice she knows nothing about. In that same scene, a character tells her that she should probably just write from within her own experience...Which is interesting because that's precisely the film that The Souvenir is. Instead of making a film about the cliched miseries of downtrodden dockworkers, Hogg has instead made a film about how the fabulously wealthy are also les miserables and how they, too, bleed when you prick them with either snide remarks about how privileged they are or a heroin syringe. There are multiple scenes set at film school, in which nameless characters are filming what looks like absolute garbage--women in bad costumes sitting on stools reciting nineteenth-century poetry to the camera, etc. No context whatsoever is given for these numerous scenes. In what scene, they have the most asinine conversation about what a great feat of cinema the shower scene from Psycho is. Again, is this satire? Are we supposed to think that these are pretentious blowhards making art despite having nothing to say? Or are we supposed to pretend that these scenes are actually interesting?The first forty minutes or so contain some mildly interesting scenes which suggest that the main conflict will be a more subtle story about toxic masculinity. My first impression was that the male love interest was there simply to poke holes in the female protagonist's self-esteem--that, basically, this would be a story about a negative nihilist trying to destroy a younger woman's hopes and dreams for no particular reason. Unfortunately, midway through the film it's revealed that the conflict is far more stereotypical than that, and once the true conflict is revealed, it becomes utterly predictable and completely uninteresting. I don't want to spoil much, but there's a long, tedious, pointless scene late in the film in which the protagonist's father (or maybe her stepfather / mother's boyfriend... I couldn't tell) speculates about what classes he would take if he were to take college courses in his retirement (""I don't know... perhaps land management....? Then again, I was always interested in history.... So maybe history...."") Again, I had to wonder if this film was devious, trenchant satire--if, contrary to the film's ostensible message, it was in fact trying to argue that we should all just give up on life and become drug addicts. This film is so mind-numbingly tedious that it certainly makes opioid addiction seem like a viable life choice.The biggest shock for me was that they're making a sequel. I would sooner pay someone to administer a drug overdose to me than sit through that. This movie might strike a chord with you if you yourself are bourgeois, vapid, and feel that life is generally just one big waste of idle time . But might I suggest you go to a wine bar instead?",The Souvenir
37,Floki_Thorfinn,The souvenir of The Souvenir is: A Dreadful Experience.,1,12 August 2019,"A self-destructive relationship acted by a talentless Honor Swinton Byrne and a listless Tom Burke, is the detonator in this prosaic autobiography of writer/director Joanna Hogg (Based on her personal diary of her film student days in the 80's), which lurks in inane stillness, rather than in awe and poignancy.This mosaic of ridiculously short scenes, close-ups of titles in a typewriter, political references, unanswered questions and the main character's unappealing film making shots, wakes a notion of the auteur's self-awareness of nostalgia, yet, for the misfortune of the audience, the film never actually unravels a vaguely sense of relevance, nor esthetically nor in the script.¿You ever heard people say about a bad movie: ""The only good thing about it was when it ended?, well, here ain't the occasion, nor even that.

41,deager,Hey Why Don't You Come Over & Watch Our Vacation Slides,5,18 June 2019,"Let me get this out of the way first - just because Tom Burke, Honor Swinton Byrne & Tilda Swinton do a excellent job (the reason for a 5 & not a 3) in this movie (even though Tilda Swinton is little used) doesn't mean that its great. The cinematography is good (though a bit washed out, but that could be on purpose based on the total lack of tension in this movie, so why have anything but pastel hues?); the direction I found to very good (even though Joanna Hogg, working from her own script) loves wide framing that seems to collapse on close encounters. The script though is just a lot of talking, talking, talking that seems to be leading us nowhere. Scene after scene of conversation that is all very nice but has little purpose. The only person who has anything interesting or useful is Anthony (Tom Burke). Julie (Honor Swinton Burke) seems to be so unaware that it gets very tedious watching her sleepwalk through this mess. (I have yet to understand the title ""The Souvenir"" as it relates to the story. I give guesses but the might be spoilers)

(The movie starts!) (No offense to the great states of Kansas & Nebraska, but you are flat!). This movie builds no tension between its characters, it does nothing but shows a day in the life of a slick, maneuvering man & a woman who has no sense of the world around her & is a prime enabler. Is it about her blind love for him. Is it about his manipulation of her. Is it about her lack of knowledge of...of...well basically everything. I kept hoping this movie would do something, would go somewhere, would show us something that we could care about (especially regarding Julie) but it never did, it just kept wandering and wandering to the expected conclusion with a closing shot (reminiscent of the final shot on The Searchers, although I am sure it was not on purpose).

It feels like its playing it safe and doesn't want to do anything with these devices. The acting was bland, both leads felt so stoned faced and unlikable throughout the movie and the times where they did actually convey some emotion were some of the best parts to the film. There were also a number of pointless scenes that felt extremely frustrating because they would explore these encounters in favour of the more emotional and gripping scenes of the film. I was quite hooked in the beginning of the film because it felt like it was building the dominoes up to a point where everything would get knocked down and I suppose it happens to some extent but not in the way that makes you care.The only positive I can give this film is that it is well shot and some of the cinematography is nice but nothing spectacular.Overall, I was extremely disappointed in the souvenir the bland acting, colour palette, and story made this firstly the most boring film of the year as well as one of my least favourites of the year.

I LOVED Unrelated and Archipelago and I think Tilda Swinton is a wonderful performer. I hated Exhibition however. This is not as bad as Exhibition. Having worked with the situations depicted in the film, the depiction does not ring true. Honor Swinton Byrne is Ok but she never illuminates her character and choices sufficiently to be believable. Burke's portrayal makes his character so off-putting from the start that its hard to believe in the romance at any point. He (or the script) also telegraphs his issues so blatantly that its jarring that we are never really shown Julie's (presumably) growing realization of her situation and the consequences of her choices. Did her mother know? Thats never clear. Was the final phone call a double revelation to the mother ? Given the situation, not understanding the mother-daughter take on it is very unsatisfying.

There's so much going on in the background of the action: you can overhear interesting conversations between background characters, the rooms change in ways that tell their own stories, the main character has a whole never-mentioned battle with her nail-biting habit which (also never explicitly) annoys her mother... All of these subtle and meticulously executed details make the world of the story feel fully fleshed-out and real. Honor Swinton Byrne has to be lauded for her understated and raw performance, which all the other actors are in sync with.At the intellectual level, the film maintains a couple of important conversations, with varying degrees of subtlety: the journey of finding one's artistic voice and dealing with one's privilege. The latter, the conversation on privilege, is something that stayed with me because it's particularly topical but also really interesting: can people who come from privilege create and talk about/on behalf of the underprivileged? Does privilege prevent them from a deeper understanding of life's big questions? Is their relationship with the underprivileged doomed to be exploitative / caught in the ""observer's paradox""?OK so: specific artistic goal - check, interesting themes - check. Is this it?Emotionally, this film does nothing. Nada. I felt exactly zero feels while watching it.One big factor is how simultaneously boring and irritating the second main character, Anthony (the main character's love interest) is. His pretentiousness and disingenuity is made obvious from his first minute on-screen. The protagonist supposedly falls deeply in love with him, although it's not clear how/at what point (which makes us unable to follow that emotional journey) and all we wait for throughout the film is for her to wake up and break it off. But then we don't care enough about her either, not enough to shout at the screen ""snap out of it girl!"", not least because we suspect she's in it out of some romantic, if not selfish, idea that the emotional torture is her way out of the blind spots that come with her privilege which, in turn, will lead to more authentic artistic expression.The rest of the relationships are just dry: the mother-daughter relationship is emotionally repressed (a British upper class stereotype), the relationships between the protagonist and her friends are completely uninteresting, despite all the realism.So yeah, the film ticks many boxes when it comes to artistic merit and food for thought, but it completely starves the viewers of any emotions. Is this worth rewarding as high art? Is this really what ""the best film of 2019"" should be like?",The Souvenir
45,kylerafa,A Bad Souvenir for me!,4,4 December 2019,"First of all, I am sure ""The Souvenir"" was good to a lot of people. I mean, if it got 92/100 on Metacritic and ended up in the year-end lists of so many reviewers, it's for something.
Now, I'll be frank, I didn't finish it. It was sooo slow and so painful to watch. I gave it a chance After watching the first 30 min but then, I was so bored, yawning every minute I think. I can understand the depth of the picture, and for people saying what's the point? The point is clear, the message is clear (Love is blind somehow) but told with so much darkness and a horrific storytelling. I mean, it's like this film was voluntarily done to bore the audience, to ""force"" them to think about the plot. For some other pictures, it works, but it didn't for this one (to me).
That said, actings from the 2 main characters are fabulous. Cinematography is OK. Costume design and soundtrack as well (you were really into the 80s watching it) but ... UGH! It was not for me, unfortunately.",The Souvenir
46,kvatter,"Move on folks, nothing to see here",2,3 October 2019,"While the reviewer, Deager, has beautifully summed up this film (and I recommend reading it), I would just add that this film is pure mental masturbation for the writer/director. Two more uninteresting characters could not be conjured even from the mind of a corpse. You truly wouldn't care if they vanished mid-way through this film. Staring at the various exterior shots of tree tops throughout this film would be more interesting. As a poke in the eyes of the viewers who manage to make it to the end, the lead character is actually making an equally tedious film that we are supposed to believe is deep art. Ignore the critic reviews because this emperor has no clothes OR skin.
Update: Ladies and Gentlemen, I just finished watching Lucky with Harry Dean Stanton and more happens within the first 3 minutes than happens in all of The Souvenir. AND it is better directed, better acted, has characters we actually care about and expresses emotion. It makes me hate The Souvenir and it's ice cold, emotionless, drivel with dept. store mannequins for characters even MORE. That they are making a part two of Souvenir is astounding.

48,almiraomerovic,Snoozefest,2,19 April 2020,"This was one of those films that I was so ready to like, but I just really didn't, and I felt kind of gaslit by all the glowing reviews.It was gorgeously, wonderfully shot, and I did pick up on the intricacies of the romance and I did enjoy the poignance of the ending. My main problem was that everyone was just so unlikeable. I found it incredibly hard to relate to anyone, especially the two main characters. I never once picked up on anything that Antony did that made him worthwhile to be around; he was simply pompous and awful. Is that the point? Sure, maybe but even in those brief moments where he was 'ok' he was still so dreadful as a person that it couldn't possibly outshine anything so much as it weighed down his nauseating character even more.Julie was one of my least favorite portrayals of 'the artist' in media recently. If this is the type of person who exemplifies the struggles of the artist, God help us as a species because there will be nothing produced worth remembering. I never got a sense of drive whatsoever, that she ever even wanted to be producing art - it all felt like another dollop of privilege on top of what she already had. Sure, the film pointed that out, but they didn't do anything about it. All of her classmates seemed more preoccupied with art than she did, and that made them more compelling in their brief turns on screen. In stories about artists there are layers - the way their real-world emotional and social lives and relationships inform and intertwine with the art they produce can make for engaging narratives, as revelations can come in many forms. But what are we to make of a character, then, who is an artist, but seems to not think about art at all? Are we supposed to align with and see suffering in the 'tortured artist' even when it seems she couldn't care less about art?
I couldn't help but feel like Julie's overwhelming disagreeability, lack of motivation, and her general petty issues were a massive miss for the concept of a female filmmaker on screen in the current day and age. Films about making films aren't always hits, but when they are, it's because they are coursing with passion, which I just did not feel here at all.I'll be honest, I was a little shocked by how much I disliked this film. It's rare for me to have such a negative reaction, especially about something that on the surface seems so up my alley. Part of me wonders what I missed here, because obviously the rest of the educated film world loved it. But what is it? I was prepared to relate to the characters. I went to film school, know people like Antony and Julie. I know people who are addicts and swing back and forth between emotions that make them hard to predict and harder to live with. I know people who are stuck in relationships that seem so obvious when you're on the outside. All of these people are exciting, interesting, fun to be around, tragic and frightening in their own ways. They feel real,but no one in this film, to me, even barely approached feeling real, and the narrative crumbled as soon as I realized it.",The Souvenir

As this movie went on I was amazed that it maintained such a high level of watchability. All the characters are fascinating and I found their portrayal interesting and original. (brilliant casting btw)
Half way through watching I tried to think of other movies that it reminded me of. This was difficult because it really is quite unique. One that did cross my mind was 'Exhibition' because it had a similar effect on me...I only found out afterwards that it is also by Joanna Hogg. Go Jo!

53,Gilly-13,"I had to ""solve"" this film, but it was worth it.",8,24 October 2019,"Like many, I was bored and confused after viewing ""The Souvenir"", but I had recently watched and liked Joanna Hogg's ""Unrelated"" (2007), so I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought it over. Like some other reviewers, something came to me the next day.
I'm not a ""feeling"" kind of guy, so I have to work to appreciate her method of getting across an emotional complex and the way she will use the whole film to lead to a pinpoint, deep-drill moment of emotional elucidation.
In ""The Souvenir"", I came to think she was portraying Julie as a sort of emotional vampire, vicariously using the troubled life of her lover, Anthony, to fill in the blanks of her previously vapid, upper-middle-class existence--borrowing some misery to give her enough empathy to be able to relate to less fortunate beings in order to fulfill her artistic ambition to be a filmmaker.
The hints are there: her frustrated attempt at a working-class documentary; the advice from more than one source, to work from her own experience--the thing she lacks; her insincere credulity at finding needlemarks on Anthony's arm (you were right, nobody is THAT naive), and again when her flat is ransacked; her blind eye to where he goes with the money he borrows from her--an employee of the British foreign office borrowing constantly from a no-income film student.
It occurred to me that this was the reason Joanna Hogg gave Honor Swynton Byrne her journals and materials from that time instead of a script in order to keep the actress as naive and unaware of her own motives as Hogg, herself, must have been at that age in this semi-autobiographical study.
Then there was the extended discussion of the murder scene in ""Psycho"". The iconic portrayal of a brutal stabbing without any depiction of the actual physical violence. Julie says little, but has the last word in the discussion, (from memory) ""You don't see the actual killing, but you see the end result.""
Congruently, you don't see Anthony's death, but the end results: the news of his overdose in the bathroom of an art gallery and the lack of remorse on Julie's part, contrasted with the excellent expression of grief by Tilda Swynton, the enormously talented mother of the character, as well as the actress,.
And then the solution came to me when I rememberd the ""Joanna Hogg moment""--that magnificent shot where Swynton Byrne turns her concentration from directing a film--the attainment of her film student goal--and glares impassively, directly, and most un-naively into Joanna Hogg's camera.
Now, we all knew that was meant to be very cinematically significant, but I honestly didn't understand the significance until I solved the rest of the movie--that final, unblinking glare at the audience was Julie saying, ""Yeah, I'm an upper class brat, and I got what I wanted. TFB if my junkie boyfriend died.""
And that realization with the memory of the defiant glare from her pallid, emotionless face made my blood run cold just as my mail carrier plucked the DVD from my mailbox the next day.
I won't watch it again, but I recommend that the bored and confused give it some reconsideration.",The Souvenir
54,nesdon-2,Obvious and inscrutable,4,31 May 2019,"This film seems to be trying to turn its back on every narrative tradition. It shows us so much, and lingers so long on so many shots and scenes that are utterly unilluminating of any plot or character, and leaves out almost every detail that might help us contextualize what is going on or who these people are.I love Malick, and really appreciate the heuristic style he pioneered. I'm glad when directors don't point at everything and instead let an audience just have an experience. But I, at least, need more than was offered here, where the arcs of all the characters seeming punctuated and unmotivated, and the mise-en-scene mostly arbitrary.I didn't find the cinematography gorgeous at all, it seemed just like whatever was there, often flat and muddy, only occasionally catching a nice bit of light.Maybe a little spoiler here (I guess?) but the last shot reprives a repeating shot, held painfully long, that I guess was intended as chapter markings, reminiscent of the brilliant wide shots that broke up Breaking The Waves, but which seemed completely empty of any meaning, even after that final reprise.Without 2 Swintons, this film would never have gotten a theatrical release.",The Souvenir

The man character at least is understandable as a manipulator. The girl character is just out, she reacts with no logic and not even understandably emotionally. Just out of the plot, of the facts, the happenings.
It could have been a movie about the psychological or psychiatric reactions of a lost minded person, unfortunately the story doesn't tell you anything about that.

63,dennis-11345,Art isn't anecdote. It's the consciousness we bring to bear on our lives. - Cheryl Strayed,10,25 May 2019,"Unbearably sad and, as usual for me, fresh feeling emerges the next morning. I have never seen such a ... let's say ""delicate"" ... way of unfolding a story. (I felt a similar delicacy, and indeterminacy, in Bi Gan's Long Day's Journey Into Night.) It's like watching a monk doing Zen brush drawing: a touch of the brush here, a breath of the brush there: it all seems like it isn't going anywhere or adding up to anything, and it even starts seeming borderline incoherent, or borderline ugly. Until you step back and take in the whole. I hunger for the director's level of sensitivity: as if anything that comes from the mind is secondary and almost nothing at all comes from the everyday desire to paint a ""relatable"" character or tell an ""exciting"" story. Seems like she is coming from some very deep place. Makes me want to inhabit her through her film. I'll try again tonight.Second viewing.
She inhabits her film in a unique way, breathing into it a host of feelings: subtle, unnameable, flickering, perhaps transcendent. Summaries, like the one in Metacritic, are fine, but I don't think she made the film primarily because she wanted to tell that story. Her visual and narrative interests go far beyond character and story-telling. But how to describe this...? At some fundamental level, isn't this more about being with others? Or love?Third viewing.
For me, her energy and freshness are definitely in the ""feeling"" track. Here's one aspect of it: in this film, the first of a two-part series, almost every discussion and almost every setting is suffocating or dissatisfying, to some degree. The antidotes are the walk with the dogs through the countryside and the recurring image ""trees with sky,"" which acquires the look of a painting. So part of the creative challenge in Part 1 is how to express that lack of connection -- and many other feelings -- without clichés of any kind. Letting feelings stay at the level of feeling.",The Souvenir

If ""long day's journey into night' was like a fifties European existentialist art film on quasudes, the Souvenir was like Long day's journey slowed down to 1/4speed. Nothing happened but it happened very slowly. I think the script writer hit it perfectly in the beginning of the movie in some advice to the young film student protagonist. No, don't make it like real life. Real life is far too slow and without event. You have to cut and paste and choose which pieces to leave in and which pieces to not bother with or you end up with something totally boring. Yet they all went on to make this film which had realistic characters who basically did nothing interesting at any point.How both this and Long Day's Journey earned such effusive praise from critics of all stripes is beyond me.

The person you love will always be the most charming and kind, even when they're not.The Souvenir tells a story about a privileged film student who involves herself in an intense relationship with a shady older man, who is full of charisma.I can definitely see why this film is getting mixed ratings. The pacing was rather slow and the story was under-dramatized. I see a lot of reviewers really disliking this film due to the unbearable toxic romance between the two characters. I mean, I can somewhat agree. Seriously, just break up already! But sometimes relationships are just... like that. People often stay in toxic situations even if they can clearly see the red flags. People cling on to the slightest glisten of hope when everything is falling apart. As they say, it really... do be like that.I loved the cinematic direction they took in this film. I felt like I was looking into the memories of the protagonist. The faded dream-like colour scheme really pulls the film together. I was really lured into the soft pastel universe that was created on screen. Did I mention how much I loved the cinematics?What I couldn't see past was how unlikeable Julie and Anthony are. Julie is a privileged film student that tries really hard to be interesting, and Anthony is this pretentious, manipulative douchebag of a person. I just can't seem to find any redeeming qualities in the characters, which makes it hard for me to fully connect with this story. But maybe this film wasn't made for the viewer to be connected to any of the characters. Maybe this film was made to be consumed as what it is. A naive girl falling in love with a secretive older man.Nevertheless, The Souvenir really made me sit and ponder about the film a lot.

The film school teacher even points that out (""..living in Knightsbridge..."").Julie's character is fragile and insecure, seeking love in an even more insecure and fragile drug addict. It is 100% plausible to me and I think the performance was very good. Also, Anthony points that out to her, that he thinks she is fragile, it is at a point in the movie where it doesn't make sense, but in the end it all falls together to one piece..The movie is slow-paced and moody, something that I really liked about it.. you should bring some time.. if you expect Hollywood-action you should see something else.",The Souvenir

Living in London going to film school and meeting a slightly older man who is sophisticated charming and deceptive. It avoids many of the tropes of the young junkie romance because in the film's dissonant narrative it shows how baffling confusing drug addiction is by those who have addicts in their lives. I like that this film doesn't glamorize addiction and hypocritically disavow it as many film about addiction do. Instead we have a narrative that is sad and confusing as real life is under these circumstances",The Souvenir
87,SGMidence,Please have some respect for your audience's time investment,4,17 November 2020,"This is one of those slow, meandering, navel-gazing arthouse dramas that makes me think that, even if you lack any sense whatsoever of how to tell a story on film, as long as you have the right festival and distributor connections and can hire some competent actors and a camera crew, you, too, can become an acclaimed indie auteur.Let me ask you this: were there any actual *scenes* in this? Or merely collections of shots discontinuous in time and space?At one point, Richard Ayoade's character says to the protagonist: ""I mean, you know the Tolstoy definition of art? Well, you just have a feeling, and by means of external signs you communicate it to someone else.""When you make a film, you have to use filmic techniques to convey the characters' thoughts and feelings to the viewer. *Those* are the ""external signs"" that communicate your intended meaning to the audience. You can't just point a camera at some actors' (mostly improvised) mumbling and droning and expect us to ""get it.""I have to imagine that a not-insignificant portion of the viewers who did enjoy the movie only did so because they, too, attended film school and/or fell in love with a toxic, uncharismatic individual at some point in their young adulthood. But the power inherent in cinema, or really any kind of art, is that it can convey things that I *haven't* personally experienced and make me empathize with them nonetheless. When a piece of art fails to do that - especially a feature film, with its vast possibilities for visual and aural stimuli and the extended focus and attention it demands of the viewer - I can't help but think that the artist has failed at their goal.",The Souvenir

100,sofiapeeters,Poetic and subtle memoir that is deeply felt,10,23 September 2019,"""We don't wanna just see life played out as is. We wanna see life as it is experienced, within this soft machine.""Where to start: I adore this film.
It's best going into it knowing as little as possible, so I won't talk about the plot here. The reason for this is that it's a memoir and so you learn alongside the main character, Julie.Since you follow the story through Julie's eyes, or rather, the creator's memories, a very welcoming mystery element is brought to the film. Not everything about others and surroundings is clear, just like it isn't in one's own life. A couple of parts even felt dreamlike -the way scenes were out of sequence then- and that really added to making it feel like a memory piece.The film itself is very simple in its story, yet complicated and layered in its monologues and dialogues. It is almost next level poetry at times. Every word, every shot in the film has a meaning, and all the little revelations are slowly build up and ultimately tied together, creating a very cohesive end product.Julie is a very down-to-earth character, she feels so natural, this young woman in her mid-twenties, struggling, as people of this age often do, with who she wants to be, in this case in terms of an artist. Honor Swinton Byrne effortlessly managed to make Julie the most sympathetic person.Tom Burke is phenomenal as Anthony, showing so much depth and yet keeping so much hidden at the same time. It is all in his eyes, and his voice gives every word intricate nuances and meaning.This film is so subtle, that if you don't pay attention, you will miss the whole point of the film. It creeps up on you, this film, and that is why it hit me so hard in the end, and why I fell for it right from the start. Joanna Hogg did a marvelous job. Less is more, that is shown perfectly by this masterpiece.",The Souvenir

102,edwardm-5,Fine acting but thin on storyline.,4,15 March 2021,"Top of 'Sight and Sounds' best 50 movies of 2019, this semi autobiographical tale from its writer and director is the winner of numerous awards and loved by the critics, and I thought I was onto a winner here. But hmmm...I knew that trailer would mislead me.It started off torpidly, and never really picked up any pace. It's one of those movies where little happens whilst the story unfolds, but there is always the feeling that something dramatic is about to happen, so you stick with it in the hope that it does. Don't hold your breath.Things do happen, but not in a particularly dramatic way and coming in at a running time of two hours is simply ridiculous; edit half an hour out, it would make no difference to the story and would provide a better experience for the viewer. Why director Joanna Hogg allowed the editor to cut the movie in this way is unfathomable; there isn't enough in this story or its characters to justify its extended screen time.The two main characters are bland and boring with little to say to each other or anyone else, but maybe that's the point of the entire movie and that's why it's incredibly boring at times? To emphasise the mundanity of their lives whilst trying to engender some unattainable spark into a tedious relationship? If so, it worked.Some fine acting by the two leads, but particularly from Honor Swinton Byrne who hadn't been allowed to read the script and improvised all her lines, get lost in the utter tediousness and slow pace this movie dawdles along at; the cinematography is excellent and it perfectly captures the period when the story is set, but its overall lack of dynamism and repetitiveness which laboured a point that had already been made, ultimately damages it.'Souvenir II' is currently in post production and will be out next year, so that's something to look forward to eh?And I shall have to make sure that I read Mark Kermode's review of it, and if he raves about it as much as he did 'The Souvenir' then I'll give it a wide berth as I should have done with this one.",The Souvenir

The director seems to have gone out of her way to do stuff that doesn't work - but it does - people talking off screen, shots not properly focussed etc.The script was like real life - mumbling, people talking over each other, lots of ums and incoherence - we are so attuned to snappy interactions in most scripts that we forget how unreal most dialogue is in what we watchThe parents were remarkable characters - so carefully written, and beautifully performedIt captured gloriously the daggy early 80's - the earnestness and the idealismThe sets / art direction were probably the highlight - for example, the way the camera used the mirrors in their flat to express a range of emotional statesSome sumptuous tableau cinematography, particularly in the restaurant scenes; reminded me of Peter Greenaway's workThe use of period music as a coda between sections - whilst in the majority of scenes there was no music at all, which meant the actors needed to do all the workThe performances were uniformly excellent - particularly Honor Swinton Burke who was translucent in her vulnerabilityAs a final point, loved the cameos by the jadied marxist academics sucking on their cigarettes as they planned the revolution which never cameI admit to being pretentious, and as such found this exceptional.

Perhaps it's not as great as the critics are saying - the film school plot is rather dull and doesn't go anywhere until the final scene.
