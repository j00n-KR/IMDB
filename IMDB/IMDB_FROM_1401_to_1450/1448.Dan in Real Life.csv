0,MartinHafer,Pleasant in an undemanding sort of way...,6,15 May 2011,"My sister-in-law insisted that I needed to see this film, as it was wonderful. Well, don't tell her, but I just thought it was okay--an agreeable sort of film but nothing more. Now this is not a terrible thing--a romantic film is hard to find. But don't expect much more.The film begins with when you see Dan(Steve Carell) and his three daughters preparing to go to a family get-together. You see that his two oldest daughters have conflicts--the oldest wants to drive and the youngest wants to date but is mistaking an infatuation with love. There is no mother, as apparently she died four years ago.Soon after, Carell meets a nice lady at the bookstore (Juliet Binoche) and is smitten. It's obvious that this infatuation is meant as a parallel to the young daughter's infatuation. But, as this is a romantic-comedy, Carell's infatuation turns out to be love by the end of the film. But there is a problem--she turns out to be his brother's girlfriend. While there is more to the film than this, there isn't much. Carell is infatuated with a lady who his brother loves as well.Overall, the film is agreeable enough but suffers from a lack of comedy (even with Carell) and also is pretty formulaic. It's not bad--but it's pretty predictable and the chemistry between him and Binoche seems a bit vague.",Dan in Real Life
1,SnoopyStyle,Steve Carell shows more sides to his acting,7,12 October 2013,"Dan Burns (Steve Carell) is a lonely widow who writes an advice columnist. He is overprotective and over his head especially with boy crazy Cara (Britt Robertson). He can't even teach his oldest Jane (Alison Pill) how to drive. The family is spending the weekend with the extended family. That's where Dan meets and falls for Marie (Juliette Binoche) at a bookstore. Only later does he find out that she's his brother Mitch (Dane Cook)'s girlfriend.It's a sweet rom-com with a great ensemble cast. Even Dane Cook is good here, and I usually can't stand him. It helps that he's that douche character. Steve Carell is playing a downer character. His depressed angry guy approach is quite an eye opening. Juliette Binoche is her charming self.The inter-family fight do have some awkward moments. The movie's lighter moments and its general whimsical tone can clash violently with those awkward moments. In the end, the movie resolves itself quite well and it ends happily ever after...like there's any other way.",Dan in Real Life
2,claudio_carvalho,Plan to Be Surprised with a Delightful Movie,8,10 March 2009,"The widower family man Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column ""Dan in Real Life"" giving advices for families in The New Jersey Standard and raises his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the older, has just got her driving license but Dan does not allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has a crush on his high-school mate Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) misses her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other. They feel attracted for each other, but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan, giving her phone number first. Dan immediately falls in love for Marie, but when he return to his parent's home, he finds that Marie is the girlfriend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. Along the weekend, the attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to take a decision.""Dan in Real Life"" is a great surprise and a delightful movie, with comedy, romance and drama. The chemistry of the gorgeous Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is awesome and it is very easy to know why everybody loves Marie. The trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston is fantastic and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments of this story. The screenplay is wonderful and the performances of the talented actors and actresses are stunning, with a realistic behavior of a family meeting. Follow the advice of Dan's column and plan to be surprised with the reunion of the Burns' family. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Eu, Meu Irmão e Nossa Namorada"" (""Me, My Brother and Our Girlfriend"")",Dan in Real Life
3,jboothmillard,Dan in Real Life,8,17 July 2010,"I never saw or heard anything about this film during the year it was released, I found out about it when I saw the DVD, I would have guessed it was an independent film, but it wasn't. Dan Burns (Steve Carell) has three daughter and has been widowed for four years, and all the other members of the Burns family are gathering for a vacation on the Rhode Island shore. While in a book store, Dan meets the beautiful Marie (Juliette Binoche) and they decide to go for a meal in a restaurant where he really opens up to her and feels a connection. Even though she is already taken, Marie does give Dan her number and he promises he will call her, and he is really enthusiastic when going to the holiday home. Before Dan tells the whole story, his brother Mitch (Dane Cook) invites his girlfriend in to hear it too, and Dan is shocked and devastated to see that his girlfriend is Marie! Over the weekend of the vacation, Dan finds it really difficult to come to terms with the fact that his brother is dating the woman he has a thing for himself. He is acting vary strangely and his other family members notice this, while Marie is getting to know more about the family members, and find her true feelings. The family try to set him up with a date, that being childhood friend Ruthie Draper (Emily Blunt), and while she is very pretty and likable, Dan can't compare her to Marie. Eventually, there comes a point when Dan and Marie give into their feelings, having a game of bowling and a good kiss, and that is when Mitch and the other family members catch him. After getting a punch in the face from Mitch, and Marie running away, Dan has a real heart to heart with his daughters and not taking enough notice of them. They encourage him to go after Marie, you don't really get a sense of Mitch being okay with it, but he does get with Ruthie, and in the end, Dan and Marie are happily married. Also starring John Mahoney as Poppy Burns, Edward Scissorhands' Dianne Wiest as Nana Burns, Norbert Leo Butz as Clay Burns, Alison Pill as Jane, Brittany Robertson as Cara Burns and Marlene Lawston as Lilly Burns. Carell is both funny and touching as the troubled and love sick father, Binoche is also likable as the woman he desires and sort of vice versa, and the supporting cast are good too. The critics complain this doesn't really represent real life, I disagree with that opinion, I thought it was the sort of situation that could happen, and it makes for a good romantic comedy drama. Very good!",Dan in Real Life
4,ccthemovieman-1,Dan Is A Little TOO Real,4,15 April 2009,"This movie is cool at first but soon becomes SO affected, trying way too hard to sound cool, hip and relaxed, that it gets annoying. The single-dad parent dealing ever-so-Dear Abby-ish with this hormone-ridden young daughters is great at first but quickly wears thin. It's just a little too cute.Yikes, maybe it's just me - a male - repulsed with this Lifetime Network-type chick flick. Maybe you just have to be a parent of three girls to really enjoy this. Since I'm not, I couldn't relate; I only wanted to be entertained with a comedy movie and get a bunch of laughs. As far as romance goes, I'm all for it but not when it's beginnings are built on lies. Hollywood has had this obsession for lying romances since ""talkies"" began about 80 years.Don't get me wrong; this does have entertainment value. The acting is fine; the single father (""Dan Burns,"" played by Steve Carrell) has some great lines to his siblings and to others...but it just seems too contrived. Nobody is this verbally clever as ""real life Dan."" The romance between he and ""Marie"" (Juliette Binoche) also feels not right, and like the dad with his kids, tries too hard to look realistic.Whatever, people will really love or hate this film. You might love it, especially if you can relate to th lead male character and his situation.",Dan in Real Life
5,edwagreen,Dan in Real Life Brings Family Life Home ***,8,8 October 2008,"Steve Carell proves that he is quite an up and coming versatile actor. In this interesting film, he plays a widowed newspaper writer with 3 children. They're invited to his parents' house for a family weekend and mayhem ensues.Obviously, his children are precocious. One already is quite serious with her boyfriend. Dan plays the part of the father all the way by trying to disconnect this relationship.The parents, John Mahoney and the ever talented Dianne Wiest, are given little to do here.This is a story of a man trying to get his life back in shape after the passing of his wife. His family is there to get him to do this never realizing that this will lead Dan to fall for the girlfriend (Juliette Binoche, who won a supporting actress Oscar some years back for ""The English Patient."") of his brother.This is interesting movie fanfare made more enjoyable by the solid chemistry between Carell and Binoche.",Dan in Real Life
6,studioAT,What a charming film,6,23 June 2015,"Sometimes you start watching a film that you're not really sure about. And then it surprises you. This was my experience with 'Dan in Real Life'.I thought this film was wonderful. It is so rare to find a film that mixes so much humour and warmth without being cloying or farcical. But everything about this film clicks both in terms of storytelling and cast. You know you're onto a winner when you have an actor of John Mahoney's quality in a very small role.The fact is that this could happen in real life and the results would probably be much the same as they are on screen. I know some people take the approach of ""I see real life everyday, I go to the cinema to escape it"" but this film is very much a celebration of family life and love and those things are just as important as big budget blockbusters with CGI galore.",Dan in Real Life
7,jotix100,Changing partners,7,23 March 2009,"Dan, the widowed father of three girls, has his own advice column that will probably go into syndication. After his wife's death, he has taken time to raise his daughters. Having known no romance in quite some time, nothing prepares him for the encounter with the radiant Marie, at a local book store in a Rhode Island small town on the ocean, where he has gone to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his big family. After liking Marie at first sight, little prepares him when the gorgeous woman appears at the family compound. After all, she is the date of Dan's brother, Mitch.It is clear from the outset that Dan and Marie are made for one another, and although we sense what the outcome will be, we go for the fun ride that Peter Hedges, the director wants to give us. Mr. Hedges, an author and screenplay writer on his own, has given us two excellent novels, ""What's Eating Gilber Grapes"", and ""An Ocean in Iowa"", and the delightful indie, ""Pieces of April, which he also directed. It's just a coincidence that both movies deal with families during Thanksgiving reunions.The best thing in the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche. Mr. Carell, in fact, keeps getting better all the time. In many ways, he remind us of Jack Lemmon, in his take of comedy and serious material. What can one say about Ms. Binoche, an intelligent actress, and a bright presence in any film. She proves she is right up to doing comedy, convincing us about her Marie.The only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture. John Mahoney, Diane Wiest, Norbert Leo Butz, Jessica Hecht, Emily Blunt, Allison Pill, Amy Ryan, have nothing to do. They just serve as incidental music for decoration. Dane Cook, who is seen as brother Mitch, fares better because he gets to recite more lines than the others.""Dan in Real Life"" is a delightful film that will please everyone.",Dan in Real Life
8,dbborroughs,I liked it. I can't say much more than that,8,5 January 2008,"I'm not a Steve Carell fan however I like this movie about Dan, an advice columnist, who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend. Its a story thats been told before, but not like this. There are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be. The cast is wonderful, and even if Carell is not my cup of tea, he is quite good as the widower who's suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you. At times witty and wise in the way that an annoying Hallmark card can be, the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film. Worth a look see",Dan in Real Life
9,writers_reign,"Dan, In Real Life ...",7,13 January 2008,"... would NEVER have a family like this, Mom, Pop, Siblings, Nephews, Neices and not a single dysfunction between them. This is The Waltons and Little House On The Prairie combined. That being said the central storyline involving Binoche and Carrell comes off thanks to the writing and acting. Probably if you go on the wrong day you could find it a tad cloying overall but again the core is sound and there are just enough one-lines sprinkled throughout to take the edge off the hokey family. Juliette Binoche does this kind of thing sparingly having got her feet wet in Danielle Thompson's Dacalage Horaire opposite Jean Reno and it's great to see her letting her hair down. Not a world-beater but a pleasant diversion.",Dan in Real Life
10,george.schmidt,Carell makes the transition to leading rom/com with skillful flair; a surprising affair for all,8,15 November 2007,"DAN IN REAL LIFE (2007) *** Steve Carell, Juliette Binoche, Dane Cook, Alison Pill, Brittany Robertson, Marlene Lawston, Dianne Wiest, John Mahoney, Nobert Leo Butz, Amy Ryan, Jessica Hecht, Frank Wood, Emily Blunt. Surprisingly funny and heart-warming family oriented rom/com with Carell making the transition from second banana to leading man type that only few comic actors have treaded with any success (i.e. Robin Williams, Jim Carrey, Bill Murray), with skillful flair as a recently widowed self-help news columnist who meets cute Binoche at his sprawling family's yearly get-together, with the only problem getting in the way: she has just started seeing Cook, his kid brother. Director Peter Hedges  who co- wrote the smart screenplay with Pierce Gardner  wisely lets his star  and supporting actors  take center stage in what could've been a sticky, sickly affair of the heart.",Dan in Real Life
11,neil-476,Successful (and sweet) romantic comedy,8,15 May 2012,"Dan is a newspaper agony uncle. He has had a difficult time dealing with his wife's death, but has done the best he can because of his three daughters (the oldest is 17). On a trip to visit with his extended family, Dan meets Marie in a bookshop, and seriously connects with her: for the first time, he feels hope that he might love again. It turns out that Marie is also at the family get together, as the girlfriend of Dan's younger brother Matt.This romantic comedy is actually pretty funny, and all without resorting to the crassness which is all too prevalent in modern comedies. Steve Carell gives a touching and rounded performance, Juliet Binoche is both attractive and mousily ordinary as Marie, and all the supporting cast do exactly what they are meant to - support.I enjoyed this film a great deal.",Dan in Real Life
12,evanston_dad,Steve Carell's Moping Can Be Hard to Take,6,19 November 2007,"A harmless romantic comedy that begins to fall apart the second you start actually thinking about what you've just seen.Steve Carell plays the single dad (the mom died of some unnamed illness) of three girls who intensely dislike him, who takes his daughters to a family reunion at his parents' idyllic cabin in Rhode Island. There he finds out that his brother's new girlfriend (the radiant Juliette Binoche) is the same mystery woman he previously met and instantly fell in love with at a bookstore when he ran out on an errand. The rest of the film involves him acting like a baby because he can't have her, his entire family being disgusted with his behavior, and him realizing that though he makes a living out of giving people advice about how to get their lives together (the title of the film refers to his newspaper column moniker), he can't do the same for himself. The whole movie suffers the fate of many a romantic comedy in the same vein -- it's amiable, but rather limp. Too much of it feels forced. The screenplay can't allow Juliette Binoche to be a real woman -- she has to be a romantic comedy love interest, otherwise known as the Most Wonderful Woman God Ever Created. Events that would realistically play out over several weeks are crammed into a two- or three-day timespan. This is especially apparent and awkward in a late scene involving some newspaper executives who come to interview Dan about taking his column into syndication (they would really choose to come and meet with him while he's at a family reunion?) Dan's annoyingly perfect family has to share a group amphetamine addiction; otherwise there is no way to account for the manic energy they have (when they're not playing football or engaging in group exercise classes, they're planning talent shows). But mostly, and unfortunately, I thought the biggest flaw with the film was Carell himself. He moped to perfection in ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" but he's just aggravating here. I think we're meant to feel charmed and a bit heartbroken at seeing this man act like a petulant teenager, but I just wanted to tell him to get it together.The supporting cast is led by Dianne Wiest and John Mahoney as Dan's mom and dad, along with Dane Cook as his brother and Emily Blunt in a brief but memorable and sexy performance as a possible romantic alternative. However, everyone's talent is largely wasted.This is one of those unoffensive, unchallenging and uninteresting movies that's designed to give family crowds something to do when they tire of their Christmas shopping.Grade: B",Dan in Real Life
13,ferguson-6,Carrying the Torch,7,27 October 2007,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Peter Hedges' best work is ""Pieces of April"", a very edgy family drama/comedy that I have recommended to many. Although ""Dan in Real Life"" doesn't possess anywhere near the edginess of that film, it is an entertaining film with some clever moments ... though it is much more mainstream (by design).Steve Carell stars as Dan, a widower father of three daughters. Just in case you have forgotten, the movie does remind you just how wicked teenage girls can be ... even the good ones. The film centers around the annual family reunion at the parents' (Dianne Weist, John Mahoney) beautiful summer house in Rhode Island. Although the film borrows material from many large family comdrams, there are a handful of moments and lines that prevent it from being a total remix. Odd casting does help.Dane Cook and Emily Blunt have supporting roles that are both very well done. Personally I find it difficult to ever really like Dane Cook, but he controls his freak pretty well here. Ms. Blunt is a budding star (see ""The Devil Wears Prada"") and sooner or later, Hollywood will find the right roles to showcase her talents. By far the most outside the box casting occurs with Juliette Binoche in the pivotal role of Marie. Not to give too much away, but she does give new meaning to brotherly love.Carell is fine and at least isn't falling into the one-trick pony career of Ben Stiller. He does have some range as an actor and hopefully will mix in a few dramas with the slapstick. Wouldn't call this anything close to a classic, but it is a movie families (not the youngsters) can watch together and be entertained ... nothing wrong with that.",Dan in Real Life
14,anaconda-40658,Carell in Real Life.,6,25 December 2015,"Dan in Real Life (2007): Dir: Peter Hedges / Cast: Steve Carell, Juliette Binoche, Dane Cook, Emily Blunt, Alison Pill: Comedy about dealings with obstacles. Dan is a widowed father who is invited to his parents for the weekend. A chance encounter with a woman in a bookstore ends up being his brother's girlfriend. Directed by Peter Hedges with predictable circumstances where feelings aren't voiced. Steve Carell plays off the desperation and loneliness of Dan. He doesn't anticipate this weekend outing but this new romance sparks life into his otherwise routine existence. Juliette Binoche struggles with her feelings especially when learning that this charming new stranger is her boyfriend's brother. This cannot end well but viewers will likely understand since Dane Cook as the brother is a complete moron. He is all about everything that families aren't. Do families really play hide and seek, and do stupid group exercises in the yard, or sing foolish love songs? No wonder Binoche chose Carell. Then there is an appearance by Emily Blunt who is hooked up with Carell but ends up in another place by conclusion. Frankly, she seems like the bargain. The cast is a half and half in terms of who has a believable role and who plays a total jackass. Theme regards companionship but in reality most families are more like Dan than the spawn he came from. Score: 6 ½ / 10",Dan in Real Life
15,zetes,"Trite and clichéd, featuring the most annoyingly perfect family since the Osmands",5,23 March 2008,"This started out kind of charming. Not great, because from the first moment everything seems pretty clichéd, but charming nonetheless. But as it moved on, the clichés and contrivances started to become overwhelming. The story involves a widower (Steve Carell) with three daughters who, while visiting his parents in Rhode Island, meets a woman (Juliette Binoche) in a book store. They hang out for a few hours, talk, get to know each other. But she's in a relationship. Turns out, predictably, that it's his brother's girlfriend, and she's with him at their parents' house during some family reunion or something. Every subsequent scene involves the two would-be lovers being pushed together, whether they are playing hide-and-seek, doing aerobics, or taking a shower. It's never funny, and it becomes lamer each time. But if it were only this, the film would still be acceptable. Steve Carell is, of course, fantastic at playing chagrin, and he's so effortlessly lovable. Juliette Binoche has certainly started to show her age, but she's good and still attractive. It's really the whole family thing that drove me crazy. This is seriously the most loving family in human history. They hang together, have fun, and constantly play games with each other, whether it's competitive crosswords, charades, bowling, or, God help me, a family talent show. What kind of family has a family talent show? Jesus Christ! Sorry, maybe I'm just lamenting my own semi-dysfunctional family, but I'd say we were not that far below the curve. To spend time with this family would be about as oppressive as having ex-cons and sexual abusers in the family. It made me want to re-watch Baumbach's Margot at the Wedding just to get a breath of fresh air! Honestly, the movie's not that bad, but my purely subjective reaction was that it was insufferable!",Dan in Real Life
16,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Dan in Real Life,8,29 December 2007,"Comedian Steve Carell burst into mainstream prominence as the world's best know 40 Year Old Virgin, and popularity grew with his The Office US series. But a quick blip on the radar with Evan Almighty made us wonder if he will be able to sustain a series of successes given what I think is a dearth of funny comedians to hit the big screen of late - output seemed to have slowed a bit from the likes of Mike Myers, Ben Stiller (The Heartbreak Kid was not exactly really funny), Will Farell and even Jim Carrey, with whom Carell will be collaborating with in an animated feature in next year's Dr Horton Hears a Who.I thought Dan in Real Life followed the Adam Sandler route with having to star in this year's equivalent of the latter's Spanglish, and does show that Carell the funnyman has some dramatic acting chops in him to commandeer this movie on his shoulders. Like Sandler, he has this everyday man appeal without the need for any hint of exaggeration, and this chummy buddy persona that makes him quite likable.Steve Carell plays Dan the columnist who dispenses parenting advice in his newspaper column Dan in Real Life, where a routine day of the widower involves providing email counselling to his readers, and being the overprotective father to his three young daughters Jane, Cara and Lilly. Clearly while his love for them shows, his daddy nature goes overboard with not being convinced that one of them is old enough to drive under supervision, and another whose boyfriend and teenage puppy love infatuation stage he frowns upon. From the onset, his relationship with his daughters look set to improve given time out for an extended family get together in an out of town retreat, but as all romantic comedy dictates, he will meet a special somebody which will prove to be his undoing.Well, not in a bad way of course. Sometimes when you think about it, the concept of the perfect soulmate does reside in timing. You might think that you've met that special someone, but the timing somehow just isn't right, and naturally things do not work out, even though you think that it might (who plans for a breakup from the start anyway?) Watching how smooth Dan is, his mark Ann Marie (Juliette Binoche, whom we last saw on screen opposite Jude Law in Breaking and Entering) spends an afternoon with Dan chatting (with the camera lingering at all angles imagined possible), and find that they click. Just like that. However, herein lies the complication, as it turns out, Marie is the girlfriend of Dan's brother Mitch (Good Luck Chuck himself), whom he brought along to introduce to all and sundry.So now the question is, do you pretend that that spark of chemistry never existed, or like Mitch himself put it, so long as there's no rock on the finger, it's fair game? Here's where the fun in the movie comes in, with both parties trying to decide whether to tell, or play pretend amongst family members? And does each party think whether it's love, or just a passing stage of infatuation? The movie poses a number of questions, some of which the answers are fairly clear, depending on the values you subscribe to. But in pondering and reacting in a relatively childish manner, Dan does himself no favours, as he slowly slips into a mode of hypocrisy, becoming what he tells his daughters not to, and breaking almost all the rules he lays down for them.Dan in Real Life serves up more dramatic moments with a focus on romance, rather than being an outright comedy. So for Carell fans who think that it's gonna be laugh a minute, think again. The ensemble cast playing the supporting roles of the extended family members are fun, but truth is there's so many of them that each get very little screen time. However, this is still a very charming movie about love, parental-child unconditional love, and an exhibition of the axiom that blood is indeed thicker than water. Farell and Binoche share top notch chemistry as a couple with secrets hidden between themselves, and their constant playing of games is a delight to watch. One of my favourite scenes involve a 4-way interaction at a diner that hit all the right notes, and another an insane and totally politically incorrect song involving pigs.It's ultimately a feel good movie, so don't expect proceedings to go in too heavy and deep, as it skirts around the subplots it creates decently, with little surprises, playing out just like one will almost expect it to be. Given it's runtime, there are obvious scenes from the trailer that is left unused, which would probably appear in the DVD release. For Carell fans, and fans of family dramas with a dash of romance, this one comes recommended.And here's THE song in the movie, as performed by Carell and Dane Cook. Will surely open the floodgates for sentimental folks when you hear their rendition!",Dan in Real Life

18,Smells_Like_Cheese,"I expected better, but it's still a good film",7,15 March 2008,"I was so excited to rent Dan in Real Life, from the original movie trailer, this looked like it was going to be a great film, unfortunately, I never got to seeing it in the theater. But as soon as it was out on rental, I grabbed it without hesitation, I love Steve Carell so much, he's a great actor and has terrific comedic elements. So I watched this film last night and I have to say while it's still a good movie and has some really fun moments, I was expecting a little more. I think the story was a little predictable and the characters in the film, well, 99% of them were not likable at all. Dan was the only character who seemed likable and very normal, his daughters(excluding his youngest) were very immature and obnoxious. His brother, Mitch was extremely fake and also very annoying. The story is original but becomes a little predictable and turns into something that could've been more unique.Dan is a widower with his three daughters, life seems very depressing for him, his oldest can't wait to drive, his middle girl is in a lustful relationship, and his youngest is just begging for attention. He is also very lonely; on a weekend vacation with his family, he meets a lady, Marie, they talk on and on, but she says she has a boyfriend. Later on back at his parent's house, he sees Marie again, guess what? Her boyfriend is his brother, Mitch, can you smell the tension? Now they have to get through the weekend together trying to forget the chemistry they had.Dan in Real Life is definitely worth the look, no doubt about it. Steve pulls in a very good performance, Dane Cook, surprisingly does as well. It's a nice feel good movie of the year that will have you smiling in some scenes for sure. I just love how Dan keeps bumping into the cop for his driving scenes, ""just put it on my tab"", the way he said that was just so funny. Unfortunately the story could've been more, that's the only thing that was disappointing I'd have to say. It's good, but it could've been better, but I still recommend this movie, it is a good one, just I'm glad I rented before I bought.7/10",Dan in Real Life
19,KineticSeoul,Real life and yet sweet and amusing romantic comedy,7,18 February 2011,"I really didn't know what to expect from this film, but judging by the movie poster I thought it would be a movie about a guy who goes through depression. This is Dan Burns(Steve Carell) more serious roles where he doesn't act all quirky, jumpy or semi-retarded. Never the less Steve Carell is the main reason I decided to see this film, cause I enjoy watching his presence on screen. People go to watch movies to leave reality for a while, but this movie is believable when it comes to the real life of a man. Even the main actress in this movie is very homely looking. But it's a sweet movie that is done right. It isn't one of those movie that many people would go and watch in order to be entertained, but what it's a delightful film. The premise is basically about Dan who is a good father and raises 3 daughters after his wife passed away. Later bonds with a woman at a book store who is also good at making pancakes, a place I love spending time at. Anyways later the brother and a long time friend that is a girl gets involved. I can see how some audiences might get bored from the start of this movie, but I found it amusing not super exciting but amusing. And the movie start to really pick up steam when Emily Blunt is put into the equation. And wished she was used more to create a conflict or something along the line of being a obstacle. It's a bright and sweet and delightful romantic comedy that also involves a loving family. It isn't a movie I would watch again and again, but first time through it, I really enjoyed it.7.3/10",Dan in Real Life
20,sddavis63,Steve Carell's Best Performance To Date,8,3 January 2009,"Having never been especially impressed by Steve Carell as a lead actor, I approached ""Dan In Real Life"" somewhat cautiously, and found myself very taken by it. Carell put on a wonderful performance as Dan Burns, a newspaper advice columnist, who, in spite of the fact that he provides advice to parents and their kids, finds his own family life falling apart. Widowed for four years, he has become overprotective to his three daughters (who nevertheless struck me - especially the eldest - as unnecessarily snotty) and has almost ruined his relationship with them as a result. Unable to move on in life he has to attend an annual family reunion, and encounters Marie (Juliette Binoche) by chance in a local bookstore. They are immediately attracted to each other and spend the day together. Then, in an ironic twist of fate, Dan discovers that Marie is actually his brother's new love interest, and will be spending the weekend with the family. The two have to fight their feelings for each other and hide them from the rest of the family.What I really liked about this movie was the sadness of the character Carell played. He was immediately a character you could feel empathy for; one whose life is a tragedy plastered across the screen. The only role I can think of that came close to this one might have been his turn in ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" but I just didn't care for that movie for a variety of reasons. Here, pretty much everything worked together, with Carell's performance the highlight. Binoche was also very believable as she struggles to keep everything together in this insane situation she's found herself in. Some would call this a ""dramedy."" I suppose it qualifies for that moniker, although I found more drama here than comedy (although some scenes are rather funny) - and I appreciated the dramatic emphasis. I had mixed feelings about the apparently requisite happy ending. It was nice to see Dan move on and re-enter ""real life"" with the woman he loves, although there was something about his lostness that really connected and, in a sort of bizarre way, it was almost a shame to see that disappear. That's a relatively minor point, though, and the happy ending was probably inevitable anyway. This is a very good movie however you look at it. 8/10",Dan in Real Life
21,Robert_duder,"Really, very cute. A nice little romance, family comedy with some real laughs",8,15 November 2007,"If nothing else Steve Carell has turned me around on him as a comedian and as an actor. He has shown me that he has a wide range in films like the deplorable Anchorman (see my review) and then he can turn it around with such power house performances like 40 Year Old Virgin, and Little Miss Sunshine (see my reviews on both.) Dan In Real Life is not the 'powerhouse' film you might expect Carell to be in but instead it's a really nice movie and there is nothing wrong with that at all!! Best of all it's a comedy about a family, you're spending an entire weekend with this zany, normal, problem filled, angst ridden family of brothers and sisters and kids and Grandpa and Grandma and together they are all absolutely terrific!! One of the best ensemble casts of the year I think. And then you also have this underlying romance blossoming between the sweet yet slightly predictable widower who had the perfect wife and loved her deeply, and the second perfect woman to walk into his life. Now if you can let go of the fact that he falls madly and head over heels in love with this woman in three days...a little rushed...it's a very cute love story about a Dad with three precocious daughters.Steve Carell is Dan. He's the widowed father of three daughters that he longs to protect and love but two of them are at that defiant stage of Teenager. Carell as Dan is a terrific doting father and despite the fact that his attempts might seem a little predictable it's still adorable and downright funny time and time again. It would have made a terrific sitcom. Plus Carell is so down to earth and has this terrific chemistry with everyone and is an amazing physical comedian. Juliette Binoche is the object of his new affections. Her and Carell have terrific chemistry although for some reason I'm just not fond of her all that much. She does a decent job and their chemistry is good and she has some funny moments but sometimes it feels forced on her part like she is more of a serious actress and she doesn't quit fit the mold that the film has. The rest of the cast is the family and they are just downright terrific. All of them are so significant and they all support Carell perfectly and they just make for hilarity including Dane Cook (another comedian that I have come to respect a little more and he is terrific as the womanizing, athletic brother), Alison Pill, Dianne Wiest (terrific as the ever wise Grandma of the family), John Mahoney, Jessica Hecht and the others I just don't have room for. Plus the three girls that play Dan's daughters are absolutely priceless!! Alison Pill, Brittany Robertson, and Marlene Lawston are absolutely terrific and memorable in their roles.Some will definitely call Dan In Real Life a little predictable and stereotypical and that might be true to an extent but it doesn't take away from the fact that the cast works so well together and the humor really shines from slapstick, roll in the aisles, to chuckles throughout. One liners, funny real life moments, and physical comedy to boot. Steve Carell commands the film and everyone else falls into line and they work together to make you smile, laugh and maybe some tears too. It's romance, family comedy, maybe a little brash and crude humor but nothing to make you wince. It's worth seeing and something everyone can find something to love. Dan In Real Life got panned for being plain but I think it's just fine the way it is!! 8.5/10",Dan in Real Life

Second is Dan, a widower for years, falls in love in just a couple of days and is willing to go behind his brother's back.Dan and his 3 daughters go to his family's get together for a long weekend. Dan goes out and runs into a woman, Marie, whom he talks to for a long time and seems to have a connection. Problem is he later finds out Marie is his brother's new girlfriend and now he must stay in the same house with her and forget his romantic feelings. He tries to act annoying and even goes out on a blind date, but Marie and his brother come along. One scene that made little sense is when Marie and Dan are in the bathroom and he hides in the shower when his daughter comes in. Marie instead of telling the girl to wait outside and she will talk to her later, lets the girl stays and she ends up getting into the shower with Dan. I guess that was supposed to be funny, but it was just dumb. Can Dan and Marie keep their feelings hidden or does it all come out in the open? Watch to find out.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, but it just didn't seem like Dan and Marie had a real connection since only knowing each other 2 days. The romance was lacking.",Dan in Real Life
23,g-bodyl,Sweet and Relatable!,9,8 March 2013,"Some people may find Peter Hedge's Dan in Real Life to be gross and overly sentimental. But I found this movie to be really sweet with one exception and a film that has a big heart beating in the middle of it. Now, I am not a big fan of rom coms but I was glad to see this because I was able to relate to Steve Carell's character not from his point of view, but from the daughters' points of view. That leads me to explain that one exception about the sweetness. The daughters were way too mean to their father. They should have had some more respect to the guy who raised them alone for four years.This film is about a single father who is a columnist that gives readers advice on teens. When he and his daughter take a trip to visit his family, he falls in love with a woman at a bookstore. Little does he know this woman happens to be the girlfriend of his very own brother.Steve Carell was very sweet and likable in the movie. I felt very sympathetic towards his character. He wasn't funny in this movie as he normally is but he shows that he can act without all his jokes. Juliette Binoche is lovely as the bookstore woman. Carell's daughters could have been better if a little nicer.Overall, this is a sweet little comedy or I should say film. It's not really a comedy per se, but a movie that has comedy moments. I am not big on these big romantic comedies, but this film has made me respect the genre a little more. I rate this film 9/10.",Dan in Real Life

25,inkblot11,"Really, quite nice, but nothing great....the cast definitely supersedes the material",6,13 January 2008,"Dan Burns (Steve Carell) is a widower and newspaper columnist with three daughters. Eldest daughter Jane is nearly eighteen but is not allowed to drive the car on long trips with the family. Kara, a lovely 15 year old, is smitten with a cute boy but her father discourages the young lovers at every turn. Youngest daughter Lily just wants some time alone with dad. On a family trip to Rhode Island, where nearly every relative will be visiting as well, Dan learns soon enough that his brother Mitch (Dane Cook) has a new girlfriend with him and that he, Dan, will have to sleep in the laundry room. In need of some fresh air, Dan goes to the quaint village nearby and enters the book shop. There, looking for some reading material, is a lovely lady who says her name is Marie (Juliette Binoche). Posing as a store clerk, Dan makes some suggestions and Marie thanks him for his time. In truth, Dan feels something he has not experienced for nearly four years, an attraction to a woman, and he insists that Marie give him her phone number. Back at the homefront, Dan is eager to tell everyone about his encounter with a good looking female when she suddenly comes down the stairs. That's right, folks, SHE is Mitch's new girlfriend. Through family game nights, touch football matches, and more, Dan has plenty of time to pine for Marie. But, is she only interested in his brother? This is a nice movie with a very good cast. Carell is funny and realistic as both the stern father and the lovelorn widower. Binoche is beautiful and charming, as always, and Cook is also fine as the handsome but careless brother. Other wonderful thespians include John Mahoney, Dianne Wiest, and Emily Blunt. The costumes are quite fetching and the east coast scenery most lovely, too. However, the movie never ascends to the ""great"" category, only good, mostly due to a script which is uneven and unsure of itself, at times. The direction, too, lacks some sparkle. That said, most fans of romantic comedy will consider this film a nice diversion for any given evening, with a pot of tea in close proximity.",Dan in Real Life
26,Floated2,Weak plot and annoying characters ruin a good opportunity,2,14 September 2010,"I feel like this film could have been much better had the writers let the actors do more. It was a waste of Steve Carell's talent in this film. He wasn't able to do his normal funny routine. His character was kinda bizarre and boring throughout the entire film. He was more depressed with his life (him being a widower and raising 3 teen girls). The characters in the film are basically Steve Carell's (Dan) family & the female he meets in a bookstore- Juliette Binoche (Marie). The problem in view with the film is that its not a comedy or romantic comedy, its more describe as a dramedy. Also its extremely boring and has a very thin plot. It just takes place at Dan's parents house with his family members and Marie. The introduction to Dan and Marie is quite odd. They meet at a local bookstore while Marie is trying to find novels to read and Dan is there and gives her suggestions. They end up talking and having a conversation until she leaves. Afterwards Dan returns home and tell his family that he met a woman. However, Marie ends up being his brother's-- Dan Cook (Mitch) girlfriend. Throughout the film we see Dan depressed over Marie and him showing emotion towards her but no one knowing that she was the one--until the final few scenes.The thing about this film is that it felt real boring and the plot just wasn't that much. In a way it did sort of feel like real life (spending time with a big family, playing family traditional games, the atmosphere, the teenagers attitudes, the boring conversation). But many things just felt unrealistic especially the fact that Marie ends up being Mitch's girlfriend; because Dan met her at the bookstore. Like what are the chances that the person you meet and like ends up being your brothers girl. Maybe this has happened to some people but to me it felt ridiculously fake. Also a scene where Dan goes to meet Marie at a bowling alley, and he ends up kissing her, then a few seconds his whole family is there to come in and they basically walk on in on them. This was after Marie and Mitch broke up (it was noted to be 2 hrs later). I don't see how that would have actually happened. One thing that was annoying were the characters. I really didn't feel for any of the characters except Dan's (it was in his point of view so that is expected). I disliked his girls (they were rude and disrespectful to their father throughout) and parents, also his brother and most of the family. Marie seemed nice but was also boring. The film ends with Dan apologizing telling his kids he messed up. Their actions never get addressed and they never got disciplined. Overall the whole film made Steve Carell look in pain. The film's final scene is shown to be Dan and Marie getting married with his family around him at the same house outside. It didn't state a timeline, I thought it was pretty awkward and weird but not really predictable. The writers wee tying to make everything a happy ending. Also, while watching the film, it felt more like a television who(reality-TV show maybe or a documentary)",Dan in Real Life
27,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"It looks and feels like ""real life,"" but ""Dan"" is far from it",6,27 May 2008,"Rarely does a film feel as human and believable as ""Dan in Real Life"" does, but for all the ways that you can relate to this film and its characters, it goes from something ""real"" to something that is in fact preposterous and all too convenient where thematic epiphany is concerned.To start, ""Dan in Real Life"" starts out as a film about a widower (Carell) who is having issues raising his three daughters. When the Burns family meets up with the other Burns for their annual family reunion in Rhode Island, the plot takes a surprisingly farcical twist when Dan meets a woman (Binoche) at a bookstore and comes back to tell his family only to find she's dating his brother Mitch (Cook). Touching family drama and farce don't exactly mix and that's where this film becomes disjointed and ultimately not poignant. The farce premise has you wanting to laugh out loud, but the humor is light and amusing at best, as is the warm and likable disposition of Carell. Carell is best known for his comedy work, but when he is the sole comedic force of whatever he is in, his film does poorly. He's always been good when his supporting cast is talented. Think ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" or even ""The Office"" versus ""Evan Almighty."" Carell provides a few extra laughs at best and knowing his work it's not anything fresh.Writer and director Peter Hedges, known for his dysfunctional family dramedies, deserves applause for his ability to create believable relationships/characters and for the most part dodge melodrama in dialogue. Though sometimes a bit much, he has a good gage on what a family is like or at least how they interact. However, as the film reaches climax, it seems he tries a bit too hard to create an epiphany and for all the situations and problems between characters to work themselves out in some clever way. To top that off with the obvious irony of Dan being an advice columnist for families is a bit much.""Dan in Real Life"" is incredibly well-intentioned, but the combination of family and farce formulas is not exactly a perfect marriage. The film needed to go in one of those two directions and eliminating the attempts at farce would probably have been the right route. It's fine in premise, but it takes it along for too much of the film. Otherwise, there are a lot of things to like about ""Dan"" and certainly nothing to hate. It's the cheese-factor that holds this movie back.",Dan in Real Life
28,Anonymous_Maxine,Steve Carell's most disastrous failure so far?,4,21 April 2009,"There was something that told me that Dan in Real Life was going to be a great comedy, one of those overlooked gems that come along and don't get the recognition that they deserve until years later (like The Big Lebowski). MAN was I wrong. This is a sappy, awkward, uncomfortable drama that thinks it's a comedy but ultimately never figures out which direction to go. It presumes to give us a realistic story of a single father raising three daughters some years after the death of his wife and their mother, but then gives us a cheesy, half-wit sitcom that's about as realistic as The Great Outdoors and not 1/10 as funny. Dan is a single father raising three daughtersoh wait, I already said that. We learn about the relationship between Dan and his daughters as they're gearing up for the road trip out to their annual family reunion. The youngest daughter is wise beyond her years, the middle daughter is growing exasperated to learn what kind of man her father really is, and the oldest teenage daughter is in love with some punk kid. Dan finding thongs in her laundry doesn't make him feel any better.In fact, the only thing that is remotely realistic about the movie is the relationship between the girls and their father. The tension in the house is through the roof and is never overdone or unrealistic, but it's also never funny even for a second. OK, so here's what happens, you'll love this. Soon after arriving to meet the family, Dan is in a bookstore and has a highly scripted run-in with Marie (Juliette Binoche), a beautiful brunette with whom Dan feels an immediate connection. They have a quick coffee together before she gets a phone call and has to leave, revealing to Dan that she is already in a relationship. Dan goes back to his house and starts talking about this amazing woman he just met, and then his brother Mitch proudly introduces his girlfriend, Marie, to the family. So most of the comedy results from Dan and Marie trying to keep their secret from the family, but unfortunately all it leads to is a lot of awkward and uncomfortable situations that even the eternally awkward Ben Stiller might hesitate to be a part of. Dan is summarily ignored by everyone in the family while they dote on Marie, urging her and Mitch to get married and acting as if Dan's not even there. At another point Dan loses his temper and creates a huge scene during dinner. Marie and Mitch get all cuddly and touchy feely in front of him and I guess we're supposed to laugh good-naturedly as he watches helplessly. Oh but wait, that's not even the good part! There is a scene in this movie where Dan's brother-in-law, while in the same room with Dan's mother and father, urges Dan to masturbate so he doesn't get too ""backed up."" He reminds Dan, in front of his MOTHER, that it's important to ""unplug the drain."" God, it was awful.I'm gonna go ahead and put something out there. First of all, this is not an original scene. It was as old as the hills when it came up in American Pie ten years ago, but I'm going to go ahead and suggest that such a thing has never ever ever ever happened in real life. Such things only happen in bad comedies like Dan in, ahem, Real Life. Every cliché is represented here. The tactless brother-in-law, the obligatory scene showing that people in movies don't understand that dance-offs are simply not funny, the sketchy blind date with the chick who turns out to be crazy hot, even (my favorite) the ""oops I'm so sorry I just fell down and well shucks here I am laying right on top of you"" routine. What ever happened to real life? The title of this movie is an even bigger lie than Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter! Eight chapters later, I'd just like to finally put this on the record - Final chapter my ass!!Or consider this. There's a scene in the movie where Dan finds himself standing in the shower fully clothed with Marie while she showers with Dan's daughter just outside the shower curtain talking to Marie about her love and sex worries. So if you imagine such a thing could ever be amusing, then by all means I won't dissuade you from watching this movie. But I will tell you this - I can imagine that there was a time when this movie looked good on paper, but something went wrong along the way and the result is a static, depressing drama without a scrap of personality. And one of the biggest problems is that Juliette Binoche, a tremendously talented actress, doesn't have a shred of chemistry with anyone on screen and looks completely out of place anywhere in the movie. She comes across as a classy European traveler, and the movie never aspires to explain how such a woman could end up with a tool like Dane Cook.The movie wants to be a charming family romantic comedy about love gone wrong and then right, or something like that, but unfortunately it comes across as a thoroughly depressing snooze-fest that is neither realistic nor amusingly fictional. The story ultimately contorts back on itself and forces a cookie-cutter Hollywood ending and even a cloying inspirational voice-over speech that rivals the one at the end of Bride Wars for pure, happy crappiness. Let's just be honest, shall we? The thing is a train wreck. Enjoy at your own risk!",Dan in Real Life

I'll have to say that this is probably my favorite of his films so far, in that he isn't a brain-dead mouth-breather, and actually demonstrates some degree of intelligence. Honestly, I like it...and I like Steve Carell IN it. I think he may have found a new niche. At least I hope he has. This is heartwarming, with great characters, interesting quirks, and some lovely dialog. I loved watching the relationship between Carell's character and his daughters. While endearing, they were also totally believable, delivering honest portrayals and a lovely sense of actually watching a family instead of just a bunch of kids thrown together and labeled as Carell's kids.This was beautiful.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Dan in Real Life
30,Turfseer,"Slow-paced, predictable 'tearjerker'",4,12 November 2007,"There's little to get excited about ""Dan in Real Life"". First off, the whole setup is incredibly contrived. Did you really believe that during that very long first meeting conversation at the restaurant, Marie wouldn't have told Dan where she was going? And since Dan did all the talking during that conversation, why would she be so attracted to him? For that matter, I never figured out why Marie was so attracted to Dan throughout the movie. He's very narcissistic and does little to convince us that he's truly a good guy (for example he lies to Marie in the bookstore, ridicules his brother about his past girlfriends and tries to make Marie jealous with a 'blind date'). There's more contrivance such as that ridiculous scene at the bowling alley where Dan and Marie are caught making out by the whole family. Yeah like that could really happen.

31,Chris Knipp,What's real about it?,6,11 December 2007,"Peter Hedges, who penned the screenplays for the admired indie films What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Pieces of April (and he directed the latter) as well as the successful adaptations of Nick Hornby's About a Boy and Jane Hamilton's A Map of the World, has now guided comic Steve Carell of Judd Apatow's The 40-Year-Old Virgin in a romantic comedy about two brothers vying for the same woman at a large family gathering--which will remind you of the one in The Family Stone, or Home for the Holidays, or for that matter Pieces of April, and a wide variety of American ensemble film comedies--all of which are better focused and more successful than this lame, often cringe-worthy attempt to merge Meet Cute with soppily sentimental treatments of death and sibling rivalry. What was Hedges thinking? He and everybody concerned are obviously capable of much better than this.One thing that's overwhelmingly clear is that the main plot points got lost in the overstuffed ensemble shuffle. Even when Carell's character, Dan, a widower and ""real world"" newspaper commentator with three girls he can't connect with, is in a basement bedroom it fills up with a jumble of family members. Once Carell and a misused Juliette Binnoche have had their tiresome first encounter at a bookstore--whereupon he woos her by talking nonstop for an hour or so--dialogue that happily we're mostly spared--every scene is replete with aerobics, charades, amateur night, dancing, or extras running back and forth, including a bevy of poor child actors who rarely get to utter a line. And this is not to mention some positively sick-making song sessions. Ultimately this is a movie that avoids saying anything at all about love and about how people fall in and out of it. There's even an implied subtext that says love's better avoided or repressed. But it's hard to read any message here, since the primary sound is of static. And if motivations and emotions aren't developed, characters can't be, either.The writing fudges every key point. What gets Carell so interested in Binoche in the bookstore? We never learn anything about her, nor does he. Suddenly he's all over her, gathering a pile of tones including Anna Karenina and a life of Gandhi, taking advantage of her mistaking him for the salesman. Hasn't that been done before? Yes, and better. Later, when Binoche leaves Carell's brother (Dane Cook), there's no scene showing why. Of course he's an offensive boor, but if she hasn't seen that so far, what makes her see it now? No dialogue, not even a frown, to tell us. The result is a movie whose main developments are predictable, yet inexplicable. Nor has Hedges the ability as a director to maintain a consistent tone (he veers too often in and out of maudlin and slapstick) or to thread the romantic comedy clearly through all the jumble of background. The noise overwhelms the dialogue, and some plot lines and characters got emasculated in the cutting room, or on the computer. Carell's mom, Dienne Wiest (also wasted) is inexplicably sadistic toward him. An ironic, pessimist relative, a potentially funny character, has only two lines, not enough to define him. The lovelorn daughter Brittany Robertson's boyfriend (Felipe Dieppa) is summarily packed off in a car, and that takes care of that little problem. When a writer-director's so short with his characters, how are we supposed to care about them? All Hedges has succeeded in doing is maintaining the noise level, and when it's all over, the memories, despite valiant efforts from the cast, are more embarrassing than funny.",Dan in Real Life
32,Polaris_DiB,"Realistic, heartfelt approach",7,25 October 2007,"Steve Carell gets something resembling the Ben Stiller treatment here: the story of a warm, gentle, and funny guy who nevertheless manages to fall into awkward situations involving circumstance, only to error and apologize his way out of it and into potential happiness. Carell adds his own flavor, however, trading in wackiness for a general quiet discomfort. Indeed, Carell makes a much better dry comedian than clown, as his work in movies like Little Miss Sunshine and 40 Year Old Virgin are so much more endearing and compelling than movies like Anchorman and Evan Almighty.The story is of Dan Burns, editorial writer, widower, and father of three young girls who takes them all to their family reunion in order to breathe some fresh life into himself. Ironically, he actually manages to do just that at first, when after his mother (an amazing, comfortable Dianne Wiest) forces him out of the house to give his daughters some space for a while, he meets the engaging and lovely Marie (Juliette Binoche, still lovely as ever). But we're not here to watch a man fall in love, remarry, and live happily ever after without some real drama, so of course Marie happens to be already taken--this time by none other than Dan's brother Mitch (Dane Cook) who, in typical Cook fashion means a little arrogant and not quite that great of a guy.It is actually in the character of Mitch that this movie has some real skill, however. Being that Cook is such a well established comedian and easily recognizable character, it would have been easy to just let him go the one-dimensional route and really be that much of a jerk in every way, but the script takes special care to show that Mitch truly does love his brother and his girlfriend and really wants to make this situation work. Dan, thus, has to both struggle with his disappointment and attraction with the fact that he also cares for his brother and wants to be supportive of his attempts to change. The result is some really nice, and particularly funny, tension. The important thing is that in typical RomCom fashion, we know the two leads are eventually going to get together and that it's just a matter of time for waiting for them to just do it, but this time we dread the moment because we don't really want Mitch to get hurt either, especially since it will undo all that he's been trying to make for himself during the movie.However, there's the usual tropes. I mean, how many movies of this type have you seen that feature the lead sneaking out of a window to avoid getting caught in a particularly embarrassing situation, only to fall off of the roof? I mean really. Secondly, Dan's middle daughter and lesson in the suddenness of love is nothing but annoying and ridiculous, and she alone drags down the movie more than Dane Cook ever could have, which is saying something. The movie makes up for it by filling the house with many warm and realistic family characters--the mass is important for a lot of the action, though it's iffy over whether some of the characters really need to be there, but it makes for a repeated claustrophobia/isolation dynamic that the directing stresses throughout the movie.And for a movie that could have easily just been a throwaway date movie, the directing and cinematography are done with extreme care for detail, movement, and economy. There's a lot of compositional and camera movement elements that bring the story much more strongly to the audience, and the jokes are as likely to be close-ups of Carell's or Binoche's expressive faces as they are multiple people giving Dan crap for his moodiness. This movie tried for a high amount of realism and thankfully succeeds.--PolarisDiB",Dan in Real Life
33,ackstasis,"""Instead of telling our young people to plan ahead, we should tell them to plan to be surprised""",7,15 June 2009,"Steve Carell is no longer the guy who points to random objects in the room and declares that he loves them; his screen persona has matured. He can still be sidesplittingly funny, and occasionally dim-witted, but somewhere along the line he's come to represent society's everyman – bright, honest, likable, but tinged with a wistful sadness (maybe Frank Sinatra had his sort in mind whenever he sang ""Here's to the Losers""). This transition probably began with Apatow's 'The 40 Year Old Virgin (2006),' in which Carell gave an affable, sensitive performance, but any warmth in that film was quickly drowned amid the crude, unfunny sexual humour, inexorably aimed at a teenage audience. 'Dan in Real Life (2007)' strikes a more welcoming balance of laughter and sincerity, characteristic of its director, Peter Hedges, who also wrote 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)' and 'About a Boy (2002).' Avoiding the typical ""quirkiness"" that has seemingly pervaded every recent indie comedy, the film is entertaining and surprisingly touching, with laughs and tears to spare.Dan Burns (Carell) is an agony columnist who would do well to read his own advice once in a while. While helping thousands address their personal issues daily, Dan, a widower, himself struggles to remain optimistic while raising three argumentative daughters. After various hot-headed disagreements, Dan takes the family to his parents' Rhode Island home, where the Burns tribe congregates intermittently for fun games, good food, and to meet brother Mitch's (Dane Cook) latest significant other. But this time, of course, things are different. While evading his sorrows in the local bookstore, Dan meets and charms a beautiful lady, Marie (Juliette Binoche), to whom he therapeutically spills his life and hopes. When Marie turns out to be Mitch's latest acquisition, arriving to meet the Burns family for the first time, neither she nor Dan know how to respond, and their relationship is tossed into a whirlwind of ambiguity, jealousy, frustration and plain bad luck. Will the conservative Dan let his only chance of happiness slip away, or will he risk betraying his family's trust?While the film's concept could easily have been exploited merely as a fun gimmick – like, say, 'Meet the Parents (2000)' – Peter Hedges ensures that his story has a heart, as well. Even when his comedy style extends into slapstick, such as his plummet from the second-storey window, Carell's performance always feels authentic and sincere; one really does feel the elation of his highs, and gutting emptiness of his lows. Juliette Binoche is also unceasingly charming, full of culture and youthful vitality despite edging into her mid-40s. The supporting performers, among them ""Frasier's"" John Mahoney, aren't given very much to do, but collectively they represent a strong, close-knit family dynamic. Alas, the film does stray off course every now and then. Brittany Robertson's role as Dan's love-struck teenage daughter was extraordinarily grating, more so than my own sister when she was at that age. More damningly, Hedges short-changes Dan's betrayal of brother Mitch, casting the consequences aside far too quickly, as though only to allow for a quick, clean and guilt-free final chapter.",Dan in Real Life
34,GiraffeDoor,You could do worse.,6,28 November 2019,"Saccharine and obnoxious, yet mostly watchable, account of a no-nonsense father finding he might be as clueless about life as his kids.It's one of those movies where the idealistic youth gives the older people a lesson in love and we're supposed to take it seriously.With very few characters that are greatly likeable, this keeps the interest simply for its technical skill in having an original tone and well developed, stylized dialogue.Carrell proves he is more versatile an actore than Jude Apatow wants us to think he is.",Dan in Real Life
35,mattkratz,brilliant!,9,5 March 2010,"This was a truly hilarious movie and true to real life. Steve Carrell was the perfect choice to play the title character who is in a contradiction of terms:he is an advice columnist, but he doesn't know how to handle it when his own family life is in chaos. He goes to a family reunion with his daughters (he is a widower) to help settle things, and the results are hilarious and heartwarming. I love the scenes at the beginning with the daughters, which show how he has trouble handling it when they want to get involved with boys, both as friends and as romance. The scenes with the family at the reunion are great, and Carrell's performance is nothing short of brilliant. I truly recommend this one.*** out of ****",Dan in Real Life
36,EUyeshima,Carell Matures in a Warm and Winning Ensemble Comedy About Coming to Terms,8,28 October 2007,"One of the genuine surprises of Judd Apatow's ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" was the sense of self-effacing melancholy Steve Carell brought to the title role. The concept could have gone south quickly, but he brought a certain unexpected gravitas that kept the movie from being strictly a one-joke situation. Director/co-screenwriter Peter Hedges (whose first and last film was the quirky ""Pieces of April"") captures this more fully in his gentle, character-driven 2007 comedy about a widowed father who takes his three daughters to the annual family reunion and finds the love of his life is taken by someone else close to him. From this sitcom-sounding premise comes a surprisingly alert and sweet-spirited movie thanks to a perceptive script by Hedges and Pierce Gardner (whose only previous writing credit is a horror flick, ""Lost Souls"") and especially Carell's heartfelt performance as the emotionally straitjacketed Dan, a more rounded portrayal than he was able to give as the suicidal gay brother in ""Little Miss Sunshine"". There are plenty of laughs but mostly quiet ones borne out of the characters and their very human situations.The primary irony in the story is how Dan plays a newspaper columnist who gives out parenting advice but cannot seem to follow it in raising his daughters. Each girl is challenged in different ways by Dan's omnipresence in their lives with middle daughter Cara most pained over his intrusion in her budding romance with a smitten classmate. Once they make it to his parents' picturesque Rhode Island home, he meets Marie in the local bookstore where their chemistry becomes palpable almost immediately. After he shares everything about himself to her for hours, Dan sees her rush off only to meet her again back home as her younger brother Mitch's new girlfriend. Everyone is crazy about her, but Dan is only crazed with unfulfilled jealousy and hesitant resignation over his plight. Having just seen her relentlessly downbeat work in Anthony Minghella's ""Breaking and Entering"", I am happy to see the beguiling touch Juliette Binoche effortlessly brings to such an idealized love interest as Marie. The usually insufferable Dane Cook is surprisingly agile as Mitch, though his casting is obviously a sign of the inevitable turn of events.Sporting a very convincing American accent, Emily Blunt (the viperous first assistant Emily in ""The Devil Wears Prada"") steals her few scenes as Dan's loose-limbed blind date Ruthie. On the sidelines are John Mahoney and Dianne Wiest as Dan's down-to-earth parents with Wiest particularly sharp in doling out pragmatic advice to her insulated son. It's good to see Broadway's Norbert Leo Butz on screen as Dan's married brother Clay. The three daughters are dexterously played by Alison Pill (who repeats her level-headed work from ""Pieces of April"") as the eldest Jane, Marlene Lawston (who played Jodie Foster's missing child in ""Flightplan"") as the youngest Lilly and especially Brittany Robertson who captures all the adolescent angst as thong-wearing Cara. The seaside charm of Rhode Island is captured well by Lawrence Sher's expert cinematography, and Norwegian folk rocker Sondre Lerche provides the lilting soundtrack. There is, however, one scene that uses Pete Townshend's pop classic, ""Let My Love Open the Door"", to poignant effect thanks to Carell's affecting rendition. Even with all its predictable touches, this movie caught me off-guard with its warmth and humanism.",Dan in Real Life

40,ctomvelu1,Carrell all the way,7,26 March 2013,"I was impressed to see the box office total on this very modest indie, which can be chalked up to the presence of Steve Carell in the lead. Carrell is on a roll at present and seems unable to do anything wrong (except perhaps for his Noah flick). He may not be Matt Damon or Ben Affleck, but he always draws a crowd. Smart of the filmmakers to capitalize on his presence; just look at the poster/cover art. DAN tells an old tale -- a very old one -- of love tied up in a triangle. Carrell plays a lonely widower with three growing daughters who meets a charming Frenchie (Binoche) in a bookstore and is instantly smitten. Unfortunately, he soon learns she's dating his kid brother (Cook). Complications ensue. Without Carrell, the film would be unwatchable. Cook is insufferable as always and Binoche fails to register in any meaningful way, even in the requisite shower scene. . Carrell's very white, upper middle class family is made up of 1950's stereotypes, and the setting (the beaches of Rhode Island) is one huge cliché. But Carrell is on in just about every scene, thank God. He manages to keep things moving along, right through the very clichéd finale.",Dan in Real Life

Widower and advice columnist Dan (Carell) takes his kids to visit his mother and father for the weekend, and runs into Maria (Binoche) and falls for her. Turns out Maria is his brother's date for that very weekend at mom and dad's. Ouch! Sounds like a lot of fun. Mom and pop's kids and their kids go see g-mom and g-pop once a year for games, and good family fun. One can just see the possibilities for a lot of things, some comedic moments, some good talk, some romance, some silly stuff. The problem is that it didn't work that way and there were no comedic moments, no romance between some adults that should have had some moments, and there were no good lines. Anyone could see, at a glance, that there were a lot of people trying too hard to have fun. All this despite the fact that Dan kept mooning over Maria. Nothing worked.I think the premise of this movie was to show that being an advice columnist giving out pearls of wisdom for others in relationships didn't work for Dan. The main problem was that he falls in love in a New York minute upon meeting Maria and we don't care. We are not caught up in it. So it doesn't surprise me that everything else after that falls flat.

45,dunmore_ego,Dan in Reel Life.,4,15 February 2009,"Dan (Steve Carell) falls for a chick who, unbeknownst to him, is his brother's girlfriend. Chick Flick heaven.DAN IN REAL LIFE opens with advice columnist Dan, single father of three girls, raising them like the movie dad he is, traveling to a family gathering. We know the movie's premise going in, so it's a waiting game for the Meet Cute. When it happens, men will run outside and vomit. It's that egregious.Dan meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and immediately piles on the Inane Chatter (the senseless drivel men dribble while biding our time for The Getting of Panty). Marie burns so much screen time, we figure she must be ""the brother's girlfriend."" Now we sit back and await the reveal for Dan.At exactly the 25-minute mark - like it says in all the Screen writing Guides - both Dan and Marie find they are attending the same family gathering, but Marie is dating Dan's brother, Mitch (Dane Cook). Oh, Wackiness, thou harsh mistress! We also know that Marie is a slut.Whoa! Isn't this just a dumb Chick Flick? Of course it is - that's why double standards and duplicity, dishonesty and denial are the order of the day, instead of real honesty, which is ironically what women THINK they want from men. Marie is a slut because - as the Chick Council of Romance decrees - when a woman is dating someone, she should ward off alien hormonal males (in this case, Dan) by snidely dropping the word ""boyfriend"" into intelligent conversation when she discerns the hormonal male's advance. Marie doesn't. She lets Dan ramble Inane Chatter for hours.Chick Flickers will say Marie neglected to block Dan because ""they were meant for each other."" Really? Then why is she with brother Mitch? How did the intelligent, well-read Marie ever fall for a dumbski like Mitch in the first place? Movie offers no explanation so we must assume it was that big swingin' thing between his legs. This brings us full circle as to Marie being... oh, now you get it. After hours of coffee and claptrap, just before she leaves the Meet Cute, Marie tells Dan she's ""seeing someone,"" and Dan - like any hormonal male - pushes his advantage, telling her their Inane Chatter seems unfinished, so why not exchange phone numbers because ""all we'd be is two people finishing a conversation."" After I ran outside and vomited, I pondered on whether Marie - or any chick over 13 - would fall for that line in 2007. Director-writer Peter Hedges and co-writer Pierce Gardner must think so. Guess you're never too old to be a 40-year-old virgin.The audacity to call their movie ""in Real Life""...Here's another gem (men, prepare to run outside again): ""Love is not a feeling. It's an ability."" Wipe the left side... you've got some stuff hanging... okay, onward - The message of DAN IN REAL LIFE is clear: Ladies, time-serve with anyone who mildly amuses you until someone better comes along. The irony is that in Real Life everyone does this - scarring souls and ripping flesh along the way - but no one will admit they are all looking to trade up (or trade across when boredom takes them), sugarcoating the reality of serial monogamy with ""love"" mysticism to justify the mating proclivities of humans.Too much for Chicks to digest? Of course it is, so movie is padded with the requisite asinine scenes: girls versus boys crossword puzzle (girls winning, of course, because we all know housefraus are more worldly than their breadwinning husbands); Dan hiding in the shower with his clothes on and the shower being turned on; the family talent show where no one displays any talent (Dan singing Townshend's Let My Love Open the Door earned him some man points); Dan turning down a lucrative job offer to moon over his True Love; the double standard double date - Marie has already spurned Dan, yet when Dan dirty-dances with another chick, Marie gets fire-engine-red jealous.DAN IN REAL LIFE serves its vapid purpose of deluding chicks into thinking this is real life. Listen up, 13 year olds: it is not. Take it from someone who has lived through this situation three times (with a cousin's girlfriend, a drummer's girlfriend and a roommate's girlfriend). I played the part of Dan - the ""other guy,"" without the dweeb trimmings - and still the movie does not resonate with me, because it's so sophomoric, so Chick-Flicky. I never once hid in a shower, turned down a job or let her beat me at a crossword puzzle. But there was lots of Inane Chatter.If there is electricity, bide your time, while you do unto others. And the electric girl will be yours one day, ready, willing, hopefully disease-free and unable to get pregnant, overlapping her ""monogamous"" relationship with you on the side, justifying it to the God of Chick Flick Heaven as both of you ""meant for each other."" And you'll go along with this snivel drivel because of the electric panty...In DAN IN REAL LIFE, Dan's whole family busts Dan and Marie ""in love"" and the sticky problem of the ousted brother must be resolved. He wasn't a bad person - he was just there for the plot. So Mitch starts dating the Convenient Chick from the double date. Exactly what would happen in real life. Yay! Dan and Marie marry and everything will be joyous and happy and gay from now on because that's what marriage is in real life.Now run outside.--Review by Poffy the Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",Dan in Real Life

Not that the movie is laugh out loud funny it's just that it has a big heart. We all like Steve Carell, this isn't what fans of The Office would expect to see from him, but you know what, I liked this movie. Carell stars as Dan Burns, a widowed father who's daughters don't really like him. One weekend, him and his daughters travel down to see his family. While there, he goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman. When he gets back to his house, he finds out that his brother Mitch(Played by Dane Cook) is dating this woman(Played by Juliette Binoche).Dan in real life, at times, I found a bit unbelievable. Are the Burns family really the kind of people who do exercises together and play board games together and do a bunch of other family things? I would highly doubt that.

It's drama, comedy, romance, with adults and supposedly real characters.Steve Carell stars as Dan, a widower, father of three daughters, newspaper writer, and as implied by widower - he's single. I really liked Carell's performance as Dan, he is genuinely funny, and all-around a good character.The problem is Dan falls in love with Marie (Juliette Binoche). This is a major problem for two reasons. The first, in the theatrical sense of needing to build a conflict, Marie is the girlfriend of Dan's brother. The usual awkwardness and brotherly conflicts ensue. The second problem is that they don't show the audience that Marie has any likable qualities. I found Marie to be a liar, not nearly as smart as Dan, fake, insincere and unattractive (although that is of course in the eye of the beholder). And she is somehow able to get the brothers to fall for her. They were trying to tell me that Dan felt a connection with Marie but they never showed me how.I found every scene with Marie (which is most of the movie) to be in hell, not in real life.

Dan may have found true love again but it turns out that the woman has just started seeing his womanizing brother, who as it turns out, is really infatuated with her and seems to be in love.The flick can't hide the fact that all of this is quite sugar coated. Sure, we have moments where Dan's daughters are furious with him, he makes a complete ass of himself in his clumsy attempts to flirt with the woman he likes but ""real life"" doesn't pan out like this.Carell is a joy to watch as Dan.

Conversely, the nearly improbable or a surprise reveals nearly infinite information or value. In ""Dan in Real Life"", Steve Carell's Dan in a moment of cathartic surrender says that we always ask young people what is their plan in life, when we should tell them ""Plan to be surprised"" Life is all about wonder and surprise. Writer and director Peter Hedges's ""Dan in Real Life"" is very sweet and the surprise of the year. Hedges and co-writer Pierce Gardner's lyrically comfortable story acknowledges the predictable, but is all about the journey that reveals the surprise.Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, an advice columnist for a New Jersey newspaper whose column is on the verge of national syndication. Although able to advise others, Dan is suffering in restrained turmoil. He is a grieving widower raising three young daughters: 17 year-old Jane (Alison Pill), rebellious teenager Cara (Brittany Robertson), and youngest Lily (Marlene Lawston). Jane dreads that she is getting inadequate driving time for her license, and secretly wants to go away for college next fall. Cara has found her true love after three days, much to the chagrin of her Dad. Lily pretty much follows her older sisters, but is all for her Dad. Dan's late wife was the great love of his life, and he does not expect miracles to happen twice. Dan has not dated since his wife's death. Consequently, he dedicates his life to his daughters. In a nice scene Dan prepares his girls' lunches lovingly cutting the crust off the peanut and jelly sandwiches. Despite his selfless intentions all is not going well. We get that part of the deal is that Dan is suffering in spite of the up beat facade. And his daughters know.In complete upset Dan and the girls drive to Rhode Island for a Holiday family gathering at his parent's house. The senior Burns' are wonderfully played by Dianne Wiest and John Mahoney. Following his Mother's order to take a break, Dan meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) at a bookstore on the coast. Dan and Marie spend a miraculous afternoon together. Marie departs telling Dan that she is currently involved and has a social obligation. Back at the Burns compound Dan tells his brothers, ""I met somebody, and she is really something."" At the same time the family is waiting to meet younger brother Mitch's (charming funny Dane Cook) new girlfriend. Marie is Mitch's new girl friend, and she immediately wins over the Burns family. What does Dan do? His brother's girl friend is his soul mate.Steve Carell is spectacular. As Dan he understandably behaves as a jerk in Marie's presence. Juliette Binoche is quietly beautiful and compelling, and the embers smoldering between her and Carell have an authentic resonance. Carell is hysterical and vulnerable as Dan makes the best of a no win situation. It is the little details that Director Hedges does so well. Daughter Jane (radiant Alison Pill) warns her Dad about making a pass at Marie, reminding Dan ""I'm 17. Okay..."" Emily Blount (""The Devil Wears Prada) is brilliant and sexy as Dan's blind date Ruthie Draper, who awakens Marie's ire. Carell touchingly silences the audience as he secretly sings to Marie, ""Let my love open the door to your heart."" ""Dan in Real Life"" is all heart. What is not surprising is that ""Dan in Real Life"" is about life and true lovethe real surprise in life. Steve Carell is amazing. Perhaps his performance will not be overlooked during awards season. Juliette Binoche is the wise and compassionate muse. Peter Hedges poignantly with a sense of humor enrolls us to ""Plan to be surprised""in life. After all, that's all there is.",Dan in Real Life
52,cultfilmfan,Dan In Real Life,6,27 October 2007,"Dan In Real Life is about a newspaper advice columnist named Dan Burns. Dan is a single father who lives with his three daughters. Dan and the girls don't always get along and the next thing you know they are at a family reunion with Dan's parents, brothers, sisters and nieces and nephews. While visiting his extended family Dan meets a woman named Marie at a bookstore and immediately they have a connection with one another. They agree to phone each other and that very day at his parent's house, Dan discovers that the reason he couldn't be more than friends with Marie is because unbeknownst to both of them Dan realizes she is dating his brother Mitch and Marie discovers that Dan is his brother. Things soon become complicated and during the week they soon learn that they love each other more, but don't necessarily know how to handle the whole situation and meanwhile Dan also has to look out for his three girls and not let on to Mitch that he loves Marie. The premise for Dan In Real Life isn't exactly a new formula, but it still could have possibly been interesting, but unfortunately it wasn't. For instance I personally didn't like the character of Dan at all. When the film first starts out you assume that because he is an advice columnist that he must be a sweet and sensitive guy, but during those few days with his family and around Marie he personally goes out of his way to spite her and make her feel jealous and for the majority of the film I found him to be a really self absorbed and immature character who should probably take some of his own advice to heart. I just felt at times that he was a really nasty and selfish character who by the end of the film we all know will change, but by that time I had already stopped caring. The whole thing with Dan being in love with Marie and her loving Mitch also wasn't handled as I would've liked and without giving things away it wasn't a particularly calm and everything works out for everyone film and I almost found that because of Dan's personality that the film had a mean streak in it that does not work well for a film that also tries to be a film about family and a light-hearted film as well. This film just did not work for me and even from the beginning without having gotten to know Dan yet the film never really grabbed me, or kept me interested at all. It has a slower pace to it and it just wasn't all that interesting a film and I didn't feel it worked as a comedy or a romance. Steve Carell who usually plays likable, or at least funny characters didn't warm up to me in this and because of his character and the weak script I can't recommend this film at all.",Dan in Real Life
53,Danusha_Goska,Carell is Brilliant. Pity About the Rest of the Movie,5,13 July 2008,"Steve Carell is brilliant in ""Dan in Real Life""  sexy, handsome, understated, really, truly, Cary Grant like. Pity about the rest of the film.Dan (Carell) is a columnist in love with his brother's girlfriend. He's on vacation in his family's vacation home. His family members are supposed to be progressive, upper middle class, very groovy people. They are very much like ""The Family Stone"" in the movie of that name.In fact though, this family is unbearable. Dan has three daughters. The oldest is a preachy, busy-body, know-it-all, prematurely middle-aged meddler. The middle daughter is a vicious nymphomaniac. The youngest hasn't yet decided what her kink will be; she tests out being a b---- like her middle sister, or a scold like her oldest sister. These daughters are so nauseating I was really hoping, after about ten minutes of their antics, that the movie would go totally of the rails.The romantic comedy aspect would just stop, and terrorists would invade the plot, and carry Dan's daughters off to a cave in Afghanistan, where they would be introduced to the joys of whipping, burkas, and child marriage to an eighty year old warlord who already has ten wives. For a film to make a feminist hope for this plot development the daughters have to be pretty obnoxious. And their dad pretty much of a spineless wimp. A carpet. They walk all over him. Spank those girls! On camera! Please! Grow some, buddy! The rest of Dan's family is pretty awful, too. I never thought I could hate Dianne Wiest. She makes Dan sleep in a laundry room. The house looks like a mansion. Is that really the best place they can put him? Plainly, no. We now know where Dan's daughters got their nastiness, and how Dan learned to be a wimp who is mistreated by females. Paging ""The Exorcist."" The brothers get a kick out of making fun of a girl who looks like a pig. Is this supposed to be heart warming? Yeah. Strange. This family is definitely an acquired taste, one I'd rather not acquire, thank you very much.Watching this movie was like reliving a nightmare. Dan loves his brother's girlfriend. He's locked in the same house with the brother and the girlfriend. Fun! Not.But, really, Carrel is great. The New England seaside scenery is nice.

It was nice to see Britt Robertson in one of her earlier films, she is such a talented actress with so much energy to offer in her parts.

Yea, it is a little corny, but it is actually a good movie. I never thought much of Steve Carrel since I view the show ""The Office"" as one of television's worst programs. But in ""Dan in Real Life"" I was impressed with his acting talent as the controlling, shy, and funny Dan. Juliet Binoche was also a good addition in the film as Dan's romance that is tied up in loving his brother, but also loving him. It is a cute movie that made me chuckle. 7/10",Dan in Real Life
57,bopdog,"The alleged ""family"" did not feel real. A life ""style,"" but life-less. Some bright and warm moments, however",7,26 October 2007,"Again, it is nice to be in the States this autumn/winter, and enjoy movies when they first come out! ""Dan"" is a mixed bag, to be sure. The morose and self-centred Dan character was mostly very annoying. In fact, his three daughters were the only thoroughly admirable people in the whole movie, and they, together with Juliette Binoche's character, were the only totally likable ones. Dianne Wiest and John Mahoney are both great actors, and likable actors, but their parts here were more like stand-ins. I never believed ANY of these people, except the three daughters, were actually related to each other, or had ever really lived together, or shared a single childhood experience. Something that would have made this family, and their alleged past real, was simply missing.The home life at Dan's parents was a bit odd. The house had the look of a ""family manse,"" with two generations of close and full living--- mementos, nick-knacks, and the accouterments of 60 years of rich family living, piled all around. Kids' paintings on the fridge door, faded photos on the wall. Comfy but worn furniture all around. But none of the characters seemed to inhabit any of it. None of them seemed to have actually lived there, let alone grown up there. It was as if these people had snuck in to someone else's house, and were just pretending it was theirs, like models posing for an L.L. Bean catalogue.One felt also an uneasy sense of asking: WHERE did these people come from? Where did the elderly parents even work? It was as if the whole family were models, demonstrating how upper-middle-class family life CAN look on the East Coast of America. A life STYLE, but somehow life-less.That's not to say there weren't some nice moments, even some bright ones. But the mopey, self-absorbed and utterly selfish and stupidly behaving Dan was painful to behold. the fact that this is a romantic comedy kind of telegraphs the type of ending to expect. And I was heartened a bit, and glad, in a way, for the characters by the time the thing was over. But it got there very clumsily, making this an ""OK,"" or maybe even ""good"" movie, when it could/should have been a GREAT movie.",Dan in Real Life
58,Bolesroor,Nothing Real About This Life,4,15 September 2008,"A nebbishy widower meets a beautiful woman and falls in love, but at the family reunion he learns she's his brother's girlfriend. That's the movie, folks.Steve Carell may be the funniest man alive... he is consistently brilliant in ""The Office."" He can find six ways to make you laugh with a single sentence. It's a shame to see him wasted here, moping and bumbling and straining to seem lovesick. Dane Cook is interesting and proves to be a genuinely talented actor. Juliette Binoche is forgettable as the human plot-point. The supporting characters are solid, if a tad familiar.My real problem with this film was the premise: Most people don't fall in love after one breakfast together... and what are the odds that your brother is already dating the girl of your dreams? And that you have to spend a weekend with both of them and your entire family without letting anyone know how you feel? This would have been a great concept for an all-out comedy but ""Dan"" is one of those falsely-advertised downers... you know the drill: You see a commercial starring your favorite comic actors and the film is sold as a gut-busting chuckle-fest. Once inside the theater, however, you get soupy dramedy that fails to be either. Think ""Little Miss Sunshine."" To appreciate the comic genius of Mr. Carell just watch a few episodes of The Office, a show that is, ironically, much closer to real-life.GRADE: C",Dan in Real Life
59,ThurstonHunger,failing the silver screen litmus test...,4,19 April 2009,"I don't know, if Carrel did not have the wildly successful ""Office"" I think his shot at films like these would have been used up. This seemed like an experiment in trying to see if Carrel and Dane Cook can cross over as serious actors. Or well at least actors? For me the answer was a resounding no.I slogged through the film, out of what, I'm not sure. Perhaps some unforeseeable, inexplicable allegiance to the dead wife. To me the scenes with the daughters were the most interesting, and/or most ""real."" In fact, I would have guessed this were written by a woman, my wife also thought so...and yet, unless those are nomme du plumes, we were wrong.And apparently we are wrong with the masses on this one, as I truly thought their was no chemistry between Carrel and Binoche, despite several comments here to the contrary. The film took a little pick up when Binoche's character was allowed to add a tinge of jealousy to her character, and yet the taboo they broke gets handled so tidily, that I never could buy into any real nature of this. Something that would get solved by a punch, a hug and then a new bimbo?? Real life?? I saw a plug by another dissatisfied reviewer for ""Margot at the Wedding"" so I'll bump that up in my queue. At the same time, I'd say if you like love that sprouts in unlikely or unwelcome areas, and I think is done with more authenticity, I'd recommend the earlier foreign films by Susanne Bier.4/10 Thurston Hunger",Dan in Real Life
60,ruby_fff,Sondre Lerche's music & songs is essential to Dan in Real Life - the lyrics express the feel of the story integrally well,8,25 March 2008,"After viewing the DVD of ""Dan in Real Life,"" enjoying the film all over again, I can safely say it is the best film experience for 2007 for me. With the many heavy, intense subject matter films throughout 2007*, 'Dan in Real Life' and 'Lars and the Real Girl' are two films that stood out, emitting light, hope and understanding in human relationships, how we go about our lives and connecting with family and new encounters. May be grand sounding, yet truly down to earth.Liken to Isabelle Huppert in ""I Heart Huckabees"" is Juliette Binoche's vitalizing presence of a French 'siren' in an American romantic comedy film. In ""Dan in Real Life,"" her willingness to have fun and unabashedly acting out in awkward situations/scenarios - such fluid performance 'dancing' opposite talented Carell - is a treat, indeed. The soundtrack by Sondre Lerche (Norwegian), his perfectly framed song lyrics and guitar music are so catchy and aptly casual and rhythmic to the life force revival of central character: Steve Carell's Dan, a widower-single Dad with three daughters, trying to get over grief of his wife's passing 3 years hence, and whether he'd be able to 'love again.' The whole cast of the Burns family members, from mature adults down to young ones ages four to teens, is reminiscent of ""The Family Stone"" with a different heart's delight storyline by w-d Peter Hedges (Pieces of April 2003). What a fun ensemble cast that includes natural thespians Dianne Wiest paired with John Mahoney as Nana and Poppy; Dane Cook (who can be seen as Mr. Smith in ""Mr. Brooks"" opposite Kevin Costner) as Mitch the brother with new lady friend Annie/Marie (Binoche); Dan's three daughters: Alison Pill as Jane (driving to the rescue), Brittany Robertson as Cara (standing by falling in love can be instant), Marlene Lawston as Lilly (the quiet, understanding and caring 8-year old) complement Carell's widower Dad/eldest son/brother admired.The Sondre Lerche's song lyrics are very much a part of the film. Modern Nature: ""Do you have the clue what this is? If things go right we're meant to be. Forget modern nature, this is how it's meant to be."" The telling song titles: To Be Surprised; I'll Be OK; My Hands Are Shaking. And Carell singing: ""Let My Love Open the Door.""

61,departed07,One of those nice comedies that deserves more viewing in the future,8,4 September 2008,"If I thought being an uncle was tough, I should be a single dad just like Dan to see what it's like raising a family all by myself.""Dan In Real Life"" is about a newspaper columnist (Dan played by Steve Carell) who writes advice on his columns but doesn't know how to follow them. Dan Burns is a widower where he faces the responsibility of taking care of his three daughters who each want a sense of independence on their own. His eldest wants to drive after getting her permit but is denied; the middle child wants to experience the joys of falling in love, even though Dan's heart has died, he doesn't want his second child to be with somebody she met for three days; the youngest on the other hand loves her father but she wants him to understand that she has a mind of her own rather than listening to her two eldest sisters.Dan's life starts to begin when he takes his daughters to a family reunion run by his parents where they met the relatives. Despite the fact that Dan's wife is dead, Dan is the joke to most of the family members where they daunt and tease him like bullies to a nerd; but it's just mere child's play since deep down they love him. It isn't when Dan decides to take a trip to a local book store where he meets a lovely woman named Marie played by Juliette Binoche and falls in love with her. The only problem is that when he gets home, Dan sees that Marie is going out with his brother Mitch (Dane Cook) and knows that things have just gotten worse. It'll just be a matter of time when the truth will come out.Overall, I liked ""Dan in Real Life"". It reminded me of another dysfunctional family movie ""The Family Stone"" about a family trying to cope with odd situations and new characters in the family's life. Steve Carell's performance proves that the actor can play any role and yet manages to win us over. It's the type of film that can have second viewings in the future without being offended.",Dan in Real Life
62,diac228,Dan in Real Life: As if we need a reminder that real life sucks.,7,20 November 2007,"Life is full of surprises; there is no denying that. One day you can be figuring out what you'll be doing with your life, and then a curveball gets thrown at you, changing your perspective on life and all that is going on. Dan in Real Life is a mildly successful re-creation of this aspect of life; as we follow a very bitter and depressed man go through an extremely awkward and bittersweet situation that affects him as well as the family around him. There's an old song that best describes this movie: Bittersweet Symphony. While the misleading trailers fail to market this movie as a dramedy, there's still a healthy dosage of comedy within the drama and darker material. Yet even though the acting and pacing are spot-on, the writing and the story in general changes gears far too quickly and derails from what could have been a very good film. Just when you thought you could sit through this entire movie without hitting any clichés, disappointment strikes in the final act. It does not make this movie unwatchable, but prevents it from being something very special.Dan in Real Life follows a depressed, lonely, widowed father of three girls, Dan Burns (Steve Carell), heading to Rhode Island to see his happy family. His three daughters aren't too happy about the trip, and aren't too happy at his stomping on anything that might resemble a relationship. Upon arriving there, he meets a woman in a bookstore and the two hit it off almost instantly. What Dan doesn't know is that the mystery woman, Marie (Juliette Binoche) is the new girlfriend of Dan's brother Mitch (Dane Cook). Now Dan must be under the same roof as his new crush for a couple of days and hide his obvious adoration for her before the family finds out and the situation gets any worse. Does not help that Marie becomes the hit of the household as she perfectly blends in to the mannerisms of the folks in the family. What appeals this movie to the average moviegoer (and myself) is simply the brutal irony of the situation, and the terrible case of awkwardness that follows, its one of the more original dramas in terms of conflict to be released in a long time.The strongest part of this movie is the casting and acting. Resembling perfectly a close and worried family, every person in the family is important, has their moment to shine, and adds a sense of realism to the movie. Steve Carell gives us the best performance in the movie as whether he is talking or not, you can feel his pain and suffer with him. Dane Cook is actually quite bearable in this movie, a rarity considering his track record (Let's try to forget Good Luck Chuck, shall we?). In this movie, Cook is much more admirable, much more down-to-earth, and he does not overact or attempt to resort to his comedic stand-up material. He plays the brother role almost perfectly, but it becomes the fault of the writers when his character changes abruptly in the third act. The lead female, Juliette Binoche, is also superb as the beautiful and delightful Marie. One final note: it is nice to see John Mahoney back with his fatherly roles after Frasier fame.Another strong part of Dan in Real Life is the pacing. The pacing is nice and slow, relatively easygoing and simple to follow. The conflict is presented almost instantly, as well as the introduction to the family that the audience is about to spend the next hour and a half with. Sadly though, despite the chemistry amongst the family, there isn't much of it involving Marie and the competing brothers, neither one can prove their connection with her. Dan In Real Life could have really benefited from more screen time involving Marie and Dan, and Mitch and Dan. The other relationship that lacks chemistry and time is Dan and his daughters; it's a subplot that isn't well developed but concludes perfectly.Bottom Line: Don't let the negative words fool you; we have fine performances and a bittersweet story that the entire family can watch. However, it is a comedy for adults, its something the tykes won't be as engaged in. The movie could have been something really special, if the third act had not been so rushed and if we had a bit more of a running time. Despite those flaws, there are many delightful moments of a close family spending time, helping each other heal, helping each other enjoy life, and staying together no matter what scenario pops up. You can only wish the average American family was this close and joyful. Finally, this movie gives us hopeless romantics optimism that the right person is indeed out there, despite any problematic circumstances. And in life, sometimes, we need to see that sort of light at the end of the lonely tunnel.",Dan in Real Life

Here's my IMDb.com review.Dan (Steve Carrell, in his most touching role since he played Brick in ""Anchorman"") is a widower raising 3 girls while balancing a successful career as an advice columnist. The girls are becoming a handful as one wants to start driving and the other is in a burgeoning relationship. At the peak of some frustrations with each other, the family goes to their annual whole family holiday at Dan's parents house (his parents are played by that old dad in ""Frasier"" and the ageless Dianne Wiest, best known as the mum in ""The Lost Boys""). While visiting the bookstore on a break, Dan runs into Marie (Juliette Binoche) and falls head over heels in love. When he gets back to the home he tells his brothers of what happened at the bookstore and is mortified when Marie turns up at the home too, as the new girlfriend of brother Mitch. Dan is extremely confused about what to do and goes down several paths before making his final decision. Will Dan profess his love or will he honour his brother? Pleasant, enjoyable despite the slightly morally challenging storyline. A few ""convenient"" situations help make the story slightly plausible, which really helped. A good cast and decent story, but Carrell really makes the movie. May remind many (if they had the misfortune of seeing it) of ""The Family Stone"".",Dan in Real Life

It is a pretty decent movie, it works fro both sides, men and women because it has comedy, romance and also a little bit of drama. Perhaps its more a chick flick because of all the topics involving the film. It is funny were it has to be funny. The story is good, the plot about advice columnist Dan Burns is an expert on relationships, but somehow struggles to succeed as a brother, a son and a single parent but maybe a little corny for my taste. It has a very good cast. Steve Carell does a very good performance. Juliette Binoche looking good at her mid 40's and with great acting too and Dane Cook role was convincing enough.

67,nomoons11,One of those films that's just good in every way,8,5 November 2012,"This is one of those films that you see in your que or at the video store that you put on the back burner and try later. Next time you see it, grab it, it'll be so worth your time.I just love everything about this film. It's one that is just got so much heart it just permeates the entire film. Steve Carell is a widower who barely gets by writing his daily column..Dan in Real Life. In the process of doing this he has to raise 3 girls on his own....and according to them he's not doing a very good job. You can tell they love him to tears but they sure give him a hard time. He's a soft touch.Next comes a family get together and in walks in his brothers new girlfriend and he's just floored. They have an obvious connection but they decide to keep it quiet and try to make it through the family get together. The rest of the way through it's the awkwardness of him trying to keep his sanity. He's just gaga over this girl.The amount of funny scenes in this film is just too many to relate. The ones that left me laughing the most were ""the book store"" scene. In walks his brothers girlfriend and he sees her for the first. She thinks he works there and she asks for advice on a certain book. He proceeds to roam around the book store and just randomly pull books off the shelf and tell her way each book is what she needs. After this scene is over you'll laugh completely. This is one of the scenes in a film that sticks with you. So well written and the perfect 2 cast members to pull it off.Not far behind is the the mother and father decide to set up their son with a girl from his old school when he was a kid. Problem is the girl, Ruthie Pigface Draper, wasn't too attractive back then. The whole family decides to needle him before the date...by song. His brothers and family sing a painfully funny tune on piano about Ruthie Pigface Draper. Just so funny. Dane Cook makes this scene a gem.This little gem of a film has so many of those funny/awkward scenes it makes me feel bad for other films that try so hard to be funny, in all the wrong ways. It doesn't hurt that Steve Carell can pull off any role and make it work.At the end you'll have a little tear in your eye but just remember to smile.

68,ritera1,Why?,1,2 September 2008,"I love Steve Carell, but why this? Especially disappointing from a director who has done some very good work.I didn't buy the love story. Why fall in love with this woman when you don't know anything about her? And then she didn't care 'til the bar scene when she suddenly cared with some nonsense and out-of-nowhere friction between the two that spilled over to the next morning with the pancake scene.And who was she? She was well traveled, but that was about it. In the bookstore she comes off like a fiery but uneducated-waitress-type as she was not well read, but then she is this world traveler. What did she do on those travels? I didn't know anything about her.And Carell goes off with the ditzy doctor after the bar scene but we don't know what happened. Did they have sex? Did he bow out like a gentlemen 'cause he loved the other woman? It was just overlooked and not used to his character's advantage.And Carell was a mild-mannered columnist. Did he really like his job? He gets a national column but SUDDENLY has family values in the meeting with the new bosses in the living room. His arc was that he now trusts his daughters. He didn't want the older daughter to drive 'cause he was scared, not like he hated women drivers. And now he trusts his younger daughter to date a guy and believes she's in love? He probably had the right idea at first.I personally didn't care and it all was too nicey-nice and cutesy. Good movies used to be made 'cause good movies made money. Not anymore. I had high hopes for this and was very disappointed. Apparently a generic ""formula"" is now used for dramedys that is used for action films.

Thank GOD this was nothing like the 40-Year-Old Virgin piece of poop. No vulgarity or nastiness. But nothing especially noteworthy, either, as it's just boring chick-flick about a guy who accidentally falls in love with the girl his brother is already dating unbeknownst to him. All of this drama is the plot for the movie. But maybe it was just me because it was never much to get into for me. The family heaves and sighs heavily throughout. Dan proves to be a wuss whipped by his children, whipped by his beloved, whipped by his brother, and stops long enough from apologizing to the world to make deep philosophical statements about love and life. Including the affirmation that his teenage daughter (read brat) whines about throughout the film, hormones are king and you can be ""in love"" with someone in moments if not days.Maybe I'm the only one but I was also confused by the bland blending in of the girlfriend (Marie) with others in the cast. The brother who was supposed to be the wronged lover goes driving off with a look-alike in a car at the end of the movie and you're (at least I wasn't) sure whether that was Marie or a look-alike or where the hell she came from.All in all boring fare. If you're a guy, avoid it like the plague unless it's an excuse to spend time with a woman you care for that you want to know better.

At a large family homecoming Dan meets his perfect woman, only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother.What's a man to do?I rather liked ""Dan In Real Life"", but I would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept Steve Carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained, rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful.

71,moutonbear25,Dan IS real life,8,27 October 2007,"Marie: You are smooth. Dan: No, I'm not smooth. I'm Dan.If you're anything like me, smooth and single do not go together. You see someone you like, rare enough as that can be, and you want to say something but you don't. Or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you've ever said in your life. More often then not though, you stare from afar and admire without having to deal with taking that which most agree is the only way to get anywhere in life  a risk. You can't blame a guy for being a little frightened though. Maybe he's been burned hard before or maybe he's trying to focus all his energy on his career. There are reasons, some valid, some not, and all of them can be interpreted as excuses rather than reason. You tell yourself you don't need it or it isn't the right time for you but you still wish it were happening. Any way you break it down, it's not easy. Sound familiar? If you thought yes even just a little, then DAN IN REAL LIFE, the new comedy from director Peter Hedges, is a must-see. It will reach inside of you and somehow manage to both break and warm your heart all at once.The Dan from the title is Dan Burns (Steve Carell), an advice columnist who is admired for his insight into living a balanced, fulfilling and morally uplifting life. Four years or so before the film opens on Dan waking up to his day, he lost his wife and love of his life. After that tragedy, Dan was left to raise their three daughters alone. Between that and focusing on his career, finding love again was not one of Dan's priorities. And so he became more functional than feeling. Removed from the power of intimacy, Dan no longer knows what it means to be that close to someone and has resigned himself to never knowing that again. That is, until he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a book and tackle shop in Connecticut on a quiet morning. They're interaction is casual, comfortable and it catches both of them off guard. There is only one problem really. She is already seeing someone. Unfortunately for all involved, that someone is Dan's brother, Mitch (Dane Cook). His entire family has come up to their parents' country home for their yearly visit and Dan must now spend the weekend pining and yearning for the fleeting feeling he had with Marie that morning. It only lasted an hour or so but it only took that long to awaken Dan's heart from its coma.With so many family members to deal with (Jack Mahoney and Dianne Wiest are at the helm), DAN IN REAL LIFE does drift away from its grander purpose from time to time. While the cyclone of kids and parents and aunts and uncles makes for trying times for Dan, Hedges also uses it unnecessarily as a means to distract, with the presumption that it would ultimately make for a more complete film. Luckily, Hedges has got Carell to carry the heavy burden. It is a pleasure to watch Steve Carell come into his own more and more with every picture he makes (despite the occasional EVAN ALMIGHTY-sized misstep). He is charismatic, charming and obviously a sharp humorist. As Dan, he is also self-deprecating, awkward and scared. Carell is the rare comedian who pushes himself to find character in his roles rather than rely solely on his comedic instincts and established persona. Perhaps more importantly, he is entirely relatable as Dan. Whether he's flopping down on the cot in the laundry room where he is subjected to sleep as the only single adult at this reunion or fidgeting around the kitchen, unable to stan d still in his anxiety, Dan is every guy who has even been unsure of himself and felt alone in the crowd. Carell gives Dan so much heart that he becomes the heart of the film itself at the same time.I wondered after seeing the film if I enjoyed the it as much as I did, despite its slight shortcomings (Juliette Binoche  I know you might like to lighten up every now and then but I don't recommend it unless there is chocolate involved), because of where I am in my life. Would someone who has found that someone else derive as much meaning and comfort from this film? I can't say. What I can say, as someone who knows what it means to be lonely, DAN IN REAL LIFE knows what it means to be surprised by life and love and how these moments and people need to be appreciated and cherished. It also knows that anyone who might be feeling lonely on any given day or for months at a time needs to be reminded that surprises still happen.",Dan in Real Life

Dan is on cloud nine until he learns the woman is dating his brother, Mitch (Dane Cook).Director and co-writer Peter Hedges establishes the kind of guy Dan is from the opening scene where we see him still sleeping on his side of the bed and taking excellent care of his girls. Sympathy is immediately evoked for Dan as he fights his attraction to the woman, but can't. The story takes an odd turn when Dan's parents arrange a blind date for him and Mitch's girlfriend is clearly jealous.Hedges' direction is spirited and Carell is backed by a wonderful supporting cast led by John Mahoney and Dianne Wiest as Dan's parents...two very classy people whose love for their son keeps them from coming right out and letting him know when he's screwing up. Dane Cook, who I usually can't stand, is almost likable as Mitch. Leo Norbert Butz has some funny moments as Dan's other brother, as does Emily Blunt as Dan's blind date. Also loved Brittany Robertson as Dan's middle daughter, Cara.The film's primary faux pas is the casting of Oscar winner Juliette Binoche as the object of Dan's affections. Light comedy is just not Binoche's long suit and her performance is just as annoying as her character becomes when she sees Dan with another woman. Not to mention the fact that the on screen chemistry between Carell and Binoche was nonexistent.Lovely cinematography and a lilting song score by Sondre Lerche help, but it is the casting of Binoche that keeps this film from being the very special film that it almost is.",Dan in Real Life
74,jace_the_film_guy,"High-Quality, yet Simple, Dramatic Comedy",8,16 July 2021,"Dan in Real Life is a high-quality, yet simple, dramatic comedy. Rather than play off the overused Steve Carell physical comedy accompanied with accents and outbursts, this film subtly uses his skills as a profound actor.The casting was spot-on, the music was beautifully crafted and the movie was real. Some might say that it is boring, but for me those slower moments further develop the entire purpose of the film. It is not titled ""Crazy Family Vacation"" or ""My Brother's Girlfriend"", rather it is Dan in Real Life. The film has real moments, with real people trying to traverse tragedy and real life.",Dan in Real Life
75,brian_r_wright,Romantic comedy with an awkward family focus,7,7 January 2009,"The story all washes out eventually in typical romantic-comedy fashion. Carell is just about perfect for this kind of role. So good, in fact, that I have a hard time watching much of the movie for its authentic discomfiture. But Juliette Binocheoriginally a French actress who hit the big time in English-speaking movies, winning an Oscar for best supporting actress in The English Patient (1997) and being nominated for best actress in Chocolat (2003)probably saves the film from what else might be a formulaic Hollywood jaunt with brand name actors. (John Mahoney and Dianne Wiest make smaller contributions by turning in performances that in lesser hands might detract.) And the youngsters do fine. With young actors, one never knows who will climb from an inauspicious child role to the pinnacles of the profession. ...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2008",Dan in Real Life
76,The_Orenda,A Murderer of Love?,2,4 May 2008,"With the exception of one sentence, of a screaming teenage daughter at that, Dan in Real Life pretty much sponges up 100 minutes of your time. A comedy with lacking character and wasted talent. For myself, I find it interesting in noting that this has been Dane Cook's best performance yet and was the only real character of note next to Steve Carell's extremely low-tone, low-key role as the father of three daughters.As Carell wraps a leash around his daughters, the script winds itself up tight to the point of no return. The dialog lacks wit, and Carell carries more despair than charm in his character. Being surrounded in a family house at Thanksgiving might introduce humor, but instead we find angst and anger. The film is strangely one big depressing downer, as Dan torments himself and his daughters as he comes to terms with love and whatever befell his daughters' mother. As far as romantic comedies go, Dan in Real Life has no real niche in its genre, nor in any other for that matter.",Dan in Real Life
77,a.lampert,Disappointment from Steve Carell,3,22 November 2020,"The 7 rating on here is misleading. It does make me wonder about the stream of 10 stars and if they are genuine or written by people with a commercial interest. Not that it's all bad, it does have lots of pretty actresses in it. These are girls and women I shall never apply the current term 'actors' to, no, they are actresses. Even the politically correct Oscar academy hasn't figured out a way around that one yet. Juliette Binoche, Emily Blunt, Alison Pil, Dianne Wiest are a pleasure to observe but the script is dire. I can actually add that it made me feel uncomfortable at times when it was supposed to be making me laugh as it was billed as a comedy. Steve Carell does his best with the unfunny and embarrassing script but even he can't save it. As romcoms go I can only give it 3 for the ladies mentioned. Does anyone have that number of people living in their house? I looked at that perfect dinner table and wondered who served all those meals up. Afterwards they all burst into a perfect choreographed dance routine on the lawn, but this supposed to be Dan in Real Life, not a Broadway musical. Other times it just sagged and dragged.",Dan in Real Life
78,jaddison383,A Lesson in Romantics,8,12 March 2008,"Steve Carrell, that leading man of comedy, is so often pushed aside as another silly comedian. 'Dan in Real Life' proves once again that he is something more rare: a real actor with heart. He plays Dan Burns, a widowed father of three girls who writes a daily advice column for the newspaper. Every year, his large family gets together at their parents gorgeous lake house to help shut it down. This year there will be a special visitor...'Dan in Real Life' is a treasure, a film that both parents and kids can love. The rest of the cast is all excellent, particularly Juliette Binoche as the woman Dan falls for, sending his life into disarray. The ""family"" all works together wonderfully and their talking and bickering feels very real and never forced. Other highlights include Alison Pill, Dianne Wiest, Emily Blunt, and Dane Cook in a surprisingly good performance.The reason 'Dan' excels above the rest is that, much like it's wonderful leading lady and man, it is mature and honest. The comedy never seems forced or ridiculous, instead we laugh because we can so relate to all their family's quirks. And the romance? It's been years since I've seen something so real portrayed in the movies. 'Dan in Real Life' is a lesson in romantics for all ages. You can't even begin to understand love. It's surprising. It's confusing. It's awkward. And yes, it's hilarious. This movie should also stand as a lesson to other films: This is what a great romantic comedy is all about! 8/10 stars!Jay Addison",Dan in Real Life
79,simonparker1990,Surprisingly funny little movie,9,13 January 2008,"Dan in Real Life was one of those very rare films which I walked into knowing absolutely nothing about. I hadn't seen the trailer, I knew nothing about the plot, the extent of my knowledge was basically that Steve Carell was in the movie. I also have to admit I went into this movie begrudgingly, I personally wanted to see Charlie Wilson's War, but my friend wanted to watch this, and as I had made him endure Bee Movie (he hated that movie) I decided it was his turn to pick a film. And for once he chose very well, when you compare this to his previous choices (Epic Movie, The Dark is Rising etc). Dan in Real Life is a sweet, surprisingly believable, well acted drama/comedy which is full of highly memorable scenes and also in some way actually does touch you. This is the first movie since Knocked Up in which I actually cried with laughter, that was an impressive feat for a movie I had pretty much never heard of. Sure the movie does have its flaws, clichéd doesn't even cover the ending and at times the family does seem a bit unbelievable, I am sorry but I have never, ever heard of a real family sitting together to do a crossword puzzle! But these are mere quibbles as you cannot help but come out of this movie smiling and feeling a bit better about yourself. Of course this isn't for everybody, people who went into this movie expecting to see Carell on his annoying over the top form would leave this movie bitterly disappointed, trust me I saw some kids walk out and laughed to myself as they obviously just expected another Evan Almighty.The performances of this movie absolutely hit the right note. Dan in Real Life sees Carell on top form, and by that I seriously mean he deserves an Oscar nomination for this performance. He is slightly wacky, but he's believable, and his slow descent into a depression is amazing to behold. This performance is even better than he was in Little Miss Sunshine and trust me that a lot for me to say that! Juliette Binchoe is equally as impressive as Marie. Thankfully as well Carell and Binoche have incredible chemistry so the pairs relationship always feels believable. Dane Cook was also a pleasant surprise in this movie. I might have hated Employee of the Month, my first encounter with the actor, but Good Luck Chuck wasn't bad, but this is just spectacular from him. He seems to have finally found his feet as an actor, and based on this performance it looks like he could have some great roles ahead. The three lead girls are all perfect and actually believable children, especially Marlene Lawston as Lily, you just want to scoop her up and take her home she is so adorable. In fact all the actors and actresses in this movie are impressive, not one is ever irritating or out of place, they all work perfectly in unison and that is a very rare thing to find in a movie these days. Oh and Emily Blunt, is absolutely hilarious, you know how good she was in Devil Wears Prada, she's even better in this and she has about five minutes of screen time! Dan in Real Life works best because of its sense of humour as well as its more emotional side. In terms of comedy this reminded more of Little Miss Sunshine than any of Carell's other previous work. The movie seems to be more wacky than anything else, and had humour ranging from small little chuckles, to laughs where you are literally crying with laughter. Carell's dancing sequence is absolutely hilarious and Dane Cook gets a lot of laughs. But the movie works best with its subtle humour, the humour that makes you read in-between the lines. This is when the movie truly finds its ground, the middle section of the movie is just a delight to watch as it is so funny. The movie is also very touching, the fact you actually believe Dan could be a real character makes you more attached to him in the film. You also tend to agree with what he is doing, although at times how he treats his kids is a bit questionable. The movie is essentially about Dan's depression, and rather than the movie treating it very melodramatically the depression seems realistic and the movie is careful with the topic, rather than laughing at Dan we laugh with Dan. As I've said before this isn't perfect, the movies beginning is extremely dull and did make me worry that I had let myself in for another P.S. I Love You (if you missed my review it is one of the most boring films I have ever seen!), thankfully when the film gets round to meeting the family the film picks up its pace and you start to enjoy yourself. Also the movies ending is a bit too clichéd for my liking.Dan in Real Life is a surprisingly brilliant, if not perfect little comedy, that so far has impressed me most this year (although when you see the other movies I've seen so far that doesn't really compliment the film too much). This is the type of film you can watch in a foul mood but end up smiling because of how nice the film is. If you want a nice bit of gentle entertainment this is for you, definitely worth watching and hopefully Carell will do a lot more movies like this in the future.",Dan in Real Life
80,twilliams76,Hollywood REALISM at its best,7,14 July 2011,"What makes Dan in Real Life so special is how ""real"" it feels. Hollywood likes giving audiences contrived and unbelievable movie families; but they actually got it right with Dan in Real Life as these are the kinds of experiences I have with my family over long-weekends (and short ones).A surprisingly ""mature"" and dramatic Steve Carell (""The Office"", Get Smart, The 40 Year Old Virgin) plays an advice columnist widower/father of three daughters who heads to Rhode Island for their yearly ""long weekend"" of meeting-up with family as they help shut-up/down the summer beach house for the season. His parents, siblings and their spouses and all of his nieces and nephews partake of this ""together-time"" and it is the little family interactions that make the film endearing (pancake breakfasts, crossword challenges, football on the lawn).John Mahoney (""Frasier"", Primal Fear, The Iron Giant) and Dianne Wiest (Edward Scissorhands, Bullets Over Broadway, Footloose) play the believable parents of the clan while Dane Cook (Mr. Brooks, Good Luck Chuck, Waiting ...) doesn't embarrass himself as Dan's youngest sibling who's current girlfriend (Juliette Binoche - Chocolat, The English Patient, Cache) catches his older brother's eye (to near-disastrous results). A ""hideous"" Emily Blunt (The Young Victoria, The Devil Wears Prada, The Muppets) gives a nice turn as former ugly-duckling, Ruthie Draper, who gets her very own highly-inspired piano serenade that'll surely produce some smiles. Playing Dan's oldest daughter is Alison Pill (Milk, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Pieces of April) who's character again proves that a well-brought-up-child is something to be proud of.Dan in Real Life is a weekend-in-the-life of someone any of us could know -- and it is a film I can easily watch again and again. The family plays together and exercises together. They have interesting conversation at the dinner table involving corn (!). Hollywood got this family right and the entire cast should be lauded/commended! It is pancake breakfast and flannel PJs in a warm kitchen good.",Dan in Real Life
81,Gambitt,Simply terrible,4,30 August 2010,"Dan in Real life was a shallow, contrived, and unfunny disappointment. The characters were cardboard clichés and the plot was forced and absurd. I am baffled by other viewers' references to ""adult"" humor or ""mature"" comedy in Dan in Real Life. If Dan in Real Life reflects ""adult"" humor,"" then I hope I never grow up, because the jokes were obvious, predictable, and above all not funny. And frankly, not very mature. Are masturbation jokes more sophisticated when made by older, white people in a middle-class setting? Does cruelly teasing a person's physical appearance constitute highbrow humor because an entire family joyfully engages in it?The final crime in this movie is the director's insistence on use of the musical montage. No need to actually write meaningful dialogue that develops the characters and builds relationships. Instead, just play hokey music while showing them moving their lips and gesticulating with interlaced images to show the passage of time. Guess what, folks? This is a SCAM of a movie. It's vacuous and lazy movie-making. It fools the viewers into filling in the void and inventing the characters in their own minds.",Dan in Real Life
82,fdbjr,Frustrating,7,20 October 2007,"I saw this movie tonight, and was really frustrated. There was a real effort here to create a family environment that was genuinely warm and mutually supportive. A lot of the dialog is natural and open and enormously compelling.Unfortunately, a lot of it isn't. There is also a serious deficiency in wit. The inevitable conflicts between the hero and his two teenage daughters pay off in too few good jokes. Neither are the comic opportunities between the hero and his larger family exploited enough. The comedy is not exactly a failure, but it could be so much richer. Finally, two of the key scenes - the 'meet cute' scene and the father's summarizing of events to his daughters - are two of the flattest in the movie.But the worse criticism is that Juliet Binoche, whom I admire enormously, is simply miscast in this part.All that said, I LIKED this movie. There were some wonderfully tender scenes, and Carrell is flat out terrific, projecting am almost Jimmy Stewart likability. I also liked Diane Wiest and John Mahoney as his parents, and all three of the actresses who play his daughters. If the script had just had a little more edge, this would have been one great movie. As it is, it is simply a pleasant, occasionally touching family/romantic comedy.",Dan in Real Life
83,Manal1987,Brilliant love/family drama,9,13 May 2011,"Brilliant! I was touched in every possible way. I don't know whether it was Carell's mature and rounded performance, Binoche's sweetness, the story's touch on family and love issues, the script's wit, or the harmony among the cast that made me love it so much. I know that the story is quite regular and predictable, but isn't life so sometimes?! You might fall in love with this movie and watch it again and again, or find it extremely boring and silly and hate it to death. However, you should know that this is the kind of movie that will make you smile and frown, laugh and cry, appreciate whatever your family has given you, and re-evaluate the concept of love.

84,BOUF,Pleasant romcom only marred by mis-matched leads,7,5 August 2008,"The standard romcom structure ensures that the intended lovers are kept apart as long as possible. This particularly works in the favour of this warm, witty slice of white Americana, because I was never really convinced that there was any chemistry between lead characters Dan and Marie. Perhaps it's just me, but I got the feeling Ms Binoche was rather baffled by Mr Carrel's robotic behaviour. In fact I think Marie would have been better off with Dan's brother - with whom she began. There's also a glaring inconsistency: Dan's brother sings a very confident impromptu blues at one stage in the film, then later he's barely capable of holding a tune. Otherwise it's a sweet movie, with all the supporting players doing what they should. But I wonder if Steve Carrel is really the right choice for a romantic lead.",Dan in Real Life
85,writerasfilmcritic,Putrid Schmaltz Taken to the Level of Abject Obscenity,1,6 September 2008,"Before I start tearing this piece of rotten slop a new one, let me first admit that I didn't see the whole picture. There is no way on earth that I could physically sit through even half of it. I was taking a nap when my wife put this drivel on the DVD player after I'd seen the first twenty minutes the night before and tossed it aside with disgust. I awoke from my nap, hearing all sorts of noise. It sounded like they were having a block party outside the house, but no, it was this incredibly sick movie turned up a tad too loud out in the living room. The so-called extended ""family"" it featured were having some sort of non-stop romp outdoors, so I got up and sat down to see just what the old lady found so darn interesting that she had to wake me up in the middle of some much-needed sleep. My senses were assaulted right from the start. Some youthful brat with her hip-hugger pants down so low that half her butt was showing was deeply and passionately in love with some cow-eyed hispanic kid and her spineless dad thought he ought to intervene (perhaps to keep her from being knocked-up within the next week). He sends Romeo packing for home and his daughter runs after the car, screaming and crying. She falls down, suicide her only option at this point, then screams back at Pop, ""You're a murderer of love!"" Say what? Are they serious? Proving that it actually WAS possible, the flick went seriously downhill from there. We watch as this excuse for a father goes from daughter to sister to mother being told what a complete nebbish he is (just for being male, it seems) and he sucks it all in and keeps asking for more. I wanted to vomit. The oh-so-sensitive look in his eyes made me want to smash him right in the face. Geez, I thought that sort of muck went out when being ""an achingly sensitive guy"" was all the rage, you know, before even the most ardent feminists got sick of all the spineless yuppie wimps who took their nonsense sitting down and never stood up like a half a man. I had to keep pausing the DVD player to voice my extreme displeasure. Talk about matriarchy, it was enough to make a guy blow chunks for ten minutes, straight. The girls give Pop a scrap book containing a pic of his tragically dead wife. You expect him to start sobbing but he ""manfully"" holds back the tears and just looks more sensitive than before. Boy, that thoughtful gesture really got to him. I forgot to mention the worst part of all. After the interminable football game, or whatever it was that woke me up, they have an amateur hour indoors in which all the little brats and their incredibly forgettable parents perform for one another in full costume. At his brother's urging, Dad and bro do a duet on the guitar, and although bro just can't seem to remember the words, Pop knows every last line by heart, then for the chorus at the end, bro is suddenly inspired. Apparently, the song expresses his innermost feelings like nothing in his silly life ever has before. He's twisting and turning and shouting out those poignant words like there's no tomorrow. Don't get your hopes up, though, because the fun's far from over. As if that weren't bad enough, then comes a game of charades. Bro's love interest has had enough of this silly nonsense and tries to escape with bro hot on her heels trying to persuade her to stay. Ya see, she really has the hots for Dad instead of Dad's bro. Life is complicated and inconvenient that way. The entire family lines up at the window and watches the tearful parting of the mismatched couple. You'd think somebody in that godawful brood might realize that privacy is required now and then, but no, not in that house, where everyone needs to know every tiny detail about everyone else just to make sure nobody gets away with any proscribed individualism. Dad sneaks off after his brother's girl in his Volvo station wagon and they meet at a bowling alley where they have the place all to themselves. The manager even dims the lights just for them because they are making such a commotion that it would be really embarrassing if anyone else saw them do it. You'd think the management might object to their throwing bowling balls all over the place, but no, they're having too much fun and this must be a special bowling alley that's in business just for them. Wait! You guessed it. In comes the family and bro is royally irked that Dad stole his girl. We already know he's really emotional by the way he belted out that Bee Gees song, so he punches Dad right in the nose. That was all I could take. Out of the DVD player came this disgusting, schmarmy piece of tripe and it's going' right back to the library to serve as an emetic for someone else. Anyone who thinks this horrible movie is good ought to be taken out to the nearest field and executed.",Dan in Real Life
86,madbandit20002000,Dan Burns: The Advice Man Who Needs Help,9,22 January 2010,"Mature comedies are hard to come by. Sure, I'm a sucker from outrageous, ribald fare, especially Kevin Smith's work (being profane and profound at once), but it's okay to like the smart, humble and goofy sort like ""Dan In Real Life"", a tale that shows growing up can be soothing and stir crazy.A good man to the letter, who's hoping to be syndicated nation-wide , advice columnist Dan Burns (the reliable Steve Carrell of ""The Office"", US version) buries himself in the role of family patriarch after her beloved wife's passing, but his eldest daughter, Jane (Allison Pill of ""Milk""), is eager to drive; his middle one, Cara (Britt Robertson of ""Life Unexpected""), is passionately lovesick for a boy from school and his youngest one, Lilith (Marlene Lawson), is a precocious old soul.Dan hopes to quench their feelings by taking them to the annual family reunion/vacation in Rhode Island. He has his own budding feelings, though. They're romantic, and they're for Anne-Marie (modest Oscar winner Juliette Binoche), a world traveler who happens to be the current conquest of Dan's lothario, fitness-training sibling, Mitch (comic Dane Cook), putting Dan in emotional angst and wacky situations. It's hard to get back on the love bike, when you're off it for a long while.Co-writing the script with Pierce Gardner, director Peter Hedges (""Pieces of April"") has a familiar but able yarn on his hands that's warm as a sweater. Carrell's surprisingly funny and morose as a man who's afraid of change, trying to avoid it within himself and his children, but it's no use. If not for the material's exterior, Carrell could have been an Oscar contender. Binoche compliments him, not being the stereotypical ""dream girl"", but the earthy bookworm, who's impressed by him after she mistakes him as a bookstore clerk and he goes along with it. Cook's sly but familiar as an overgrown teen. Pill, Robertson and Lawson are sitcom-cute, but deep in their roles.I wish there was more of Dan's extended family, a big, blue-state clan ( Dan's adopted niece is Asian) that has fun by having crossword puzzles contests within gender camps and perform talent shows, but the film's 98 minutes seems enough. John Mahoney (""Say Anything"", ""Frasier"") and two-time Oscar holder Dianne Wiest (""Hannah and Her Sisters"", ""Bullets Over Broadway"") nicely hold the family glue as the elders. Emily Blunt (""Sunshine Cleaning, ""The Young Victoria"") has a fun bit as a family friend, whose pre-plastic surgery reputation inspires a politically incorrect but giggle-inducing song performed by Cook and Norbert Leo Butz, who plays sib Clay. The music by Norwegian Sondre Lerche is soft, smoothing pancake syrup, and it might remain with you after the film's done.Though paint-by-numbers at times, ""Dan In Real Life"" juggles, without a pause, comedy, drama and love. The last one, noted by Cara's boyfriend, after he's sent away for crashing the Burns's party, is not a feeling, it's an ability. It's fun and heart-aching to see how Dan regains it.",Dan in Real Life

We were so glad that we went because it was really laugh out loud funny and it's one of those romantic movies that really is just wonderful. It's not all gushy and boring. It is really romantic and funny. There was a couple next to me and her boyfriend was laughing out loud and enjoying it because let's face it, It's Steve Carell's year and he can do anything and do no wrong. I'm not a big fan of Dane Cook but I really enjoyed him in this movie. He was so good in it. Norbet Leo Butz who's my sister's favorite and the other members of the family were casted perfect and they all did a wonderful job especially Diane Wiest and John Mahoney who looks great by the way. The daughters I was extremely impressed with. They casted them perfectly and Alison Pill who I've seen in so many movies is so talented and Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston were both wonderful to watch and were perfect. No characters were overlooked or two small but Steve was in his element and came through so amazing. Juliette Binoche who I loved in Chocolate was amazing and this was no exception. She did so well in her role and Emily Blunt was a big surprise but she was fantastic. The movie is really a family movie, there's nothing bad in it words, sexual content etc... but it's one where you would enjoy at home or in the theater and with the people who you love and like to spend time with. Recommended for anyone who loves a good movie!~!",Dan in Real Life
88,raymond_chandler,Terrible movie that tries way too hard,2,19 December 2012,"I am rating ""Dan in Real Life"" a 3/10, only because Emily Blunt shows up halfway through and does a sexy dance in a bar. Otherwise, this movie is boring, schmaltzy tripe that completely wastes a cast of pretty good actors. It is very poorly written, and directed with a sledgehammer to the forehead of the audience. There is no subtext or subtlety anywhere. Every scene is played in the most obvious way possible, with zero complexity to any of the characters.I must admit I gave up halfway through the movie, it is SO BAD. The plot is recounted elsewhere, so I will pick two examples of why I hated it.When Dan (Steve Carrell) arrives at his family reunion, he finds that the ""hottie"" he spent the morning talking to at a deserted coffee stand is in fact his brother's new girlfriend, Anne-Marie (Juliette Binoche). They stare at each other in disbelief for what seems like an eternity. It would be impossible for everyone else in the room not to pick up on their previous acquaintance, but no one notices. So much for ""real life"".Later, after an interminable sequence of uncomfortable scenes of the Stepford family, Dan ends up at a bar with Anne-Marie, his brother Dane Cook (Anne-Marie's boyfriend), and Emily Blunt at her hottest as an old acquaintance of Dan's, despite about a 20-year age difference. She (Emily's character) makes a play for Dan, and Anne-Marie becomes visibly jealous, although the entire relationship between A-M and Dan consists of one conversation, dominated by Dan. No subtlety, the director gives us several shots of Juliette's character shooting daggers from her eyes. Just like that, she appears to have no interest at all in Dane Cook, although they are in an ongoing relationship. Not at all how people behave in ""real life"".I could not watch any more after this. I will say, to the movie's credit, that it does not stoop to crude toilet humor, which has become the norm in American ""comedy"" nowadays (I am looking at you, Judd Apatow). It tries to develop warm, relationship-based situations, but the script and directing are so incredibly trite and in-your-face, the movie becomes downright painful to watch.",Dan in Real Life
89,MovieDude1893,A Surprisingly Enjoyable and Charming Comedy,8,24 November 2007,"Steve Carell has seemed to get over his momentary lapse in judgment (Evan Almighty)and gone back to something he can do and do extremely well. What Carell can do is effortlessly portray a likable everyman.In 'Dan in Real Life', Carell is asked to do just that, he plays Dan Burns a man who is four years removed from losing his wife, yet still manages to raise his three daughters and write his weekly advice column. Currently, Dan is preparing to go on his family's annual weekend reunion. Meanwhile, two of Dan's three daughters are loathing him. Meanwhile, at a local bookstore, Dan encounters the beautiful and charming Marie (Juliette Binoche). However, she factors into Dan's life in more ways than he thinks. The love triangle the film creates is not treading any new ground. We know from the first sign of trouble how the events will transpire. Nevertheless, Dan in Real Life still manages to charm its way into our hearts because its performers are so good and its characters are not bad people. At heart they are good people, normal people. This film has drawn many comparisons to last year's 'The Family Stone' however I think that previous feature was handicapped by attempting to make its characters zany. Dan in Real Life allows its actors to portray real people. This is a welcome change for Dane Cook as Dan's brother, who dials it down to bearable in this film. This is essentially cinematic comfort food, it tastes good as its going down and leaves you with a smile.",Dan in Real Life
90,marimbadaddy,The Old Bait and Switch,3,25 November 2009,"This movie is a sheer and utter disappointment. The cast features two fantastic comedic actors with Steve Carell and Dane Cook. The poster also tries to fool the audience into thinking they are going to watch a comedy. Unfortunately, the truth is far from that and suddenly one realizes they've been suckered into a painful drama with only hints of comedic moments.I really felt for Carrel's character, he was quite sympathetic, and his ""real life"" problems were ones that most adults can identify with. I also really despised Cook's character, as he was such a douche-bag. I believe they were good performances. There was a bit too much telegraphing of the plot, which made the movie feel extremely arduous throughout. However, the ending is satisfying, so one doesn't end up feeling like it was two hours one has lost to eternity.I'm not against comedians showing off their full range and doing drama. Robin Williams, Jim Carey, and Billy Crystal have shown us their dramatic, dark, and zany sides too. However, generally the dramas that these guys were/are in, are marketed as such; hence no bait and switch.Overall, the movie is probably really a five out of ten, but I really feel bamboozled because of the usage of two great comedic minds to convey this dramatic fluff, so I rate it lower. Ultimately this movie feels too close to real life to function as entertainment. Perhaps the film makers were going more for inspiration? Definitely a movie for drama fans, but not for those comedy fans expecting something like the 40 Year-old Virgin or Good Luck Chuck.",Dan in Real Life
91,LeroyBrown-2,Sweet romantic dramedy but nothing special,6,8 February 2009,"I heard a lot of good things about ""Dan In Real Life"", good things not great things. There's a good reason why they are good things not great things and that's because it is a sweet romantic movie but nothing special. Anybody who has seen the TV ads pretty much know what happens, Dan Burns (Steve Carell) meet a pretty lady named Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and later on meets her again at a family gathering as his brother's girlfriend. They didn't just meet they share a large muffin together and talk. This is where American romantic movies fail, for the most part the conversation just flash through, a couple of complete anecdotes lasting a couple of minutes would make the conversation better. Unfortunately the art of conversation has pretty much died in the movies. At the gathering we meet Dan's family, well sort of we really don't get to meet them individually and they could be interchangeable for all I care. None of them had a distinctive personality except for Mitch, Marie's boyfriend. The scenes with Dan and Marie sneaking trying to talk to each other are sweet but not really amusing, even the bathroom scene. The only time it became mildly amusing was when Dan has a blind date and Marie gets jealous.Juliette Binoche is very lovely and played her scenes well, she's seems to be very adept at these kind of movies. Steve Carell on the other hand seems too much of a sad sack which really brings the movie down. There's a scene when he took some of the kids out and what could have been a good source of laughter just didn't work. Mostly Mr. Carell tended to be too low keyed on those scenes. Mr. Carell's low keyed stone faced sad sack performance in ""Get Smart"" is my main complaint about that movie. He needs to bring out that jerk from ""The Office"" once in a while. The main problem I had with this movie was that it was a little too low keyed. There's nothing wrong with the pacing, the pacing was right but the movie was too subdued specially the acting. For a comedy this movie really just doesn't have as much energy as it should. There were some pretty good laughs but they tend to be sandwich in scenes that feel so morose. Even the look and the soundtrack of the movie feels morose. I think this movie could have been better had they lighten the mood up or made it as a straight drama, because as it is it just didn't work as well as it should.Overall this movie could have been much better had the director, Peter Hedges lighten the mood up and Steve Carell didn't play the sad sack again.",Dan in Real Life
92,mloessel,The movie had moments but they were fleeting,3,18 June 2020,Suddenly the truth is revealed. The happiness that everyone was feeling suddenly takes a nose dive. A relatively flat movie with Dane Cook attempting to carry it but what I saw in Cook's Employee of the Month was non existent in this one. Yawn!,Dan in Real Life
93,c_p_c,"A refreshing, well-done family comedy",7,28 October 2007,"In an age where more and more family members don't speak and relationships are continually strained, ""Dan in Real Life"" appears as an oasis out in the desert.Nowadays, Hollywood seems infatuated with displaying families that have unhappiness at their core. Families who bite at each other, where adults set little boundaries for children and mom and dad do nothing but break each other down. It is typically only in 'kids' movies' where a strong family dynamic is presented. For those of us who don't see too many of those; however, the Hollywood rendition of the American family is rather defeating.Dan's (Carell) family is not the typical Hollywood clan. They are a group of decidedly normal people who all have a love and appreciation for each other. They spend time doing crossword puzzle competitions and having family talent shows. The activities they do are silly, but the group enjoys each minute together.They are also very accepting and inviting of Annie (Binoche), their youngest son's (Cook) new girlfriend. They also get excited when widower Dan shares that he, earlier in the morning, met a woman, Marie, with whom a shared a connection. Turns out Dan's woman and his brother's girlfriend are one-in-the-same. Thus presents the driving action of DIRL, as Dan and Ann-Marie work through the apparent problem amidst the family gathering.DIRL is charming. It doesn't try to be anything else but a feel good romantic comedy infused with some important lessons and values. Carell is the perfect choice for the role of Dan. He is endearing and his average Joe persona works well here. Binoche, beautiful as ever, is both eloquent and energetic. Cook, who seemed an odd casting choice, creates a likable and loyal brother character, making it more difficult for Dan to sweep Marie away from him. Other family members, who receive less screen time, mix well together and create this contagious family environment. In a much smaller role, Emily Blunt delivers a quirky performance as a childhood friend, now grown up, and single.DIRL isn't profound, but its optimism is contagious. Unlike other family-centered comedies that have come out over the past few years (The Family Stone & Meet the Fockers to name a few) DIRL doesn't wade in political agenda or filthy humor. It's a smart, well-written comedy that 's got lots of laughs and a lot of heart. Hopefully, we'll see more films like this.",Dan in Real Life
94,nuhc,Dry & uninteresting,3,18 March 2008,"I can always tell whether or not I like a movie by how riveted I am to it. This is one example of where I kept finding myself being disinterested & my mind wandering. I don't know if this movie intended to be funny or not, but if it was supposed to be, it was even drier than ""The Office,"" in which I enjoy watching Steve Carrell. But the story just seemed to sit there, and watching this movie I felt like I was trapped in a stranger's house for a weekend but couldn't leave due to politeness. I basically couldn't wait for it to end and didn't really care how it ended. The characters may have been developed, but I guess it was just the story line that failed to interest me.",Dan in Real Life
95,mrtimlarabee,Cute and clean...and Dane Cook is actually bearable,7,4 February 2008,"OK movies can be held together by a gifted cast. Dan in Real Life is a pitch perfect example. The plot is fairly familiar territory. A widowed father of 3 kids visits his family and falls in love with a girl he finds is dating his brother. Throughout the film, we're treated to the antics of the family who endure some of the title character's odd behaviors.The success of the film lies in Carrel's performance and the subdued direction of Peter Hedges. A visit to the family can go wacky wrong in pictures like this and you end up with another rendition of Meet the Parents or the like. But while Hedges likes family quirks, he downplays them and keeps our focus on the central characters, and here that is Dan and his love interest, Marie.Carrel plays innocent well. It's hard to imagine another actor playing Dan as likable as Carrel does. That charm is important for the character as even though he irks his family in the film, he remains pitiable throughout. Pitiable is a characteristic many of his characters have, even when they should be deplorable (see ""The Office"").The script is subtle. While this is involves Dan and Marie's relationship, their aren't any of those obvious moments you expect out of films like this, even when the outcome becomes clear. This makes the character of Dan and his situation more convincing. It creates and uneasy kind of humor. We laugh and cringe as we imagine what Dan goes through to try and avoid the inevitable.This is also a good ""family"" film, in that it stresses the importance of family, and that for the most part, it's pretty clean. Dan has three daughters that he takes care of on his own, and he is somewhat overprotective, but is generally a good father. The film shows their relationship with their father and where they don't always see eye to eye. If I have one gripe about the film, it's that the resolution isn't fleshed out more, when the ongoing theme of the film seems to be family.Overall, this is a good natured dramedy that probably doesn't stand out too much within the genre. I liked the fact that this was an adult dramatic comedy that isn't filled with a deluge of toilet humor, though I wouldn't take the little ones.",Dan in Real Life
96,I_saw_it_happen,Nothing Real About It,2,9 June 2008,"This movie was so formulaic that any supposed charm it could have is realized as saccharin before it's even happened. Steve Carrell has proved that he can portray serious roles, comedic roles, and somber roles to a convincing effect, and while there are admittedly a few mildly funny moments in this film, they hardly make the whole film worth viewing. Furthermore, the only reason these aforementioned scenes are funny is that they show 'Dan' (Carrell's character) predictably stepping out of his 'moral authority' role repeatedly, which undercuts the idea of his having any moral authority by the middle of the film. But this is a plot device that, while overused in this film, is at least forgivable given the basic conflict of the film. What is not forgivable is the utter abandoning of reality which constitutes the bulk of the film.Dan's 'family' is one of the most unrealistic portrayals of an American family that I have ever seen on film; Family aerobics? Talent shows? Board games ever few scenes? A collective dismissal of 'Dan' for no obvious reason? Family singalongs about how ugly the girl Dan's mom sets him up on a date with might be? It's simply ridiculous and unbelievable.Dan's daughters are shown as spoiled brats whose pouting and screaming trump his parental role. This builds throughout the film, until a preposterous conclusion in which Dan takes advice on how to pursue romance from his seven year old daughter.There are more flaws, of course, which add the only unpredictable moments as reprieve from the tiresome formula on screen which is 'Dan in Real Life', but to list them would be a task which might take as long as watching the movie. It's totally expendable fluff, not worth seeing. A low for Steve Carrell, who is apparently willing to be poorly typecast.",Dan in Real Life
97,CagedinSanity,"Neat, but flawed.",6,7 August 2008,"I have a soft spot in my heart for ""normal"" movies. Movies that don't try to dazzle you with spectacular acting or overused CGI effects. Movies like this is what entertainment is supposed to me. You sit down for a couple hours to something that you can laugh, maybe cry, and maybe think a little.And this was a ""normal"" movie.For the longest time there was something a little ""off"" about the movie. Did it drag on? Yes. I wasn't expecting the entire movie to take place as the reunion. The trailers didn't insinuate there was a reunion at all. Throws us off. That's a little unfair. But halfway through I accepted that, so, whatever.Secondly, I don't feel enough emphasis was put on Dan as being a writer. It's mentioned briefly a couple times, a couple phone calls. He eventually turns down the huge offer he got because the representatives happened to come around after Dan screwed up with ten people at the same time.I liked the movie, for the most part. But when the ENTIRE family walks in on Dan's romantic kiss (finally), that kind of made me angry. It made me think, ""Well damn. That's a little unfair."" The movie tries to make us relate and like Dan through his hardships, and then he gets kicked in the crotch (Figureatively) during the Bowling kiss scene.I didn't like the daughters. The normal girl and the young girl were fine for the most part, but the movie didn't need to throw in the rebellious brat. They could have done fine by cutting her out and attempting the romance with the other girl, that way her spews about ""love"" would be more romantic and make much more sense from her. Dan's character was correct throughout the entire movie saying ""It's not love, it's teenage lust,"" and yet other adults treat HIM like garbage? Come on. He should have gotten a few pats on the back for good parenting.Overall it WAS a decent movie. The acting is not phenomenal (which isn't a bad thing at all!) and some of the scenes were pretty normalish. I liked that. It's just the dragging on and the couple points mentioned above made it...

101,misterembryo,Dan in Irony,10,27 October 2007,"There is a scene in Dan in Real Life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first. The answer to one of the clues is Murphy's Law: anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. This is exactly the case for Dan Burns (Steve Carell, the Office) a columnist for the local newspaper. Dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life, yet he comes to realize that things aren't so picture perfect in his own. Dan in Real Life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy, tragedy, and beauty of them all. Besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious.The death of his wife forces Dan to raise his three daughters all on his own... each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life: the first one anxious to try out her drivers license, the middle one well into her teenage angst phase, and the youngest one drifting away from early childhood. Things take a turn for Dan when he goes to Rhode Island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a bookstore.Her name is Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolat) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations... which is precisely whats in store when they get thrown into the Burns Family household.If you've seen Steve Carell in The Office or Little Miss Sunshine, you'd know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well. Steve Carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life: the frustration and sincere compassion. The family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax. The movie only falls short in some of the predictable outcomes, yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability: which is an irony within itself.Dan in Real Life is definitely worth seeing, for the sole enjoyment of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life, and I'll most likely enjoy it a second time, or even a third.

There are so many false notes in this film that I'm not sure it's possible to include them all. The cute meeting between Steve and Juliet, the aerobics scene, the shower scene, the interaction between Steve and his obnoxious children, the charades, the talent show, the bowling alley scene at end.blah blah blah.

Accept it for what it is, light entertainment and you will come away satisfied. Carell is very good. Bichette is like a fairy angel. The impromptu singing scene is very funny and human. The story is human in itself. It doesn't need special effects or a narrator to explain. The children steal a few scenes. Just go, see it.

So if you want to watch a comedy like these, you will be failed.I don't blame Steve Carell for my expectation of a great comedy, because he has also played in movies that were not funny or that I have disliked before. But the FUNNY poster of this movie and the good comments about this movie made me believe that I can laugh many times.Don't get me wrong, it is a nice movie.

105,Lemos,Steve Carell's best role,8,24 May 2011,"Saw this recently on free TV, extra nice touch that it was also broadcast as an HD version. Why is this of an potential importance? Well, having read some of the slightly negative reviews, and having on several occasions nearly picked it up for home rental, nothing appeared to convince me that I needed to see it. The truth is I was pleasantly surprised, not by the plot, the luvvy-dovy, hunky-dory cliché family values portrayed on screen, or the role Juliette Binoche (albeit she is always good to watch on screen) reprises once again. None of these. My personal surprise was watching Steve Carell doing a sort of half-serious role, half-comedic role. I thoroughly enjoyed the dark humour dialogue and his portrayal of this character. Because of this, this romantic comedy rises well above many others of the same genre. Well worth watching if not just for the sheer escapism from our own lives.",Dan in Real Life

First of all I would not call this a comedy, it's more of a drama with some funny moments. One thing that bothers me is that I don't sympathize with the main character, I find him selfish, irritating and stupid. On the plus side, I think the movie is well crafted and acted, the story has a lot of heart, even though for me it falls flat when I can't sympathize with Steve Carells character. Juliette Binoche stands out in a low key character role. My rating is 5/10 and unfortunately I must say that I am in a generous mood.",Dan in Real Life

I could simply give this movie a rating of 9 if I want to, but it's simply so good, that I have to offer more.Steve Carrell, our famous guy in Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty and yes! The 40 Year Old Virgin packs and delivers this movie with a blow with his innocent and argumentative look when he gets angry! Oh no, literally! It is that good! Dan lives a hard and demanding life especially after his wife had pass away. She left him with three girls to take care of, one preschool and two teenagers of the extreme age. It is never easy to stay with one single woman in your life and everyone can have a say for that, but Dan lived with three, each with their own personalities, demands and behavior.While taking an annual drop-by visit to the parents', Dan met a wonderful lady, Marie (Juliette Binoche). They spent their initial time together in a bookstore when the latter mistaken him for a bookstore keeper. They reached out for some coffee and Dan mastered most of the conversation, while Marie listened on without intervention. As he rattles on his thoughts and dominantly took up most of the time; Marie never showed any signs of boredom, which triggers Dan that this must be the right next-lady for him to get to know and to further develop feelings for. But time and tide wait for no man, and this wonderful girl Marie had to take her leave, only to be met at the following scene and introduced to Dan as his brother's girlfriend.In many ways, this film reminds me of a lot of truth and life and to top it all, this movie delivers with a commanding wealth of humor and how should I put it?

After all the hype about him, I wanted to like him in 40-Year-Old Virgin (I just couldn't sit through more than 20 minutes of that abysmal film, alas) and in Little Miss Sunshine. I just can't. Maybe if he played something besides unlikeable loser roles, it would be different? Only time will tell, I suppose.Anyway, as repulsed as I was by this movie, it's hard to add anything beyond what insightful posters such as sightgeist310, dcordash,The Sheen, and telboy1999--to name just a few--have already mentioned. I will say that I felt that NONE of the couples in the cast had any chemistry with either other, least of all Carrell and Binoche. They were so chemistry free, it was painful to watch. In fact, the movie seemed like the cast had been given parts and then told to show up with lines memorized to do their scenes on the appointed day. No need to worry about getting to know each other, or run lines with each other, or even develop character ""motivation"" or anything.

Some of the family activities do come across as contrived and hokey but he is more an observer than participant and salvages these scenes. The man has an expressive face and his eyes are soulful. Juliette Binoche does well portraying Marie, a woman of natural beauty,charm, and intelligence. The scenery and the grandparent's Cape Cod style cottage add some flavor to the story. It's not hard to imagine oneself in the scene. The house is not right out of a decorator's magazine. One scene where the family really gets into making fun, in a mean spirited way, is childish. While the group participation is cloying and corny, nevertheless, it wasn't enough to ruin the movie for me. There was a kind of ""odd man out"" about Dan, like his being assigned to the laundry room. You couldn't help but root for him. This is Steve Carell's movie.

The first time I watched it, I loved it; the second time I loved it the same. But why do I find this little movie so enjoyable? First of all, the casting of Steve Carell as the protagonist Dan Burns. I've always liked Carell as an actor and not just as a funny guy. Little Miss Sunshine reassured that. He fits the character like a glove, giving Dan the right amount of humor and emotion which is what makes the character so charming and relatable.Juliette Binoche plays Marie, the love interest of Dan. Binoche is a terrific actress and seems naturally charming playing a role that I find downright lovable. The chemistry between Carell and her only adds to the enjoyment.Dane Cook was not a strong point and he wasn't essential in making the character of Dan's brother what it is. That being said, he was decent and I have no strong complaints about the acting.So, overall, I think ""charming"" is the word I'd use to describe this movie.

If a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes it's probably not going to ever get better. I have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory. Dan in Real Life is definitely no exception. I was watching this turkey and thought; wow, this is not funny, not touching, not sad, and I don't like any of the characters at all.The story of an advice columnist/widower raising three young daughters, who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend. I suppose the tagline would be ""advice columnist who could USE advice""? I don't know. Dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice. I guess THAT'S the irony? I don't know. He goes to see his parents, brothers, sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat, which seems very sweet, and potential fodder for good comedy, story lines...none which ever emerge. The central story is basically how he loves this woman, but can't have her.

114,katzinoire,"Realistic, And Yet Un-Realistic",8,20 October 2008,"Okay, I will admit-I liked the film-a lot. However there was this underlying discomfort over the fact that Marie and Dan were pretty much flirting in front of his brother-who they only take a few moments to show how quickly he has a re-bound rate (after realizing Marie and he are totally quits he takes off with this chick he was making fun of the first part of the movie who grew up to be a hottie). Had they showed more of what a cad Mitch was, I would have felt more like cheering on Marie and Dan.The middle daughter who is angsting it all up was annoying, the older daughter was funny in her attempts in getting to drive, only to ultimately get the job when her father gets his license taken away after one to many tickets in one weekend. The youngest daughter was adorable, I probably connected most with her since my youngest also lost a parent at a very young age and you can see Lily trying so hard to remember her mom, I could feel for her there, because I see my youngest grasping at memories of her daddy all the time.Discomfort aside, I loved, loved, loved the family get together. My guess it was like for Columbus Day weekend or something, but they were damn cute. For the record for the naysayers- 1. I don't work for the movie, nor am I affiliated with it in any other way other than watching it for free on my On Demand and 2. Yes, I know families who have competitions to decide who does the dishes, it isn't as long as a crossword, but it isn't as unrealistic as you think.I could relate to Dan in many ways, being a Widow myself, I could understand the feeling of being left behind with 3 children and how all consuming it gets. The moment when the family is bewildered at Dan picking up a guitar-something he apparently hasn't done since his wife died-was something I understood-in my case it was a camera, but I could understand it. It showed Dan being ready to move on, of course the unfortunate circumstances being that he wanted to move on with his brother's girlfriend. I did get the concept that Marie and Mitch hadn't slept together-aside from the separate room thing, she explained she had just left a messy relationship and hopped into this one. If they did sleep together, I missed that conversation.So on the level of a Widow/Widower moving on-it was dead on. As far as how a large family would react to a sibling even considering being with his siblings girl being acceptable-not so believable.Very watchable, very poignant moments.",Dan in Real Life

This movie has a familiar plot line but with a cast that simply made it fascinating. It focuses on the beauty of love, warmth of families, then moves on to extremely locked on, complex situations, all weaved in a thread of light comedy, great acting and deeply meaningful moments of life and focusing on what really matters in life.
I just gave it 9/10 because the 10/10 movie hasn't been created yet!!",Dan in Real Life
117,schmidteren,It could be Dan in real life,9,9 March 2008,"This is my review of Dan in real life which i've just seen.The movie was in my eyes very realistic, and I think that is a big plus. I can't recollect that I've seen a movie where I felt that what I saw was real like I did with this movie. The acting was great, Steve Carrol gives the character so much, the awkwardness that he brings to the person in some of the scenes are just great, you feel like it was happening to you, and it probably could, and we are all familiar with the situations which are seen in this movie.The movie also had some great Hilarious moments. The movie was not made to be all fun, it had a good script, a nice well written story, where you at no time where confused about anything. The plot was straight out, and there was no time you where like oh my god what is happening now. In my opinion was the movie excellent :D:) And I loved the last scene, where he finish it with the best quote, and a really helpful one, which I would try thinking of from time to time in my life, a very good advice. And I think that that the movie had a nice message to send out to everyone, and it did it in a very good and well done way. Last words. I think that especially the connection between Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche was just fantastic. The emotions between them where very realistic and sweet. I rate this movie 9 out of 10, VERY close to a 10:) (:Edit: I bumped it up to 10 after rewatching several times. It's a movie I really like coming back to, so I think it deserves a 10.",Dan in Real Life
118,love2geek,Predicable.,2,24 May 2021,"This film was disappointing, predicable and boring. I love Steve Carell and was hoping this would be similar to Little Miss Sunshine but alas, it doesn't even come close to having the same charm or warmth as that film. I felt the actors were totally miscast! Dane Cook is ok but really? Why on earth was he in this film? The pair up of his character and Juliette Binoche were completely unbelievably. The family itself made me feel quite anxious and the activities they partook in quite frankly were over the top and cringe inducing. Id be mortified if my family made me do any of those things! Especially the talent show! Good grief. The two older daughters of Steve Carell's character were rude, obnoxious and in my opinion spoilt. Totally unlikeable! I don't think it's good acting or writing to be horrible and dispresctful of your parents? Apparantly the actors spent time together bonding in that house before filming? I never believed it or felt it whilst watching this tired and predicable nonsense. I only watched it all the through as I foolishly rented it on Prime. I smiled meekly at one point when Steve Carell took the younger kids out and they didn't have a good time but that was it, the rest was just super boring! My advise, watch Little Miss Sunshine instead, better film, actors and storyline.",Dan in Real Life

A small interesting story.. one brother unknowingly falling in love with the girlfriend of another brother.. the brothers are attached to each other.. The girl in question is initially confused..AND SHE IS JULIETTE BINOCHE AS MARIE..THE BREATHTAKING ANNA BARTON IN ""DAMAGE"" (1992)WHO COULD SEDUCE DR SEPHEN FLEMING SIMPLY WITH THE LOOK IN HER EYEs..IT WAS UNFORGETTABLE HERE SHE IS MORE MATURE AND SPONTANEOUS.. BUT EQUALLY GORGEOUS ..One must watch the scene when all the family members are playing in the ground and Dan is trying to flirt with Marie ,under the misconception that nobody is noticing ..The response and small gestures of Marie are so natural..Romantic feelings of Dan for Marie, his affection for his brother and his love and protective attitude for his growing daughters are filmed with good effect..Not an outstanding movie.. ,but now a days we do not come across many cute little clean movies ..",Dan in Real Life
120,durf,The worst movie EVER,1,21 June 2008,"I have seen a lot of movies in my life, and I can say without reservation that ""Dan In Real Life"" is the worst movie I've ever seen.I love romantic comedies, but ""Dan"" is neither romantic nor funny. There are no gags written into the script; laughs are supposed to come because of the foibles of the characters. The problem is that to laugh at someone's foibles, you need to feel some empathy for them, and the main characters in ""Dan"" are entirely unlikable.Marie (Juliette Binoche) has ""fallen in love"" with two men in three days, and she doesn't seem to care which one she ends up with or whom she hurts. But she is charming compared to Dan (Steve Carell).When Dan and Marie first meet they go for coffee, and Dan takes the opportunity to spend an hour talking animatedly about himself. Marie is unable to get in a word. Maybe that was supposed to be funny, but I know quite a few people like that, and they are generally neither funny nor particularly likable.Dan certainly doesn't improve. Time after time he demonstrates that he is immature and self-centered. Twice he drives through stop signs without even slowing down. Maybe that's supposed to be funny, too, but a lot of people have died because of that kind of driving. Later Dan jumps in his car in a fog of emotion and backs the car into a police vehicle. Another laugh riot. At least he didn't back over a child.At the end of the film, Dan has some parenting responsibility, but, true to form, he can't stop thinking about himself long enough to take care of it. Instead, his children have to take care of him.The only enjoyment I got out of the entire movie was seeing that Dan and Marie were eventually married. It was delightful to imagine the misery they would surely be causing each other when the infatuation wears off.",Dan in Real Life

For example: that all these people are related; that they get together harmoniously for the holidays; that the parents maintain this enormous house; that all family members, even the teenagers, are happy to act in charades, play touch football and participate in early-morning aerobics; etc etc. This is someone's idea of the typical American family? No teenagers were oppositional or even had acne. Everyone was heterosexual. A presumed adult, Dan allowed himself to be punished by his parents. And I am sick of movies about saintly widowed parents with adorable kids -- once in a while, you see ""The Squid and the Whale,"" but not often, and, in my experience, that's what fractured families look like. I watched ""Dan in Real Life"" when it free on cable because Steve Carrell is great in ""The Office"" (which presents a far more realistic environment than does this movie).Carrell was funny, as usual.

I am typically cynical and sarcastic, and not one for empty sentimentality, so rest assured I don't just love romcoms or chic flicks. I do appreciate a movie that develops character even more than plot, and offers up people that I can care about in some real way. I soooooooo appreciated how much of all of that this movie did offer.These are all people who loved and cared about each other, and showed it in all their very real interactions. I loved the way the story unfolded, and I particularly liked that it got me thinking about my priorities in a similar situation: loyalty to my sibling, surrender to true love, needing to be a good parent?

125,akp0583,Not an laugh out loud film!,7,13 October 2012,"Dan in Real Life (2007)Starring: Steve Carell, Juliette Binoche, Dane CookSynopsis: Dan (Steve Carell) a professional self-help columnist and single dad of three daughters, during their yearly summer vacation at the family home and all the family come together. On the first day there Dan's mother tells him to spend some time alone. That morning Dan meets an interesting woman in a small bookshop instantly there's a mutual attraction, only to find out she recently begun a new relationship with someone. Later that afternoon as he seeks advice from his family whether he should pursue a relationship with this woman his brother announces his new girlfriend Marie (Juliette Binoche) to the family as it turns out to be the same woman from earlier, now Dan as to spend a week trapped in this situation. Review: (May Contain Spoilers) I watched this film originally with the thought of other of Steve Carell's work but it's not that type of comedy. Dan starts the story juggling personal life and work for the first twenty minutes of the movie as most parents can relate to him, however he soon becomes self-obsessed during the film and I struggled to find a connection with the character after the story line was placed in to position. Dan and Marie talk about telling the events of that morning's meeting to the family, Dan say's that would be a bad idea and now the film has a premise. If this or similar was to ever happen to you do the exact opposite to Dan, although we wouldn't have had a movie.Dan starts struggling with his children, two of them are teenage girls and he still treats them like children, not letting them spend time with boyfriends or learning to drive. During the holiday he seems to ignore his youngest whilst sneaking around to constantly talk to Marie. Marie's character you can relate to her being new to a family who are very close however she is well liked by all, we're left all the time thinking that Dan is the better choice of brother for her. Saying that Dan from the beginning twenty minutes and not the majority of the movie. Dan does change throughout the duration of the film, beginning with trusting the daughters and sitting down with them and talking. Dane Cook, Dan's bother quickly goes from likable to a horrible character as the story progresses, leaving you thinking that the writers didn't really care about the characters after their use was fulfilled. Verdict: This wouldn't be a film I'd rush to see again but it is on Netflix if you were ever wanted something to watch, although not a laugh out loud comedy it has some good humor and the all the cast members give a good performance and have their funny moments. A nice movie for two, you and your partner can sit with a bottle of wine and enjoy. See this if you liked: Definitely maybe, Last Kiss, Garden State and not Netflix's suggestion of the US Office.",Dan in Real Life
126,sirkevinho1,"""Mini-masterpiece""...Yes, it's not an exaggeration.",8,19 June 2008,"I was not expecting much from the film when I first rented it; I thought it was just something to past my time with. After seeing it, I am very pleasantly surprised by how smart it is. To a certain extent, it is a ""min-masterpiece"".Of course, this film will not make anyone's ""Best Films of the Century"" list. Yet, when you watch the film, it demonstrated the basic element of all the best films: ""Show, not tell"". It is apparent from the very first scene, as we see Dan, played by Steve Carell, pet the empty side of the bed and look longingly at it. Then he turns around, sighs, and goes to the home office to read letters asking for help. The camera then shows his column in a newspaper. Without a single explanation by anybody, one knows everything about Dan: he lost his wife, he misses his wife, and he is a self-help columnist for a local newspaper. So much information is shown in less than a minute. That, my friends, is film-making at its finest. Watch out for the director. He will be a good one.Carell and Binoche is one of the smartest pairing in recent memories. Who would have thought this unlikely pairing (a funnyman and one of the most elegant leading ladies) would have such perfect and believable chemistry? I never liked Carell before, but this film shows he is quite a capable actor.Of course, the thing that keeps it from being a ""masterpiece"" is that there is nothing that can be remembered about this film. It is part of pop-culture, a fad. There is no iconic scene or a life-altering message within the film. Although it touches on subjects such as love and parenting, there are no new revelations on these subjects and there are no new lessons to be learned. Instead, this is just a lighthearted fun film, as it pokes fun of the notion that newspaper self-help columnist might not be able to solve his own problems.Thus, even if this film is very smart, from the casting to the directing, and it displays very good film-making skills, it is not a ""masterpiece"" because it lacks something that people will remember this film for.7.5/10",Dan in Real Life

What a nice this, and what a nice that, but most of all, I will say two words to recommend this film.Steve Carell.He really showed a nice, subtle depth that touched me. He was truly commanding as a widower who had dedicated himself maybe a little too much to being a good dad first, at the cost of denying his own needs.Did he act like a petulant ass? Why, yes he did.And you see, that's what was perfect about this film. The actor who played this character made me believe he was FEELING something, and not simply ACTING like he was feeling something, and he conveyed to me perfectly what it was that he was feeling, and what he was feeling was denied.Denied happiness.Denied fulfillment.Denied love.Losing your love is painful beyond belief, and many who do so will never feel something like that again.Beautiful film.I gave it an eight out of ten.",Dan in Real Life

Carell's character Dan, in the corniest fashion, in a library meets this girl, then later he finds out its his brothers girlfriend. The family is having a weekend get together. So they both have a crush, or in love, while acting like they don't know each other.If you are a person that expects a fun movie, this is not for you.

129,imdb-5596,Everything that's bad about Hollywood in one handy dull package,1,26 March 2009,"This is a film with nothing going for it.I picked this up on DVD without knowing anything about it - only that I'd seen Carell in The 40yr Old Virgin (which I'd expected to be really dumb, but was pleasantly surprised) and Little Miss Sunshine (which I thought was excellent). Somewhat perturbed that the only review quoted on the packaging was from Heat magazine, but willing to give it a go.From the word go, all I got was cliché. Tired old stereotypes, predictable plot devices - if you can call them that - a sickly pastiche of the blandest of Hollywood's mediocrity strung together for no apparent reason or gain. Romcom's don't *have* to be bad - they can be great - but this film plumbs the depths of the genre, exploring thoroughly all the reasons why the genre has a bad name. Full of syrupy happy family scenes with no tension or edge, from a world which someone with no creativity wants us all to believe in. I felt like I was being lectured about the wonder of American family life - while in fact the film cast that life as a bland, fake world that filled me with dread (and I don't believe that families anywhere - US or otherwise - live like this).Oddly, the redeeming feature was some of the deleted scenes. The moments spent on building character depth seem all to have been cut - the fundamental flaw here is the silly, shallow characters, and giving them some (any) depth would have helped considerably. No points for cut scenes, though - not from me anyway - so this is firmly a 1-star. Ignore all those gushing reviews on here - find some paint to watch dry instead.",Dan in Real Life

He was raised in the perfect family. So his wife died and he is sad. But perfect guru mom should have brought him through that long before the events of the movie take place.Juliet Binoche is wonderful as always, and Dane Cook is at his shallow best, and I believe the chemistry between Juliet and Steve. What I don't buy is anything else.""The Family Stone"" was a much better movie about essentially the same things, with much more believable relationships.

Judging from audience laughter, it was well enjoyed.I give this film a 7 out of 10 solely based on the fine performance of Steve Carell as Dan, and to a lesser extent Juliette Binoche as Marie. Carell the interplay between them at times is hilarious, but only because we, the audience, know the reality of the situation.The rest of the characters are on the whole unlikable. Two of Dan's three daughters are self-centered manipulators. The middle daughter especially is in need of serious counseling. Dan's brother is a manipulative liar, but that is never addressed. Superficially the family seems warm and supportive, but with a little deeper look you see they are really cruel and judgmental. They are like a 50's sitcom family filtered through John Waters. This comes through clearly in the scene prior to Dan's date.Some here have compared this to Little Miss Sunshine, another superficial family film about a hideously dysfunctional, unlikable family. This was not nearly as depressing.Even after reading my own review, I still give it a 7, but want to emphasize that this film is carried by the two leads.",Dan in Real Life

Hard to imagine anyone watching that scene without feeling the sting of tears behind the eyelids or a lump in the throat.All the family characters are well played and the leads are quite good.

Was it a case of take the money and run? Alarms always go off when I can start anticipating exactly what twists and turns the plot is going to take. Did the scriptwriters really think they were doing anything original? Or was this an exercise in total cynicism as they recycled every lame, tired piece of TV sitcom shtick I'd seen since 1958? Obnoxious, smart-ass kids who know more than dumb old dad, is one example. The cast deserved better material.

Well, the flow of the movie was really smooth in terms of the process that an ordinary beginning slowly turns into a rather fun and well-played development part.However, I have to make a few comments about what the haters of this movie wrote.It is really strange that cliché of happy endings created a cliché of sad endings. Now either your movie is a standard ordinary ""happy ending"" movie that has ""oh my god"" no originality; or you can finish it with big sad bad ending where you would just achieved uniqueness and originality. To be more specific, haters of this movie basically say that they hate the happy ending. I guess they would be more happy if Dan died in an accident and all his kids went blind, deaf or something. Can't a director want a happy ending without being afraid that people would think it is cheesy now?! Anyway, movie was mostly fun, entertaining and well played, especially by Steve Carell.

The problem is that he does this as the result of a stay with his family. I was going to use the term ""family from hell"", but one commentator apparently beat me to it. All great minds think alike.There is a subplot about his attraction to his brother's girlfriend, but I can't say I found myself very involved in it.I have never seen such a bunch of frantic, hyperactive people as this family in my life; I grew fatigued halfway through the film just watching them.

I don't want to watch a movie about people I don't care about. I really liked the whole family atmosphere. I liked the way the family played together and had fun together. It was really nice. His misery on finding out that the woman he just met is with his brother was played nicely. You could just feel how awful that would be. You meet somebody that you think is special, and then suddenly what seemed to be the starting point of a relationship turns into the end of the relationship. It's especially frustrating and unbearable when the more you get to know of the person, the more you like them. The family was so close and the woman was so accepted as the brother's girlfriend that I had to wonder how in the world it would ever be possible for him to end up with the woman, even if she were to decide that she preferred him over the brother. It seemed as if it would just be unthinkable, because the brother and the rest of the family would hate him then. I'll leave it to you to see how it turned out. Incidentally, the given description gives away something at the beginning of the film and I think it should be changed so that it doesn't do that. (If it were to be changed, I'd have to modify my review so as to not give away anything.)

140,wormguy,The Unbearable Flatness of Being in Love in Modern Movies,2,20 April 2008,"I saw the trailer for this film and was intrigued by it however it turns out that all the good moments seem better when the tedium is subtracted. As someone else pointed out the trailer contains a scene that got cut. How often does that happen? Normally I stay away from romantic comedies because unlike a good slasher film which leaves you feeling soiled for an hour or two, a bad romantic comedy can sour you on the state of romance between the sexes forever. Dan in Real Life goes a long way toward that goal. It occurs to me that the filmmakers discovered a plentiful lack of chemistry between the stars and made a command decision to evade the moments when they fall in love by drawing back mercifully to observe Dan working his magic on Marie from a distance. Up close it evaporates pretty quickly. On a cringeworthy scale the bowling scene is off the charts which is the real reason the bowling alley owner turns the lights down. She wanted to spare us the embarrassment. But here's the really sad thing: contemporary writers have no idea what romance is or why anyone would or does fall in love. Sad thing #2: That there's a demographic who finds Dan's character appealing. As someone else pointed out he has the charisma of a stalker and that would be okay if...he was somehow transformed by love but, to me, he never entirely leaves his creepy sexless self behind. What we have here is a failure to communicate...the strange elusive alchemy of desire. In this movie they didn't even bother to try.",Dan in Real Life
141,The Sheen,Something amiss at the IMDb,1,15 November 2007,"-might contain spoilers... but believe me, this movie spoils itself from start to finish.I walked into this movie with high expectations. It was my own fault. I had put too much stock in Steve Carell's record to date. 40 year old virgin... Little Miss Sunshine... The Office. And I also made the mistake of coming to IMDb and seeing a 7.5 user rating before going to the movie. It's always been a very good predictor in the past, but something is definitely off lately. The last time I felt this embarrassed and in this much pain in a movie theater was watching ""Blue Steel"" in 1990.This flick fumbled from start to finish. The script was flunky material. Awful writing all around. ""Murderer of love""? ""Love is an ability""? Whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that struck American Beauty's writer(s)... trying waaaaayyyyyy too hard. The entire flick was peppered with Three's Company'ish moments like the awful and contrived shower scene. Or the pointless/confusing aerobics scene. Or the awful laundry room scene. Right when you think something serious and/or real is about to happen, they toss in one of these terrible moments. And it happens over and over and over again.And what's with Carell's character? The guy meets some lame broad at a book store and is suddenly head over heels in love? Let's face it. Their conversation sucked. They both should have said their goodbye's after a few minutes. Pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune of watching this movie.... Carell's character is trying to say something which is absolutely random and un-funny (I think the exact line was ""this one time when I was a kid""... that's it. seriously), but both are laughing so hard that coffee is about to spout out of their noses. The actors themselves looked like they were in pain, wondering why they're being directed to do what they're doing.Back to the IMDb thing... you guys need to figure out a way to keep a movie's promotional team off this site. I know it's impossible, but it's painfully obvious the first 20 or so ratings/reviews were either posted by 12 year olds, or by flunky's hired by the studio.

This movie is listed as a comedy and there were a couple of times that me and my friends chuckled a little, however it was in no way a comedy.I am sure the daughters rantings were supposed to be funny, but instead teaches you to hate young teenage girls if you hadn't already. The amount of ""Like omg!, thats totally funny"" that came from my movie theatre made me want to off myself. This made me believe that this movie was for preteens and not for adults.Steve Carell's interactions with Juliette Binoche are at first cute in the bookstore, however when he returns to his parents home to find her there its all very painful for the rest of the movie. Marie strings him along for the whole movie which results in him basically betraying his brother. At the end of the movie everything wraps up so nicely so everyone can feel good that it was obviously uninspired and very boring.Every single interaction between Dan and his two oldest daughters are painful, its almost as if they just met. All they do is fight in the least funny way possible. I didn't laugh once when his daughter was crying about how much she loved her boyfriend, was that supposed to be funny? I couldn't wait until those scenes were over.It seems that the point of the movie is that 13y/o girls are right to fall in love in 3 days because thats exactly how the would works, that is true love. And I am sure we are all surrounded by working relationships that started at age 13.One last thing i would like to add is that the family loves Marie so much that when there is a confrontation between brothers they basically stay out of it. Instead of hating Marie they wait to see how this will play out hoping that she will stay in the family somehow.If you are a borderline vegetable and you hate kids you will love this movie. It has everything you want. No humour, a father who forgets about his kids after a day with a woman, and the nice ending where everyone is happy so you don't have to think on your way home.",Dan in Real Life
143,twsegreto,Working Title: Full House The Movie,7,3 December 2007,"The film was very good; a man who lost his wife and now takes on the roles of both the parents for his 3 daughters. Because he is a male they don't connect on many different levels. Ironically he is a writer of family values columns. But one must ask themselves; did I just watch 90 something minuets of the TV show Full House? Given this film was much better then the TV show Full House - it had all the same basic elements and problems. An middle-aged man looking for love and trying to juggle family at the same time. The fathers lack of understanding for adolescent females, and the real bread winner: he was a dork.Yet, there were other aspects of family in the movie that made up for the cliché story. The other family members were excellent and provided great laughs, and no I am not talking about Jesse and Joey.Idea, not so original. Movie, pretty pretty pretty good - yet predicable. A romantic comedy for adults and for teenagers.",Dan in Real Life
144,willis066,"Great Family comedy, enjoyed it more than i thought i was",9,22 April 2008,"When i first got this film i wasn't expecting much im not one for PG comedies not really one for PG movies period (i like to see life as life and i don't see it in a PG movie just me i guess) but this was actually a hilarious movie that didn't need swear words or make fun of people jokes this was a hilarious comedy that makes you laugh at family, love, and the awykward'ness of life i guess you can say. not going to say much but if you want a great family film this is it. there are a lot of laugh out loud scenes in the movie but take a look out for the funniest scene when Steve Carrell and his brother in the movie Dane Cook go out double dateing. hilarious 8.7 out of 10",Dan in Real Life
145,TruthIsOutThere,A Snooze,4,26 October 2007,"This movie had great potential. Steve Carrell is great as a soon-to-be syndicated advice columnist on a journey to find himself, but I found myself falling asleep. The movie is like watching somebody's home movies that were edited together with a love story twist thrown into the mix. Sure the movie has some funny parts, along with some sad moments, but it just doesn't work. Also the soundtrack had some lovely tunes, but I think that it would have worked with some '80s or '90s pop songs, instead of the sappy guy playing a guitar in a high pitched voice. If you're a fan of Steve Carrell's and you're looking for a good comedy, you're better off watching him on The Office.",Dan in Real Life
146,email2amh,This is a poor movie,2,29 October 2007,"I know it's politically correct to like Steve Carell and movies of his ilk, but I actually cringed through portions of this very unfunny comedy. It fails the best test of most movies...are the characters likable? In this film, no. ""Dan"" is whiny, annoying, and though supposedly a sad, low-ego guy, is actually quite conceited. Juliette Binoche has two different (unintended, unexplained) personalities, and comes off to me as a crazy, older chick who will jump for any man. The kids are the highlight of an otherwise drab film - and the only characters with any sense at all (also a major warning signal to filmgoers). Lastly, this is just the latest in a long line of slightly eccentric, totally unrealsitic family gathers for the holidays films, and to that extent, is very unoriginal. Add to that the one-joke plot (soooo common in today's inferior films), and you got nothing much. There were several 15-year-old's in the theater, and they laughed at many of the non-jokes. Not sure what this says about such a film. Avoid this film.",Dan in Real Life
147,LittleMunchkin,An All-Around Film That Included Comedy As Well As Drama,8,14 January 2008,"Dan In Real Life was a delightful comedy that explores many issues surrounding dating, parenting, and family. Each character seems to have its own story that contributes to the overall, but each also adds to the humour.Steve Carell stars as Dan, a columnist similar to Dear Abby in that he gives advice surrounding family issues. His problem is that he doesn't seem to be following his own advice when he puts his own wants in front of his daughters, who he raises on his own. After going to his parents house for a weekend with the family, he meets and falls for his brother's girlfriend. This is where most of the comedy comes into place, as he struggles with his feelings for Marie (Juliette Binoche) and his loyalty towards his brother, Mitch (Dane Cook).His three daughters add a nice bit of usual teenage trouble. The oldest wants to drive, the middle is ""in love"" and the youngest is the cute little girl we all love. Dan's own siblings like to add to Dan's dilemma, as well as his parents.This was not the slapstick comedy I was expecting, but I don't think I would have liked it if that was the case. The ending was predictable, but it was still a cute family comedy that also had its own little drama.",Dan in Real Life
148,selune13,Made me more uncomfortable than sentimental.,4,16 March 2008,"Dan and his daughters travel to his parent's home to meet all their family for a get-together. Right at the beginning of the movie, he meets a woman who he's instantly attracted to, but who turns out to be his brother's girlfriend. Ensuing predictable love story. Juliette Binoche was cast as the love interest, and her acting is okay except her constant loud laughing started to get on my nerves.There is also a side story about Dan's relationship with his daughters. Since he writes a column on parenting, of course he's going to have to learn some sort of lesson with his own children. One daughter wants to drive, one believes she's in love, and the other just wants attention. The daughter who believes she's in love will probably irritate viewers as her lines are so over the top. There are some genuinely funny moments and some great casting, but it's nothing at all like you'd expect from the previews. It's not really a humorous movie, with very few, if any, laugh-out-loud moments. In fact, there are several times where you just feel uncomfortable at Dan's despicable behavior. He's just creepy and mean and you just want to shove him out the door. When his mother refuses to let him participate in a family game, you applaud. The movie could have been so much better if they'd stuck to romantic comedy instead of stalker creepy.Overall, a predictable but watchable movie if you can get over Carrell's creepiness in some parts.",Dan in Real Life
149,flamethrower72,"Not a crack up movie, but it will give you a good laugh.",7,19 November 2007,"I went to the movie theater yesterday. There wasn't really anything good playing. So it was either ""Bee Movie,"" or ""Dan in Real Life."" So I gave this movie a shot. There were about 15 people in my theater. Looking at the trailer, it didn't look to funny. But after the first 15 minutes, I was wrong. First of all, the movie was a little slow paced. It took about 20 minutes to really know what was going on. But after that, the movie took off. With a laugh around every corner, I found myself actually enjoying this movie. I am not saying everybody was cracking up but there were many laughs.So overall, if you are one of those people looking for a crack-up, laugh your guts out movie, this is not for you. But if you are the kind of person looking for a good laugh, this is the movie for you.So overall, I give ""Dan in Real Life"": 7/10.",Dan in Real Life
150,Mysticum,The most thoroughly repulsive main character in modern cinematic history.,2,21 March 2008,"I suppose my vote may be harsh, but I do not consider a movie that constantly makes me cringe with embarrassment and repulsion a good one.Steve Carell's character is an unrestrained ass of the first degree. Almost every scene in the movie has him doing something that makes me shake my head and frown. He repeatedly spits his brother in the face, and forces his entire extended family witness his unfathomably petty behavior, which they handle with admirable restraint. To avoid spoilers, I will not elaborate on the nature of his trespasses against common decency, but they are legion.The only likable character in the movie is Steve Carell's brother (Dane Cook), who is an amazing fellow: decent, loyal, and honest.I realize that my opinion is not aligned with that of the masses, but I thought I'd offer an alternative view of this train wreck of a movie - a movie which is neither funny nor heartwarming.If Steve Carell is supposed to leave a positive impression on the viewer, then there is little hope for humanity.",Dan in Real Life

152,Gandhi2,AHEM! Dan In Real Life - Where do I truly start to express the merits?,9,10 May 2009,"How can you sum up just exactly how feelgood and right and touching this film is?? For several weeks this DVD leaped off the shelf at me every time I went in the store - having seen Steve Carrell in a couple of films previously, I didn't want to smear my thought process of him - so I resisted and resisted, until finally I grabbed it up with a 'What the hell!' attitude! And how surprised was I! I just wish I had purchased it earlier. Having watched it three times in two days I am still smiling at how the portrayal of a widower struggling with three daughters, yearning for that which is missing since the passing of his beloved wife, who thus meets an intriguing woman, charming her in such a profound and interesting (dare I say bookish?) way, throws a whole different light onto life that makes him realize she is what he has been searching for.The snag of that woman being his brothers girl complicates matters - which portray Dan comically shy and with a heartfelt chagrin, seeing his ""someone special"" bringing such fun and enjoyment into the family home as well as his brothers life. You just really begin to feel for him.Then when the blind date occurs with Ruthie Draper - that is the turning point in Marie's estimation of Dan!! The look she gives him when he repeats her comment, about not liking Ruthie - sheer Green-Eyed Monster! Triggering an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the most well-crafted as Dan starts to loosen up with regard to Marie.Other gut-wrenching scenes - Dan returns from the Book and Tackle Shop, confronted by his brothers, begins to describe what has just occurred....when Dan's face drops it brings a sharp intake of breath!!His youngest daughter Lilly making the present celebrating their love for Suzanne, his late wife, brings a little heartfelt warmth and a little gulp as Dan realizes just what he has lost in life.When Dan plays guitar and sings at the Talent Show....his voice cracking slightly as he reprises the song....absolute gem! The acceptance of what occurs late in the film by his daughters...they all three love their father and want to see him happy, will not let him deny his love for Marie; the desperateness of Dan not to fail his daughters because he is their rock, their stronghold...and tell him so much more than that with just a few words.I could go on and on but I will leave it for now - maybe return and add more comments here in the near future....but I will end by saying........if you want to watch a film that is just so damn good, with twists of comedy to lighten up the drama, that never feels forced or crass, that comes over as a genuine portrayal of a man discovering new life - not just with a woman but also with his extended family, then look no further.DAN IN REAL LIFE - 9 out of 10 for such a well-rendered cinematic experience with a score by Sondre Lerche, that intimately takes you there throughout whilst never being intrusive, with fine performances by the ensemble cast.

155,chaps3,Not Real Life,4,8 September 2008,"I did so want and expect to enjoy this movie. Peter Hedge's ""Pieces of April"" was one of the funniest and most profoundly moving films of its year. And this movie had everything going for it. The cast was so talented and attractive. Imagine being so rich in casting that you can use Diane Wiest and John Mahoney as background filler. The house was beautiful. The children were charming. Sadly, almost every moment of this movie felt false, forced and over-choreographed. The humor was rarely organic and the pathos was pushed and unfelt. The shower scene felt like bad TV sitcom and the scene where the whole family does an aerobics class on the lawn was embarrassing. It's really sad because all the ingredients were present for a wonderful, heartfelt picture. This was not it. If you want to watch a movie on similar themes that succeeds where this film fell flat, rent ""The Family Stone."" That movie, which was mistakenly marketed as a screwball comedy contains genuine humor in the love and the hostility that real families have. The laughs and the hurt are earned in that movie.

For me it is one of those hidden gem films that is cult but not a massive hit. its strengths are the study of family dynamics, and its humour care of a good script and a host of good actors. it is a film that as a family we can watch again on a cold winters night and still laugh at. if you like films with an emotional heart, that has a meaningful psychological story line and a nice love story then i am sure you will like this story, for me it must score a minimum of 7.5. The actors in the film read like a whose who, and when you look at the actors talking about the film there seems to be a lot of preparation which shows through in the film.",Dan in Real Life
157,efrain911,Dan in Real Life is Simply Awesome. Steve Carrell is sweetly normal. Juliette Binoche is perfect.,10,24 October 2007,"I loved ""Dan in Real Life"". A wonderful journey-to-love story like You've Got Mail or While You Were Sleeping, but not ridiculously full of sight gags and crude jokes, and not so romantic it makes you wanna throw up. Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular advice columnist who can't seem to get things in his own life straightened out. Until one day, on a family gathering/trip, he meets and instantly connects with Marie (the always beautiful Juliette Binoche)a radiant specimen of a woman who seems to be framed in a hazy filter hearkening back to the starlets of classic cinema. Chemistry happens over a cup of tea and muffin, but Marie must be off for a previous engagement, and they must part ways. Later we are treated to Dan's tight-knit, fun-loving relatives who not only have big breakfasts together but also enjoy using the intelligent and sweetly dorky Dan as the butt of many bachelor jokes. What I liked so much was that although the family's characteristics could be seen as obnoxious to some, I thought it was a great portrayal of a big family that doesn't venture into parody or crude exaggeration. The Burns family is simply a close, loving group of people who are truly interested in the best for Dan. There are wonderfully awkward family moments that aren't unrealistic. The family is nosey, but never mean-spirited or gossipy; quirky, but never outlandish.And then Dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend he's brought to the family gathering. And thus begins a roller-coaster of restrained longing and funny love-budding. I could go on but I just thought this movie was simply awesome. It's not particularly ""hip"" or ""clever"", never too wordy and obsessed with dry humor or biting wit as many comedies are in modern cinema. There is a nice balance of storytelling visuals and funny-but-real dialogue. in fact, early in the movie, the initial spark of love begins with whimsical discussion in a classic Hollywood-style conversation where the characters say what they're thinking out loud.So I've probably rambled and repeated myself, but I highly recommend ""Dan in Real Life"". It's a great date movie, trust me, you'll laugh, and only if you're a geek like me you'll get a bit teary-eyed. Filled with fun and magical love, ""Dan in Real Life"" won't disappoint.=================== 3.5 out of 4 stars Grade: A",Dan in Real Life
158,Harry_Keane,A surprisingly entertaining and amusing film,8,24 January 2008,"My wife and I ""accidentally"" saw this film - we arrived at the cinema too late to see our first choice and decided we would rather not go home again; we elected to see whichever film was about to start. I didn't expect much of the film, having read a synopsis on the Cineworld website, but we were very pleasantly surprised. I thought the casting was great, especially with John Mahoney as the patriarch of the family. The plot wasn't terribly sophisticated or complex, but it was all the better for being uncomplicated. The whole film was full of feel-good factors, the principal one I suppose being the whole idea of the great big family get-together with all the kids playing happily and learning new things from each other and the adults - it was charming and made me wish I'd been able to enjoy such gatherings when I was a child. Despite its simplicity and the fact that we could guess the end from about 20 minutes in, we thoroughly enjoyed it and left feeling that we'd been ""entertained"".",Dan in Real Life
159,paulefortini,"Good, Not Great",7,21 November 2007,"The only thing I really didn't like about this movie was that it was good when it could have been great. Enough has been said about the plot, but to sum it up, it involves a widowed dad played by Steve Carrell who is an advice columnist. He has three daughters. While away for a family reunion, he meets a wonderful woman at a bookstore not knowing that she is his brother's (Dane Cook) girlfriend. You can take it from there.As a previous poster states, this movie goes for intelligence instead of ""dumb-guy"" humor. It seems to like its characters. Dianne Wiest and John Mahoney are terrific as his somewhat meddlesome parents (particularly Wiest). I don't like Dane Cook much, but even he turns in a decent performance. I also liked how the family, while quirky, does love one another. Another nice touch is how Dan has to sleep in the laundry room.Unfortunately, I also wanted to slap Dan about half-way through the film. See, in real life, had such an encounter occurred, we would have the awkwardness between the guy and girl (that's a given). But they would have gotten over it, or at least kept it to themselves. Dan is so obsessed with her that it was getting on my nerves at times and he is willing to risk his relationship with his brother (I can't really relate to that as I have two sisters and no brothers. But I still wouldn't do anything to risk my relationship with them). But then again, we wouldn't have a movie if Dan wasn't so obsessed.Despite the above, it's still a worthwhile to see this movie. It is refreshing to see a movie for adults with this level of maturity.",Dan in Real Life

To make his mom start the washer at the same time, washing shoes, by the sound of it... Not funny. And the whole scene with the morning exercise? Please... That may be funny on Americas funniest home videos, but to make this out as a humorous highlight in a comedy like this!? It completely falls through.To me, the only good thing about this movie, was to hear that the music of Sondre Lerche as a soundtrack, which I thought worked very well.",Dan in Real Life

The trailer was OK...the storyline was borderline OK (done a zillion times)...and lets face it, looked like the target audience was anyone over the age of 30 (no offense to anyone over 30).That being said, I couldn't have been MORE wrong about my pre-conceived feelings. This was absolutely one of the best films I've seen all year. It is laugh-out-loud funny, it has some very real and tender moments and Steve Carell's performance is just brilliant.Anyone, and I do mean anyone, who sees this film will leave with the feeling that they just saw a diamond in the rough. I honestly wish that more people would go out and experience it. I was truly blown away. The writing, directing and acting were all phenomenal.

Dans love interest, Marie, would rather have two brothers wrapped around her little finger than be a tad bit decent and clear the whole mess up and stick with one. The real clincher was when she was actually ANNOYED when Dan was with someone else, and then took it out on him the next day like he owed her something. The ending was predictable however much i prayed that it wouldn't be so.

Well I discovered that today when I went to see this supposedly romantic comedy and ended up feeling so sorry for the adult cast and crew in their attempt to make a reasonably good movie surrounded by all those screaming kids.Please don't let my opinions stop you from going to see this mundane and typically modern American comedy.The film seemed to portray ordinary-everyday, hard-working, down-to-earth, happy, real people with lots of screaming, blonde, predominantly female children who are always playing family games, eating, and dressed so badly that I really have to question the wardrobe and make-up budget! The wedding was the only well-costumed scene in the entire movie.Steve Carell is brilliant playing totally over-the top comedic characters, but in this heart-warming, family movie, he is just wasted and miscast.Juliette Binoche, a stunningly attractive and accomplished French actress, playing an American with a dubious accent? Diane Wiest - whatever happened to Diane's interesting roles she is famous for? She is now regularly cast as frumpy grandmothers with bad hairstyles.John Mahoney reminded me I was not watching ""Fraser"" any more, although he was dressed as his previous character as well.I enjoyed the performance of Emily Blunt as Ruthie 'Pig-Face' Draper - she looked great, was costumed well and played a 'realistic' character who also danced well.My favourite scene was when Marie had to pretend to take a shower while Dan was hiding behind the shower-curtain - the expression on Juliette Binoche's face is priceless.All up, I enjoyed a few laughs and the very good cinematography, but can't say I was impressed with the movie - but as I say, don't let my review stop you from viewing this movie yourself - you may think it's wonderful!",Dan in Real Life

But beyond that section of the movie the section, or really area, that threw me off was Carell. Normally when I seen a movie that has Steve in it I always consider whether or not to rent or not. When I saw the previews I thought I saw a funny Steve Carell comedy. I was mistaken. Maybe one or three parts made me laugh. The rest made me become restless and angry for such a deceiving commercial that only show the one to three funny parts and then blah. So anywhere let me see if I can find a positive positive here ah some of the quotes were actually worth remembering.

165,tinygreenmunkey,Is love an ability?,7,3 October 2010,"I rented this for Emily Blunt :) and even though her screen time is tiny, it was satisfyingly funny as heck! I'm not a father or a widower, but I have lost one of my parents and I have taken care of my niece and nephew, so I feel I can be a lil judgmental in my review. I will get the most bothersome part out first.Dealing with the death of a spouse must be difficult, I cannot imagine how Dan managed to move on and from what it appears- has managed to provide a healthy, meaningful life to his three daughters and still have the energy to smile and make individual sandwiches. Dealing with the death of their mother must have been equally hard for the daughters, especially the elder ones, which I guess is the reason why I was prepared to be forgiving in the beginning of the movie when the middle child is shown to be exceptionally vile to her father.OK. You are 15 yrs old and you believe you are in ""love"" and proceed to act like a crazed lunatic, lying, blubbering and screeching painfully at every opportunity your father tries to talk some sense into you. Your dad is at least above 40, has been through a marriage, childbirths, career- by all rights he would be having some frame of reference to base his decisions on? Cara, I'm really sorry to say, is an ungrateful, spoilt, ill-tempered (even for a 15 yr old!!), rude and a down-right vile child. I know I said vile before. There is no other way to describe her treatment of her father. I felt no sympathy for her and it was incredibly wrong of the movie-makers to have the final scene, where her poor father apologizes to her (the others, I can understand). He shouldn't ever have to apologize for looking out for his daughter when admittedly at 15 we are known to make really stupid decisions! Apart from Cara, I loved Dan- such a delightful man. Funny and sweet and so endearingly unsure, wanting to be loved and show love and just have that acceptance again in his life. Wanting to do the right thing but bungling it up colossally cause he's a man- flawed and in love. I felt he could have perhaps eased up with his eldest on her driving the car. If he could perhaps have shown more confidence in her. The youngest was just plain adorable and so wise! Loved her character.I loved the dynamic between Dan and Marie, I think it was extremely well showcased- wanting to be together yet forcing yourself not to be yet going ahead and throwing yourselves at each other in tiny lil moments, knowing its wrong, wanting it to be right, hoping no one notices... ahhh! sweet love! I have read views here that think Binoche wasn't the right choice, but I think it worked beautifully. Her accent, her slightly bohemian personality worked wonderfully against Carells.The Burns Family, although a tad annoying (noisy laundry at night, barging in on private conversations) are close-knit (perhaps too much?) We get it... the film-makers wanted to portray an over-the-top but still lovable smattering of people that we all have in our own families.My favorite scene is the one where they double date and Dan attempts to ""dance"", cracks me up every time! My second favorite scene is the bookstore scene, it was played out so naturally.I enjoyed this one a lot!",Dan in Real Life

The only thing that saved it was steve carell's acting, which is effortless even in bad writing, and Julianne Binoche's beauty, and I am not even attracted to women.there are some seriously unbelievable things that go on in this movie. When the family is together, I feel trapped during the movie. I hate his family, they are all fake, and I hate Dane Cook. When they do things, they all have to do it together. What family works out in their front yard all together in their yoga pants and sweats? IS there a family somewhere in the country that does that/ BEcause I never want to meet them. Why would a seventeen year old girl barge in on her uncle's girlfriend when she is taking a shower? And why wouldn't the girlfriend just say, Um, LEAVE!!! instead of stripping down in front of your secretive accidental love connection that so happens to be in the shower. This whole movie keeps you wondering, and not in a good way.And they all play football, while EVERYONE is doing something. It is so cheesy. The little kids are cheering, the adults are tackling each other and laughing it up like these are the only friends they ever had.I HATE THEM All!! I didn't like Dan, I didn't like Marie, I hated his kids, there is no draw to any of them.Yet there are moments that are so unrealistic, it's like a fantasy.

168,seth_harg,too much sweet brings cavity...,5,9 May 2008,"I'm a big fan of moody, somber movies focusing on the life of a single, depressed person trying to figure things out when answers are way in front of him/her. That's why I was hoping to catch the mood in this movie... what I caught was plainly, annoyance...I really loved Pieces of April. Especially cause it stars Katie Holmes before Tom Cruise violated her. This movie just didn't work for me. It's just too sugar coated. Everything seems forced, the dialog was just painful to hear, and is the family even logical??? or is it more because I've spent the majority of my life way back east away from families like those? Put it together Steve Carrell! Oh yeah... such a stupid waste of Emily Blunt!!!",Dan in Real Life
169,sro28-1,An Absolute Embarrassment,1,27 May 2008,"There's an early comment from The Sheen on 11/15/07 regarding the need for IMDb to figure out a way to keep a movie's promo team off the site. I couldn't agree more. That HAS to be what's going on here with all the positive comments. Don't believe me? Watch the movie.I have to believe that had someone  anyone  on the set during filming stepped back and asked, ""Is there any realism in what we're filming here? Do families really interact with each other this way?"", production would have immediately shut down. It is a complete embarrassment for everyone involved. The only positive takeaway from this movie is for struggling screenwriters: don't give up hope! If a script this bad can get made into a film with quality actors agreeing to take on the project, there's hope for whatever you're writing.",Dan in Real Life
170,bole79,Real Surprise,6,9 April 2009,"I've never seen a bad movie with Juliette Binoche, so I guess she isn't a paycheck actress, but is a wise picker. But I'd been worried this would be the first bad one for obvious reasons, being an American film, a somewhat screwball romantic comedy, costarring Steve Carell.Don't get me wrong, I think Steve Carell is a fine actor and I hope he will get more good roles and perfect them as this one, but some of his films doesn't mean anything to me, like Evan Almighty and Get Smart.Anyway, it wasn't a bad movie! It isn't and I was really pleased. This has to be the best performance by Steve Carell I've seen. If I met him and was asked I would salute him. It is obviously still an American film, but a surprisingly good one.I would really like to buy myself a DVD now to have the film close to me and watch it again sometime, even sometime sometimes. All the scenes seems well done and manytime enjoyable except for the end credits ending which could be somehow different, I don't really know, but does it have to show the wedding like zillion other films show? Perhaps something from the time Marie spent with Dan and her daughters prior to the wedding instead, like how were they forming as a family?",Dan in Real Life
171,iamthejoey,Steve Carrell in Real Life,7,30 November 2007,"This movie was good. Not amazing. But good. With a bit of a Family Stone feel (except w/o quite so many dysfunctional family moments), Steve Carrell proved once again that he is NOT only over-the-top boss Michael Scott of NBC's The Office, but that he is an actor, and a good one at that. Playing a widowed ""good father, but sometimes a bad dad"" (compliments of his 11 year old daughter), Carrell helps you like him, feel his pain and love, and want things to turn out alright for him in the end. There is nothing overly special in this movie (besides maybe Dane Cook playing Carrell's brother WELL), but it will grab your attention and your heart. Carrell isn't the overly pitiable character that makes you want to throw up; he is real, and thats why we like him. Go see this movie, enjoy it, and then watch it again. You'll want to.",Dan in Real Life
172,rancher0000,Forty year old turd,1,28 October 2007,"This is one of the worst films I have seen this year. Who wrote this stinker? Apparently someone from a very dysfunctional family with a retarded sense of humor. The lameness and just simple stupidity of what this film asks you to accept is beyond comprehension. Family aerobics??? Rude and disrespectful children that insult and demean their widowed father?? The shower scene?? Dane Cook playing another ""shallow Hal""?? Are all these actors so bad with loser careers this is the only way they can get a pay check?? The film was like a bad bowl movement that you think is never going to end. When you are finished you thank God and hope you never have that experience again. Steve, watching your movie was like making a forty year old turd. Painful. It was much like the experience in ""Clockwork Orange"" to try and stay seated to get my discounted ticket money's worth. If you like torture and looking at people for two hours that act like they hate each other then have a go at this crap.",Dan in Real Life
173,ammar-lilamwala,an amazing movie.,9,8 September 2010,There are not many movies out there that are such a pleasure to watch. I recently became a big fan of Juliette Binoche and was browsing the movies she's been in. Thats when I stumbled upon Dan in Real life. The last time I saw a trailer for this movie I thought it was a dark and slow movie that will get me depressed. Believe me when I say this but it was completely the opposite. Dan is a single Dad who is taking his three daughters to the yearly family meet somewhere in Rhode Island. There are a lot of laugh out loud moments through out the movie. The lesser you know about the plot before watching this movie the better.Amazing performances all around. Very well done. This movie was an absolute joy to watch and I reckon I'm going to watch this movie a couple more times.,Dan in Real Life
174,bitten_by_kittens,Most annoying film ever,1,5 May 2008,"I wanted to like this film . As a big fan of Steve Carell I kept coming back to this film hoping there would be something likable about it .Nope .Dan's daughters "" In Real Life "" are the most irritating and maddening human beings ever to appear in a movie . You thought Meryl Streep's son Roarke was annoying in the River Wild ? Not even close . How about Stallone's son in that Arm Wrestling movie ? A piker .If I had daughters like these I would send them to boarding school and then burn my house down and change my name . And did Dan ever snap and kill his offspring . Nahh . He just kept saying "" o - kay "" .Everything Dan did was met with criticism . "" Hapless in Seattle "" should have been the name of this BOMB .

175,juan0588,Breathtakingly Insipid,1,14 April 2008,"Sweet lord - that was my thought 10 minutes into the movie. I was so bored. I couldn't stand the characters. Where are the axe wielding maniacs when you need them? I totally despised Dan. What a self-absorbed,whining pile of dog vomit he was. And the family, what a bunch of busy bodies. Dan comes across a pathetic loser. He meets a new woman, and at the first meeting, he is spilling his guts. That really made me cringe. Afterwards, he walks around like a 16-year old with a cross. Part of the plot is that his wife had died. To be honest, I think she blew her brains out in order to get away from this clown. Then when the mystery woman shows up at the reunion as his brother's girl friend, Dan's real colors come out - what an a-hole. He needs a good b*tch slapping. At a family dinner, he was incredibly sarcastic to his brothers new girl friend. If I was the brother, I would have taken him out back and gotten medieval on Dan.",Dan in Real Life
176,rasto_novak,Lot of fun and touching moments,8,27 March 2013,"When I started to watch this movie, I thought it'll be another average movie from Steve. But after a few minutes I realized that the representation of family in here it's quite close to what I know in person. A big plus for this movie is that the most of it occurs in a big family surrounding, another great thing is the countryside. Lot of familiar actors made all of the scenes hilarious. Dan's everyday troubles with love and his daughters are touching and also a bit provoking. These issues let the audience think – ""what would I do, if I were him?"" One of the greatest moments of the whole movie is the scene where everybody plays a little act for the others. The song that Dan's brother choose I never heard before. It is my most favorite song ever since! The whole scene, where Dan only plays and then Mitch loses lyrics so Dan has to take over also the singing, is just outstanding. In a meanwhile, the background talk of Dan's sister with Maria even more escalates the emotional legacy of this scene. I liked this very much. I did even find this scene on YouTube and played it several times since I first saw this movie. As all of you might assume, the movie ends with happy ending, but before the conclusion, there are some quite funny moments. I definitely recommend this flick to all family-movie lovers. After all, I personally think that Steve and Juliette played their characters very well.",Dan in Real Life
177,trigaba,Dan and the Family Stone,5,9 November 2007,"When I first saw the spots for this picture, I was intrigued to see this hilarious-looking heart-warming comedy about a single father advice columnist trying to raise his 3 daughters. Awkward parenting situations leading to professional conflicts were well on their way.Then I saw this picture, and it started off fine... Until Dan left his REAL LIFE and went to his parents' home where an exchange of significant-sibling-others takes place (sound familiar?). It's The Family Stone all over again, plain and simple. And anyone who thinks this film has anything to do with Dan's real life clearly either doesn't have a family or lives with their family (or most importantly, doesn't celebrate holidays with family they love but still rarely see).More examples of a lack of real life? Dan's profession has practically nothing to do with the film. We see him typing up a column in the beginning, he mentions it a couple of times, there's the meeting, he talks about how he doesn't follow a column that I was not led to believe he could write, and that's about it. We never really hear any of the column, or him give any advice really. I really don't believe his column could even be that good from what this film gave me.Then there's Dane Cook. I like Dane Cook, I think he's hilarious. But he appears once in the spots, so I figure it's like ""Waiting..."" where his plays a minor character in Dan's Real Life. But it turns out he plays a MAJOR roll in Dan's vacation, ensuing the Family Stone dynamic.More false advertising continues when a scene in which his daughter his behind the wheel and a fun, hilarious driver's ed scene appears. This scene is a part of Dan's real life, and is therefor nowhere to be found in the final cut.In short, there are many funny and heart-warmingly awkward moments, but if you enter expecting a struggling man dealing with the trials and tribulations of his real life and being a single father, you will be sorely disappointed. If you enter expecting a family-based romantic comedy that mirrors The Family Stone in more ways than one, you will enjoy this film very much.",Dan in Real Life
178,blueleftshoe,it is what it is... average,7,3 December 2007,Some movies just really stand out as being very good or very bad. This one is pretty much just average well I'll say maybe slightly above average. The acting was good for the most part no one really stuck out as overacting but at the same time I wouldn't say anyone deserves an academy award for anything done. The story was pretty brief not really explain much of who the characters where what they did or anything about them besides what was necessary. I suppose that could be good a lot of times you get movies that tell you more than you really need to know but I sort of feel like this one could of given a bit more there are tons of characters that you barely get to see or really understand who they are. The family was a bit over the top as well and I'm not entirely sure why all of them were in the house together to begin with there didn't seem to be any holiday or celebration going on... perhaps I'm a bit sheltered but I don't know too many families who do this. All that being said the movie was pleasant it made me laugh a big and even shed a tear or two. I enjoyed my time watching the movie I didn't feel as if I got robbed by another overrated movie but I must also say this movie is just um OK.,Dan in Real Life

180,ksmred2,Dan In Real is very warm.,8,24 December 2007,"Didn't plan to see this, but I've discovered a long time ago that movies are more enjoyable when you have no idea what it is about-in other words, unexpected surprises. Well, Dan in Real Life is one of those unexpected surprises. It was throughly charming and often funny, not as in laugh out loud funny but more of feel-good funny. Sometimes, comedies like this are the ones that get me more than the laugh out loud comedies (ex. Superbad). Its warmth totally won me over, like a puffy winter jacket. You don't want to wear it cause it looks ugly outside but later on, it wins you over cause it's warm inside. The movie is like that.The man on my left is Steve Carell, who I've despised for being himself, no not really, but he does seem to play same character in all of his movies. I am surprised to say he won me over in this film. His portrayal as an awkward, over-protecting widower was a spot on. I liked how calm and soft spoken he was in this film. I also thought his emotional scenes worked out very fine as well, because Carell made Dan a relatable and caring character even when it seemed he's a jerk in this film. No, let me put it this way: He made Dan a REAL father more than just a character.This is the definite definition of ""Feel good"" comedy. I liked Dan in Real Life for Real.",Dan in Real Life

Heaven knows I thought about turning it off, but it was a cold snowy day and I had nothing better to do.Every time you thought there might be a laugh, things went nowhere e.g., the scenes with the cop. There were so many preposterous situations I can't keep track of them. The Dane Cook character was awful, especially when he and Dan sang their putrid duet. How would a big nothing like that even have a girlfriend? I'm a Steve Carell fan; he even managed to make the silly ""Evan Almighty"" tolerable. But he does his career no favors with this stinker.",Dan in Real Life

This deserves to rank among the best movies of all time such as Baby Geniuses and The Adventures of Pluto Nash.

184,niceguy_1981,refreshing,7,21 February 2008,I had no Idea what to think of this movie going into it. But to be honest with you I was rather impressed with this movie. In a day were it seems like most movies have to be full of big explosions or lots of violence to have a movie that contains neither. This movie was simple with no fancy cinematography.The whole movie focuses on Dan who is a journalist and is also widowed with 3 daughters and goes to a family reunion and finds love in an unlikely place. And learns a lesson about relationships from his oldest daughter.The scenery in the movie was relaxing with the view of the ocean in the back ground and the unity of family displayed in this movie. It was very nice to see Steve Carell play a more serious role and did it surprisingly well. This is a must see,Dan in Real Life
185,vtownlove,OK Family fun movie,5,30 June 2008,"The Good: captures some of the nuisances of family life in today's day and age with good scenes and humor. The best part of the movie I felt was the restrained acting by Carrel and Dan Cook. Both are known to go over the top to get laughs. Here they're humor is more realistic and down to earth than in other movies. A couple laugh out loud scenes made it worth watching.The Bad: From scene two, you can pretty much guess how this is going to end up. Highly predictable writing leaves the viewer wishing for a little more out of the screen play. The movie also adds just way to many filler scenes to creep the movie toward the end. The bowling scene must have been hell to write and keep a straight face. How do we extend the movie and show what a great time our new couple is having? Just excruciating. Also, how unnecessary was the scene with pig face outside of setting up someone for Dane Cook to move on with. How horribly scripted. A monkey with a crayon could have penned something more intelligent than this scene.Overall: A decent movie but not a strong performance to make one see it again. I would recommend this movie to any of my friends who have children, are over 40, and are widowed. It may make more sense to someone in those shoes. And they may forgive the movies problems because of that fact.",Dan in Real Life
186,Impugn_Original,Starts bad...continues bad...ends bad.,1,4 August 2008,"Okay, first off, the obligatory, ""I'm a big Steve Carell fan...blah blah blah...BUT..."".You remember watching the Brady Bunch as a kid and, even at that age, being like, ""These people are so fake I want to punch them all in their collective faces. Real families do not behave like this.""? That's this movie.Let me start with the daughters. They all need their asses kicked...the middle one, especially. Any father that lets his kids push him around like Carell's character does, gets what he deserves. It all comes to a head when Dan's ho-bag of a daughter tells him she hates him and calls him a ""murderer of love"". I, myself, would be labeled ""murderer of a smart mouth little b****"" if I were Dan, but, hey, whatever. Let a kid give me lip in Spanish when he's trying to get in my 14 year old daughter's pants...and see if I don't have ICE raid his house inside of an hour. Instead of being a parent, let's hold our respective situations in equal regard and let the kid do what it wants. Why? Because it is easier to do. Kids are just little grown-ups, after all, right? (NO, THEY ARE NOT.) Let's hope this Baby Boomer method of self-centered ineffective parenting is increasingly a thing of the past.Then there is the family. Watching them interact actually made me angry. The only thing missing was a potato sack race across the astroturf backyard.The shower scene made me angry. Knock knock. ""What you doing?"" ""About to take a shower."" ""Can I talk to you?"" Now, we'll see how this comedy gem of a scene would have played out for me. ""I said I am about to take a shower."" ""I'll come in and talk to you."" ""Do you want your ass kicked? Get out of the bathroom. Go away. I'll talk to you later, maybe, but probably not because you are pissing me off."" Well, at least Dan wasn't caught in the laundry room with the lady because, as we can see from this movie, everybody within a half-mile is apt to be strangely compelled to do laundry at the same exact time.This movie never ends. It's like eating a bad biscuit. You chew it and it just gets larger. There is no payoff for your suffering. You get the typical end-of-movie wedding - in the credits.I honestly hated Little Miss Sunshine for being ""too cute by half"". That movie disappointed me, given all the hype and would be a 5, at most, for me. This is a 1 if there ever was one.Maybe some screen writers should try living in the real world for fifteen minutes. Maybe that would help?",Dan in Real Life

188,danny_holloway,Highly Enjoyable,7,28 March 2008,"When you see the names of Steve Carrel and Dane Cook on the cast list you automatically think ""Wacky comedy"". This is far from it. If i had to put this film into a genre i would call it a romantic comedy for mature adults. It's based around Carrels character Dan. He's a writer who helps people through general problems in life with his magazine column. He's wife has passed away leaving him to bring up 3 daughters alone. During a get together with his family, he takes a trip to the book store where he meets a women. A woman he instantly falls for. After having a bite to eat with her she quickly leaves for a prior engagement. Dan then returns to his family and is stunned to see the woman he met is his brothers (played by Cook) girlfriend. The film shows Dans struggle to come to terms with this shock whilst trying to deal with various family problems. It's brilliantly written and very witty. All in all a highly enjoyable movie. If your looking for crude jokes, wacky one liners or full on slap-stick comedy this is not for you. If you like a more mature movie, i would recommend this all day long.",Dan in Real Life
189,schmidtmike555-1,"Boring, unrealistic, stereotypical, unoriginal, one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",1,4 May 2008,"I'll start from the beginning. My first impression is that it's going to be a comedy, which ends up not being the case. I think I laughed maybe once or twice at parts that were supposed to be funny and at least ten more times at the parts that weren't.We first see that Steve Carrell's daughter is your stereotypical whining teenager who is constantly screaming about love, which few teens speak of in real life. To top it off, her boyfriend seems to chase after the car as her father drives away, as if all people do that.They then go to a family reunion where we meet some more lame stereotypes- a caring, loving, constantly smiling family that's painful to think of as realistic. When Steve finds out the girl he likes is his brother's girlfriend, he seems to throw a temper tantrum after finding out, making it blatantly obvious that he likes her in cases like when his brother sings her a love song and he finishes it for her, and yet his family can't figure out why. To punish him for throwing a fit, his parents make him do the dishes while they play a board game, as if he's a child. This could have been a funny joke if it was done correctly, but apparently it was a serious scene.Steve talks with her in a bathroom about getting over it, but hides in the shower when Steve's daughter walks in to talk to her. Steve's love says she was just about to take a shower and while she talks with the daughter, gets naked and jumps in the shower while Steve is already in there. WHO ON EARTH WOULD DO THAT? WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST TALK WITH HER OUTSIDE? WHO FINDS THIS ORIGINAL, FUNNY OR REALISTIC IN ANY WAY?Hoping to find out why Steve is acting strange, his parents ask him about his love life in the laundry room as a private conversation, when suddenly nearly the entire family walks in, apparently having to all do their laundry at the exact same time. Coincidence, or just bad writing? The stereotypical loving family set him up with a girl they invite and describe as pig-faced, and constantly make fun of her, singing songs about pigs knowing full well she could walk in at any moment, and whadayaknow, she walks in as soon as they finish singing, only to be, whadayaknow, a beautiful model, like in every movie, and Steve is, whadayaknow, interested in her now.They go to a bar and start laughing and joking until she suddenly tells them her boyfriend was killed in an accident and starts crying into a handkerchief (which I haven't seen in years in real life) for five seconds until she decides to turn on a juke box and start slow dancing all sexily like a stereotypical hot girl. Cue a pointless dance sequence that lasts nearly five minutes. The brother's girlfriend for some reason gets jealous about this even though she's taken and never really seemed interested in Steve from the start, taking it out on Steve, but breaks up with the brother soon after.In the middle of all this, Steve catches his daughter kissing her boyfriend and tells him to go home. Before he goes he tells Steve something in Spanish, then translates that it means something along the lines of ""You can't stop true love"" or something unbelievably cheesy like that. Why he told him in Spanish first, I have no freakin' clue. He drives away and his daughter chases after him uselessly and collapses in tears, screaming ""I hate you"" to her father, which makes the rest of the family angry at Steve for some reason. Who actually thinks this is original? Why doesn't anyone realize she's just a spoiled brat and Steve is the one who's really right?Steve meets his love at a bowling alley and kisses her when suddenly the entire family walks in to go bowling, after doing aerobics, crosswords, lame talent shows, football, etc. together previously. Honestly, how many families do that much at family reunions? Not to mention this bowling alley was implied to have been abandoned when Steve took his daughter and two kids he seemingly kidnapped there earlier. His brother punches him even though he already broke up with her. Regardless, they get married in the end seemingly immediately after the reunion. What the hell...This is a terrible movie, and I don't believe the score is really 7.1 out of 10. Do you honestly call this realistic? Who the hell made this awful movie?",Dan in Real Life
190,mathmangum,Worst Movie of the year,1,15 November 2007,"I saw this movie knowing nothing about it but that a good friend of mine really wanted to see it. Ten minutes into it I decided that I had wasted my money. The production quality of this film borders on amateurish. I'm very confident that any local independent production company could have pulled off this film, and spent a whole lot less money on it. I'm sure the only reason they spent much money on this film at all was to pay for the actors salaries, which are certainly more than they deserved in this film. Except for maybe the young girls, there is still hope for them. The storyline while holding a great deal of potential was just filled with too many filler scenes. If I want happy family scenes in my life I'll go hang out with my brothers and sisters and cousins, and it will be a whole lot more fun than paying for someone to try to entertain me on the big screen.",Dan in Real Life
191,consultfitz,Ensemble playing at its best,10,26 May 2010,"Every now and then a film comes along that transcends one's expectations to such a degree that its genre has to be re-assessed for its position as an attraction. Few RomComs do it for me, but when a group of true talents, such as those on display here, are allowed to run with a great script and imaginative direction, then magic follows. Not one of the actors here needs justification from me, but they all manage to bring that last degree from each other. Stalwarts like Wiest and Mahoney may be expected to enhance any project, but the performances from Juliette Binoche and Dane Cook were eye openers. Carell is rapidly showing himself to be the real deal, leaving some better known and better paid talents in his dust............the next Jack Lemmon?? The best comedies always include bitter sweet flavours, and this one balanced on my taste buds to perfection. A most unexpected and perfect delight.",Dan in Real Life

The characters played all their parts well. I don't remember anyone who didn't seem to fit. Those who put this ensemble together really deserve credit, and all the actors ability to meld - perfect. And Dane Cook, he was a pleasant surprise. But Steve Carvell never looked so charming to me - I was surprised by his ability to pull this off so well. Hysterical! Really tapped into the feelings of a single mother I'm sure (I'm not one but was raised by one :-) Beautiful. This Film Deserves great raves and reviews.

Put simply, it makes me happy.The feel of the whole movie is utterly charming. It's simple, it's real, with so many subtle nuances that you notice more things every time you watch it. It's funny, touching, uplifting, awkward, excruciating at times - everything real life is.It's also inspirational in a lot of ways, it paints a picture of a family weekend that's so warm and welcoming and comforting, who wouldn't want that? The characters are all very well cast in my opinion, I ADORE Steve Carell as Dan, he nails it! And Juliette Binoche is gorgeous as Marie.

She had me in tears for more than half the film! There seemed to be such chemistry between all the family members in the film. Like I felt like I was watching my family on the big screen.

195,Doctor_Wordsmith,"A well-made, sweet movie!",7,24 October 2007,"I saw a special advance screening of this today. I have to let you know, I'm not a huge fan of either Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I really had no expectations going into this. I ended up enjoying it quite a bit.Dan in Real Life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family. While at a bookstore, he meets the woman of his dreams, only to find out that she happens to be his brother's girlfriend.This movie is pretty well made- the soundtrack, cinematography, and acting are all top-notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development, mostly with Dane Cook's character. We never really get a close look at the relationship between Dane and Steve's characters, and I felt that it could have helped a bit in showing what Dan's inner conflict about being in love with Dane's girlfriend was like. Other than this though, Dan in Real Life is definitely a solid, sweet film- definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we've been getting this year.",Dan in Real Life

Of course it's ""what the cool kids are doing"" and it's trendy to love and appreciate those elements in a movie. I for one, found it to be a pleasant surprise that none of the aforementioned things were hosted in Dan in Real Life's story.The love, devotion and trust within the family emanated from the performances of every body in the cast regardless of age or experience in the field. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish, seeing Steve Carrell in more of a serious role (even though the film is a romantic comedy) was a nice change and the supporting cast all around did a great job to make this a very entertaining and enjoyable movie to watch.I would not hesitate to recommend this to anybody, whereas some films I would think twice about suggesting it to my parents or female friends, this movie will satisfy all but the most critical and cynical of moviegoers.",Dan in Real Life

I wanted to turn it off within the first like 10 minutes but I figured I'd give it a chance because it just hadddd to get better. Or at least have some redeeming qualities, like I figured at the very least it would be a make you think type movie, or like really intelligent, or very well filmed or something...Needless to say, that was not the case and I wasted about an hour and a half of my life. Im not even going to get into why its terrible because its a waste of my time to explain that this ""may contain spoilers""...IMDb, you should calm down on the spoilers thing and pay more attention to making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved somehow in the movie or anything else like that. I thought it would be humorous after this terrible film to come see hoe bad the rating would be and I was very very shocked to see the fairly high ratings...all the ratings with about 7-10 stars clearly must be about some COMPLETELY DIFFERENT movie... Im still a big IMDb fan, but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee like a 3.",Dan in Real Life

The soundtrack alone is the perfect backdrop to a lazy Saturday morning. Just one note from that trumpet in the opening credits and I'm ready to get cozy and watch the roller coaster that is Dan's life.Despite the crazy twist and turns of Dan's budding feelings towards Marie and the seemingly unconscious outbursts that accompany those feelings (""this corn is like an angel""), this movie feels so grounded in reality. This summer home full of a family so comfortable with their own craziness allows the audience to believe that these people could and do exist somewhere.This movie is a romantic comedy that doesn't take cheap shots or over play sentimentality. It is a clean and charming movie that I might just go watch again right now! Bring on the trumpets!",Dan in Real Life

Very disturbing.Where ""Lars and the real girl"" is a lovable, compassionate, tragic and very human, yes in essence a brilliant movie, ""Dan in real life"" is... nothing of the kind.Its shallow, its unlovable, its unempathical.Dan, father of three, is being lynch mobbed throughout the movie, by his daughters, by his mother, and we are expected to laugh about it? Its not funny. Its not done in a funny way, but a vicious.The movie don't expect us to to laugh about human tragedy, or the hardships of a single father. It expects us to laugh at him. On top of that we have this sadistic mother, a totally unbelievable family and a superhuman girlfriend with no wrongs at all. How on earth can people rate this a 10? This is not a feel good movie, and i cant understand how this can have such a high rating at IMDb. Some have suggested that its because of strategic manipulation. That just might be true.I do suggest to everyone to see this move though, and then come here and rate it. 7 is just too high. See it, and you will agree with me.I love romantic comedies, i love most of steve carrels movies to date, but this one.. it annoys me to no end that the rating of this move on IMDb actually got me to rent it.

201,JimmyMcNulty99,Dan in Real Life....not Real Good,2,29 August 2010,"I watched this movie last night on DVD. Perusing the various reviews on IMDb tonight, I am absolutely mystified by all the positive reviews. This is one of the most ludicrous films I have ever seen in my life. I usually give a movie a pass if once or twice things happen which don't make sense. Again and again in this movie, however, ridiculous implausibility followed ridiculous implausibility. My wife and I must have rolled our eyes a dozen times and exclaimed ""Oh, come on!"" during the course of this (mercifully short) disaster.Think I'm not being fair? First consider the transcendent idiocy of the shower scene and the utter lunacy of both the aerobics and talent-show scene. What family acts like this? The football scene you could sort of forgive, if that was the only familial bliss we were subjected to. You could imagine families horsing around playing football. But aerobics and talent shows on top of that? Consider also the laundry room scene, in which every adult in the film decides to do their laundry at the exact same time as though there were multiple washing machines in the room. Then there is the way Dan's mommy punishes him for his rudeness at dinner by making him do the dishes by himself as if he is eight years old. Finally, notice that everyone in this idiotic family seems to go to bed at the exact same time. The ending is the worst of all, however. Dan's bratty daughters suddenly approve of his love for Marie and demand that he pursue her. They travel to New York City and manage to locate her, conveniently enough, at her gym (where she met Dan's brother, I believe, which was the clue that led them to find her there). She just happens to be working out facing the front window. How convenient! And, while I'm ranting a bit, did anyone else find the scene where so many adults in the family were making fun of the allegedly ""pig-faced"" character a bit off-putting? In front of the kids, the adults were singing songs mocking this woman's supposed looks and setting as horrible an example as possible. And was anyone with a brain surprised when she turned out to be drop-dead gorgeous? (not to mention a doctor, as well!) I could go on and on. This was an awful,awful movie. Scarcely five minutes went by without something ridiculous or unbelievable happening. What utter rubbish.",Dan in Real Life
202,jonathanhara,Great movie,8,16 July 2008,"I feel bad for people who went out and saw this movie, expecting a 40-year-old Virgin remake. This is a great movie, ESPECIALLY because Steve Carrell is not overly silly. He is very believable, real AND funny, just not in an over-the-top psycho id way. As a father of 2 girls that had to face the reality of my wife's mortality, I could fully relate to Dan's loneliness and struggle to try and be a good father AND dad. I would fully recommend this movie to mature adults that want to be entertained and treated to a great love story.

I walked into the theater and was immediately captivated by the overall environment of the movie which seemed surreal, even though it took place in an average life. It's like its got a mellow flow throughout that only Carrel can bring - no flashy stuff, no intensely romantic scenes, no super-duper-blow-your-mind special effects, yet it was still so captivating; it was mostly just set in a believable family, even though the family was a bit...different. Overall, walking out of the theater, I felt this feeling of relaxation in my mind, like I had found solace in this movie.Great. Recommend it strongly.",Dan in Real Life

For the movie writers to drag this out into a mind-numbing hour and a half is a feat of sub-human proportions. Wow, what a snore-fest.The movie itself was just so dull, the dialogue so stilted and the acting and behaviour so devoid of any 'real life' connection that I was left with the question ""Who invested time and effort to make this movie?"" Even with Steve Carrell, who is such a funny guy in most other movies; what was he and his agent thinking when they signed him up for this stinker? Did they read the script first? Or did he just accept the part because he was the main character? True, you can connect with Steve Carrell in his emotions on-screen, which add dimension to his acting - but the whole love thing in this movie is foolish. The whole family converge to heap compliments and interest in this woman who is the girlfriend of Dan's brother. Who cares? In real life, I don't take an active interest in my brother's love life at all. I don't care, flat out, the end, this movie sucks; don't watch it, please.",Dan in Real Life

What's new about this film is that it doesn't try to be cinematic, instead it tries somewhat to capture realism and the comedy inherent in real life, hence the title. As a result of being ""realisitic"" it loses some of the magical elements a movie is able to posses, and the highs and lows become somewhat muffled. Much like Steve Carell's performance which sort of echoes that of his character in ""Little Miss Sunshine"", although once again he does hold his own well in this film.

208,timothyjang,An insult to your intelligence,3,14 March 2008,"Let me start off by stating how much I like Steve Carell as an actor. 40 Year Old Virgin is one of my all time favorite films and I've been enjoying his work since The Daily Show. Any problems I had with this film are not directed at him or any of the other actors in Dan In Real Life. The performances were fine. With that said, I have to warn you that this film is a total stinker.Dan is a loser. He is an utterly unlikable character who has few, if any, redeeming qualities. This story deals with him falling in love with a girl named Marie.The story kind of meanders from scene to scene with very little character development. By the end of the film, you don't really feel a bond with any of them. Instead of revealing characteristics through dialogue and action, the writer decided to beat you over the head with exposition. Instead of letting the audience figure out for themselves that Marie is nice and pretty, he'll have a character say, ""Gosh, Marie sure is nice and pretty."" That would be fine if there were substance to this story, but the plot is pretty thin as it is.There were 2 or 3 moments when I had a chuckle, but most of the film is a weird mashup of Partridge family style family games and Dan feeling sorry for himself. It gets boring really fast. I checked my watch 30 minutes into this film.Towards the end of the film, some of the characters were just stating the obvious. It's as if the writer didn't think his audience was intelligent enough to figure out the resolutions to painfully simple problems. Many of the 2-dimensional characters seem to be in the film solely to reflect Dan's hypocrisy.This film gets 3 out of 10 because it's a bad film, but not the worst I've ever seen (Le Samourai is the worst film I've ever seen). It has a couple funny moments and it's always nice to see Steve Carell on screen.

Steve Carell's Dan is immature and his obvious affection borders on stalker (at what point does shyness become social inaptitude--how is this man function in normal society?) and Juliette Binoche's Marie is manipulative and coy. Blech! There's absolutely no reason to think that these two belong together.

Our country has gone through a lot of moral changes in the last couple decades, and from me, not the best of changes. Its nice to finally watch a movie that has family values like this.The movie starts out with great character growth by learning about Dans life as it is with his 3 kids. He obviously loves them so much and it shows very well through, surprisingly, Steve Carells acting.When they meet up later with the extended family, lets just say the plot comes about. But what i extremely enjoyed was the Family. All of them come together, play games, eat together, and basically have a great time. No TV, No video games, No complaining.But don't be mistaken. They are in no way Brady like. It seems extremely real and awkwardly familiar to my own memories of my family gatherings.It was a great movie, and i advise all to see it.

When it became clear that this wasn't the case, I didn't give up on the movie. I started viewing it as a family movie for all ages. Even then, I wasn't completely overwhelmed by the film. There are several great scenes that leave you laughing (and sometimes crying). At the end of the day though, I'm glad it was a free showing. A few of my friends said they did enjoy it, but when I asked them if they would pay $8.50 to see it, they immediately declined.Bottom line: It's a pretty decent movie for the family to go see.

No, the acting was not bad at all, I just found the plot completely boring. The beginning was decent. The main character, Dan, falls in love with his brother's girlfriend. After that, it was just very repetitive. A few awkward moments, some of which were anything but funny. Most were him and his brother's girlfriend talking... about nothing imparticular. Some made me chuckle but nothing side-splitting. Their were parts where all you were doing was watching him sit there being bored. Other times it was like watching home videos of a family who you don't even know. Another thing that bugs me about movies in general is the atmosphere. If it is cloudy or rainy, it really sends off a bad vibe, usually resulting in a headache. Almost the whole movie was cloudy making it not very enjoyable.

These were the same people who I have relied on for a few years on what movies I should be seeing, and never have I been disappointed by these ratings, until those first minutes of ""Dan In Real Life"". The movie then, as it revealed the true of the purpose of the movie of being about Dan, hence the title, made a beautiful turn. This movie first and foremost is presented in such a simple and natural way, that it is almost perfect.

214,katiebird062,Movie Review,6,6 November 2007,"""Dan in Real Life"" is a movie of a widower with three daughters who falls in love with his brother's girlfriend. The story centers around Dan Burns (Steve Carell), a local newspaper columnist who gives parents advice on how to raise and deal with their children. Dan takes his daughters, Jane (Allison Pill), Cara (Brittany Robertson), and Lilly (Marlene Lawston), for a family get-together at his parents house. While out buying the paper one morning he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche), with whom he immediately strikes up a conversation.Marie ends up giving Dan her number, but has to quickly leave after she gets a phone call from her boyfriend. Dan goes home and begins to tell his family about the woman he has just met, only to be introduced to his brother Mitch's (Dane Cook) new girlfriend, Marie. Over the next several days Dan and Marie try to ignore their feelings for each other, only to eventually realize they cannot keep deceiving themselves or anyone else.""Dan in Real Life"" provides some decent laughs from the interaction between Dan, Mitch, and Marie. Dan's jealousy prompts him to say and do some ridiculous things, which are very entertaining. Also amusing is the slightly over-the-top, yet accurate portrayal of a dramatic teenage girl from Robertson. In her father's attempts to keep her away from her boyfriend, who she claims to have fallen in love with after three days, she falls into hysterics.While I enjoyed the movie it was perhaps not as good as it could have been. Well-known comic Dane Cook provides few laughs, and even Carrell's performance seemed slightly lackluster compared to his roles in other movies. With some exceptions, his comedy lacks the wit and hilarity he gives to his character in the television show ""The Office."" Although billed as a ""romantic comedy,"" the movie focuses just as much on familial relationships just as much, if not more, than romance. Dan's relationship with his daughters is just as pivotal as his with Marie, and his relationship with his brother and his parents are also important.""Dan in Real Life"" is an entertaining and touching movie that anyone can enjoy.",Dan in Real Life
215,leanes-1,"Unfunny, Un'heartwarming' and all round Ungood (and also predictable)",2,10 August 2008,"'Oh no! he's only gone and fallen in love with his brother's girlfriend!' is no longer a very good concept to create a film about. That is pretty much the be-all and end-all of my opinion on Dan in Real Life.For starters, let me just say for anyone confused; this is not a Frat Pack film, it is not laugh out loud funny and it's not Steve Carrell using the funny voice he uses in Anchorman (and every other film he's in, not that i don't love that voice).Anyone expecting the kind of Frat Pack Rom-Com excellence that 40 Yr Old Virgin supplied shouldn't watch this film. Fans of typical Carrell roles shouldn't watch this film. People who are middle-aged women who like to watch pathetic, whimsical and 'cute' men struggle with their emotions, however, should watch this film...that's the only really target audience as far as i can see.Steve Carrell puts a valiant effort into trying to make this poor concept into a good film, but i don't think any actor could do it. He manages to portray being a pathetic and 'love-struck' man well (and that's not me calling Carrell pathetic, i blummin love him) but this role, this script and this film-in-general just reeks of cliché, predictability, unrealisticness and all-round rubbishness... but maybe i just don't have enough oestrogen to enjoy it.",Dan in Real Life

Juliette Binoche is lovely, Emily Blunt has a really funny scene and Steve Carrell is good as always. But overall, I was disappointed and hated most of the other characters. I wanted all the daughters to be given up for adoption and Dane Cook should not be allowed to act in film ever again. I gave the movie a five because the good scenes are REALLY good, just too far and in between for me. I felt like I was watching ""The Family Stone""-another movie about a completely unlikable family. Steve Carrell's character would be best to ditch the fam, move to Paris with Juliette's character and forget they knew the horrid family they left behind.

This movie will be a ""grocery line"" talked about film and I promise you will see many similarities in your life, or someone's you know.

218,theteenexpert,A Must-See DVD,8,17 July 2008,"This movie wasn't the greatest movie of the year. But it really was the most under-rated movies of the year. Here's my overall ratings:Actors: 7 | Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche were both great performances, and were both real believable characters. I personally watch a lot of Steve Carell, and I usually I see Steve Carell in all his movies. In this movie, you knew Steve was there, but you saw Dan, which is why I was so impressed with his performance. Juliette Binoche also impressed me, as she continues her amazing international career. Her performance almost out-shines the performance of Carell if people didn't know either actor. However, I was disappointed with the supporting cast. John Mahoney and Dianne Wiest were good, but not to their typical form. But Dane Cook was the most disappointment. But all in all, there was almost no development in the characters as we'd all would have liked. Even the Dan's daughters (with exception of one, a little of the second) doesn't develop. There were too many characters to know, and the important characters were just developed as the ones who weren't. Cinematography: 6 The story didn't develop as much as I wanted it to, but maybe because there wasn't much development (like I said previously). It really didn't seem like the writers cared about the sub-characters, just putting a family there. Don't get me wrong; the family was there and throughout the movie, family things happen, and you feel part of the family. But it's as if you know nothing about your own family. You knew they were there, but you had no sense what kind of people they were. However, you really did enjoy the way that the way Carell's and Binoche's character met and how it runs its course throughout the movie. This was originally a 5. But the chemistry between Dan and Marie bumps it up. Music: 10 | Sondre Lerche was brave enough to do a whole soundtrack for a movie, which I tip my hat to him. Most of the songs, on its own, sound empty and not as enjoyable. However, the music in the movie fits the scenes perfectly. Both the family waltz and the Dan and Marie Themes were familiar and catchy. I really liked the Dan and Marie Themes very much. But the best part was that they weren't over-used, which adds to this great soundtrack. He had visiting artists as well, but overall, the work was all Lerche. (Was it ""Real Life""-can you connect to the movie?) Believability: 8 | The fact is that the movie is almost believable. It's not perfect, and much of the humor seemed forced. However, families in real life do seem to have some forced humor. The activities the families did were very believable. But I do have to lower the score because, in real life, the climax and falling resolution of the movie didn't seem very believable. The complete ending was an okay one, but it could have been better. However, the beginning until the climax is very believable and really makes the movie do well. Overall: 7 | Dan in Real Life is really a must-see DVD. It's not worth watching at midnight in theaters, and you shouldn't have to adjust your time to see in theaters. However, it is worth watching on DVD, which I do recommend. It's one of those movies that you wouldn't mind watching more than once. But, if you're not a ""love story"" person and just wanted to see two funny actors (though there were a less tan fair amount of funny parts), this movie will disappoint you.",Dan in Real Life
219,petraMV,Don't waste your time and patience on this one,2,22 March 2009,"This movie was ""laboring"" through its duration. Very poorly written and plodding along, there was just no entertaining moment. Juliette Binoche looked very tired and and poor Steve Carell is absolutely wasted in this role. His hangdog look (aka his ""lost in love"" look) just kept itching for a resounding slap from the audience. Also, the situations where his character and Marie are thrown together seem extremely contrived.Steve, do us and yourself a huge favor and stay clear of these romantic sappy movies. I know you were exploring if this genre was up your alley, but it is *so not*!

220,uptonic,Irritating role played by Carell,4,26 July 2010,"Firstly, the reason I give this film a 4 as opposed to a 1, is because its an easy viewing Sunday afternoon flick. It has a gentle pace with some really touching performances. However, whoever created the role of Dan must have a dark perception of love and obsession.In this movie, Dan makes me want to pull my eyes out of the sockets. Where everyone else in the setting seem to be relatively normal, Dan is completely creepy, intense and selfish. It wouldn't be so hard to watch if that was his intended character. But it appears that the director of this movie wants you to feel his frustration and understand his ways. All I feel is a role being played way too strong and as a result, making the film unenjoyable and extremely irritating.So I would strongly advise people to avoid this movie and if its a dose of Carell you're after, go for Little Miss Sunshine. Its the same slow pace but its well produced.I have to say, being a Steve Carell fan, this movie almost ruined my appreciation of his work.. before it was half way through.",Dan in Real Life
221,ilikegoodmovies2,Can there really be a spoiler....,5,29 October 2007,"... when the ending and every cute zig and smarmy zag is telegraphed so completely in advance? I read a previous comment that said if you like thoughtful comedies like ""Arrested Development"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine"" then you'll love this - I've got to say, if you love AD and LMS, then you'll probably be bored. Don't get me wrong, there were a few scenes (You are a murderer of LOVE!!) that made me laugh a bit. But it didn't have the guffaws of Arrested Development or the uncomfortable, cringe-inducing humor of The Office or Curb Your Enthusiasm. It was an ordinary cute movie - and if you're a girl with an evening of 'turn your brain off' RomCom on the docket, you could do worse... But could certainly do a lot better. I guess my main problem was that this movie didn't really represent anything that usually happens (or is that funny) in 'real life'.

Actually, I was searching for Emily blunt's movie, and here, I met again with this movie. Unexpected, this movie is quiet pretty refreshing. I always like Steve Carrel's works, which he plays a lot of never give up - sadly character. For sure, this movie is not so original and realistic, like other reviews blabbering about. But for me it's not such a big problem. Sometime, you need Imperfection to be perfect. One last thing, the great family reunion situation gives some flashback memories for post modern generation parents like me, which usually to busy to have a warm great family gathering. Highly recommended for all those who miss their big families time and love.",Dan in Real Life

It isn't something that can easily be compared to films of the past, it's a unique take on a sort of classic middle-aged depressed love story.I was particularly struck by the casting of the film. Down to every last extra in the family, it was a beautiful and talented cast. The three daughters did a wonderful job, the talent was evenly dispersed between them and none of them ""out-shone"" the other two.It was truly a delightful film, appropriate for all ages and laugh out loud funny while also being truly touching and heart warming. It was a wonderful break from the sex jokes and nudity of recent films.",Dan in Real Life
225,comedyismyreligion,Dan in Unreal Life,3,21 March 2008,"I think if the filmmakers were honest with themselves, they would admit that this movie is dishonest. The character's actions are not based on anything resembling true human emotions or motivations. Instead, characters often behave in a cute clever manner when it suits the storyline. Time and time again, well beyond what you'll find in any other routine flick, the actors are given words and deeds to create a fake moment and not something real. Dan, it's fair to say, is mistreated by his entire family. A family that is seemingly so loving that they force their son on a blind date and then make fun of the girl they've set him up with. Reading the comments which are strongly for or against, I hope if our society breaks down, that I might find myself on the side of those who see through this horrible film.",Dan in Real Life

It was almost as though Carrell was trying to break character but although i recognised a few points at which humour was attempted the laughter just did not flow. The scenes were too sketchy and there was no real flow of action, though the characters were identifiable they were not believable and the plot line made this supposed Rom com into a soppy family film, disappointing. Carrell's acting was strong in the ways he managed to put across the frustrations and mixed emotions of family life but with the exception of his daughters he was poorly supported and the comedy did not flow. Others may enjoy it but i beg you Steve, bring back the laughter!",Dan in Real Life
227,baccamon,Very Contrived + Very Predictable = Extremely Boring,3,17 March 2008,"Being a Steve Carell fan, I opted to watch this film with my wife and mom-in-law (knowing full well the synopsis read as a cheesy romantic comedy). The movie, for us, turned into a contest to see who could predict the next occurrence. And we were all very successful. Marie being the brother's girlfriend? Mom-in-law predicted that while they were still ""falling in love at first site"" at the book store. The bowling alley surprise walk in? I got that one.The movie ripped off the formula for The Family Stone in such a blatant way that I wonder if the same writers just re-hashed the script with new character names. It even included a similar bar scene.As for cheesy-ness factor: The boys against girls crossword puzzle scene? The dance kick-box scene? Diane Wiest's over-the-top overbearing motherliness? And when did this huge family find time between all their activities to rehearse for that talent contest? This movie entertains those who enjoy this genre of films despite the repeated use of the same old film formula. And Steve Carell is still about as funny as they come in delivering his lines. But he spends the majority of the movie moping around while being teased by his brother's girl friend and whined at by his bratty daughters. And did I mention the movie was really boring?!",Dan in Real Life
228,thrillkillgirl,unrealistic family and just plain boring,2,18 March 2008,"I rented this movie with high expectations, I've enjoyed everything i've seen Steve Carell in so far ""little miss sunshine"", ""the office"", and ""40-year-old virgin"". After the first 10 minutes I realized this movie wasn't going to be what I expected. Every time this movie was trying to be funny, it failed miserably. Most of the scenes that were supposed to be funny were played out, for example he falls off the roof and gets pulled over by the police multiple times, you have seen it in many other movies, and you have seen it done better. This movie was also very painful to watch, I had to smirk just to hide how embarrassed I was for this movie. Above everything else the family was completely unrealistic. In order to find humor in watching a family gathering like this, there has to be some dysfunction, there has to be some conflict, something we can relate to, because no family is perfect like this. I feel that the writers just ran out of things for the actors to say, so instead they gave us dozens of family activity scenes, such as a crossword puzzle contest, touch football, charades, family bowling, a family talent show, etc. The worst part about these scenes is there's nothing funny about them or entertaining. Less than half way through this movie I just gave up, and started browsing online, I just wanted the movie to end. I only watched the full movie, so I could fairly give it a review. I would never watch this movie again, I wouldn't want to own this movie even if it was free, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.I usually don't review movies, but I just didn't feel that it was fair that so many people gave this movie 10 stars on here.",Dan in Real Life

I will agree that there were times that it was corny and not a lot of families are that close, but let's face it, it wasn't awful. And I generally don't watch these types of movies so...I have this opinion of Steve Carell: not as funny as everyone thinks. However, I am not a fan of The Office so maybe my opinion doesn't count. This movie was good and Juliette Binoche was great. It was great to see a different side of Carell than we are use to seeing. Maybe you should watch it again and let your mind relax.

I realized though that his family were all really hard on Dan in the movie. Probably because they expected more of him being the oldest. But others in the family did hypocritical things.

By the end, we each had a splitting headache, felt devoid of brain cells and serotonin and wanted to end the night early.We already did not like it around 20 minutes in, but decided to give it a chance since we typically love Steve Carrell. Much to our regret, it never improved. The old adage ""trust your gut"" rings true.The characters were annoying and unlikeable. The plot was equally ridiculous and tedious to get through. There was nothing redeemable about it. I would not waste a single cent nor most importantly, a single shred of your time trying to force yourself through this nonsense.",Dan in Real Life

Now having developed PTSD, the night I watched dan was the night I lost my sanity.

The set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie, even if the rest of the movie was good (which it isn't) There's almost no chemistry between the leads, and Steve Carell's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not funny. It's hard to believe Binoche's character would have any interest in him. Then in the end it's all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after. Isn't that great America!",Dan in Real Life
234,writtenbypatrick,"Sweet, Funny, Touching...Just About Perfect",10,4 October 2007,"I got to see this film at a preview and was dazzled by it. It's not the typical romantic comedy. I can't remember laughing so hard at a film and yet being moved by it. The laughs aren't gags here--they're observations, laughs of recognition, little shocks of ""Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!"" I won't give away the plot, which is more than just ""Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend."" The whole family plays a part in the relationship here. Probably the best blend of laughter and warmth since ""While You Were Sleeping."" Steve Carell goes much deeper than he's gone before, and for the first time I really liked him. The cast is amazing, a list of veteran theater actors whom I've loved in other roles, but they blend to make a convincing family. Dianne Wiest is lovely as the mother, Juliette Binoche is luminous and hilarious (who knew she was funny?), and even the reviled Dane Cook gives a warm, quiet, touching performance. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a wonderful addition, and I'll buy the CD the second it's available.Don't miss this one.",Dan in Real Life

I'm especially amazed how Peter Hedges makes us know the characters the instant they appear, through their gestures, their clothing , and through how they say what they say. There is nothing spectacular about Peter Hedges or his movies, it's just immediate, heartfelt cinema. If you like the work of Richard Curtis and / or Roger Mitchell, you will like this one very much.I would have preferred Jason Falkner or Roger Manning Jr. for the soundtracks, though, but that's just a personal preference :-)",Dan in Real Life

I was fortunate enough to see a free screening of this movie at my college. All I can say is I am so glad I went to see it. The story is very well written and Steve Carell does a great job acting. He seems very natural and the funny elements of the movie are very good and well thought out. I couldn't count how many times I laughed out loud. The story is a very feel good one as well, showing Carell doing the best he can to balance himself against his family while still looking out for everyone he cares about. After the movie was over though I honestly had a good feeling inside. You cannot be disappointed, with such a great plot and cast. As I have already said I highly recommend seeing this movie.",Dan in Real Life
237,connellylynn,A film for all ages,10,26 October 2007,"So glad I saw this film before anybody gave away of the twists and turns. Adorable children, fantastic cast and beautifully written. Definitely the funniest movie of the year. Steve Carrel was terrific and Juilette Binochi was a breath of fresh air. She looked the part and wasn't required to loose 50 pounds and dye her hair blonde like most leading ladies. She is a wonderful actress and conveyed so much with a simple look or gesture. Having seen most of Steve Carrel's other work,I must admit that either he is successfully refining his talents or he has finally being given a part that he could really sink his teeth into. It was also refreshing to step back in time and observe a large family reunion like the ""good old days"". To see the generations playing together, competing together and eating together is apparently not the norm anymore and it was like a walk down memory lane. Notice that the family never turned on a TV or video game or needed a plush vacation home complete with pool and hot tub. There wasn't even a gross word or gesture. How great is that!!!This movie is a must see.",Dan in Real Life
238,gmherp-2,"Really, really lame",1,26 October 2007,"Spoiler: Bunch of passive-aggressive people having family reunion. The script has them saying and doing things people would never do, at least anyone with a shred of decency. The hero falls for a woman he sees as his soul mate at a bookstore the day of the reunion, unaware she will show up as his brother's girlfriend at the reunion. He tries to defer to his brother's claim, but she, knowing our hero is clearly infatuated with her, teases him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothing and behaving like a stripper, rubbing all over the brother in a ruse excuse that she is showing him how to stretch. At one point, she actually disrobes and gets into a shower with him. He tries to cover his eyes. His heart is breaking. She thinks it's funny, until she suddenly decides she doesn't want the brother and leaves the reunion.The movie really drags. The audience coughed and fidgeted its way through the long haul. The writing is unintelligent and unbelievable. We almost walked out, but kept thinking surely something would happen that would perk things up, but nooooo. All the lovely reviews must have been written by paid shills, out to dupe poor suckers like me into seeing crap like this. Comparing it to Little Miss Sunshine??? Jeez. Shame on them, the writers, the actors, the producers, and the theaters for letting anything this bad make it to the screen!",Dan in Real Life
239,sbrookie404,I didn't like it,2,28 October 2007,"Dan in Real Life was not the best movie i've ever seen by far. The acting was OK, but the way they captured the audience was just so boring. It was if they didn't want to keep the audience interested at all. The plot wasn't original but it wasn't completely boring either. One brother falls for the other brother's girlfriend, basically. They could have made it a lot more interesting and could have even had a little more fun with it. Steve Carell has done a better job acting in many other movies, in my opinion Dane Cook was the best acting-wise out of the whole cast. It seemed that no one really put 100% effort into their acting abilities. When doing this they loose their audience's attention. I myself was bored after the first hour of the 2 hour film. If you are deciding whether or not to see this movie, don't! It's a waste of your money, especially when the movie prices are so costly now days. Instead go see a movie that won't put you to sleep.",Dan in Real Life
240,fuzzyturnip,Insipid Movie disguised as heartwarming,1,28 October 2007,"I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't bring myself to it. The family was completely fictionalized - there is no family on this planet like that and if there is, they belong in an institution for sociological study. Juliette Binoche's character was fetishized to pointless idolatry. Why? Because she's a ""sophisticated, worldly"" woman with a French accent? I could not understand the connection and felt no energy whatsoever between her character and Dan.Other than that, it felt like a 90 minute sitcom with a tidy little ending. What attracted her to Dan? He wasn't particularly funny or charming or interesting - she simply felt sorry for him because his wife died. The touching moment(s) were incredibly manipulative and forced. I did not buy that three girls who love their mother who passed away four years ago readily and easily and happily accept this other woman into their father's life so wholeheartedly. I do not buy that the ENTIRE family seems to be entranced by this mythical, UNREAL creature (Binoche's character). And the character was not well-developed enough, I did not see what everyone loved about her so much. She simply smiled a lot throughout the movie. The other two women who played Dan's sisters-in-law and sister were equally attractive and probably more interesting if their characters were fleshed out a little bit. Other than working out and being a bad bowler, what were we supposed to like about Binoche? She's a fantastic actress, to be sure, but she was horribly miscast in this film. Her true talent and beauty do not shine here as they do in the short for Paris Je'Taime.Sorry. Hated it. Life does not happen this way, at all. Also, there is no family in the world like this. The filmmakers are obviously living in a complete fabricated world of East Coast perfect family get-togethers. PLEASE! Not even ONE dysfunctional or remotely dysfunctional character? The whole thing was just trite. Rent Once if you want to see real characters fall in love.",Dan in Real Life
241,ucuzbay,nice movie,10,29 October 2007,"In fact, his three daughters were the only thoroughly admirable people in the whole movie, and they, together with Juliette Binoche's character, were the only totally likable ones. Dianne Wiest and John Mahoney are both great actors, and likable actors, but their parts here were more like stand-ins. I never believed ANY of these people, except the three daughters, were actually related to each other, or had ever really lived together, or shared a single childhood experience. Something that would have made this family, and their alleged past real, was simply missing.The home life at Dan's parents was a bit odd. The house had the look of a ""family manse,"" with two generations of close and full living--- mementos, nick-knacks, and the accouterments of 60 years of rich family living, piled all around. Kids' paintings on the fridge door, faded photos on the wall. Comfy but worn furniture all around. But none of the characters seemed to inhabit any of it.",Dan in Real Life

Very few laughs,completely unbelievable, screenplay was painful! What a waste of Juliette Binoche, terribly miscast. She was absolutely unbelievable in this ridiculous role.Dane Cook was OK, the whole father/daughter relationship was silly. I ended up fast-forwarding through much of this movie. Maybe I missed the whole point of this movie, I just did not find it funny or sweet or insightful. I cared nothing about the characters.The only thing I liked was the end, because thankfully it was over!I was extremely disappointed that this movie has such a high rating. I used this database for recommendations. It is obviously in the tank, since there is no way of policing who posts.

243,chere43,A Delightful Treat for Adults,9,1 November 2007,"The most satisfying element about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank goodness, appropriately aged for the part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster.Another wonderful aspect about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the ""frat pack"" formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes. ""Dan in Real Life"" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from ""Dan in Real Life"" are more natural and clever, and involve some thinking on the part of the audience.My only problem with ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson. It's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. Either way, her character is unrealistic and annoying. But, this is only a minor flaw in the film, and does not take away from the story as a whole.All in all, ""Dan in Real Life"" is a great film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. The quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It is simply a beautiful, light-hearted comedy.",Dan in Real Life

Loved all the singing moments with brothers and talent show- couldn't get that song out of my head for hours. Juliette Binoche was perfect for this role- I was less familiar with her as an actress.

I have read most of the reviews and have to say that while it may be true that most families don't have talent shows and play touch football at every family reunion... It shouldn't be said that the movie on a whole is unrealistic because of it. I say that as someone who comes from a family that has had talent shows in the living room and played games in the front yard when we are all together.I think this is a great movie.

The movie has a very simple story that could have been written by a twelve year old, and some of the scenes are down write stupid and unrealistic.

There is huge cast that has no role in the movie and the story seems to focus on one particular person. This movie is slow, boring and does not have any humor in it.

There is no way any human being (not related or financially connected to the actors) could sit through this insipid rot and honestly score it above a 2 or 3. I don't even know where to begin. Maybe with the implausible relationship projected by the main character and his family. The elements of the unimaginable family reunion; talent show, crossword puzzle contest, touch football game, that have all been painfully discussed by many others on this forum. Not one character is ever developed. The script is just plain silly. I really could go on and on about how completely bad this movie is. My main objective is to get the rating down on this so no one is drawn in by false claims like I was. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this one.

I figured the ending could make up for all this. Nope. Never once did his children or his family apologize or get mentioned that their behavior was wrong or out of line. In the end he was made to look like the guy who was wrong. His kids weren't disciplined for seeing a guy behind his back, disobeying, talking back, throwing tantrums, and yelling at their dad rudely. And he is apologizing in the end telling his kids he messed up. Their actions never get addressed. The kids run the household and let me tell you that doesn't work in real life. he just takes their crap. in fact, he gives in to all their tantrums.Also the family never supports either him or his brother. The girlfriend leaves his brother and his family doesn't say ""Sorry or you'll find someone better."" No. they say we really liked her. so much for helping family out. this family is not perfect in any way.I was so outraged when I finished this movie that I went online to see other reviews. SURELY someone else noticed these disrespectful kids. Very few reviews mentioned it",Dan in Real Life
255,jons-29,Two things:,4,14 May 2008,"I enjoyed the movie for the most part, although I kept thinking to myself: ""Good god, there isn't a family out there who is this nauseatingly cute."" Even the dysfunctional aspects of the family were portrayed such that it was a slice of Norman Rockwell.Maybe it's my own wack-o upbringing, but it was just hard to regard the dinner scene, the touch football scene, the jazzercise scene, the hide and go seek scene, and the talent show scene without just a little bit of eye-rolling. No family is that sappy and sweet. Here's a bit of trivia: The newspaper syndicate representatives who come to interview Dan at the house have the same names as Peter Hedges' high school drama teachers (Jim and Cindy Lamson). I sat next to Peter in one of those classes and babysat once or twice for the Lamsons.",Dan in Real Life
256,bobdinn,I have never hated anything as much as this movie,1,8 June 2008,"Lets put two comedians in a movie and have them play normal characters that don't do anything funny the whole movie. Then lets make the movie full of awkward situations and unbelievable circumstances. The plot goes no where and the whole movie is like watching paint dry. In fact I would rather watch paint dry. I'm lucky I don't own a gun or I would have shot my brains out instead of finishing the movie. I'm glad to see Steve Carell has such great acting range; He can be absolutely hilarious or completely boring. But I blame that on the director rather than on him. I can't believe some people wrote good reviews about this, maybe when I'm 55, single and brain dead I'll find it heartwarming and entertaining.",Dan in Real Life
257,blossomsandblessings,Steve Carell is no longer just a funny man.,10,9 June 2008,"I rented this movie just because Steve Carell was in it, and thought it would be funny, but it was SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT! I am going through something very similar in my life, and step for step, the story line rang true...then add the pathos that Steve Carell brought to the part...he made me FEEL this movie. When he explains LOVE to his brother, and the words were blurting out of his mouth because he was feeling them...when he sings for Marie and just peeks at her rather than being more obvious, then, when she calls him on it, the face he makes because he can't SAY he loves her, was perfect. The awkwardness and outbursts as he tries to restrain his feelings were funny but poignant. I've seen people pan Juliette Binoche for her part, but the chemistry between her and Steve was warm and wonderful. For those who doubt the kids' parts, I have two girls, and I bought it! A single parent becomes their children's scratching post sometimes. The struggle to become a PERSON again, and not just a parent was compassionately portrayed. I JUST LOVE THIS MOVIE!!",Dan in Real Life
258,jonstringer1,Poor script and over an sentimental plot don't make up for a good cast,4,17 August 2008,"A good example of what happens when a movie studio attempts to make a sentimental love story. The plot twists are obvious and the supporting characters cardboard cut out. The cast is full of good quality actors but they are really let down by a weak script. Its not a terrible movie and is fine for a evening DVD but it has all the cues of a good film (nice folk indie intro tune - check, good international cast - check) but simply fails to deliver.Go and see Juno or Little Miss Sunshine instead of this poor example of a romantic comedy. Come on Steve Carrell you know you can do better than this and as for you Juliet Binoche - shame on you!",Dan in Real Life
259,erin-461,That is time I can never get back,1,20 August 2008,"The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on the IMDb just makes me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this utterly horrific film.I have no words, no idea where to start to describe the truly awful film I sat through last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast.The dialog was so contrived, the family was this cookie cutter Walton's family and the film has been so many times before that I am shocked someone thought it was an original idea.Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terrifyingly bad movie and don't believe everything you read on the IMDb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different theater watching a GOOD film.",Dan in Real Life
260,ngmail,This movie is a jackass,3,6 September 2008,"Horrid feel-good ending. Hacky dialogue, contrived, obvious musical choices (the song lyrics occasionally explain the subtext of a scene). This movie is a total jerk.You invite it into your house under the misconception that you're going to watch Little Ms. Sunshine II and it comes in and tells you that the best kind of joke is a dick punch joke. This movie is a dick.This movie can eat a dick.It can eat so many dicks.Dicks.Eat em.",Dan in Real Life
261,vincentx90,rapturous applause,10,11 May 2009,"This is a sublime piece of film-making. It flows at just the right pace throughout. The accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear. The humorous parts are hilarious and made even more so by the largely depressingly tragic nature of the film.However, despite much comment about the inherent tragedy of the storyline it was anything but depressing for me to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed it in a way that I haven't experienced for a long time. That is to say, it is superb and yet without all the common trappings of modern films such as; sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. 'Dan In Real Life' lacks nothing for being without the regular vices. It has a fully matured plot that just doesn't require, and indeed would be ruined by, any further embellishment. At the same time, the theme is entirely adult. It's a piece of art in and of itself that encapsulates you entirely and you want for nothing more than it already offers.There are some scenes that feel a bit 'Waltons' but these actually make perfect sense in the long run as they contrast the more dysfunctional moments. The rosier makes way for the tragic which then gives over to the idyllic which turns to the darker etc. This undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium-like stability. The peaks and troughs are gentle but more than adequate in the pleasure they instill.I highly recommend watching this film regardless of what genre you normally enjoy. Put aside any prejudices because this is a must see!",Dan in Real Life
262,WestwoodLC,A classic adult romantic comedy with heart.,10,27 October 2007,"""Dan in Real Life"" is this year's ""Little Miss Sunshine"" .... a well-written, smart, original and very funny (yet poignant) movie about those things in life that matter most to us all : love and family.It is wonderfully cast and beautifully acted by old pros like Juliette Binoche and Dianne Wiest; emerging talents like Emily Blunt; and the gifted Steve Carell, (a comic actor, rather than a comedian).The thought and care that went into the details is evident from the extraordinary choice of locale for this movie and from such notable touches as the great bowling alley scene and the terrific double-dating episode.This fine effort has resulted in a classic adult romantic comedy with heart.",Dan in Real Life
263,Carlo_Zappella,"I really liked it for the fact, that it was a ""charming romantic comedy""",9,19 May 2010,"no spoilers here, my friendsWell.First thing, you'll notice is the music and the DPs work. It's like, the DP and the director heard the music and wanted to make a film out of it. The mood is, or better to say was very enhanced in this movie. It also had some really funny scenes like (no spoilers). Therefore, I usually watch action type of movies(guy ritchie's for instance) I also liked this genre and am looking for more films from Peter Hedges.So, I'll definitely see it again sometime and I think you should see it.-carlo",Dan in Real Life
264,pretendmadrid,Vomit-inducing,2,24 May 2011,"The majority of murders are committed within a domestic setting. No doubt, Dan's family is the kind of oh-so-loving, oh-so-talented family that Hollywood would love us to aspire to. However, if I had to spend a weekend cooped up with these people, I, too, would be reaching for my revolver.The plot is mundane, the dialogue trite in the extreme. In this environment, even JB's charms are less than enticing.I laughed a lot, but I don't think I laughed in the places intended by the writers and director.I'm glad this was on TV, and I hadn't paid extra to watch it. I was going to switch over a third of the way through, but there was nothing to watch on the other channels. The car-crash element kept me hanging on all the way to the oh-so-predictable conclusion.",Dan in Real Life
265,yumicho,"Clumsy execution of a potentially better than average ""feel-good"" film",4,30 May 2013,"There were original elements to this film, but the main plot was obvious from the beginning. Viewers will know not only how ""Dan in Real Life"" not only ends, but will likely be able to figure out most of the detours within 15 minutes of the start.So much of the actual dialogue is so clichéd and poorly thought out. Without spoiling the film, Dan is meant to be a writer, but any time any of his material is introduced, it is hacky trite glurge. I rolled my eyes almost every time we were introduced to his writing. The idea that he is published, sought after, and even considered original in itself is totally unbelievable. There are elements that are original, yet these are either totally botched and the opportunity is wasted, or they are pulled off in an over the top way. At times it felt like this was trying to be a farce, at other times a quiet comedy, and at others an ensemble. I felt the family element with both Dan's nuclear and extended family was overwhelming and unbelievable. Details were sketched in, I suppose because of a lack of time and an expectation the viewer would project their own ideas about what was going on. So much is glossed over. I suspect that if this film was given proper time, or if it chose a comedy sub-genre, it would have been more enjoyable.",Dan in Real Life
266,BennyKing,Atrocious,1,20 August 2021,"I have avoided this film for years. Today, I gave it a go. It is abysmal, I wasted my time.It is not funny, it is not romantic, it is not even likable and everything in the script is so obvious that it's annoying. I really wanted to like it, as it has several actors in I really like, but in the end I hated it. It's utter garbage.This is the first film that has made me question the IMDb rating. I guessed this film scored 4.5, maybe 5.0 if all the Steve Carell fans voted without watching, 6.7??? Not a chance.",Dan in Real Life
267,sloanstorm41,Excellent movie,9,4 November 2007,"Clean family oriented movie. I laughed, I cried...I loved it. I was worried I wouldn't be able to see Steve Carrell as anything but goofy Michael from The Office. Boy, was I wrong. He should win an Oscar for his performance. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out. My husband enjoyed it and he isn't into movies of this ""type"". I saw it with 2 other couples in the 30 year old range and we all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a LONG time and certainly the cleanest. Only 1 cuss word! Not even sure why it was PG13. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, drama, romance and more!",Dan in Real Life
268,pinkpantherray,Nice Change for a romantic Comedy,10,19 March 2008,"Okay, If you have ever seen ""The Family Stone"" then its simple enough to say that this is the ""more wholesome, less political, less preachy"" version. And just simply a much better film. The story line goes:Dan (steve Carell) is a widower with three daughters who writes an advice column (Dan in Real Life). Him and his girls go to a big family get together. Early on in the story we see that his life is tough, he writes great child raising tips, yet has trouble connecting with his daughters. The first morning on the vacation he goes and gets the paper and has a ""meetcute"" with Marie (Juliette Binoche). Upon returning home to his giant family he is really excited and shares the news of his random encounter. Unfortunately for Dan, Marie is his brother's (Dane Cook) girlfriend who he invited to the family get together. The story continues to show Dan's struggle with this awkward situation and is really quite ingenious. (Stopping the story line to avoid spoilers).The movie is definitely not a ""Employee of the Month"" or ""40 year old Virgin"" comedy. It is more of a situational comedy that uses a great story to reveal the comedy in ""everyday life"" to ""oh i've been there"" situations. If you enjoy a good romantic comedy such as: ""Return to Me"", ""The Holiday"", or even something lighter such as ""Hitch"" I think you'll enjoy this movie. For my mom or others who really loved the movie ""Steel Magnolias"" i think you'll enjoy it too, just not as much! It definitely has its emotional, tears swelling up, moments! Overall, this is my favorite movie my wife has ever dragged me too!",Dan in Real Life
269,vipcs,Dan in Not So Real Life,4,28 July 2008,"I am a big fan of both Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche and was looking forward to a nice romantic comedy. Instead, I was disappointed due to a mediocre script and weak direction. Both Carell and Binoche tried their best and the movie's highlights are when they are together. This movie had a problem with working with a large on-screen cast. The ""family"" who are close-knit come across as a group of conformists - everybody sounding and acting a like. Rather than giving the family personalities it was easier to make them clones. Unfortunately, the ""family"" got in the way of the story and became more like background props and very distracting as well as annoying. The children are thrown in for tacky cuteness. It would have been more effective to focus on Carell's three daughters, his brother and the brother's girlfriend. For a better movie on big family dynamics set in New England, watch 'The Family Stone' and skip this one.",Dan in Real Life
270,jlhatter,Too precious,4,5 April 2008,"I first began watching this movie and only made it halfway through before I had to turn it off. I then resumed watching it the next day just in case it got better. It really didn't. I think of myself as having a fairly normal loving family and we have family reunions but never have we had team crossword puzzle contests, choreographed morning aerobics, or talent shows. We never had all of the aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, etc. piled into the kitchen to discuss one's love life, or lack thereof. The ""family life"" was far too constructed and in the process not very heartfelt or real. As a huge fan of Steve Carell, I was disappointed in the movie. However, I was not so disappointed in Steve, It was nice to see him out of his ""Michael Scott"" character and playing it somewhat straight. I do love Michael Scott but it is nice to see that the man definitely has range and I look forward to his next movie! It was hard to really get a grip on the other brothers and sisters. Dane Cook's brother character was the only one you really get to know in any way. The others were completely forgettable and very little substance was really brought out of them. I did like the way his daughters were played. Very good actresses and captured the essence of what it is like to be three sisters at their respective ages. Overall, it was a nice try and seemed to have good intentions but they fell very flat. Still love Steve Carell though. It's amazing how much better looking he gets when he's not playing Michael Scott!",Dan in Real Life

272,jjed888,Absolutely terrible,1,29 March 2008,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen in the last couple of years. It was marketed as one of those touching comedies. It was neither touching or comedic. I understand what the filmmakers were trying to get across. I think they were going for this: Moral Brother and Immoral Brother are in love with the same woman. Moral Brother gets girl at end. Now, that's a pretty stock plot for a movie and we've all seen a million just like it, but this was garbage. Dan's (Steve Carell and Moral Brother) shortcomings as a person were simply to glaring, almost as glaring as Mitch's (Dane Cook and Immoral Brother). He was hypocritical and, in short, should have been more moral. I was completely disgusted when, at the end, he actually ended up with AnneMarie (Juliette Binoche, Hot Chick-Lady, and Immoral Brother's girlfriend). This was CRAP!",Dan in Real Life
273,pcdurling,"Nothing special, disappointing comedy",5,18 March 2008,"I was expecting to get a chuckle or two out of the movie and I was pretty disappointed. I was unimpressed by the lead actress and I found the ""love at first sight"" very mistakable. I didn't buy their attraction to each other. I rated it a 5 based on the quality production values and message of the family shown throughout the film (except when the conflict happens). The setting was pretty good but there were a couple of characters that were under developed such as the oldest and youngest daughters who were both cute and Steve Carells character was over developed and boring as they followed him the entire movie and he was pretty uninteresting.",Dan in Real Life
274,james-farley-1,Somewhere between su- and -cks,1,19 March 2008,"This was a fairly awful experience. I thank God that we saved this for Netflix because I hate walking out on movies before I even get my root beer started much less get to finish it. Unfortunately my wife kept wanting to give this another five minutes to see if things improve because she wants Steve Carell do to well after seeing his performance in ""Little Miss Sunshine."" Watching a 45 year old man act like a fourteen year old was embarrassing at best, disengaging at worst. None of the characters were real. None of the dialog was believable or realistic. None of the human interaction were realistic or engaging. Suspension of disbelief was just too tall an order for this flick which shouldn't have been a problem since it wasn't supposed to be fantasy.One caveat - the music seemed interesting; maybe it would have been better to just film the band performing all the songs from the background.",Dan in Real Life
