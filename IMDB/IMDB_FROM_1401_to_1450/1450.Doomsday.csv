0,bkoganbing,"Scotland, a dead zone",4,19 October 2012,"Some time around 2008 some biological experiments conducted in Glasgow, Scotland went seriously awry and a virus got unleashed that annihilated Scotland. To contain the plague, the English,set up a barrier at the border like Emperor Hadrian did that marked the future boundary for England and Scotland. By 2035 it's decided that a cure if any is to be found over in what was once Scotland. Especially since satellites have detected signs of life over there. Rhona Mitra leads a team over there and the team has quite the sociological experience. In contrast to the brutal but orderly dictatorship in England, the Scots society has devolved into anarchy. Glasgow has been taken over by bands of young toughs who are into grunge and heavy metal and cannibalism. No doubt Ozzy Osborne influenced them greatly. And Malcolm McDowell has a chunk of rural Scotland that is looking like the Middle Ages.Usually science fiction has a point to make and I'm not sure what Doomsday was trying to say. Stay away from biological warfare seems the safest. An interesting film, but vague.",Doomsday
1,Leofwine_draca,"Cheesy, derivative...and huge fun",8,27 June 2016,"DOOMSDAY is one huge mess of a movie, but in a good way. Neil Marshall, the Scottish director of such low budget but entertaining fare as DOG SOLDIERS and THE DESCENT, apparently decided to make a good old-fashioned post apocalypse movie while paying tribute to his favourite movies along the way. Some might call this film a rip off of the popular '80s sci fi films, some might call it a pastiche, while others might call it a homage. For me, DOOMSDAY is original enough to be entertaining throughout, even if the story is all over the place and frequently unbelievable (even by genre stakes) and the epilogue is a damp squib compared to what's come before.For the record, this movie references THE LORD OF THE RINGS (in a strange feudal interlude, the armour is the same as that of the Orcs in Jackson's opus); GLADIATOR (there's a fierce arena battle that doesn't disappoint); ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (you can sense it in the get-in-there-and-do-the-job vibe as well as stuff like the walled-off area and streets brimming with thugs); THE WARRIORS (the punk-inspired bad guys); DISTRICT 13 (the revamped 2000s action vibe, and the film that no doubt convinced Marshall to make this); MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR (again, the punk bad guys as well as the climatic road chase) and also 28 DAYS LATER (infected zombies running amok). There are probably plenty of other references I either didn't get or didn't notice at the time.Anyway, the main reason I liked this film was because it's fun, and a whole lot of fun. Genre fans will have a ball. Marshall throws in plenty of crowd-pleasing stuff and the movie never stops moving. There's a ton of action and it's also very gory, with lots of heads being severed, as well as limbs and arterial sprays of god-knows-what. Marshall is a guy who shows a rabbit being machine-gunned for a laugh and who doesn't shy away from showing cannibalism in graphic detail, either. The cast are champions, sharing fun, hard-ass dialogue and it's great to see the likes of Bob Hoskins and Malcolm McDowell giving authority while letting the likes of Rhona Mitra and Adrian Lester have some new-found glory – Mitra and Lester are both fine, by the way. Sean Pertwee pops up yet again for an exceedingly unpleasant demise and there seems to be no end to the budget, with tons of shoot-outs, chases, explosions and more.I'm not really sure why this film gets a lot of flak, because it sets out to be a fun romp and never pretends to be anything else. It's gory, funny, action-packed and well-choreographed; I didn't find a single thing not to like, and that's great. If TAKEN and RAMBO are 2008's best serious action thrillers, then this is the tongue-in-cheek flipside of the coin.",Doomsday
2,SnoopyStyle,Mad Max in Scotland,5,23 November 2015,"In 2008, the Reaper virus spreads from Glasglow infecting Scotland. A quarantine is established and Scotland falls into darkness. In 2035, Britain is crumbling as the world avoids the country. Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) leads a raid on a cargo ship and discovers infected Scottish migrants being smuggled. The government suspects a cure for the virus has been invented and Sinclair leads a secret raid to find Dr. Marcus Kane who was working on a cure before the quarantine.This is reminiscent of better and more compelling movies like 'Escape from New York'. It tries to explain the premise but it doesn't sound believable. I can forget about all that if the movie is campy fun. Rhona Mitra's acting style is robotic although she's a very sexy tough robot. This tries to be the 'Mad Max' dystopia but it's not quite as compelling. It's got the gore and action but none of it is thrilling until the last section. This has a fun old fashion Mad Max car chase in the third act. It's filmed a little too close to the face at times. I like the camera to pull back a little and see more of the action. It's fun general mayhem. I wish the rest of the movie is at that level.",Doomsday
3,Prismark10,Two tribes,3,3 December 2017,"Doomsday is a ridiculously trashy post punk action picture set in a futuristic Britain.A deadly virus has caused chaos in Scotland. The government has erected a 12 foot steel wall along the border to separate it from the rest of the country.Now, 20 years later the virus is broken out in London and the government needs to find a cure. They know that there are survivors up in Scotland and send a unit to find someone with immunity.Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) is leading the troops, she is feisty and brave. She needs to be as Scotland is a post apocalyptic nightmare and she thinks the government who have sent her have an agenda.It is clear that writer/director Neil Marshall wears his film and musical influences on a sleeve here. There is a soundtrack harking back to the 198os. There are nods to films such as Mad Max, 28 Days Later, Escape from New York.I just think it was all a bit banal and bad. The gratuitous violence against women is off putting though.",Doomsday
4,claudio_carvalho,Highly Entertaining and Funny Action Movie,7,19 November 2009,"On 03 April 2008, an outbreak with a deadly virus called ""Reaper Virus"" begins in Glasgow and the border between England and Scotland is segregated by a long wall; however the little Scottish girl Eden succeeds in moving to London in a military helicopter. People in the quarantine zone in Scotland wait for the promised help that never comes and they are executed while trying to cross the border; the survivors live in a chaotic society and when the food ends, they eat each other. In 2035, the Reaper Virus breaks out in London and the efficient Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) is assigned by the British Government to go to Glasgow with a skilled team to seek out the scientist Dr. Marcus Kane (Malcolm McDowell) that was researching the cure for the Reaper Virus. The ambitious and powerful politician Michael Canaris (David O'Hara) discloses to the major that the satellites have recently captured images of a population in Glasgow, meaning that Dr. Kane might have succeeded in his research. However, Major Sinclair and her team find a violent society living in an environment of destruction and they have to fight to survive.""Doomsday"" is a highly entertaining and funny action movie, indeed on of the best I have recently seen. The story blends the storyline of any ""outbreak movie"", like for example, ""28 Days Later"" with ""Mad Max II or III"", ""Escape from New York"", ""Timeline"" and lots if insanity and humor. The screenplay has a non-stop action, with the excellent Rhona Mitra in the lead role of a tough military and very bad villains. The stunts are also fantastic as well as the special effects. Of course this is not the type of movie recommended for intellectuals or viewers that like only art film and it will never be nominated to the Oscar, Cannes or Berlin Festival. If you like a brainless but enjoyable action movie, disregard the bad reviews and the negative votes that I will certainly receive and give a chance to ""Doomsday"", and you may have a nice surprise in the end. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Juízo Final"" (""Doomsday"")",Doomsday
5,kosmasp,Camp,6,10 August 2008,"Your reception of the movie depends on two things. Your expectations and foremost your will to overlook a few faults/mishaps this movie does offer.But let's not start with the bad things. There is the wonderful Rhona Mitra playing the main character here and she does so, making carrying a movie looking very simple! While the other actors are mostly at least good too (for a campy movie like this), as crazy as the story is, you've seen the turns and twists before. Many things are decent, but most of all there is no great No.1 villain the movie concentrates on. In this case it does backfire a bit (for me). Again, if you can block out these thoughts, you might like the movie quite a bit more than myself.",Doomsday
6,Woodyanders,A wonderfully wild and wired futuristic sci-fi/action blast,9,19 February 2009,"2035. A lethal virus has decimated most of Glasgow, Scotland. The city has been closed off to protect London, England from the plague. When a new deadly strain of the virus threatens to infect Great Britain, the government officials send an elite team of top officers led by the extremely hard-nosed and resourceful Major Eden Sinclair (a splendidly steely portrayal by Rhona Mitra) into Glasgow to find a cure within 48 hours. The team runs afoul of both dangerous cannibal renegades and a bizarre retro Middle Ages medieval society. Writer/director Neil Marshall relates the lively and engrossing story at a constant brisk pace, maintains a properly bleak and violent tone throughout, stages the action set pieces with considerable rip-snorting gusto (the savage swordfights, bloody gunplay, and go-for-broke frenzied vehicular carnage all seriously smoke in no uncertain terms), doesn't skimp on the grisly gore (make sure to watch the unrated version), and further spices things up with a deliciously dry'n'droll sense of very British pitch-black humor. Of course, Marshall pays affectionate homage to such choice post-apocalyptic classics as ""Escape from New York"" (Sinclair has a funky mechanical eye), ""Damnation Alley,"" and the ""Mad Max"" pictures. Better still, the narrative becomes more gleefully absurd and over the top as it unfolds, with the gloriously wacky zenith reached with a decidedly sick and unwholesome arena diner party held by a rowdy urban gang of deranged flesh-eating punk lunatics led by the unhinged Sol (marvelously essayed with lip-smacking hammy aplomb by Craig Conway). The excellent cast qualifies as another substantial asset: Mitra excels as one exceptionally tough and formidable heroine, Conway lets it all hang out as Sol, Lee-Anne Liebenberg impresses as Sol's fierce warrior woman main squeeze Viper, plus there are sturdy supporting turns by Bob Hoskins as Sinclair's wise, no-nonsense superior Bill Nelson, Adrian Lester as rugged Sergeant Norton, David O'Hara as ruthless, slippery diplomat Michael Canaris, Malcom McDowell as crazed scientist Dr. Marcus Kane, MyAnna Buring as Kane's feisty wayward daughter Cally, and Alexander Siddig as pompous prime minister John Hatcher. Kudos are also in order for Sam McCurdy's slick, stunning cinematography, the first-rate special effects, Tyler Bates' ominous, pulsating score, and the lavish production design. A real exciting, energetic, and above all hugely entertaining pip.",Doomsday
7,ma-cortes,A futuristic movie full of kinetic energy and amazing stunt work,6,22 August 2009,"This thunderous picture begins in Great Britain, 2007 . A deadly virus spreads causing hundreds of thousands infecting . The government evacuates people and builds an impregnable wall along with the Wall of Adriano, impeding the access . London, 2035 recent time, the reaper virus breaks out again. Then , various authorities, P.M (Alexander Siddig) and Canaris(David O'Hara)decide to send a specialists team. Nelson(Bob Hoskins) assigns the dangerous mission to Major Eden (Rhona Mitra).

In the near-future Glascow city, they'll have to fight against cutthroats, a band of depraved crazies thirsty for blood and survive some battles to-the-death.This exciting movie is packed with noisy action, unbelievable car stunts, tension, thrills, chills, and lots of blood and gore, including throating-slit ,beheading, impaling and cannibalism. The story is a blend of classic Sci-Fi movies as ¨Escape from N.Y.¨, ¨27 Days/Weeks later¨ and of course ¨Mad Max¨, taking parts here and there. Thrilling musical score fitting to action by Tyler Bates. Colorful cinematography reflecting splendidly the Scotland outdoors in which resides the Doctor Kane and where he has built a medieval world. The motion picture is well directed by Neal Marshall (Descent, Dog soldiers) but with no originally because he has copied previous films. This remarkable action film appeal to science fiction buffs",Doomsday
8,BA_Harrison,"Neil Marshall undoubtedly had fun with Doomsday. The question is, will you?",7,12 May 2008,"When I first heard about Doomsday, I was very excited: Director Neil Marshall had already made two of my favourite horror films of recent yearsDog Soldiers and The Descentand I was sure that he possessed the talent to successfully deliver a perfect platter of UK-based post-apocalyptic mayhem.Unfortunately, rather than making a serious (and original) attempt at filming Britain's answer to Mad Max and Escape From New York, Marshall has opted to deliver a deliberately camp exercise in self-indulgent excess: a big, dumb, gory, and gleefully OTT homage to his favourite post-apocalyptic movies. Whilst it's undeniably a 'fun' movie, Doomsday is a far cry from being the end-of-the-world action masterpiece that I had hoped it would be.The story, which borrows heavily from several genre classics, sees a deadly virus sweeping across Scotland, forcing the British government to seal off the infected area (via a huge metal barrier) in order to prevent the disease spreading to the rest of the UK. Years later and those people abandoned behind the wall are presumed dead and the virus is consigned to the history books.Then, much to the government's horror, the virus makes a comebackthis time in London. However, all hope is not lost: satellite photography shows that there are still survivors in the quarantine zone and a team of soldiers, lead by sexy Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra), is sent in to see if a possible cure can be locateda job made extremely difficult by the gang of cannibalistic punks that now controls the area.Just as many bands struggle creatively with their third album, so it seems to me that Neil Marshall has suffered from 'difficult third movie' syndrome, where a combination of a bigger budget and the pressure to perform has led the talented director to temporarily lose sight of his primary objective: to tell a decent story.To many, it will appear that Marshall has developed this movie 'arse about face'. In other words, rather than starting with a solid plot and then working on the visuals, he has taken a collection of 'cool' ideas inspired by his favourite movies and attempted to mould a story around them, the result being nothing more than a series of spectacular special effects, impressive stunts, and (admittedly) exciting set-pieces that unfortunately fail to gel together to form a satisfying whole.One thing is for sureaudiences wishing to get the most from Doomsday should approach the film with a willingness to relax and go with the flow, because dissecting the story, examining the plot holes and questioning the film's logic will only lead to disappointment.6.5 out of 10, generously rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",Doomsday
9,Quinoa1984,...Neil Marshall made this?,4,14 March 2008,"It seemed a little circumspect from the outset that Doomsday could be a disappointment. Despite a trailer that looked kind of 'rad', mostly for its wild bits of action and throwbacks to Mad Max and Escape from New York, it was not screened for any critics. For most horror or other genre features I could understand. But Neil Marshall? This was the same man who provided us with the Descent, one of the great horror films of the past decade (I have yet to see Dog Soldiers, his Scottish werewolf movie). There must have been some mistake.No mistake. Doomsday, which is a quasi post-apocalyptic thriller, is more Sci-fi channel movie-of-the-week than 28 Years Later. The basic gist of the plot, for those interested, is that a virus spreads throughout most of Britain, and the higher-ups block off half of the country with a gigantic wall, leaving those with the virus to fend for themselves. Many years pass, but on the 'clean' side there's a problem- the virus has come back, and the prime minister brings in a top elite soldier-with-a-pop-out-camera-eye Edie Sinclair (Rhona Mitra), to lead a task force to go over the wall, get the cure, and bring it back before it's too late.Fair enough. But Marshall reveals, as the film goes along, that he doesn't take much of this seriously, at all. Far from it, I would bestow upon Doomsday what I've now recently dubbed the ""Ghost Rider award"" (in honor of last year's magnum opus with Nicolas Cage, NOT as Fu Manchu unfortunately), for being incredibly, ridiculously crafted, but not having a bone in its body that really works like an actual genre film should. You'll laugh, and laugh some more, as Sinclair and her team are captured by the savages living in the seemingly abandoned cities, who put on wild musical numbers to Fine Young Cannibals music (ho-ho) and look like rejects from Miller's iconic movies.But even some of this stuff, with its frenetic action and pace- and Marshall's editing, which I'm not sure is done via pressure from the studios or just trying to one-up Paul WS Anderson- and the sheer magnitude of crazy sci-fi atmosphere, comes off like it's out of a fever dream that Marshall had after a night of binging on 80s genre flicks. That is *some* of this stuff. It goes without saying that by the time our sort-of hero meets the medieval (like Middle Age England) hold-up of Malcolm McDowell's Kane, we just give up thinking that it's entertaining aside from the 'so-stupid-it's-beautiful' sense.But if there's any sin that Marshall does commit with his action and other sequences, more often than not (and I say more often than not as there is a car chase Ala Road Warrior climax that ranks with some of the most uproariously delirious footage I've seen in a while), is that he doesn't craft them for maximum impact. With the excluding factor of the blood-lust, including lots of limbs and heads dismembered, the blood that there is in buckets, it's shot and edited at times that you can't even really see what the hell is going on, as though if you blink you'll miss most of a fight scene or beheading.Combining this with enough illogical steps to fill a small canyon, and some lackluster star power (David O'Hara, who was great as the deadpan Fitzy in the Departed, is a cold fish as a power-hungry tyrant in a business suit), and cinematography that comes straight out of glossy car commercials, Doomsday is a disappointment, with the only encouragement being that now that this is out of his system maybe he can make another fantastic film next go-around.",Doomsday
10,Coventry,Fancy a trip to the beautiful Scottish Highlands?,9,1 April 2008,"Neil Marshall, the multi-talented British director who previously made the gory but nevertheless tasteful ""Dog Soldiers"" and ""The Descent"", surprises and primarily pleases his fan-base audiences with this mega-outrageous, campy and tasteless SciFi-horror-action hybrid that is simply destined to become a cult classic within the next couple of years already. I was lucky enough to see the film during a national film festival, where Neil Marshall was at guest himself to single-handedly present his film to anxious Belgian genre fans. Marshall described his own film in only a few words, but it was much better than any film-critic could ever do it in his place. He openly admitted that ""Doomsday"" is principally a direct love letter to all the movies he grew up with and that he deliberately stuffed the screenplay with numerous tributes and hidden references towards the paranoid and apocalyptic Sci-Fi (road-) movies of the early 80's. It only requires a glimpse at the screen and you immediately know Marshall is right. ""Doomsday"" catapults you straight back to the glorious days of cheesy exploitation where literally everything was possible and plot-logic and coherence weren't necessities. The two main inspirations for the film are obviously ""Mad Max"" and ""Escape from N.Y."", but talking in terms of absurd plot twists, OTT set pieces and flamboyant costume designs, uncompromising gore, deliberately bad acting performances and insane character drawings, ""Doomsday"" is actually far more reminiscent to the (mainly Italian) rip-off industry of that time. Apart from the aforementioned and acclaimed landmarks, I also recognized bits and pieces  though I may be mistaken of course - of far more obscure titles like ""The Atlantis Interceptors"", ""After the Fall of New York"", ""2033: The New Gladiators"", ""The Bronx Warriors"", ""Warriors of the Wasteland"" and countless of others.In 2008, there's a sudden outbreak of the unstoppable and incurable ""Reaper Virus in Glasgow. In order to prevent further spreading, the British government simply decides to build a wall all around Scotland and leave everyone within the borders to die a slow and painful death. Almost twenty years later, in 2035, the feared Virus returns and threatens to rapidly extinct the entire population of London. The Prime Minister and his corrupt as hell right hand Canaris send the fearless Special Agent Eden Sinclair to Scotland to search for a remedy. Because there definitely are survivors in Scotland; the government just decided to keep it secret. When entering the area with her troops, Eden almost immediately runs into large clusters of survivors that reverted to primitive and barbaric life-styles. Their search for the virus' cure quickly turns into a vile battle to stay alive. ""Doomsday"" is simply Fan-Tas-Tic entertainment and it's undoubtedly the greatest trash-film of the past two decades. The plot stops to make sense quite early in the film and has more holes than the average fishing net. The narrative is also wildly incoherent and even the tiniest plot twist and line of dialog is stolen from another film. But, seriously, who cares about all that when a movie is this much fun! ""Doomsday"" is extremely violent, with unhinged footage of anarchy and even a throwback to the Roman times in the arena, but simultaneously hilarious, with the craziest characters imaginable and even a soundtrack featuring golden eighties bands like The Fine Young Cannibals and Franky Goes to Hollywood. The campy highlights in ""Doomsday"" are literally too numerous to list, but I assure it has everything any fan of B-movies could ever dream of. I hate to sound obnoxious and/or pretend all knowing, but all those people claiming ""Doomsday"" is a pointlessly stupid film either missed the whole point or simply don't fit within Neil Marshall's target group and thus shouldn't criticize.",Doomsday
11,hitchcockthelegend,"In the land of the infected, the immune man is king.",8,20 September 2010,"Doomsday is written & directed by Neil Marshall and stars Rhona Mitra, Bob Hoskins, Malcolm McDowell, Alexander Siddig, David O'Hara, Craig Conway, Adrian Lester, Darren Morfitt & Sean Pertwee.2008 and the deadly Reaper virus has run amok in the north of the United Kingdom. Desperate to contain and stop the spread of the disease, the powers that be erect a high security wall to separate Scotland from the rest of civilisation. Cut to 2035 and the virus has started to surface in overcrowded London. Word has it that there are survivors of the virus still in the ""Hot Zone"" of Scotland and medical researcher Dr. Kane (McDowell) may have found the cure. So needing someone to go into the ""Hot Zone"" to locate Kane, the politico's ask head of the Department of Security Captain Nelson (Hoskins) to send his best operative in with a crack team to seek and bring home. That best person for the job turns out to be a woman, Eden Sinclair, a child evacuee from Scotland when the virus broke. Once inside, Sinclair and her team find a world gone berserk, where gangs of cannibals rule the streets and violence is the order of the day. The chances of getting out alive, never mind finding Kane, appear remote at best.By the time Neil Marshall started making Doomsday it was widely known that after Dog Soldiers & The Descent he is not someone to hide his influences. A 70s & 80s horror/sci-fi lover thru and thru, the next step for him would be to make a homage movie befitting his keenness for schlocky cinema. And so it proved, where armed with a £17 million budget afforded him by Universal Pictures, Marshall has made an outrageously fun and violent apocalyptic movie. It would take up too much time to name every movie homaged by Marshall, but primarily we can call it a blend of Escape From New York & the Mad Max movies, with any killer plague movie thrown into the mix too.Doomsday has many problems. Its box office failure and low rating on the big internet movie sites suggests that to be the case. Some will point to the over cramming of homages, or some iffy acting, while others dissect the plot holes and cringe at the sloppy editing that appears from time to time. Even some of the dialogue (rightly) comes in for a bit of a kicking and characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is still a special movie, one for those of a similar persuasion to Marshall's cinema viewing peccadilloes. It's not like Marshall was bullish from the outset about his movie being a critical darling, he said on completion of the shoot that it was sure to be a most divisive movie. But he also knew that it will find fans, and so it has proved.Doomsday comes complete with mindless violence, blood letting on tap, OTT performances, blistering stunt work (non CG), adrenalin pumping set pieces, gratuitous swearing and a kick ass soundtrack to boot. Its production value is also very high, be it the costuming (S&M punks and medieval knights) or the location shooting in Scotland & South Africa, Marshall uses the money well as he attacks his movie with admirable gusto. There's a lot going on for sure, with plenty of surprises along the way. This is not a telegraphed from a mile away sequence of events, it's a well put together action story, one that is effective as a grimy and grisly Britsploitation piece. Don't try to add it all up, just enjoy the fun as it unspools. You get the feeling that some of the harsher critics of the film were taking it just a little bit too seriously.Mitra is fine and spunky, a lad mag dream come true. A heroine who kicks ass, drives a sports car like it's a tank and often lets her nipples and buttocks do the talking! McDowell chews the scenery like tomorrow may never come, Conway steals every scene he is in as the deranged cannibal leader, while Hoskins & O'Hara (what a voice) add a touch of professionalism in amongst the Grindhouse like mayhem. Soundtrack features Adam & The Ants, Siouxsie & The Banshees, Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Kasabian & (unsurprisingly) Fine Young Cannibals, the latter of which is used to host a bizarre, yet mirth inducing, sequence that also serves as a prelude to something appropriately gross.If you be a like minded adult like Neil Marshall and myself then this has to be a winner. It's not Marshall's best film by a long shot, it is however his most fun and most bold. How can you not get a kick out of watching Mitra lop off heads and drive a car thru a bus? Or admire how you have been coerced into giggling as a rabbit is blown to smithereens (Peckinpah would have been proud). For the stunt work alone the film deserves an 8/10 from genre fans, as it is, for those not inclined towards apocalypto mania, that will be 5/10 then. Hopefully this delicious piece of schlocky pie will find more like minded fans to enjoy it for what it is.",Doomsday
12,Theo Robertson,"Unoriginal , Bizarre But Watchable Post Apocalyptic Thriller",6,5 January 2010,"I remember both DOG SOLDIERS and THE DESCENT , two very different horror movies in both tone and feel . I wondered how writer/director would follow up on this . DOOMSDAY came along and got slaughtered by the critics and bombed at the box office so I made no attempt to see it until it came along on Sky movies recently . Whilst the critics are right to a certain degree it's nowhere bad as some of them claimed . It's certainly far from a masterpiece of course but is far more enjoyable than I was expecting Where the critics are correct is the "" Every post apocalyptic movie you've ever seen in your life plot "" There's the basic premise of 28 DAYS/WEEKS LATER , DEF CON 4 and MAD MAX along with nods to ALIENS and TOMB RAIDER . This isn't enough to condemn the film and is often entertaining . Indeed watching the first 15 minutes as survivors try to to storm the barricades is both impressive and bleak and the scene I remember is a couple of survivors triggering mines whilst a third is killed by an army sniper Unfortunately where the film falls down is the horrendous lack of logic to much of the storyline . Just how quickly can barricades be erected to contain the infected ? Aren't there any farmers left alive to grow crops and herd cattle ? In fact cattle are shown so why do people become cannibals ? There's also countless scenes where petrol bombs are thrown but this contrasts with countless scenes where the Scottish society is very much medieval with no means of technology , so where'd they get they get the petrol for Molotov cocktails and cars ? Not to be too critical DOOMSDAY is a highly watchable movie , maybe down to the fact that it's not too camp . Agreed you'll have to turn off your brain for most of it to work but there's enough gory action on screen to keep you entertained . In short it's very much a bizarre B movie",Doomsday
13,Scarecrow-88,Doomsday,8,17 January 2009,"The Reaper virus devastated a portion of Scotland with England building a steel, reinforced barrier splitting apart Great Britain. With signs of the Reaper virus reawakening in London, and the photographic evidence of those who have survived on the opposite side, quarantined away from ""civilization"", the British government(..or what's left of it)desires for a commando unit, led by someone of great skill and leadership(..able enough to pull off such a difficult, seemingly impossible feat), to find the cure which has allowed those uninfected to survive where the Reaper virus had ran rampant. Selected to lead the team is one-eyed Major Eden Sinclair(Rhona Mitra), a skilled marksman with no fear, always calculating her next move, with an ability to handle chaos when others might falter. She is seen at the opening as the little girl whose eye was shot by a soldier with a hair trigger and is sent away by her mother on board a helicopter to safety as the madness of frightened citizens seeking refuge from being quarantined are all around her. Eden wears a high-tech eye which works as a video recording device and camera. She also has a watch which feeds her information from the eye. The soldiers under her wear the typically black hi-tech gear and carry the elaborate rifles able to blast the enemy with range and precision. They enter the quarantined Scotland inside armored tank-vehicles with security cameras and weaponry equipped to handle an army of marauders and savages as the case will soon become. They encounter a society of leather-clad, immoral cannibalistic, barbaric punks with mohawks, facial make-up, and piercings, a direct representation of a world gone terribly wrong it seems. They seem to have a singular mission, to harm and destroy, and those who decide to infiltrate ""their city"" are slaughtered. Eden and her commandos(..or those left after the savages pick them apart)are to find a Doctor Marcus Kane(Malcolm McDowell, whose chilling narration opens the film, informing the viewers of the horrifying future as it unfolded before the true plot forges ahead)who was working on a cure before murder and mayhem arises having him flee with men elsewhere. Kane's son, Sol(Craig Conway, letting it hall hang out), is the psychotic leader of his fanatical army, actually holding his decent and scared sister, Cally(MyAnna Buring) prisoner, planning much worse for Eden. Cally knows where Kane is and will lead Eden to his location. What lies in wait for Eden is a now diabolically mad Kane, who has built a new life for himself and those who followed him out of Sol's city, living within the confines of a medieval castle fortress, adopting a new type of civilization away from the past, isolated from the memories of yore, building an empire which threatens anyone from the other side.Obviously director Neil Marshall was inspired by his beloved influences, creating a wonderfully wicked hodgepodge of Escape from New York, The Road Warrior and 28 Days Later.. This will be considered a travesty by some, ripping off films from the past, but I saw it differently, working more as a homage, gloriously embedding the viewer into a harsh climate of violence and despair, a grim post-apocalyptic nightmare where all hope seems lost and only the mad or infinitely corrupt survive. Eden is a symbol of strength, fortitude, smarts, and cool..a charismatic and formidable opponent towards those who wish nothing but hostility and death towards those they consider responsible for the pitiful conditions brought on by circumstances out of control. Those abandoned and left for dead cry out by inflicting misery on outsiders who pose a threat to their way of life and purpose. Featuring a Reaper virus quite similar to the one released by the monkey in 28 Days Later.. Eden is a female equivalent of Snake Plisskin, even missing an eye and wearing a patch(..and has a locater device which is smashed to pieces not longer after entering the quarantined zone) And Sol's punks are very reminiscent to the violent freaks and weirdos from The Road Warrior. There's something quite surreal about seeing an action heroine facing off with a vicious punk one moment, and a massive soldier in gladiatorial combat within a suit of armour, not long after. One moment freaks on motorcycles and a graffiti-covered beat-up bus(hearkening back to Hill's The Warriors) are after Eden, the next Kane's men on horseback with a suit of armour,swords in hand, with archers equipped with a bow and arrows. Then the masterfully designed chase on the open roads as Sol's gang(..in modified vehicles featuring their deranged style) are after Eden and company(..driving a Bentley they found in an abandoned warehouse)featuring bristling scenes where crashes are imminent, across a gorgeous picturesque countryside with winding roads. Bashed in heads, a bunny rabbit blown to bits by an automatic machine gun, a victim cooked over an open fire as Sol's people celebrate a cannibalistic feast, imaginative beheadings galore..lots of ultra-violence in store for those who crave such things. Marshall adopts modern techniques which might repel many..quick cuts and breathlessly paced camera work are featured during the action sequences whether it be hand-to-hand combat or cars crashing into each other. Solid cast featuring Bob Hoskins as Eden's guiding influence Bill Nelson bringing his usual commanding presence to the film in an almost thankless role, Alexander Siddig as the Prime Minister, a rather spineless leader for a nation who has been abandoned by the other parts of the world, and David O'Hara as Canaris, the cold-blooded lieutenant who truly calls the shots, using his boss as a tool, just waiting to take his place. Great role for Mitra who conveys confidence and quiet swagger, also having the precise look needed to fulfill the role demanded of her. The Reaper virus is a nasty plague where humans' faces are bombarded with hideous sores and cause the hemorrhaging of blood.",Doomsday
14,poolandrews,Enjoyable enough sci-fi action horror.,6,13 May 2011,"Doomsday starts in 2008 in Glasgow in England where the Reaper virus quickly spreads infecting & killing thousands. The British Government orders the whole of Scotland to be quarantined, a huge thirty foot high metal wall is build that completely surrounds Scotland. Anyone trying to leave Scotland is instantly shot dead in an effort to contain the deadly Reaper virus. Nearly thirty years later during 2035 the Reaper virus unexpectedly resurfaces in London, the British Government panics & hastily sets up an elite team to enter Scotland & find a potential cure as signs of human life have been detected for over three years. Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) is chosen to lead a team of soldiers & scientists into Scotland & find research scientist Dr Marcus Kane (Malcolm McDowell) who was working on a cure for the virus when Scotland was quarantined. However gangs of vicious thugs & a hatred of the outside world makes their task very difficult...This English, American, South African & German co-production was written,edited & directed by Neil Marshall who is one of the more worthwhile names to look out for the genre of horror over the past decade or so after making the excellent Dog Soldiers (2002) & The Descent (2005) before Doomsday which was his third film & while not as good as his previous two Doomsday is still an enjoyable ride. The script clearly has lots of influences from Escape from New York (1981) with it's walled in city & urgent mission to retrieve something of great importance, the entire scene of the heavily armed soldiers in an APC infiltrating Glasgow & being picked off one-by-one is modelled after a similar sequence in Aliens(1986) while the lawless gang of villains & the final car chase across an open plain was surely inspired by similar themes & scenes in Mad Max 2 (1981). The script is a mix of ideas & genres from horror to sci-fi to action to political thriller to historical adventure to post apocalyptic to comedy in a real oddball concoction that does actually just about work & is surprisingly enjoyable at the same time. The one main problem with Doomsday is that with so many different influences & so much going on both visually & thematically the film is a little uneven with various parts of the story being forgotten or ignored for large periods while other seemingly random elements are introduced, for instance once the team enter Scotland the Reaper virus outbreak in London is all but forgotten for the next hour or so. Also at just under two hours long maybe it runs out of steam a little towards the end, however overall Doomsday is a fun mix of influences & homages that is well worth a watch but maybe just stops short of being brilliant.There are some good fights & gore scenes here, from cut off hands & heads to people burned alive to someone squashed under the wheels of a vehicle (another nod to Aliens) heads blown off with shotguns to diseased people to Rabbits being shot to pieces to Cows being run over & there's plenty of blood splatter too. There are some great moments & visual gags, from the Knight in armour to the scenes at the Castle with a 'Gift Shop' plaque clearly visible in the background to some great car stunts at the end. The whole look & feel of Doomsday is all over the place, from period historical with medieval settings & steam trains to future desolate post apocalyptic wasteland settings to a very futuristic feel at times with various weapons & equipment seen at least something is always happening in a wide variety of settings.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 this has very good production values & actually looks very nice, mainly shot in South Africa with other location work in Scotland & London. The acting is pretty good, no-one seems to be taking things too seriously & leading lady Rhona Mitra is very nice to look at.Doomsday is a strange mix of other films & ideas that is rather entertaining in it's own right, it's not the greatest film ever made but it will pass a couple of hours harmlessly enough. I liked it.",Doomsday
15,dbborroughs,How much you enjoy this will depend on how much you feel you've seen it all before,5,30 March 2008,"In April 2008 a virus begins a deadly reign in Scotland. In order to prevent the spread Scotland is walled off from the rest of the world and the population allowed to die. When the plague breaks out 30 years later in London a team of soldiers is sent into the walled country in the hopes of finding a cure that has allowed some people to survive. Once inside the wall the team finds itself under siege and things are not what wholly what they seem.Well made action scifi film that should have been one of the best films of the year. the problem with the film is that it borrows chapter and verse from films like Escape from New York, The Mad Max films, 28 Day Later, Damnation Alley, Romero Zombie films and numerous other apocalyptic films. When I mean chapter and verse I mean I was watching sequences and saying this bit is like Mad Max, this bit is like Road Warrior, this is like Escape From New York, this bit... The wholesale borrowing detracted from the enjoyment for me since I couldn't lose myself in the action on screen. There is nothing wrong with either a film paying homage to earlier films, or not breaking new ground and just being a balls to the wall action film, there is however trouble with film borrowing so much that appears to be little more than a clip reel. Okay its not that bad but it is bad enough to be distracting.Does this mean that the film isn't worth seeing? No. As to whether you'll want to do so on the big screen is going to be your call since the action is quite good, the question is going to rest on whether you want to see something that you may have seen before-elsewhere.5 out of 10 since your mileage may vary...",Doomsday
16,Bunuel1976,"DOOMSDAY (Neil Marshall, 2008) **1/2",6,31 October 2008,"I had been reasonably impressed by both of director Marshall's previous horror efforts  DOG SOLDIERS (2002) and THE DESCENT (2005); this isn't up to their standards, but it's not too bad if taken on its own terms. That said, the film relies all-too-lazily on previous sci-fi 'classics' for its plot and look  chiefly ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (1981) and the ""Mad Max"" franchise. Even so, the clash between the futuristic and the medieval during its latter stages works surprisingly well.Similarly, Rhona Mitra is effective in the role of the one-eyed badass heroine (despite the fact that Marshall's would-be cool one-liners aren't exactly memorable or inspired); the rest of the cast includes veterans Bob Hoskins as a tough, foul-mouthed but sympathetic cop and Malcolm McDowell as the doctor who turned his back on country and profession in the face of a virus which has decimated Scotland and is threatening Britain (curiously enough, though, he's pretty much forgotten by the end!). As expected, the film offers tons of action and gore at the expense of logic and characterization: its notion that cannibalistic punk rockers will prevail during the Apocalypse isn't quite the type of dehumanization envisaged by George Orwell  but, after all, this is far more a no-holds-barred action flick than it is a socially-conscious political allegory.Unsurprisingly, too, the long sought-after cure emerges to be nothing more remarkable than the immune blood system of a survivor (McDowell's own daughter, while his son is  just as predictably  the rebellious leader of the punks)! Thankfully, for all its grime and inherent bleakness, the film generally takes a blackly comedic attitude  so that a moment as the one in which a punk riding a motorbike falls on his head and breaks his neck comes across as hilarious because one of those infiltrators he's chasing (a member of the heroine's band) stops his flight long enough to cringe at such a painful demise!",Doomsday
17,zardoz-13,"The Best British Import Since the ""Underworld"" Series!",8,20 March 2008,"In the exciting new British science fiction shoot'em up ""Doomsday,"" writer & director Neil Marshall of ""The Descent"" pays tribute to some of the best post-apocalyptic thrillers from the 1970s and the 1980s. This inventive actioneer lives up to its R-rating with blood-splattered, grindhouse gore galore and audacious high octane heroics that will have you standing on your hind legs and howling for more.The set-up for ""Doomsday"" draws on John Carpenter's classic ""Escape from New York"" with Kurt Russell. Marshall turns the hero into a heroine with ""Number 23"" actress Rhona Mitra playing a Teflon-tough cop. Like Russell's one-eyed Snake Plissken, Mitra's heroic Major Eden Sinclair is shy one eye, too. The difference is the British Department of Domestic Security has replaced her missing eye with a ping-pong ball sized prosthetic orb that can be removed from her socket and rolled around corners. Activating a ultra-slick Dick Tracy style wristwatch, Eden can see what the indestructible eyeball records on a disc in the watch. Like Snake Plissken, Eden wears a form-fitting black outfit and can shoot the ears off her opponents with single shots. Eden's other plus is that she doesn't stop and drool as one of her less fortunate fellow officers when he gapes at a naked babe rising from a bath tub with a pump action shotgun in her fists.Anyway, a virus called 'the Reaper' breaks out in Scotland, and the British erect a new version of Hadrian's Wall. The wall sports a state-of-the-art surveillance system with a remote control arsenal of machine guns. The virus infects Glasgow and people die left and right as their faces erupt with ghoulish pustules. Katherine Sinclair (Emma Cleasby of ""Dog Soldiers"") desperately wants to get her young daughter Eden (Christine Tomlinson) safely out of Scotland. Before she can bundle Eden aboard a military helicopter, her daughter loses her eye in a deadly shoot-out brought on by a frightened British riot control trooper. Katherine doesn't survive the slaughter, but she sees her daughter fly to safety. Afterward, British authorities seal the wall between Scotland and Britain, impose a quarantine, and nobody crosses the border alive again.""Doomsday"" leaps to the year 2035. Eden is now one of the best D.D.S. agents in the field. U.K. military satellites provide alarming images of survivors in the quarantine zone, and Prime Minister John Hatcher (Alexander Siddig of ""Syriana"") and Michael Canaris (David O'Hara of ""The Departed"") wonder if the survivors have concocted a cure. As sensational as the satellite photos are, these high-ranking Brits are doubly concerned because the virus has migrated now to Britain. They need a serum soon or the rest of the British Isles is doomed. Hatcher and Canaris mount a suicidal mission to find the cure. Top British cop Bill Nelson (Bob Hoskins of ""Unleashed"") taps Major Sinclair to take charge of the mission. A scientist, Dr. Talbot (Sean Pertwee of ""Event Horizon""), accompanies the D.D.S., and officials secretly open the wall for them to cross over. Since neither Hatcher nor Canaris want to fuel speculation, they send Sinclair and company in on the ground rather than violate a decade's old 'no fly zone' to dispatch them.Our heroes are shocked by their reception in Glasgow. Indeed, survivors do exist. These survivors are wild-eyed, psychotic cannibals that must have watched the Mel Gibson ""Mad Max"" sequel ""The Road Warrior"" because they dress like punk rockers from Perdition. They destroy the two armored carriers hauling our heroes, and they barbecue poor Talbot alive and then serve him to the crowd. The chief villain Sol (Craig Conway of ""Dog Soldiers"") lets Sinclair live. Sol wants to use her as a ruse to fool the D.D.S. and spearhead a British invasion. Catching Sinclair and keeping this brawny babe in chains is something not even Sol can do. Sinclair escapes, assembles her surviving soldiers, and they plunge into the forests, only to come face-to-face with army of horsemen straight out of ""Excalibur"" suited up in armor with swords and lances.Although you've seen what happens here before in several vintage sci-fi films, Marshall takes these blasts from the past and revitalizes them with his own brand of adrenalin-laced hysteria. ""Doomsday"" ranks as the best butt-kicking action melodrama that the U.K. has exported since the ""Underworld"" movies with Kate Beckinsale. Not surprising, slim, sexy action starlet Rhona Mitra who toplines ""Doomsday"" has been cast in the third ""Underworld: The Rise of the Lycans"" due out in 2009.",Doomsday

19,view_and_review,Bad Bentley Commercial,5,28 October 2021,"""Doomsday"" was part ""Resident Evil,"" part ""28 Days Later,"" with a little bit of ""Mad Max"" and other movies. In other words, it was all over the place.The start was brutally good. Scotland has been overrun by an infectious and very deadly disease and the UK military is shooting down citizens trying to keep them hemmed in while they seal close the last solid metal gate to keep the infected out of the rest of the UK. It's a wall that would make any U. S. Republican jealous. The movie fast forwards 27 years and kind of morphs into a rehash of ""Resident Evil"" with a kickass heroine and a specified mission in a zone that was cordoned off and full of infected people.The Ripa Virus appeared in London. The Prime Minister, John Hatcher (Alexander Siddig), then revealed to one of his staff that he knew of survivors in Scotland and if they could get one they could use him/her for a cure. That's when Bill Nelson (Bob Hoskins) tapped our heroine Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) on the shoulder to do the job. She and her team had 48 hours to extract a survivor to help stop the spread of the virus in London.Once Eden and her team got into Scotland they found all kinds of crazies and that's when the movie started to derail. From that point on it was a mixed bag of yelling and violence. There were a couple of righteous kills in there, but not enough to carry the entire movie.Then there was the bad Bentley commercial. Bentley's are high-end super cars. Why couldn't Eden outrun a standard, well-used, Scottish police vehicle--not to mention the other makeshift vehicles she failed to escape? They threw the Bentley in there for the coolness factor, but all it had was looks. It may as well had been a Honda Civic.",Doomsday

With fountains of blood.This film was made by Neil Marshall, he who made Dog Soldiers and The Descent. Well, Dog Soldiers was fun, and The Descent was all style and no sense, but both of them were full of bad language and blood. So no complaining that there was no warning about what was coming up.This movie was not a deeply profound discourse on the human condition. It was a couple of hours of lowest common denominator, highly kinetic, popcorn action movie involving a search for a plague cure in the feral wastes of Scotland. Rhona Mitra makes a decent enough action heroine, albeit one who is not called upon to emote very much. The whole thing is dark and bleached - even the daytime scenes have a washed out look to them. There is undoubtedly a certain visual style to it.You don't get cannibal sequences very often in movies (particularly the cooking part!) but you've got one here! Malcolm McDowell is wasted. And I'm not too sure what Bob Hoskins was up to, accent-wise.The dialogue in the early part of the movie is positively dreadful.Oh, and the sound was incredibly loud. I thought they'd toned that back in movies nowadays, but this was absolutely, and unnecessarily, ear-splitting.But I kind of enjoyed it in an undemanding way. Knowing what I was in for beforehand meant I wasn't disappointed.",Doomsday
21,Uriah43,Very Intriguing,6,1 November 2012,"A new epidemic called the ""Reaper Virus"" has started in Scotland and it is killing people by the thousands with no cure available. To stem the onslaught of this terrible disease the entire country of Scotland is sealed off from the rest of Great Britain by a huge steel wall. Those left behind in the ""infected zone"" are left to die a horrible fate. Anarchy soon takes over, followed by riots which cause even more death and savagery. With food supplies gone the remaining survivors resort to cannibalism. Meanwhile, things in London (and other parts of Great Britain) deteriorate as well. Having witnessed the cruel and callous nature of its leadership, Great Britain becomes a pariah nation and is isolated from the rest of the world. Packed with desperate people who have managed to survive the plague, but have lost everything in the process, poverty and homelessness result for much of the population. After 37 years in abysmal conditions, the Reaper Virus returns--in London. Desperate for a cure the government decides to send a special team led by ""Major Eden Sinclair"" (Rhona Mitra) into Scotland to look for notes by a doctor named ""Kane"" (Malcolm McDowell). They have 48 hours to bring back a cure. Anyway, that's the basic initial outline of the movie and I will leave the rest of the plot alone for those who might wish to see it without any spoilers. Having said that, I would like to add that I thought Rhona Mitra gave an outstanding performance throughout the entire film. I also liked Adrian Lester in the role of ""Sergeant Norton"" and Craig Conway as ""Sol"", the psychotic leader of the cannibal punks. But I think the most intriguing performance was turned in by Lee-Anne Liebenberg as Sol's girlfriend, ""Viper"". Very intriguing indeed. Anyway, I thought the film was outstanding as long as it was in a dark urban environment. But it really seemed to go downhill fast once it shifted to a medieval setting. The differences were just too stark and it didn't seem to fit this picture at all. But then, maybe a person has to be British to appreciate something like this. Be that as it may, I enjoyed the movie (for the most part) and I think those who favor lots of action will like it as well.",Doomsday

Then a small armed group ventures into danger to find a cure resulting in images of graphic torture and pure nonsense. Asides from special effects director Neil Marshall does his best with every zombie cliché within reach. Only Rhona Mitra seems interesting given her background and separation from her mother. She now leads the mission in true hard core fashion hacking and slashing through whomever or whatever gets in the way. She is the one stronghold the film has. Bob Hoskins was terrific in Who Framed Roger Rabbit but here he more or less sleepwalks through the entire film. Adrian Lester is subdued in cardboard writing. Malcolm McDowell is playing another useless villain that certainly isn't up to his work in A Clockwork Orange. Alexander Siddig plays the Prime Minister but nothing this role contributes offers anything of value to this piece of trash.

The most blatant one is Escape From New York, which basically has the same plot and the same tropes.Some may say that Marshall has ripped off these movies, but if you look closer this is a loving homage to someone who grew up watching these sort of movies and just losing themselves in their world.It's fun, a lot of guilty fun, but if you really look deeper, there are lots and lots of plot holes, so its best just to appreciate the film for what it is, an exploitation homage to some very cool classics.The cast are okay, and Mitra does good, but she is outshone by the wealth of bad guys and some good support from Hoskins and Pertwee.",Doomsday

25,Aaron1375,Basically Escape from New York and Mad Max combined...which is a good thing.,8,20 March 2008,"Seriously, this movie rather surprised me in how much bloody action there was. I was just desperate to see a movie, and my parents told me they saw previews of this movie and I thought I would give it a go. In fact, I have never known less about a movie before seeing it than this one. So imagine my surprise when I got a very kick ass movie. Virtually non stop action that was really bloody. It was also one hell of a ride. The story, years earlier a disease known as the reaper virus takes out the north section of England and it is walled up, its citizens left to die. Years pass and London and the rest of England is not in very good shape. Overcrowding, financial turmoil and crime runs rampant. Add to this, the fact the reaper virus has appeared once again. What can be done you ask? Well it seems that the reaper virus did not kill everyone in the infected zone, one of whom was a doctor working on a cure. Enter a special agent girl who has ties and a few other soldiers and they are off to this area walled off so many years ago in search of this doctor and possibly a cure. What they find is that the citizens left have become a bit like savages and they are going through their own civil war. Lots of gun fights and chases ensue. We even have our gal fighting a knight as some of the people look like they are from the road warrior the others like they are from king Arthur's court. It ends with one rather cool car chase. However, it isn't perfect as there are a few to many flaws here and there such as a car that rams through a bus and remains almost untouched.

26,The_Void,The apocalyptic future according to Neil Marshall,6,12 May 2008,"Neil Marshall has cemented himself as one of the more noteworthy new horror film directors with his first two feature films - the excellent Dog Soldiers and The Descent. Following up on those two was always going to be a hard task, and while on the whole Doomsday is not as great as Marshall's previous two films; it's an enjoyable thrill ride and cult film fans are likely to find a lot to like about it. The film is not original in the slightest and takes ideas from a large number of sources; mainly post-apocalyptic stuff such as Escape from New York and Mad Max, but there's also ideas from zombie movies and other areas of cinema in there too. The plot focuses an idea we saw twice in 2007; that being that a killer virus wipes out the population. In this case, it happens in Scotland and the area is quickly cordoned off with the infected left to die. We then pick up the story in 2035 and the virus has returned and is threatening London; meaning a crack team (lead by the beautiful Eden Sinclair) must re-enter the city that was cordoned off in order to locate a survivor and stop the virus' outbreak.The film was clearly never meant to be 'great', and it isn't; but it manages to be lots of fun and the camp style that Marshall has created is one of the film's strongest elements and is sure to delight cult aficionados. The film moves pretty quickly and it doesn't take long to get to the point, which is certainly a good thing. Once we do get to the point, the action doesn't really let up at all and Marshall provides a constant stream of fight scenes, snappy dialogue and tasteless scenes of gore. It has to be said that at times the film does go a little too over the top, but the director certainly keeps the audience guessing and it's never really clear where the film is going, which keeps it exciting. The director has recruited a strong cast to be bring his vision to life; the beautiful Rhona Mitra leads a strong cast that includes Sean Pertwee, Bob Hoskins, Michael McDowell and Craig Conway; although the biggest standout for me was the stunning stunt woman Lee-Anne Liebenberg who stands out as a crossbow wielding enforcer. There are certain things I didn't like; the use of 'When Two Tribes Go to War' towards the end didn't really fit and some of the dialogue is awkward, but if you just want something to provide entertainment for a couple of hours; you can't go wrong with Doomsday.",Doomsday
27,deloudelouvain,Dumb writing.,4,22 May 2020,"I thought it would be a good idea watching this one during this virus crisis, and it started promising but it got more ridiculous the more the story advanced. Without revealing to much but seeing the infected turn into some kind of Mad Max punks at one side and medieval characters at the other side it's just too stupid for words. Half of the story just made no sense at all just because of stupid details like that. I don't know why a virus suddenly would make people change their cozy modern outfits to wearing rags and why they would change their firearms with bats and swords, it's just dumb writing of a story. The acting was what to expect with this kind of movies, nothing award winning. But there is some actions, with some dumb situations and bad choices, I guess it's mildly entertaining for some.

So we decided to see it and just relied on IMDb's rating and I have to say that I really liked it. While it kinda relies on what other films have already done, this film still kicks butt! I was so on the edge of my seat during the entire film, it was such an exciting story and is non-stop on the action. I tell you, I know everyone is crazy about Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider, Rhona Mitra, this girl i going to give Angelina a run her money. I've seen this girl really develop in the films since Hollow Man and The Life of David Gale where she had pretty mediocer roles, but she has such a presence and is so believable as a tough girl, she's just awesome in Doomsday. While it's not the most original story, it's still a great one to watch with amazing effect.Eden is living in a rough world, set in 2035, she was ripped away from her mother very young, and now is in an army fighting a virus war that has wiped away more than half of England is coming back and attacking her city. The government sends her and several others outside ""the wall"", they are going to find the cure for the disease. Instead, they find themselves in a world of rebels who are going to kill them for what they did 30 years ago by abandoning them during the high time of the virus. Eden and her team are brutally attacked, she has to find the leader of the land, Kane. She escapes with Kane's daughter and goes back to the mid evil times almost, instead of it being the future, a group has decided to use mid evil armor and horses and castles to improve their society. Eden and her surviving crew finally make it back but now have to deal with the government that is abandoning their country.Doomsday is without a doubt a really fun action movie, one of the better one's of 2008. While it's a little over done, it's one of those movies that needs the fun effects and over the top dialog, it's just a fun apocalypse movie. I loved Rhona, she was so awesome when she was facing Kane and said that she would kill the soldier where he stood, god, she's so great!

Which isn't really a positive thing, with some of it's influence from some 70's and 80's cult classic movies. So it basically pays homage to some of the 70's and 80's action and horror movies. Rhona Mitra is freaking hot in this movie as the warrior girl leader, kinda feel like her character was influenced by Motoko Kusanagi from ""Ghost in the Shell"".

31,Buddy-51,off-the-rails idiocy,3,11 April 2010,"If you combined ""Camelot"" with ""Road Warrior"" and ""Robin Hood"" with ""I Am Legend,"" you might come up with something like ""Doomsday,"" a jaw-dropping concoction whose sole claim to fame is that it proves that British filmmakers are every bit as capable of producing a really bad action flick as their American counterparts.In terms of plot, ""Doomsday"" is yet another futuristic action picture designed to turn the general populace into a bunch of paranoid hypochondriacs. The movie begins in 2008, just as a mysterious killer virus has broken out in Scotland, forcing the citizens of that country to be quarantined behind reinforced metal barriers (constructed on the site of Hadrian's Wall) and coastal blockades. Twenty-seven years later, a new strain of the disease has emerged in London, forcing a team of military operatives, led by the take-no-prisoners, ass-kicking Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra), to be sent into the quarantined area (where evidence suggests there may be some healthy survivors) to find out if there is indeed a cure for the disease and to bring it back to England with them when they return. But the team gets more than it bargained for when it enters the famed ""hot zone"" of Glascow - namely an out-of-control society where any semblance of morality and law-and-order has long since broken down, the inhabitants have turned into insatiable cannibals, and one sector of the population at least - in an act of supreme screen writing idiocy - has donned Medieval attire and retreated to a castle deep in the nation's interior to begin the process of building their world anew amidst jousting tournaments and fight-to-the-death gladiatorial contests.Written and directed by Neil Marshall, the appropriately titled ""Doomsday"" comes replete with stilted dialogue, wooden acting, laughable action sequences, a corny hail-to-Dorothy-the-wicked-witch-is-dead conclusion, and the kind of grunge-chic that has become the standard-issue look for any and all post-apocalyptic tales since the ""Mad Max"" movies of the 1980s. Even the likes of once A-list players like Malcolm McDowell and Bob Hoskins get mired in the muck. The art direction and production design are decent, but a single additional word of praise lavished on this cheapjack, gory - I lost track of the beheadings - and vilely sadistic ""28 Days Later"" knockoff would be excessive indeed. It is good for a few laughs, though.",Doomsday
32,Robert_duder,A rare breed of film in the new millennium...I liked it...just not sure why?,8,19 April 2008,"Doomsday started and I probably rolled my eyes fifteen times before the first hour was up and I'm thinking...man this is crap...but then a particularly thumping action scene started and I thought...hey wait a minute, this is actually pretty well done and I'm really hooked and the costumes are crazy and over the top and some of the performances are about the same. I started thinking about 70's and 80's campy apocalyptic action flicks that gained enormous cult status (The Warriors, Mad Max, Escape from New York) and I suddenly realized that for the first time in many, many years I was watching a movie that was so bad that it was really, really good not unlike Evil Dead or films like that. You can't set out to make a film like this (although they tried with Snakes On A Plane) it's just something that happens and I predict right now that 10, 15 years from now Doomsday will have this little cult status and everyone will rave about how it was ahead of it's time in some weird way. Doomsday is not un-entertaining, in fact it has some very good action sequences and the action is literally non stop, the one thing the film definitely isn't...boring.Although this joke has been played out...Rhona Mitra plays Kate Beckinsale playing Selena (from Underworld) who plays Eden Sinclair. Mitra has Beckinsale down to a T and even bares a striking resemblance to her but she does a good job. None of these facts change that she is a kick ass heroine who does a good job in the role. She's touch as nails, sexy, strong, and very agile in the role. P.S. Mitra is also playing a character in the next Underworld film...how eerie. Bob Hoskins who, in his day, was a truly great actor kind of lowers himself a little in this film but still brings a touch of class and energy to the cast as an aging chief of police. I had hoped he would have a bigger role but he is still pretty good. Alexander Siddig plays a small and yet important and decently done role as the Prime Minister of Britain (I think they tried to make him look a little like Tony Blair.) Malcolm McDowell is very good as Kane, the leader of the people inside the quarantined zone. The role is not big but McDowell plays him in a twisted and disturbing fashion. Craig Conway is Sol, the completely over the top, deranged killer who has started his own band of misfits in the quarantine zone. He makes this film a little crazy and campy and yet he is an awesome bad guy and adversary to our hero.I'm reading review after review that call this a complete and utter non-original story ripped from previous films most of which I mentioned earlier. Some call this an homage and others call it just recycled material. But so many films are recycled material now and I don't think director and writer Neil Marshall copied as much as he was inspired by Apocalyptic films and thought it would be fun to make his own. He obviously appreciated the genre enough to even make his own film a version of campy good times. I mean all in all this movie is bad...it's not good...some of the special effects are cheesy, the story is brief and rather slapped together and yet when it's all said and done and when you want to give it a 5 or maybe a 6 out of ten you realize that you loved it inexplicably and that's okay with me. I haven't seen any apocalyptic films that I can remember as of late so Doomsday was new to me and I like when something surprises me even if I hated enough to love it...movies fanatics will know what I mean. As I said this one will likely end up in cult status land and it deserves it in some twisted way. Wish it had done more financially or gone straight to video so we could have seen some really bad sequels...my one wish for the night. 8.5/10",Doomsday
33,bowmanblue,The perfect storm of nonsense,8,10 January 2015,"Paying 'homage' to other films can be touch and go at the best of times. Sometimes it ends up looking like a film's just blatantly copied another (most likely superior) movie and you get nothing new.However, with 'Doomsday' you can never be entirely sure which homage you're watching. We join the action a few decades in the future where Scotland has been quarantined due to a virus wiping out the population (possibly down to an infected deep-fried Mars bad - we don't know). However, when the virus resurfaces in London, an elite squad is send north of the border to try and find a cure.Yes, it's a B-movie, but it's a damn fine one. When the team assembles, we get extreme shades of the Colonial Marines from Aliens (see some 'borrowed dialogue' even), then we move on to Escape From New York (even down to the fact that the central character has only one eye) and Mad Max 2 when it comes to fighting the enemies. Finally, give it a 28 Days Later feel with the vibe and musical score and you have one hell of a violent mess of a film.With this many elements in the mix, it's never going to sit together perfectly, but then I doubt the film-makers ever intended it to be perfect. It has its faults and there are plot-holes aplenty if you're in the mood to pick holes in it. However, I watch Doomsday purely to be entertained. I'm not looking for high-quality drama or a watertight script.It's severely tongue-in-cheek, even bordering on daft at some stages. And good on it. It can never hope to compete with the serious Hollywood action blockbusters, so it carves out its own niche in the market by copying other films in a 'knowing' way.For everyone who loves this film (like me) there will be someone who absolutely hates it. And I can understand where they're coming from. If you're expecting some high-quality, Hollywood action, then you may be disappointed. To get maximum enjoyment from Doomsday, put your brain on hold, grab the biggest bucket of popcorn, place your tongue firmly in your cheek and enjoy the crazy ride.A true guilty pleasure film if ever there was one.",Doomsday
34,MLDinTN,This is the female Bruce Willis movie,4,5 January 2009,"The lead character in this, Major Eden Sinclair, reminded me of the female version of Bruce Willis in films like Die Hard. She is the ultimate butt kicker, wins against impossible situations, and finds time to through a cheesy one liner in here and there. Sinclair is hired to lead a group of soldiers into quarantined Scotland. It is the future and a virus has wiped out Scotland. England has built a barrier around Scotland to contain the virus. It is now years later and the virus has shown up in London. The prime minister believes a cure can be found in Scotland because they have visual evidence that there were survivors.It turns out the survivors have decided to become punk rockers and tortures and want to kill the invading soldiers. No one seems willing to help out. Some of them are killed and a few of them including Sinclair are captured. Now it is time for superwoman to show up as she escapes, befriends the daughter of the scientist she is hunting, and basically survives to meet the rescue helicopter.There is also a scene straight from Gladiator. Sinclair battles this armored giant and it's just like what Russell Crowe did.There is a lot of violence and blood in this. A couple of scenes stand out. One is when Sinclair beheads the girlfriend of Sol, it's pretty gross. But one of the most disturbing scenes in a film that isn't x rated was in this. It was sick. A guy is burned alive and the movie shows this. Then it shows his charred body and they start cutting parts of the meat off to eat. Disgusting. That really shouldn't be in a film like this.FINAL VERDICT: If you like gore, you'll like this. However, a couple of scenes are a bit too much.",Doomsday
35,A_Different_Drummer,How bad a film? Let me count the ways...,2,10 May 2014,"Ever since Mad Max, there has been a tendency for certain over-ambitious directors with (perhaps) excessively high self-esteem to take upon themselves the task of showing what the world would be like if civilization as we know it ended ... and all that remained ... was their film. Perhaps an oversimplification of the hubris involved, but essentially true.Omigawd, this film could be used as a training film (in film school) of what NOT to do: 1. Don't start with a pompous drawn out explanation of the backstory unless the front story is strong enough to make up for the wasted time. 2. Don't dim the lighting FOR THE ENTIRE MOVIE because you think that punches up the notion of hard times and the end of civilization. It simply will cause a migraine. 3. Don't have the same ""suspense"" music running the background for the entire movie, especially if there is no suspense. See above comment on migraine. 4. Don't write the script yourself if you are already maxed out with the directing job, and not even sure you know how to do THAT. 5. Make sure there is at least one character the audience can connect with, otherwise interest will lag. (See Migraine comment above) 6. Avoid using ""name"" actors at the latter stages of their career who will basically be willing to read the back of a dog food can aloud just for the paycheck.The ONLY (repeat ONLY) thing of interest is that Mitra seems to be doing an audition for her yet to come breakout role in Strike Back.",Doomsday
36,paulclaassen,Mad Max caught between the future and the past...,5,11 March 2021,"Uhm, wow, I have to think about this one for a while. As a whole, 'Doomsday' is unlike anything I've seen before.'Doomsday' is a mix of 'Resident Evil', 'Gladiator', 'Escape from New York', and shamelessly borrows heavily from 'Mad Max'. Add medieval elements in a film set in the future (!!) and you have 'Doomsday'. And the lead actress (Emma Cleasby) looks so much like Kate Beckinsale in 'Underworld'. Wow, this is a most unusual mix, and I'm still deciding whether or not it actually works.This is a futuristic, post-apocalyptic film with a medieval feel, and loads of action. The action sequences are fast-paced and incredible. There's a chase scene involving heavy armor vehicles, smashing everything in its path, and a Bentley vs vehicles straight out of a Mad Max movie.When a deadly virus broke out, Scotland was divided by a wall. One side of the wall is futuristic, while the other side has a medieval look - complete with outfits, gladiator arenas, and they are still fighting using a bows and arrows. There's a father and son rivalry in the midst of soldiers on a mission to retrieve a cure for the virus, believed to be on the other side of the wall. Some scenes are barbaric, of which the scene of cannibals roasting (and then cutting and eating) a man was the most difficult scene to watch.The film's cinematography is excellent, and it has a good score and soundtrack. The performances were also very good. As mentioned, this is a film unlike any other, so it definitely is an acquired taste.

39,southdavid,Gheorghe Anthropop-hagi,5,2 December 2020,"Another idle Amazon choice was ""Doomsday"", Neil Marshall's 2009 follow up to ""The Decent"" a gory and lurid, if perhaps derivative action film, that is mostly mediocre, though the effects are nicely done.Thirty years after a pandemic (can't relate) leads to everywhere North of Hadrian's wall becoming a wasteland of corpses, cannibals and medieval cosplayers, Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) and her team head North of the wall to try and find a cure for the returning virus, that has now infected central London. Their mission revolves around Doctor and Scientist Kane (Malcolm McDowell) but he's long since forgotten his Hippocratic oath for the life of a feudal Laird.I liked the gory, visceral effects of ""Doomsday"", the splattered body parts and blood hitting the camera, but I could take or leave a lot of the rest of the film, mostly because it all felt like something that I'd seen before. It cribs a lot of its story from other films; a bit of ""Escape from New York"", a bit of ""V for Vendetta"" and some big dollops of ""28 Days Later"" and ""Mad Max"". Action wise, the film is really rather good - and its clear why Marshall established himself as the king of the Battle scenes in things like ""Game of Thrones"". Rhona Mitra has a habit of playing tough, cool, badass women and she's no different in this one. Sean Pertwee, Emma Cleasby and Darren Morfitt return from ""Dog Soldiers"". There are also turns from Alexander Siddiq, Bob Hoskins and a maniacal performance by another returning ""Dog Soldiers"" actor, Craig Conway, who plays the homicidal leader of the Glasgow Cannibals.It's a middling story though, as I say, cribbing bits from other films and pulling them into an almost videogame-esque adventure. Shoot your way out of here, escape from there, there are even boss fights at various points. It's a collection of moments, rather than a story. It's not a particularly believable world either, if most of the population is dead, why would anyone stay in the city as a cannibal, rather than head out to hunt wildlife and farm? Why are the cannibals all so well drilled in their attack patterns, and for this specific an encounter too? The music choices, both licenced and the score are terrible also.It's not the worst film I've ever seen, and there are cool moments, but it's one of the most unoriginal.",Doomsday

Unless whomever took the chance on this film needed a tax write-off for the year, they may be regretting it, but I have to say I was surprised a bit by this one. There have been so many of this type of films released since the new millennium became a consideration, and after a time, they all start sounding, looking, and feeling alike. This one felt like Escape From New York meets Resident Evil with a little smattering of Mad Max thrown in here and there.That's not a bad mix, if you ask me, and Malcolm McDowell's involvement does not hurt one bit. So many here have detailed the story ad nauseum, so I won't do that, nor will I spoil the story. I will suffice it to say that I enjoyed this far more than I expected. The acting quality was a pleasant surprise. The villains were villainous without the usual restraint. The heroic moments were heroic without monologuing or speech giving.

41,Bezenby,A true depiction of Glasgow in 2009,8,29 June 2009,"Doomsday is pure comedy gold, and it's supposed to be that way. I've got to wonder at folks who approached this film with a serious mind, and those who were surprised at it's derivative and campy feel, because there's about a thousand moments in the film that clearly signpost that Doomsday it out strictly for laughs and gory fun. I'll list some of the more obvious ones near the end of the review.An incurable virus appears in Glasgow and spreads through the population, causing the British Government to basically rebuild Hadrian's Wall, leaving everyone trapped in Scotland. A little girl manages to escape, growing up to become an extremely violent government agent.When the virus appears again in an overpopulated London, she's sent up North with a crack (or rather, crap) team of soldiers to find the cure, as scientist Malcolm McDowell was one of those left behind when the wall was completed. The thing is, he's completely mental, and living in a medieval castle. His son isn't exactly doing too well in the sanity stakes either, as he's the leader of an army of cannibals in Glasgow.Doomsday is all about taking the best bits of eighties action and firing them all together. You've got Aliens, Escape from New York, Excalibur, Mad Max plus Italian movies like 2019: After the Fall of New York and Bronx Warriors (the skulls mounted on the front of the bikes). Is it meant to be taken seriously? Not at all in the slightest. For example: Malcolm McDowell's castle has a very modern emergency exit sign on its back door.During the battle at the end, you can see one of those traffic calming signs flashing 'slow down'.Dialogue lifted directly from aliens.The cannibal leader pours a thirty-year old can of Tennants lager over our heroine.Even the font used for some of the titles is lifted directly from Carpenter's The Thing, amongst others.Big budget trash movies are great. We need more of these (and we do - see the new Rambo movie, Mutant Chronicles and Windtalkers) - They are a lot more fun than any serious minded action movie.",Doomsday

It's a bit like modern day version of Mad Max in that scene takes place in an apocalyptic world with bunch of wild savages in mohican hairdo.Outbreak forces British government to quarantine half of Scotland. A force of elite soldiers are selected to extract people with information about antigen for the virus.This movie is one of great action flick with almost non-stop action from start to finish.

Well, I'll tell you why not: this is an entertaining movie and definitely one of the better movie of the science-fiction genre. Okay, the director liberally borrows from other movies like Mad Max and Alien, and the story gets a little muddled, but the end product is something that is part goofy, part campy and all entertaining. What is best about the movie is the acting. Craig Conway gives one of the great over-the-top performances in any movie. Mr. Conway's performance actually carries the movie. Also, Ms. Rhoda Mitra is absolutely wonderful in the leading role. She could be the next Sandra Bullock which is saying a lot because Sandra Bullock is a great actress. Also the movie maintains a high energy level and offers an interesting subplot of family conflict which although far-fetched works for this movie.",Doomsday
44,dee.reid,"""Doomsday"" - The end is nigh!",9,14 March 2008,"""Doomsday,"" the third feature from British ""B""-movie tour de force writer-director Neil Marshall, is a rehash of several distant cult movies, including both of Marshall's previous films, which are also considered cult classics. Yet, that doesn't make ""Doomsday"" even remotely bad, but it does make it very interesting not just to follow the story along, but to also point out the many references to films past.Even the most amateurish film buff could point out the assorted references to ""28 Days/Weeks Later,"" ""Escape from New York"" (1981), ""Aliens"" (1986), and the ""Max Mad"" movies. It's all part of the fun, really, and you can't blame Marshall for making references to the movies he loves and have inspired him as a filmmaker. Even his first feature ""Dog Soldiers"" (2002) and his superior follow-up horror flick ""The Descent"" (2005) get some mention here.In the future, an out-of-control virus called the ""Reaper virus"" (the ""28"" movies) completely decimates Scotland, eventually leading to its being quarantined off with a 20-foot-tall, 12-inch-thick impenetrable wall (""Escape from New York"") on all sides. The rest of the world goes on as if nothing happened, while millions are forced to fend for themselves in the virus-ravaged wasteland of former Scotland. In the the 30 years since the quarantine, law & order broke down and anarchy took over.30 years later, the Reaper Virus makes a comeback, this time outside the quarantine zone. More news develops when spy satellites monitoring the former Scotland detect human survivors. Could there be uninfected people? Could there be a cure in there somewhere? Regardless, the government organizes a small task force to go inside and find answers. Nelson (Bob Hoskins), a government handler, is given the assignment of having his best operative Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) go inside with a crack team of commandos and look for answers.They have 48 hours.Right away, ""Doomsday"" removes itself from other post-apocalyptic movies by not focusing on the catastrophe itself and instead just focuses on humanity's attempt to move forward. ""Doomsday"" is about anarchy, and the downfall of society: What happens when you just leave a country to wither and die in the face of disaster? On the inside, however, it's all about finding a cure or a vaccine and bringing it back to the rest of the world. When Sinclair and her team are on the inside, they're all on their own, but of course they are not alone. As it turns out, barbaric clans have been formed (the ""Mad Max"" movies), under the leadership of Sol (Marshall's favorite go-to guy and movie regular, Craig Conway), who seeks to lead his punk regalia-clad minions to the conquest of the free world outside the quarantine zone. It should be pointed out here that they're pretty much cannon fodder (""Aliens"").It's fair to chide ""Doomsday"" for some script deficiencies and overly-abundant throwback references to films past and an apparent lack of details regarding Scotland's decimation in the 30 years since the Reaper Virus's outbreak, and Sol's rise to power. But Marshall keeps ""Doomsday"" lean and focused. Once on the inside, it's anything goes, as Sinclair and her teammates are pretty much left to fend for themselves when Sol's men ambush them and force them to participate in increasingly sadistic games of violence for survival and for that, the blood and gore is sufficient (Marshall knows no boundaries in the area of special effects).""Doomsday"" is an accomplished third feature from a provocative filmmaker, Neil Marshall. Though by no means perfect (""The Descent"" was and I was feverishly looking for ""Doomsday"" to surpass it), ""Doomsday"" is still looking to make a killing at the movies this weekend.9/10",Doomsday

By the third shift in cast, setting and theme, I'd written the whole thing off and was content to just sit back and enjoy the train wreck.

In fact, at times it feels like he put those movies into a blender and hit frappé.For a while it works quite well, and at times he even manages to play on their level. Unfortunately the second half sort of goes off the rails, with the simple narrative wriggling from his grasp and the tightly focused homage collapsing under its own weight.Star Rhona Mitra does her best Kurt Russell, and vets like Bob Hoskins and Malcolm McDowell do a lot with a little, but even they get swept aside in the unfettered chaos.",Doomsday

49,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Neil Marshall's bloody homage to several films,6,3 February 2016,"Neil Marshall's Doomsday is a bloody, balls to the wall homage to several different kinds of films, and while it may wear it's influences on its sleeve with complete lack of subtlety that some will read as being derivative, it's still a blast of B-movie fun with some neat set pieces and heaps of nasty ultra violence. It's basically 28 Days Later, Mad Max, Escape From New York and Need For Speed all rolled into one package. When a ravaging virus attacks the UK, a giant, impenetrable wall is built around Scotland to act as a quarantine. Years later when the disease resurfaces, British parliament sends in a team of mercy to gain the knowledge from survivors within the wall and hopefully find a cure. Rhonda Mitra, channels a tougher Lara Croft as Eden Sinclair, a warrior extraordinaire who heads the team with grit and grace, mentored by a cranky Bob Hoskins. Closely watched by slimy, untrustworthy politician Canaris (David O Hara is all scum under a lake of ice) they venture into bonny Scotland and find themselves in way over their heads. From there it's a dizzying parade of car chases, battles with marauding cannibal savages, road warrior style mayhem, and a visit to ex scientist turned medieval despot Marcus Kane (Malcolm McDowell) in his remote castle, setting the stage for a fight that's straight out of gladiator. It's all fairly preposterous, but the movie couldn't care less and blasts along on its own wild trajectory like a Rottweiler let off its leash in a furniture shop. Mitra makes a solid heroine, and the villainous turns from both McDowell, O Hara and live wire Craig Conway as the cannibal's brutal chieftain are super fun. Marshal has an eye for staging especially violent action, and with a film that wants to give shout outs to three of the most violent films ever made, he's the guy for the job. Not a great movie, but a neat, nasty little slice of smash and burn action fireworks that will put a fore poker to your pulse.",Doomsday
50,kairingler,homage to Mad Max,6,26 April 2009,"i really do believe that in some small way that this film is an homage to the MaD mAX series and possibly escape from n.y. i liked this movie for the most part, it had a lot of good fighting scenes in it,, i did like the idea of the guy in the knight outfit, with the sword on horseback that was pretty cool to watch,, and the line that our female lead gives upon seeing his character in the woods,, now there's something you don't see everyday,, now to me that was pure classic cinema right there folks. Malcolm Macdowell was in here but he really didn't impress me much, so was Bob Hoskins,, but again not really that impressive. overall it's a good update i think, kinda like mad max and escape from new york revisited, with a different twist.",Doomsday
51,dworldeater,"Awesome, my kind of movie! Neil Marshall does not disappoint",8,22 November 2016,"At this point I have already been a fan of writer/director Neil Marshall, as I have already seen Dog Soldiers and The Descent and are among my favorite modern horror films. Doomsday is Neil Marshall's take on the post apocalyptic action/science fiction genre. The film is mostly a combination of 28 Days Later, Escape From New York and The Road Warrior. The film brings us back to the good ole' days(the 80's) and is a highly entertaining and blood soaked action fest that I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. The flick is a little campy, but looks great and favors practical f/x and delivers huge with tons of great gory action. Rhona Mitra is our gorgeous lead and is very effective here as a female equivalent to Snake Pliskin. She does well in the fights and gives a very good performance here as the lead in this film. Bob Hoskins and Malcolm McDowell appear as well and are awesome as well. While there is a whole lot of stuff made that just does'nt appeal to me, Doomsday is totally the type of movie that at least, I want to see. I am sure this won't be the sort of film that gets awards, but it gets a thumbs up from me and is awesome in my book.",Doomsday
52,Jonny_Numb,Don't forget Excalibur when you Escape from New York 28 Days Later,5,18 March 2008,"A bubble of such near-impenetrable critical praise surrounded ""The Descent"" back in 2006 that any argument of its greatness became moot, and for good reason: not since ""The Blair Witch Project"" had a horror film been given such unanimous praise. And while I don't hold ""The Descent"" on a master's level (I think the claustrophobic horror bests the creature-driven stuff), I still think it was a confident effort from Neil Marshall, who bucked the torture-porn trend to deliver something tense and effective. Even its winks toward genre favorites like ""Alien"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" seemed like fitting Valentines from one film-making generation to another.""Doomsday,"" on the other hand, is a film so saturated in homage that the overall experience can be labeled a fun rip-off at best, and a derivative, migraine-inducing mess at worst (leaning more toward the latter as it wears on). The film begins as a semi-serious, semi-playful riff on ""Escape from New York"" (most of the UK becomes a walled-in quarantine zone...) and ""28 Days Later"" (...containing a population stricken by plague), as bureaucrats enlist Eden Sinclair (Kate Beckinsa...er, Rhona Mitra), a cop with a traumatic past (and one false eye) to lead a group of cops into a London given over to anarchy and ostentatiously-pierced scumbags to find a cure.What's most stunning--and disheartening--about ""Doomsday"" is how it never feels like Marshall's own vision at work. Instead of filtering his influences through an individualistic perspective, putting a new spin on old conventions, he is complacent to shift from one stylistic imitation to the next (that Marshall has a higher budget than his forefathers only underlines his lack of ingenuity and creativity here). At one moment he'll invoke Ridley Scott (during a Medieval-tinged gladiator showdown), the anti-authoritarian diatribes of John Carpenter, and the gross-out humor of early Sam Raimi or ""Dead Alive""-era Peter Jackson (I'll admit I enjoyed a pitch-black gag involving a hand/retinal scan), to name a few glaring instances. By the end, he's devolved into Michael Bay--rapid cuts and zooms that make the climactic chase look like an apocalyptic sports-car commercial.Needless to say, a film this obsessed with surface attributes pushes the characters to the back burner. Malcolm McDowell (as a rogue scientist/Ren Faire leader), Bob Hoskins, and Mitra deliver dialog that is (much in the vein of Bay) mostly relegated to the occasionally-quirky one-liner. The supporting cast is so ill-defined that I'd challenge anyone to care about their fates, let alone remember their names.Marshall's decision to indulge a plethora of ""auteur"" hats also means he frequently succumbs to the overblown, in-your-face gore that has become the tiresome staple of current horror. The relative subtlety and restraint of ""The Descent"" has been given a 180-degree turn toward the blood-sick sadism of the ""Hostel"" and ""Saw"" flicks. Mining humor from pitch-black situations and morally repugnant characters takes a carefully trained director, but Marshall is merely content to sling tastelessness at the audience with reckless abandon, hoping something will stick. But since the characters are one-dimensional ciphers propelled along by the slim story, ""Doomsday"" comes closer to the dreck of an Eli Roth film than the inspired absurdity of a Monty Python sketch.",Doomsday
53,a_chinn,Disappointing love letter to 80s post apocalyptic sci-fi/action films,6,23 December 2017,"I really wanted to love this film, but it sadly disappoints. ""Doomsday"" is a love letter to ""Escape from New York"" and ""The Road Warrior"" with it's story of a deadly viral outbreak in Scotland that causes the entire northern part of the UK to be walled off and it's inhabitants left to their own devices for survival. The story then picks up 30 years later when the British government finds themselves needing to go back into the quarantined zone to search for the virus' origin after it resurfaces outside the walls in London. Rhona Mitra, complete with a Snake Pliskeen-style eyepatch, leads an elite group of soldiers inside the walls to search for their goal, fighting off various wasteland inhabitants. This part of the film worked well as fun homage to John Carpenters ""Escape from New York,"" but when the story takes an unexpected turn following Mitra's escape from the city into the picturesque countryside, where survivors have formed a medieval society led by Malcolm McDowell, it's too much of a genre shift to be believed or enjoyed. A homage to John Carpenter and George Miller is one thing, but when writer/director Neil Marshall decides to thrown in a ""Excalibur"" and ""Highlander"" homage, that's a bit much. The film does come to life again in the final third act, which involves an extended Road Warrior-like car chase through the wastelands, but Marshall is sadly no George Miller when it comes to action, though in all fairness, who is? Although I may seem mostly negative in my review, there really is a lot to like. Rhona Mitra is very good in the lead, the urban wasteland production design and costume design are both spot on, as are the car designs in the final Max Max inspired sequences. Marshall is a talented director (""The Descent"" is a genuine horror classic), but ""Doomsday"" is not up to Carpenter and Miller standards. If a filmmaker wants to make a homage such as this, it either needs to be able to live up to it's source material or it needs to be able to offer something new. ""Doomsday"" offers neither. Quentin Tarantino manages to do both brilliantly in nearly all of his films (heist films, blaxploitation films, revenge films, kung-fu films,, grindhouse, war films, westerns, etc.). On it's own, I'm not sure how ""Doomsday"" would be received by audiences unfamiliar with 80s post apocalyptic films, but for audience members with an affection for these film, which Marshall certainly has, this film does offer enough treats to be worth watching, even if the overall experience seems disappointing. Overall, if watching ""1990: The Bronx Warriors"" or ""Cherry 2000"" is your idea of a good time, you should definitely check this film out.",Doomsday
54,Samiam3,A derivative but kick-ass B-movie,7,20 November 2010,"It's Aliens, meets Escape from New York, meets Mad Max, meets Excalibur. Despite being derivative, Doomsday kicks-butt in a fashion which is spectacular enough to warrant a hundred minute time investment. The key to enjoying it is you have to be a horror/sci-fi lover while not being offended that the movie pilfers from some of the genres best examples. In particular, Neil Marshall's screenplay owes a lot to Escape from New York. He obviously loves John Carpenter so much that he even steals his title font.Major Eden Sinclair and her team are hired by the British government to track down a long lost doctor who may be able to cure a virus that is slowly devouring London. To find him, they must enter Scotland, which has been under quarantine for years, and is now over run by cannibalistic goons who will eat anything that enters their terrain.Given that every scene is a new adventure, Doomsday would make a hell of a video game, and Rhona Mitra who has a killer screen presence further makes such an idea sound promising. Perhaps if Doomsday had more to offer in the way of character and a bit less of a dependence on its predecessors, it might have been great. But it was good enough for me.",Doomsday
55,Rob_Taylor,The funniest and most entertaining movie I've seen this year!,9,23 June 2008,"Seriously. I think the people hating this movie don't really have a sense of humour. I can understand the complaints about cheesy dialogue, derivative scene-stealing and all the other ""negatives"" that are complained about here. But, and it is a big BUT, that's also the reason this movie works so well and entertains so thoroughly. Of course, opinion is subjective, so let me explain why I found this movie so much fun.Firstly, it's a post-apocalyptic tale - my favourite genre. I like films such as 28 Days, Mad Max et al where humanity has descended into barbarism where only the strong and ruthless survive. Doomsday is this genre, though on a more localised scale (i.e. only Scotland has fallen prey to the virus). If you like such films, then DD will entertain for much of its running time.However, rather than be some Mad Max clone there are several other elements thrown into the mix which are at first confounding, then increasingly delightful to watch. The harsh will call them plagiarism, but I prefer to think of them as homages to the writers/directors favourite movies.Having set the scene in a 28 Days Later style and promised us a Mad Max-esquire Scotland, the movie instead gives us Aliens, complete with APC's, marines and mood lighting extremely similar to Cameron's movie. The marines even go in search of the ""med lab"" which had me chuckling and waiting for the proverbial crap to hit the fan. When it does, the Mad Max style comes on in full force, with some homage paid to Thunderdome and a maniacal villain that seems modeled on Dennis Hopper's villain from Waterworld. Our heroes escape (via a train - another homage to Thunderdome perhaps?) and then the movie becomes truly bizarre.Cue Malcolm McDowell and his enclave of technology-is-evil medieval, armour clad, horse-riding knights. A full on feudal colony. The best way I can describe it is Mad Max meets Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves! It's really bizarre, and really amusing to watch. There's also a Gladiator-like arena face-off for our heroine to deal with before the inevitable escape sequence.Trapped in an underground storage facility, our heroes desperately search the manifest for something to help them get away from the middle-ages lunatics chasing them. I really don't know what I expected when they began to open crates... guns I expect, perhaps even something nasty like napalm? What they get is a Bentley automobile! Cue Mad Max Road Warrior-like chase scene when they go back past our less-than-friendly human throwbacks. There's even a white van complete with ladders used by the bad guys. The whole chase is completely silly and accompanied by the strains of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's Two Tribes song. Amazing fun! I really don't know how to describe this film to prospective viewers. If you like over-the-top entertainment and are not worried by seeing several movies rolled into one then go for it. Let the insane goodness of it wash over you! Don't think of it as plagiarism, instead consider it an homage to other, more serious, movies and you will enjoy it a lot more.SUMMARY: Derivative and cheesy, but tremendously good fun nonetheless!",Doomsday
56,Matt_Layden,Mad Max On Steroids.,6,7 August 2008,"Yet another film that deals with a virus that kills humanity, well, actually it's just Scotland. A wall is build around the island to contain the virus. Years later it is discovered that there are still people alive within the walls. Thinking there is a cure, a team goes back to retrieve it.I've been fan of Marshall since Dog Soldiers. He manges to take an old and tired genre and create something new and exciting out of it. He continue this with The Descent. That film turned out to be one of the scariest films of recent years. Now Marshall has a bigger budget and a more ambitious project. Doomsday is Marshall throwback to cheesy 80's action films. So much that the film itself doesn't feel original at all. Well, it isn't, but it is sure as hell a fun entertaining ride.Doomsday basically takes all the ingredients from campy action films and throws it in a blender. The two most obvious influences are Mad Max and Escape From New York. The lead character even has an eye patch to boot. You can call it a rip-of or a homage, either way it is a fun film. You really can't take anything seriously, you just sit back and enjoy the popcorn film as it is. If you do this, I guarantee you'll have a good time.The lead actress, who looks almost exactly like Selena from the Underworld films, plays our heroine. Just the right amount of tough stuff needed to get through this journey. In a list of badass female heroes, Rhona Mitra's Sinclair would make the list. Along side characters like Ellen Ripley and Betrix Kiddo. The acting from the supporting characters, including one Bob Hoskins, and the lead herself are decent. The villains do a lot of screaming and looking freaky. A nod has to be given to the make-up and costume designs. Everyone looks like they are straight out of a Mad Max film, complete with custom made death vehicles and super hot tattoos. Well, at least on one female character, who gets way too little screen time.The film manages to balance a wide variety of genre pretty well, including medieval times. While the castle and horses bit of the film is where it begins to lose some steam, it doesn't ruin the film. At first it may seem out of place, but then you realise that this is a new world that has been created an it fits nicely. The film goes between the Mad Max, medieval and virus spreading genres a few times and it may feel like you're watching completely different films, but that uniquely adds to the fun.The film is quite gory, more so then I thought it would be. I should have expected it to be though, considering in Marshall's earlier films he has soldiers duct-taping their guts back into their stomaches. This gore adds a horror element to it. We aren't use to seeing all this blood and guts in films other then horror. It adds a another level of enjoyment to Doomsday. That' if you're into that sort of thing.In my books, Marshall is 3/3, in terms of quality and entertainment. He's shown us he can scare us and entertain us. I had my doubts about this film, thinking the bigger budget would ruin Marshall's film-making style. I was wrong. It's Marshall's talent that makes Doomsday stick out from the other virus infected films and it's that talent that makes him a director to watch for the years to come. I mean honestly, how many films can you see a decapitated head screaming while flying towards and hitting the camera???",Doomsday
57,lewiskendell,"Why stick to one kind of action movie, when you can do them all at once?",7,3 August 2010,"""You don't see that every day.""Doomsday is the kind of passion project that a director usually only gets to make after he's made a critically and financially successful movie. Neil Marshall had that success with The Descent, and it seemed like he used this opportunity to take everything that was brewing in his brain and put it all into one movie, in case he never got to do something like this again.Doomsday is true over-the-top entertainment. It's a mishmash of so much stuff, that you never know where it's going to go next. One minute, you're seeing a viral quarantine. Next, it's a futuristic military action movie. Then, you're suddenly in the midst of a post- apocalyptic circus, with dance numbers, pole dancers, a gimp, and a cooked human or two on the menu. A sword fight and a train ride later, you're in the middle of Camelot. Knights, horses, and everything. Which (naturally) leads to a car chase that wouldn't look out of place in the new Mad Max movie. It's really quite amazing to have so many different scenarios thrown at you during the course of a single movie. It's ridiculous; but it works within the context of the story.I'll take Rhona Mitra as a sexy hard-ass over someone like Michelle Rodriguez any day. Her role is pretty one-note (all of them are, this isn't a nuanced character study by any stretch of the imagination), but she's convincing as the tough main character. The rest of the roles are filled out with a couple of known actors like Bob Hoskins and Malcolm McDowell and a few welcome returning faces from The Descent (including the lovely Myanna Buring, who NEEDs to be in more movies).Doomsday is about as far from The Descent in tone as you can get, but I enjoyed it the second time around even more than I remember liking it the first time. Just go with the craziness and enjoy the action. At the very least, I can promise that you won't be bored.",Doomsday
58,intelearts,"Too crude: and I mean the film, or is it a video game? Uwe Boll would wet his bed...",2,30 April 2008,"Firstly, I could weep - Neil Marshall was meant to be the great hope - a new voice creating film that was tense, memorable, and palpably free of conventions.Secondly, nothing against a good homage film - if you grew up enjoying Mad Max and Robin Hood (Or whatever) then fine make a film that is a homage to it; but please, make it well.Doomsday has a pretty redundant plot. Another viral epic, with Rhona Mitra as Eden Sinclair, a woman who is a major is the Domestic Defence Service, and a very mean fighter, she's out to find a cure, and nothing's going to stop her. The good news is Mitra. She's definitely in the running for major star status - and a Bond film. Adrian Lester is always good at the noble and dependable thing - but his part really does him no favours. The bad news is everything else.Especially the filming.Cut too tight in the fights, and shot too long in other places it fails to be an action film, or a horror film, or a mix.Is the story enough? Is the action enough? Not for me. It's way too much in the ""eat the human"" theme for those expecting a Mad Max type film but probably too so-so for hardcore horror fans - it just slides between too many chairs to really work.Plus it is just off-pace, we jump from one action scene to the next but the camera never creates a storyline, it just cuts, short cuts, etc; The actors all try to muddle their way through but most of the time look and feel like computer game dolls.Given the pedigree this is way below par, and is a crude offering - and I don't mean that in any positive sense. Just about any director could have made this - and its looking as though Neil Marshall is in danger of becoming just that.This is chasing Uwe Boll's title.Very, very mediocre.",Doomsday

In my opinion this works quite well since instead focusing on plot Neil Marshal makes a full out action movie with enough thrills and tension to make you wonder where it is heading. When you watch this for the first time you will be in suspense throughout. The second time you will be enjoying the action and the references to other movies more. Rhona Mitra is excellent as the female equivalent of Snake Plissken and even adds to it for obvious reasons. One thing you have to realize about Doomsday though. While having a top notch cast playing everything straight it does not take itself seriously. It is a B movie made to entertain, have fun with and nothing else. If you were expecting more horror or better story than chances are you will be disappointed.

There's really mindless violence, gory and gruesome splatter as well as off-the-scale performances. Nevertheless I would say that the story works on the whole, in spite of many excesses. It could be similar to ""I am Legand"" (some reviewers say it's a clone but that would be exaggerated) but it's not up to that masterpiece, in my opinion; anyway it's well acted and has its originality (the idea of UK territory split that way is really surprising).

Almost not related to its topic, has nothing to do with virus. Instead it became some funny weird joke and song. Bit funny and immoral and negative. But towards end it lost its topic. Also weird to see vehicles near cannibals, kings, knights, castles. Too mixed up different people and ages, that it looks not serious and unreal.

67,ElijahCSkuggs,Skinny girls with guns are not badass.,5,19 March 2008,"With Neil Marshall, I thought I had a new go-to director. One who would never fail to stay true to his roots. But then he had to go and make the commercial-to-the-max Doomsday. Story's about some She-Rah babe who is on a mission to find the cure for the Reaper Virus. This Reaper Virus has demolished Britain among other places, and thousands of lives. Throw in apocalyptic madmen, evil politicians, fancy cars, sword and gunplay, and you basically have Doomsday.The movie just isn't anything special. For fans of Marshall and his previous work, The Descent and Dog Soldiers, this is just a big fat question mark on his resume. It's just so damn average. You got the cliché tough girl leading the charge who probably weighs around 120 lbs soaking wet. The over-the-top madmen who pale in comparison to the Mad Max Madmen. The focus on the fancy cars. The bizarre feel that it's just trying much too hard to be creative and to impress you.The movie isn't a failure. It has plenty of blood and violence, and the action was passable. But that's pretty much it for me. Again, like any other She-Rah movies, I have a very difficult time enjoying a female lead who's supposed to be tough as nails, but is actually an ex or still working model. It boggles my mind how bad casting for movies are these days. Whatever. Hopefully Marshall will get back to the more-is-less type thinking and deliver us another solid film.

68,jaredmobarak,You don't see that everydayDoomsday,7,18 March 2008,"Forget all the subtle and nuance of mood from Neil Marshall's taut thriller The Descent; he decided to go all out with the new flick Doomsday. Call it 28 Weeks Beyond Thunderdome if you'd like as Marshall seems to cull all the best aspects of past cinema B-movie greats to create a pastiche that is one helluva ride. With a plot that serves only to give us an excuse for action and borderline comical characters introducing us to the punk-metal cannibal way of life as well as a separate sect going back to medieval times complete with king and executioner, you'll be wrestling with the urge to cheer, laugh, or cover your face without knowing which one to do. Check your brain at the door and buckle in for a good time with blood, cars, and fire galore.After an infection of the Reaper virus was discovered in Scotland, the entire half of the island was quarantined and left for dead. Only when the outbreak appears to be resurfacing some thirty years later in London and a new containment strategy is underway does the government decide to go back in search of a cure. Finding that there have been survivors up north behind the wall, it is assumed that there must be a cure to bring back and save humanity. If it were that easy, though, we wouldn't have half as much fun as we do. You see the one man that might have been able to invent the end of the disease, Kane, is not as sane as he might have been. Thirty years of being left behind has pushed any idealism from his head, deciding instead to use his immunity as the power to rule. Telling his people that they are the survivors of the virus and the outside has been destroyed, he is able to keep a short leash while he stays in his castle lording over them. His son Sol doesn't buy into it and takes a section with him to the cities, waiting for a rescue party that they can capture and use as a way out. Drop in some military and scientific personnelto find Kansmack dab in the middle of a war and the party begins.With a high bodycount and a complete lack of the necessity to show every character until their end, (Kane, played maliciously by Malcolm McDowell is a complete MacGuffin with little screen time and more mythical stature than actual man of any consequence), Doomsday leads us through a wasteland of carnage where the idea of a cure really falls away behind the desire to see if Major Eden Sinclair can kill more people and stay alive herself. It is too much to worry about a world about to be obliterated by a tiny microorganism when we have a woman's life at stake right before our eyes. You soon forget her mission and start putting all your interest behind her crazy carefree attitude taken with any adversary. The Major is portrayed by Rhona Mitra, an actress I have heard and seen very little of, although it appears she is on her way to becoming a household name among the internet film community. I tell you what, consider me won over. From the badass demeanor, the gladiator style beat-down, the high-speed driving prowess, an utter fearlessness, and not to forget a camera for an eye, Mitra takes this role and flies high with it, never looking back at reality.When you have this type of off-the-wall intrigue, you need to have some serious people to counterbalance the wackiness. We get the puppet Prime Minister from a favorite of mine Alexander Siddig along with the man who pulls his strings played by a raspy voiced David O'Hara. These two are included to try and give us some semblance of real world stakes while the circus continues on in the zoo that was Scotland. Even Mitra's handler is played straight by the always-great Bob Hoskins. They all help ground the film so that we can have our fun with characters like the city dwellers' leader Sol. In complete crazed manic wildness, Craig Conway steals the show. Between the mohawk, the face tattooed girlfriend with a tongue to rival KISS, a penchant for loud screams, and the dance moves to metal, this guy is one-of-a-kind. His crew pitted against Mitra's is a sight to behold.Through all the fights, stunts, and pyrotechnics, one sequence stands out above the rest. In what could be the most exhilarating car chase I have ever seen, Marshall treats us to some fantastic footage. He must have had cameras everywhere to film it all because I don't see them doing multiple takes. Why try to take a car out when you can jump through the front windows and battle with the driver at 100 mph? Watching a fast-paced car race with two guys hanging halfway inside the car, a gun changing hands, and elbows flying wildly is just fantastic. A bigger budget has allowed Marshall to spread his wings a bit and create an amalgam so familiar that it becomes uniquely original. I may not have learned anything nor found any emotive connection with the plight to save humanity, but I definitely left the theatre with a huge smile on my face.",Doomsday

71,jon.h.ochiai,"Wasted ""Doomsday""",5,19 March 2008,"Stunning Rhona Mitra is the only saving grace of the dreadful ""Doomsday"". Even her charismatic presence and black skin tight couture can not salvage this narrative quagmire from Director and Writer Neil Marshall. Marshall was actually very effective in ""The Descent"". That makes what happened here even more bewildering. ""Doomsday"" is a mutated clone on a number of levels. Beautiful Rhona Mitra resembles Kate Beckinsale of ""Underworld"", but is a more athletic version. The comparisons to ""Underworld"" are warranted-- in particular the Gothic nihilistic tone. No Vampires. Instead we have cannibalistic survivors of a deadly man-made virus. The ""Doomsday"" post apocalyptic world of 2033 lands as a cheap rip-off of ""The Road Warrior"" and ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunder Dome"". At times enduring the grotesque cinematic chaos becomes insufferable. There is a protracted scene in which one of Major Sinclair's (Mitra's) men is charred crispy and then consumed. ""Doomsday"" begins with a promising premise, but soon spirals out of control into the narrative abyss. This is too bad, because Mitra plays a great hero and Malcolm McDowell garners enough restraint as the compelling antagonist Kane.In 2008 a lethal virus eradicates Scotland killing hundreds of thousands of people. The Government in a radical measure to contain and quarantine the area erects an impenetrable Wall along the British border. One of those lucky to escape during this turmoil is young Eden Sinclair. Her mother apparently sacrifices her life to save her. The young child grows into Major Sinclair (Mitra), who is now a powerful and capable warrior.In 2033, the virus re-emerges in England; thus threatening total annihilation. However, intelligence photos of the quarantine region reveal survivors. Therefore, a cure for the virus may exist somewhere beyond the Wall. Prime Minister John Hatcher's (Alexander Siddig) national and political survival rests on finding this cure. Apparently Kane (whacked out Malcolm McDowell), who discovered the virus, may have developed an anti-virus. Hatcher tasks his security minister Bill Nelson (Bob Hoskins) to assemble a military team to retrieve the cure from the quarantine region. Nelson enrolls Major Sinclair (Mitra) to lead this mission. Sinclair quickly assembles her team, and they embark on their mission to find Kane and the cure. Once behind the Wall, the mission goes amokpredictably. Turns out that Kane (McDowell) has recreated his new world as a quasi-medieval existence where only the strong survive. From this point on the mission much like the movie becomes murky and incomprehensible.Even as a straight action movie ""Doomsday"" is puzzling. The quick cut edits, and dark atmosphere do little in defining crisp and engaging action sequences. Mitra performs the fight scenes admirably, though I'm guessing she is not a trained martial artist. It just comes off as sloppy. Most of the cloned ""Road Warrior"" high speed chases are embarrassing.The conclusion of ""Doomsday"" makes no sense at all. What was Neil Marshall's point? There are a bunch of silly post apocalyptic mutant zombie movies out there, and this one is really unpleasant and not all that much fun. Rhona Mitra and Malcolm McDowell are completely wasted here. And ""Doomsday"" was nearly a complete waste of two hours.",Doomsday
72,cultfilmfan,Doomsday,8,15 March 2008,"Doomsday takes place in a future post apocalyptic England, where much has been wiped out due to a lethal virus. A woman named Eden Sinclair is nominated by a policeman friend to go and lead a team to the outskirts of the city to try and find a cure for the virus. Once on the edge of the city they encounter survivors of the virus who now obey a former scientist named Kane, who has become their ruler and lots of action, violence and thrills come with this as the crew trying to find the cure has to fight off Kane's many followers who are bloodthirsty killers and look reminiscent of those you would find in any post apocalyptic film, or even a low budget Troma film for that matter. Doomsday was not screened for most critics to review, so in most cases that should tell you right off that it is not a good film because otherwise critics would have had a chance to review it. I was still interested in this film however, so I decided to give it a chance. Basically the film is a big budgeted and campy B movie although it does have a lot of style and things that do make it more entertaining than ludicrous even though it is pretty silly. The film's plot is quite hard to follow and what there is of a plot seems to be pretty out there and isn't really anything new or original. The film visually is quite interesting to look at and I was overall impressed by the style and production values done by the director and crew. As for the rest of it, I did find myself getting into this nonsense and actually enjoying it because of the stylish direction and the non stop action and gratuitous violence. In other words if you are a fan of films that are loud, violent and have non stop action, then this would be the perfect film for you. It's not a film that will go down in history for breaking any new barriers and it is most likely to become a film that would be seen on cable television at midnight when all the offbeat enthusiasts would be watching, but because the film kept me entertained and never bored me and because I did appreciate the style of the film I 'am giving the film the rating I have chosen because of this. Please note that this is in no way a masterpiece and is simply a slice of entertainment with style and gore that entertained me and nothing more. So with that in mind if this sounds right up your alley then I recommend it, however if you want something with more style and substance then check out some of the Oscar nominated films from last year that are now hitting DVD.",Doomsday

This is one of the worst lowest retarded violent offensive movies I have ever seen in my inter life! I can't even describe how boring violent this movie is. This movie kills animals, kills kids I hate this movie! Neil Marshall wrote and directed this peace sh**t movie who borrows story's and steals scenes from all those movies I am just counting (Escape from New York, Mad Max, Cyborg, 28 Days Later, Army of Darkness, Lord of the Rings and Resident Evil) mixed and it makes in too poorly paced boring stinker violent movie! The main hero is Rhona Mitra and she is a self centered selfish asshole! She didn't want to free that girl she only cared was her mission! A bad movie, way too violent and way to offensive for my taste and in my opinion Neil Marshall failed to make a good entertaining movie! Their is nothing likable in this movie at all. Virus and Soldiers are killing kids how offensive is that? Neil Marshal put a cannibals in this movie in which a man eater burns a human being men alive and then they eat his flash off his skin that was so disgusting. I hated Rhona Mittra she tried to be the next Kate Beckinsale from Underworld and the next Milla Jovovich from Resident Evil. This movie has the worst anti heroine. Neil Marshall put a live rabbit and it was blown to pieces with a machine gun for nothing. This movie has nudity f*** this! I don't understand the love and the praise this underrated movie gets and I never will! This STINKER movie is way overrated Neil Marshall made Dog Soldiers one of my all time favorite werewolf movies and that movie get's the hate for it. Dog Soldiers is way better movie then this. I will rather watch Dog Soldiers then this peace a s**** movie! The Descent is way better movie then Doomsday I watch it last night and I have enjoy that movie better then this. Doomsday suck a dick! It is not a good movie it stole so much elements from other movies that is not just worth of watch! This movie can not be original! Why is Dog Soldiers and The Descent original and this isn't?!This movie fails to be also a good sci-fi film it has action? A terrible poorly paced action Rhona Mittra is so terrible at her fighting skills that I was laughing my ass off. Omg this movie has Malcolm McDowell in it from Rob Zombie's Halloween remakes and he is the dark knight in this movie are you kidding me? The acting is wooden from everyone, everyone in this movie is a brainless moron! Point me one actor that is good in this movie? Lee-Anne Liebenberg died in a few scenes and she failed miserable to be the second villain. Craig Conway imitates The Humungus (Kjell Nilsson) from Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior. You know these British directors does not know how to make a good post-apocalyptic action movie! I don't like Neil Marshall's movie Doomsday that's my opinion I have seen this movie two times in the row and the second time around I couldn't finish because it has so bad clichés in this movie. I dislike Rhona Mittra a lot she is the worst actress ever! Movies I will rather watch then this crap: Escape from New York, Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior, Mad Max, Mad Max: Fury Road, Cyborg, 28 Days Later, Army of Darkness, Lord of the Rings, Resident Evil, Underworld, Underworld: Evolution, Underworld Awakening and Underworld: Blood Wars MILES way better movies then this overrated trash! I am avoiding all Rhona Mittra's movies she is in it including Underworld: Rise of the Lycans, so terrible horrible sh*** actress she is and she can not act! Score F 1/10 failed miserable avoid like a plague unless you like brainless violent offensive copycat action movies! This movie is a retarded stupid overrated peace a s**t movie!!!",Doomsday

She is sent back in to the forbidden zone with an elite team to see if there had been a cure found or any sign of life. They find savagery, devastation and rogue gangs ruling the land.

78,Superunknovvn,A fun but deliberately dumb movie with nothing original,6,27 August 2008,"Like Greg Mclean, director of ""Wolf Creek"" and another great white hope for the horror genre, Neil Marshall followed a very promising horror flick with a deliberately trashy project. Where Mclean directed his attention to a murderous crocodile, Marshall took a bow to two of his favorite movies, ""Escape From New York"" and ""Mad Max"". ""Doomsday"" is not just influenced by those two movies, it's practically a mash-up with the female heroine from ""Underworld"" thrown-in. So, the first thing you should forget about when you pop in this movie is originality. Marshall makes no excuses for paying homage to his heroes George Miller and John Carpenter (hell, he even named two characters in this movie after them).Like ""Escape From New York"" and ""Mad Max"", ""Doomsday"" demands a lot of suspension of disbelief to be enjoyable. However, maybe sci-fi flicks could get away with more stupidity in the 80's or maybe Marshall's movie is just extra dumb. Sometimes it seems like the director wasn't even trying to fill plot holes or avoid laughable action scenes. If you're looking out for mistakes in ""Doomsday"", you'll find plenty to complain about.So, no, this isn't the high profile follow up one would have wished for after the dense, claustrophobic ""The Descent"". On the other hand, ""Doomsday"" doesn't fail to entertain. It's fast paced and charmingly old fashioned. Who else dares to come up with a post-apocalyptic world in which punks and knights rule the country in this day and age? Marshall's love for the project is somehow transmitted to the viewer and actually gives you a very pleasant feeling.If you're able and willing to turn off your brain, ""Doomsday"" can be a very entertaining, old-fashioned action movie. It may not be a masterpiece or even a good movie, but it can definitely be seen as a fun little interlude by a director that must not be written off just yet.",Doomsday

Malccolm MacDowell has a small role as a self-proclaimed king of a jerry-rigged fortress in the middle of nowhere. Bob Hoskins is Mitra's mentor. Lots of heads and other bodily parts get lopped off and people are roasted alive then sliced up and eaten. There is a juicy torture scene thrown in for good measure for all you HOSTEL and SAW fans.

And boy is it a lot of fun...and then some! Sure, the plot is a tad ridiculous and the characters are barely developed, but Marshall makes up for this by providing ultra-gory, intense action sequences and fast pace to boot. The Reaper Virus decimates Scotland in 2008, and this ends up with Scotland being walled off from the world. Skip to 2035, and the virus has reached London, which causes the government to send a squad of specialists, led by Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) into Scotland to retrieve a cure from a crazed doctor, Kane (Malcolm McDowell). However, when they get through The Wall they find the survivors are unwelcoming, and what follows is a battle for survival against cannibalistic madmen.First and foremost, Doomsday is incredibly over the top. How, you may ask? Well, we witness a soldier barbecued and eaten, cows being squashed by tanks, a gladiator battle, many people crushed by cars and plenty of bodily mutilation including impalement and decapitation. Marshall, coming off of the successes of cult werewolf film Dog Soldiers and caving-gone-wrong movie The Descent, knows how to direct (writing...not so much). Unfortunately, I don't think people knew what to expect, so they just assumed it was another Descent. This may be why it was trashed by many critics and was not a huge box-office success. Obviously, the tone is very light-hearted and referential and he succeeds in doing this. Honestly, I got sucked in from the beginning and found myself intrigued and tense the whole way through.Of course, the film is not perfect. As mentioned previously, the story is not great (nor is the dialogue). The acting is passable, I actually think Mitra is a great heroine and a decent actor. Bob Hoskins and Malcolm McDowell provide excellent support but none of the other actors are true standouts. Overall, I would recommend this film to people who want a thrilling and well-made post-apocalyptic action film that is almost a modern day Grindhouse flick.3½/5",Doomsday
86,raypdaley182,Britain infected again?,2,4 May 2008,"OK the plot is nothing you haven't seen before in 28 Days Later or 28 Weeks Later. A killer virus infects & kills lots in Scotland (incidently, the film jumps the shark in th opening 3 minutes with the soldier opening fire on automatic - just not how British Troops are trained at all), martial law is declared. Scotland gets sealed off & all seems OK until some infected are found in London.The mayor of London (Alexander Siddig of Deep Space 9 fame) calls his chief of police (Bob Hoskins) to send a team into Glasgow to look for survivors & a possible cure so they won't have flood some of London to kill these newly infected. And this team will be lead by? Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra, Hollow Man & former Lara Croft model).Eden certainly looks & dresses quite a lot like Jill Valentine from the 2nd Resident Evil movie & I'm sure that's not by accident either. I can see why people have likened this to Escape from New York (the wall around a place, the lead character carrying a GPS device to enable tracking, the general population kept ignorant of the mission, a society of anarchy inside the wall).With the scenes of the troop getting ready for the mission in the hanger it was very much like bits on Aliens prior to planet fall. Even though we're clearly told the people inside the wall have become cannibals that fact is completely destroyed when the APC knocks down & kills a cow and has to drive through a field of at least several hundred cows so the films own logic has become highly suspect that the writer can't remember something they told the audience only a few minutes earlier.The search mission inside the hospital almost mirrored the search inside Hadleys Hope from Aliens. Although I must admit the people attacking them in the hospital did have a touch of Mad Max styling about them (very lazy being unable to come up with something new themselves I felt!).There's even a nice nod back to 80's TV series Max Headroom at 1 point. I'm a bit annoyed that the windows of 1 APC are broken so easily, it shows poor writing in needing to hurry the plot forwards. Both seemingly impregnable APC's are destroyed WAY too easily. It's an incredibly lazy writer who set up such seemingly tough vehicles then throws them away to such simple attacks. The fact that the idea is also lifted wholesale from Aliens shows you exactly how little the writer actually did.The musical scenes in the hall (the entire scene was basically BarterTown stolen wholesale from Mad Max 3) were another very good indicator the writer didn't do much when creating what little script they actually did write themselves. 3 songs to fill almost 10 minutes of screen time (where nothing happens, nothing is explained & the plot is not enhanced in any way, shape or form) just to avoid having to write anything original it seemed to me.We're told the guy leading the insane gang in Glasgow is the son of Kane (Malcolm McDowell) the Scientist that Eden has been sent to find. And the girl she rescued as she escaped is his daughter.The whole ""holed up in a castle"" is very surreal (pretty much like Army Of Darkness so yet another stolen idea), almost like it was an idea picked at random & then just done because nothing else had come to mind. Meanwhile back in London the infected were over running the city & The Prime Minister got infected blood on him & killed himself.As for the outcome of the ""Gladiator"" scene? It was nothing if not 100% predictable. Likewise with the evil Minister in charge & Hoskins told to stay behind while they go to pick up Eden & the cure there was bound to be some sort of twist or betrayal about to happen near the end.The road action sequence at the end is pretty much bits of Mad Max & Mad Max 2 but after that you at least know the leader of the Glasgow gang is most definitely dead.Eden not going back with the survivors & being found by Hoskins is a bit of a weird scene. I assume her throwing the head back at the gang is her way of telling them she's running Glasgow now (having given Hoskins the video evidence to bring down the evil Minister) but it's a very weak ending & far too open but not a good enough film to warrant a sequel.",Doomsday
87,LazySod,A compilation of blatantly stolen stuff,5,23 May 2008,"When an amazingly strong virus breaks out in Scotland the only logical thing is done: to limit the loss and keep the virus from spreading any further the country is sealed off from the rest of the world. Its surviving inhabitants are left to die and are quite naturally not entirely happy with that. When years later the same virus reappears, this time in central London, containment is no longer an option and someone is sent into the now barren Scotland to search for a cure.So far so good. The film starts rolling and it's clear from the very start that it doesn't invent anything new - it just rehashes scenes taken from several other films, clinging on to the old motto: ""better to steal a good thing than to invent a poor one"". This is an acceptable motto if the thief applies some changes to the stolen bits and actually improves them. Quite sadly this film only changes the stolen scenes for the worst.There are some good bits in it, there are some mediocre bits in it, but the bulk of the film is just rather bland that might be enjoyable for people that did not see the films this one has stolen from but that are not really any good for the people that did see these other films.5 out of 10 stolen tapes of celluloid",Doomsday

89,Shattered_Wake,"'In the land of the infected, the immune man is king!'",7,15 June 2009,"Neil Marshall is a fantastic director. I can't deny him that. 'Dog Soldiers' and 'The Descent' are two of the best horror films of this decade. And he's on the short list of people in which I have hope to change the future of the horror genre to prevent it from continuing as it is now. I believe he will be considered a legendary director in a few years and rightfully so. But, to be honest, I'm confused about this film and I'm hoping that, by the time I complete the review, I'll have worked out all my thoughts and be able to score it appropriately.The story involves a worldwide plague called The Reaper Virus which infects, deforms (with hideous boils and such), and then kills the host. It's shown as starting in Glasgow, then spreading outwards. So, as most would do in an extreme situation, the government and military takes extreme action. . . granting martial law and quarantining the entire infected area and then sealing away the infected to be forgotten. The opening scene is intense and brutal, one of the best in recent memory. And it really sets you up for what should be an amazingly powerful and vicious film. Does it deliver? Well, if I told you now, you wouldn't really need to read the rest of the review, would you? Oh, don't worry, it's not that long.It's 27 years later (ooh, so close to being a sequel to Danny Boyle's phenomenal film, huh?) and we meet our hero, Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra): a one-eyed soldier/spy/operative/etc.. Now, you may be wondering. . . one-eyed? Yeah, I was curious about that too. When searching for the ideal candidates for high-risk situations risking the lives of not only the soldier herself, but the others on the mission with her, and quite possibly, the lives of others far, far away. . . would you really choose someone with only one eye? It's curious, and while it makes for an interesting storyline (especially since her removable eye is actually a camera which transmits to her watch to peek around corners, under doors, etc.), it just seems a liiiiittle bit strange.Anyway, Major Sinclair is sent with an, umm, adequate team to cross the wall into the infected city to search for Kane (Malcolm McDowell), the leader of quarantined Scotland who may have the cure for The Reaper Virus, which is back and ravaging London. After crossing the wall, Sinclair and her team are attacked by, what appears to be, a strange cross-breed of The Lost Boys from 'Hook' and the bad guys from 'The Road Warrior,' armed with maces and Molotovs. Eden is captured and brought to the fortress of the awesome Sol (Craig Conway). It's at THIS POINT where the film takes a turn. And it's not really a good turn, at least not for me.The film started out with this dark and violent mood to it and it continued on for a damn good bit. . . but once we're brought to the land of the, for lack of a better word, Punks, the film becomes a bit too over-the-top, cheesy, and annoyingly unrealistic. I mean, a friggin' beat-up old cop car chases down and beats out a brand new Bentley. And Eden talks on a cell phone right out of the box, no activation or anything. I can suspend my disbelief, but c'mon. . . that's just a nuisance, there.As the latter half of the film progresses, it gets more and more over-the-top. There are Michael Bay-style explosions all over the place, insane car chases, and a weird mix of a Medieval-looking land where people are running through the forest with bows & arrows and the futuristic society full of crazy Punks in tricked-out buses. Actually. . . the latter part is kind of cool. It was kind of like hopping from a Renaissance Festival to a Mad Max convention. So, I'll let that slide. It was still a little awkward.When it comes down to it, it is a cool flick. The first half is outstanding, full of brutal violence, gore, and massacres. And, while the second half has that as well (trust me, the gore and violence does NOT stop at all), the mood changed far too much to keep it as the intense apocalyptic thriller it could've (and should've) been and that's what ruined it a bit for me.So, for that, I'll have to give Mr. Marshall and 'Doomsday' a 7.5/10.-AP3-",Doomsday

The British government has built a 12 foot steel wall the whole length of the Scottish/English Border in super quick time, so that nobody can get in or out and so the Scots can rot away to their hearts content. 20 years later in London and there is another outbreak and so the government is forced to act, they know that there are still survivors beyond the wall and so they send a crack team of experts in, to find out if they possibly have immunity and to find the mysterious Dr Kane a scientist they believe might have been working on a cure. The leader of this expedition is Maj. Eden Sinclair, a one eyed woman who as a child had been saved by soldiers at the last moment before the wall closed for the last time. her motives are to see her family home and perhaps find her mother.Like all films by Neil Marshall this latest effort came with a great air of expectancy, so does it deliver?well it does and it doesn't. Its an apocalyptic tale along the lines of 28 days Later, but it soon spreads its wings and delves into many genres and plucks with its plagiaristic fingers ideas at will from many films. The overall feel of the film is a hotch potch of ideas, one gets the notion that Marshall doesn't have an original idea of his own at all. What is it about the future, that when all law and order has gone and people are struggling to live, find food and drink, some shelter not to mention avoiding a deadly virus etcrational thoughts desert them and the first thing they want to do is build a car or a hotrod motorcycle with skulls on it?.well I'll tell you why, because they need transport to the local Cyber Punk Hair Salon, where they all queue for hours with photographs of their favourite member of Sigue Sigue Sputnik and discuss the merits of Adam Ant's Kings of the Wild Frontier, where they also tell the stylist ""I want a Mohican like that...oh and could I have it in bright pink please? damn all out of bright pink, How about luminous aquamarine or cerise? Not only that, but they also live in Glasgow, I don't know if any of you have been to Glasgow, I have many times and its Effing freezing, so why do they all the men go around bear chested and all the ladies wear leather bikinis or less? Maybe its because they are at war with the devilish Dr Kane, who lives in a big Castle, where all the men wear suits of armour and all the ladies have wee lace bonnets and dress like old hags? One thing about a deadly virus it always gives people bad dress sense.Marshall has made his own bed here and must take responsibility for a lack of imagination, I believe he has stated he wanted this one to be ""for the fans"", so they could ""guess the films he was homaging"", but it can't take away from the fact that he has single handedly stolen ideas from Mad Max, Escape from New York, 28 days later, Ivanhoe, Gladiator, Indiana Jones and a host of other genre films. So enough of the good things and on to the bad, oh I mean good, Well the film wastes no time in getting going and it goes along at a fair old pace, so fast you don't always have time to turn your eyes to heaven and tut. The special effects are really good, as are the fight scenes and the driving/chase scenes, the acting is a little stilted though, (ooops I'm back on the negatives again...oh well) the dialogue doesn't fare much better. From my comments you might think I hated this film....I didn't, I don't know why but somehow against my better judgement, I actually enjoyed it, its escapism and fantasy on another level, its not great by any means but if you want a mindless entertainment for a couple of hours, this one fit's the bill. 6/10",Doomsday
93,eventlaunch,Good movie but could have been great,6,17 July 2019,I guess this didn't take off as a franchise by not performing at the box office this is mainly because they kill off all the likeable characters put too much emphasis on villains and not enough care to end the movie with some final pay off conclusion,Doomsday
94,shanayneigh,So unique!,4,19 July 2008,"I think it started off great! It had a great vibe in the beginning, and I really like the first 30 minutes or so, but it's all downhill after that. It's a pity, because it could have been a great film.I think the main problem is that they run into (and get captured by) the survivors way too fast, thereby ruining the tension that had been building up to that point. And when the main villain is a wildly screaming idiot I quickly lose any interest I had until then. And don't mention the loooong scene of the survivors at the heathen party dancing to Fine Young Cannibals (pun intended, I'm sure).What's truly astounding is that the director doesn't seem to have developed his own vision of what the future looks like. It seems kins of cliché that people in a dystopian future are sporting mohawk style hairdos, clownish makeup and fetishwear. John Carpenter and George Miller could very well sue the director of Doomsday, because it's a carbon copy/rip off of Escape from New York and the Mad Max trilogy, with a whiff of Lord of the Rings-style fantasy that comes straight out of left field. OK, you're immune, but why the medieval style clothing? It's really a shame.",Doomsday
95,januszlvii,Excellent Movie,8,27 October 2020,"Doomsday is an excellent Science Fiction Film. If you like the Alien, Resident Evil and Mad Max movies you will enjoy this. Rhona Mitra plays Major Sinclair a woman who leads a team into Scotland in search of a cure for the Reaper Virus ( a virus that first happened over 25 years ago and Sinclair was a survivor of this). What really makes the movie work is a very unexpected outcome which is: 1: What is the cure? 2: Who survives besides ( spoilers ahead) Sinclair. 3 : What actually happens to her. Besides Mitra you get an excellent performance from Malcolm McDowell as Kane a former researcher who becomes a King Lear type ruler in Scotland, Craig Conway as his estranged son Sol who is the leader of a band of outlaws, and MyAnna Bunding who plays Kane's daughter Cally who teams up with Sinclair and her team and plays a huge role when it comes to the cure. Again an excellent movie. 8/10 stars.",Doomsday

97,Jacques98,An action movie . . . that's about it.,1,2 September 2008,"For nothing but a pure mindless action movie, it's better than a lot I've seen. I think I may even consider this to me Neal's most mature movie, if not his best.First: It's a lot bloodier than your standard action movie. It's not quite as bloody as The Decent, but it's about twice as bloody as Dog Soldiers. I think the only comparison I can make as far as the blood level would have to be The Hills Have Eyes and Death Sentence. None of them are cringe-worthy, but they're a lot more ballsy than your normal action flick.Second: Yes, most of the movie pays homage to other movies. Aliens, Sin City, Gladiator, Mad Max, 28 Weeks Later . . . and a lot more that I probably didn't even pick up. But to call this movie ""genetic"" is retarded. The main premise is generic, yes. The way it's executed is something that I've never seen done before. Generic originality, if you will.But I can't forget how dull so much of the film was. A lot of it was well done and entertaining, but other parts of the movie were just too bland, and could have easily used a 15-minute cut.In the end, I think this is by far Neal Marshal's most mature movie from a technical standpoint. I was never a fan of The Decent, simply because it was too cliché for me, and Dog Soldiers was too low budget for its own good. I think Neal is now one of the directors to watch for.1/10",Doomsday
98,pinkliz41,Your in for one hell of a ride!,8,2 September 2008,"Doomsday is a post-Apocalyptic thriller that delivers high on the action and violence. It's a 'B' movie done right, thanks to its director Neil Marshall and superb cast. If you will, think of it as Mad Max meets Gladiator. And it's style and skill fully displays this. This is by far not a film to be looked down upon. By all means it's great entertainment that lets you shut down your brain, look and enjoy! Marshall demonstrates his power to make a good film. OK, maybe leave the directing and acting out of it but what he sculptures out of the final version is full on excitement, thrills and action.By all means go and watch it, but don't expect an Oscar worthy film. Just go in, switch your brain off and enjoy.",Doomsday
99,Ric-7,Unwatchable,2,27 March 2008,"I can't disclose any spoilers because I didn't stick around to see the ending.The beginning is very promising, in which I honestly thought that there might be some actual character development, as the characters are presented with dilemmas and display some actual human emotions that a viewer might identify with. Bob Hoskins appears briefly, giving a hint that this might actually be a decent film. I was gravely mistaken.Bob Hoskins disappears, and instead there are endless under-lighted scenes of near-cartoonish ultra violence--such as various living targets exploding in bloody spurts as they are shot, and armored troop carriers running over people in grisly detail. It was all extremely gross, but it was also very boring. After I started to doze before the end of the battle, I decided I could sleep better at home. Passing a serious car wreck on the way home would probably have provided me with similar but superior entertainment.The last 45 minutes of this film may be the greatest stuff since Citizen Kane, but I'll never know. If you like scenes of realistic butchery and torture, you should not miss this film. At least you won't be called a rubbernecker.",Doomsday

As years go by, people in the safe zone (south) begin to catch the virus, and the leaders discover people up north, so they feel there must be a vaccine against the virus.They send Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) and some doctors to retrieve the cure, which they believe has been found by Dr. Kane (Malcolm McDowell).Once they cross into the north, they come into contact with a band of rogue civilians who are more animal than human, then they run into a bunch of Mideval warriors, all in search for a cure.This was definitely NOT one of the best apocalyptic movies made in the last ten years. The storyline is contrite, the acting is wooden and shallow, and most of the movie makes no sense. They go from a band of futuristic cannibalistic warriors with purple and green Mohawks to people playing Mideval warriors dressed in traditional Mideval garb. All-in-all it was a highly disappointing film.",Doomsday
101,Indyrod,Neil Marshall delivers the goods again...,8,21 August 2008,"What a hell of a fun ride this Neil Marshall film is, and he continues to generate top of the line genre films, regardless of genre. I watched obviously the unrated version, and the story concerns a lethal virus that hits Scotland, and spawns the English to build a wall completely across the country keeping out the poor Scots who the English assume are dying off. But 30 years later, a wondering Scot is seen with the virus and sparks the English to go beyond the wall to find a scientist that might still be alive and might have a cure to the virus. This is kind of along the lines of ""Escape from New York"" and several other movies, but to be honest, I like this story better. This crack team is led by a tough as nails and very hot female that takes no prisoners as they fall into the grasp of the now cannibal population led by a hilarious character named Sol. This guy is a trip, and had me laughing out loud, as he seemed more like a rockstar than a leader of cannibals. This unrated version is brutal as hell, with some outstanding gore and extremely graphic cannibalistic scenes, especially one in which a guy is hung upside down over a fire and cooked with the cannibals slicing off their favorite pieces for consumption. Yes, this movie has a BIG sense of humour along with the fun and nasty story and very very graphic effects. This is now a favorite movie of mine of all recent viewings, and Neil Marshall is doing nothing less than getting better and better with three straight exceptional movies, ""Dog Soldiers"", ""The Descent"", and now ""Doomsday"".",Doomsday
102,BigGuy,Haven't I seen this before?,6,16 March 2008,"I won't be the first and I won't be the last to say that this movie borrows heavily from other movies of the genre. There is a strong feeling of Escape from New York about the whole movie, or maybe it was Escape from LA. Apparently anytime you put up a wall and keep everyone from going in or out, everyone inside turns into punks. Apparently even 25 years later you can find hairspray and pink dye.Oh, and there is a definite Mad Max feel at times. There were also way too many plot holes. Normally I'm pretty oblivious to plot-holes, but these are big enough to drive a bus through, or at least a Bentley Continental. Seriously, how could a mint condition Bentley not be able to outrun a police car that's been in the hands of punks for 25 years? Anyway, if the writer, director, etc. had taken enough time to actually think about these things, it could have been a pretty good movie. But no, they went for whizzbang excitement and doomed the movie for mediocrity.",Doomsday

The gore-factor is high, being extremely violent. The acting is bad, I mean, really, really...BAD. Rhona Mitra does her best with a one-dimensional character and Bob Hoskins, Adrian Lester and Malcolm McDowell are hilarious in their respective roles! South Africa stands in for Scotland and (note to the South Africans) there are several Spot-the-South-African moments, notably stunt woman Lee-anne Liebenberg who takes a substantial role in the movie and local funnyman, Cokey Falkow.

104,mirwais-orbit,"Maybe ridiculous, but an interesting action thing",9,21 December 2008,"Like Dave White says on his review, this movie is all about action and gore and it has anything you can imagine. Pick up your favorite thing of any action movie... Yeah, it has.Neil Marshall is the director of this sci-fi-thriller-epic. He's also the director of The Descent (2005), an incredible thriller with great tastes of horror with an outstanding grand finale.Of course that Doomsday is not so refined like his previous movie, but while the The Descent is all about technical perfection, Neil Marshall seems like just having fun here, and that's what makes this movie so enjoyable, because it's thrilling without being intelligent, it's funny without being crappy, it's frightening without being predictable and also predictable without being unpleasant. It's a very uncommon action movie that brings us back to great references in action movies thru the years since the 80's. It could have been a huge mess, but it actually works. It starts as an horror movie like 28 Days Later, then it becomes a sci-fi movie with tastes of Alien, bring us great remembers of Mad Max, passes thru dungeons tales and ends up like The Transporter. Right to the point: Neil Marshall is not afraid to dare and play with clichés in action movies over the decades.Doomsday has some resemblances to his previous movie: it's all surrounded by a female character; the main character has to deal with ""things"" that somehow survived in a stark place and the characters has to deal with extreme conditions.The main character is performed by Rhona Mitra, an actress who is gradually gaining prominence and more interesting major roles mainly in action movies. And she deserves it. Specifically in this movie she is a bad-ass woman with heroic intentions but politically incorrect, which makes her character well edged with an interesting appeal, giving to the audience fair reasons to keep their attention always on her and thrill with every moment she gives. The movie is all about her, and Rhona Mitra was a good choice for the role because she has all the qualities and flaws that fits perfectly to the character.If you like action movies but it's not worried to dare something a little different from what is being produced in the last few years, this is an excellent choice. It's not something that you will keep remembering for a good time like the movies that became references to this one, but it's something that you will enjoy (a lot) for a few hours.",Doomsday
105,kevin_crighton,An absolute blast!,7,10 May 2008,"What happens if you toss The Mad Max trilogy, Escape From New York, Aliens, post-apocalyptic movies, 28 Days Later into a mix? Answer: Doomsday! In 2008, a virus known as Reaper tears through the population of Scotland. The UK government decides to seal off Scotland completely, and walling the population in, leave them to die. In 2035, it's discovered that the virus has hit the city of London. When it's revealed there are survivors in Scotland, a mission is launched to find a cure, at any cost....Niel Marshall, the writer and director of Doomsday follows up The Descent (a brilliant horror movie) with this homage to some of his favourite movies. In a way, you could look at this as a similar movie to Death Proof or Planet Terror, the Grindhouse experiment from Tarantino and Rodrequiez. However there is one clear difference - Marshall has written a far better movie! Unlike Death Proof (haven't seen Planet Terror), where Tarantino homages the Grindhouse movies of the past, Marshall doesn't keep having his characters TALKING about those same movies. Instead, the references are there to spot, but he doesn't keep battering you over the head with them! Although the cast are pretty good, with an excellent lead performance from Rhona Mitra, as Eden Sinclair the woman in charge of the mission, this movie is really about spectacle, action, and gore. Lots of gore! Marshall doesn't hold back when it comes to the violence. Heads are cut off, squashed, battered in lashings of blood, and most of the other deaths are pretty similar. It's quite refreshing to see a British movie take on the world with a movie like this and hold it's own.The soundtrack like the movie itself homages the movies from the past, as well as using tracks from the 80's, and the fit the movie well.My only criticism, and being Scottish is the reason I noticed this, is that you can clearly tell that most of the movie was not shot here. This is most clearly evident during the climatic car chase scene. It didn't spoil the movie, and in fact didn't mind the premise. I mean it looks like we have a blast after getting cut off from the rest! As I said, not the most original movie, but certainly bloody good fun!",Doomsday

Aside from the low budget, boring ass beginning, the rest of the film comes complete with two old armored cars driving through junk yards,and cheesy Mad Max crazed warriors. Later we even get medieval style castles filled with old Scottish Occupants. Blended in are elements of Escape from New York, 28 Days Later, and lots of other cheap sets, boring dialogue and girls in bikinis gyrating to the beat of ripped-off pop songs. There is nothing original in the movie. As for acting and story​, forget it! There is nothing worthwhile for the viewer.

This is a action/apocalypse movie fans fix of the month. There is a simple story but it is there just to set up each set piece of violence and it does that well.The characters are actually quite likable on all teams and as I said earlier the acting is strong enough to get you in and keep you there.I had a great time watching this and would recommend it to anyone who likes MAdmax/escape from new-York quality of movies.Beer, popcorn and a frame by frame on the remote to see how they blew that guys head off and you are set.

The powers that be decide the antidote is in the now-quarantined Scotland and send in Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) and a bunch of red-shirts to recover it.The acting is mostly crap all around. Bob Hoskins must need money very badly. Rhona Mitra is too bland for words. She's just inhumanly cocky and wooden. There should be laws against this level of inability to act. I just plain didn't care about any of what happens. Nothing in the movie gave me a reason to care, plain and simple.There is so much wrong with this movie I could write a paper on it. It rips off Mad Max, Aliens, 28 Days Later, Braveheart, Underworld, Resident Evil, Spartacus, The Warriors.... If there is a movie on earth that you cherish, this movie has eaten it and digested it and flushed it down the toilet. It could be brushed off as an homage, but homages are usually not supposed to be the meat of a film. There is literally not an original thought in Doomsday's head, except the heroine has a removable eye, which is gross, and pulls it in and out again as a mini camera, which is improbable. Also it's probably the only time you'll ever see gladiator combat, cannibalism, horseback riding and motor racing in the same movie unless someone does ""Genghis Khan takes on NASCAR"". The aforementioned combination, however awesome it may seem on paper, is g.d. retarded in execution.Next, this movie is violent. It's very violent. I love action films, zombie films, horror films and this was too much. There's no style to it, just unending brutality. For god's sake, at least leave the bunnies and cows alone! It's fitting, if depressing, that Malcolm McDowell should appear in this because I was reminded painfully of the part in A Clockwork Orange where his character Alex is forced to watch unceasing images of appalling violent quality. It's how I felt. I felt occasionally sick. Doomsday is senselessly disgustingly and unceasingly violent. I'm dismayed that director Neil Marshall (of The Descent, which I loved) could have put his name on this with no shame. I'm giving Doomsday an F. Ugh.",Doomsday

Well, except for the fact that EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the wasteland has perfect teeth, is sexy & beautiful, happens to be a punk, and wears perfectly done makeup on a completely clean body.

In this case, one that goes on and on, filling you in on the back-story. Film is a visual medium. If the director cannot set up the film without a lengthy spoken intro then he is not much of a director in my humble opinion.But if you can stomach the spoken intro, can you also be expected to swallow the rest of the preposterous opening nonsense: A wall has been erected surrounding Scotland in its entirety, one that is capable of containing the entire Scottish population and all constructed in the time it took for a rampant, deadly virus to appear and spread??? No, I don't think so either! Rhona Mitra plays the lead role as if she's channeling Kate Beckensale and, indeed, she shares Kate's amazing ability to keep one facial expression throughout the entire length of a movie. Bob Hoskins turns up to collect his pay packet. No one else is worth mentioning.I understand the film is meant to be a homage to other films and other film makers. But why? Why bother?

114,Craig_McPherson,"28 Days after Braveheart met Mad Max, comes Doomsday",5,15 March 2008,"There came a point during a spectacular car chase sequence in Doomsday, when the soundtrack shifted from perfectly matched orchestral staccato to Frankie Goes to Hollywood's ""Two Tribes"", that caused me to wince. Immediately I was removed from what had been a gripping ode to action glory and snapped into the reality of wondering how much of this film's budget went up people's noses, as opposed to being put on film.Such is the fate of Neil Marshall's post-apocalyptic big budget B-movie that seems torn between castigating itself and entertaining the audience.Set in the year 2035, roughly 30 years after the Ebola-like Reaper virus began decimating the population of Scotland, forcing the British government to wall the country off in an attempt to contain the bug from spreading southward, Doomsday tells the story of a team of commandos sent into the wastelands to try and find a cure. Spy satellites have revealed that there are folks still alive beyond the wall and discovering why the virus hasn't killed everyone is deemed imperative in the wake of an outbreak in heavily overcrowded London.Marshall, who has risen to reverential status in the oft maligned horror genre for his critically acclaimed Dog Soldiers and The Descent, makes no pretense that he's created a work of high art here. He openly admits that the concept of the film came to him in two stages, after visiting Hadrian's Wall that divides Scotland from England and being struck with the thought of what if such a thing were erected today, coupled with a dream that involved a woman fighting a knight in amour. From there it was only a matter of time before a patchwork quilt of ideas cobbled from other movies began to be thrown against the wall to see which stuck.The end result is a movie that looks and feels like the Highland fling version of The Road Warrior, with Glasgow having fallen into the hands of the mohawked Sol (Craig Conway), the psychopathic leader of a band of tattooed punked-out Braveheart cannibals, and the medieval Camelot-like society that has taken root in a Highland castle at the court of Kane (Malcom McDowell) a government scientist originally working to find a cure for the Reaper virus but abandoned behind the wall when the country was sealed off.From this mix the audience is treated to copious quantities of people being cut down by bullets, knives, axes, maces, grenades, kung fu, impalings and car wreaks. And while it's easy to see why most critics will savage this movie, after all, it practically begs for it, the best advice I can give is this; if you're looking for some terrific action that has been created by good old fashion stunt-folks instead of the ever pervasive CGI, and aren't looking for anything deep except some fun while you munch on your popcorn, then I think you'll find the spirit in which Neil Marshall made this movie.",Doomsday

From Rhona Mitras Snake Plissken eye patch to the splatterpunk villains and their insanely adapted patchwork vehicles for the gloriously cranked up chase sequences, it wears its inspirations prominently and unashamedly on its gore-soaked sleeves.Not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, the whole trip is a blast. It's the sort of movie that barely pauses for breath so you don't really have time to dwell on the sheer blatancy of what it has appropriated from other sources. It moves forwards at pace and there's nearly always something happening. Designed as a high-octane rollercoaster ride - in common with some of the director's previous works (Dog Soldiers, The Descent) - it is best appreciated by just sitting back and going with the supercharged flow.People get killed - beaten, shot, hammered, flattened, stabbed, sliced, diced, disembowelled, blown-up, decapitated, burned, roasted, eaten - with glorious abandon. Crazy comic book mayhem dished up with a sense of black-humoured glee.I get that it won't appeal to all tastes - it's as if the term ""cult item"" was designed specifically for it - but if you like Escape From New York, Mad Max and 28 Days/Months Later - there's every possibility you will get some decent mileage out of this.There's a great cast - Mitra, Hoskins, McDowell, Pertwee, et al - and they acquit themselves with appropriate tonal gravity in regard to the sort of vehicle they are appearing in. It's fun to imagine that when society collapses, we will either become cannibalistic urban punk warriors or medieval feudalists living in a big old castle. Nice that there's a reasonable choice.",Doomsday
116,The_Dead_See,If I ever saw a movie that couldn't decide what it wanted to be... this is it...,5,10 August 2008,"It's tempting to think that the ridiculous inconsistencies in plot, theme, and character motivation that tap dance wildly through Doomsday were intentional, but I fear that may not be the case. There's just too much here that looks like it was *trying* to be good, if you catch my drift, and that makes me suspicious that Marshall was really reaching for something great, but unfortunately missed the mark. The movie jumps randomly from 28 Days Later to Aliens to King Arthur to Gladiator to Mad Max 2 and finally to Escape from New York. It's a frustrating mix that comes across more like a teenage boy's unoriginal wet-dream than a worthy homage. I'm not usually one to knock rip-offs. After all, if you're going to steal then at least steal from the best, right? But the big problem is that almost every scene was done so much better in the original source material that here it comes off groan-worthy and tedious. There are no new spins, no surprises, nothing really to hold the attention.On the plus side, the action scenes are certainly well directed. Marshall ramps up the hyperkinetic directing and gives us much faster pace than his previous movies; but sadly - without making the viewer care about the characters or the plot - the action seems meaningless and empty. Likewise the gore is copious and gratuitous (we watched the unrated version) and should please any bloodhound. But it would have just been nice if it was attached to a better script.This is another weekend renter. Not bad enough to avoid, but not good enough that you'll give a damn about it after the credits roll.",Doomsday
117,Minus_The_Beer,Escape From Thunderdome,7,9 July 2017,"It's ""Escape From New York"" meets ""The Road Warrior"" by way of ""28 Days Later"" in ""Doomsday"". Director Neil Marshall's (""The Descent"") post-apocalyptic homage to the above mentioned (and more) plays it pretty fast and loose with plot and logic, never once slowing down for character-building as it jumps from one wild set piece to another. It's a film that seemingly has no attention span, never feels terribly cohesive, and yet never fails to entertain.It's the year 2035 and a virus has all but decimated Scotland. In an attempt to contain and control the virus, the government builds a wall separating the ravaged country from the rest of Britain. Presumably, they made Scotland's ravaged population pay for the wall themselves. Enter hardened officer Eden Sinclair, as played by Rhona Mitra. Part Sarah Connor, part Snake Plissken, Sinclair (and her faceless team) is tasked with re-entering the ravaged region to hunt down a possible cure for the virus. Along the way, she matches wits with the locals who include but are not limited to a group of ""Mad Max"" rejects and a game Malcolm McDowell (who also provides the film's lengthy expository narration). Butts are kicked and blood is shed, to say the least.Marshall knows what kind of film he is making and he also knows you've seen this film a hundred times before. Appropriately, he takes glee in his film's excess, going full Paul Verhoeven at times in embracing over-the-top gore and laugh-out-loud ultra-violence. This is a film made for the genre fan whose bread is buttered by '80s action, sci- fi and horror. It's pure homage of the highest order; a grindhouse- esque onslaught of tackiness and titillating tension. ""Doomsday"" never quite rises above its source material, and that's OK. As far as mindless, late-night entertainment goes, few modern films get the formula down as well as this glorious cheesefest does.",Doomsday
118,DanLives1980,One fine mess of a John Carpenter tribute.,8,22 August 2010,"I've heard so many people call this film awful; people that liked 28 Days Later, Dog Soldiers and The Descent etc. who should have loved it immediately but then, given a budget, Neil Marshall surpassed his amazing talent for making small but effective horror films with this comic-book science-fiction horror actioner.A simple story about a girl escaping plague-torn Scotland and growing up to be a tough and sexy as hell (one-eyed) special forces arse-kicker leads us into a world where Britain has been devastated by disease and closed off all its borders, leaving everywhere crime ridden, poverty stricken and war torn.Given the opportunity by her mentor (played with style and ease by Bob Hoskins) to return to Scotland to find a cure to the plague which has now entered London, Sinclair heads a crack team of soldiers and scientists head on into a race against the clock, and then a battle of attrition and pure wit against a cannibalistic city tribe and then a society having reverted to a brutal medieval existence.This film will appeal to so many different film fans, which may be why everyone was so conflicted over the resulting film. A Snake Plissken fan may not necessarily be a Mad Max fan but the film is very reminiscent of both Escape from New York and Mad Max 2.The music is very John Carpenter, the settings are as dark as you like and each are reflective of classic scenes from your favourite cult sci-fi films.Most heavily stylised films don't work so well but in this case, glorifying the often raucous Scottish, Geordie and dry English humour makes the most of this film, giving it a unique comic edge that American producers cannot possibly grasp. As a lead villain, Sol is immense in character and energy even though you just want him to suffer and shut the hell up.What also distinctly makes this film purely British is the way the film starts off as a conventional sci-fi thriller, descends into pure comic lunacy and turns into one great big Top Gear advert for Astin Martin. You'll just have to see it to believe it. It's savage, violent, high-velocity, high-impact and very messy fun throughout...I'd recommend this film to most fans of apocalyptic films, fans of comic book-styled sci-fi and early '80's actioners, but only if you don't mind your films absurdly mixed up and without much thought.",Doomsday
119,basilisksamuk,Mindless entertainment at its best,10,2 December 2012,"I am a fan of Neil Marshall's first two films – ""Dog Soldiers"" and ""Descent"" so I was surprised to find that I had somehow missed this film on release. On finding it was on satellite TV I looked up the details on IMDb and was surprised to find a large number of negative comments. For instance Mysticum from Denmark comments on IMDb ""This is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is so fantastically bad, I could talk for hours and hours about each and every little atrociously bad element of the movie."" What could have gone wrong with a big budget film from such a promising director? The first thing to say is that this film is clearly an homage to 80s exploitation films, amongst others, and it references lots of other films such ""Mad Max"",""Escape From New York"", ""Evil Dead"" and any number of zombie movies. You are left in no doubt of the references as even one of the characters is named ""Carpenter."" There are buckets of gratuitous violence, odd glimpses of nudity and a soundtrack that makes the walls of your living room shake. You can expect to see scenes of action, car chases, hand to hand combat, medieval fighting, gladiatorial combat, roastings alive, dancing. You name it and it's there. I have to say that I had a big grin on my face the whole way through the film. I haven't had so much fun watching a movie for a long long time. Yes it's ridiculous, yes it's illogical but that's not the point. This is mindless entertainment at its absolute best.The cast is universally good. Bob Hoskins plays himself, as usual; Sean Pertwee dies spectacularly, as usual; Craig Conway as the crazed punk leader is suitably over the top and Rhona Mitra as the female lead is perfectly cast.So what are all the negative comments on IMDb down to? I can't believe that anyone who lived through all those 70s and 80s exploitation movies could not absolutely love this film. It moves at the speed of a rocket and delivers on every front. One of the detractors suggests it is ""unintentionally hilarious"" but I am sure this misses the point entirely – it would be impossible for Marshall, with the obvious love of the movies he is pastiching here, not to make things intentionally hilarious.I also can't help contrasting ""Doomsday"" with the two ""Grindhouse"" movies ""Death Proof"" and ""Planet Terror"" by Tarantino and Rodriguez as they are all homages to the same back catalogue of ridiculous but entertaining movies. (Marshall himself references Tarantino more than once in ""Doomsday""). I liked ""Death Proof"" better than ""Planet Terror"" but they both came across as clever constructions that referenced earlier films whilst never being as convincing as their predecessors. ""Doomsday"", on the other hand, has no such pretensions or distancing devices. It comes across as a film in which the director and cast are having the most fun it is possible to have and this translates directly on to the screen.Without a doubt a ten star movie.",Doomsday
120,liberalgems,Towards The End I Even Started Cheering! What A Guilty Pleasure!,9,16 March 2008,"I usually avoid blood and guts type films like the plague, but Doomsday is a movie that makes the effort not to take its self too seriously! There are so many hysterically campy moments in this film I was practically jumping up and down in my seat at one point! In Doomsday, you really want the bad guys to lose in a very big way! This is obviously a Mad Max remake. I think it's much better with a woman playing the role as hero. Doomsday also has more complexity. There's three sets of different types of bad guys. And a lot more is at stake this time, its not just the main characters' lives! Sure, I could do without some of the gruesome violence, the reason for 9 stars instead of 10. But I have quick reflexes, and I don't hesitate to close my eyes when the need arises. A good habit to have these days when going to the movies! But unlike so many, many movies, the violence does not ruin the story! You really end-up caring about the good guys! You don't have any mixed feelings. This is a black and white world!

123,InaneSwine,"A decent enough concept, but doesn't meet its potential",5,22 February 2010,"What begins as a decent enough concept - a lethal virus decimates the Scottish population, forcing the government to close its borders - descends fairly rapidly into a pointless exercise in style over content.The film has a somewhat promising beginning, with its chilling shots of the deserted streets of Scotland, and its representation of a government unwilling to help those in need. It also creates a disturbing portrayal of the remaining population, showing their descent from humanity into barbarity, murder and cannibalism. However, director Neil Marshall injudiciously pushes these elements of the plot to one side, making room for a monotonous string of car chases and battle sequences, hindered further by Marshall's poor dialogue read by a collection of flimsy actors, save for Bob Hoskins and Craig Conway who give fine performances.One should not dismiss the film entirely, as the plot is interesting, and there is a handful of scenes that make the film interesting. It's just a shame that Marshall allowed his Hollywood action-flick notions to get the better of him, resulting in a film that fails to accommodate its great potential.",Doomsday
124,robertallenandersonjr,Different from what I expected but in a good way,9,10 April 2008,"Doomsday was a very fast paced action ride. It kept you right on the edge of your seat for most of the movie until the end. I thought that it had many great gore scenes. The cannibal looking people were very crazy and they also ate people as their food to survive. The reason why they eat people and are very crazy is because they were left in a city for several years after the whole city was shut down in the year 2008. I thought that they did a great job with the cannibal peoples make up. They made them look very scary and tough. Rhona Mitra did a great job as well. She played a very tough part which I loved the most about her in this movie. She didn't take any crap at all from nobody. She also looked very pretty as usual. Their was even a couple scenes with knights in it. The knights played a pretty big part in this movie as well. Some of the visuals in this movie were amazing. Especially when they had the car chase scene near the end of the movie. That scene was most likely the best scene of the whole movie. The stunt driving in this was amazing. The stunt performers were at their best in this movie. I also noticed that a lot of people didn't like this movie. I can understand why they didn't, mostly because it was very weird and kept going from different place to another. I thought that was pretty cool though. One part about this movie I didn't like was that Rhona Mitras part didn't show a lot of emotion. This movie was very bloody and gore so if you don't like those kind of movies stay away from this one. Their was also some nudity in it as well. I don't really think that the nudity was really needed that badly. This movie did kind of copy off a lot of movies though. That is just one more reason why people didn't like this movie. One thing that was really cool about this movie was that once the action started their wasn't any quiting, it just kept going. The first 20 minutes of this movie was a little boring. The reason why it was boring though was because it was explaining the story. This movie is not original but it was very good. One last thing I would like to add is that the ending to this movie was very surprising and different. It will probably be talked about a lot. Overall this movie was very exciting and a bloody fun time.",Doomsday
125,Michael Kenmore,"Awful. Completely, stupefyingly awful.",1,9 November 2008,"I sort of enjoyed Dog Soldiers and The Descent (despite a lame ending in the latter), so I picked this movie Doomsday up from Red Box along with Saw IV (which is as awful as the preceding sequels there's no need to comment on that in another review) for a Friday-Saturday night movie enjoyment.The enjoyment is not to be had on a Saturday night when I popped DVD in to watch Doomsday. Right off the bat, the intro opening credit sequence with voice-over narration describing the ravage of the virus is unmistakably reminiscent of the infamous British TV movie ""Threads"" (Google Video it) and, of course, 28 Days Later.I thought, ""This is a ripoff. Yeah, I'll keep watching this, hopeful the story gets better."" But it only gets worse. And with far more outlandish ripoffs than American comic book artist hack Rob Liefeld could muster copying better-drawn panels and claim it's ""homage"". Which the writer-editor-director could use as an excuse for why Doomsday shamelessly copies far superior movies to pass for a B-movie ride.Whereas I despise Alexandre Aja's ""Haute Tension"" for its audacious ripoff of Fight Club ending, Doomsday takes the cake in copying the sheer number of movies not seen since at least ""Armageddon,"" egregious direct to video Corman-lite releases not included.Doomsday is one of the most unoriginal movies I've ever seen. Not that it's the worst movie I've seen -- there are movies so bad it's unbearable to finish viewing. Unlike these movies, I finished watching Doomsday out of fascination how many elements and film ""homages"" I could spot from beginning to the end. How do you count homages? Let me count thee: Threads, 28 Days Later, Escape from New York, Gladiator, Excalibur, Aliens, Mad Max (all three films), Aeon Flux, Cannibal Holocaust, Ultraviolet, The Warriors, and, to a lesser extent, Resident Evil.Neil Marshall is officially a hack director who wrote an incredibly lazy screenplay. If he thought that Doomsday would make for a goofy, frivolous fun, he is sadly wrong. Unoriginality is the norm nowadays, and ""Splatter Pack"" resorts to ripping off as many movies as they can to combine with stomach-churning grisly violence and gore to satisfy their ""Fangoria"" appetite.Where John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper, George Romero, James Cameron and other sci-fi/horror filmmakers strive to make good, entertaining movies in the 70's and 80's, Splatter Pack hacks chose to degrade the quality of modern film-making by ripping off better-made movies with abuse in negligent appreciation for originality or the lack thereof.And that makes them real hacks who got lucky and rich with debut films in theatrical rental and video sales only to make far inferior films because they're too lazy to bother reading books and work on new scripts that bear resemblance of a semi-original idea.Neil Marshall is so shameless in disrespecting other filmmakers that he earns the title of ""Hack"" and therefore do not deserve to belong to the elite club of superior filmmakers - Hollywood, British or otherwise - who can make films with substance that do not devolve in degraded quality relying on the elements borrowed from other superior films. The claim that it's a homage is a paltry excuse to hide the filmmakers' weakness because he's too much of a movie geek and needs to use film as a confessional for his love of films made in the last 3 decades, without much regard for originality to the audience's appalled chagrin expecting semi-mindless entertainment but could not enjoy because they recognize the familiar story elements before and are hence bored crapless.Zero star out of 4P.S. Any film starring Malcolm McDowell post-Clockwork Orange is safely expected to be awful. Tank Girl, Fist of the North Star and Cyborg 3 are examples.",Doomsday

Oh, and throw in a beautiful special forces soldier who knows not only how to use a assault rifle but also a rapier sword before driving a high powered sports car while battling cannibal gang members. Apparently, you call it Doomsday.Scotland, of all places, is devastated by the Reaper Virus in 2008 which quickly kills those who it infects. The British government in London, understandably, wants to contain the situation before the virus spreads and decides to literally cut off Scotland from the rest of the British Isles. Using the plan Rome's Hadrian's Wall, except with steel walls 30 feet high and manned with automated cannons, the Scots are left to face a slow and agonizing death as the population turns on itself once it realizes there is no escape. London, believing that the situations has been contained is willing to leave Scotland as a vast wasteland forgotten by the rest of the world.Decades have past and suddenly the nightmare returns. London, which has remained packed with refugees from the first outbreak who were not infected, discovers the Reaper Virus has appeared in the slums. British Prime Minister John Hatcher (Alexander Siddig) and his adviser Michael Canaris (David O'Hara) realize that the only solution may be the unthinkable. In this they approach the head DDS, Bill Nelson (Bob Hoskins) in sending a team north to Scotland itself on what my be very well be a suicide mission.Nelson believes he has the perfect woman in mind for the mission. Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) is a experience DDS agent who has worked in the slums of London tracking down the worst criminals. When approached by Nelson about leading the mission, Sinclair agrees to go. However, not only out of duty, but also because Scotland was her own home until the Reaper Virus broke out. Only a desperate act of her mother was able to get her across the wall and in doing so the only thing she left her child was a letter with an address. Sinclair knows it's a long shot but perhaps she can find the home she lost so long ago and some answers of her own.Sinclair leads her team across the wall on a mission to find the lost work of a Doctor Kane (Malcolm McDowell) who was working on a possible cure for the virus. However, instead of finding the lost work of Kane, or even an abandoned country, the DDS agents are quickly ambushed by the 80's style British punk rock dressed gang of survivors who enjoy colored hair and leather clothing. Lead by a man named Sol (Craig Conway) the DDS is quickly overwhelmed and only quick thinking by Sinclair allows her to escape. Now Sinclair intends track down Kane himself who is said to still be alive and who could possibly give a cure. That he doesn't is predictable but Malcom McDowell does a good job as a 21st century recluse determined to lead his ""people"" into a 13th century existence (the Braveheart aspect of Doomsday) who uses pop philosophy to explain his sudden hatred towards everything modern. As stated above, Doomsday quickly turns into a montage of various aspects of movies ranging from Resident Evil to Braveheart. The violence is gory, silly, and typical for an over the top action movie the relies on violence to tell the story. One can only wonder why the writer and directer Neil Marshall would want to include so many various extreme scenes and ideas in one movie but, strangely, it works in an amusing way. Doomsday is not a good movie but is one that entertains despite the stupidity that runs through it. 6/10",Doomsday

It really made us laugh groan and cheer at all the references and sight gags.What worried me the most was that this film would be ruined because it did take itself seriously.

If you have never seen any of the films that are referenced, don't feel bad cause you wouldn't need to enjoy this.It's explosive, and bloody, and comical, and flashy, and well mixed with the dry British humour...It's even got a chase scene that would make Jeremey Clarkson and Richard Hammond groan with disgust and delight (maybe more so James May cause it shows off the superior handling, performance, and indestructibility of a Bentley).In the end, secret agent j said it best that this movie could easily be entitled ""don't be a Mad Max, while escaping the Underworld of London 28 day's Later"".Cool film, and will probably buy it on DVD.",Doomsday
128,eve_dolluk,A Unique Action Film Montage with Originality,7,24 May 2008,"Well I started watching this film expecting very little. To be quite honest I though it was going to be Pants. OK so it not a classic or groundbreaking, it can best be described as a montage of previous classics rolled into a crazy humorous flick without actually being a spoof. We start with reference to 28 days/weeks later. We then move to something that resembles Aliens which quickly dissolves into Escape from New York/Mad Max ( Escape from Glasgow style ). Although isn't this what Glasgow is like on a typical Sat night out. The location shots are not bad and u get a feel of desolation that has overcome the city. There is one scene that makes you realise that this isn't a movie to be taken seriously and it makes u smile ( while being gross at the same time ). The Movie takes a turn and it somehow becomes Braveheartesque ( yes i know thats not a word ). We get to see 2 sides to the broken down civilisation, neither are promising.A small reference to lord of the rings and Borimirs death ensues followed by more Mad Max style craziness and a great bad guy death. SPOILER *** Bentley crashes into the middle section of a Bus while decapitating Bad buy and head splatters directly on the camera lens. SPOILER *** yeah kind of cool.The film has many humorous moments without making it obvious and if you have seen Dog Soldiers you will know what I mean.Neil Marshall is unique his films are never to be taken seriously but provide ample entertainment albeit a little tongue in cheek. You could say he is similar to Tarrantino but Marshall has a different more British take on that style. Its a style that I prefer ( probably because I am British ).If u take the Grindhouse movies they really don't compare to this movie ( Tarrantino fans will disagree ) Doomsday is much better, the humour is better the action is better and the characters are more real and believable.I look forward to the next Neil Marshall movie but I hope it is an improvement on Doomsday. OK this had a bigger budget and better Actors but was never as good as Dog Soldiers or Descent ( which was a brilliant Horror/thriller ). This film is Definitely not to be taken seriously but the Pace the humour and the references to other Movies will keep you entertained for an hour and a half. But please whatever you do don't start thinking about the logistics of building that wall. Channel Tunnel and Wembley Stadium come to mind.7/10 not bad for what it is.",Doomsday
129,SimonHeide,Embarrassing experience to watch....,1,12 August 2008,I think that the movie starts out well. The narrative is fine and the atmosphere of impending doom gets through to the audience. At the very moment that we enter the virus-zone the movie falls apart.They are attacked fiercely by a large number of punks and since the team was so unprepared it made you wonder what information they had from the photographs taken from the satellite. They try to escape in their vehicles and somebody smashes the window with a rock or something!? How is this possible as we were told that their armored vehicles could withstand high caliber weapons...? Many obvious flaws in the movie combined with a world in the virus infected zone that is to unbelievable...I can't recommend this movie no matter what.... You will not be able to suspend your critical thoughts when watching this movie.Regards SimonPS. such a shame that Malcolm Mcdowell chooses to appear in this movie.Ps.

Sometimes this kind of homage, frequently, makes the grade as a trivia event but gets sloppy as movie. ""Doomsday"" doesn't, it lights up the screen, in a Tim Burton-ish dark way for the first reels, and can stand alone and proud as its own film. There are 207 entries so this one will never be read but all the previous film references apply: ""Escape From New York"", ""Road Warrior"", ""28 Days"", as well as Romero's Zombie films (in a scene played out in ""Doomsday"" but spoken in ""Escape From New York"" - ""Somebody had him for lunch""). That may not be an exact quote but it's real close. There's also snippets of ""Resident Evil"", some ""Blade Runner"" thematics and I was reminded of a scene or two from ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"". Like I said, the embedded game is to find all the referenced movies in the film. Sometimes it's just a line, a scene (slithering tongue),sometimes it's plot.

131,andrewmerritt-31652,Resident Evil meets Gladiator,7,8 November 2019,"Doomsday is an apocalyptic film starring Rhona Mitra and directed by Neil Marshall. In 2008, a virus known as the Reaper Virus struck Scotland leaving the government to build a 30-foot wall to quarantine the virus. Thirty years later the virus has struck again and now the government sends a team back into the quarantine zone in search of a cure. I knew nothing about Doomsday so I watched the trailer for it to see what it was about and the trailer convinced me to watch the movie. And while Doomsday has a remarkable trailer, the movie as a whole was average. The movie pays homage to classics like the Mad Max franchise and the Resident Evil video games. And while it tries to be different from Mad Max, it has a hard time figuring out what it is because the first act we have Mad Max and on the second act, it gets turned into something out of Gladiator. I understand what the moral of the story the film is trying to project to the audience, but it could've done better. I juts felt like the writers needed to spend some time editing the script before releasing it in theatres and it felt like something was missing. Not that I found anything wrong with Doomsday as it is very entertaining with basic characters that I didn't find boring. And a script that's basic and easy to digest without it feeling very awkward. To me the problem isn't the plot, the script or the acting, but the people in the quarantine zone. We later find out that everyone in the quarantine zone has turned to cannibalism. And while that makes for interesting characters they try way too hard to be like the crazies from Mad Max instead of being something different. Don't get me wrong they are insane, but when we get to the end, they almost become a joke and a big letdown to what we were building up for. Overall, Doomsday is an entertaining adrenaline fueled ride packed with tons of action from beginning to end. And while Doomsday is entertaining, the writing could've used some editing as I found it very confusing.",Doomsday
132,Phantasm01,A mixed up bag...but a fun mixed up bag!,8,18 March 2008,"Neil Marshall's follow-up to 2006's The Descent truly, honestly is one mixed-up bag. Doomsday is pure cinematic anarchy, but it's chaos that's under control and in the right hands. The film starts off as a deadly virus sweeps over Scotland leaving people and families in disarray. The government is able to contain the outbreak by putting up an impenetrable wall; sealing off the country from the rest of the world. Years later, the government has reason to believe that some may have actually survived the infection and begin wondering if there's a possible cure so they send in a top security force to investigate.Leading the mission is the one-eyed Eden Sinclair, played with sexy machismo by Rhona Mitra, who is basically playing the female version of Snake Plisskin from John Carpenter's Escape from New York (one of the characters is even named ""Carpenter""). In fact the almost the first 20 minutes of Doomsday feels like a straight cover version of Escape from New York; using the same opening title font and 80's synthesizer score provided by Tyler Bates. Once inside the infected zone their team is ambushed by a gang of psychotic cannibal punks, and one of Sinclair's squad is cooked up and served to the gang. Mmm toasty! Some seem to be having a difficult time pinning down exactly what Neil Marshall's film is suppose to be. Is this a rip-off of past B-movies, or a loving homage, or is it something else entirely. Honestly, I'm not even sure what Doomsday is exactly. It feels has if Marshall has gone through a dozen 80's B-movies and taken his favorite elements and mixed them together in one explosively, combustible movie. I think there were a few clever ideas that if you look closely you might find funny (i.e. an emergency exit sign inside a castle?). Marshall stays so true to the essence of the genre that I'm positive he even included some of its flaws; like occasional continuity errors (yes, it's suppose to be funny that that Bentley is practically spotless at the end, after flying through that bus).The film is like the equivalent to a greatest hits album; every 20 minutes the movie morphs into something different; from Escape from New York to The Warriors to Mad Max to Braveheart to Gladiator and ending with a car chase that seems ripped out of The Road Warrior. The film never stops moving and never stops evolving. Sounds incredibly uneven, right? Well it is, and yet strangely it almost doesn't seem to be a major flaw when I think about it. The strangeness of the film's structure is almost an interesting blessing in disguise. I don't think I could very easily defend this film in the traditional sense of ""good/bad"" cinema, but I'll be damned if I wasn't fully entertained for it's entire 105 minute running time, which felt like a quick 20 minutes. I was never bored, or even close to being bored. That's entertainment, and this film could have easily been another 30 or 40 minutes longer and I wouldn't have cared.Doomsday is a film that is cut from the same table cloth as last year's Grindhouse. It may not be refined great cinema, but sometimes a nice sloppy joe can be just as satisfying as prime rib. Doomsday is about having fun, not about making much sense, or all the other things that tend to get in the way of entertainment value. Neil Marshall splatters virtually everything on screen; from cute, little bunnies to a leather-clad gimp, and does so by smashing the pedal to the metal and blazing across genres and cinematic styles and does it with such panache it makes it nearly impossible to not say that I enjoyed the ride, even if it was a familiar, bumpy one. It was a true experience; an exercise in visceral anarchy, both physically and narratively. This isn't the kind of movie you go see because of it's originality, but rather because of it's familiarity. If you love the movies that Marshall loves, then I'm sure you'll have a blast.At a time when studios crank out pointless remakes and disappointing, over budgeted sequels, it's nice to see a movie where a director (with a much smaller budget) can throw just about anything and everything into a single movie and create one crazy-fun ride out of it. Logic put aside, originality temporarily shelved; Doomsday packs as much bang for your buck as anyone has any right to ask for. Shut up. Sit back. And relax. Take a load off and enjoy the ride. It's all that matters in the endjust have fun. Doomsday is pure formula, but it's a proved and tested formula that works. The movie is comprised of the best parts of genre films and compacted into one flick. I'd rather sit through a film like this than have to suffer through a serious-minded attempt by some hack film director to actually remake Escape from New York or The Road Warrior. If you went in expecting a horror movie or a science fiction movie or a movie that was to be taken seriously, then you went to the wrong movie.",Doomsday
133,wynonasbigbrownbeaver,Suffers from an identity crisis but entertaining anyway.,6,18 September 2008,"To summarize, Doomsday is perhaps one of the most eclectic movies I have ever seen. There is some action, some okay acting yet sub par character development with some plot holes in between. Overall it is merely a decent SCI-FI/ACTION thriller.I was a bit disturbed by the lack of foundation of direction shortly after the beginning. Direction was trying to give this an identity and it pretty much struggled throughout. It jumped from different types of scenes and the movie felt like one giant experiment rather than an actual film. Chronologically, it was as if I saw Aliens, The Hills Have Eyes, Mad Max, Braveheart, Gladiator, and then Mad Max again all in 90 minutes of filming.This movie takes place in apocalyptic Scotland. Where you see high tech gear on soldiers and doctors, then you see dingy dark prisons and cannibalism, then you see a scene of Rhona Mitra being chased by motorcyclists with mo hawks, then you see the Scottish high raised hills, then you see the Castle in the Dark Ages with everyone dressed up like the Middle Ages, then you see a battle arena. Then you see another car chase like Mad Max. Talk about confusion...In way it makes Doomsday different, I guess this movie provides a little something for everyone's tastes. The car chase near the end was well produced though a little too comical, and the villains throughout were nice and chaotic looking. The bad guy and his pet gimp just cracked me up.Rhona Mitra, the main character was kind of bland version of Alice in Resident Evil or that Underworld chick. But she did her best to play the part of a character in a somewhat real world situation. That cold face persona almost works every time for the protagonist, but she didn't come across to me as a very likable heroine.Other than the villain, the supporting cast that should matter in Doomsday, don't have any real development.One thing this movie didn't lack, was the risk taking assortment of directing styles, and some spontaneous entertainment. Despite the identity crisis this movie emanates, I recommend this movie probably as a case study on what works in an action movie.",Doomsday
134,cyclone259,Death drives a pale Bentley...,8,2 January 2010,"I love most films of the post-apocalyptic kind and while this isn't EXACTLY post-apocalyptic it certainly fits the bill very well.In a sense it is similar to its predecessors: 28 Days/Weeks Later, The Road Warrior and as some have mentioned, Escape From New York. Doomsday doesn't pretend to set new heights for originality and plays much more as an homage to movies of the genre. Saying that, it has it's own set of quirks, humor and creativity by taking what works from past films and bringing them all together.Is this a perfect film? No. It has some pretty big flaws, but it doesn't attempt to be something it's not. This of course will draw huge criticisms from those who are looking for a giant, over-the-top blockbuster with A-list stars and a billion dollar CGI budget.This has some great, albeit at times, cheesy acting from its cast. Like I said, it 'borrows' hugely from other films of the same ilk: The potentially world-ending virus, finding the cure (and bringing it back) from a quarantined area replete with Mad Max-type punks, the maniacal, self-serving ruler of said backwards and forgotten society, etc.It definitely has some, let's say, stomach churning scenes due to the gratuitous gore and bloodshed. There's lots of action, a load of gore and a lot of 'fun' (fun being very subjective in this case).I rate it high, not because it's the 'best I've ever seen', but because I'd actually had low expectations for it and was completely blown-away by just how creative and (here's that word again) 'fun' it actually was.",Doomsday

136,jfcthejock,A Return To British Horror Madness,9,11 September 2009,"Well what do you expect when the director of both Dog Soldiers and The Descent makes this riveting action horror fest. Rhona Mitra stars in this film much similar to her role in Underworld 3, action woman in all her glory. Violent, macabre and brilliantly vulgar but what do you expect if you have seen Neil Marshall other works then you cannot expect anything other than this you would have been warned off by friends who have seen them.Some great car chases, gun fights and some genuine acting. What more for £8 which was the fare to the cinema at the time to see it, I don't regret paying it. Following homage to classics like New York City, Mad Max and current memorable films such as 28 Days Later you know what to expect if you know these films. You are not disappointed, and if you are then you at least have a rocking soundtrack to it to make up for that.So go and see it, rent it or take a risk and buy it. I bought it on DVD at retail price when it was released, one of the best decisions I ever made.",Doomsday
137,Red_Flag,So this is what happens when you give Neil Marshall a big budget.,4,25 May 2008,"This is one of those films that clearly looked better on paper. Its premise is solid and its characterization and feel is undeniably powerful. Only to promote a horror film through the trailers was practically suicide for the producers. Trust me. This is not a horror film. Doomsday is about as terrifying as a car insurance advert. My only warning is that a lot of blood is being thrown around here.Its lead Rhona Mitra is a powerful presence and therefore a brilliant action woman, easily the best thing going on in Doomsday. It hyperactive, over long and ultimately un-terrifying. Though glimpses of stunning mythology shine through the hazy plot once or twice. Still with scares as ridged as this and only one memorable actor its probably best we leave this to the gore-hounds to do with what they will. Rumours abound that a longer, more considerate film lies on the cutting-room floor sue to studio concerns over the running time leaves a glimmer of hope for those in need of more exploration of the director's undoubtable talents.Three decades after a major country is quarantined in hopes of containing a lethal and highly contagious virus nicknamed ""Reaper,"" signs that the super-bug has resurfaced in a major city prompt desperate specialists to race back into the infected zone to find a cure in director Neal Marshall's (The Descent) miasmic speculative sci-fi thriller. Few could have foreseen the terror that the microorganism known as ""Reaper"" would unleash upon the unsuspecting population, and when terrified authorities quarantined the entire country in hopes of saving the human race, the streets immediately descended into chaos. Thirty years later, the inhabitants of planet Earth think that they've seen the last of the merciless killer disease, but they couldn't be more wrong.When ""Reaper"" reappears more powerful than ever in a major city, an elite group of professionals led by Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) are forced to travel back into the sealed-off country where the virus first broke out in order to create a cure and save humankind from certain doom. Now, as the rest of the world anxiously awaits word of their ultimate fate, Eden and her brave team are about to find out that there is indeed a hell, and they are about to journey directly into its black, envenomed heart. Also in the cast are Bob Hoskins and Malcolm McDowell, as well as a host of of veterans from Marshall's past productions, including Sean Pertwee, MyAnna Buring, Craig Conway, and Nora-Jane No one.For those looking for proof of this directors raw talents go and rents his absolutely brilliant debuts ""Dog Soldiers"" or his even better follow up ""The Decent"". This appears to be a minor but fixable stumble along the road of the directors car=ear. The film might be constantly muffled and always over the top but his talents shone through. You can tell both Marshall and Mitra are better than this.My final verdict? Gore galore. Blood-hounds should be happier but Marshall fans will only be disappointed. It's odd how when you give a director so good at making low-budget films money he seems to manage to screw it up royally. Great ending though.",Doomsday

When a team of experts are sent into rotting Scotland to retrieve a cure for a futuristic virus, they are set upon by a horde of baddies who look like they are performers in Cirque de so Road Warrior. But you can't help but imagine one of them saying ""We're a bit more punk than that!"" When the feminine protagonist is taken prisoner, we're introduced to the villainous game show host, Sol. You know that Sol is a menace to be reckoned with because he's pierced, tattooed, raccoon-eyed and has a neon colored tuft of Native Americanesque hair.

Choreographed chaos ensues when Sol peacocks on stage for an audience of raggedy road ragers who collectively demonstrate that ""Hey, just cuz we're living in dilapidated sludge doesn't mean we can't have fun.""

Its really really funny - over the top and typical Neil Marshall super-gory. Rhona Mitra does a great job as the lead and she even has a fairly funny removable eye/spy camera thing going on. In usual Marshall style the leads are all hot and gutsy women and they hold the film up really well. The post-apocalyptic thing has been done to death but this film doesnt take itself seriously and even invokes a bit of social commentary considering that Scotland gets fenced off while Britain remains virus-free. Watch out for the spazzy evil brother and Malcolm McDowell as he king of his kingdom, complete with ""gift shop"" and ""emergency exit"" signs on some of the doorways.

I'm not sure how exactly what the word for it is but basically the blood and the guts of this film were just awesome. Every time a weapon made contact with flesh or a decapitation happened it was beautiful. Ya, sure that sounds sick of me, but the special effects team on this film at least as far as the gore goes was great. It looked real, as far as I would guess and it was stylishly done. There was also some great actors in this film, the main character not being one of them, I don't know if she played the role to intense or just that the script was a little thin as far as her character development was concerned. The scene where we first see exactly who and what is on the other side ( I don't want to ruin anything for anyone) was great as well, I wished it could have been way longer, the set was great and the number of extras really added to the fear of the scene. One thing that did bother me was Malcolm McDowell's character and where he lived, living out in the country in a castle OK I can buy that but why when the other group is using cars are they using horses and bow and arrows, it just felt weird to go from one extreme to the other, with no explanation to why. So, to sum up, I was surprised by this film in a good way, it was not amazing but it was hell of fun, intense and beautifully gory at times, yes I said that.",Doomsday

I saw it in a criminally tiny Saturday afternoon audience (four people) and we all had a terrific time. Don't expect sense, great acting or original dialogue, just go for the kicks and enjoy. A totally deranged, over-the-top splatfest with hideous viral deaths galore, some of the best post-holocaust punk makeup and chase scenes since Road Warrior, brilliant use of 1980's dance music (Adam and the Ants, Frankie Goes to Hollywood--the placement of Siouxie and the Banshees' ""Spellbound"" and a Fine Young Cannibals track at the punk barbecue is simply inspired), a coliseum battle-to-the-death, a bizarre interlude in a Scottish fiefdom that feels as if the movie took a fast detour into the Shire, and the coolest star turn by a UK car since Harry Potter's posse made one fly. All of it snapping and crackling with so much kinetic energy and wild creative freedom that it's hugely exhilarating. We were still giggling like maniacs an hour after the movie.=) It's just such fun to see a director decide to go full-speed over the edge like this.

146,alanrayford,Comment on Doomsday (2008),6,14 March 2008,"I loved Dog Soldiers. I really liked The Descent. However, as for Doomsday...not so much. It's not that the flick was horrible. It was competently crafted and all that. Yet, as I sat through this movie, which I paid in full to scope, I was hit with a startling realization. I wasn't watching just one movie. I was actually watching Escape From New York, 28 Weeks Later, and the Road Warrior, all cobbled together into one derivative, uneven storyline. Not even video games were safe. The feudal society felt like it was ripped out of an old PS2 game. Seriously, that enormigigantuan, armor clad bloke looked like a boss from the Onimusha Series. I actually found myself hoping that Major Sinclair stocked up on health refills, or at least saved her game, before taking him on.As for the acting, well it was largely bland to okay, at best. But, this was not the actors fault, I feel. Take Rhona Mitra, for example, as the film's main protagonist, Major Eden Sinclair. This character could best be summed up in four words: Snake-Plissken-with-gams. During the movie's 100 minutes, she just seemed to be going through the motions, and what choice did she really have when all she could hope to do was follow in Kurt Russel's footsteps? I'm no genius, but I'm pretty sure he has to have bigger feet than she does. As for the majority of the rest of the cast, I didn't bother to learn their characters names, as I didn't need to. This is because they were mostly interchangeable, unremarkable cannon fodder, and I believe each of them damn well knew it. Even now, I find it easier to call actor Darren Morfitt Spoon, from Dog Soldiers, than by the name of the character he portrayed in this film--and he lived through this one. The only four actors who truly stood out in this production were Bob Hoskins, Alex Siddig, Dan O'Hara, and, of course, Malcolm McDowell. Each of these actors saw fit to truly inhabit their roles, lending them an appropriate amount of weight, but not necessarily depth. I truly hope that, before his next project, Mr. Neil Marhsall rediscovers his own voice. It is breathtakingly original and is exactly what the action/horror genre needs to survive, amidst a deluge of PG-13 fright flicks and J-Horror film remakes. Unfortunately, this latest effort probably isn't going to help much, not when it plays like a cinematic pastiche. It was like watching the smartest kid on the block mix and match different pairs of well worn shoes...and falling flat on his face. Still, all in all, I can't honestly say that Doomsday is asstrocious. There are a few moments of genuine, up front entertainment to be found within. It's just that it's a far cry short of what this fan of the genre has come to expect from this particular creator. Better luck next time,dude.",Doomsday
147,shiftyeyeddog,Fun Hardcore Action... but slightly incoherent,6,31 July 2008,"This may be the biggest budget fan film of all time. Sure, much has been made of all its admitted ""homages"" to other films, but essentially this whole film is just a series of copycat scenes strung together - Escape from New York, The Road Warrior, Gladiator,The Warriors... hell, they even have a guy head-to-toe in leather who is called ""The Gimp"". Almost every scene can be directly traced to another film.Originality (and coherence) aside, it's a fun action flick. It's not afraid to go all-out with its hardcore action and gore, and the stunts are predominantly non-CGI. The story itself is okay, but the movie can't seem to decide its tone, shifting greatly about every 30 minutes. The biggest drawback may very well be its lead actress, Rhona Mitra. They successfully portray her character as a skilled, bad-ass soldier, but she is quite wooden as an actress, and sports one facial expression through the entire film (Not to mention many shots of her suggest the filmmakers seem to think she's way hotter than she is)...as for that ending: PLEASE tell me they aren't going to try to make more of these. As a single film, it's a decent adventure, but I don't see it sustaining more than one.One last note: It's a little odd seeing Adrian Lester playing another of the soldiers.

150,mcw6957,3d times a charm.,7,16 March 2008,Neil Marshall has excelled where so many of my cult heros have failed when given the chance & money to make their magic bigger & bolder. Doomsday raises the flag then levels everything in sight. I think its safe to say to those of you who are pointing out the references made in this film that you have missed a greater more fundamental point. Let me explain by saying know your genre. Marshalls first two films are Dog Soldiers & The Descent which are a tribute more or less to various yet specific genres & directors. So if you followed those two films then you pretty much should know the themes & audience the man is aiming for. Much like Rob Zombie. There are so many impostors right now staking claim right & left (Adam Green James Wan Eli Roth)who are receiving high accolades from the cultish elite of internet gurus who do not in any way shape or form deserve it. I think if Zombie had done what Marshall did with Doomsday with Halloween it would have been an instant classic instead of really really good. Yes Doomsday is basically a remake of Escape From NY & Road Warrior with several other nods sprinkled through out. If they ever remake either in the near future they will I promise pale in comparison to what Doomsday has accomplished here right now. So to sum it up neat & proper. Bob Hoskins was fantastic. Rhona Mitra is not Ripley nor is she some pretty face lost in a haze of CGI. Speaking of CGI man am I relieved to see an action movie with real bad guys not mutant computer creations ahem I Am Legend or really fast zombies or zombies period. The sets were large & expansive. I loved this movie because it had big balls and genuine intentions that did not leave me feeling ripped off as I exited.

154,JWJanneck,"Surprisingly good: incredibly gory, hilariously funny, tongue-in-cheek action.",8,16 March 2008,"My expectations were low when I went into this movie. In spite of her decent performance in David Gale, I had not filed Ms Mitra under ""competent actress"", but rather under ""hot babe"". I had not been very convinced by her performance in Shooter, but as it turns out, she managed to carry Doomsday rather nicely. Granted, it was not a great dramatic role, but it was also not a simple emotionless-heroine-with-snappy-one-liner bit, either. She does get some pretty cool one-liners, though, and delivers them nicely. But she also gets to do some nice comedy, and a little bit of drama.Which gets us to the main thing about this movie---the unique combination of action/gore and comedy. The movie does not take itself too seriously, and occasionally even seems to be its own parody. While it takes the action itself seriously in the technical sense, and executes it very competently, at times spectacularly so, it is also seasoned with often hilarious references, reflective jokes, and even plain-ole slapstick. The plot itself may not sound terribly novel---think Escape from New York (but with a beautiful woman instead of Kurt Russel!), 28 Days Later, Mad Max, Omega Man etc. What is unique about this flick is the melange of utter gore and hilarious comedy. Imagine the bad guys re-enacting a Blues Brothers concert (including dancing to a signature song; on stage!), while roasting a good guy alive. That sort of thing. It may sound crazy, or disgusting, or just incongruous, but it is effectively combined with interesting, and unique, effect.The supporting cast delivers great performances all around. Lester's talents remain a little underused---hope to see him again soon in Hustle, although this seems unlikely. Conway is simply in his own league at being over-the-top crazy, Liebenberg creates a very memorable mixture of beauty and evil, McDowell naturally focuses more on the evil bits but does a darn fine job on those, as well. O'Hara performance also stays with you, although his character being more of the quiet-sinister type, it can hardly stand out in a movie like this. Similar comments apply to the fine but less remarkable deliveries of Hoskins and Siddig.The visuals in this movie are varied and stunning. Beautiful countryside, destitute post-apocalyptic inner city, gory action, Mad Max-like road fights (but in Scotland, so the road actually has bends and stuff), battlefields, dungeons, medieval castles, etc. Designing and shooting this movie must have been a blast, and so is watching it. In addition to filming a wide variety of interesting settings, the director has the good sense of training the camera frequently on Mitra, who ranks high among the many great visuals in this film.Entertaining action flick with a good sense of humor. Worth watching if not taken too seriously.",Doomsday

The whole film is deliberately corny and a big step back from the absolute brilliance and promise of the director's previous films.Very watchable as a silly tribute and comedy. The trailer makes it look much better than it is...like a 28 Days Later..rather than a very dated and cheap fantasy film.I assume the director wanted to have cheap fun with the Mad Max genre but his previous films have been exceptionally brilliant and nothing like this kind of silly film.,Doomsday

I think the major problem with the film, is that the action sequences had way too many cuts, and way too many close up cuts and they were way too short. The special effects and gore were great, but I was expecting this generations Road Warrior, or the Warriors or Escape from NY.

The basic structure for the film is evident from its title; yes it's post-apocalyptic, dystopian and concerns mankind. Predominantly set in the near future the film depicts the aftermath of a deadly virus that took its root in Scotland. This virus leads to Scotland being quarantined and cordoned off via a huge wall and sea defences. After which the rest of the UK carries on functioning for several decades until the discovery of the virus in London. It then emerges that survivors have been spotted (from the air) on the streets of Glasgow. It is presumed that if there are survivors there must be a cure and an elite group, led by Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra), are sent into Glasgow to locate and retrieve the cure. Once there they encounter hundreds of savages that litter the streets and buildings.In his own words Neil Marshall stated that Doomsday is homage to the post-apocalyptic films of the past, and the film is definitely a hybrid of many, if not all, of those post-apocalyptic films. There's a belief with some film-makers that the word ""homage"" should be replaced with the word ""plagiarism"" and with Doomsday, they would probably have a case. The film isn't a parody, or a pastiche and nor does it have the grace of any of the previous offerings in this genre. It is, to put it bluntly, a rip-off.Neil Marshall heavily references John Carpenters Escape from New York (1981), some of Sinclair's dispositions and idiosyncrasies are lifted straight from the legendary Snake Pliskin including her often pining for a cigarette, the fact she has one eye and her blatant disregard for authority. The difference here is that this lead has a vagina. Doomsday also heavily draws on Mad Max (1979), Mad Max: The Road Warrior (1981) and Mad Max Beyond the Thunderdrome (1985). This is perhaps most evident from Sinclair as she is a Police officer with a dark history. Doomsday also employs a road chase that may have been an outtake from Beyond The Thunderdrome, additionally the manner in which the gangs behave and operate is lifted direct from those films. Annoyingly the film makes no attempt to cover up it's ""inspired"" premise i.e. an elite unit embarking on such a mission shouts of films like Aliens (1986), Predator (1987), Screamers (1995) and Marshall's own Dog Soldiers (2002).In sticking with its plagiaristic tones a train scene echoes a scene found in Walter Hill's The Warriors (1979), the similarities to that film doesn't stop there either as both employ gritty street scenes and centre on a small group that is both segregated and hunted down. An all-time cult classic in the post-apocalyptic genre is The Omega Man (1971) and Neil Marshall doesn't leave this film untouched either with its vacated city streets, gangs' night time mentality combined with the fact that each of the films explores the notion of mankind's survival in the aftermath of a deadly virus. A more recent ""deadly virus"" film that's referenced is Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later (2002) and another recent dystopian film that strikes of similarities is Children of Men (2006). Doomsday also takes a medieval twist in the way of Excalibur (1981), and seeks to have the protagonist fight her way out of capture like Russell Crowe in Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000). The manner in which the gangs scavenge for survival harks to Waterworld (1995) and their cannibalistic tendencies reminded me of Land of the Dead (2005) and The Time Machine (1960).Ultimately I felt the film lacked any originality, but those that have not seen all of the above mentioned films might take some enjoyment in Doomsday. For me the film is far too formulaic, the characters clichéd and the script poor, Bob Hoskins as the cockney Captain Nelson is cringe worthy and the acting in general is all a little too tongue-in-cheek. Ironically a similar description would perhaps accompany all of the films mentioned, but with a cult film you do need a sense of the new and something that is both original and interesting. The only interesting point of Doomsday is trying to spot how many films have been copied.Finally, it is safe to say that Neil Marshall cannot do cult and this is evident from the fact he has ripped-off so many other films. He is no John Carpenter, but interestingly there lies a sense of irony in the fact that when Marshall is awarded a larger budget he fails to deliver.",Doomsday
158,Unicorn-9,Better then Uwe Boll,3,24 December 2008,"I tried for quite a while to come up with something good to say about this movie, and the best I could manage was that whereas a Uwe Boll movie might make me want to rip out my own eyes to avoid having to watch any more, this one is just boring. Shortly after King Arthur appeared my girlfriend decided to call her mother on the phone for an hour, and then I cleaned the hamster's cage before we moved on to the insanely predictable 'Gladiator' scene (will she win? well, duh, what do you think?); that's how enthralling and exciting 'Dumbsday' is.Derivative, predictable, nonsensical, lacking a single original thought, full of stupid characters eager to get themselves killed at a moment's notice, barely able to go ten frames without making a cut in the mistaken belief that confusion is a good substitute for writing, pacing and suspense; now, I expected that from the trailer, and waited until I could watch it for free on DVD, but it would have been nice to be surprised.I honestly can't understand why so many people think so highly of this movie; 6/10 is far too high a rating, unless you haven't seen all the movies he's ripping off and imagine that this is somehow something new.",Doomsday
159,mattbaxter72,Stupid. Stupid. And even more stupid than that,1,22 January 2010,"I just love the end of the world. Whether it's Day Of The Triffids, War Of The Worlds, The Stand, 28 Days Later or any number of other books or movies, there's some vicious little child in me that takes great joy in seeing the whole of civilization smashed into little bitty pieces. So when I heard that Neil Marshall, the director of the great Dog Soldiers, was making an end-of-the-world movie, my sadistic little heart leapt for joy. This was going to be good. This was going to be one of the movies of the year.And I gave it the benefit of the doubt, at least at first. The clunky voice-over I could live with, the excessive gore wasn't a problem (exploding bunny, yay!), and... OK, why are those soldiers standing in the middle of a horde of rabid, disease-carrying Scottish people? Especially when there's a big, safe wall not a hundred feet away? And how did they build that wall so quickly, and how did they prevent anyone from getting out of Scotland, especially before anyone knew how serious the virus was? All right, asking too many questions. There's bound to be one or two plot holes, you just have to look the other way and pretend they aren't there. There's a good action sequence, and then - who's this stumbling old man? He clearly can't act for toffee, but he looks strangely familiar... Bob Hoskins? When did he become such a lousy actor? OK, we can ignore that - my God, the guy playing Canaris is even worse. And how come, with Britain's economy in the dumper, the population of London has doubled thirty years into the future? Wouldn't people be, you know, leaving, rather than moving INTO horrible slums in a dying city? Where did the infected people in that London basement come from? Did they drop from the sky? How come they got there without infecting half the country on their way? And if the evil mastermind is going to wipe out London anyway, why did he bother sending a team up to find a cure for the virus? What was the point of that? And how did those tanks run into the middle of a vast herd of cows without noticing? One cow you might miss, but there are about a thousand of the buggers milling around, and despite the tank's big glass windows, they don't see any cows until someone steps out of the vehicle. I've heard of selective vision, but that's just dribbling madness.And oh yeah, you didn't think tanks generally had large, plate glass windows, did you? And if they did, they'd be made of some amazingly tough material, right? Nope. The windows of this tank can be busted by THROWING A ROCK AT THEM - making the invincible machine vulnerable to anyone with a throwing arm and a pebble.OK, that's enough. 24 minutes into the movie and I just can't write any more. The dialogue is clichéd, the acting is abominable, the plot doesn't make the slightest bit of sense, everything about this film is poorly done trash that seems to have been knocked off in a couple of days by a bunch of witless clowns with less talent than a dung beetle. And yeah, I have seen the rest of the movie - I could be here all day talking about the bits that make no sense, but I'll spare you.All right. Getting worked up now. I'll just take my medication and go off to bed. And when I wake the next morning, maybe I'll have forgotten this wretched, pathetic, miserable dog's dinner of a film.",Doomsday

The director obviously enjoyed making this movie and it shows. To say it takes inspiration from John Carpenter and George Miller's films are an understatement. It never comes close to eclipsing either of them, but it doesn't really try to. It gracefully walks the line between an homage and a straight rip-off. The issues this movie has are pretty obvious. Every character is one dimensional except for the scientist doctor guy ( who really cares what he is) who has all of 5 minutes of screen time. This movie has some god awful CGI, including a bloody eye at the beginning of the movie that looks like a video game wound. Most of the time though, this movie goes for practical effects. It uses real fire. real car crashes. Real squibs when getting shot (for the most part). The villains are in one of two camps. They're either just crazy for the sake of being crazy, or the evil leader type for the sake of being an evil leader. But then again it's pretty obvious this movie was going for a fun film rather than one with any depth whatsoever, and it mainly succeeds. overall, this is probably the only 6.5 film I can recommend to anyone.

Amazing soundtrack, fast moving with great cinematography for a perfect mix of ear, brain and eye candy! As an added bonus there are all those sexy Scottish accents lol! The film I saw was subtitled which I found distracting and not necessary at all. The actors speak well and the accents are very understandable so I found it silly that someone would subtitle it.I've seen the film a few times since and haven't seen subtitles again which I was glad of. The low star rating really surprises me and I feel this film is a true gem not the kind of rubbish coming out of America at the moment. Ignore the low rating and go into watching this with an open mind and hopefully you will see the brilliance that I did. While it is no zombie movie it is about a virus that closes off Scotland from the rest of the world and truly does have the visual effects of a crazy Mad Max film complete with cool costumes, flesh eaters, lots of fast movements and rarely a dull moment.

Sadly, none of us was entertained. I mean, we watched a pretty stupid zombie movie before this one, and a pretty much mediocre horror thriller afterward, and both were better than this one.The movie wants to tell us that it takes roughly 30 years to devolve from rather ""civilized"" guys in suits to either post-apocalyptic punks or knights. Why not go a bit further in the future and make the setting at least half-way believable, even if it's stupid either way? Even with this completely retarded premise, the movie takes itself far too seriously. It would have been fun if it didn't, perhaps, but it does. As it is, it's, simply put, a completely messed up mixture of Mad Max and some medieval / fantasy thing with a nearly audible clunk between the two. I like bad movies. The problem with this one is: Technically it isn't badly done. The effects are pretty decent, the acting is as good as the script allowed. The rest of the movie, though, is just bad. Not the funny kind of bad, just bad. Oh, and the chase near the end of the movie had me cringe quite a few times at the stupidity of our ""heroes"".To sum it up: I can't join in all these high scoring reviews for this one.

171,atliel,What do you get as a result when Neal Marshall makes a film with a big budget?,3,16 August 2008,"Another example of style over substance. I guess I had high hopes, considering that The Descent was so good, I may have over-hyped the film for myself. As violent or gruesome as The Descent was none of it was gratuitous simply because those scenes pushed the narrative forward. However, in Doomsday, the violence and the gore were there for their own sake. I actually thought about what the film would be like had those scenes been edited out and I realized it would have made no difference. I need to make something clear here, violence and gore don't bother me, I'm a big horror buff and ""Dead Alive"" is one of many films I recommend to watch. What bothers me are gimmicks, stylistic choices that provide nothing to the story. For example, multi-colored punks a-la ""Mad Max Beyond Thunder-Dome"", city landscapes not unlike ""Escape from New York"" and the wipe-out of a population by a virus in the vein of ""28 Days Later"" are strewn about in the script with no particular rhyme or reason. Sure all those films are great and I don't blame him for being influenced by them but what's the point? -The main character is neither worth hating or liking, she's simply a video game heroin who goes from point A to B and whose background is glossed over.-The villain is really Malcolm McDowell playing himself so that can't be it...Something tells me that there's a really good story hidden in all that but his ideas were just not fully realized. Which is too bad because the film could have been a cult B-film classic. As it stands it just comes off as a film that rips off of other cult classics and uses exaggerated violence as a crutch.

As my title suggests, I think Neil Marshall wrote the film by watching 4 TVs simultaneously playing Mad Max, The Warriors, 28 Days Later and Escape from New York. What I am saying sounds like a criticism but it really isn't. Doomsday is fun. It probably isn't the sum of the films that went into the blender to make it but somehow it manages to make you go with it. This is predictable rubbish of the worst kind and yet you'll find yourself enjoying it. *not really a spoiler*A terrifying plague has broken out in Glasgow and spread to the rest of Scotland. Despite England's avowed refusal to deep fry all food stuffs, the Scots are looking to escape. But no! Evil Scotland-hating England has rebuilt Hadrian's Wall out of cargo containers, and elected to let the Scots die alone rather than become infected themselves.30 years later a child survivor of the plague - Eden Sinclair (the British Milla Jovavitch  Rhona Mitra; stonkingly gorgeous but apparently incapable of acting her way out of a wet paper bag) is all growed up and now face-shoots people as Major in the police. After a suspected outbreak of the plague in London Prime Minister Gaius Baltar, and his gravel-voiced Alastair Campbell-alike  Canaris, tell Rhona to hop it over to bonny Scotland and find a cure for the virus.Much nuttery then ensues involving, but not limited to; exploding rabbits, tanks, squashed cows, synchronised arse-slapping, human-cooking, decapitation, cannibalism, decapitation, steam trains, medieval knights, King Lear, trial by combat, a Bentley GT, a gimp-o-cycle, more decapitation and a not-very-surprising double cross. *end spoiler*Doomsday may be completely derivative hokum but it has an élan, a joie de vivre that is lacking from so many other films (most with vastly bigger budgets). Inventiveness can be an overrated quality, after all a dried rat sandwich is pretty inventive but it doesn't necessarily make it good food. I started watching it thinking ""well, I've seen all this before"" and I had  but if you let your brain freewheel you'll enjoy it. It hasn't got a message and it doesn't want to make you think. If you watch it looking to nit-pick every small detail of the film so that you can legitimately hate it then, guess what, you wont enjoy it, and that would be a shame  this is a film that wants to be enjoyed.The special effects deserve a mention as it is nice to see big special effects that don't rely solely on CGI. There is some but mostly it's good old makeup, modeling and pyrotechnics. I'd like to see more movies using this approach since done well it is far more convincing.Doomsday isn't: Inventive, Original, Enormously coherent, Full of CGI, lacking a sense of humour.Doomsday is: Enjoyable, Gory, Good fun.Nowadays I only give two ratings on IMDb, 1 or 10 on the principle that I either enjoyed a film or I didn't and trying to rank stuff is impossibly subjective. Despite initial worries Doomsday thoroughly entertained me and earns a 10.

If they would have called her ""Snake"" I would have died.The plot was unrealistic and the bad guys had some sort of superpowers, that allowed them to locate military trained soldiers in the middle of a city littered with debris and hundreds of square miles of hiding places, and to virtually sneak up on them with ""motorcycles"", ""cars"", ""buses"", etc.The movie was watchable if you like to watch ""mindless"" action movies like I do on occasion. This movie really seemed to be an attempt to cross an action movie with a horror movie, but, it failed to be ""scary"", only perverse and twisted in some parts due the nature of the violence. I WOULD NOT let a kid watch this movie.My main beef with this movie was the fact that they used a castle in the movie in the most idiotic circumstances. The whole premise of the castle could have been very entertaining if there would have been a little bit of a mix of modern and medieval at least, but, instead they chose to make the inhabitants throwbacks to medieval times that had tossed away all ""modern"" methods, this didn't seem to make any sense to me and kind of took away from the movie. I mean there where crates of guns in a bomb shelter and the medieval inhabitants chose to use swords in battles against firearms. (Scratching my head)Another beef is the fact that the world outside the clean zone is supposed to be survival minded and yet there are hundreds of ""unopened"" boxes of supplies in the ""mountain path"" bomb shelter they all pass through.

Where do I start? The film never really gets going, Rhona Mitra is very pouty but she has hardly any lines so instead of being a lead she sort of fades into the background. Bob Hoskins is about the only actor here who leaves any kind of impression and he's only in about 5% of the film. Sean Pertwee is also thoroughly wasted in a tiny role here. The story and plot is just so.... blah. By the end of the film you don't care about the outcome, or any of the characters for that matter either. Bad direction, plot-holes everywhere and, one of my most hated things in a film, a blaring noisy soundtrack that nearly drowns out the dialogue at certain points.

The action in Doomsday is non-stop and the humor was great. Even though the film has several elements from other movies, I thought it was really good how the director put everything together. Doomsday is surely entertaining and is one hell of a ride. The film has great gore and some creepy and disgusting scenes. If you are a gory action fan, Doomsday is the movie for you.",Doomsday

182,paul-2686,the bunny splattering: my favourite bad thing in this movie full of badness,1,14 August 2009,"Unlike most poor sods who sat through this dreck, I got to enjoy its badness with a posse of SF fans. Doomsday is overflowing with rip-offs. We had a pretty good time yelling out the cinematic ""influences"" on each scene. It was pretty incredible how many moments were bad imitations of other films!There's so much wrong with this movie that it's not really possible to report on all of it and still have a life. So I'm just going to tell you about my ""favourite"" bad thing: the moment when we all knew that we would be heckling for the rest of the night.It was the splodin' bunny rabbit that tipped us off.The wall defenses are being demonstrated. ""There's nothing alive within 500 metres of the wall."" Obligatory shot of automated guns. Cut to a pile of rocks. A cute widdle bunny sticks his head out. Uh oh! Cut back to machine guns, swivelling on servos. Cut back to bunny, and ... bunny kablooies in a hail of high-calibre bullets. Splat!Lots of violence is one thing. But this movie had a lot of silly violence. Violence that made me scratch my head. Violence that made my laugh at the violence, instead of with it. Mix that up with a whole lot of really dorky dialogue, thin characters, and internal logic problems you could drive a truck through, and this is just the worst popular movie of the year, period.",Doomsday
183,keithsealy,"Showed such promise, and then falls flat",3,19 January 2009,"For the first half of this movie was really enjoying it. I was into the whole premise. I liked the main character and her back story. I liked the political interplay. I was really into this movie for the first 30 minutes. Then... it degraded in the b-movie action flick with bad writing and action scenes so bad I fast forwarded through most of them.Some specific examples...I am sorry, but a mob of people using rocks, clubs, and arrows cannot take down a armored personnel carrier. Earlier in the movie, they made a point of telling us how tough the carriers were, but they obviously didn't consider plate glass on the window a problem???? Argh! - Why resort to the 'Road Warrior' style of characters and costumes? It looked stupid and made what had been a serious movie just silly. When I saw the first could of bad guys dressed in mohawks, Nazi helmets, and neon I knew the movie had taken a turn for the worst. Argh! (Not to mention that people who had the skills to survive in a post apocalyptic world would not be so dumb as to charge into automatic gun fire.) - They take a shortcut through a bunker loaded with equipment and supplies. No one, in a world where resources were few, thought to ransack this bunker? Argh! I could go on... but you get the point. It went from a movie with lots of promise to something truly dumb. It is like the professional director and writers quit half way through, and it was finished by sci-fi and ren-fare fanboys.",Doomsday
184,NotTheOne000,Less than the sum of its parts,6,26 October 2008,"As a big fan of the genres this film is rooted in, and as a big fan of Descent and Dog Soldiers, I was thoroughly looking forward to this film. I was disappointed.Too often I felt I was watching a montage of other films (Escape from New York, Aliens, Resident Evil, Mad Max 2 & 3 etc) rather than a movie that was informed by the past, but still a vision in its own right. Then there were the plot holes and the things that didn't make sense, and the rather anti-climactic and totally predictable ending. And the cinematography prevented any real sense of connection between the viewer and the characters.Some directors do their best work when their budget is limited and they work within a genre they are best suited for. Marshall overproduced Doomsday and, perhaps, stepped outside the type of film his style works so well for. Yes, there are good action sequences and some of the scenes succeed - but overall, the film just doesn't quite work.",Doomsday
185,jhobdell,Off-beat but right on the money,8,16 May 2008,"It's been a long time since I saw a film like this: I thought films with this much gory, action-packed violence had been consigned to the ""do not open"" category of the 1980s film era (mostly containing contrived efforts starring Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Van Damme).Don't let me put you off though, there is plenty to recommend the film, even if the gore isn't always necessary/believable. The special effects are mostly limited to the make-up of the virus victims and they're a perfect blend of shock and terror. Much of the other effects have a refreshingly home-made look (I'm a huge fan rather than all this CGI rubbish).Rhona Mitra is really sexy as well as gutsy, plus her slightly masculine stance and swagger are far more believable than Angelina Jolie's in the Lara Croft films. Craig Conway is blisteringly psychotic as Sol. David O'Hara is brilliantly odious in his self-possessing role as Canaris, and Bob Hoskins adds an air of realism and class that the film definitely needs.One of the most interesting points is the juxtaposition of three different eras of British history: the 'now' of London in 2035, the futuristic anarchy of Glasgow, and the mediaeval society of rural Scotland where Kane resides.Finally, despite the backing of Universal Pictures, this film has a fresh, off-beat feel that is free of any of Hollywood's commercialism, and the American-actor-free diet of the cast is a huge relief! All in all I think the film comes across like a more convincing version of the early shoot-em-up computer games like Doom, but the underlying personal stories give it a touch of soul that makes it hugely entertaining and I for one will be looking out for it on DVD.",Doomsday
186,tonopah6,Chickie-Wickie-Flickie,5,28 September 2008,"I've liked Rhona Mitra since I first saw her in Get Carter; and I liked seeing her in this movie, even though she was not right for the part. Like all too often, producers and directors miscast the films they make: in this one they should have chosen a bigger woman than Rhona. She did look like she had been pumping some iron, though, which was good to see: the arms and shoulders looked good; but in no way could a woman like her be able to kill the people she killed. (Where are today's Brigitte Nielsen and Cory Everson?). Kurt Russell got away with winning against bigger opponents in Escape from New York; but little Rhona is just 5 foot 4, and beating the guts out of 6 foot 8 inch barbarians. Then we have a girl who had never seen a car before, and low and behold: she and some other dude end up being the quickest pit crew in the history of gassing a vehicle (in order to get away from her daddies barbaric henchmen). Although, in summing it up, I'd have to say: Nevertheless, despite all, this was somewhat entertaining.",Doomsday
187,TheDoomSong,Terrific Trash Flick,6,9 July 2010,"With Doomsday, Neil Marshall pays a grand homage to a multitude of apocalyptic sci-fi and action movies of the 80s and 90s. The movie, although sporting a run-of-the-mill script, almost works as a clip-show or best-of reel of movies like ""Escape from New York"", ""Mad Max - The Road Warrior"", ""Aliens"", ""Resident Evil"", ""Army of Darkness"", and even ""28 Days Later"". Amazingly, Marshall manages to tie all this up into an explosive and fast paced action- shocker that actually works quite well. The storyline is pretty much a combination of John Carpenter's ""Escape"" and whatever zombie-quarantine movie you favor: a horrible flesh-eating virus breaks out in Scotland. Nobody knows a cure for it, so they simply pull up a wall, shutting off Scotland from the rest of the world. A young mother is not allowed on the last helicopter out but manages to get her little daughter on the chopper after the kid has had its eye shot out. Some years later, that kid is now a smoking hot woman named Eden Sinclair (Mitra) with a bionic eye, keeping the streets of London clean from the future scum. When the virus flares up again, she is sent back into the quarantine zone, formerly known as Scotland. It turns out that the government has kept it secret, that there are traces of survivors in the fenced-in territorial. Now they assume, that on the inside, a scientist named Dr. Kane has found a cure for the virus. Sinclair gets 46 hours to retrieve the vaccine. What awaits her inside is a tour-de-force trip through almost every decade there has ever been an action movie set in. We get armored knights in arena fights, spiky haired punks with chainsaws and clubs, futuristic guns and combat suits, and one of the most amazing car chases involving a Bentley ever made. Despite all the gore and violence, the movie does not take itself too serious and allows the viewer to play ""name the source-movie"" almost through the entire flick. Stylistically, Marshall borrows mostly from Carpenter and Miller (he even names two soldiers after them) but almost always manages to pull it off in good taste. For example: the score resembles Carpenter's monotonous compositions so perfectly, that it feels like it's been taken directly out of one of his movies. Whenever the viewer has gotten used to a certain vibe, Marshall throws in something outrageous, like an 80s music dance choreography, which in return completely trips up the audience.Having said all that, ""Doomsday"" is certainly not for everybody. It's loud and it's stupid. People who do not appreciate the iconic genre-movies Marshall idolizes and used as (obvious) inspiration, will most likely not appreciate this one either, and even if they do, they might find the way Marshall spliced the aspects together slanderous and clumsy. Everybody else will probably have a fun ride if they are not too squeamish and don't mind to watch a cute little bunny being pulverized by an automatic machine gun. ""Doomsday"" has what it takes to become a cult classic.",Doomsday
188,ftyl,Nostalgia ain't what it used to be...,7,8 June 2008,"After Dog Soldiers (2002) and The Descent (2005), Neil Marshall seemed like the new wunderkind of British horror cinema. His latest, Doomsday, is a markedly different film from his earlier work  most clearly in it's inability to choose which genre it belongs to. Dog Soldiers clearly leaned in the direction of comedy while The Descent was a masterful lesson in claustrophobic horror, marred only slightly by a number of over the top action scenes in its final act. Doomsday has funny moments, horrible moments, thrilling moments and, more often, moments filled with levels of absurdity which would not feel out of place in a full-blown spoof.The year is 2033. A quarter of a century has passed since the outbreak of a fatal disease in northern Britain. Scotland has been cut off - segregated behind a barrier closely following the lines of Hadrian's wall. But the disease has returned, the south is threatened and a crack military team (led by Rhona Mitra) is sent into the contaminated zone to find survivors, and a cure. Throw in Marshall's proved abilities to create tension and a little offbeat humour and it sounds like the making of a minor classic, right? Well yes and no. The films' greatest strength is also its biggest liability  namely nostalgia.Some films use nostalgia extremely well. A recent example would be Superman Returns. The slow, majestic sweep of the title sequence served to reintroduce us the universe of Superman (literally and figuratively). John Ottman's marginal reworking of John William's superb score was so evocative that it, in conjunction with the familiar (though now CG enhanced) starscapes created a near instant sense of comfort. Superman Returns is homage, Doomsday is convoluted pastiche.The film is a literal expression of what happens when you give a director too much freedom. After only 2 features, Neil Marshall's track record was simply not strong enough to be allowed this kind of free reign. The result is a mess; the bastard child of a dozen or so 70's and 80's films  from the Warriors to Mad Max via Escape from New York. It also moves schizophrenically from one genre to the next: near future vistas give way to post-apocalyptic deserted cities (a la 28 Days Later) before moving on to psychedelic dancing cannibals, mobs of bikers and an extended, somewhat unnecessary, car chase. Did I mention there's a medieval section as well that comes off as a nicely shot mash-up of Robin Hood and Gladiator? As a knowing and self-referential piece of cinematic shlock this would be perfectly enjoyable but the fact is that Doomsday takes itself far too seriously. What humour exists is often as blatant as assuming that a stunning woman like Mitra aping almost Snake Plissken worthy dialogue is entertaining. This works, to a point, but it is missing that vital cue for the audience; how are we supposed to take this? In Dog Soldiers there was a healthy sense of the ridiculous, both on the part of the characters and the audience. Likewise in The Descent, we know from the outset that the film will not be lighthearted. Doomsday refuses to make that choice, veering from an overlong dance sequence which looks like the gag reel from a Prodigy music video to the genuinely shocking roasting of a live human being. The contrast of different styles can work within the structure of a film to make the relief of the comedy or the shock of the horror more powerful but when it vacillates this often and this wildly any such affect is lost.One major point to remember is that the movies which Doomsday references are themselves a mixed bag. That's the thing with nostalgia, its better felt than examined. The original Superman comes across, to me, as strangely elitist these days and Escape from New York is an extremely uneven film. So, in trying to bring these kinds of films together, Marshall has doubly handicapped himself: Firstly, by being limited to sources of varying quality. Secondly, by trying to reference so many other films, the coherence of Doomsday suffers. So much so that each scene begins to resemble a discrete entity, rather than a part of the whole.Doomsday is, however, a difficult film to truly dislike. There is a kind of manic energy to it, an undercurrent of gleeful nastiness that allows it to bulldoze through the clichés, plot holes and bloated editing. The action is generally well shot and presented and the whole film has a technical polish which we are not used to seeing in British cinema. The acting is generally good and Mitra makes an impressive leading lady, hopefully this will be a breakthrough role for her. As for Neil Marshall, this is without a doubt his weakest film to date and makes one wonder whether he's ready to make the move to big budget film-making (there are rumours he is about to be subsumed into the Hollywood machine). We can only hope he works from a better script with more supervision in the future.I find it hard to imagine that we will still be talking about Doomsday in twenty years but for all its' faults there is some entertainment to be had. With the right attitude, a DVD turned up loud and a few drinks it might manage to become a minor cult favourite in the future. And, through the quality obscuring mists of nostalgia, maybe that is how a classic is born...",Doomsday

190,beerwine900,"Fun, but has been done.",6,21 May 2008,"Now i'm just gonna say that i think virus movies should stop for a few years, there's been to many recently and their a bit worn out, with 28 days/weeks later, Res Evil and I am legend. it's all got to go in another direction rather than copying or remaking classics.April 2008, a natural born virus (Reaper virus) spreads through Glasgow, the army want to evacuate but the risk of passing infection is to great, martial law is ordered and all roads and exits from Scotland are road blocked by soldiers, gradually as food and resources in Scotland runs out, people turn to chaos, a 30ft steel wall is placed isolating Scotland from the rest of the world containing the infection. 2030ish and the virus breaks out again, the government learn of people living in Glasgow so there must be a cure, a small army unit is dispatched into Scotland to find the cure and return within 48 hours.I'll admit i wasn't expecting anything special, and it was nothing that was classed as brilliant or intelligent but you don't go to see a action/horror for the complicated plot. However even with it's con's it is still worth a watch.Con's and general stupid bits: 1)The soldiers in the beginning of the movie we're idiots and made out to be poorly trained and undisciplined. (I hate movies which make you think ""why didn't they do that"").2)The armoured vehicles they drove into the restricted zone were 30mm bullet proof but an axe broke the glass (bullet proof tank should have bullet proof glass, durr!).3)Major Sinclair (Mitra looked great) used her mechanical eye to look round corners while in CQB so she wore an eye patch over her missing right eye but she was right handed so how did she aim her gun.4)When they entered Scotland they wanted stealth, so for some daft reason they drove tanks with double V12 engines which obviously make a lot of noise.5)Kanes castle was so medieval it was unrealistic, and his people were crap fighters, surely a martial artist or ex soldier would have been left behind and survived then trained Kanes soldiers for combat, it would have been easier to move forward learning new things rather than old things like sword fighting.6)It took far to much from other movies hence this should be the last virus movie for a long time.7)The intro on the stage with Soul was to long and should have been 8-9 seconds no more than that.8)The music was wrong throughout the majority of the movie and didn't suit it.There are more con's but i can't remember them.Pro's: 1)It was entertaining and i will watch it again (worth bargain day £4.10p).2) Rhoda Mitra performed well in acting and action (she was definitely in the gym and it showed),I was actually a little impressed with Adrian Lester who i usually find annoying, Bob Hoskins was himself nothing more or less or different.3)Rifle design and costume design was very good, only beaten by Lord of the Rings trilogy and Marvel design of Ironman (that was cool).There are more pro's but i can't think of them and i know i've slagged it off but i still liked it.8 out of 10 for entertainment.2 out of 10 for intelligence and originality.6 out of 10 overall",Doomsday
191,jayce2279,Rhona Plissken beyond Thunderdome,8,21 May 2008,"Being a child of the 80s, I grew up watching the ""Mad Max"" trilogy, ""Escape From New York"", ""Cyborg"" and ""the Salute of the Jugger (the Blood of Heroes)"". During the 90s I searched video stores for other genre films like ""Escape from Absolom (No Escape)"", ""Freejack"", ""Fortress"" and ""Split Second"". It was during this time the underrated sci-fi/ fantasy low budget movie ""Beowulf"" first introduced me to the lovely Rhona Mitra who was to starr in ""Doomsday"" 9 years later. But in 1999 ""the Matrix"" single-handedly ended the reign of the post-apocalyptic B movie. It was then replaced by CGI filled monstrosities like ""Aeon Flux"" or ""Ultraviolet"", that gave you the impression you were watching a video game, rather than an actual film. Thank god for Quentin Tarrantino, Robert Rodriguez, Rob Zombie and the great George A. Romero, though, who had the notoriety, balls, modest financial means, and love for genre films to revive the low budget horror genre and pave the way for the Brits to create the post-apocalyptic beauty that is ""Doomsday"". The film is obviously a ""love letter"" to ""Mad Max"" and ""Escape from New York"" with some ""Fortress"" and ""Escape from Absolom/ No Escape"" thrown in there, but it is also reminiscent of ""2019: After the Fall of New York"", ""Warrior of the Lost World"", ""the Bronx Warriors"" and ""2020 Texas Gladiators"". Although ""Doomsday"" obviously has much nicer sets and better costumes than these Italian rip offs.In 2008, a killer virus has infected most of the Scottish population and the U.K. government has decided to quarantine the area by building a wall around Scotland, thus wiping out the entire population and killing the virus. However, a couple of decades later, the virus re-emerges in London. The totalitarian British regime has learned of survivors on the other side of the fence and sends in a military team with Aliens-style armor and a couple of scientists to locate the survivors and find out why the virus hasn't killed them. The mission is led by Rhona Mitra, a slightly better looking version of Snake Plissken, complete with missing eye. However, the group is soon taken prisoner, tortured and eaten by a gang of punkers and girls in SM outfits, led by Sol, the Lord Humungus of Glasgow. The rest of the movie takes us on a quest of survival through the ruins of Scotland, accompanied by a synthesizer soundtrack that could have been recorded in 1981 and ends with a slightly humorous Mad Max-style car chase. Even though this may tone down the brutal feel of the first three quarters of the film, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" was not without its funny moments, either.If you liked ""the Matrix"", ""I, Robot"" or ""Star Wars: Episodes I, II and III"", please do not watch this film. However, if you are a lover of 80s and early 90s post-apocalyptic low budget movies, you will not be disappointed.",Doomsday

The basic premise is that an incurable plague decimates Scotland and a giant wall is erected to contain the victims in and leave them to die. Years later the plague appears beyond the wall and there still isn't a cure. The authorities have suppressed evidence of survivors in the ""hot zone"" and dispatch a special forces team led by Rhona Mitra to find out how the survivors haven't perished. What follows is a roller-coaster of action and adventure as the intrepid team look for a cure and make their way through the wasted cities encountering flesh eating tribes and medieval warlords. This movie is what happens when Escape from New York and 28 days later have a party with King Arthur and Mad Max; almost the perfect movie.",Doomsday
195,svetlastoyanova,Better than I expected,6,26 May 2008,"Doomsday is surprisingly good film. I was left with the impression it never stops, there isn't a minute boredom or static moment in it. If you thought the genre of post-apocalyptic, virus-struck societies fighting for survival in the ruins of abandoned cities has nothing else to offer, well you are in for a surprise.Well..., there is virus infection by the book, contaminating the infected areas, leaving a lot of people to die in order to save a hell lot more and 25 years later we are back where we started. Thank God this time around there are no mindless zombies trying to eat everything that moves, it is worse, there are survivors. And they are not friendly.This film appeal is in it's dynamic, you don't really have time to think whether you have seen that in a different movie or not. There are people dying from the get going, and it just doesn't stop till the last credits. You would have never thought you will see a Bentley and a knight in the same movie; this is all I am going to say. Hats off to the director Neil Marshal for the great special effects and all the gory details, I don't remember seeing a single CGI in the whole movie, though I could be wrong. The dialogue is tight and scarce, nothing fancy, just straight to the point talk, yet it gives you enough to figure out what is going on.There is Rhona Mitra as a dangerous government mercenary, killing her way through the movie. Sexy, lethal and morally challenged with her mother's faith. We see Bob Hoskins as her captain/friend Nelson and a quality appearance by Malcolm McDowell as Kane.This is an action packed fighting sequences with attractive kicking-ass female, high-speed car chases of two decades, and I-am-a- virus-survivor excuse for bad clothing, all that covered up with few decent buckets of blood. What else you need from a movie!?",Doomsday
196,shatteredrifle,Doomsday Hits The Target,8,9 January 2011,"""Have a piece of your friend."" Basically, the Reaper virus spreads throughout a city in England, and the government quarantine the area, trapping all the residents, infected and non-infected alike. Decades after, the virus appears elsewhere, and they are forced to send back a team to find a cure, if there is indeed one. So here we are again at a post-apocalyptic scenario full of blood, infection, cannibalism, and of course, politics. Fortunately, Doomsday does not disappoint in fusing them together, making the film quite entertaining to watch. Like Dawn of the Dead, it does not show how the virus started, but focuses on the aftermath; how everyone coped with the situation in order to survive.Rhona Mitra is Major Eden Sinclair, the mission leader with nothing to lose. She displays yet again that she can do action, and more importantly, carry the flow of a film. It is always a delight to see her punish those who get in her way. Seeing her here has inspired me to look for her other works and material.One of the high points of this movie is how it manages to show the different types of things one looks for in an action movie and not feel awkward doing it. It features lots of gunfire, car chase scenes, medieval sword fights, massive pandemonium on the streets, you name it. By doing so, it is also able to veer away from being a generic gore fest, which seems to be pretty common nowadays. Having seen The Descent and Centurion (both under the direction of Neil Marshall), it seems that this director really likes his blood. True enough, Doomsday does not tone it down. Other viewers might think that this is an exaggeration, but I believe it is an integral part in showing how serious the events are, and in keeping you glued to your seats. Besides, the violence does not get to a ridiculous point like Machete's.On the surface, the film seems a bit shallow and might be mistaken for just an avenue for another man versus the infected type of thing. However, Doomsday makes us aware of something very important: If one day, the world does go to hell, we're sure of two things which are going to happen: chaos, and the emergence of new systems that take advantage of this chaos.Blood, infection, cannibalism and politics. What more do you want? Doomsday is your gateway to having a very entertaining and exhilarating 100-minute experience.",Doomsday

199,Condom-full-of-Hatred,Kinda fun but pointless,6,3 December 2010,"Neil Marshall had a tough act to follow after the laughs and gore of Dog Soldiers, and the balls out claustrophobic terror of The Descent. After two home runs like that, it wasn't going to be long before the money men came to Marshall's door and offered him carte blanche on making whatever the hell he wanted. So Marshall decides to direct a script he wrote years ago that was an homage to his favorite 80's action and sci-fi films, and relished in the budget he has been given.Some time in the near future a nasty virus spreads throughout Britain, melting and killing all who come into contact with it. The authorities decide to seal off the most infected part of the country (the poor old Highlands) and build a wall around it, sealing in the poor diseased souls! Cut to 30 years later and the whole mess has nearly been forgotten about.That is, until the virus shows up again in the slums of London. The government are left with only one choice. Send a crack squad of operatives back into the sealed off Glasgow, to try and track down the mad scientist who locked himself into this dark world 30 years ago. Lead by the mysterious and sexy one eyed Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra), they soon discover that there are many survivors beyond the wall, and are roaming the streets in violent gangs. Can they locate the cure in 24 hours and get out with their asses intact? You won't know unless you watch it, fool! Once inside it doesn't take long for the sh!te to hit the fan. Crazy punk warriors soon grab em, burn one of em alive, kill a load more, leaving our fiesty heroine to try and figure it all out. As I already mentioned, the film was conceived as an 'hommage' to old school action flicks, but as it turns out, Neil marshall has basically turfed about 15 films into a blender and set that felcher on high power. It's basically Escape From New York -meets- Mad Max -meets- Mad Max Beyond ThunderDrome -meets- The Warriors -meets- 28 Days Later -meets- Underworld -meets- Aliens -meets- Resident Evil -meets-, blah, you get the picture! I don't think there was one single original idea knocking around in here, even the final 'twist' is straight out of Snake Pliskins playbook! She even only has one eye! It may be one sexy eye, but that's not the point! Now don't get me wrong, just because on paper it sounds like a load of thieving gee scum, that doesn't mean it ain't a fun load of thieving gee scum. The film rips along at a breakneck pace, with non stop action and exploding heads. Yup, this one get's pretty messy in the gore department, which is always welcome in my brown stained book. We also get served a decent enough cast to keep us watching the nonsense unfold. Mitra in the lead is certainly a tasty piece of work, and Bob Hoskins as her boss is always watchable. As is everyone's favorite ham king, Malcolm McDowell as the mad scientist, of course.I can see that the majority of the audience are either going to decide that it's a bunch of artless bollox that has already been done in the 80's, or won't have a felching clue who someone like John Carpenter even is and just lap up the gore and car stunts. Either way, neither group is wrong really. It's a film as artless as any of the Resident Evil series, but has enough gore and action to stop you from wanting to turn it off. Marshall has gone as far into 'hommage' as is humanly possible, but where does he go from here? I'm hoping he goes back to basics on the next one, and realises he doesn't need a massive budget and thievery to entertain his hardcore audience",Doomsday
200,strausbaugh,Brutally Stupid,1,10 September 2008,"John Carpenter, George Miller, George Romero, and the whoevers responsible for the Resident Evil franchise should file a class action suit. Never has a movie ripped off so many other movies so blatantly and so poorly. The writing is retarded, the acting is sub-Arnold, the camera-work ugly, the editing chaotic, the gore pointless and superfluous. Clearly this was intentional. No movie could be this insultingly imbecilic by accident. The laws of chance dictate that something would go right somewhere along the line. But nothing does. It just keeps getting stupider and uglier and more ridiculous scene by bloody, derivative scene. No, a film could only be this bad if everyone involved made a pact to create the very very worst Z-grade action-gore post- apocalyptic sci-fi movie ever made. They succeeded.

201,gvis,Post-apoc action horror that shouldn't be taken too serious.,7,14 May 2021,"This movie can best be described as Mad Max meets 28 days later meets Escape from NY. You know what to expect.In the future a virus kills off a lot of humans (surprise!!) and the border between England and Scotland is sealed off with a modernized version of Hadrian's wall. A doctor that still resides on the other side is rumored to have found a cure. A female bad-ass action hero is recruited to be the new Snake Plissken and find the doctor and his cure inside infected dystopia.The similarity with Escape from NY is pretty obvious by now, and when you see the movie you will see other influences as well (especially Mad Max, but I also noticed some Black Hawk Down in it too). All in all it's just a horror/action flick where you can switch off your brain and enjoy the action. Don't expect any Oscar material here though. I find the part at the end (where the main characters end in up in a sort of post-apocalyptic neo-medieval castle) to be a bit hard to take serious. Also the movie feels a bit too long for it's own good. Other than that, I enjoyed it. I actually liked it more than (the overrated) 28 days later.",Doomsday

Some of the dialog is hard to understand because of the British accents, but I had a good time and I wasn't really concerned with figuring out some complicated plot. The effects are well done and plentiful. I know it sounds like a combination of Mad Max, Escape From New York and various other films would be a recipe for disaster but I was pleasantly surprised with this one. My 17 year old son and I really enjoyed it. The actors are pretty much unknowns in terms of American cinema, with the exception of Bob Hoskins, but they all did a good job.

Amongst these retreads Neil Marshall comes with a creation cluttered with excessive gore, contemptuous savages, and a castle occupied by paranoid freaks. Most films in this once unique sub genre reuse a tired formula of maelstrom and hell fire and are devoid of character or characteristic. Doomsday not only succeeds in putting an inventive twist on the usual, but there's actually some character. In retrospect, the plot is quite diluted, and originality is out of the question here, but several plot points in this film contain some forms of genuine wit and morbid humor. It may not have the same impact as Dog Soldiers, but there is certainly some shock value put forth, at one point in the form of the cooking and devouring of one of the operatives. In conclusion, it's nice to see a revamp of a theme in film regularly calculated rather then created, and innovation is always welcome.",Doomsday

She has that short in the back,long in the front hair that Charlize Theron had in Aeon Flux, but it works better on Rhona Mitra.The violence and gore was more of a comic relief at times. The movie started out on a very serious tone, the 28 Days Later portion of it gave no hint of the ridiculousness that is to come later in the movie.

The rest of the crap in this film aside, I have a big problem with her, as there is no physically possible way that she could do anything that she does.The background is a really stupid plague storyline, beset with sequences of referential winks and blatant copying of story elements in many of the successful or at least infamous action movies of the 80s and 90s.

I figured fine it will suck, but it can't be nearly as bad as the Pathfinder.After seeing the whole film I can say with confidence this is no great gem of a movie (but still way better than the Pathfinder). It was however entertaining and at times had a Paul Verhoven feel to it with surprisingly hilarious scenes that pop out of nowhere.All in all the film has a very 1970s-1980s graphic novel or action movie feel to it. It seems to be saying look we're going to have a really crazy plot that is just a vehicle to show some insanely violent scenes of people dying in horrid ways. Also I wanted to make a movie that combined zombie flicks, mad max movies and just for fu...x sake some medieval knights tossed in for good measure. Lastly, this movie has a surprisingly good sound track. If you like darkwave or post punk you music should be pretty happy with the tracks they play in this film. They else fit the color and style of the film perfectly.Is this a movie you'd want to impress a girl with?

211,MikeRydal,Seen it all before?,6,7 May 2008,"OK, so i have just finished watching this movie and all i could think of is that it lacks originality, the whole premise of the film seems to be ""borrowed"" from at least 4 other films, with obvious similarities between the Mad Max Trilogy and Escape from New York/LA The film also seems to have stolen the character ""Selene"" from the Underworld Trilogy, from attire, personality and even haircut! (Ironically, main star Rhona Mitra, Eden, shall be appearing in Underworld 3, Rise of the Lycans) There was also the feel of 28 Weeks Later, the whole premise of an enclosed area, subject to a killer virus.So let me sum this up. A killer virus has wiped out Scotland and a wall has been erected around, to contain it (28 Weeks Later & Escape From New Yore/LA.) 30 Years later it is found that people have survived, so a cure must exist within the wall. the virus has now spread to London and the cure is needed. Cue Eden, a young, strong, fearless, sexy woman with all the moves (Selene, Underworld) is sent to retrieve it. once there she finds it is overrun by what can only be described as cannibalistic Road Warriors (Mad Max)and it is up to Selene.....Oops, sorry.....Eden to find the cure and save the day! OK, so, scrutiny over, this was actually an enjoyable flick, with enough guns, cars, explosions and with the help Rhona Mitras' costume, it keeps us men happy. Sadly lacking in the ""story line"" department, but still delivers an enjoyable watch.Not really a Cinema worthy feature but definitely one to rent, so get the lads rounds, get the beers in and enjoy this respectable 7 out of 10.",Doomsday
212,videozombi,"So many parts, so much confusion but at least there's....",2,19 July 2008,"I would have loved to finish the summary with something good to say, I really would have. First let's be clear. I love disaster movies and I love Post Apocalyptic disaster movies even more. Mad Max, The Road Warrior, even cheesy movies like Empire of Ash and Def Con 4. I simply love them. So when I saw commercials and trailers for this I really had high hopes. The sight of the Bentley in the previews put me on guard but I decided to let that slide and really looked forward to seeing this. I knew it was going to modernized, but I loved the Resident Evil movies and Ultra Violet so I honestly hoped this would be like them and be worth watching. What I got for all my hopes was a lame, ripped off, boring, tired, dried up over cooked (no pun intended) piece of garbage. It had all the potential in the world and a budget to match. Yet still, this horrible mess was the best they could come up with.First off, we have the obvious attempt at ripping off every Post Apocalyptic movie from Mad Max to Resident Evil. Then we have the lame attempt at a heroine played by a woman who couldn't fill Mila Jovovich's shoes if her life depended on it. Then of course we have Sean Pertwee relegated to the role of a simpering coward, which (through no fault of his) is about as believable as Michale Biehn in a dress playing a transvestite. Why you would throw out the chance to put a guy like Pertwee in the lead role is a total mystery to me. Pertwee is entirely believable as the gruff worn out tired soldier who has to go back in for that last fight to save everything. Or have none of the ""film makers"" ever seen Dog Soldiers? Let's just forget what was probably the oversight of the century and move back to our leading lady shall we? Rhona is believable as dramatic actress who should avoid action movies like the plague, again, no pun intended. The attempt at gender reversal in the movie is obvious, painfully obvious. She's the rough and tumble character (think Mad Max) who's lost her family and has nothing to live for (think Death Wish) and has to save the world. Why, if you were going to have a one woman army like that, you would choose Rhona Mitra as your lead actress I have no idea. Although Rhona isn't quite as bad, I couldn't help but be reminded of Blood Rayne and the god awful attempts at physical prowess Kristanna Loken provided us. Rhona is nowhere near that bad but she's not much better. She obviously has some ability, but nowhere near enough to make her role in Doomsday work. She is never believable as the heroine, never are her battles even remotely realistic and never do you forget your watching choreographed fight scenes. If your lucky you fall asleep. Unfortunately I didn't.One of the least believable scene's is the fight between Rhona Mitra's character and a seven foot tall three hundred pound guy dressed in about eight hundred pounds of metal Armour. Apparently to watch this movie you have to throw common sense out the window. Which I guess I should have because during the entire scene all I kept thinking was ""I'm pretty sure if you bare fist punch solid steel all you'll wind up with is a broken hand"". Not this girl. She can get belted with a spiked Mace full on and come away without a scratch. Well, not quite. At least during that scene Rhona finally gets a cut on her lip... Okay, on to the car because I just can't resist.What are the odds that thirty years after Scotland is sealed off from the outside world by a giant wall, and taken over by gangs of cannibals, a nice pristine 2008 Bentley would survive it all? Not to mention conveniently situated next to barrels full of untouched gasoline and a crate full of neatly packed (activated) satellite phones that still work. Oh, and that a Bentley could ram through a bus and not even damage it's front end...and get rammed by (and into) dozens of Road Warrior type cars and wind up with just a few scratches? You know I could go on, but I won't. I've wasted enough time on this farce of a movie without thinking about it any more. Sure I'll be ranting about it for weeks and throwing myself in front of people's TV sets trying to spare them the anguish of watching it, but that's another story.Maybe if they had cast a woman suitable to the role, this movie might have worked. Maybe if they had at least not tried so very hard to rip off so many other movies, I might have liked it. Maybe if I poke out my eye I can get a cool robotic one like Rhona's character has. Totally pointless but completely stupid at the same time!In all honesty it would seem to me that the Mad Max series is still king of the Post Apocalyptic genre and If this movie is the best that it will go up against in the future, then that title is certainly safe. To the film makers I would say, give us some credit for god's sake. Even Max got shot, beaten to a pulp and could hardly walk by the end of all the movies. Oh, and next time, don't throw away your opportunity to put someone like Pertwee in a role he was born for so you can put people in theater seats to see Rhona's butt in Spandex. It's nice and all but it can't save a movie, at least not this one.",Doomsday
213,paragonofanimals,"Mad Max, Escape from L.A., Doomsday and The Warriors. Which of these films is not like the others?",4,30 September 2008,"I really enjoy those post-apocalyptic 70's/80's films. You know the ones, Mad Max 1,2 & 3, Escape From New York/L.A., The Warriors and well, pretty much a lot of what John Carpenter came out with. So, that combined with how much I enjoyed the directors previous films made me psyched to check this one out. I didn't get a chance to see it in the theater, so, I just saw it on DVD.Alright then, what does this film have that these other films do? It has gore, guns, girls and more. It has the John Carpenter like soundtrack. It has the muscular dudes and chicks(complete with S&M garb). It even has a car chase! The movie has a wounded, emotionally damaged main character (similar to Max & Snake). It even has hints of Alien 2, Excaliber and Gladiator! Hold on--did I just fit all those in one sentence? Yep, but don't poo yourself yet.But, no matter how much my love for cult film is, I just can't enjoy this movie. It feels like a template for a fun/cool action film, but, it's a soulless movie. It takes from all those other films and doesn't add any inspiration of it's own. There is minimal character development, the plot is extremely clumsy. The climax is lame, the payoffs throughout are lame.But in spite of all this I will look forward to Neil Marshall's next film. Visually his films are really good and he proved with The Descent that he can re-work genre and make it his own. I think this was just something that probably should have came later in his career.Sorry, about this one Neil. I'm given it a 4/10 stars.",Doomsday

As soon as I saw the first punk hairstyle, the whole film was destroyed and all credibility lost. Don't waste your time seeing this as the make up and costume departments, writer, producers and Director all bailed out and couldn't be bothered to use ANY imagination whatsoever.
It incenses me beyond belief that nobody involved in this said ""NO!...NO MORE PUNK HAIRSTYLES!""
Throughout the 1950's, nigh on ALL Sci-Fi movies had spacemen in SILVER outfits. How many astronauts in REALITY who went to the Moon wore silver?
EVERYONE in the MAD MAX series of films had bloody silly hairstyles with no explanation whatsoever HOW they cut, blow dried, coloured/dyed, and maintained those cuts in a future without electricity and or dyes or shampoos.
It is SO lazy to not even consider (and thereby be unique) how men and women without even hot water could achieve such fashion. It is so stupid!
Just look how much the budget was and how much the film made! If only somebody could've used a different way of showing a dystopian world and the people/survivors who inhabit it!

How am I expected to enjoy my time, if the movie is a very poor blend of many films past, with nothing new? I HAVE watched those past great films, even if only action-packed they might have appeared to be, enjoyed them very much, thank you, and they, in the end, catapulted themselves into the cult classics that we love so much, best examples of their genre which are to be viewed over and over, anyway.This film, however, has absolutely nothing new or meaningful to add to the mix. It is as if the producers said ""let's take these details out of that movie, and those details out of this one, and make a film... Ooohhh, yeeess, yesssss, the sweet smell of the piles of money the unsuspecting movie-goers will pay us""... I mean, this is ridiculous! And I don't mean that because this is a raw action film and not a decent drama or comedy or historical or a musical piece with a great artistic value. I mean that because this movie just wastes my time with details that just don't fit together, looks like a poor collage, and rips of many good films of the genre.My suggestion to you is, if you want to empty your mind, have some fun and pass some time, at least do it with a film, action or not, which deserves your dough, and doesn't cheat you this cheaply!

I'm disappointed to say it was a bit of a let-down.I had heard a lot of negative publicity about this movie, but I thought I'd give it a shot anyway. And I thought the first 30 minutes or so were great. Surely all the naysayers were wrong, right? Nope.As soon as the script introduces the main villain, Sol, things go downhill fast. He is such an unoriginal, derivative, silly character that you can't take him seriously for a moment. From this point on in the movie, everything we see is an odd mishmash of ideas and scenes from better movies. I lost interest quickly.There was a lot of blood and gore, but it didn't seem to add anything for the story. I seemed as though Neil Marshall said, ""Hmm, let's splatter this scene up here with some guts. I have a few fanboys out there who will like that.""

217,RomeoKnight,Over the top feminist action flick,2,2 July 2018,"Lets start with the good parts. I liked the overall visuals and sets and seemingly this was quite a big budget film minus the actual star actors which were missing. Especially the Mad Max style gang scenes were believable and quite intense. The main baddie could also act (unlike the main heroine). Some of the scenes were pretty cool like the first attack scene from the raiders and there was a sense of danger in it. Overall the acting was hit and miss. Needless to say that the main character was a huge miscast. I haven't seen this wooden and uncharismatic acting since, forever. Malcolm McDowell, a great actor, was mentioned in the initial credits, I waited him, and he had like 5 minutes of screen time. Figures. Mostly it was cringe-worthy performances and cliched dialogue from b-grade actors. The story and screenplay was crazy jumping from futuristic ""Aliens"" style of military stuff towards a zombie flick, and then to Mad Max, and eventually to some medieval castle with knights and all. A lot of it made no sense. I guess they just wanted to show cool scenery and costumes to audience.Action scenes went on and quickly it was made clear that the main lady could take any kind of damage and pretty much kill anybody and everybody. That, and the fact that she was annoying and arrogant bitch made this film lose most of the stars from my eyes. It is very typical in these times to set a woman to be the ""bring best man you can find"" as it was said in the film. Forget the physics and realities, this skinny woman can take down any man twice at her size, even unarmed against steel armor-plated warrior. No problem. Can take full force punches to stomach without any injury. Also she can just run away from motorbike raiders coming right at her. Surely, if this is a superhero film, I'd have no problem with that or anything else happened in the movie. But if you lose believability, you lose everything. Mostly that was because of lazy scripting and when all the suspense and danger disappears, you get numb and bored.As said, there were some cool scenes in this film but they were quickly forgotten by crazy out of place bits. Most definitely, the most ridiculous scene was at the end when the Bentley pierced straight through a bus without even a dent in its bumpers. I guess the bus was made out of paper or something. Just like all the bad guys.Final verdict: 2/10 with the lead actress, 6/10 with Jason Statham.",Doomsday

220,gargamel_gargamel,"Started out... OK, but quickly went downhill",3,18 March 2008,"I didn't expect this movie to be great. And I was right! It had it's moments, but overall it was a disappointment.. I'm all for some poetic license, especially in sci-fi adventure movies.... but this took it way too far for most.At the beginning I'll admit I was somewhat drawn into the storyline despite mostly bad acting. Especially David Ohara's flat boring uninspired unbelievable performance. Also the random topless woman in a bathtub with a shotgun near the beginning just for the sake of nudity. Don't get me wrong... I love nudity, but this just seemed out of place. I first got a little skeptical after the task force made it into the city. They were driving armored tanks built for heavy battle that were even said to be impenetrable to chemical warfare. However, the bad guys took both tanks out with molotov cocktails and broke the windows out of the tanks with... I think rocks or bows and arrows??? So.. the bad guys have been out of contact with the rest of the world for over 25 years and have had no supplies since, yet they have plenty of vehicles (motorcycles, cars, reinforced buses, etc) that still have tires with no dry rot, batteries that haven't gone out, and plenty of fuel it seems. They even have fuel for generators. I'm guessing they are using generators for the electricity they do still have that they use for loud music and stage lights at their gatherings. I also find it odd that the satellite imagery just found them in the last 3 years even though there are hundreds (possibly thousands) of survivors that have been running around Scotland for over 25 years using cars and trains, etc.So.... I suspended disbelief for a while, what's the hurt in that? Then our heroes are led to a castle where the other clan of survivors are living.... in full medieval garb using nothing but medieval weapons and horses... apparently they DON'T have any gas out here. (Oh, and if the bad guys all have cars/gas/etc, why don't any of them have any weapons, reminds me of I Am Legend.. where the good guys find plenty of guns/ammo, but the bad guys can't seem to... although here the good guys brought it in with them... you get the point).Then when our heroes are escaping from the castle it comes under attack from something... lots of explosions, yet we see no attackers... what exactly were they under attack from?? They flee under the mountain through a fallout shelter that we're told some have used ""many times"" yet never looked in any of the hundreds of crates to find any supplies.... after firing up a generator (he sure found that easy... AND it still works!!) they bust open some crates, fire up a pristine condition Bentley and off they go... Battery wasn't dead, full of gasoline and all of the parts still work after 25 years... wow. Our hero plugs in a cell phone she just found and calls back to London.... with no service package... and then they drive the Bentley through an impossible fight (bad guys IN the car in front of the driver for what seemed like 5 minutes of screen time). Ultimately they only had to fight because this nice Bentley was caught up to by an old clunker that has been being worn out for 30 years and ultimately t-bone a bus with it and simply drive through the bus leaving the Bentley in still perfect condition... nice.And the ending sucks.... it is dreadfully cheesy and downright insulting.If you want to see killing for the sake of killing, go see shoot 'em up as another commenter said, but don't waste your time on this.I gave it a 3 because I was pulled in for a while and it has some decent scenes, especially in the first half.",Doomsday

This director has no imagination whatsoever to rip off from these movies in such a way.
Nonetheless, for those who have not seen any of these movies, it is a mildly entertaining flick. As long as you don't support the director by actually spending money on it ;)

When i saw it some years ago, i had the impression it was 2 movies in one. The first part of the movie resides on the usual military virus containment plot, while the second just goes berserk into post-apocalyptical filled with gore.
The first part you will find plot holes and the usual virus/zombie epidemic. But the second one, was something i didn't see it coming. That's where the action takes place and it's non-stop til the end of the movie.It's not a masterpiece, far from it, but it's damn entertaining and you gotta give credit for making such a movie in a genre that has been exploited that people started to avoid movies about zombies.

This was such a bad movie, I immediately had to see what the collective IMDb members had to say. I'm sorry but with an average rating of 6/10, I am no longer certain I can trust any IMDb rating that is less than an 8/10. I am giving it a 4 ONLY because Rhona Mitra (and a few others) are pretty good actors, the action scenes are intense (albeit ridiculous), and the set designs are pretty good. It gets a ZERO for the absolutely ridiculous story line, the many plot holes, and the over-empathizes on the removal of a particular body part. Some science (or sort of) to remember: - Fuel (or Petro) will not work after 30 years (much less after 1 year); - It is highly unlikely that: a modern society will break down as depicted in this movie, especially not in a short time;international aid will not come; - Who is running the power stations?

That's when a girl that narrowly escaped the quarantine (that is now a counter terrorist agent), which is the main protagonist, is sent in to retrieve a cure that the UK govt. thinks there is due to survivors showing up on satellite imagery.The movie has potential on paper and story wise, but the plot drags on way too long (2hrs) & it's like a fusion between Mad Max, Resident Evil + King Arthur, in the sense that Scotland is now ruled by 2 entities: a Mad Max type society that's cannibalistic and a Medieval style society at the other end.

But this is painful to watch for so many reasons to list that I will only focus on the one which interests me.. the ""captain of the ship"" aka lead actress.

Intelligence of an individual permeates into the role when it's a one-person show so I can't believe there were no debates about the validity and appeal of this ""eyeball camera""... kinda wacky but intriguing the first time around but after all, it IS 2035 - surely a camera would be more logical? If they shoot the camera, fine but if they shoot your prostehtic eyeball you're kind of screwed...

I'm going to give lots of spoilers, so no one is ever tempted ever to watch this stinker.There were only five people in the theater when I saw this movie, and for good reason.It kind of wanted to be a Mad Max sort of movie but it's just a mish mash of crap.It has a great cast - Rhona Mitra and Bob Hoskins - but what a waste! It starts okay - a deadly virus outbreak in Glasgow Scotland (those darn Scots!) causes those darn British (those darn Brits) to build a wall all the way around Scotland so no one gets in or out. 30 years later (or maybe it was 29 years later) the virus is discovered in England. Lo and behold, satellite images show (are you ready?) PEOPLE ALIVE IN Scotland!! Naturally, the good Prime Minister of England (played by Dr. Bashir, Alexander Siddig) wants to send a small team into Scotland to find out why some survived. He asks Bob Hoskins to find someone to lead the team. You think maybe he'll choose Rhona Mitra, who was separated from her mother in an evacuation of Scotland and wants back in so she can look for her mother? In the meantime, we are treated to fingers graphically being cut off in closing doors, a rabbit graphically being blown to pieces by an automated guard tower, the graphic sight of the leftovers of a road kill cow, people being graphically beheaded, another one gets graphically barbecued and a piece of his flesh is offered to Rhona Mitra, who by now has been captured by the survivors in Scotland, and other gross bits. One of the other prisoners is the sister of the leader of the gang of survivors, and they are both the children of Malcolm McDowell, who plays a scientist who survived the virus. As it turns out, science had nothing to do with the survival. It was all natural selection.oh yeah - I forgot to mention - the good PM gets splatted with infected blood, so he graphically commits suicide.Anyway, Rhona Mitra and some of the guys in her team - the vehicles in which they travel to Scotland are super armored impregnable forces but somehow a rock manages to shatter a windshield of one of the vehicles - so some of them are captured by Malcolm McDowell - and they get thrown in his prison - oh Malcolm tortures his own daughter - and Malcolm lives in a castle and they all dress in medieval garb - oh why go on?

I myself was rooting for our lady hero to succeed and in that she did so quite well but I am in for a story and this story was in many ways lacking. I do recommend a person to see this movie but do not expect the suspense of a movie like 28 days or 28 weeks later. The reason I have placed this movie with such a low rating was for the writing behind the movie even if the writing was not as bad as the visual plot of underworld it still left something to be seen. I personally will not be enjoying this movie again any time soon. Yes there was some good interconnections between the characters in the quarantine zone but it was because or direct relationships blood links not because of any type of plot score. Sorry but this movie is a turkey when it comes to the story. I did enjoy the action and there was a few things I haven't seen since blade runner but they could have done them much better not left such weak links between fantasy and reality sorry but that is just my opinion,Doomsday

If you rent this movie, do not expect to see anything new under the sun. Every character and every group in the movie is completely generic, and seems to be ripped from other movies. The plot is stupid, so very very stupid. The only thing that surprises me in the movie is how little they have done to add to the genre. It is completely forgettable. Every little detail in it was painfully clichéd. And some of them were not thought properly through. For example, in one scene, a screaming head is flying at the camera. No body. Just the head, screaming, completely oblivious to the fact that you would need some sort of air supply through you throat, in order to say anything.

234,dollypeppers,Incoherent Mess of Ideas That Was Done Better In the Movies It Stole Them From,1,24 August 2017,"I don't typically like to leave wholly negative reviews but what the crap this movie was all kinds of terrible. The writing was seriously sub-par which dragged the already meh story down a few hundred notches, the acting varied from just okay to awful, and the idea itself was bad.First it seems like it's going to be an epidemic movie to the tune of 28 Days Later, or maybe the Resident Evil franchise. Whatever the plague is, it's fast and ugly. We fast forward in time somewhat while listening to an overly dramatic and irritating voice-over into a futuristic dystopia. So that's our movie right? WRONG! Suddenly we dive into a coke-induced Mad Max apocalypse, where people have been cut off for 30 years from all contact with the outside world yet still manage to gather hairstyling supplies so they can gel and dye their enormous mohawks. Did I mention they eat people? Because they mention they eat people, about half a hundred times. We get it, these Road Warrior rejects are cannibals. We didn't need the several minutes of them cooking and eating one of the soldiers to know that. So these are our antagonists. But wait no! Our headstrong heroine escapes the band of multicolored man-eaters only to find a renaissance fair has established itself in a nearby castle, run by one of the most obviously evil doctors I've ever seen and his scowling henchman. They host a Gladiator style fight with the protagonist and a really bulky armored dude, which of course she wins because she's the protagonist and in the process of escaping one of her fellow soldiers(whom the directing seems to think is her love interest by the way they shoot the scenes) gets pumped full of arrows thanks to this universe's version of the Sheriff of Nottingham or whatever he's supposed to be. So our knock-off Alice avenges him and-oh wait no she doesn't. They just leave. They don't bother to take out the King Arthur wannabe or anything.Now it's the return of the punk rock people-eaters, as they somehow manage to gather together the prop cars that were abandoned Beyond Thunderdome and there's a car chase with far too many explosions and not enough reason why or how they're here.Finally the REAL VILLAIN is revealed! Oh no the obviously evil guy with the dark sunglasses and government connections who has been dropping hints the whole movie about how he orchestrated the quarantine breech was behind it all? You don't say. But our girl records him with her prosthetic eye-cam(which was the only part of the movie I liked) and thus the day is saved! Our hero can find her mom! Or not, maybe she'll find a decapitated head and get herself elected queen of the cannibals. THE END.Everything that is good about this movie is cribbed from better movies. There's a fine line between paying homage and ripping things off and Doomsday staggers drunkenly all over the line before sliding over it like it's home plate. Neil Marshall what happened man? I liked Dog Soldiers. The Descent was fine for the first half of the movie. Why is spew out this garbage? Bob Hoskins is wasted in his small role as Eden's mentor and Alexander Siddig is even more wasted as a character whose sole purpose seems to be to kill himself so a suicide can be carefully shot. Why?Don't watch this movie. Watch Road Warrior instead. Watch Gladiator instead. Watch anything else but this movie.",Doomsday
235,stuartdr,Plot less ridiculousness that is fun to watch,7,29 March 2008,"After The Descent, which got extremely extremely good reviews, director Neil Marshall now come to viewers with his film Doomsday. Overall the film is something that combines aspects of many popular genres and mash into one film which lacks development.The story starts in a 28 Days Later-esquire plot with Scotland being plagued by a virus known as the Reaper Virus. Due to the spread of the virus, Scotland is contained and the citizens of Scotland are left to die from the virus. Years later,when the virus worms its way into parts of London, a group of special forces members are sent into Scotland to find a cure for the Reaper Virus. Nothing new or mind blowing regarding plot.The opening to the film is one of the strongest point. It is exciting, realistic and starts the film in a very good foot. However, as the main group of characters enter Scotland, things get pretty standard. Limbs flying, people getting smashed with blunt objects, blood and guts are all of the film. But these action sequences, despite being things seen in many different films, is pretty fun to watch. The main problem I found with the film is its flat boring characters. The characters are killed off pretty quickly and you don't care for any of them. It is just feels like the sole purpose of the characters are to be killed off.Plot gets pretty absurd during the 2nd part of the story too. If you put even an ounce of common sense into the film, it can be seen how paper thin the plot is and how ridiculous it is. The climax involves a extremely big car chase. This part is actually very fun to watch. It's violent, brutal, funny (in a very sick way) and exciting. A basic way to explain the film is a mix of 28 Days Later, Mad Max, Lord of the Rings and Gladiator. With a very standard, flat uninteresting characters and absurd plot, Doomsday is a film to be watched for the fun, violent and over the top action and not much else.",Doomsday
236,Ultimex_Varptuner,Gratifying from Beginning to End.,9,3 June 2008,"Do you remember the glory days of action films? Predator, Robocop, Mad Max and all the hundreds off knock offs that at the time felt lousy but compared to todays cash-bloated, egocentric, star-vehicle, CGI riddled Hollywood crud-fests were spot on? Course you do.Let me tell you: I damn well love Neil Marshall.I love him.Marshall is a guy who has enough talent to make a variety of different ideas work and yet at the same time never gets given enough money for his films to become too grandiose and self indulgent. After sitting enthralled through three of his films I can honesty say that I don't want this guy to ever be at the helm of a super-budget movie. I think more money would ruin it.While his previous outings Dog Soldiers and the phenomenal The Descent harked back to old-school, dingy, downbeat British horror, Doomsday evolves by taking that grime, that darkness and fusing it to an apocalyptic view of Great Britain and specifically Scotland.As mentioned elsewhere this film fuses elements of Mad Max, 28 Days Later, Escape from New York and Aliens (I refer to the initial infiltration scenes in the hospital) to come up with something truly entertaining and special.Given Hollywood's current penchant for remakes, self reference and the achingly pathetic concept of the 'reboot' it's easy to see how this could have been an appallingly bad movie trading on past glories and desperately treading water. Instead it represents a return to the glorious, high octane, ridiculous action movies of yesteryear where ornately designed sets, cool vehicles and amusing deaths were every bit as important as political correctness and gratifying the ego of the leading actors.As I mentioned before Doomsday is given strength by the constraints of it's budget. While showing a derelict, overgrown Glasgow in broad daylight would have dictated expensive and cheapening CGI effects Marshall instead uses dark, atmospheric and spectacularly well designed sets to tell the story. From the tribal Thunderdome-esquire Glaswegian interiors to a medieval castle and an underground storage facility borrowed from Romero's Day of the Dead things look universally incredible with more detail than the eye can take on one watch alone.Similar efforts have been made in the costume department with Glasgow's strangely attractive looking Gothic cyberpunk tribes people hijacking the limelight during most of their screen time. Duly noted too was a gleefully insane and always scene stealing turn by Craig Conway as Sol.Despite a few bits of clunky B-movie grade acting from the supporting cast there is little not to be liked about the film and as it rocketed towards a highway climax that came across as a loving homage to Mad Max 2  The Road Warrior I found myself wishing that I could flip the disk back to the beginning and start over.It really is that good.",Doomsday

The main characters are brave which makes the movie a little more enjoyable. There is a big car chase scene in this movie which had some pretty cool deaths.

239,jonnyreggay1,Can't make its mind up what it want's to be!!,5,3 November 2008,"This movie starts off really well, and had me quite gripped for the first half. The second half has quite a few flaws in my opinion. I would describe this movie as a blend of Mad Max, 28 Days later and Dog Soldiers. The problem is i don't think the second half of the movie could decide what it was. It drifts from serious to the down-right silly. Dog Soldiers was thoroughly entertaining for what it was, but it was supposed to be humorous and not taken seriously. This movie starts serious, with a viral epidemic wiping out the whole of Scotland, and re-emerging to threaten the downfall of England. Millions dead from horrific and violent deaths. It continues in a similar fashion, for most of the movie. It has an interesting look into society of the future, and what it could be like if people were left with no laws or functional government. Very much like Mad Max. However some parts were just a bit strange, like the dancing on the stage before the cannibal feast? Was this supposed to be ridiculous? Then it goes back to relatively serious again, until a knight rides in on a horse, with a lance?? WTF!!?? There are two different societies that have been formed. However, usually one would expect that one group would be harmless and non-violent, and the other more criminalised. In this case, both groups are violent and primitive. The other group seem more ridiculous and unbelievable though, with their living area looking more like the set from Braveheart. This is the start of the downfall for me. A daring escape follows from here which is quite good, until they happen to stumble across a Bentley sports car in a container. Maybe it was left for someone important to escape in during all of the research into a cure for the virus, but it isn't really explained. The mad max car chase which follows is very entertaining and enjoyable until the most ridiculous thing happened which in my opinion took it too far and ruining the movie. Real music was brought into the film which moved away from the darker background score used for the rest of the film. And quite possibly the worst song that could've been chosen, Two Tribes go to war by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. It made a complete laughing stock of the film and pushed it more and more towards comedy than horror-action. If it had made up its mind to go one way or the other it could have been great. For example, it should have left out the stupid music that made me cringe, and left out some of the weird dancing on the stage. Mad max was a cult classic series, that cannot really be re-created. It shouldve tried to stay more original. In summary, first half great, second half was just silly.",Doomsday
240,rick-992,Oh dear Oh dear!,3,9 May 2008,"*** SPOILERS *** Well as another reviewer said, a combination of 28 Days/Weeks Later, Mad Max 3 and Braveheart. And featuring the Gimp from Pulp Fiction.But what what a poor combination! Absolutely laughable most of the way through. Nearly a walk-out from me, which is very rare indeed. This movie makes 28 Weeks Later seem like an Oscar candidate. Groan! Top marks to Alexander Siddig for an all too brief but decent performance. Also excellent were Emma Cleasby as the main character and Bob Hoskins as the chief of police. These performances earn the film 2 stars. Miss Cleasby was very reminiscent of Kate Beckinsale in Underworld (yum!). I'll award a final star for the Bentley which was pretty cool and drew admiring gasps from the audience who like me were clearly hoping for some exciting action.Particularly memorable (for all the wrong reasons) was the scene where (one) of the bad-guys dances around to Bad Manners' ""Can Can"" accompanied by several ""Rab C Nesbitt"" characters in kilts and other assorted lovelies. What was the writer/director thinking? What were the financiers thinking? I suppose it did bring new insight into the myth that Glaswegians are prepared to eat anything so long as it's deep fried.The car chase scenes (with the aforementioned Bentley) were almost good, but totally ruined by the Bentley being out-paced by a Glasgow Taxi, an old Rover 3000 police car, a VW Beetle and what may have been an old VW sportster. This along with the ""dance"" scene are blatant rip-offs from Mad Max 3. This is not homage. It's garbage.I don't see anything in this film for anyone. Visuals and plot were just a complete joke (in the worst way). And not much in the way of gore for horror fans either. Not funny. Not homage. Not even so bad it's good. Just plain awful.Avoid.

241,LeonardPine,A guilty pleasure,6,22 October 2009,"After the superbly scary 'The Descent' director Marshall seems to have taken a step back with this mish mash of Escape From NY and Mad Max 2. There's not an ounce of originality in this as Marshall nicks quite shamelessly the plot of Escape From NY, and populates the exclusion zone with outdated punk designed rejects from The Mad Max films. Our heroine Rhona Mitra even sports an eye patch at certain moments! Having said that, there is much to enjoy in Doomsday. Laughing along at the silly plot the film moves at a relentless pace and its never boring.The action set-pieces are very good and the mayhem is very violent and gory. There's even a medieval sequence that is the films one surprising moment that includes a brutal duel between our heroine and a huge bloke in armour! Rhona Mitra makes a fine action heroine and knocks the anorexic looking Jolie into a cocked hat. The dialog she's given is pretty bad but she delivers the lines with a straight face while keeping her tongue firmly in her cheek. The physical action she handles very well and the tight black outfit she wears for most of the film is very easy on the eye!This is a well made film and Marshall is obviously a very talented filmmaker, but hopefully his next film will be something original, now that he's got his 'homage' film out of the way. Although he's obviously a big John Carpenter fan which is fair enough.

You want to watch this movie. If you go into the movie thinking, wow, just another zombie movie, or just another plague wiping the humanity off the face of the earth movie, you'll be severely misguided. DO NOT GO INTO THIS MOVIE THINKING THAT YOU WILL FIND A BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN MOVIE. There are more plot holes in it than swiss cheese, but they do not try to hide the holes. In fact, they throw them into your face and you laugh because of it. The action is ridiculous, but in that you will find yourself on a hilarious ride of amusement. The script is actually not horrible, and the acting isn't as bad as you'd imagine. They could have made it into a terrifying version of the same movie with just a little different direction, but in that there would have been no distinction from this movie and all of the copycat apocalypse movies that have been released recently.The movie starts off quite serious, and you find yourself thinking, ""wow, this movie is really f-ed up."" Then about 1/2 hour into it something shifts and you start asking yourself what the director can do to make things any stranger than they already are - and he does. 3/4 of the way through, you should be laughing hysterically and not caring whether or not the action sequences are realistic - you just tell the part of your brain that should be rebelling and screaming at you to leave the theatre to shut up because the side of your brain that controls laughter is having too much of a good time.Don't watch this movie alone.

I loved the sheer audacity of this movie. Yes, there is no coherent logic to this film. Yes, there is a bare thread of a simplistic plot. Yes, the film veers from one idea to the next with nary a connective tissue, but damn if this film doesn't play out like a little kid have so much fun in the sandbox.Watching this film is essentially watching a filmmaker who loves to make and watch movies make an insane homage to the great post-apocalyptic genre. If you try to think logically about this film your brain will hurt. Why are the neo-punks cannibalistic when there are apparently thousands of cows? Why is an electric sign flashing during a car chase when there is no electricity? Why is there a rig for a gimp rigged up on the front of a car? Did the punks think to themselves that there may be a use for something like that? Who cares!!! This movie is about as brainless as many other films like ""Transformers"" (sheer drek), but in my opinion it achieves what it sets out to do like similar films, ""Crank"" and ""Shoot 'em Up"" come to mind. I can't wait for this film to come out on DVD, and since the film did feel a bit disjointed I'm expecting that there will be a director's cut that will improve this film.Not a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but I loved the hell out of it and it will find a much deserved home in my movie collection.

Acting is actually pretty decent for the quality of characters and ""dialog"" the actors were given, and entertaining to watch. Some nice songs along the way, although some of them didn't feel like they fit perfectly. Plot is way out there, but a good portion of it can be swallowed by granting the writers enough artistic license (ignoring armored vehicles that can be penetrated by throwing a stone, or non-armored vehicles driving through other vehicles without any damage). There's even some humor, I mean you can't take seriously a scene with a guy getting knocked out with a fish.Now the gore... it would make Tarantino movies (and any other movie I've ever seen) G-rated by comparison.

247,jeepcj5guy,Mad Max Meets a Big Pile of Lame,3,8 August 2008,"I certainly didn't rent this movie expecting anything good, just something mildly entertaining. What I received was slightly less than entertaining. In this Mad Max wannabe film, mohawked road-warriors have simply been replaced with slightly more stylish, punk-looking freaks with equally overdone mohawks, copious piercings and unrealistically flawless tattoos. How these people got ahold of all the tattoo guns and yet have no actual firearms is beyond me. How these club-swinging, Molotov-throwing ruffians are somehow starving and forced to subsist on human flesh yet the protagonists drive through a herd of cattle prior to entering post-apocalyptic Glasgow is also beyond my comprehension.I think the writers may have smoked a little too much weed while creating the script. I can picture one of them in his living room, lips pressed to a two-foot bong, thinking""Cannibals. That's it! That's how we make it stand out from Mad Max. Genius!"" The plot holes and inanities continue throughout the rest of the film. Even the music was lame. They could have at least included some good heavy metal. Well, the chick with all the face tats is hot, until she gets beheaded of course. If you dig B-grade splatter horror/action with a Hollywood blockbuster budget, you might actually enjoy this film (as it seems other reviewers have). Otherwise, your time might be better spent sitting on the toilet or mowing the lawn.",Doomsday
248,Blue_Martian,Avoid and watch MadMax again.. this is just bad,3,4 August 2008,That so many people have actually given this film a high rating is inexplicable. I watched this because the IMDb rating was pretty decent and I'm a big fan of the B action movie genre. What a disappointment.It starts off well and looks to be building to be a decent movie. Unfortunately the writer just ran out ideas quite early and it appears decided that you may as well try to copy a successful movie if you have no ideas of your own.Because I'm a fan of this type of film I really try not to pick this kind of movie apart because you kinda know you're expecting some semi mindless fun. Well I didn't have to worry about it because this movie just fell apart on it's own. This movie is sooooo full of holes it doesn't even come close to making sense. Scene after scene has continuity errors and the entire premise of the movie is just not possible.The really sad thing is that this isn't even a totally low budget film! You could be a bit more forgiving if you knew they only had 10 or 20 thousand to make this but it's obvious they had much much more.The one bright spot is the makeup and costumes were well done and some of the action sequences were well put together. Which is the only reason I don't give this movie a 1.,Doomsday
249,coco200066,My review....,8,18 March 2008,"Absolutely LOVED this movie. It has been along time since we had a decent,intelligent blood and gore flick. The way Hollywood has been pumping out crappy moves of this genre, I thought I would never see a another good one anytime soon! I found this movie to be very well thought out,well acted, by great actors doing their job! Sure there where a couple of little things that could have been handled better, for example the window breaking a bit too easily on the army vehicle, little things like that however it was just such a very good and enjoyable movie for me that it was easy enough to over look those kind of things.Sure there where a lot of familiar themes from movies past, like Thunder Dome, Escape from New York, Resident Evil, 28 days to name a few, however this movie very expertly managed to go from what could have been just a another ""repetitious blood and gore flick"", to instead, a well acted and believable blood and gore flick.After all I think any fan of this genre knows that pretty much all story arcs have been used by now, so if we want to keep seeing movies of this type produced, it is just a matter of making the next movie seem that much more interesting even with the familiar themes present.IMHO, for the genre that it is, they did this and did it well! Loved it and totally recommend this movie.......and what about that car chase!",Doomsday
250,The_Mob_Has_Spoken,So who told this movie's producers that the Special Olympics gave out film awards?,6,16 March 2008,"This movie plays like a what-not-to-do list for filmmakers: DO NOT plagiarize EVERY SINGLE SCENE from superior films (I mean this literally; I can't wait for the lawsuits to start flying); DO NOT make ""Waterworld"" look innovative and brilliant by way of comparison; DO NOT cast Malcolm McDowell if you want the audience to take your movie seriously; etc.And yet, I must admit that I had fun watching this complete turd. Sure it's schadenfreude, but for some viewers, it might be enough. I gave it 4 out of 10 stars for this aforementioned ""how bad can it be?/ you won't believe how awful it is"" phenomenon.",Doomsday
251,kallepalli-sashank,"At the risk of a clichéd plot, Neil Marshall shows Paul W.S. and Len Wiseman how it's done.",8,10 September 2012,"Well,in the past decade or so we have seen a wave of films based on an ""apocalypse"" or a ""world ridden by virus with the lone survivors fighting it"" genres. Series like Underworld and Resident Evil have consistently kept going right at it and spoiling the flavor which was once regarded as unique and imaginative,at the same time raking big-time box office successes.But when I came across this film and read the plot,the first reaction was ""Aw,another clichéd storyline just with a little more zest and action,though the rating was good"". I still had my eye on the fact that it was Neil Marshall who made it. Then when I was slowly becoming a fanatic of his work,I decided to give it a try.Common,we have to give it to him..the guy showed us that action isn't just big blokes with big guns meeting big fiends..he spun a new web on it creating another genre called ""Action,electrified"". What I am trying to say is that if you have seen Dog Soldiers or The Descent,you will clearly say that it takes a sheer genius to make a clichéd and stereotyped story still look good. But that's the thing about Neil Marshall...simplicity with some added zest..So I decided to watch Doomsday and let me tell you I had my money's worth.It follows the same old plot about a virus which has broken loose,the only difference is that the isle of Scotland is the victim, there's a cure out of nowhere in the form of immune humans,while the rest have turned into psychopathic cannibals. And here we have the sensual , action-pumping Rhona Mitra who does the job...brilliantly. To start with,the soundtrack is nothing short of electrifying...the direction is actually,flawless...like we've seen in Marshall's previous flicks...and the icing on the cake is the action sequencing and direction with Marshall's fast-motion action sequencing which floored us in dog soldiers and the descent...I mean some of the scenes just blew me far away...and some scenes drew a smile of admiration..I won't throw more light on the plot because it,like you all must be knowing by now,is thin but with some twists here and there which would actually elongate the story but it made the movie even more fun. The star of the movie had to be Rhona Mitra who charms you with her awesome screen presence and was truly a terminator with a better balance of emotion. She meets her character requirements brilliantly and in her fight sequences makes our underworld's very own Selene look like soft candy. Darren Morfitt ,star from Dog Soldiers,is in this movie too adding the good old quirkiness that he entertained us with in Dog Soldiers.Three cheers to Neil Marshall for delivering yet another gem of a movie. I hope this review is convincing enough and trust me when you watch this movie you'll have your money's worth.Would have given it a 9 or a 10,but for the plot.Still is a fantastic must-not-miss flick and a thriller-mimic ride.",Doomsday
252,nicolasmarinus,Great promotional film commanded by the British Heritage!,3,11 April 2009,"Because that's what it is really. Think about it: It's got London in it, barbaric Scottish tribes, Orwell's 1984, punks, knights, a Bentley, Lord of the rings, steam engines, Bob Hoskins, ... All of them British milestones! Aside from all discussions whether or not this is just a blatant copy of Mad Max (down to individual shots) or an homage, Doomsday fails for one single reason.It doesn't know what it wants to be.It starts off as a very serious post-apocalyptic virus-out-of-control film. It then becomes a Mad Max copy, turns into a medieval Lord of the Rings epic, loops back to Mad Max kitsch and rounds everything up, back in Orwell's 1984's mob-against-the-government style, with one more hasty (and completely ridiculous) jump into Mad Max-land.Seeing Mad Max battle freaks too incredible to be real was great because it was a closed and very consistent universe. Doomsday on the other hand mixes this pseudo-reality with the real world as we know it today and the two (three if you count the medieval section) just don't match! I mean, they escape knights on horseback with a Bentley only to be pursued by crazy punks in eighties throwback vehicles? Defend it all you want, for me it is an epic failure.(The photography though is fantastic!)",Doomsday
253,purplestickydemon,Marshall's Worst,2,18 May 2008,Dog Soldiers was amazing the Descent was also fantastic but i knew that Neil MArshall would come acropper at some point and sadly this is it.The Trailer looked pretty good the film is just a mess from the basic write ups and the trailer you think this is gonna be Mad Max meets Escape from New York which seemed OK but what do we get? 28 Days Later meets Underworld meets Escape From New York meets Mad Max meets Hills have eyes meets speed.and as much as a combination of those movies sounds good it really isn't the one thing this movie does do is contribute to the worst villains of alltime list with the Terrible SAUL so bad he could be a contender for Bennet(Commando) crown.,Doomsday
254,rcp02,"Mostly stolen from other movies, and done poorly",4,2 June 2010,"Looks like mostly another post-apocalyptic movie, with many shots clearly stolen from Mad Max movies and Escape From New York. Only pretty poorly done. Don't tell me you find a whole post-apocalyptic government hideout and NOT go looking for guns...never mind having a gsm network still functioning 30 years after the whole of Scotland was abandoned. Some scenes are so clearly stolen you could almost drop Mel Gibson or Kurt Russell in and not notice, its a complete ripoff.Now, if it is done well, then it doesn't make the movie bad by definition. But it is done pretty damn bad. Buy a brand new Bentley, and then very carefully open all the side windows in your air-conditioned luxury vehicle, otherwise the bad guys cant jump in you see? Also, a scrapheap love-bug weighing at most 800 kilos wont exactly be able to prevent itself from being driven off the road by a 2 ton Bentley.I can probably list about 20 other things that are totally wrong with this movie. Lets just say it starts pretty good...violent and bloody, but still pretty well done. The premise is clearly stolen from Escape From New York, with the virus only as a drop-in replacement for crime. Thats not a problem by itself, but it starts to go pretty much downhill from the opening scenes. Somewhere halfway the movie stopped being exciting at all and started becoming totally predictable.You also have your very typical (for lousy scriptwriting) leave-the-bad-guy-alive-so-he-can-kill-some-sidekick-in-another-scene stuff happening several times. Sorry, doesn't work.Still, the acting by itself isn't that bad, and the action scenes are done well, so its not a complete waste of time. Just don't expect anything but a B-rated movie.",Doomsday

Other movies take inspiration, ideas or even scene ideas from other movies so Doomsday has some defence, even if it is bordering on court action.The problem is not with the moral nature of ripping from other films but the problems it creates. The film has no tone, it is a carrier bag of sick, the swallowing and regurgitating of so many other ideas gives it no feel of its own.The most interesting characters are those that are left behind in London and one feels that is also the more interesting story but sadly it is used as window dressing to a DVD collection of favourite bits.",Doomsday
256,philip-caveney,A major Disappointment,3,12 June 2008,"Writer/director Neil Marshall has been responsible for two of the best low budget horror movies of recent years. In Dog Soldiers, he melded the combat film with the werewolf movie and came out with something startlingly good. In The Descent, he crafted what was quite simply one of the scariest films of all time. So what then are we to make of Doomsday? This futuristic shocker features an amalgam of scenes lifted wholesale from other (frankly better) films to be specific, 28 Days Later, Aliens, Escape From New York, Army of Darkness and Mad Max 2;The Road Warrior. They're all here and all of them are instantly recognisable, so much so that you cannot pass it off as coincidence. Some viewers will utter the word 'homage,' but the less charitable among us will prefer to say 'rip-off.'It's 2035 and a virulent virus has turned Scotland into a massive isolation centre peopled by mad, tattooed warriors no great change there then. When the virus unexpectedly reoccurs in London, bad-ass female cop, Eden (Rona Mitra) is recruited by her boss (Bob Hoskins) to go over the wall into Scotland in the hope of finding an antidote. She takes with her a crack team of soldiers and of course, her detachable eyeball, which can see round corners and relay images to her wristwatch. (Don't ask.) She soon comes into contact with a savage band of cannibals, who intend to use her as a means to get over the wall into England, where presumably there will be more flesh on offer. She also encounters a bunch of people who are living as feudal knights out in the highlands. They are led by Markus Kane (Malcolm McDowell in full scenery chewing mode) a former scientist turned lord of the manor and a strict disciplinarian. Much mayhem ensues and the blood flows freely. There are decapitations, shootings, stabbings and poor Sean Pertwee ends up as the main course at the wildest barbecue you ever saw.As you watch Doomsday unfold, you can't stop asking yourself what Marshall hoped to accomplish here. The film must have had a decent budget and it looks great. Furthermore, he has an undeniable flair for action sequences. But though the film can never be accused of being dull, neither does it feature anything that is remotely surprising, largely because you've seen it all before. In the case of the climactic car chase, it is quite simply, Mad Max 2, down to the last detail. It's as though Marshall decided to recreate key scenes from all his favourite movies and while you grudgingly admit, he's done a fair job of copying them, you can't help yearning for a bit of originality, something that his last two films had in abundance.This feels like a serious hiccup in his career  and some murmurings about a planned sequel to The Descent don't bode well for his next offering either. The suspicion is that he's mirroring John Carpenter's career, a director who was brilliant when he had no money, but whose output became increasingly dismal as his budgets grew in size. It's a shame because few British directors get the autonomy to make films on this scale. My fingers are crossed for his future career, but on the strength of Doomsday, my expectations are not high.",Doomsday
257,wikkit27,Modern mix of past success,5,16 March 2008,"If you're in the mood for some sort of action flick, and if you can stomach the sight of cannibalism, then Doomsday might suit your needs.This movie is a modernized attempt at The Road Warrior, and Rhona Mitra (the heroin) is the new Madam Max. Instead of a nuclear Holocaust (which sets the stage for Mad Max), Neil Marshall (Director) uses some vaguely explained virus to create his almost barren wasteland in northern Scotland. Throw in a bad-ass female mercenary and some cars, and pooof! A wanna-be Mad Max.Rhona Mitra is certainly enjoyable to watch. Top grade ""eye"" candy if you ask me. Her acting is good enough. Probably the best her character would allow. This also had the feel of the movie Underworld. Kate Beckinsale and Rhona Mitra could be sisters if I didn't know better. All in all, this movie is not going to make too much money for lack of a stable story. If you're going to just build a wall around the entire region of Scotland and just leave it alone forever, then why not just nuke the damned place and destroy the virus altogether?If I were to rate this movie for raw action and cheap entertainment, then I would give it a 8/10.

The main two influences are Escape from New York (for the most part of the film) & the great car chase at the end of mad max 2 (so much as to name 1 character(John) Carpenter & (George) Miller & other references. on their own the action scenes (& gory deaths) & post apocalyptic Scotland & the action scenes & car chases are entertaining, but where it falls down hard is the script, almost as if a 13 year old wrote it,putting all his favourite bits of other films into one film & disregarded how to make sense of the plot & how to get from one scene to another.Anyone like me who has Enjoyed Mr Marshall's films previously, will enjoy spotting the actors from his previous movies & the subtle name references (such as Sterling for the lad who played Spoon in Dog soldiers etc)It's a film I really want to like, but due to the bad story used to wedge the good action scenes, It leaves you feeling not quite satisfied.",Doomsday

Doomsday is a full on action movie, but it contains elements of cyberpunk sci-fi, gory effects and deaths, medieval knights, a few minutes of Mad Max, and a few other things that I can't remember.

It is a movie that shows you can take the best elements from different sci-fi action movies and blender them up into a really fun frothy bloody good time. Rhona Mitra is excellent as the modern Snake Plissken- Eden Sinclair. And she fights the good fight throughout the film. With swords and axes. And kudos to director Neil Marshall for never making her a sex object in her battles. She just kicks butt. She ventures into a Closed off Country looking for a cure to a deadly and disgusting disease. London officials believe there are survivors who may have it. In goes Eden with her team only to find the country has split into two. Those who live in medieval times - complete with castle and sword. And those who live in post Apocalypse - complete with Mohawk and .. oh yeah sword. Either way no one is friendly.

I wouldn't go as far as to say this film rips off other movies, but if you're going to state possible inspirations you may wish to mention Escape from Newyork. Not Lord of the rings. There was totally nothing in common between this film and Lotr. What's wrong with saying this movie was a good one? I think it was pretty unique and gruesome. I get the same intense feeling every time this director does a film. I think he's very original and underrated. Over the decade I've seen so many boring wannabe horror films that just flop. Neil Marshall isn't afraid to test new waters. Hollywood is. I haven't really seen a film with this type of subject matter since Mad Max or Gladiator, even Braveheart. Those films are in a special category of their own so, this one has to be somewhat of a gem. I think it beats out Chronicles of Riddick of similar substance but you, people would probably call it a great film because of the star and all of it's special effects and downplay this one.I await the next Neil Marshall film. Even another Doomsday would be awesome. I'm so glad it was Rhona Mitra.

If The Road Warrior had sex with John Carpenter and they had a retarded child, it would be named Doomsday. Not a single thing in this movie hasn't been done better in some other cult classic that has come before it. Initially, I thought this was going to be an homage to Escape From New York and the Mad Max series, but it turned out to be an insulting travesty instead.I didn't even mind the acting. Rhona Mitra comes off as believable enough, as do the supporting cast for the most part. There are a couple of laughable performances, but there always are in this type of movie. But the action just didn't work for me. Nothing meshed at all. It just sort of chaotically unfolded on the screen, with no real direction.If you want action for action's sake, watch Shoot 'Em Up.

268,Mysticum,Unintentionally Hilarious,1,27 July 2008,"This is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is so fantastically bad, I could talk for hours and hours about each and every little atrociously bad element of the movie. I am no stranger to the incredible or the suspension of disbelief required of any sci-fi fan wishing to be entertained. I love outlandish and outrageous things! I cannot, however, abide things which are literally UN-BELIEVABLE, and which conflict with ANY world, fictional or not.This movie is a tour de force of idiocy. It is one long line of things so unimaginably retarded, you end up with a slight sensation of vertigo from shaking your head so thoroughly from start to finish. I will mention a few things that stood out as being particularly idiotic, but please believe me when I say that there are somewhere in the neighborhood of five hundred to a thousand equally appalling scenes left unmentioned.Let's begin. Why are the soldiers at the beginning standing amidst a crowd of plague-carrying Scots? Why are they in front of the fence? As you ponder this, watching them get torn to shreds, you are interrupted by the realization that not only is there a fence behind which they would have been safe, there is also a forty foot tall steel wall a few hundred feet further back. Why are they not behind this wall? Who is in charge of this completely incompetent band of military morons? Why is a chopper behind enemy lines at this point? Why are the soldiers in the chopper not wearing protective gear? Why do they let indigenous Scots covered in blood and grime approach the helicopter? Why do they bring a blood-covered, bleeding, Scottish girl fresh from the crowd of plague-carrying lunatics onto their chopper, which is en route to the safe side of the wall? Is this not...perhaps a little foolish? In 2035, why does the heroine toss her eyeball (yes, really) instead of using a small mirror? Failing that, why isn't she using a little camera and a wrist-mounted monitor? In 2035? On that note: why is the technology in 2035 virtually indistinguishable from technology in 2008? Returning to our heroine, why would she give up her depth perception and risk losing her one eye? Someone might step on it, I'd think? How does the eye rotate on a flat surface without movable parts, while staying in place? Up in Scotland, if the tanks in which the special forces ride are so sturdy and gas-proof and you'd-need-a-50-caliber-rifle-to-put-a-dent-in-this solid, why does it come equipped with a large glass front window which can be shattered by throwing a brick? Why did no one spot the cows from afar? A thousand cows and suddenly they just hit one in the middle of the herd without warning? Ninja cows? Who dyed the Scots' hair? Why do they dye their hair? Why are they armed and working together? Why are they in the hospital after 27 years? Did they sit there for 27 years thinking, ""One of these days...!"" ? Who took the time to carve the names of disease-victims intricately into the large slab of marble at the hospital? After Scotland is walled in, its population dropping like flies, someone took the time to erect a massive marble wall and start carving the names of the dead into it? Seriously? How could a scientist in 2008 get further with his research in 3 months in a war zone than the entire body of scientists on the planet could in 27 years? Why did the rest of the world's scientists not attempt to concoct a cure for the virus? Why does the guy left behind in the vehicle outside the hospital go out to ""help"" the girl? Why does he carry her into the tank, remove his protective gear, and then turn his back on her? Who exactly is throwing the grenade right after the guy gets his throat slit and dies?I could go on for a great deal longer, I assure you. I repeat: EVERYTHING - every single little thing - about this movie is so indescribably retarded as to be downright depressing.This is the worst movie in the world. Hands down.",Doomsday

Or perhaps nothing much was happening.Mitra stars as a tough drug enforcement cop, abandoned by mum at the start of a deadly epidemic which results in all of Scotland being cut off from the rest of the world, a fact that surprisingly doesn't seem to concern the rest of the UK. (How's that as a metaphor for English/Scottish politics??) She played this role with gusto and there were good supporting roles from a relatively unknown cast. Bob Hoskins played to type, but then there's nothing wrong with that. Overall, however, I came away thinking that so much more could have been made of the story.

I personally think this was just a way of lowering the budget. Worth a watch but only once. i'd much rather watch 28 days later or even i am legend again than sit through this once more.

The mix between cannibalistic freak shows and medieval nights was a bit awkward but I think it worked out for the better. So if you want a movie to watch for some fun, watch this but don't except to much from it.",Doomsday
272,stephen-560-161818,Fun Gore fest but let down by a few things,6,20 October 2009,"The film itself is a largely unoriginal mix of ideas from previous movies, as stated by other commenters. It does however have a number of interesting variations but for the most part, plot line makes way for gore and fun. Basically a deadly virus has wiped out Scotland and the whole country had to be quarantined, then 30 years later the virus strikes again in central London. Satilites have shown there to be people living in Glasgow and it is thought that a scientist who was trapped when the country was quarantined must have successfully found a cure... Cue a team being sent into the quarantined zone to find the cure. Cue Canabalistic Punks, knights on horseback and a general gore fest.This said I found the film generally to be fun and action packed, if at times you had to really shut down your sense of disbelief.However 3 things really got to me.1) How can an Armoured Pernoal Vehicle designed to withstand tank fire etc, be taken out by a few petrol bombs and a punk smashing the windscreen in.2) Where did the train come from... How did the bloke know to be there waiting! Thats ignoring a few other little details such as where did they get a steam train from 3) The pier la resistance... The chase scene at the end. How come the Bently couldn't just leave the pursuers behind for dust. It was just too much to believe. That car has a top speed of about 198mph. The pursuers were on a mixture of 30 year old and unmaintained vehicles (the Benly was basically brand new, having been in airtight packaging. Whats more a dirt bike of that kind could no way do almost 200MPH new, it would have been 250cc at best and even a GP250 bike cannot manage that speed on the track. Put it another way, only the Hyabusa can go that speed as far as I'm aware (bikes wise). And yet a bunch of old dirt bikes and a run down black cab etc not only kept up with, but was outperforming it. This was a step too much for me, and it ruined it.Overall though it was a fun but not great film.",Doomsday
273,glazer_j,Sadistic and Awful,1,21 December 2018,"There is a certain level of violence that I personally have a problem with watching on screen.This movie pushes that level way beyond the limit for 'normal' people.I won't describe it - suffice to say that it is more proper for a dismemberment horror film.It's also incredity stupid, improbably, and the plot is flawed in huge ways.How did a society deveop from chaos and plague? It just happens to look EXACTLY like Mad Max, but way more sick and sadistic?Also, where did they get electricity and fuel and gas? It makes ABSOLUTELY no sense.Add to that a myriad of other factors, and this movie is not only stupid, flawed, and sadistic, but an error in film making technique. i.e. Note to self - what NOT to do when making a film.",Doomsday
274,dftwilight,What film did I watch again??,4,19 March 2008,"OK, so I'm ready to rehash, perhaps pay homage to the people who have commented before me. DOOMSDAY is a mish-mash of much better movies clumped into one big and nutty pile of poop. Being a big fan of the MAD MAX trilogy, when I first saw DOOMSDAY's theatrical trailer and the brief car chase/combat scene, I was intrigued. Could this be an updated, modern telling (homage if you will) to my beloved Max and his apocalyptic world? The answer is NO! It's a rip-off of not only MAD MAX, but ALIENS, 28 DAYS LATER, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, and yes, even EXCALIBER!! I absolutely loved DOG SOLDIERS and THE DESCENT so I thought this would be another Marshall treat. I have a relatively open mind with horror movies. I always expect the worst and when something good shines, it really shines. That's how DOG SOLDIERS was with me at least. But this camp goes all over the place visually and the cinematic styles are so different that it feels like a hodge podge of directors shooting various scenes for one film.Can anyone tell me what the hell was going on in that Scottish castle?? All I saw was dust popping up and suddenly Kane's fortress is being attacked. Attacked by what?? Catapults? Large sacks of sand?? It was established that Sol was at war with Kane, but when our heroes escape, Sol and his buddies seem to give up the assault (am I right to assume it was Sol who attacked Kane??) and chase them down abandoned Scottish highways. Was Kane even necessary or was it just some way to get Malcom McDowell another B-movie side role?? There's only so much of his alcohol-ridden bulbous nose I can see on screen before my eyes finally fall out from rolling all over the place.The only reason I'm giving DOOMSDAY a rating of 4 is because of the outstanding gory shots we get to see (i.e. the officer at the beginning getting his head blown off with a shotgun, people getting run over into bloody pulps, etc...) and the lovely Rhona Mitra (who in the IMDb credits list is almost last...you'd think the main protagonist would be in the top 3 at least...).Anyhoo, if you like good acting, character development, and would love to have your disbelief suspended, this is not the movie for you. If you don't care about any of that stuff, go see DOOMSDAY and enjoy it for its violence.",Doomsday
275,willowmagic3,Doomsday - Your Not-So-Average Action Flick,8,3 May 2008,"Doomsday It's a virus, the virus has taken over the surrounding population, and the world has gone into mass chaos. Sound familiar? As I noted in my I Am Legend review, the past years has brought more end of the world films than fingers on your hands. But this movie is not one of those.A virus has broken out in Britain. No, it does not turn those infected into a zombie/undead villain, but rather resembles a hybrid black death that eats at our bodies. A wall-enclosed civilization has been created to keep the uninfected contained and the infected outside to die a painful death in hopes of starting over once again. 30 or so years pass and it is suspected the infected outside have died off, but when survivors are spotted on satellites they send out a special team to investigate and bring back a cure.There have been many human versus the undead movies lately. From the commercials of doomsday you can't really tell much about the movie. One thing is for sure though, this is NOT a zombie movie. Thank god! This film is an intense and extremely violent thrill fest. The whole premise of this film I believe was to have non-stop action the whole way through, and it basically did.With the years in our new horror era has brought an array of heroines including Milla Jovovich and Kate Beckinsale. Well welcome Rhona Mitra, our new not-so-typical heroine! She plays the leader in the team sent to find the cure. One thing to say about her is that she is pure bad-ass and isn't a site for sore eyes either. Among smaller parts by unknowns in this film, Bob Hoskins lays a hand in this film as her ""boss"" and Malcolm McDowell (Dr. Samuel Loomis from the Halloween remake) takes a small role as a surviving civilization leader outside the city walls. Not too much acting was needed for this film, it still delivered well despite the lack of dialogue in most parts.Compared to director Neil Marshall's previous smash hit The Descent, Doomsday is a strong followup. Neil Marshall sure knows how to deliver a face-paced horror without the unnecessary kinks.My verdict: The film is now out of theaters, so when it comes onto DVD (and I hope to god Blu-Ray!) I'd totally suggest you rent it, turn off the lights, and jack up the volume!",Doomsday
276,mrsmiley-03590,Started out so well but the last half was incredibly bad,4,19 July 2017,"I might be a late comer for this film and Doomsday was released in 2008. It was directed by Neil Marshall who's work include The Descent, Dog Soldiers and some TV episodes. I've seen Dog Soldiers before this and loved it, so I was actually interested at Doomsday, as Neil Marshall seems to love 80's movies a lot. Dog Soldiers was pretty much a homage to 80's horror films and Doomsday obviously takes influence from Mad Max but also seems to add some elements from 28 Days Later (great film).Doomsday doesn't seem to be known by most people and was a box office disappointment and after seeing Doomsday, I wasn't surprised why it failed.Doomsday starts out great as we see that there is a dangerous disease called, Reaper virus, which kills most of the infected. UK government isolates Scotland by building a large wall near Hadrian's wall (I think). This causes diplomatic problems with the rest of the world among other issues like civil unrest and unemployment. After 25 years (or 27 or 30, I don't know. The information is conflicted), Reaper virus is found on London. Quarantines take place and most likely isn't going to hold long, so other measures should be taken. It it revealed that Scotland has survivors, meaning that there should be a cure and government sends a small group to find it.By now it's clear that Doomsday isn't very logical film and it's suppose to be like old B-movies. It doesn't make sense most of the time, but doesn't take itself too seriously. To put it simply, stupid fun. I would argue that it works for the first half, but the moment action starts behind the walls, Doomsday becomes a mess. Too many illogical situations come and go, along with the action. This wouldn't necessary be a bad thing for this kind of film, but there's so many fast cuts and poorly paced music, it becomes annoying. It's sad because I actually found the previous moments very interesting and even creepy. There were high stakes finding the cure and we do see some moments of total chaos in London (unlike in misleading trailer, it didn't have the time to spread to whole region).There are so many questions left after seeing the film. I know it's suppose to be silly on purpose but it's not silly in a good way. For example: 1. How did Reaper Virus got into London sewers without infecting people that are near Scotland. I assumed it was smugglers, but why would they go to Scotland and wasn't it the most heavily guarded places on earth? If it was the government sector that did it, wouldn't it make sense to send a squad to get the cure before releasing Reaper virus to London? 2. How did cannibals come up a good plan against two armored vehicles? Did they have scouts all over the place? They just suddenly come out of nowhere like they are ghosts or something. Also, why was it a good idea to bring that one woman inside the vehicle when it was SO OBVIOUS that she was a bait. 3. How did cannibals and medieval-like knights (seriously) find the good guys so easily? It happens three times and they somehow organized everything.4. What were good guys trying to do after finding out that former doctor (played by Malcolm McDowell) has gone crazy. I understand why the lead female intentionally got caught, but what were they trying to do before getting caught? Did they try to approach the castle or something else? There are other problems, but I don't have enough time and space to mention all of them.I can live with the wall building speed and unrealistic tribes with great amount of fuel and resources even after 25 years, but adding too much silly moments while trying to keep a serious tone can break the film. I just don't think that same magic can be added to modern movies unlike in 70's and 80's. Dog Soldiers is an exception, but somehow Marshall, with his team, failed to capture the 80's in Doomsday. There are definitely good moments in Doomsday, which is why I give Doomsday a 4/10, like the first half of the film, special effects were top notch (hard to tell difference between practical effects and CGI) and action wasn't bad until the final action sequence (which did have one shot that was awesome). Casting was surprisingly good even if dialogue was slightly cringe-worthy. Actors did fine job with the material they were given; Bob Hoskins' character being my favorite. The moments when we see Reaper virus affecting people were honestly creepy and I wished the film would've shown more. Doomsday does forget what it's suppose to be and tries too hard to be 80's film.I wouldn't give a 4/10 and instead give it a perhaps 7/10 or 8/10 if the film keep the tone and atmosphere of the first half. Too long action setup without breaks with continuous action music playing in the background and fast editing just hurt my ears and eyes. Just because you make quick edits and add music to a scene, it doesn't make a good action film. The last half was really that bad.",Doomsday
277,stoneage22,Rhona Mitra's got me hooked,10,28 March 2008,"I admit, I was blindsided. The coming attractions to this movie tell you all you need to know about the plot. Once again, a highly athletic lead has to enter the city overrun by zombies/diseased psychotics/ cannibals and get the cure. The set-up is gradual enough to draw us in, yet keep our interest. The ""safer"" outside world includes Sidig el Fadil, who was quite good in 'Syriana' and veteran actor Bob Hoskins. I suspected it was going to take itself too seriously and be awful or just plain boring. Even if 'Doomsday' exceeded all expectations, it had little chance of topping 'I Am Legend'. It did neither. It just served up a fun, intense, action-filled blood fest, that even Robert Rodriquez would be proud of. Once I finally realized where the movie was going, I loved it! It's a plunge into wildness with babes who can take non-stop punishment and cars that should have run out of gas years ago. Several of the schemes are quite clever and the villains are over the top but not to the point of idiocy. Sure, the stoic, unemotional lead is overdone, but this time I didn't mind. The film is not trying to get noticed for it's artistic achievement. I'd love to see great acting. However, if we stop allowing the actor to ""keep it all on the inside"", or ""keep a stiff upper lip"" to cover a lack of acting talent, we'd never have Guy Pierce or Keanu Reeves! I just assume Rhona Mitra's British. And while Rhona doesn't have anywhere close to Kate Winslet's acting ability, (or her curves) she has more meat on her than Beckinsale and Keira Knightley put together! So, if you want a fun ride with screaming maniacs, resourceful heroines and indestructible cars, SEE 'DOOMSDAY' NOW! Let the eyes pop out and the brain matter flow!!",Doomsday
278,donald2-1,3rd class stunt show in some scruffy abandoned theme park,1,22 June 2008,"Well, I more than respected the director for The Descent and promoted his film to everybody I could get a hold of but this poor excuse of a tongue-in-cheek pseudo-homage to the 80's is unforgivably rotten. It looks like the director left the set, the crew and the equipment to those stunt circus people who make their living in a cheesy entertainment park in hicksville.It is so wrong in all possible ways, that one has to see it to believe it. No wonder, that Malcolm McDowell pops up once in a while - he should have shot his brains out a long time ago, but decided to stay for his own disgrace. Actually, I was only waiting for Rutger Hauer to appear...And what's with the over-the-top violence? What else is new? Haven't we seen crap like this a gazillion times before? Exploding bunnies give you so much more...if you are a mentally retarded 12-year-old, who obviously has written the script to this schnarchfest while he was wanking off...It would only be fair if Neil Marshall would now have to direct ""I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!"" for the rest of his life...",Doomsday

As most have said, there are several movies within one here from ""28 Weeks Later to Aliens to Lord of the Rings to RoadWarror'. The star of the movie Rhona Mitra plays it straight as tough as nails warrior who leads the charge from segment to segment. I have never seen a woman take so much pain and only have few scratches.

282,dimitriteixeira-1,"Different, but works.",7,3 January 2009,"Doomsday was rather interesting. It was different, unique and overall fun. I believe that Rhona Mitra was perfect for the lead roll. There's just something about her stylized violent moves that make it a sexy-action thriller. To begin with, the story was actually phenomenal and the acting was above proficient. From the scenes of gore and disturbing nature, which I do warn if truly not for children 10 and under, to the end of the film with an action car race, head to head battle for life and salvation.Very good movie, not what I expected. It actually does not feel like its actual runtime, it feels rather short.",Doomsday
283,diseriq,ridiculously retarded B movie that is fun fun fun!,8,15 March 2008,"OK, like before DOOMSDAY, Neil Marshall made two great films, DOG SOILDERS and THE DESCENT, so going into this, i had high expectations. then i heard all of the negative buzz on the internet for months and months. so then i had low expectations. and the trailer sucked. basically, if you go into this film expecting anything serious at all, then yeah, you're going to be disappointed, because this is in no way a serious movie sci-fi action future apocalypse thriller. what it is - a tongue in cheek splatter fest homage to the great John Carpenter movies of the 80s and with a bunch of mad max thrown in. if you loved PLANET TERROR, then you will dig on this. really this flick reminded me of the vibe of BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA or CRANK. i'm not sure why more people weren't laughing, cause this film is simply hilarious. it just gets more and more over the top! cannibalistic punks BBQ one of our heroes to Siouxsie and the Banshees ""Spellbound."" and they have a GIMP!! little furry bunnies get blown up, and cows are squashed via tanks! oh yeah, look at you now, all covered in virus infected blood prime minister. what did you say, who is that guy? oh yeah! it's Dr Bashir from Star Trek Deep Space Nine, yes!!! the gore is consistently excessive and top notch. then out of nowhere, it's a knight on a horse, hey there's Malcom McDowell collecting a paycheck!! boy does his nose crazy silly for some reason! this film is totally intentionally funny and camp. the thing is, i think it has a bit too much of a British sensibility for an American audience, cause there is a certain dryness to the humor, but it's pretty clear that Neil Marshall set out to make a big dumb retarded and fun Hollywood movie, and that ironically Hollywood is too stupid to know how to market it. this will find an audience on video, cause while parts of it are derivative of it's influences, it's too much fun not to like. you just gotta keep drinking and/or smoking! there are only a couple of aspects that keep it from being great - the editing is terrible pretty much throughout, and some of the action is hard to follow. then there is the dialogue that is really poorly staged. like they were working so fast to get the shots and come in under budget (especially at what is supposed to be a climatic scene between our heroine and one of the villains) that they just staged it, shot it once, and the actors were like, hurry up lets be done with this, we're ready to hit up that catered food. but regardless, i had a blast, don't know why my roommate asked the theater management for his money back, what a loser.",Doomsday
284,Belgand-4,"Gratuitous, derivative, and a thorough waste of time",3,14 March 2008,"I was very impressed by both of Marshall's previous films. Dog Soldiers was a very good addition to the often poorly served werewolf sub-genre and The Descent had some really good and realistic ideas for a horror film... until the cave monsters showed up and it went a bit further than necessary. Still, both were reasonably intelligent modern horror films that showed him to be a talent to watch.I saw this as a free screening due largely Marshall's other films. After seeing it, however, I really wish I had passed.It's little more than a mish-mash of much better films with little in the way of plot or character to fill in the moments between set-pieces and gratuitous moments: e.g. random topless girl, something blows up for no reason, something explodes in a cloud of blood... these occur left and right and entirely without reason or purpose. It blatantly rips off the plot from Escape from New York (a character is even named Carpenter in apparent homage), the set-up will be compared to 28 Days Later (though any ""massive viral outbreak in Britain"" plot will get that now), steals a lot of design and atmosphere from Mad Max and still manages to throw in some medieval nonsense in there as well.Fight scenes were of the terrible, overly-fast, shaky-cam, quick-cut style making them a jumbled mess and none of the effects really felt that impressive. Almost none of the plot has any semblance of sense with almost every action occurring for little to no reason and characters being encountered so randomly that the writing doesn't feel quite good enough to even be considered lazy.In all I really enjoyed most of the films this is derived from. Heck, I even enjoyed Escape from LA to a moderate degree. This, however, was a waste of time and money even as a free screening.",Doomsday
285,jason-1649,Who run Barter Town???,8,23 March 2008,"OK, anyone who has seen the previews knows what this movie is about. Truth be told the plot doesn't go much deeper than what you've seen in the previews, that does not mean this is a lousy movie, quite the contrary. However, if your wondering if you should see this ask yourself which of the two following phrases best describes you: 1) ""I am a self righteous, pretentious ass who only enjoys movies if they are artsy and about subjects that couldn't hold the attention of a lobotomized autistic geriatric. I pretend that I understand complicated plots, even if the plot doesn't make sense to anyone and only seems complicated because writer uses big words to make things seem intelligent. I will in turn write a review showing my intelligence by basically copying what a big name critic, who is too full of himself to actually enjoy a movie, said and using my thesaurus to hide the fact I really have no talent or creativity. I mean because I have great talent and creativity, because I am an art major which makes me superior to all those science majors and their so called ""jobs"" they will get upon graduating."" 2)""I like a good action movie from time to time. You know like back in the days of Chuck Norris, Steven Segall, Van Damme, and Mel Gibson before the psychotic anti-semitism. Back when a plot wasn't strong, but it was still enjoyable to watch a couple of people lay waste to everyone in their path of righteous destruction. Back when one person could smash through everything and in the end not have a scratch on their face, their guns had infinite ammo, and their car still runs despite the fact it should have been destroyed by now. Perhaps even just seeing people beat the crap out of each other, like remember that Bruce Lee movie where Kareem Abdul-Jabbar kicked him in the chest and left that foot print, that was bad-ass!"" If you answered 2 you might enjoy this movie. If you answered 1, go choke on something, and if your up to it, DIE!!! This movie feels like an old action movie brought up to date, a lot of violence, a lot of blood, and even a gratuitous boob shot near the beginning. The people do run out of ammo, but there is still the impossible indestructible car chase scene from days of old.If you do like solid plot or storyline, this isn't for you, as there are a lot of issues. For instance, one scene uses a underground military facility sort of thing guarded by ""12 inch thick blast doors."" Problem is though it can be accessed easily by any two rusty old gates on either side of a mountain. If you think the doors are guarding something your wrong, they just lead to the road. I guess during an attack people will only hit facilities in Britain if accessible by road because, I guess, invading countries are too lazy to go around to the back door... And let's not forget bullet proof APCs that can have their windows smashed in with a baseball bat.Also there's this issue where the movie doesn't seem to know where it wants to be, in a Mad Max knock-off or some strange life back to a cast system due to collapse of society thing. There is actually a scene involving castles and knights on horses with armor, don't get me wrong I got the idea, but that's a hell of a concept mixed in with the Mad Max genre isn't it? Oh and when I say ""like Mad Max,"" I mean exactly like Mad Max. There is a car chase scene in the movie where a mohawked, leather clad, post apocalyptic punk gang chases the protagonists in cars like those out of Mad Max. Let me point out here these cars not only look like vehicles from Mad Max, I could honestly believe they were used in Mad Max. It's like the designer plugged in the Road Warrior and Beyond Thunder Dome and said, ""If I change this I could.... Screw this we'll just copy those."" I honestly felt disappointed the main actress didn't fight a giant retard with a midget on his back.Not original, but not bad. Yeah the plot stinks, but there's lots of good ole wholesome face smashing action and a lack of realism that brings back such fond memories of a time when toy guns could rob banks and dodging Jarts was a pastime enjoyed by children who openly practiced Darwinism...",Doomsday
286,Cobra_Unit,An OK B-movie,6,9 April 2008,"This film from Neil Marshall (""The Descent"", ""Dog Soldiers"") is a guilty pleasure, a silly but highly enjoyable ride that takes no prisoners.Major Sinclair (the surprisingly good Rhona Mitra) is sent on a mission to find a vaccine to a deadly virus spreading across London. The antidote is expected to be somewhere into the Containment Zone (aka former Scotland) where, unbeknown to the opinion, the immune victims of the first outbreak survive in a savage state, ruled by opposite barbarians factions.And, of course, the mission goes terribly wrong.This flick may be a guilty pleasure, but one I'm not ashamed to give an above-average rating, as it displays many upsides: the low budget rarely shows, the film is perfectly paced, most actors are good (while this kind of films rarely gathers respected Thespians, the cast is homogeneous and strong) and the ending is quite pleasant, in its own twisted way.Of course there are some plot holes, and suspension of disbelief is requested to enjoy it.

The story is awful and mildly said stupid, full of inconsistencies and errors. It is grossly over produced. Looks like some money laundering on epic scale. Acting is sad, the stars in the film are marked in my book as a money hungry media prostitutes. It looks like some bad music video director (with a lot of family money and connections) tried really hard to make a stupid film. From its budget there could have been made 10 good films. It was so terrible, I had to write this review. Why? Why would anyone give money for this peace of ****? My heart goes to the film workers who had to endure this awfulness day in day out. I worked once on a film that was maybe not so bad, but really close, and it was the hardest money I've ever earned. Please don't make movies like this.

288,johnnycandle,Scripted by the Son Of Rambow kids?,3,12 August 2008,"There's theory that a great actor can utter the most ridiculous lines and make them sound real and plausible. That being the case, either Bob Hoskins and Malcom MacDowell's powers have deserted them or, that this film hits previously unknown lows in dialogue. Hoskins and MacDowell just look embarrassed. And so they should be.This movie is basically 28 Weeks Later meets Mad Max with medieval bits thrown in. Everyone speaks in clichés (absolutely all the time) and everything explodes. If you like the sound of that, knock yourself out.It's difficult to describe what a confusing experience watching this movie is. Despite all the death and destruction and relentless pace, it somehow manages to be dull.I shall attempt to explain why. Imagine a competition, like the UK's old Screen Test. This is like some kids have been given access to a (adimitedly excellent) technical crew, actors and some unconnected sets and props and told they could make their own movie using any of them. Being kids they choose them all. They then immediately got on with filming, writing in recycled one liners from Dolph Lungdren movies as they went along.I am well aware that films like this are not intended to be taken seriously, however, that does not mean that the story and dialogue should be irrelevant.As I've moaned about every film I've reviewed thus far I shall try to find some positives. Rhona Mitra is good, the stunts are refreshingly low on CGI and the camera and colours are nice. In fact it's all very nicely made and looks as good as the films it ""pays homage"" too. And, should you like gory scenes, Doomsday provides you plenty to cheer, but nothing you haven't seen before.I feel I should mention the nudity. I like sexy movies as much, and probably a lot more than your next man. But the sexless nudity in films like this is so clearly only there so they get ""contains nudity"" to go with ""contains strong bloody violence"" on the DVD box. It therefore ticks all the boxes for teenage boys that this film is clearly aimed at. Cynical but doubtless effective stuff.So if you are an undemanding teenage boy this may be a good mates and pizza movie, if you are anything else, run a bloody mile.",Doomsday

Plenty of blood and macabre be-headings explosions and dismemberment. I however refuse to believe that when society as we know it comes to an end we will dress in 80s punk or chain mail. Apparently everyone with a brain killed themselves in the early stages of this dystopian decline. You may be thinking hey gore, punks. Why not? Don't make the mistake I did.",Doomsday
290,carolinefangel-2,Nostalgic slideshow or a movie?,3,3 July 2008,"The effects are OK. Thats the only good thing to say really. So far all the good ratings here have been based on the happy nostalgic feeling of seeing a reference to an old movie they liked. Mad Max, Aliens (some say), LotR. But a movie is a movie, not a just random references put together. And this movie sux. The movie wants everything and delivers nothing. We get a deadly virus, but what is it? What does it do? How did it travel to england on its own in 30 years? Only answer is that overpopulating forces a natural selection. So if too many people in one place the virus just pops up? We get that strange steampunkish society, but how does that work? They're served 1 live soldier to eat, and there's around 100 people there. Not nearly enough food for them. And whats with the rockshow before that? If they've been shut away for almost 30 years, where do they get supplies from? Food? Drinks? Beer? Gazoline? they MUST have enough gazoline, since they waste it, doing that stupid bike-show just before cooking the soldier. Run run run, now we're in Sherwood with Robinhood. Now he's dead, and now we're in a medieval castle somewhere, were everyone apparently knows how to make a perfect leather armor. When we enter the castle, it seems the guards like to hang people on the walls and shoot them with arrows! Whats with that? And why did they even resort to old medieval lifestyle anyway? How did they learn about swordfighting, armormaking, clothmaking, spearfighting etc.? And the evil kings daughter: born 10 years after virus incident, but has never seen a car? The streets in the city is full of them!This was just a tiny portion of all the things that went wrong with this movie. The ending is just horrible. What, Canaris(or whats his name) gets exposed as corrupt? Or not? And does that save the 12 million English people? Does Eden (a name that obviously carries some symbolic significance, and they just ignore it?) become the king of the cannibals, or are they just happy to get some more food? And why would she become king? To protect herself for when Canaris will be coming for her, to kill the medieval king or to tear down the wall?All in all this movie raises more questions than it answers. It was horrible, and i'm sorry to have spend money on it.",Doomsday
291,civo69,Mix it all together and divide it by 2,4,27 July 2010,"If you think of Mad Max,I am Legend,Resident Evil, spice it a little with Gladiator and divided by 2, you will get this movie. Since to all the previous I would give an 8, this is a 4.The best thing in the movie is really Rhona Mitra, who appears very leather stylish, with beautiful close ups. Photography also does a decent job with Scotland's landscapes... Other than that, just plain visual violence, with heads exploding (arms, legs, whatever!), people eating each other... I think just Rhona itself killed like 500 people!Interesting the idea of people returning to medieval age, due to lack of values, but not developed enough to stick.The worst, the car pursuit, in which Rhona is driving a Bentley GT Continental Diamond (551 bhp)and is caught up by the rebels driving junkyard cars and bikes...

Minimal CGI use, lots of real physical special effects (blood, explosions, stunts). George Lucas could learn a thing or two (CGI should support, but not ""be"" the movie.. at least not yet). Craig Conway does a marvelous job as the savage ""Sol"". Bob Hoskins commands authenticity. Rhona Mitra and the rest of the assault team are fabulous. A few minutes could be shaved off the movie to keep the flow going better at a couple spots, but everything else is great.

294,spockmonkey4,a decent action flick!,8,12 May 2008,"I went to the cinema expecting to be disappointed as usual but I was actually pleasantly surprised by this film. Not being a Hollywood 'A-Lister' as it were, the film didn't make too big a deal of it's stars, nor did it over-glorify the special effects. With a fairly tongue-in-cheek script, plenty of gore to please the horror fans right from the outset and some well choreographed fight scenes, not to mention decent effects and some actors who were all too happy to bring some good old British swearing into the mix, this was a film that left me with a big smile on my face as I exited said cinema. It's not the best movie ever made and it sure rips off plenty of other post-apocalyptic films but all in all I have to say I enjoyed the ride immensely; and isn't that the point when all's said and done?

Watch where the director places his camera. Listen to how the music works in tune with the pictures. Look in awe as you are entertained by David, not a $250 million Goliath.Using his budget constraints brilliantly, the director and crew have done a fantastic job of making this world believable. And at a fraction of the price of I Am Legend (which I heard being advertised on DVD as an action epic!) If, like me you grew up in the eighties and the films you were reared on were Escape From New York, Mad Max and Aliens, you have to see this love note all of those (right down to the font on the credits being similar to a lot of early John Carpenter films).In short, I loved this film, a solid, entertaining and often damn funny mix of action and horror.

I briefly wonder why I didn't put 10/10 and then I remember why: The first half of the movie is outstandingly excellent, the second half turns to cheese. Suddenly, in the second half, interesting fiction turns into poorly though and ridiculous nonsense fiction. For example, old worn out vehicles go as fast as a million dollar vehicles. I guess if 1 was faster, there would be no action!The movie is totally worth watching if you are part of the young adult male audience that loves apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction.

299,jpjmoffett,It's Not So Bad,5,10 July 2013,"Description: A future Europe is set upon by a virus, a gang, and rapid-cut editing. Escape From New York meets Mad Max, minus character development or anything new.The Good: Gore - Not the prolonged type, sad to say, but there are several wonderful moments of heavy splatter and nastiness. These are invariably edited before the audience can sink in their collective teeth but it is there and in fine style, including several innovative and action packed deaths.Action - Truth be told, I actually nodded off (literally) during the second act but the first and third acts were frenetic and made up for it. When someone dies it's usually cool looking and there were plenty of explosions and crazy weapons stuff to occupy my eyes.Acting - As an actor myself, I am reticent to besmirch the work of another Thespian so I'll stick to what I liked. For all of the bad, cliché or questionable performances to be found in this film, the work of Craig Conway more than makes up for all it. He masterfully portrays Sol, the chaotic punk warlord with the bleached-out Pawnee hair-style and the big red bio-hazard back tattoo. The energy and fanaticism he permeates this role with are astounding and well worth the watch. His and Leeanne Leibenberg's performances totally made this film for me.Also, Leeanne Leibenberg is way beyond hot, so there's that. Seriously though, it is a shame she wasn't afforded a greater opportunity to a larger role in this film. As Sol's girlfriend, that character could have had a considerably greater impact on the story and saved the viewer a boring second act.The Bad: In a word: realism. Sure, it's a futuristic sci-fi film so how realistic can it be, right? Wrong.While the film is set in the future, the story makes a big deal out of how primitive the situation is north of Hadrian's Wall. The problem with this is the avalanche of silliness that ensues when the evil anarchists throw a party complete with massive spot lights, a live band, huge speakers, and massive bonfires surrounded by half a million young, beautiful punk kids who apparently have an inexhaustible supply of nail polish and Manic Panic hair dye. One can only assume that the Reaper Virus only took out the ugly people. It was as if the inhabitants of The Matrix's' Zion all suddenly decided to become punks instead of ravers. Also, the film makes a big to-do about how the quarantined people had to resort to cannibalism (and even demonstrates that they still do) but then we are shown how there are like a billion trillion cows roaming the country side. All of this still excludes the other major plot hole concerning everyone being surprised that there are people still alive in the quarantined zone - a fact that would be a bit hard to miss once the all-night slam/rave kicked in.There's also a bit where the unarmed 110lb heroin takes out a three hundred pound, armor-clad man who is bristling with weapons in a gladiatorial one-on-one. She does this without breaking a sweat, mussing her hair, or smearing her makeup. Granted, it is just one small scene but the goofiness of it burns in my memory still and there are several scenes like this throughout.All of this, however, is simply a product of dumbed-down writing. Undoubtedly, the makers of this film were after a Mad Max/28 Days Later style action adventure that they didn't want to bog down by making people think too much. They succeeded.However, it could be argued that swashbuckler films must be campy and cliché in order to maintain the concept and the same could be said here. If you're looking for believable sci-fi action, look elsewhere.The Ugly: Lots of rapid-cut editing, poor character development, rampant cliché character types and nonsensical plot with more holes than a chain mail shower curtain. Many of the performances leave something to be desired as well.Old School: Lovers of old-school slasher/horror will probably dig the blasting brains and ultra-gore. The graphic effects are fantastic and enjoyable but the amount of screen time given them is brief. Except of course for the severed woman head. You'll see what I mean.New Blood: younger audiences will probably enjoy the super-fast editing here that keeps the action scenes whipping along at rock-video speed. Bring a pillow for the second act though.To See or Not to See? Rent, buy, pirate or Con? I liked this film and definitely recommend it to horror and sci-fi fans alike, but before you rent, buy or download, you may want to con someone else into getting it first: they rent Doomsday, you buy the beer and everyone will be happy. It's a fun film - give it a go.",Doomsday
300,thekeeperscages,One of the best,10,15 March 2008,"This is one the best movies i've seen in a long time. This movie had everything in it. From both extremes of the spectrum. Sol played by Craig Conway added so much life to this movie, his enthusiasm in his character was off the charts, I don't think anybody could have done a better job. As for the lead actress Rhona Mitra, she did an outstanding job, her performance was incredible. The only thing I wish this movie had more of was Lee-Anne Liebenburg who played Viper, (the crazy looking girl with the tattoos on her face and is in all the trailers) but from what I saw in the way of Viper, she gave a superb performance. DoomsDay had all the right elements to a killer movie, everything about it was done in such a way that it will make your adrenaline pump throughout the entire movie.

It is one of the true mysteries in life, that the director Neil Marshall who made a great movie like ""The Descent"" could have masterminded this pile of excrement. While watching this tortuous exercise in film-making, my mind started to wander to those "" Orange mobile phone adverts"" where famous actors pitch there scripts to an assortment of idiots from Orange, the only problem with "" Doomsday"" is that it felt as if similar idiots with more money than sense must have loved the thought of this project, and gave the green light. Where do you start! The most banal dialogue you could ever imagine,my nine-year-old would be embarrassed to write such Tosh. Acting straight out of Sherwood Forest, I swear the lead actress had acorns hanging down from her ears she was that bad!How an earth did Bob Hoskins ever allow himself to be persuaded to appear in this disaster, surely a potential "" Doomsday"" for his career. Shameless plagiarism of ideas from films (and please!, don't talk about homage to other movies such as Mad Max and 28 days as other reviewers have mentioned, as there would be grounds for prosecution for using the word ""homage"" under the trade descriptions act. I have been watching films for over 40 years, and I have definitely seen worse films than Doomsday, however this must surely rank within the top 20. I would strongly suggest that before you even remotely begin to think about spending your hard earned cash watching this abysmal excuse for a movie, visit your local DIY shop, purchase a large tin of paint, and proceed to paint a large wall and then spend the time it would take to sit through Doomsday, watching it dry!

I loved most of the movies this movie reminded me of but somehow they messed this film up. They stole from good films but didn't do this one properly. I had big expectations because this director has done two good movies in the past but i guess he let the bigger budget and fame get to his head and just got lazy. There are tons of plot holes, the story is a rip off of other stories and the characters aren't very likable. One thing i did like were that there was some good gore in this movie, I'm a big fan of gore. No weird movie is complete without Malcolm McDowell being in it, that was another plus.

Borrowing from all of these movies in an attempt to make a cohesive whole was not entirely successful, but the car chase near the end of the film was worth the price of admission, as well as the shifting of locales from modern London to a medieval-esquire Scotland community governed by Malcolm McDowell. True, ""Doomsday"" was gratuitously violent and bloody but not boring.

307,ebyandsmartie,A Fanboy too far.....,3,21 March 2008,"As a child of the video age, I grew up watching Mad Max 2, Escape From New York and Aliens. I looked for the films with cool covers and great sounding titles and ran home to find some fantastic titles. But I also found other amazing looking video covers, films that promised more of the action seen in the above classics. They also seemed to have been 'influenced', a great deal, by these film makers and all had Italian directors! The 1970's to the early 1990's saw a great deal of 'influenced' remakes, copies, unofficial sequels to some of the now great Sci-Fi films. The Italians ran wild with the whole post-apocalyptic, zombie, bleak future genre. My friends and I even made our own short 8mm movies that were 'influenced' by John Carpenter, George Miller, James Cameron, George A. Romero etc.. but were we kids, fanboys, didn't know better, just wondering what it would be like to make the perfect Sci-FI movie.So I'm sure Neil Marshall was also a child like me who also had a dream of one day creating the ultimate movie, with all the best bits we loved. But all we get to sit through is a 100mins of just complete rip offs of these amazing titles. Now I'm a fan of Neil Marshall's films and he is great to listen too, but he needs to hang his head in shame. You could, in a day, make this movie by editing all the bits he's taken from other movies. The prologue and graphics from the start of Escape From NY, the failed entry of the troops and their vehicles from Aliens, the capture of the hero (twice) who escapes, fights and kills their best warrior, which again is from Escape From NY, it just goes on and on like this. But how do you get Mad Max 2 into the picture, well how cares what works, even if its just stupid, just put it in any way! So we get a big car chase/battle that is so like Mad Max 2 George Miller could real have grounds ask for royalties. And the finally, well it just keeps on taking!I know that if I had been given a ton of money when I was 15, I would have made the same stupid mistakes, thinking, hay I love these movies and so do my friends, so they'll love it if I do it again and do all the best bits, but were not kids and we can see what you have done Mr Marshall, your 'influenced' movie is nothing but a lazy attempt to recreate these terrific movies. At best you may push some teenagers to go watch the originals, but you have done so much harm you have gained nothing. And just for the record, if a car just hits metal it doesn't mean it has to blow up or if a large van hits a motorcycle it will fly into the air and explode like it just ran into a bomb!What gets me is that next year they were/are planning to remake Escape from New York, too late. Lets hope this film has done one thing good and puts an end to it, that and it has no star and no director.This gets 3 stars for replacing Donald Pleasence with the brilliant Malcolm McDowell and Tom Atkins with Bob Hoskins.",Doomsday

You also find out during the movie that people in Scotland were 'eating' each other yet when the convoy comes through the gate they find thousands of cows, I bet you get the idea.Me and some friends also noticed the fact that it somehow turns into different movies through out, legolas appears with his bow and arrow and it all of a sudden turns into lord of the rings, do the signature theme tune and you'll notice it, I promise :) Other incredibly dumb things include cars made out of bones catching up with a bentley and a random black guy who seems to be not only retarded but some sort of slave appearing every now and then to make you laugh your balls off.If you want one of those movies that make you laugh at how incredibly random and mind numbing, watch it.",Doomsday

In Doomsday they also use shifty cam. That is they shift to a new scene very fast, and makes it even more difficult to see the details and enjoy the action.

People have referenced the warriors, Mad Max, 28 days later and many more to describe this film but the truth is that its nothing like these films.There is no room for story, continuity, good acting or apparently physics in this film. I felt drained as I left the Cinema. This is what happens when movie buffs start making movies, they don't write anything new the just compile all their knowledge of film quotes and trivia into one two hour long farce. Homage isn't the word, I'd use insult.The film begins with some desperately violent Cordoning off of Scotland and begins the spiral off into a world of bad acting, Nonsensical plot lines and medieval knights! The plot, if you can find it amongst this tip of conspicuous homage's poorly conceived (even forced) ideas, is more full of holes than the Tsars. The actors? It seems that Neil Marshall hired everyone of his friends that couldn't get work (and some that could to play small bit parts and cameos). The ending was so bad it made me feel like I'd been punched in the groin!Dogs Soldiers was great, the Descent was good but Doomsday is worse than the Plague its ""story"" centres around. I really hope that everyone just forgets this movie and it disappears, even Neil Marshall himself because if he makes more movies like this he is in real danger of becoming the British Uwe Boll. . .

It just falls so flat on its face, its sad. Simply put, if you like seeing a man get burned alive and then cut up and eaten, then you will enjoy this. Moreover, if that is what you like you also need to seek psychological help. This film, like many others coming out, seems to use graphic violence to the extreme, to the point where it gives you a headache to watch such gore.Watching a child get her eye shot out and people burned alive and heads chopped off is not necessary to make an effective film that portrays the violence of a barbaric society. Maybe we are the barbaric society, for making such films. The film also tries too hard to use too many themes.It could have been a Lord of the Flies v's Mad Max and yet I just feel let down by it all.For those looking for a reason for our violent society, look no further.It's again stressed a need for me to stay away from 18 rated films (there just too much, of 'anything bad' in them).",Doomsday
320,phil-1384,Oh dear God....,1,28 July 2008,"I sat down last night to watch this, during my ""Man Time"", which I look forward to. Never have I been so disappointed. OK....maybe not never - I have seen some movies that I have stopped before they finished - but only a couple, and they were REALLY bad.I am a fan of sci-fi, action and all that sort of stuff, and love getting the adrenalin flowing by watching a good action scene, but my pulse can't have reached more than about 30 during the entire course of the film.I ended up channel-hopping to normal TV during the last hour, and when I found nothing else on, I watched the last 45 minutes of the film in double speed, as I didn't want to just turn it off, in case it got better, but wanted to waste as little of my life on it as possible, in case it didn't.It tried to be lots of things, but failed in all of them. If it was trying to be rubbish, however, it succeeded.Should have known it would be bad when I saw all the reject actors in there (ex Eastenders and soap stars...that sort of thing).Waste of my man-time!",Doomsday

The central chase with a 48 hour deadline was very vague.On the plus side, Rhona Mitra is a great lead; vicious and gorgeous in equal measure.Bob Hoskins is, well, Bob Hoskins but the failure to build up Malcolm McDowell as a Kurt/ Cyrus figure is disappointing. The product placement of the Bentley seems a bit pointless - (I don't think it will be their target audience somehow) and, strangely, the most implausible part of the story.

If Scottish Screen gave me 300 thousand pounds, I'd spend it on stuff that was good, this isn't. Actually, if Scottish Screen gave me 300 thousand pounds I'd spend it on hit men, I'd put a hit out on each hit-man with another hit-man, then film the result, and it'd most likely be a lot better than this. I'm not really sure how many hits 300 thousand pounds buys you, might only be one, in which case I'd just spend it on tracking down the director of this abortion of a movie, and have a good strong word in his ear about how awful his film was, and maybe recommend in future that he doesn't make any more films because he's obviously not very good at it, he probably wouldn't listen though, but that's where the hit-man comes in.

While normally those things are usually put in the background, in Doomsday the fact-less glitches happen right on the front, dragging attention. They also jump up pretty often making me doubt everything I see.The setup in the movie was suitable to grab my interest wholeheartedly. In the beginning of the movie I was drawn in quite well, but the mentioned glitches started showing up too often to be ignored. Because they were so blatantly up front, I felt underestimated as a viewer. While I have never quit a movie while running, I had to reconsider a few times whether I should watch the movie to the end or not.The image was shook during the fight scenes enough to garble the view completely. I was left unclear what that was supposed to mean. To me it was plain distracting in this particular movie.The main characters motives were not backed up, so especially her decision at the end of the movie felt very stupid and without a reason. She was never shown as a person that would enjoy the situation she volunteered for.***SPOILERS***A few of the worst duds that come to mind:A new Bentley doesn't go faster than an old British taxi that's in terrible shape. - Main character doesn't even try to shake an enemy off a car's roof. (Mythbusters anyone?) - Mobile phones are sold with a SIM that will have service after 25 years. - A current production Volkswagen Phaeton will look new in 2035. - Motorbikes barely exceed running speed. - A Bentley doesn't get a scratch if driving through a bus. - When driven on a fallen motorbike, a van will explode and make a vertical flip. - A group of savages will make room if you drive straight at them. - If cut out from outside world, people will find lots of medieval weaponry but won't break into a gun store. - You can break in to an army's secret cave with a log. - When millions of people are quarantined, a soldier will sacrifice himself to save a young girl. - The window of an assault tank is easily broken with an axe. - If isolated from the western world, people in the cities will go all madmaxy and countryside will turn medieval, in only a few decades. - If jumping from a train that goes less than running speed, you must do a somersault. - Dehydration is never a problem in a movie.And of course, the main characters can't get hurt if they surrender to frightening armor wearing horsemen.Then the why's:Why did the horsemen shoot the one person that was least of danger to them? - How did the thousands of savages know when to hide from the team? - Why was there a Bentley luxury sports car in the secret army cave? - Why was the cave's main entrance made of a near nuclear-grade door, while the back door was merely a regular garden gate? - Why did the biker drive straight to the obstacle when he must've seen it the moment he entered the platform?",Doomsday

Can't filmmakers cut a film so we can SEE the action instead of trying to cut them for speed. It becomes totally unwatchable. MTV cutting style belongs to the MTV television channel and low budget bad movies.

326,aziraphale0,A no brainer,3,8 June 2008,"This film is bad on so many levels. Neil Marshal has proved himself to be a remarkable and inventive director and doomsday is no exception to his talents. However this film stinks. It plays like a two hour trailer and a Bentley advert. Style over content. What is this film about? Where is the humanity? The character development in this was nil. That is not to say the actors were crap, there was just no development. I will make a tiny exception for Malcolm Mcdowell but even he wasn't great. The opening 5 minutes or so were pretty good. The effects for people getting shot were remarkable, but the film moves so fast. The editing made me want to vomit and the music. It's unbelievable! It never relents. Just like a trailer the music never stops the editing is ruthless and the dialogue is made up of more one liners than a Roger Moore bond film! The motivations of most of the characters make no sense at all. The only reason I would recommend anyone to see this film is to show them how not to make a film. When I watch a film like doomsday I want see the plight of humanity. Or its decline but in a rational thought out way. In this sense, and I hate to say this, it is my least favourite sort of comment on here: it is completely unrealistic. Of course it is a fantasy, but in the fantasy should be a knowledge of cause and effect. An obvious point is the hair and make up, beautifully applied but these people all look like they've spent hours in make up rather than living like feral animals for years. There are so many holes in this film it makes the passion of the Christ look like fact.",Doomsday

I may very well have committed the crime of expecting something entirely different.I read in another comment that this is/could be considered as/may be a remake of Mad Max. For those who read this and use that comment as a baseline for viewing this movie, you are setting yourself up for a grave disappointment. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a blood-and-gore movie (which I have no objection to), but it has had intelligence and believability(!) surgically removed.The acting isn't that bad, and it sports some B+/A- names. Rhona Mitra in spandex? Sign me up. She is, in my opinion, The Hottest Woman on Earth. She also holds her own as an actress. Reference: Highway Men. As for the Hottest Woman on Earth remark, I offer Hollow Man as reference... :-) Bob Hoskins does what he always do, offer a crude, weathered every-day Joe, and he almost always does so in an likable and seemingly effortless manner. The rest of the cast, while doing their job, either fades into the background or falls victim of being some sort of stereotype or other.If you're expecting Mad Max, you're out of luck. But if you sit down expecting a blood-and-gore entertainer with lots of compelling Rhona-in-spandex shots, your review will in all likelihood sport far more than three stars.

337,MysteryView,Doomsday-light robbery!,1,27 May 2008,"OK where on earth to begin with this *Warning - Entire ""plot"" spoilers ahead* The year is 2008, the place is Scotland, and the plot might as well have already run out. The reaper virus (so generically named it physically pained me a little) has infected the majority of the population of the British country, leaving the wretched victims looking as if they have head-butted a swarm of cartoon bees. No time for explanations though, there's way too much gratuitous violence planned to waste time on such trifling inconveniences as 'plots'.So, they fence off Scotland (an entire country!) with a massive iron wall, erected so quickly that not a single person had a chance to escape (yeah, I know). Thirty years down the line, a girl who rolls her false eye around corners to see bad guys before popping it back in without fear of infection is blowing people away on a ship for some reason. Her colleague stumbles across a woman sitting butt naked in a bath tub (as you do on a filthy old tanker), solely for the sake of nudity. After much blood and death, we have one of many brief scenes with Bob Hoskins, presumably filmed without his consent (I'd rather believe that.) Eventually, our 'heroes' head into Scotland in search of renowned scientist Kane in two armoured battle tanks, impervious even to 'chemical weapons'. These are quickly destroyed by 80s punk rock savages armed to the teeth with a devastating arsenal of sharp sticks and rocks.When taken back to their painfully tacky rock amphitheatre, where barbaric acts of cannibalism are complimented by a delightful highland fling courtesy of kilt-clad cronies, Eden (the female lead) meets a woman claiming to be the daughter of mission target Kane, while also the sister of Sol, the leader of Duran Duran's lost groupies. This isn't expanded upon in any way, the interaction between these family members could be generously described as minimal, and before you can even attempt to work out just why the hell they even bothered, we're escaping on a steam train that not only works in a country cut off for thirty years, but just happens to be waiting at the station nearby, complete with an accomplice so generic that the ten minute countdown to his demise may as well be stamped on his forehead.After running through a pitch-black tunnel stuffed with hundreds of unopened crates, they end up in a forest where they're ambushed by knights. Yeah, actual knights. After carelessly dispatching aforementioned generic accomplice, they then lead our intrepid adventurers back to their castle, where the extras from the first series of Blackadder are apparently staging a reunion. They meet Kane, who babbles a bit before deciding, in a continuing trend of pointless clichés, that Eden should face an enormous, armoured warrior in a Gladiator-esquire confrontation. Obviously, considering she has no weapons or armour, she wins, leading to the castle inexplicably beginning to explode and the remainder of the gang making their escape once again.Back in the tunnel, they turn on the auxiliary power (which nobody has thought to do, and which still works) and open a crate. Out of literally hundreds of crates, the first one they open happens to contain a pristine Bentley. Ho-ho, I hear you cry! What use would that be? The tyres would be rotten, it would have no fuel in it, the battery would be flat, such an expensive car would be locked, and even if it wasn't, they don't have the keys So, next scene, they're driving the Bentley along a fantastically conditioned highway, fiddling with the mobile phone Eden found conveniently stored in the second and last of the hundreds of boxes in the tunnel she opened (which also works perfectly), when the 80s punk rock savages turn up on the vehicles deemed too ridiculous to feature in Wacky Races and a chase begins. Obviously, these clapped out rust-buckets easily keep pace with a top of the range Bentley, and also inexplicably have fuel, battery and tyres to set up the most hilarious car chase since the A-team was in its prime. It's just cars hitting each other and exploding for no real reason. The Bentley is rammed countless times, yet remains in immaculate condition throughout. After a confusing final fight which looks like the cameraman sat in the back seat of the car and just spun in circles for five minutes, the Bentley drives through a parked bus, which also inexplicably explodes, leaving the still spotless uber-car to drop off the survivors for a final utterly redundant plot device.If you can see this movie for free it is genuinely hilarious for those of you who, like myself, enjoy tearing crappy movies to pieces and can accept you will never see those two whole hours of your life ever again. The appalling acting, unfathomable plot and fantastically random explosions, offset by the gratuitous gore makes this film worth a go.

After 25 years of a supposedly people-empty Scotland, suddenly new humans appear in Glasgow that has had it's country's population erased after a deadly virus has had it's turn.

We can also obviously produce our own gasoline as well after 25 years, but we cannot do anything to clean up a Glasgow where the vegetation has had it's turn in the streets, oh well...

The acting is... Well, let's say a 6th grade drama class could probably have done much much better. Overacting and just bad acting is more the standard in this movie than exceptions. Several of the people in leading roles in this piece of manure should seriously consider giving up their acting careers if this movie is ANY kind of indication of what level they are at. The exceptions are there tho, Bob Hoskins does perform slightly above average, considering the incredibly bad script he must have been handed for this piece of sh*te (pardon my french). And I guess ms Rhona Mitra does a just above ""incredibly bad"" performance at points in the movie (although I am not sure if it's her hotness that is blinding me, she really does look nice in this movie). Plot holes. The movie is just one massive plot hole. There's so much wrong with both story, setting and environment, that after a while you simply give up and submit to the fact that absolutely no effort has been put in to make the plot of the movie coherent in any way shape or form. Scriptwriters, director and producer should all be deeply ashamed of this incredibly inept production they have committed and consider going back to their day jobs.Just avoid at all costs, this was a complete waste of time and money, the movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

I accept that he didn't have 1 good idea for a film so he used pieces of idea's to try and pay homage to the 80's i also accept this man has so far shown very little in the way of movie making talent and thus maybe i was expecting more? but instead of this film making me jump up and blow the trumpet of the 80's long and loud...i felt insulted to the point of wanting to find his damn house and ask for my £7 back! i felt like a bunch of kids had watched my favourite 20 films of the 80's and tried to squeeze parts in to please me, it felt desperate! like the fumbling hands of chubby ugly girl eager to please...and accordingly i felt ashamed and dirty afterwards!And like the aftermath of an encounter with an ugly, chubby girl, i was glad to go home and cry in the shower as i tried to get the stink of doomsday and shame off of my skin.",Doomsday
345,Starc73,Total Crap,1,7 August 2008,"***POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS IN TEXT*** ""Wow"" I thought to myself. A post apocalyptic movie is something that we haven't seen done very recently, at least not one of this style. At first glance, one could imagine a ""Mad Max"" feel or at least a movie that gives homage to the genre. Then while watching, it was quite clear that they had no idea what they actually wanted this movie to be. It actually splits itself into 3 very different genres with very clear cut lines in between. I was watching the movie and then all of the sudden, I was in a whole different genre then I was just in a second ago. And that will happen several times throughout the film. The characters were weak, the plot was non existent, so many story lines were unresolved, and the acting was atrocious. If you want to see a lot of screaming, punk rocker psychopaths, severed limbs, horrible acting, and a bit of King Arthur's court...then this may be for you.",Doomsday

Full of clichés, illogical directions, over the top nonsensical action scenes, lousy characters, annoying, ...Really it angers me how a good idea is turned in to such a cringing and facepalming orgy.It is slightly better than Terminator 4, but considering how bad T4 was don't get your hopes up. The only way this movie could have worked is if it was released in 1980 and even then it would make you squeak in pain.If you like this genre i do recommend seeing it, maybe it will excite you a few times, but mostly to see how a good movie doesn't look like.",Doomsday
347,TheWhiteShadow,All your favorite movies rolled into one.,7,25 March 2008,"This movie seemed to be more clips from director Neil Marshall's favorite films than a new post-apocalyptic movie. There are the obvious references to the Mad Max series with high speed chase involving punks in their totally punked out cars, and the Escape from NY/LA movies with the whole premise of the movie and the one-eyed hero. There are also tidbits that resemble (very highly) Gladiator and Lord of the Rings. There is even a castle that looks straight out of Braveheart (it was set in Scotland, so it does fit kinda).While it's obvious there is nothing revolutionary, or even vaguely inventive about this movie, it doesn't mean it wasn't fun to watch. If you are a fan of post-apocalypse films, like I am, you can just sit back and enjoy the ride.If any of you are still doubting this gore filled action film let me add one more thing: I felt my $8 ticket was completely justified by the scene with the exploding bunny.",Doomsday

349,torre_romance,Inconsistent........but not the worst of this genre.,6,7 August 2008,"I noticed that the overall rating of this movie is 6.2 (I would give it a flat 6) and in my opinion that is a fair rating. Over the years there has been a number of these films about widespread virus infected zombies that cannibalize anyone that is not infected, but this movie is far from the worst of the bunch (that would have to be Land of The Dead). This film was not as ""zombie"" oriented as the others though.However the film was very inconsistent in a number of areas, for example; the Scottish cannibal leader gives a performance on-stage that clearly used a sound system but Scotland was void of electricity for the past nearly 3 decades. I also though that the dynamic between the two groups of survivors living in Scotland could have been explained better. There is a number of other flaws to the plot but they are not completely detrimental to the flow of the film. There is enough blood and guts throughout to keep you entertained for the entire 100+ minutes of runtime. Although this movie was not as bad as I expected it to be from the trailers, it is still not as good as Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, or Resident Evil 2. Like I said, it's not the best but a fair rental if your in the mood for this type of flick.",Doomsday
350,leka9,"A good flick for those who are into the movies it is ""inspired"" from!",7,11 December 2008,"This is my first review, so those who expect the Ebert-ish piece can freely move on to some other review. Same goes for those that expect that Doomsday is the new Citizen Cane or even those that are looking for something, anything new in this movie! Doomsday is lots of déjà vu-s combined together, rather nicely. Perhaps the movie is intended to be homage to the movies it so shamelessly resembles, perhaps not, but the bottom line is that it is not the new Aliens, it is not the new Escape from NY, and it is not even the new Mad Max! (Also, please do not continue if you are not a fan of the aforementioned movies).Is it an enjoyable piece of cinema? To me it was, and based on other reviews and comments, it is to a lot of other people too.The story is as un-imaginative as it can be; a deadly virus outbreak, a quarantine zone that turns into a post-modern mayhem with a dictatorship on the other side. Of course, something is about to go very wrong and of course it is nothing more interesting that the virus appearance on the other side of the wall. A team of military, police and scientist is sent to investigate the quarantined zone for a cure of a vaccine. Now, if the producers had found a way to continue this with a story that would be equally good (however cliché-d) as till the one up to this point, I would give this movie a 10 or at least a 9. But they didn't, the setting(s) and the story go downhill from there. It never reaches a point bellow a 5 though! Acting is not bad. Rhona Mitra looks very good here and her ability to act is good enough for this particular production. In fact, I think that however funny it sounds, her acting was a little over the top, as the others captured a little too seriously the fact that this is purposely-intended-to look-like a B-movie. All in all, I was not fascinated with acting, but not disappointed either.Oh, I forgot to mention: there are no zombies in this movie! Not the Romero zombies, not the 28-days later zombies, no zombies at all. There are somewhat cannibalistic post apocalyptic punk(s) but no zombies, no mutants and no infected that chase the un-infected.Overall production values of the movie are as good as it gets. Cinematography is very good, so is the directing. They could have probably do it without using the famous ""check those corners"" from Aliens more then once, but still it is far from the worst movie you have ever seen.

It has some of the strangest/weirdest characters like cannibals, knights, emos, a human ""pet"" carried around on a leash (this would be one of the weirdest characters and we loved him) and people with purple mohawks.

Having seen it, I can say this is going to be the sleeper genre fans going to love with all of their hearts. There is black comedy (covered in LOTS of human, cow, and one poor bunny gore) straight out of the primes of both Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson. There is tone, characters, dialog, synth heavy score, EFNY style 1970s vector graphics/computer generated maps, and even the same style credits font from the prime of John Carpenter. There is over the road action involving vehicles and violent psychopaths that is equal to if not better (thanks to the black comedy sprinkled in) than the best of George Miller and Mad Max.I literally beg of you, if the names I reference are dear and near to your heart, please go see this movie.",Doomsday

But rather than being straight rips or ""better directorial"" reinterpretations that claim to far outshine the original - my main arguments against remakes and sequels- these unoriginalities are tributes. You can tell this by the delicate and almost reverent way Neil treats the scenes, with an almost visible bow to the original genius he is honoring. Now you have to be a true fan and very well-versed in the classics of the genre to even notice what I'm talking about, but Neil does a masterful job of duplicating and conglomerating, not just plot points or general scenes but truly even the camera angles and lighting of the originals, giving the older movies (not that they need any help) more attention by drawing the uneducated moviegoer's eye to the scenes that were truly inspired. He does what I'd like to do- takes his favorite scenes and music, creates a new plot in which they might bind seamlessly together, and thus creates a NEW action movie that more than thrills you- it inspires you and at the same time pays homage to the greats that went before him. He's an action movie junkie, like me. He has great characters, wonderful style and - of course - tons of action. There will be times in this movie the action junkie will lose his breath and think, WOW! He's trained with the greats! (Think of it like this- in reading a story, do you think less of the writer if he is capable of integrating the styles and themes of Homer and Virgil, or do you think of him as a masterful artist who hasn't forgotten his roots?)Now, I've loved Neil Marshall since his DOG SOLDIERS days, and am glad to see him getting a bigger budget. I am also so thrilled he decided to use it on Rhona Mitra and Bob Hoskins, two actors I greatly enjoy. Tyler Bates seemed to be mimicking his director in this movie, by using the opportunity to pay homage to the greats of his category - scores. Several of the overtures will not only sound familiar- as a lot of music does today- but if you have a really discerning ear, you'll know exactly what it is, and why he's using it. Now, it's not Scream 2 obvious, but it is fairly so.All in all, I've seen it once, and I have every intention of seeing it again.Ten out of ten!(PS. If you want original plots where you need a pad and pencil, and guide notes and maybe even a chart, to follow it- try the Oscar winners or some of those new kid's movies.

Neil Marshall's storytelling blueprint is simple, effective, and uncompromising. If you want a chameleon for a director, go for Bruckheimer.Hell, half the people complaining about this movie can't even spell 'soldiers' (the latter half of his first theatrical film's title).He had NO CGI in Doomsday. It still is the the most expensive gore movie ever made, and probably will be until he makes another one. As with Stanley Kubrick (another bashed yet revered director, known for his commitment to his own style), he has stood out as a director. When you sit down for a Marshall movie, you may not know the premise, but you sure as hell know what is about to go down. The nuances make the case, as every artist that was not the first artist in history will attest. I cannot wait for more. Neil Marshall is one of the most gifted directors AND writers around. Mr. Marshall, you stand among the heavyweights, and I salute you for making cinema cool again, just like Rodriguez, Tarantino, Miller, Carpenter, Kubrick, and Lee.Doomsday is my second favorite movie of all time.",Doomsday

Script is trivial and predictable with good guys, bad guys and a super-hero. This is a kind of action flick to watch after the hard day work out when your brain is switched off and just demands some moving pictures, thankfully film boasts good FX and cinematography to allow that.

I went into this film expecting something different and from what I saw in the previews, old school. I got just that and more. I could not stop smiling from start to finish as the camera took us to a world of anarchy and raw violence. The movie felt as whole as any and thanks to some simple narration at the beginning and fully developed sets and environments it felt real, and by that I don't mean realistic or feasible but just whole. Thats all I can say there... Rhona Mitra was hot and sexy and was perfectly cast. The action was raw and intense and while some cuts felt rushed I never felt like I was missing out. The camera was constantly doing creative things while never stretching itself to far. In a world of Bourne-like action movies, this is a refreshing entry in to the action movie genre. It will make you laugh from pure humor but also the nostalgic feeling of how classic the movie feels at times. This one isn't for everyone, like I said, but if you enjoyed Water World or others like it, you will love this movie. It makes me happy to see Hollywood spending money on these movies and giving them a chance again. Hands down my favorite of 2008 so far.(10,000 B.C. and Jumper can die...) P.S.

The acting is good, as are all of the features of movie-making, such as editing, casting, etc. I don't mean this will win any Oscars or even be nominated for them, but there is little to complain about in that department.The plot itself was a bit spotty, but I found that the setting more than made up for any shortcomings there. Rhona Mitra plays a great lead role, and some of my fears about the Underworld prequel have already been proved groundless. The setting is fantastic; there is the futuristic society, the mad max scenario, and a sort of medieval system in another part of the movie. The wide variety this movie offers in term of setting, events, and even genre fulfill my every wish for this film.If you are thinking about going to this movie, and seems in the least bit interested, I advise you to not hesitate and go see it ASAP.",Doomsday
370,carbonbaseunit2,Gave it a chance...,2,22 March 2008,"All I could think while watching this was ""Is this supposed to be an homage to John Carpenter?"" If it was it wasn't a very good one. Poor acting all around along with terrible dialogue made this film pretty unbearable. It felt like a rip-off of better movies rather than a hat tip to them. I wanted to like this as I liked other films in the same genre (i.e. Dawn of the Dead, 28 days later, Escape from New York, Road Warrior, etc.) but the whole thing was so jumbled due to bad plot and horrible direction that I went away feeling confused. The ending has been done in so many movies so much better that all I could do was laugh at the screen.

Randomly went to the movie and turns out that it had a pretty good plot line. Even though it was a doomsday situation, I liked how it had some elements that were new. It did steal or copy a lot of concepts from movies such as Mad Max and Resident Evil. The part that I really liked **spoiler** is the fact that the secluded area was divided into two factions and one were barbaric in a modern sense as in they used a lot of the old stuff left behind and the other side pretty much went medieval. I also liked how they touched on concept of ""survival of the fittest"". Overall, the action scenes were pretty good along with lots of gore. The only thing that I didn't really like was the advertisement of the Bentley Continental GT and how it was pretty much indestructible and how the cars blew up the second they ran into something (I guess that is Hollywood in general). Overall, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of science fiction.",Doomsday

373,jbreneman,"Good acting, good cinematography, horrible plot",2,13 August 2008,"Upon seeing 3 great actors cast in this film (MacDowell, Siddig & Hoskins) I had high hopes. I was sorely upset by what I saw.-The lead character just comes off as too ""bad ass"" and there just isn't any enough reason or rhyme for her actions. Besides seeing her mother killed as a little girl, there is hardly anything to her. Just just a vivacious bad ass capable of anything without a moment's thought. Utterly silly.-From the beginning, that massive wall that was erected overnight along the Scottish border seemed like total malarkey. The faceless soldiers firing upon civilians seemed a stretch too, I mean it is a small country, no doubt those soldiers would have among those civilians some friends and family. It isn't like the civilians were murderous zombies or anything.-It was hard to believe that they just cordoned off this whole area, not publicly knowing for 30 years that people were still alive there, and never once sending in a team of scientists into an area where this plague is obviously not air borne.-The armored vehicles that were made to look so impressive with 2035 technology sure didn't stand up very well to a few Molotov cocktails. And the soldiers that completely wigged out so soon must have been the rejects of training.-When the soldiers accompanying the lead character did die off, I didn't really give a crap because frankly their characters just weren't built up to that point to where I should. It seemed as if the director was just jumping to and fro just as haphazardly as the writers.-It was humorous to see that after 30 years of complete neglect that the rail lines and even more surprisingly the ELECTRICITY was still completely functional, despite having been left to derelict. There must be no utility workers today in Scotland I guess, being that their system are so indestructible.-A sweet Bentley that must have had a hatchback V6 ramming into it seemed just as perplexing, but at this point everything was so farcical I didn't much care.In the end, she leads the band of cannibal mad-men. The writers just went off the deep end on this one.",Doomsday
374,Demonicuss,Decent if you've never seen a movie before this one,3,11 August 2008,"I'm sorry, but this movie has very little to offer. I'm usually pretty open minded about movies but I couldn't stand this.The whole thing is predictable from the first minute to the very end. There's no way the story would unfold the way it does, things would not have shaped up to be the way they turned out, the costumes were all generic, cars exploded on contact, the characters were hollow and in some cases over the top...The whole thing is a big rip off of previous movies such as mad max. It just boggles my mind that something can be so generic. No surprises, no big moments, and thats after you overlook many of the loopholes in the story.On a positive note, the leading lady does do a good job being an unemotional badass.

Although it is a good insight to Scotland, if the United Kingdom were to give them political independence. However there are 2 major problems within the story which made me soo frustrated, it really tainted the remainder of the movie.For instance during the Armored tank chase, they said the tank could take shots from a 9mm gun easily, however some punk with a bad temper and a baseball bat with nails can smash through the window?!?! It's just not possible.Also a Bentley GT has a 6.0L engine producing 552bhp with a top speed of 198mph, and they are unable to outrun 27 year old dirt bikes and whats looks and sounds like a 1960's American muscle car, in Scotland no less.

The whole movie is unoriginal and badly acted; the only saving grace is Rhona Mitra who is just about believable as the sexy bad-ass major. The movie rolls along at a not practically fast pace joining together unconnected actions sequences which does nothing to move the story forward. The car chase towards the end of the movie looks like it could have been outtakes from Mad Max, and with a Bentley Turbo which could have outrun any of the pursuing vehicles never seems to get so much as a scratch even after driving straight through a bus! The DVD version is a little extended over the theatrical version and I'm not sure this helps, other than to take my time that I'd rather use pulling my toenails out, which would have been more enjoyable.",Doomsday
377,MissladyX3,Shook with laughter instead of fright. And not in a good way...,3,1 November 2008,"This movie was absolutely ridiculous! So let me get this straight: Scotland in the year 2007 had to be quarantined because of some incurable virus called the ""reaper virus"" which caused everyone to bleed out of their pores and die. The rest of the world leaves them there for dead, and now, 30 years later, the virus shows up in London. So they send a group of bad ass people or an ""elite group of specialist"" to try and find a doctor who they believe may still be alive in the containment zone and possesses a cure. Once they get there they find a large number of ""punk anarchists"" still living and ruling what's left of their city while feeding off human flesh, even though there are seemingly juicy herds of cows just waiting to be made into big macs. The thing that really confuses me is that everyone seems to be healthy again which does stretch the imagination since the entire population was ""quarintined"" behind huge steel walls for 30 years with no trucks full of food entering or exiting. Plus how long can you possibly live off human flesh, let alone the flesh of your own people!? I've watched many ""Sci Fi, end of the world, save the human race"" movies.

I am going to stop with the comparisons, so should you people as it is a pathetic attempt at a review. The only thing DOOMSDAY has in relation to any of these films is a virus or walled city or character clothing. Those THREE points are in no way remotely similar to the way they are used in the previous movies.Neil Marshall's DOOMSDAY is an entertaining gore riddled science fiction ACTION film. I emphasize ACTION because it follows that standard. Action sequence, some plot, action sequence, some plot, action sequence, some plot, with very little character development or surprising twists. It is a straight forward ACTION movie. If you want character development then go watch a drama.Neil Marshall has crafted one hell of an entertaining experience. A non-stop action extravaganza. Interlaced with black comedy and extreme gore with a gorgeous heroine. The only REAL HOMAGE in DOOMSDAY is the car chase. I had read interviews with Neil where he stated that he wanted the car chase to be more like MAD MAX. Otherwise the rest of the movie stands well on its own two feet. DOOMSDAY is not groundbreaking but neither are Neil's previous films, however they are extremely entertaining and enjoyable over and over again.Thanks Neil, I for one love all of your work and am sad to see that you don't have anything to do with Dog Soldiers 2.",Doomsday

385,MrGoodB,28 Years Later: Escape from LV-246,2,4 November 2008,"Now this one is what you see when you look up ""letdown"" in a dictionary. It started out decent, even promising, with a suitably gloomy introduction that, while not exactly what I would call innovative, set the mood very nicely: in the near future, the fatal Reaper virus decimated Scotland and now threatens to makes all human life in the UK a thing of the past. Extreme conditions demand extreme responses, and so the government revives the time-honored British tradition of building humongous barriers across the country. Hadrian's Wall 2.0 is finally finished, the gates are welded shut, the automated sentry guns come online (much to the dismay of the local fauna), what's left of Scotland is sealed off from the rest of the world and everyone is happy. Problem solved, or is it?Of course, it's not, and three decades later, the virus rears its ugly head again, only this time in London. Understandably troubled, the government assembles an elite team of assorted badasses with security clearances, among them captivating police officer Eden (!) Sinclair and sends them over the wall to meet up with Dr. Kane (!!), who, according to recent satellite reconnaissance, might be alive after all and might even have the cure for the Reaper virus.This, unfortunately, is the turning point for the movie, which, in an eerie mirroring of the events unfolding on screen, veneers from hey-this-ain't-so-bad highway straight into dark, uncharted I-can't-believe-that-somebody-greenlighted-this territory. Let me explain: the group enters Scotland by means of two wheeled, heavily armored APC's, which, as we are explicitly told, were built to protect its passengers from each and every harm that might lurk on the Other Side (capitalized for dramatic effect). After running over a cow (those things can be tricky at night), the group exits the vehicles and searches an abandoned hospital for clues, while the operator stays put and watches their progress via helmet-mounted cameras on the APC's impressive array of screens. If that description vaguely reminded you of some other movie, you are absolutely right: the entire scene is lifted straight from ""Aliens"". The fear that ""Doomsday"" would merely turn into a bad copy of said movie was unfounded, however, because it quickly becomes apparent that ""Doomsday"" also aspires to become a bad copy of several other movies, including but not limited to the 28... Later and Mad Max series, Waterworld, Gladiator and Lord of the Rings. After getting attacked by a gang of mohawked punks straight from the ""Escape from New York"" set, the slightly shaken group flees into the soothing steel embrace of their nigh-indestructible tank things. Little good it does them, as these marvels of military technology are quickly destroyed by a combination of molotov cocktails, arrows and bricks (I couldn't make this up if I tried) in a chase scene again lifted directly from Aliens. The survivors are taken prisoner and we encounter a ragtag society of garishly dressed maniacs who burn alive and devour one of the captives while playing a Fine Young Cannibals tune (my, that's clever) in a scene that tries to be both scary and funny and fails to be either. Of course, the survivors MIRACULOUSLY manage to escape - on a steam train, waiting for them in a nearby station, no less. Don't ask. Wandering around the Highlands for a bit while not resembling the Fellowship of the Ring at all, they finally traverse a mountain range by means of a gigantic, underground storage bunker filled with mysterious and obviously completely untouched containers, crates and boxes. After getting kidnapped by some knights on horses, encountering the elusive Dr. Kane  who now rules a pseudo-medieval community based in a castle - and defeating his best fighter in a breathtaking and totally unexpected turn of events, the group escapes once again, re-enters the Warehouse of Moria, opens one of the millions of containers nobody ever bothered to look at twice in 30 years of passing through and finds  huzzah! - a shiny new Bentley Continental. The tiresome punks from Act I make their reappearance and give chase, only to be killed off in various unexciting ways by the strangely slow but completely indestructible Bentley. Well, whatever. I won't give away the ending, lest I spoil the surprise (ho, ho). 2/10 (one star for the first five minutes).",Doomsday

The survivors are divided into two camps - psycho punks (Beoynd Thuderdome rip off) but the other has gone 100% medieval (wtf). And the nonsense just begins there. The psycho punks have motorbikes, cars and buses in full working order and with enough petrol even after 30 years of isolation. There's an extended Lexus commercial towards the end of the movie in which the mentioned car manages to actually jump through and tear apart a reinforced bus. Without a scratch.

387,the_curmudgeon_hates_you,Abandon all hope all ye who enter the cinema,1,25 May 2008,"For those of you who have read a few of my reviews from my website or from Amazon, this is actually a bit of a first for The Curmudgeon; this is the first time I've actually reviewed a movie while its still in the cinema. Which would be fine, except it means I wasted my money going to see this. Ho hum.Anyway, here's the plot for ""Doomsday"" before we get started; a virus breaks out on er, well, April 03 2008 (should that be ""has broken out""?) in Glasgow, killing pretty much everyone. So a giant wall is built around Scotland separating them from the rest of healthy Britain, leaving the Scots to perish. All is well until, 30 years later, London starts to show signs of the virus, and so they have to send someone (Rhona Mitra, sporting a fake eye that lets her see round corners.. yeah, I know) to try and find a cure from the newly discovered survivors in Scotland.With me so far? Well, it's hard to know where to start with this one. I mean, as this is my first ever theatrical review, I don't want to give away too much of the plot for those who haven't yet seen it, and so I can't really say too much or give away just how deeply, brain-smashingly stupid it all gets.It's a real shame it has to be this way, Doomsday coming from writer/director Neil Marshall, the same guy who brought us the ultra ace ""Dogs Soldiers"" and the slightly inferior but still ace ""Descent"" has obviously sat and watched a load of awesome 80s movies and thought, ""hey.. I can do that."" Hey Neil - no you can't.Here's a small hint for Neil; if you're going to steal little bits from, say, ""Aliens"" (the big tank things in Doomsday even have the same ""door opening"" sound effect as the big tank things in that super sequel), fairly large bits like, say, the barbaric neo-punks from ""Mad Max"" or big bits like, say, most of the plot of ""Escape From New York"", (complete with a brooding 80s synth score) then its best not to have the audience wish they were watching those movies instead of this bewildering mess.What's annoying is that, for the first forty minutes or so, its a fairly convincing, (dare I say the word ""gritty""?) portrayal of a country gripped by a disease it can't cure. Its a sombre watch, all death, decay and violence, backed up by suitably restrained performances from the likes of Bob Hoskins.Remember that word, ""restrained"", because its the last time you'll see it here.So far, so good then. In fact, the first time the group of soldiers are attacked by the savage survivors is a taught, frightening nerve-jangler. And.. then.. just like that, it absolutely, positively NOSE-DIVES.Honestly, its like two different movies have been strung together. If you're going to show a realistic depiction of a dying country, its hard to stomach surreal scenes of the barbaric hordes, complete with MICROPHONES and stadium sound, performing dance routines for each other. Never mind the fact that three quarters of the cast at this point have seemingly forgotten how to act, the film has quickly lost its realism and scare-factor - in fact, its all a little embarrassing.Sadly, it only gets worse from there. When they meet the next band of survivors its like they've stumbled back in time, with every single person dressed like extras from the first Blackadder movie, complete with KNIGHTS on horses, peasants wrapped in shawls and other versions of perfect period costume. When it comes to the most ridiculous car chase scene in history (with our heroine driving a mint condition Bentley that is seemingly made from the same indestructible material K.I.T.T was built with) you'll either be laughing in the aisles, queuing up to get your money back or facing the most ""HUH?"" ending ever. Its at this point that logic has been completely removed from Doomsday, and there are several crater size plot holes I won't mention here, and let you find out for yourself.With Rhona Mitra's character Eden, it's clear Marshall was aiming for a super cool, Snake Plissken character. She fails. She's not believable or even that likable, and the various no-mark fodder that she tags along with are barely worth the screen time. The main cannibal, Sol, is too over the top and too badly acted to be any kind of menacing screen presence, and Malcolm McDowell actually looks embarrassed to be there. Who can blame him? Basically, there are about 100 films that deserve your attention this year, and while it would be nice to cast a vote for the ""little"" film that could, this one most certainly couldn't.Don't waste your time.www.thecurmudgeon.proboards88.com",Doomsday
388,remo4512,There's a difference between homage and rip-off.....,1,20 March 2008,"And those that actually enjoyed this piece of drivel don't know what that it is.My friend practically begged me to go see this movie, because he figured this would be the closest thing to a new Mad Max film as were going to get. Unfortunately, what we got was a rehash of MM2 and 3, along with Escape From New York and a bunch of other post- apocalyptic films. But those three were easily identifiable.Now, an homage would be to name two DDS agents in the film Miller and Carpenter -- like Marshall did in this film. But to actually take whole scenes, conversations and stunts/death scenes from the films George Miller and John Carpenter made is a blatant rip-off.First off, the same graphics used to show the wall around Scotland were used in Escape From New York back in 1981. THEN, our hero has 48 hours to go into said isolated area and extract something very important to the crux of the film. And if she doesn't recover it in time or find anything, her superiors tell her not to bother coming out. HELLO! I mean come on, they even give her an eye patch for parts of this! Even the music is a rip-off from EFNY when they're in the city.Then, when she busts out of her jail cell, she even kills a dude in the EXACT same fashion Mad Max killed a guy in the Road Warrior. I honestly sat there in the theater asking when a taxi-driving Ernest Borgnine was gonna save these idiots, and where the orphaned kids chanting someone else's name were.This whole move was nothing but Neil Marshall's favorite elements from these two films (and others).

I went in expecting it to be so bad after I read the reviews, but was entertained for the whole time I was in there, it reminded me of what it was to be a boy in the mid eighties and see all these films for the first time and then go to school the next day and quote the lines and argue about whether Arnie is better than Stallone and recreate the fights from beyond thunderdome.if you have any kind of love or that macho cyberpunky 80's scifi action genre I'm sure you will find something to like in this film.",Doomsday

Amazingly the actors, some of which are very big names, do a fine job and the production work isn't bad at all. If it hadn't been a replay of so many other scenes, ideas, strategies, it could easily have been a start up for a U.K. series of post-apocalyptic films... but that didn't happen.As BAD as the film is, it still retains that U.K. charm that makes us watch it again to see if we can catch even more things cobbled together from earlier films, or gives us the hope that we've accidentally stumbled onto a director's cut that might be a bit more original.Still... you're reading this to determine if you should watch it?

I found out later that I would somewhat regret this decision. Doomsday started out brilliant: it had good story-telling elements mixed with decent action sequences. However, the first half hour of the movie was super-charged while the rest was slightly slower with less story. Also, there were way too many parts that just did not fit with the rest of the movie. SPOILER ALERT!! Towards the middle of the movie, the infected capture the main cast and take them back to some kind of fortress where they rock hard and eat a few people that were cooked over a fire. Shortly after this, the crew was taken to a partial castle where the main heroine had a short battle where she defeated a man in heavy armor. SPOILERS OVER!! These parts just completely warped my viewpoint of this movie. I will admit, it was very good at some parts. Without giving anything away, there is a chase scene at the end that carried on for about 10 minutes that was adrenaline-charged and well done.

393,m_j_ray,AKA - Overly-Dramatic Exposition-Spewers Desperately Seeking a Cure for the Plot-Hole Virus,4,10 November 2009,"Let me get it out of the way right at the start - this film is bad. Like, really bad. But it's not -terrible-.And there are a number of reasons why...The budget and special effects are pretty reasonable. They're not great but they're certainly good enough.The acting, given what they have to work with, is also pretty decent. Sean Pertwee is criminally underused and Bob Hoskins probably leaves this title off his CV but all in all the acting is okay. Even when the dialogue clunks, the actors give it a good go and do okay, so long as you listen more to their tone than what they're actually saying.The photography and sound are also good - lighting levels are fine, the camera work and shots are good, the music fits and the sound effects are more than adequate.Same goes for the stylings of the movie. Even if the bad guys are rather heavily inspired by Mad Max, their costumes look well-made and fit the movie; same goes for the armour wielded by the defence force expedition.The plot - a viral mini-apocalypse - is more than a tad over-used of late (28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later, Resident Evil, etc, etc.) but it's a slightly fresh spin on the idea. Fresh enough, at least, not to be unpalatable.So what IS wrong with the movie? Well, I hinted at it when commenting on the acting - it's the script. I'll be blunt: it ****ing sucks. If there's one thing you really don't want to screw up in a movie, it's the script. Just as a well-written script can survive a low budget and wonky acting, even the best acting and budget cannot rescue a dire script and this is one of the worst scripts I've ever come across. Which amazes me, considering that this is from the same genius mind that brought us the mother of all werewolf movies - Dog Soldiers.Where to start in saying where it's gone wrong? And where to finish?There are plot holes that are more like chasms and exposition that seems to be aimed at people who live under rocks... A scientist working in a military base needs to have the term ""line of fire"" explained to him. The Prime Minister and his top advisers (who must have slept through the whole process of Scotland being quarantined) need Bob Hoskins to explain to them what might happen if half of London is closed off from the outside world and left to rot with a killer virus (""Rape, murder, arson, rioting, pillaging"" to paraphrase). Soldiers fleeing a quarantine zone readily agree to rescue the wounded child of a woman they've never met before and of the soldiers even sacrifices his life for the kid, despite them having no idea whether or not she's infected with the same virus that's currently obliterating Scotland's population. Thirty years after the complete downfall of society and isolation from the rest of the world, there's still enough booze and petrol in Scotland for them to have a few thousand Molotov cocktails to hand and power a generator that's running a sound and light show, as well as have motorbikes zooming around; they also have a load of paper plates and cans of beer that appear to have been kept in time capsules for the past three decades. ""Half the {English} capital"" apparently consists of the borough of Hackney and not a lot else, and THAT has 12 million people living in it. And where the heck did the infected guy with the axe pop up from? And why did they not think to evacuate the Prime Minister and his buddies -before- trying to isolate London? I'd go on further but there's a word limit on these things ;)Now, maybe it's a little picky of me to highlight and point out these rather glaring errors and if there were only a couple of them I'd probably just ignore them and enjoy what is an otherwise decent popcorn- muncher of a movie. But to have so many holes in the plot of just one movie and for them all to be rather gaping holes is a bit hard for me to ignore. That plus it just looks like absolutely no research or thought was put into the script and it was knocked out one rainy afternoon after a few beers and scribbled hastily on a pad, with no sort of editing process going on before being actualised. That said, the movie does start to pick up after they leave the city and end up accepting Malcolm McDowell's hospitality - though the flashes of ""what's going on in London"" do rather spoil what would otherwise be an acceptable attempt at rescuing the movie in the final third.In a way, I feel bad. I really, really liked Dog Soldiers - it was fun, funny, sassy, knew its limitations and had some absolutely exceptional lines, all delivered brilliantly. So for me to lay into another work from the same man feels... cruel and ungrateful. But Doomsday really hasn't done much to warrant any sort of kindness from me.So I gave it 4 - one because it's got Sean ""I make mediocre movies GREAT"" Pertwee in it (would have been two if he wasn't so frustratingly under- used); one because Rhona Mitra is pretty decently believable as the gruff, tough, hard-as-nails Maj. Sinclair; one because the action sequences are actually rather good if you don't think about them and the final point because I REALLY liked Dog Soldiers!",Doomsday
394,leme666,Horrible... just horrible,1,18 August 2010,"Pardon me for my English mistakes, since it ain't my first language.So... I had just finished watching REC (Which by the way is a terrific film, I recommend it.), and I was looking for another movie with a similar subject, viruses outbreaks and all of that. I came upon this, read the plot, and figured it sounded pretty good! After all, Malcolm McDowell's in it, and a couple of good actors.Terrible choice.The movie started all intense, gory and intriguing. Then... They once they stepped into the quarantine zone, it just went downhill. That was about when I realized I should have read some reviews, so anyways, they start fighting a bunch of punks, who are cannibals and have no principles, however, they have hair dye and gel to make those mo-hawks. Their apparently kick ass invincible 2035 tanks get blown up and cut up in a few minutes by the same punks, the tanks have absolutely no weapons to defend themselves. Anyways, once that's done, they managed to run away in a train? Into a forest, where there's a tunnel with a lot of untouched containers.After that, they meet up with KNIGHTS, they surrender and get arrested inside a castle, then the main character becomes a gladiator for a few minutes. Once their riot inside the castle is done, they go back into the underground tunnels, only to find a brand new invincible and incredibly slow Bentley to run away from the knights, only to meet up with the punks again!I won't spoil it much more. Then, I realized that if Road Runner and Gladiator had a kid, then Waterworld and Lord of The Rings had a kid...and by some miracle those two kids had another kid! This is what would come out, and it would also be born 28 Days Later than it was supposed to! Not worth your time, don't even bother.",Doomsday

396,Dean-29,Doomsday - a film gone wrong.,2,20 August 2008,"Spoilers ahead!A complete reviewThe premise of the movie starts out OK, a virus has wiped out most of Scotland. The government locks the borders down.Years go by and the virus is found in London. They decide to send in a crack team to find survivors. What makes them think there are survivors? Satellite photos show a few people in the streets of the cities. They cross the wall, pass through a massive herd of cattle and into a city. Suddenly as they are investigating an empty building HUNDREDS of people attack. It turns out this city is populated and thriving with cannibal ROAD WARRIOR extras (who apparently don't eat cow meat).They have gasoline for vehicles, buses, motorcycles, and even a steam train. A steam train for god's sake. Then they hold a rock concert as they eat one of the heroes. None of this technology was apparently visible from the satellite photos.With scenes like this: A soldier says ""Its all clear"" and suddenly motorcycles jump over their heads, this movie is a lost cause.This movie isn't' about logic, its about using props and locations that the production company found cheap or free. It is a random series of action scenes strung together by having the actors exit one location and entering another for no reason. Well, they ARE looking for the great Kane who can help them, but fortunately his son is the evil cannibal leader, and his daughter (in the next cell) is there to help them escape. The female lead (who remarkably resembles Kate Beckinsale) easily escapes and beheads a woman with 2 swords.After running into knights on horseback (no I am not kidding), they are taken to Kane's castle. He tells them there is no cure, just natural selection. As London dies, the Prime Minister gets infected blood on him. Rather than waiting to see if he is immune, he instantly kills himself because the script hasn't had any bloodshed for a while. The Kate clone must then do battle in an arena with a Lord of the Rings orc in armor. She wins. Then the only black man in the show defeats the castle's entire defenses only to be shot in the back as they waste time. Luckily they find a brand new car in storage (but not really in storage as it is ready to go), and they escape down the freaking brand new highway, only to be chased by Kane's son who somehow decided they would be going this way. With the music of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, this movie sure isn't. The gang, complete with a pickup truck carrying a special effects wind machine chases them as the editor can't make up his mind what shots to use... so he uses them all. They drive through a bus that explodes like it was made of high explosive, to stop 500 yards away to meet the helicopter. Kane's daughter flys away as Kateclone stays to become the leader of the Scottish cannibals.This movie rates 2 out of 10.",Doomsday
397,robertsrusko,"A good plot, but the movie doesnt know what it wants to be...",4,9 March 2019,"Never been a fan of long reviews so I am going to keep it short.
Doomsday, in my opinion, had a great plot...A virus killing millions, with nothing to stop it. A country isolating half of its people leaving them to die, with the world watching and ''Turning its back on Britain''... Sounds appealing, doesn't it?Introduction to this movie was very appealing. It gave you that 28 days later vibe that you don't get often. BUT...It all turns in a mess when the time jump happens. Suddenly that little girl we saw at the beginning of the movie turns in to a ''Underworld'' style professional killer, with sci-fi elements added to it, that are almost a bit ridiculous (I mean the eye).The fact that the rule of law has fallen at the other side of the wall is understandable, but here the issue escalates.
Why do the survivors have to be a mad max ripoff?The inventor of the cure has turned to medieval ways, living in a casle eventually giving no benefit to the story, because at the end he didn't even make a cure.At the end of the movie, the real bad guy blame has been turned on to the government agent.The movie itself struggles with identity, it feels sped up at awkward moments, overall, the movie has some unneeded moments with hard to explain scenarios.

With soundtrack, set design and costume conspiring to delude us that the 80s apocalyptic movie (a la Escape From New York or The Running Man) never left us, it's a wonder I haven't broken out my Frankie Goes to Hollywood back catalogue.In all honesty, there's a chance this might have looked good on paper - a bit of fun, daft storyline, a large cast of relatively interesting characters, a few name actors linked to it, and some set-pieces, but I'm afraid that you've seen it all before.Not a jot of originality in the whole shebang.

How did the wall go up so quickly? Why were the soldiers not behind that wall? The eye!!! Why not just use a camera? How does Scotland go 30 years without anyone wondering what's going, if people are still alive or finding a cure? Why did the prime mister shoot himself? Abs why doesn't he have better security? How does he have a gun in while isolated.
Where are the Cannibals getting their hair and makeup done? How is there a running steam train available to escape on? Why did the horseman only shoot the extra? Where are the people in the castle buying all their medieval clothing? How come it's alway so easy to escape but equally easy to die by arrow (or brick)? Seriously there is a Bentley fully fuels ready to escape in? The cannibals have cars two thirds into the movie... where were the cars when the were trying to chase a train on foot?
When did the two that got taking in a helicopter become an item? Who on earth would think a good next career move would be to lead a gang of marauding cannibals?

It doesn't make it a good movie, however, it doesn't make it a piece of crap. I really thought this film was enjoyable and i loved every minute of it.

404,SWolf15,"This film blatantly ripped of Escape from New York, one of my favourite films....",7,18 March 2008,"....However I found it a delighting homage packed with suspense, an interesting storyline, and a greatly entertaining movie with money and time well spent.Normally I would hate something that completely rips off one of my favourite films, but despite all the recycled plot devices (Mad Max-esquire splatter-punks riding on primal makeshift vehicles, the ""Snake Plissken eyepatch and love for cigarettes, the wall, intro, and even font, and even the King Lear-esquire predicament of Malcolm McDowell's character which I wonder if anyone else caught.) I found the overall experience to be highly original.Cons: The reason this did not get a higher rating is because 1: I found the pacing of the film far too fast. Though it added to the suspense, it did not allow for character development. I found the ""Virus"" kind of hokey as the plot device is overdone. Also it wasn't an instant classic or anything with such a breathtaking experience that I would rate it any higher. Then again there are far few of those.All in all I found that as a fan of Escape from New York, Mad Max, and even the anime Fist of The North Star(Think Roadwarrior + Enter the Dragon) I pleasantly enjoyed this great homage and have renewed hopes in the genre.Rating Key: 01: Total Trash 02: Worthless 03: Pretty Bad 04: Disappointing 05: Decent 06: Entertaining 07: Greatly entertaining 08: Awesome! 09: Breathtaking 10: Enlightening",Doomsday

At first there was a lazy line or two which made me worried, but then I settled in to see how it played out. Then the convoy of heavily-armed soldiers was attacked. Don't worry, this isn't a spoiler, as you've already seen that scene about a thousand times.I started skipping through the next half-hour or so, which is only notable as being written entirely using Word's cut-and-paste function.Then we hit the 1:26:03 mark.

The script is a convoluted mish-mash of clichés and irrelevant offal, and I find it unbelievable and downright depressing that any prospective producer actually read this trite and decided it was worthy of the reported budget of $30 million. It's enough to make you lose all faith in humanity - never mind the mess that is the British film industry.This film is essentially a shameless rip-off of 'Threads' (dull exposition scene at the beginning), 'Aliens' (bunch of inept soldiers go into a dangerous area), 'Escape from New York' (said soldiers then get attacked by human survivors who for some unexplained reason have regressed to become psychotic, cannibalistic Punks who listen to Fine Young Cannibals and eat human flesh from paper plates - nice one Niel, see what you did there... really clever!), 'Mad Max' (the car chase scene at the end, which to be fair is the only half-decent part of the film) etc etc. This film is essentially just a rip-off of all the great action films from the 80's and early 90's that we all loved - and it's quite simply a waste of money that insults the audience at every level.The mysterious 'Reaper disease' is just that, mysterious! We are simply told that it is really deadly and contagious - and that's pretty much it! I suppose that Neil Marshall just assumed we'd all seen 28 Days Later and therefore in turn we would assume that it's just the same deal as the Rage virus... The symptoms are also shamelessly similar to the Rage virus... LAZY LAZY LAZY!!! Quite why the people of Glasgow have regressed to the state of leather-wearing punks is also unexplained - why not 70's disco divas, 50's style teddy boys or even Mods??? Come on Neil, have a bit of imagination fella - or was it easier to rip off Mad Max 3!!! - and quite why their leader had his own Pulp Fiction-style Gimp is also unclear - there is (like many things in the film) just no real reason for it! Then there is the Medieval clan headed by Malcolm (soon to sack his agent) Macdowell - again, why oh why oh why??? Add to that a poor performance by Bob (literally just reading his lines) Hoskins and you have another reason not to watch this film. You do actually feel somewhat sorry for both Hoskins and Macdowell - how could they have gone from The Long Good Friday, and Clockwork Orange etc to this... How depressing.The only positive thing that I can say about this film is that at least there is someone making British action films - albeit profoundly bad ones.To sum up, it is a dreadful advert for British cinema, a lazy script, poor performances, dreadful dialogue, and a half-decent car-chase.

I mean, at one point I feel like I'm watching a Mad Max-type film and the next thing I know, the group is being chased by a knight that looks like it came straight out of Lord of the Rings.Another thing that I LOVED about the movie was the gore in it. I wouldn't recommend it for the weak stomaches, but thats just because of a scene where anarchists eat a guy (I had to leave for a minute just because of the thought of eating someone). Other than that, It's no more gory than Dawn of the Dead, or any other modern Zombie Movie for that matter.Like I said, don't go into see this (if its still in a theater, there were only the three of us, and we went to the five o'clock showing) expecting a smart action film. It was actually quite funny just because I found most of it to be pretty bad ass, especially the ending chase scene. We were laughing throughout the whole thing, but it was more of a ""DUDE! He just got his head cut off!"" than a ""what an idiot!"". I would HIGHLY recommend this to almost ANY fan of Mad Max, or any early 80's action movie for that matter. All in all a great dumb action gore-fest that requires little to no thinking.",Doomsday
422,J_Nek,"The grind house is back, despite what some would like to think.",9,20 March 2008,"It seems that Doomsday is to Planet Terror what Zombi 2 was to Dawn of the Dead. In fact, I almost wish the studio had been able to title this Planet Terror 2, so it could stand by that DVD on my shelf when it is released.Although last year's Grindhouse was a financial failure, it seems like studios have returned to classic 70s B-movie schlock. And that IS NOT a bad thing! Films like this are the best things gracing the silver screen at this time.Like an old Roger Corman produced flick, Doomsday switches genres and pays homage to many of these types of films throughout. The flick starts off with a horrible epidemic, like Day of the Dead. Next thing you know, a chick that looks like the old Pam Grier of classics like Coffy is in the middle of a drug deal. Cut to the Escape from New York style enlistment of a bad-a** babe who knows the score. She and a small squad of soldiers head into the barren wasteland filled with flesh eating creatures (cannibals) like something out of Aliens. Then the soldiers are captured by a gang of uber-punks (the cannibals), a mixed homage to Road Warrior and The Warriors. They escape into the country side, which for some reason reminds me of Jurassic Park, with its lush jungles. In comes a knight on horseback, catapulting the audience (no pun intended) into a medieval setting. They escape from an gladiatorial arena (similar to Escape from New York, or Star Wars Episode II). Next they're having a huge car chase (a little bit of the Warriors, Road Warrior and Death Proof). The film concludes with the uncovering of a massive conspiracy.This was probably the best film to be released yet in 2008. The latest great homage to 70s and 80s exploitation comes out close to the one year anniversary of its superb predecessor.",Doomsday
423,redkoolaid83,I walked out....,2,19 March 2008,"I'm actually surprised at how well received this movie is. It started out alright until I heard some of the dialog. What terrible script writing. I mean they stole a lot or should I say ""paid homage"" to many elements from every good post apocalyptic movie(IE. Mad Max, Escape from New York, 28 Days Later, Resident Evil), so why couldn't they at least come up with better dialog or at least better actors. I felt like the movie was written by video game writers(no disrespect to them) but come on this is a movie. I would have been more entertained if this was a game. At least I could be shooting at those bad guys in the middle of all that crappy acting. There was plenty of blood and gore but thanks to movies like SAW and Hostel, I'm so disillusioned by all that so I wasn't that impressed. Well needless to say I was very upset with having to pay 10 bucks to watch this. I wouldn't have minded watching it on DVD..... OK let me change that, I wouldn't mind watching this on the SCI FI. channel late at night when I can't sleep.A story redone over and over, bad acting and dialog, excessive but meaningless gore, and ridiculously high ticket prices make this a movie I would never recommend to watch in the theater.

It is over the top mindless violence and action. It really reminded me of Planet Terror for some reason just with the better acting. If you at all get sick or need to look away from blood and guts, I strongly do not recommend seeing this being that there is A LOT of it. With the poor story line, they needed something to back them up and violence was the ingredient.There were some parts I really had to throw in the back of my mind because they were just fat out unnecessary, but all in all I will be picking this one up come DVD release.",Doomsday

But Doomsday is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And I didn't like it. Picture this: an Aeon Flux reject from Resident Evil is sent to an area walled off 30 years after a crazy virus kills off thousands of people. Why is she sent? To find the cure of course! Outside of the Wall she finds a whole bunch of cannibalistic gutter punks. Aside from some hilariously bad dialogue, and the cannibals, there are knights (thats right, from Medieval times!), ridiculous stunt driving with lots of explosions, and plenty of walks across the countryside with hobbit-like survivors of the plague, looking like they are trekking to Mordor. I think it was about that time I got a case of the giggles and had to excuse myself. This movie was one of the most gratuitous, ridiculous wastes of time ever!

This movie leaves you with wanting more, more, more! And I do hope they make many more sequels! The casting was very well placed. The main character wasn't too baby faced or fragile, she fit the role nicely. There was a lot happening in the plot but they made the flow work out glorious!

To be fair, there are some very amusing moments but they are are few and far between.I don't like it when films abruptly switch genres either. This kept flapping from action, to sci-fi, to dark comedy to gruesome horror. If two elements are mixed together (i.e. comedy and pathos in In Bruges) that's fine. I don't like it when things keep switching or start as one genre and then have another genre tagged on the end (i.e. From Dusk Till Dawn and Shaun Of The Dead).There are also some genuinely nasty moments in this film as well. I won't tell you what they are as it's not fair to do so. But if your stomach is weak, I'd recommend you give this a miss.Overall rating: 04/10",Doomsday

Of course the movie's not without its flaws and is far from perfect but overall, its a fun movie which captivates the viewer and holds your attention throughout the movie. There's plenty of gore and non-stop action to satisfy action fans everywhere.

It's an overly absurd piece of work that made me wish I had spent the 1 hour and 49 minutes shaving off my own eyelids.The makers of this dumb flick tried to combine a gloomy, futuristic world with medieval times without involving flashbacks or time travel. The characters are one dimensional and/or over the top, and the action scenes are ultra-boring.

432,bkeithg,Derivative,5,26 March 2008,"I went in this movie with low expectations. I was hoping for a fun, lightweight popcorn movie that might creatively rip off similar movies. It turned out that it just ripped off similar movies. There were clever touches and some enjoyable attention to detail but those brisk moments of relief were too far apart.The problems started for me in the beginning. All of the best films of this genre never had lengthy set ups. In Escape to New York, the president is caught and Snake is on his way in and that's all you really need to know. In the Road Warrior, Max just shows up out of nowhere right into the action. This movie had a long winded exposition by Malcom McDowell and a superfluous action scene aboard a ship.The film had moments of potential, after the introduction of Sol and the final chase come to mind, but there was quite a bit of nothing going on in between. There were also more than a few clichés. About the only thing missing was a cat jumping out of the shadows.It may have been intended as an homage to other movies of the genre but it's tributes only served to remind me of how these other films were much more superior and I ended up leaving the theater wanting to see The Road Warrior.In fairness to the movie I probably did go in comparing it to these other post-apocalyptic films and maybe my expectations were actually higher than I originally thought but despite that it was still a pretty bland film.",Doomsday

Although by the advertisements it didn't seem that good of a movie I do not regret going. The whole story seems like a mix of ""I am Legend"", ""Aeon Flux"", and ""Smokin' Aces"", if you liked either one, I'm pretty sure you're going to like this movie a lot. And don't be too weary about all the gore in the previews, it's actually also pretty funny, and the comedy is evenly placed through the movie so if you're not really into the anarchy, you'll at least get some laughs out of it.",Doomsday

436,lone_watcher,Combines the best of Mad Max + Escape from NY,8,16 March 2008,"Doomsday is like a combination of two 1981 movies: Escape From New York, starring Kurt Russell, and Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, starring Mel Gibson. However, to quote a line from Clint Eastwood's The Dead Pool, ""It's not a rip-off. It's an homage."" The road battles are clearly meant to evoke the classic Mad Max scenes.Frankly, I liked it better than either of those old movies. Escape from NY was kind of campy, and the star character, Snake Pliskin, was a clichéd tough guy, almost a spoof of Russell's other tough guy roles. The back story -- Manhattan has been turned into a giant prison -- is a lot less believable than Doomsday's: an area quarantined because of an epidemic. (Who knows, bird flu might make that happen!) Also, Mad Max had nothing but punk-rocker look-a-likes battling it out on the road. Doomsday has a lot more, and the characters are more nuanced instead of being two-dimensional -- yet it has just as many thrills and action scenes.Will it win an Oscar? No. Was it a fun time and worth the money? Absolutely.",Doomsday

Though it might have been to pay homage to movies such as 28 Weeks Later, Mad Max or Escape From New York; it really didn't pay homage to them. It basically rips off them and blatantly copies their ideas. It has way too many cheesy lines; even for me. I love cheesy action movies such as Badboys (which I think is an excellent movie) but this movie is so very unrealistic. At one point the main character drives a Bentley through a bus without a scratch on it. Other than the over the topness of it, horrible lines/acting/ending, and a weak plot; it does have a few bad-ass fight scenes. Aside from the gore, violence, and special effects, its not worth seeing in theaters.

The same car surely was more durable than the armored car though, since it jumped through a bus (explosions etc) WITHOUT even a scratch.I mean, come on...Had they put some effort in it, and ""justify"" some of these events, the movie would have been entertaining and fun to watch.

Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed ""The Descent"", ""28 Days"" & ""28 Weeks Later"". Another sensational aspect is the ""great find"" that Rhona Mitra has been for the main role.

The story can be somewhat confusing since there is no in between back story for the main character of ""Eden"" but she is given a past and a future which is where she carries on the story from. I loved the set and location designs, which I am sure were done up with a lot of special effects. I loved the costume designs as well, especially for the short lived character of ""Viper"" it would have been interesting to see a bit more of her, though she is not really an actress her forte is Stunts, so I suppose it made sense to Axe her out of the story sooner versus later. I thought it was interesting that a few of the actors from ""Dog Soldiers"" were scattered about this film, like Emma Cleasby who played Eden's mother int he opening sequence. And also Darren Morfitt, who I didn't think was much of a Character actor until I saw this film. I loved the way the two separate groups of survivors defined themselves from the outside world then. That Sol's people were cannibal ravers who rode skeleton motor bikes, and Dr. Kane just went Medieval, which seemed to be a more effective way to adapt. Rhona Mitra was really great as Eden, she was a fantastic actress, her stunt work looked great and she was very convincing. She reminded me a lot of other characters I'd seen like Ellen Ripley or Sarah Connor. A Character who is able to adapt to any and all circumstances and come out of every experience with a greater knowledge. It was great to see a film like this with a very strong female lead, a lot of horror/sci-fi genre last girl's are only alive by sheer luck , not by actually fighting their own battles head on. There were a few ridiculous things about the film, like Sol keeping Viper's dead body in his passenger seat, and things like that. But altogether it was a well thought out film and very suspenseful and entertaining. and after reading every bad posting here's another conclusion. you all are a tough audience. Doomsday has a lot of promise in concept. Scotland has been quarantined by the Brits after the outbreak of a particularly nasty looking plague. As this plague looks set to hit England a team of crack soldiers go into the no-mans land of Scotland to attempt to find a cure. Instead they clash with a progressive society of neo-punks remniscient of Mad Max and Escape from New York and also a regressive society of Medieval Knights. The key problem with Marshall's latest outing is that he doesn't seem to know quite what tone to go for. Some moments such as the bleak opening scene seem to strive for a serious tone that explores the human condition. Yet some elements such as a car chase set to Frankie Goes to Hollywood seem to undermine this and show that Marsall wants a more broad comedy. Frankly its difficult to tell what he wants and it shows. A muddled mess of a story that when it shows some glimmers of promise frequently bastardizes it and leaves you feeling quite unsatisfied.Suggestion: Avoid and watch Escape for NY instead.",Doomsday

I've read a lot of the other comments, where the haters try to dissuade people from checking this out, but if you're looking for a cool campy post-apocalyptic action/gore fest, then you've definitely come to the right place. While this movie introduces few original ideas, it turns out to be just good plain old fashion bloody fun.",Doomsday
454,baker89,Another virus out brake filled with torture.,3,11 November 2008,"As I'm not a fan of torture/violent movies, this one is beyond my recommending. the film is based in London, with a virus out brake. And besides a little girl being shot in the eye, and more senseless beating at the start. This film seemed watchable. But as it went on with cooking a soldier in front of hundreds of spectators. My DVD found itself outside on the road, along with the Saw series (no joke). there's a lot of action and gun shooting through out the film, which i love in movies. But it took the violence a bit fare. the use of technology and special effects are amazing, along Brittan after the virus has killed nearly everyone. If this movie is not already rated R, it should be.",Doomsday
455,draciron-1,A near miss but just didn't work.,3,13 November 2008,"Mad Max meets 29 days later. The acting was mostly very good. Lee-Anne Liebenberg even though she had only a few lines gave an impressive and memorable performance. In fact she nearly stole the show her impact on the movie was so great. Too bad the writing was so weak. Rhona Mitra did the best job she could but the role she was playing should have been played by a guy. She or any other woman is just not believable in the way the movie was done. You could believe Schwarzenegger doing some of the things they had Mitra doing but it just didn't work with her. The lead role was really written for somebody like Kurt Russel or Harrision Ford.The mandatory car chase scene was a distraction. Not exciting, a distraction from the plot and not even all that interesting. Except where Viper's head falls off it was a complete waste of film. It was stolen strait from a Mad Max movie. I kept waiting for Mel Gibson to show up during the scene. It was great in Mad Max but really didn't fit in this movie.The core concept could have been a really great movie. The Reaper virus, the mishandling by the government of the situation, anarchy, the works. First rate actors, first rate photography, great stunt work, but the script was so worn out that you yawn through half of it. The cannibalism made no sense, they run over a cow on the way in amidst great herds of cattle and they are eating people? The relationships between Sol, his sister and their father just didn't work.Worth watching the first half just to see Lee-Anne Liebenberg and the way she just grabs the screen while she's on it. After that your not missing anything if you take the movie out. In fact you can probably predict event by event what will happen right up to the last scene of the movie.",Doomsday

Think of the tribes still being found today because they had no contact with the outside world and hence, no progress + reverting back to the medieval times is just a way for a psychotic old man to have complete power. Furthermore the idea of not finding a cure for a virus within 30yrs is plausible. Viruses are constantly mutating at rapid rates. Think of the influenza virus, the aids virus etc; some viruses have no cure and coupling with the fact that they had no safe form of the virus to culture until the end shows that this scenario is entirely plausible; although extreme.",Doomsday

It is really, really an awful film with elements of so many other movies but it fails to capture any of their charm. Both Mad Max and Escape from New York are classic films which they are trying to pay homage to, but they have missed the mark by so much.

There is lots of violence and gore and then some. The three major villains are completely one dimensional and one never really understands why it is that they do what they do. The entire setting for the film, needed for the lead to be doing what she's doing, is hilariously implausible. Then there are those scenes that just really make no sense at all, like the prime minister shooting himself with a vintage revolver. But what really nailed it for me was the fact that at the end of the movie there's a protracted scene involving Rhona Mitra driving a Bentley Continental GT on a smooth wide open road while trying to get away from some punks on dirt bikes and two guys in what appears to be a 1970's Datsun hatchback, and she fails to do so miserably! Maybe it was a hybrid.",Doomsday

But the story line is sooooooooo stupid.A virus breaks out and 25 years later there are still survivors in the quarantine area..... AND THEY'VE GONE CANNIBALISTIC IN LESS THAN ONE GENERATION??!! These people are the same age or older than Eden (Rhona Mitra's character). She was roughly 3-5 when she got evacuated so many of the bad guys in the movie should be the same age or even older (some perhaps younger).What about the effing HERD OF COWS that the insertion team run into within minutes of going ""over the wall""?!!?!? You're telling me that after 25 years behind a huge frigging' wall that NOBODY found out there were hundreds of cattle roaming the landscape? Don't even get me started on that rabbit the auto turret almost greased.And the plot's hinge point..... Dr. Kane.... here's a doctor that QUOTE ""if anyone could find a cure to the virus it's him"".... And he couldn't figure out that an immune survivor's blood could be used to create vaccine or cure. I get that he's mad at the society that shut him in to die. But he said in the movie that there was no cure. Some renown doctor.And then there's the car and cell phone that work great after sitting in crates in a cave for 25 years. Yeah. Cell phone tech would not have changed in that amount of time (and you can get dialed out without an account too!). Gasoline can sit in the drums and not go bad. And the survivors roaming the countryside who use the ""shortcut"" passed the crates never bothered to take a peek inside them?!? And Kane's daughter is dumbfounded by what a car is when her brother Sol drives around in a skin covered Bentley with his Road Warriorettes? This is not high cinema art but it's also not good sci-fi or apocalypse writing.The only redeeming things in the movie are Rhona Mitra and introducing me to Lee-Anne Liebenberg (she was very good in her role).",Doomsday

463,blazindragon1,Over Glorified Car Commercial,3,14 March 2008,"Well this movie had great hopes for it. It started out with a promising beginning with the introduction of the reaper virus. After that they introduced the main character and she needed some voice work or better script. The rest of the movie was a mush of several themes. It went from 28 Days Later to Mad Max to First Knight and then they opened a box that lit up with a brand new car inside. A car that had sat in a bunker for 35 years or something that had not been damaged, had not been eaten through by its fluids, was gassed up, and keys in the ignition. I have no idea what car it was but the end 20-30 minutes was an over glorified car commercial. They drove it on long stretches and avoided things on the road. It did J-turns and went off road, was able to drive itself almost when the driver was being attacked. It could go through a bus without damage while the bus exploded. It was such a product placement.SO! This movie turned out to be a disappointment. HUGE disappointment. The people beside of me said they thought it was funny and they didn't realize they went to a comedy. My personal favorite part was the stretch of road where there was a car chase happening, one of the motorcycles skidded out in the middle of the road. The car behind it was going to hit it and when it barely love-tapped it the car exploded in to a giant ball of flame! Huge fireball of inferno! I love that that happens all the time in real life. You know a motorcycle accident and giant explosions.If you're looking for some product placement, poor script writing, or to see unbelievable/unrealistic stuff then go see it. I saw it for free and I still feel bad because I wasted my time on it. Some people probably enjoyed this movie but I felt stupid afterwords. I felt like I need to go watch a documentary or go learn something so I didn't feel like my mind rotted a bit away from this terrible movie.",Doomsday

Now after 25 years living in that environment, eating a human should be a daily act not something to celebrate. And what is funny, is when the armored truck hit a COW among HUNDREDS OF COWS!!. The acting was terrible. It was so obvious who is the bad and who is the good right from the start. Bob Hoskins was very disappointing, he can do much better than this. Another funny thing is when they found the BENTLY!!. It started easily after 25 years of storage!!.Bottom line Neil Marshall please do not make movies like this.",Doomsday

Besides being a(nother) Resident Evil rip-off, and a bad one, it's so, so, so wildly retarded. It stands on the premise that if, for some reason, a country is closed down (in this case, a disease), you suddenly start acting like its year one all over again! The hair, the clothes, the deserted cities, and the cannibalism. Oh yeah, because they say that they HAD to start feeding on each other, because of the lack of food, although the FRIST THING you see when the special team goes in, it's... A BLOODY COW! And there's LOADS of them there too! And that's not all, that's just on faction of the recluses. The other part, instead of MAD MAX like people (another total rip-off), are EXACTLY like they where living the Middle Ages. WHY? OH WHY?! They actually have armors, live in castles, dress in potato bags... Ride horses! Why, for everything's sake?! It's the year 2035!!! Why would anyone act like that?! Also, the first lot, as i said, live in cities, and the second on dense woods. Loads of trees and vegetation. And the best part is that both places are divided by some scarce, what... 5 miles, and through a tunnel, that no one cared to explore, and turns out has cell phones and a Bentley inside.This is one of the worst movies i've ever seen, plot or script wise.",Doomsday

The movie starts in a desperate end of the world scenario where a killer virus threatens the entire UK, but from there it descends into a bizarre mix of The Lord of the Rings, The Road Warrior, 28 Days Later, and Braveheart with extremely stylized and over the top gore. The movie in no way takes itself seriously. It also pays homage to movies of the 1980's such as Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome with leather clad biker outlaws. Overall a very interesting mash up with many different inspirations. Although many people hated it, I thought it was very entertaining.",Doomsday

I was not very surprised to find my judgement made earlier in the week on the basis of a verrry extended trailer was depressingly accurate. I've noticed ""doomsday"" is very over promoted with trailers showing the ""best bits"" of the film during the breaks on Film 4, surely the makers and more so investors and distributors are well aware of what they have on their hands and the marketing push has begun! I think the market is presently over saturated with the post-apocalyptic genre of movie, and the last thing we need is another which hasn't been done well particularly well. I was a fan of 28days/weeks and this British effort pales in comparison to the two. The plot of ""doomsdays"", especially on paper, looks to be remarkably similar. Outbreak of virus, London and rest of UK devastated, marines looking for survivors, but things take turn for worse. Cue the...race of ""neo-punks"" characterised by the obligatory mo-hawks and riding trail bikes adorned with skeletons no less! Now we reach this films only differentiating factor from the array of other viral/zombie outbreaky type films.

This movie brought back those memories of how bad of quality those tapes actually were with there hiss and painful splicing of songs that were recorded from the radio - but none the less they hold a place in our hearts because of the memories they contain. So here is a perfect mixed tape of a movie - painfully spliced together, but still has us engaged because its all we have at the moment.This movie managed to go from 28 Days to Aliens to Mad Max to Braveheart to Gladiator back to Road Warrior to Fast and the Furious 3: Tokyo Drift and end up at Chronicals of Riddick all in an hour and a half. OK, so I was reaching at the last two titles mentioned, but after you see this movie you will see that they practically ripped the pages out of the scripts of the movies just mentioned to patch this one together.None the less, it was highly entertaining and probably one of the rowdiest movies I have ever seen. I think the editor was on coke the whole time he was at work for this one, but maybe that is what made it easier to sit through. If you want some nostalgia of some of your favorite movies growing up flashed into an hour and a half mixed tape, then this movie is for you.

The gladiator type fight scene was pathetic at the ends. The car chase simply didn't make any sense, moreover the music in the background at that time was of no relation to the tempo and need of the movie. The tank they prepared to go on broke with bare hands having stones. Well there was only gore and lots of blood in action but no style neither any tensed moments which are back bone for any good action sequences.Then, Suspense/Thriller - No way, there was no thrill rides at all, neither any suspenseful moments.

It seems that in the future man cant even make good tanks to penetrate!Then, Drama - Ahh there was entirely no drama over here, at least not any such that is mentionable. Bottomline - This effort goes flatly all in vain in all departments. Do have a pack of cigarettes (if you smoke) with you while watching to get the time passed on.

This movie is a romp people, but it really made me think about some things: 1. What happens to a population that is sealed in and left to die 2. That population is Scottish, and this movie is written by an English gentleman 3. I should not try to reconcile some of the things that did not make sense because this movie is a romp 4. Am I offended in any way by the portrayal of Scottish people ""de-evolving"" into blood thirsty Picts with non hygienic practices where morality is the exception?
